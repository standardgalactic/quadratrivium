0	8480	There are so many contingencies, particularly actually on the geopolitical side, that can
10320	15360	derail what seem to be passive development at any one time. And it's a strange...
15360	19040	And this is what I think it's hard to think about, because on the one hand it is systemic,
19040	22320	but on the other hand, it is vulnerable to contingent events.
23040	30080	Today's guest is Professor Helen Thompson. Helen works at Cambridge University, where she
30080	36880	researches the political economy of energy and the long history that underpins the democratic,
36880	44160	economic, and geopolitical disruptions that we are seeing now in the 21st century. Her most
44720	52160	recent book, Disorder, hard times in the 21st century, is kind of a political science
53280	61280	mirror twin of the logic of the great simplification. Today we talk about the history of the United
61280	70240	States in the Middle East, Israel and Hamas and Qatar, Ukraine and Russia, the importance of energy
70240	78160	in the history of the world, and some speculation on what's ahead. Please welcome Professor Helen
78160	95280	Thompson. Hi Helen, great to see you. Hi Nate, good to see you too. Although we've never met in
95280	103440	person, maybe I should call you Professor Thompson. No, call me Helen. So you have an impressive
103440	111440	economic, political, science background covering history, energy, economics, politics, and much
111440	117120	more. Can you just give a brief introduction, and how did you first get interested in these
117120	124640	topics all the way back to college or high school, or what was your path? Not a tour really. I basically
125280	138240	got seriously interested in energy in I think 2013. And I came at it via really the monetary
138240	145840	environment of the post-2008 world. And I was sufficiently, I wouldn't say aware about energy
145840	149760	questions, but I was sufficiently aware of the macroeconomic implications of energy
150720	156560	to understand that there was a relationship between the post-2008 monetary environment,
157120	164400	quantitative easing, zero interest rates, and the shale boom in the US. And to understand that the
164400	169200	world economy needed shale oil, I wouldn't say that my understanding was much better than that
169200	178720	at that point. But I was trying to work out what I might write as a long book project for
179360	185600	academically that turned out not to materialize for various reasons. And I kept thinking, you know
185600	189280	what, I'm going to have to bring oil into this. And I kept trying to work out a way of doing what
189280	194640	I wanted to do about the crash and about the eurozone crisis, and bring oil into it. And then I
194640	198800	realized that was completely the wrong way to think about things and that I just needed to go in like
198800	205520	via oil. So I started trying to think about how I might write a short book by this point about
205520	213040	the macroeconomic consequences of what I now believe to be a serious oil problem for the world
213040	218320	economy. But I quickly understood that in order to think about that, I needed to think about
218320	223920	geopolitics in a way which I'd never really done before, not in any sharply incisive way anyway.
223920	231840	So I try to teach myself to think geopolitically around this time as well. And things have really
231840	237600	moved from there. I mean, the only thing I would add to that is I'm a child of the 70s. I was born
237600	248160	in 1967 in Britain. My first memory of national life in Britain is the winter of 1974, sitting around
248720	255920	at home, seven years old, my mother trying to cook in the dark evening after evening,
255920	263200	with two small children, candlelight. So I understood in a quite visual sense in a way
263200	269280	that energy had a profound impact or could have a profound impact on daily life. And I never lost
269280	275360	that. But I wouldn't say that until some point after 2013, I connected that in any way to what I
275360	280240	was trying to do as a scholar. I have a ton of questions for you, as you might imagine. Could
280240	287760	you give a one or two minute elevator pitch of your latest book Disorder Hard Times in the 21st
287760	295600	century? So what I really wanted to do in Disorder was try to explain the political shocks of the
295600	300320	2010s, with which people obviously were very familiar, not least in Britain and the United
300320	305200	States, because high on the list of shocks of that year were obviously Brexit, or were seen to be
305200	313200	anyway, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and to give them a long history. And I didn't think
313200	318880	that they were just episodes, if you like, of psychodrama in British politics or American
319520	325440	politics. I thought that each of those two things had more of a structural explanation than that.
326480	333840	And I wanted to run with the thought that actually, if I started thinking seriously
333840	339840	and systematically about these events having an energy history, that I will be able to get
339840	345920	somewhere in explaining them that more conventional accounts wouldn't. Now, I'm not enough of an energy
345920	350560	determinist where politics is concerned to think that energy explains absolutely everything. And
350560	355200	indeed, if I had thought that I probably wouldn't have spent time in the third part of Disorder,
355200	360240	writing about democracies quite in the way in which I do. But I wanted also to grapple with
360240	366480	what I see as the longstanding historical problems that representative democracy faces
366480	371040	as a form of government. And I thought there were some things, particularly actually in relation to
371040	378880	the United States and its history as a domestic oil producer, where it was possible to say that
378880	384400	there was a story to be told about the American Republic and what was going on in oil politics
384400	393440	as well. So my book kind of tries to say, look, we should have expected the disorder of the 2010s
393440	399040	because there were these significant structural forces at work centered around not only the
399040	403360	problems of fossil fuel energy, but the difficulties of the energy transition, the geopolitics of the
403360	407760	energy transition. And then unless we could understand those things, we won't get really
407760	412160	anywhere in understanding the economic, political and geopolitical world in which we live.
413120	420000	So I'm glad we're finally having a conversation on camera. My work, as you know,
420000	427280	focuses around the concept of energy blindness in finance, in economic theory, and in broader
427280	434720	culture. And it's always refreshing to talk to someone who sees not energy as everything,
434720	442480	but energy in everything like I do in a different field. So you're a political scientist and a
442480	450560	political economist in your academic stripes. Are your fields political science? Is that
450560	458160	energy blind as well? And is that changing? I'd say that political science is energy blind largely.
458800	466960	I'd say that political economy has a more complicated relationship to this. I think
466960	472640	if you go back to the 1970s and the political economy that came out of the 1970s, indeed,
472640	479200	some of the stuff that, say, I was taught as an undergraduate, I don't think it was energy blind.
479200	485280	I think that political economy was relatively energy aware, not necessarily in the
486160	492400	system dynamics of energy, but the economic and geopolitical importance of energy.
492400	498320	And then it lost that awareness. I think it kind of lost the awareness at the same time in a way
498320	504560	in which the politicians in Western countries lost their awareness. So sometime, and I struggle
504560	510320	sometimes to think, to know where I think this began, it was the late 80s or sometime in the
510320	517920	90s when I think then an energy blindness took over. I think in political economy over the last
518560	526400	few years, there is quite a bit of evidence that actually at least some people are getting serious
526400	534240	about energy again. And I've had a lot less difficulty explaining to people since my book,
534240	540960	this book came out, this longer book Disorder, why energy is as important as I'm presenting it to
540960	547520	be. When I wrote this short book called Oil on the Western Economic Crisis, which came out in 2017,
548080	552080	then I still think most people thought, why is she writing about that?
553280	560080	Well, it didn't hurt the tailwinds for your book that it came out the exact same time that Putin
560080	566560	invaded Ukraine. No, I mean, in the UK, it came out on the actual day of the invasion.
566560	574320	Oh my gosh. So that was a strange experience in itself. But there were things that I was saying
574320	579040	that suddenly people who weren't particularly interested in energy and I think didn't think
579040	582880	they wanted to be interested in energy suddenly would tell me that they were reading it and they
582880	588240	would say, oh, that makes sense. And I give you one clear example of that was what I wrote about
588240	592960	the Suez Crisis. And I spent a lot of time thinking about the Suez Crisis trying to offer a somewhat
592960	599920	different interpretation than certainly we usually get in Britain. And I remember when I was writing
599920	604560	that chapter, and I just took the decision one day that I was actually going to make it the structural
604560	610080	pivot of the second geopolitical chapter. And I thought this could go very wrong. I mean, people
610080	614880	would just think that it's some kind of apology for British imperialism. And then because of what
614880	619840	was happening with Ukraine and the pipelines and the issue of transit and these big shifts,
620880	626240	then almost everybody who was asking me questions in the first few weeks after the book came out
626240	631680	in the UK wanted to talk to me about the Suez Crisis. I'm going to jump around a bit, Helen,
631680	639280	but since you brought that up, could you briefly describe the Suez Crisis and speculate on whether
639280	646320	we're going to have another one? Yeah, I mean, the second part of that's a really very interesting
647200	653600	question. I think that what's important to see from the British point of view, which I'll start with,
653600	662640	on the Suez Crisis, is that in 1956, when the British took military action with France and Israel
662720	671920	against Egypt in the light of NASA and the Egyptian president nationalising the company that owned
672640	679760	Suez Canal, in the British government mine, the British were doing exactly what they were supposed
679760	686480	to do in the post-second world war, which was to act as an imperial power in the Middle East
686480	692400	to guarantee the oil security of Western European countries. Because American presidents were very
692400	698560	clear in the post-war second world war world, they wanted largely the oil of the Western hemisphere
698560	703760	for the Western hemisphere, obviously not least the United States itself. They were only willing to
703760	710640	provide oil to Western Europe countries in an emergency. They didn't really want Western European
710640	715120	countries buying oil from the Soviet Union, certainly once the Cold War got going, that
715120	721040	meant Western European countries and Japan needed to import oil from the Middle East and they didn't
721040	726240	want to have any military responsibility in the Middle East for ensuring the free flow of oil
726240	731520	through the Persian Gulf. That was the British job. Obviously they didn't want the British
731520	737520	behaving in brazen ways like an imperial power that made it very difficult for them with Arab
737520	742560	states, but nonetheless, if there was a threat to Western European energy security, then Britain
742560	747120	was supposed to act as an imperial power and do something about it, which is what British did in
748000	754640	the autumn of 1956 and then Eisenhower obviously up for re-election didn't want that kind of display
754640	761520	of European imperialism, particularly at a time when the Soviet Union was sending tanks into
762240	770160	Budapest and put such financial pressure on the British government, financial pressure that was
770160	776720	made possible by Britain's desperate need now to find dollars to buy American oil because
777920	783680	the Arab states were boycotting the sale of oil through one of the pipelines and the Suez canal
783680	789520	was closed, that it was very easy for Eisenhower to tell the British Prime Minister Antony Eden,
790320	794480	you're out. With the British not being able to continue neither could the French and neither
794480	799120	ultimately could the Israelis. If we just look at it for a moment from the Israeli
800000	807920	point of view, what that showed in 1956 was how vulnerable that they were on transit issues
807920	812960	and that was both about the Suez canal itself, but it was also about the Strait of Turan,
812960	820720	which is like water that gets them up the eastern side of the Sinai Peninsula and made
820720	828480	it possible, would make it possible in time for Iran to sell oil to Israel and that became
828480	836800	a really central issue for Israel, including then in 1967 when NASA closed the Strait of Turan
836800	843600	again and then kept the Suez canal closed for eight years, the second time.
843600	847120	So what happened then during those eight years, the ships had to go all the way around?
847920	855280	Yeah, I mean if it wasn't coming pipeline, it has to go all the way around Africa and
855280	861360	interestingly in that context that is part of the reason then why from 1967 the British
861360	865600	government concludes it can no longer stay in the Middle East, it can no longer carry on being an
865600	872400	imperial power there because suddenly the the oil costs that Britain faces in the wake of the
872400	876960	Six Day War where it's also subject to a embargo, a much greater.
877680	884880	So in addition to culture being energy blind, it's possible that energy experts and
884880	892560	culture are geopolitics and complexity blind. I mean can you imagine, I'm sure you can,
893280	900320	you're an expert on this, the importance of the Suez canal and the Strait of Hormuz as being open
900320	909120	and free and navigable for the rest of the world just in time things and both of those are within
909120	916320	the arena of the current conflict. I think most people don't even think about those important
916320	923440	choke points. No, I mean obviously this raises the second part of your question. I mean if we
923440	928240	look at Israel's position in this though, there's been a really quite substantial change
928960	936240	from the situation either in 1956 for Israel or in 1967. So in the aftermath of the Suez
937200	946480	crisis through to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, then Iran was the principal exporter of oil
946480	952880	to Israel. None of the Arab states were willing to sell oil to Israel. The United States was
952880	961760	operating with its not exports accepting an emergency. So the only state really that was
961840	974160	willing to sell oil to Israel on a contracted basis was with the Iranians. And that was one of
974160	981600	the reasons why in 1967 that NASA blockaded the Straits of Tehran because he wanted to stop
982240	987040	Iran selling oil to Israel. He thought that that was a fundamental weakness of the Islamic world
987040	997760	in dealing with Israel back in 1967. But then when we get to the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution,
997760	1004560	although that there's some covert selling of oil by Iran to Israel, this time like through a land
1005360	1013280	pipeline rather than through the Straits of Tehran, Israel starts looking for other options.
1013280	1019040	It gets a guarantee from the Americans that in an absolute emergency the Americans will provide
1019040	1026080	oil. But if we look at who is the number one exporter of oil to Israel today, it's Azerbaijan.
1027360	1033360	It comes via like pipeline that the vulnerability for Israel in that is actually Turkey's position
1033360	1039360	because the pipeline's coming through Turkey. In terms of the relationship between the Israeli
1039360	1043120	government and the Azerbaijani government, it's quite strong. Israel's also selling arms
1044000	1049040	to Azerbaijan. But it's the transit. It's the transit through Turkey that is probably on that
1049040	1059440	respect, Israel's vulnerability. So let's put a pin in that. 1979 was a key year in the Middle
1059440	1066160	East because Egypt recognized Israel. The Shah of Iran was overthrown. Israel gave up its oil
1066640	1074720	in Sinai as a part of developing better relations with Egypt. And the Iranian Revolution then cut
1074720	1080640	off Israel from oil supply that the Shah had provided, as you mentioned. So you've observed
1080640	1087600	that these events made the USSR somewhat irrelevant in that part of the world until the
1088320	1094800	Syrian civil war 30 years later, 40 years later. Is there a parallel between the Abraham Accords
1096640	1104080	in which Saudi Arabia was poised to join the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco in normalizing relations with
1104080	1110960	Israel earlier this year? And Iran now feeling potentially less relevant in the Middle East
1110960	1118000	in the same way Russia became after 1979? I think there are possibly some parallels here.
1118320	1125440	I think that there's, well, I think that there's a paradox, which I don't still think I really
1125440	1130720	have got to grips with in trying to understand the events of the last few weeks. Because if we
1130720	1137440	think about the course of the last few years, in particularly actually the first part of this year,
1138000	1143440	we could see two different things, at least two different things, really opposite things going
1143440	1149280	on. The first of them, as you said, Nate, was the possibility, the strong possibility it would seem
1150400	1156160	that the Abraham Accords were going to be extended to Saudi Arabia. And at that point,
1156160	1164240	you could see that actually not only was Israel going to be able to normalize relations with a
1164240	1169280	growing number of Arab states, including now the most significant one, but that that was quite
1169360	1175600	complementary to various of the economic relations, including energy relations that Israel was
1175600	1182560	cultivating with Arab states, not least being able to do so, because since some point in the 2010s,
1182560	1189120	Israel has been able to export, I think it's from 2017, has been able to export gas from its offshore
1189920	1198960	eastern Mediterranean gas fields, and two of the states that it exports to have been Jordan
1198960	1206240	and Egypt. You've also got UAE involvement in at least one of those gas fields. So you could see
1206240	1211680	that there was a kind of, not economic unity would be going too far, but economic interdependence
1211680	1218560	growing between Israel and various of the Arab states takes Saudi Arabia into that. That is a
1218640	1225360	big deal, a really big deal. And in one sense transformative, I think, from Israel's point of
1225360	1233280	view. And then you might say, well, Iran shut out of that, no possibility of that kind of
1233280	1239520	relationship between Israel and Iran tries to sabotage it, though that runs into the issue of
1239520	1244080	whether they really did know that Hamas was going to attack. But on the other hand, if you look
1244160	1248320	up to what was going on this year, is you had the rapprochement, the diplomatic rapprochement
1248320	1255520	between Saudi Arabia and Iran, brokered it would seem on the surface anyway, by the Chinese,
1255520	1261920	perhaps United Arab Emirates played some part, perhaps Putin played some part. So actually,
1261920	1270560	you had growing Saudi, apparently anyway, growing Saudi Iranian relations or defrosting, let's say,
1270560	1275680	relations during the same period in which Iran might not like it's been left out of the Abraham
1275680	1281200	Accords. And I still think trying to understand how both those things were going on at the same
1281200	1289440	time, I still think that's a bit of a puzzle. Is it possible? I am absolutely no expert here,
1289440	1298000	which is why I'm asking you. But there has been obviously tribal conflicts in humanity back to
1298000	1305520	the Pleistocene. But a big one is between the Shia and Sunni factions of the Muslim
1305520	1313760	faith. Is it possible that the aversion to the West, the United States, Israel,
1315360	1324320	is enough an aversion that it could unite some of the previous antagonistic tribes in the area?
1324320	1329840	And it could be Middle East, Asia versus the West from this current conflict. Do you have
1329840	1341920	any thoughts on that? I think that that is quite hard to imagine or at least not to see that the
1342720	1350560	fault lines would assert themselves quite quickly. I mean, I give you one like example,
1350560	1358880	is the complete difficulty that the Bush administration had persuading the Saudis that
1358880	1366560	they had to make some kind of accommodation with post Saddam's Iraq, once the Shia majority were
1366560	1375680	the dominant political force in Iraq. And in that sense, it was easier for the Saudis to have,
1376640	1380000	I wouldn't say necessarily straightforwardly positive relations with the United States,
1380000	1385520	but at least complicated relations with the United States that had some payoff potentially for each
1385520	1395280	side, then it was to reestablish Iraq-Saudi relations in the post Saddam era. I think as well
1395280	1404960	that if you look at the internal politics of a number of Arab countries, including now like
1405360	1414480	Egypt as well, the idea that they really want to make common cause with Hamas, both in its
1414480	1420480	relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood, who obviously were in power in Egypt from 2011-2013,
1420480	1429280	but also then around support for Hamas, that's I think pretty destabilizing prospect in Egyptian
1430080	1435760	politics. So I think we always have got a factor into this, like what the risks around domestic
1435760	1443120	political stability are for any of the Arab states in their relations, not only with Iran,
1443120	1452640	but also with the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian cause is obviously prominent in
1452720	1460560	everyday news right now. This is recorded on Monday, October 30th. Obvious to those people that
1460560	1468400	understand the centrality of energy to our world, the effects of the Israel Hamas situation have
1468400	1475360	clear consequences for the availability of oil globally, something like half to two thirds of
1475360	1483840	the world's oil reserves are within 800 miles of Israel. But how is this conflict taken a bird's
1483840	1491760	eye view, especially during the late 20th century? How is the energy at the center of this
1492720	1497840	current conflict? Can you give a stratospheric view of that?
1498400	1509600	Well, I think there are several different things going on here. The first of them is that
1511440	1516960	Iran's position in the Persian Gulf, and to some extent its relationship with China
1517920	1528400	around the Persian Gulf are pretty central to any question about the conflict between Israel
1528400	1536400	and Hamas, spelling out into an original conflict or original war. And I think that there's a way
1536400	1543360	of thinking about that question that actually goes back to the summer of 2019, which is actually
1543440	1553040	where I started disorder. Because there we saw what happened when Iran responded to what Trump
1553040	1559440	called the maximum economic pressure being applied after Trump had entered the Iran nuclear deal with
1559440	1566560	various attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf. Then there was the attacks probably by Iranian
1566640	1573680	proxies on the Saudi oil facilities, Saudi defense system essentially failed.
1575440	1580080	And then it looked like the Americans, even under Trump, weren't going to make any response to that,
1580080	1585360	which made the Saudis incredibly angry. And then in January of 2020, so just as the pandemic was
1585360	1592720	starting in China, we had Trump ordering the assassination of Soleimani, the head of the Iranian
1592720	1598640	Revolutionary Guard. And the response of a lot of Trump's critics to that was he's so mad, he's
1598640	1606000	just about to start like World War Three. So even in the quite recent years with pandemic got in
1606000	1612000	the way of people, I think remembering what was going on in the second half of 2019 and early 2020,
1612560	1619120	we can see that conflict in the Persian Gulf has got the potential to be incredibly destabilizing.
1620080	1627600	And so any, for any conflict that moves into regional war in the Middle East, that is
1628560	1635680	will be central to it. How are we going to avoid a major war in the Middle East?
1638160	1644640	I mean, what would be the, I think you don't need to paint the worst case. Worst case is
1644960	1651840	nukes all around the world. You don't even need to paint the bad case, which is the Strait of
1651840	1660880	Hormuz closes and there's giant bombs and destruction in Middle Eastern countries. What
1660880	1666400	would be a somewhat benign and a hopeful outcome of the current situation?
1667360	1674960	I think the benign version is that the presence of the American Navy in the way in which it is
1674960	1684640	now in the Mediterranean is sufficient deterrent to Iran to ensure that Hezbollah stays out of
1684640	1692240	anything, doing anything particularly significant in northern Israel. And Iran understood stands
1692320	1701920	that there would be very direct consequences for it if it were to engage in, even in maybe even
1701920	1708640	the kind of action that it engaged in the summer of 2019 in the Strait of Hormuz.
1710480	1716880	A lot of times when there's, and here's me saying this to a political scientist expert,
1717440	1723680	it seems like there's a conflict between a country and another country. But here it's like this
1724640	1731360	complicated rat's nest of multiple countries and multiple groups and demographics and
1731360	1737200	initiatives. I mean, there's Lebanon, there's Syria, there's Russian support there, there's Iran,
1737200	1744320	there's Hezbollah, there's Hamas, there's all kinds of Houthi rebels. And it seems like there are
1744400	1747760	tiny little Archduke Ferdinand possibilities everywhere.
1748720	1759920	No, absolutely. But I think some of that, though, there's a positive story to tell about some of
1759920	1768480	the complexities of the interdependence. For instance, as I said earlier, Israel exports
1768480	1775200	gas now, at least it has been to Jordan and to Egypt. That means that these are countries that
1775200	1785280	have got something to lose from conflict with Israel in a way which has never historically
1785280	1794000	been true before the 2010s when this offshore Israeli gas production began. Now, there is some
1794000	1797680	difficulty for Egypt coming out of this. And unfortunately, it does have, I think, potential
1797680	1805200	ramifications for Europe, because one of the fields, the three main fields in the Eastern
1805200	1813920	Mediterranean that belong to Israel, Tamar is in the rocket range of Hamas. And so production is
1813920	1818880	shut down at the moment, which means that Egypt isn't getting the liquid natural gas exports
1818880	1823280	from Israel that it would usually do. It also exports itself because it has fields in the
1823280	1828640	Eastern Mediterranean. That means you'll be exporting less to Europe. And we know that European
1828640	1833200	demand for liquid natural gas is much higher than it was two years ago because of Russia's
1833200	1838400	war against Ukraine. And so these things become interconnected and disruptive.
1839200	1849920	So I'm an American and I remember what happened with President Bush and the war in Iraq.
1850160	1857920	And I have other memories of subsequent presidents. Can you outline the shifting
1857920	1863120	relationships and perspectives with the United States president's administrations
1863920	1871200	towards Saudi Arabia and the Middle East from Obama to Trump to currently Biden with the
1871200	1877920	fist bump to MBS or he refused to shake hands? But it seems like this is all an unfolding soap
1877920	1883440	opera with massive consequences for our future. Yeah, I think you'd probably need to just start
1883440	1892480	with like where things were in the Bush Jr presidency. Let's say particularly by 2005.
1893200	1904480	So once it's clear that Iraq is going to be a quagmire at best and that if a crucial purpose
1904480	1913680	which to my mind it was of the Iraq war was to remove the sanctions from Iraq's oil exports,
1913680	1921680	rebuild the Iraqi oil industry, get international oil companies back into Iraq, turn Iraq into
1923680	1929760	a large-scale oil producer rather than as it had previously been before the sanctions a medium-sized
1929760	1936320	oil producer. So producing more like 10 or 11 million barrels a day like the Saudis could.
1936960	1942640	That wasn't going to work out. It's very clear by 2005. So what we see in 2005 and I think that
1942640	1950480	the shapes of a world that we still live in is essentially that world oil production stagnated.
1951760	1958800	And then into that in the 2010s came the shale oil boom in the United States and meant that
1958880	1964880	that stagnation of production that was there I think by 2005 and it was for a whole set of reasons
1965920	1972080	including geopolitical reasons didn't play out in the way in which it would have done otherwise.
1972080	1978000	So there was no way that George Bush could find a way out of the Middle East or even think that he
1978000	1983760	could find a way out of the Middle East. I think the Iraq war should be understood as trying to
1983760	1990880	address what that administration understood really quite well was the stagnation of production that
1990880	1996000	was coming in a world in which Asian demand in general and Chinese in particular was growing
1996000	2005040	quite rapidly. I think by the time that Obama has been in office a couple of years by 2011 probably
2005760	2011360	the people in the White House with him buy this idea that shale is the fix.
2012480	2020080	Now shale is a partial fix. It stops I think economically the 2010s being a lot more difficult
2020080	2025920	than they would otherwise have been but it isn't actually a route out of the United States from
2025920	2031680	the Middle East altogether. Not least because it's the question of like where the shale oil is
2031680	2037280	going to be refined and where the American refineries are themselves well suited to all the shale that's
2037280	2043920	being produced. So the United States isn't actually losing its need to import oil from the Middle
2043920	2049040	East. It's simply reducing its need to import oil from the Middle East but I think the Obama
2049040	2055360	administration is emboldened by shale. I think it does several things. It first of all thinks okay
2055360	2060560	we can now sanction Iran which they've been quite wary about because the Europeans will protest
2060560	2066000	the oil prices will go too high if too much Iranian oil is taken off the market. We sanction them,
2066000	2071600	we bring them to the table, we get a nuclear deal with Iran. The sanctions can come off,
2071600	2077680	we can normalize relations, largely normalize relations like with Iran. That will put the
2077680	2082880	Saudis in their place a bit too. We don't have to treat them so seriously as we've
2083840	2089840	as we've generally been doing since the 1970s because we don't need them so much
2090400	2094880	and obviously it doesn't turn out like that in terms of getting out of the Middle East not least
2094880	2100880	because ISIS comes along and then he's got American troops out of Iraq by 2012 but the
2100880	2109600	Air Force is going back in in 2014. Now Trump I think then comes in the exact opposite way of
2110160	2115360	well let's I use Trump as a shorthand because who knows who exactly was making all the decisions in
2115360	2122640	the Trump White House but comes in and he is like no we need to be close to the Saudis still
2122640	2131360	we need to be tough on Iran and so he's willing to be quite tolerant of most things to do with
2131360	2139040	MBS cultivates personal relationship probably get some payoff in terms of his own corporate
2139040	2147120	material interfamily interests but I think it's quite then revealing that even when Trump is
2147120	2154160	the president in the September of 2019 when those Saudi oil facilities are attacked that
2154160	2163760	the Americans don't actually make a response. I think Biden comes in then and he's back to
2163760	2171120	flipping it the other way and he's got an added component to it which is that he I think quite
2171120	2177760	desperately wants the Iran nuclear deal back because he wants Iranian more Iranian oil on the
2177760	2183120	world markets because he doesn't want to look like he's got an oil policy at all he wants his energy
2183120	2191120	policy to look like it's just about climate and the energy transition so Iran nuclear deal you
2191120	2196880	have to know something to understand that that's it oil policy but he's not able to but in that case
2198800	2208320	you just made the supposition that Biden cares more about appearing to be a climate president
2208320	2218480	rather than actually being one because he wants the US to use less oil but if more Iranian oil
2218560	2224160	is on the world market from a CO2 perspective that's more fossil carbon being burned right?
2226000	2233600	Yeah I mean I think there obviously are like levels of like complexity to that I mean you
2233600	2242560	might also say I mean you know I don't suppose to know how much deep thinking there has been
2242560	2249520	about this question inside the Biden White House you might also say that it's quite useful if you
2249520	2257600	really understand that might be a medium to long-term oil problem that actually you keep some American
2257600	2264160	production like back and let others like take this case so there's level draining America first
2266160	2269840	absolutely I don't think that's the deep thinking but maybe maybe it is
2270720	2279920	but what we know whatever thinking was going on the policy didn't work and so already by the summer
2279920	2291520	of 2021 he was having to ask the Saudis essentially to increase output which they weren't willing to do
2291520	2302800	he then made is rather humiliating visit to Riyadh in the next summer in 2022 and the Saudis
2302800	2310560	have shown no willingness really despite the fact of working with the administration about the Abraham
2310560	2319120	accords to accommodate the Biden administration's persistent desire for more oil output from OPEC
2319120	2329200	plus so what do you think about the fact that if you add UAE Saudi Arabia and the new BRICS
2329200	2338400	nations including Russia that the amount of oil purchasable in the open market not the oil
2338400	2346800	production but the available oil exports are now over 50 percent controlled by BRICS nations
2347440	2357440	first of all is that important and a related question I'm just curious from a political
2357440	2366400	perspective people living in those nations in the Middle East that are selling the stored sunlight
2366400	2375040	from beneath their lands to the global west and of course they're getting dollars or financial
2375600	2384080	remuneration for that but it's their legacy of what they have in their lands and it's being
2384080	2390880	sold to the west do the people there ever get patriotic and nationalistic about that I mean
2390880	2396240	what is the real feeling beneath the dollar signs and barrels of oil that are flowing
2396240	2405680	I mean on the first question I think that OPEC plus matters a lot more than the BRICS
2405680	2414800	okay I mean I think if you look at it in energy terms that India and China and and Brazil as
2414800	2425040	founders are in a very different position than Russia and I think that China has its own really
2425040	2434960	quite severe still constraints around its foreign oil and gas dependency and I think it's well aware
2434960	2444480	of those I think in this case the Chinese leadership really is energy aware yeah so I think that in
2444480	2453520	terms of is there a power block that would use energy as a weapon against western countries we
2453520	2461280	should think in terms of like OPEC plus and not think in terms of BRICS okay and I think you might
2461280	2468400	say that it then really is quite significant that the Saudi Russian axis in OPEC plus has held
2468400	2474880	through Russia's invasion of Ukraine indeed strengthened because if you go back to the
2475840	2480480	aftermath of those attacks on the Saudi oil facilities you pretty much had Putin laughing
2480480	2485200	at the Saudis about the fact that the air defense system that they bought from the United States
2485200	2495920	didn't work if you go to the spring of 2020 so when the pandemic really started you have been
2495920	2501600	salmon trying to flood the market with oil after you can't reach an agreement with Putin about how
2501600	2507680	to deal with the pandemic and then you effectively have Donald Trump putting OPEC plus back together
2507680	2513760	again because he doesn't want the price of oil on the floor for American shale producers and having
2513760	2520000	to threaten the Saudis like with military withdrawal or you know military less military support unless
2520000	2528880	that they play nice with him about that so I mean OPEC plus looks pretty like weak as any kind of
2528960	2537760	cohesive block in the spring of 2020 we're a long way away from that now OPEC plus can choose to
2537760	2544000	inflict harm on the Biden administration and I think chose to do so in the run up to those mid-term
2544000	2552320	elections last November when a quite substantial cut was announced just in the weeks before when
2552320	2558800	Biden had been pressing obviously for increased output. I was going to ask you this near the end
2558800	2566240	of the interview but I'll ask it right now given what you just said have we reached the point
2566240	2573280	or are we approaching a point where the rest of the world can decouple or de facto sanction the
2573280	2581280	US and other countries in the US orbit without it having disastrous effects on their own economies?
2582320	2592960	I think you can see that in Russia's case that it has been able to inflict quite substantial harm
2592960	2601600	on European countries and in particular Germany by cutting off the supply of gas through the
2601600	2608480	Nord Stream 1 pipeline which just began to do from the summer of 2022 if you look at the economic
2608480	2615920	data coming out of Germany over the last few months it's pretty difficult that Germany has
2615920	2624560	experienced a major industrial blow by what has happened and it's not clear that the Russian economy
2625200	2633040	has taken such a big hit for having done this certainly where oil is concerned it's been able
2633040	2638640	to sell pretty much the same amount of oil as it was previously doing for a reasonably long
2638640	2645200	period of time at a lower price than the market price but even that it's not clear that that's true
2646400	2653840	any longer it's been able to increase its liquid natural gas exports it obviously doesn't yet
2653840	2660640	compensate from those for what it's lost through selling through the the pipelines that the Yamaha
2660640	2666080	pipeline and the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to European countries but it's got the capacity
2666960	2675120	to increase LNG exports further I think the Saudi question is like more difficult because the
2675120	2680720	Saudis are obviously more integrated financially into the US world and the way that the Russians
2680720	2686000	were much less so since even just then since 2014 and certainly since those financial
2686960	2692960	sanctions and Saudi obviously has this does have a military relationship with the United States and
2692960	2699600	so that acts as some kind of constraint on what the Saudis can do too so it was three weeks ago
2699600	2711040	just over when the Hamas-Israel situation exploded and at that time I thought that the
2712000	2722960	implications would be a premium on long dated oil futures and instability to the financial system
2724240	2731200	and instead oil as of today three weeks later is about at the same level it was before that
2731200	2740080	happened maybe because you say the US Navy is suppressing volatility but I was surprised and
2740080	2747120	I don't like to talk about this much because you can get in in social trouble really easily but
2747120	2753840	since you're a professional in this domain it almost feels like this entire situation
2753840	2761920	unexpectedly to me and many people is like a Middle East version of a George Floyd moment
2762880	2771920	where there are people around the world reacting to what's happening and it it it seems like that
2771920	2779680	puts the international social contract of agreements and supply chains and geopolitical
2779680	2790160	alliances and everything that we kind of assumed would continue before October 2023 might might
2790160	2797680	change just because of this you know this this zeitgeist is is changing what do you think about
2797680	2804400	that Helen well I think there's definitely something going on in that respect I think that
2807280	2812800	particularly consequentially for the Biden administration just because the US is much more
2813600	2819040	important as a power than the European states although they face some of the same domestic
2819040	2825600	political issues around this they're going to come under considerable pressure and obviously in the
2825600	2831200	case of the United States with an election next year that is going to intensify that pressure
2831200	2839440	of how far they can go in supporting Israel without causing themselves very considerable
2840000	2847360	political problems I mean I think that it it is though aided by the fact that the energy
2847360	2855120	situation thus far is not particularly I wouldn't say it's not particularly worrying because I think
2855120	2861840	it is worrying but we're not seeing a serious crisis in the energy markets in a way in which we did
2861840	2869360	pretty much immediately on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and I think that does go back to the fact
2869360	2875280	that the energy situation in the Middle East including Israel's vulnerability on energy
2875280	2882400	security issues is just not what it was in the past then we can add in the fact that the United
2882400	2890560	States as well as being now not insignificant exporter of oil has got the capacity to release more
2890560	2896080	oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 180 million barrels released really in the context of the
2897600	2903920	Russia's invasion of Ukraine none of these things were true in the 1970s indeed the whole
2903920	2911520	Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in response to the crisis of the 1970s instead of
2911520	2916480	being an exporter the United States was on a trajectory in the 1970s to become in the largest
2916480	2924880	oil importer in the in the world and so I think that the immediate crunch points around the energy
2924880	2933120	situation are nowhere near as difficult as they were in the 70s but just to go back to a question
2933120	2936880	that I didn't answer and I think this does come into matters though is I do think there's they
2936880	2941920	are still you know very profound resentment in a lot of oil producing countries amongst citizens
2943040	2948240	about what they look what looks to them like foreign extractivism with heavy legacy heavy
2948240	2957200	undertone still of the imperial past I think if you say like why was it not possible for the
2957200	2962720	international oil companies that got those contracts from the Iraqi government the western ones
2963760	2969440	essentially to stay there and do well and turn Iraq into the kind of large-scale oil producer
2969440	2975520	that the Bush administration had in mind in partly it is because of the domestic resistance that they
2975520	2982160	ran into in Iraq the political situation now partly that's to do with ISIS but it was also to do
2982160	2993440	with direct attacks on the headquarters of oil companies from angry Iraqi citizens I mean if the
2993440	3002080	experiment was can Western oil companies go back into a Middle Eastern country after the age of
3002080	3006720	energy nationalism of the 1970s and succeed well the answer turned out to be no they can't
3007680	3012560	have you been over there have you traveled in Iraq Iran no I've never been to the Middle East no
3012560	3019440	okay um and just as an aside are you teaching right now like this semester what are the what
3019440	3025120	classes are you teaching what is the title of the class I teach uh first year I part
3025120	3028720	teacher first year course which is the introduction to politics for the students and the undergraduate
3028720	3033120	program and then I teach a course called the politics of the international economy to the
3033200	3040480	third years wow and how do you enjoy that a lot I really like teaching yeah I miss it
3042160	3047600	I'm kind of teaching with the podcast but it's not the same as sitting in the room with 20 19
3047600	3054080	year olds and having a conversation you know and they're so curious and bright and have their whole
3054080	3059200	lives ahead of them and it it feels like a privilege and also a responsibility you know
3059200	3066240	completely yeah yeah yeah um so we're going to get back to the Middle East and I also want to talk
3066240	3073520	to you about Ukraine but you're a historian and could you speak briefly because I also want to
3073520	3079520	talk about the United States can you talk briefly about how energy and oil in particular really
3079600	3088560	set up Britain and later Germany to become key powers in Europe I don't think most people
3089200	3096880	look at that history from an energy perspective yeah I think that if we look at the the 19th
3096880	3106720	century and the real rise to economic preeminence of Britain I mean Britain had obviously established
3106720	3116240	itself as a perhaps the dominant naval power even in the 18th by the middle second third of the the
3116240	3123920	18th century before the industrial revolution but its economic preeminence comes with the
3123920	3129280	industrial revolution and if we say then like well why did Britain industrialize before
3130240	3137200	um any other country in the world I think that the the answer is not only that it had
3137760	3144480	significant or abundant domestic coal but also because they've been using coal actually for
3144480	3149040	a very long time for heating purposes pretty much again unlike anywhere else going back
3150080	3156400	even the 12th century certainly in the third by the 13th century uh it had
3157040	3165520	incentive to find ways of extracting deeper coal and the steam engine the first point
3165520	3171440	purpose of the steam engine was to do precisely that to be used in mining and then the steam engine
3171440	3178320	ran off coal so you kind of like it's a it's a circular phenomenon if you then look at the way
3178320	3184560	in which British naval power developed in the 19th century and you look at something that I think is
3184560	3189920	pretty significant in in in world history which is the and I say world history very deliberately
3189920	3198880	is the first opium war and the opening up of imperial um china its British steam ships um that
3198880	3210160	now um are able to be much more powerful than any sail based um navy um could be if you then look
3210160	3219440	at the German um story Germany um is advantaged like Britain by having coal a lot of coal um
3219440	3224880	but unlike Britain uh it actually doesn't have iron deposits that are adjacent to the coal
3224880	3231280	a quite a lot of the iron deposits are in Alsace-Lorraine France doesn't have coal even just saying
3231280	3236560	that like that explains I think quite a lot as to why between 1870 and the creation of Germany
3237520	3242000	through the Second World War Alsace-Lorraine is a central part of the conflict between
3242000	3249600	like France and Germany explains why the European coal and steel community the first part of
3250720	3257760	the the European project effectively was a means of giving France access to that West German
3258800	3264640	coal if we then bring oil into it the thing that's really hard for every European power except for
3264640	3269360	Austria really in the beginning of the 20th century is they don't have any domestically
3270160	3273440	if you look at the beginning of the 20th century the two large oil producers of the
3273440	3279120	United States and Russia I don't think it's a coincidence that they are going to go on
3279120	3285520	albeit in the case of Russia in the form of the Soviet Union to dominate the 20th century geopolitically
3285520	3292240	to take over the European imperial powers by contrast are going to be you know eclipsed Britain
3292240	3297120	tries to deal with its oil problem which it does sort of moderately successfully by extending its
3297120	3307280	empire around oil i.e sphere of influence in Persia what will be Iraq in the post what was
3307280	3315360	Mesopotamia what will become Iraq in the post First World War world Germany loses desperately
3315360	3319840	in that contest during the in the in the First World War it ends up with nothing in the Middle
3320800	3325600	it tries to take Baku which is the basis of the now Soviet oil industry and fails
3326480	3333120	so Hitler's invasion of Russia has puzzled historians but you suggested it was at least
3333120	3338640	partly about oil did i understand that correctly from from your work yeah i mean i'm not the first
3338640	3344400	person who who who he's made this argument though people who know a lot more about that about this
3345280	3356640	than than i do but i think that if you understand that Germany was in from its point of view and
3356640	3362400	this is i'm not talking about Weimar Germany so after the the first war in a really very difficult
3362400	3372880	position because it had lost the war in the Middle East is its bank made well one of its most
3372880	3378080	important banks if not the its most important bank Deutsche Bank which had effectively operated as
3378080	3386800	its international oil company in the pre-1914 world held 25 percent of the shares in the what was
3386800	3393120	then called the Turkish Petroleum Company which had the mandate for the concession rather sorry
3393120	3399920	for drilling in Mesopotamia and as part of the peace then Germany had to hand over or Deutsche
3400000	3410560	Bank had to hand over that ultimately to France so the Germans begin in the Weimar period on a
3410560	3416000	program of creating synthetic fuel which is essentially to create an artificial version of
3416000	3424960	oil from coal Hitler expands yeah Hitler expands that program but there is no way that he can engage
3424960	3431200	the Nazis under Hitler can engage in wall of conquest without much more oil supply than they
3431200	3438560	actually have and by 1941 the second half well by the summer of 1941 it's it's pretty clear
3438560	3445200	that the conquered territories that Germany Nazi Germany has by that point plus synthetic fuel
3445200	3453600	is not sufficient and that Hitler and Hitler was i would say apocalyptically obsessed with energy
3454560	3459120	is is that he thought that there's only way forward for Germany if he was going to stay in
3459120	3464720	the war was to conquer Baku which is in present day Abajajam which was then the center of the
3464720	3476080	Soviet oil industry this is going to sound like a obtuse question but if oil is the master resource
3476080	3481200	and what you said Hitler was obsessed with oil and
3483280	3490560	homo sapiens historically have gone to war when there are resource or geographical limits
3490560	3495360	could you imagine fighting a war a kinetic war on renewable energy
3496320	3506000	no not the same way i mean i think that i think that there is a difference between
3508880	3517920	the geopolitical ramifications of the arbitrary distribution either under the earth's surface
3518080	3525600	or under the earth's waters of oil and gas then there is of metals which is what is obviously
3525600	3537120	an issue in low carbon energy leaving the uranium question aside on on on nuclear and
3540400	3543680	at a certain point i mean people who are
3548720	3555120	engineers uh where we engineers is perhaps not the right word but there are people who know a
3555120	3562080	lot more about metals they just put it that way then than i do and it's not difficult i think
3562080	3571200	there to imagine that at a certain point that it will be possible to recycle the metals that are
3571200	3580320	necessary for the energy transition and that it is also possible that it will be possible to
3581360	3589600	innovate technologically and find ways to do what are presently being done done let's say by like
3589600	3595760	lithium in relation to batteries in different ways now energies we both know now isn't like that
3596720	3603760	you extract oil or gas and you get to use it once
3606880	3612480	and i think that that makes a like that is quite a fundamental difference between where we might be
3612480	3621280	going geopolitically with the um now that isn't to say that i'm somebody who is really like gong
3621280	3631920	how optimistic about the energy transition but i'm not at least yet convinced that the the geopolitics
3631920	3641440	of metals has to be quite as dangerous and fraught as the geopolitics of oil and gas and
3641440	3650560	particularly oil were in the 20th century so your summary comments there are that we're going to need
3650560	3660000	a lot of metals and materials in order to decarbonize but that rematerialization won't have the same
3660000	3666720	geopolitical constraints of those nations that happen to live where there were ancient oceans
3667360	3672720	and therefore hydrocarbons were buried but let me ask a subset of that which is
3673520	3683120	is the global cooperation and the geopolitics such that with this George Floyd moment in the Middle
3683120	3693760	East and the anti-colonialist kind of simmering up around the world will the global north and west
3693760	3702640	be able to forge agreements in african nations and in southeast asia where a lot of these
3703200	3712800	metals reside is is there still the the political economy that existed 50 years ago to scale that
3713840	3720880	is that a constraint yeah i mean that's the point where i'm much more pessimistic i think it's a
3720880	3731280	particular problem for european countries um both because european countries are significantly
3732080	3740720	more resource poor than the united states they're also largely quite densely populated there's
3740720	3749120	going to be much more resistance to domestic exploration for mining in european countries
3749120	3753760	and i think that ultimately will be in the united states i'm not saying there won't be but i i just
3753760	3759920	think in europe it's a really made proof to be a really hard constraint on exploring those domestic
3759920	3768560	possibilities and then for the european countries they're going back to try and cultivate private
3768560	3777360	sector investment backed by state support often in parts of the world that they once colonized
3778320	3787760	where people have got long memories about europeans and resource extraction in those countries
3788720	3798480	and i think you can see that in what was happening in west africa just over the course of the summer
3799280	3805200	niger in particular where france had been getting a quarter of its uranium
3807280	3815680	from there was a coup the language of this is partly bound up i think with a certain kind of
3815680	3824560	resource nationalism and i think that is going to be the the norm for western countries and
3824640	3831920	particularly european ones in trying to cultivate relationships economic relationships in places
3832480	3839920	that are metal rich and it's going to be even harder when actually european well it's not here
3839920	3844880	it's just actually everybody western countries are saying look we're going to do the energy
3844880	3850080	transition while we've got to keep our fossil fuel energy system going we're going to use that
3850080	3858080	basically as our insurance policy but you can't do that you've got to jump straight into this energy
3858080	3862960	future that we don't really trust is quite right coming and we're going to make it a condition
3862960	3869200	of us doing things that might help you with the energy transition and facilitate our investments
3869200	3876960	in your metal supply chains by with conditional demands that you don't build new pipelines so
3877760	3886320	oil pipelines or like gas pipelines or you don't build new coal fired power stations and i just
3886320	3891600	think that that that that's just like politically just not it's not going to work at all and i think
3891600	3896960	that everything that happened last year in terms of russia's invasion of ukraine and the european
3896960	3902800	reaction to that which was when there was a difficulty european countries including britain
3902800	3910160	which was hardly the most exposed where russian gas was concerned went back to keeping coal fired
3910160	3915680	power stations that were due to close open and they did this in the british case like just
3915680	3921520	months after they'd been caught by glasgow lecturing the chinese and the indians and indonesians
3921520	3928800	about how they had to make commitments to phase out coal by 2045 and what they showed was britain
3928800	3934400	and others european countries was in the emergency where electricity was concerned coal was the energy
3934400	3940160	source of like last resort so why should anybody listen so anything european countries have got
3940160	3945920	to say about phasing out coal when they've when when they've seen that and i think you can hear
3945920	3950800	quite a number of like indian diplomats or indian ministers say things that make pretty clear well
3950800	3955440	your hypocrisy was exposed really very very clearly we're just not we were not really interested in
3955440	3962960	listening to what you've got to say and right now as we speak india is bursting through all time
3963680	3972000	coal production in that nation and the world for that matter yeah yeah um so let's move to the united
3972000	3980160	states uh i knew that i would be running out of time with you um and we're we're halfway through
3980240	3988000	the the time period that i i promised um because you know there's horizontal and and deep vertical
3988000	3996640	complexity on this entire situation um there's geopolitics uh there's history uh there's energy
3996640	4002000	and then there's there's money which we haven't talked about so a large part of the united states
4002000	4008800	geopolitical strength in the mid 20th century came from dominance in energy markets and then we had
4008800	4017840	the conventional peak of us crude in 1970 followed by uh nixon eliminating the gold standard and from
4017840	4025680	that period on much of the u.s geopolitical power has come from a huge expansion of dollar
4025680	4031920	denominated debt predominantly uh and developing nations in combination with the petrodollar to
4031920	4038320	support the largest military in the world uh is this source of strength from dollar denominated
4038320	4047440	debt strong enough to hold the geopolitical sway that the u.s is used to even if the dollar were
4047440	4052400	to become unlinked from the purchase of oil in effect a decline of the the petrodollar
4054880	4061680	i i think this is a really important question night i think if we go back to the the 70s
4061920	4069200	and we say why didn't american power unravel more than it did in the 70s because obviously
4069200	4078720	in significant ways militarily it really did unravel in the in the the 1970s i think the moves
4078720	4086640	towards financial liberalization and the ability to reconstruct a new dollar system after dollar
4087520	4092000	gold convertibility been ended by nixon and after the fixed exchange rate regime had come
4092000	4099840	to an end uh in march 1973 that is absolutely like central to that and if you push that thought
4099840	4107600	a little bit further and said like why didn't the world that was imagined by some in what now
4107600	4114640	gets called the global south uh of commodity exporters becoming more powerful commodity
4114640	4121040	importers falling down the hierarchy so to speak i think a significant part of the answer
4121600	4128000	is because finance became much more uh central to the way in which the the world economy
4129040	4135840	worked and the united states was able as you said to basically have world economy on the
4135840	4142720	debt side credit side run through dollar debt it was able to pay for
4145360	4151760	its own imports of oil in its own currency which was a luxury that that nobody else had the
4151760	4158320	buddhist had it for a while and got them in a way like through the the 60s but in the 70s they
4158400	4164720	into need well until the north sea oil started but they end up with a dollar buying buying
4165680	4174000	oil in dollar problem indeed just on that i mean the french in the 1980s described the strength
4174000	4184000	of the dollar after the vulgar shock as a third oil price shock so that there's lots of things
4184000	4190320	that privileged the united states still about that world that emerges out the world economy that
4190320	4200080	merges out of the um the 1970s now i think there's an absolutely no doubt whatsoever that that some
4200080	4206480	of the large oil imports is obviously starting with china would like nothing more than to be able
4206480	4214000	to be done with the dollar when it comes to buying oil imports and gas imports for that
4214000	4219760	matter um too i mean china has enough problems it's generated by its foreign and oil gas dependency
4219760	4227600	without having to deal with the need to pay for this uh in dollars on on on on top of um or else
4228400	4234000	but i think it's not so clear yet that that's really a very attractive proposition to the
4234080	4240560	sellers and certainly where Saudi Arabia um is um concerned because Saudi Arabia became
4241120	4247200	deeply integrated itself into that dollar world the post 19 the post gold dollar world let's call
4247200	4255200	it that that emerged in the in in the 70s it's willingness to buy um american um debt and i
4255200	4262320	think then what has happened since 2008 really actually since 2007 since the first bit of the
4262320	4268960	financial crash in august of 2007 is in terms of dollar credit um the position of the united
4268960	4272960	states and the federal reserve in particular they've become significantly more important
4273840	4279280	since then than they even than they were um before and that china is much more vulnerable
4280400	4286560	to the fed's monetary decision making to crises of confidence in the euro dollar system than it
4286800	4294640	was pre um 2008 because it was less involved in it so is is that i think now that the the euro
4294640	4302000	dollar system and and and dollar um dollar debt is actually probably more important than ever
4303280	4308960	in some respects at least and whatever the incentives to get out of the system which are
4308960	4315520	overwhelming from the point of view of of china the actual ability to do so is the actual capacity
4315520	4322720	to do that is is much harder than it would seem i think so there might be a desire to get off of
4322720	4329280	the dollar as the world's reserve currency um and the way that countries have to buy oil but the
4329280	4334000	mechanics of doing that i mean the dollar has lots of problems but it's better than all the
4334000	4340960	alternatives let me ask you this yeah no no go on well i this is kind of a meta question but
4341440	4348320	what really underpins the strength and ubiquity and confidence in the u.s dollar
4348320	4354160	is it the productivity and the size of the economy or that we're 90 plus percent energy
4354160	4360160	independent or is it really the military and if it's the military we're printing more dollars and
4360160	4366480	going further into debt a trillion dollars every couple months to pay for the military and everything
4366480	4373600	else there's this like uh unraveling there of of of how it was all put together what do you think
4373600	4382000	about that i mean i i i think that this is a is is a quite hard question to unpack all the different
4382000	4388720	ways in which dollar strength works but my instinct is that actually it's the way the
4388720	4396000	international banking system works that's actually the most important thing now about
4396000	4405520	the dollar's position um and i think you can see that in the ways in which the united states
4405520	4412960	has under the last few presidents pretty much like all of them being able to use other countries
4412960	4420480	companies access to the american banking system to basically make various bits of foreign policy
4420480	4427360	work so if you say like why would they be able to bring the europeans in line on the sanctions
4427360	4436880	against iran both in terms of obama's initial policy of getting around to the negotiating table
4437520	4444800	and then in terms of after trump ended the iran nuclear agreement it's because it's just too
4444880	4453120	difficult for anyone's companies to be shut out of the american banking system now again
4455280	4464560	the willingness to use that weapon incentivizes resistance to it because who wants to be constrained
4464560	4471600	by american foreign policy if they can not be but actually finding ways out i mean the european
4471600	4480320	as i understand it anyway the european countries tried quite hard to find ways of still being able to
4482000	4488880	make financial transactions with iran after 2018 and found it really pretty much impossible to do so
4489520	4496720	so let's move to russia and the ukraine since we're doing a whirlwind tour of international
4496720	4504080	political economy so russia's invasion in ukraine despite the tragedy there nicely timed for your
4504080	4511360	book release had profound energy price and security implications for europe as well as other parts of
4511360	4519680	the world so putin my colleague art burman said on a podcast has a a degree in economics focused on
4519680	4525440	energy and there are some people believe it was this ghost written or plagiarized but still he
4525440	4532000	seems to know a lot more about energy than most of his western counterparts so how much of this
4532000	4540320	ukraine invasion in february of 2022 was about energy versus just a territorial play and how
4540320	4548480	did his earlier campaign and Crimea fit into this strategy i think that you can't begin to understand
4548480	4555040	relations between russia and post independence ukraine so going back to december of 1991
4555600	4563600	without making energy quite central to that and a significant part of that is obviously the pipelines
4564240	4571600	that ran through ukraine or run through ukraine i should say both oil and gas right so from the
4571600	4578720	point of view of russia the disillusion of the soviet union and the independence of ukraine was
4578720	4586400	a complete strategic disaster where energy was concerned because at that point in the 90s all its
4587120	4594800	oil and gas markets go westwards and the pipelines now go through an independent
4595600	4603760	state with which it's got historically extremely complicated and so then i think you can say is
4603760	4613520	is that putin from relatively early from when he came into power kind of worked quite systematically
4613520	4621200	to try to change that on terms of european markets and that was really not just what the
4621200	4627040	Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were about but his moves to build more pipelines under
4627040	4634480	the black sea and he wanted to be able to weaken ukraine by shutting it out of russia's transit
4634480	4642400	system and indeed from his point of view eliminate the risk that ukraine posed to the reliability
4642400	4649440	of russia as an energy exporter i think if you then go to the Crimea crisis you can see that he
4649440	4656560	even with Yanukovych he was supposedly russia friendly in office is Yanukovych had been making
4656560	4662320	deals with various of the western oil companies including for exploration under the for the exploration
4662320	4669440	under the the black sea and by taking control of Crimea and proving russia's position in the black
4669440	4677520	sea the direct control of savastopol there was a certain energy logic to that too i think if you
4677520	4686400	then go though to the events of february of 2022 and say is energy an explanation of this move this is
4686400	4691520	where i think it's a lot harder to say that there was an energy motive that doesn't mean to say that
4691520	4701440	there aren't resource energy resources that issue particularly in the in the Donbas and that that
4701440	4706640	was the area or part of the area anyway where there were some prospects of ukrainian shale
4706640	4713840	though i should say you shale gas that is that by the time that even by the time that the Crimea
4713840	4719440	had happened the annexation of Crimea had happened it was already clear that the shale in poland which
4719440	4726240	had been particularly hyped up as possibly the equivalent to the united states turned out not
4726240	4732480	to be like that the rocks didn't fracture like in the same way so it may be that ukrainian shale
4732480	4739440	was always a dead end but he kind of brought that to an end by the moves in 2014 but i struggled to
4739440	4746400	see really an energy motive for what happened last year i think that's much more about a
4746400	4754560	basic rejection of ukraine as an independent nation state and some concern about the growth
4754560	4762320	of nato power around the black sea do you think putin imagined or predicted or believed that he
4762320	4768960	would lose europe as a gas market when he invaded ukraine i think this is hard i think you can see
4768960	4777360	that he tried to put some pressure on the european governments in the latter months of 2021 so there
4777360	4783360	was some reduced supply through various of the pipelines going on often sort of presented as
4783360	4788960	being for technical reasons but i think it's probably better seen as kind of like warnings
4789680	4798080	that i could i could do a lot inflict a lot more harm on you um than um this
4800000	4809200	i think that the thing where you can say that he may have misread the signals quite a bit
4809840	4816400	is actually on Nord Stream 2 encouraged really by the biden administration which would
4817120	4825600	move the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 about six i think it was it was at a may or june of 2021
4826160	4831680	so from that point of view i mean the germans who've basically been fighting a rearguard
4831680	4837520	action trying to defend Nord Stream 2 ever since the annexation of crime area sorry the year after
4837520	4845200	so 2015 when they made the agreement to build Nord Stream 2 must have looked like well we've
4845200	4850800	held on despite all that american pressure we've been vindicated we've got our pipeline we won't
4850800	4858560	be dependent on that unreliable supply coming through ukraine for very much longer and i could
4858560	4866720	see that putin could have thought the germans aren't going to give up on this just at the point when
4866720	4873440	they've got what they've been secured what they've invested spent a lot of political credibility
4874080	4880640	um on but i think he just misjudged really quite profoundly how difficult it would be
4880640	4886720	for a german government to legitimate the energy relationship with russia in the context of all
4886720	4893200	our war against ukraine i just think that that was such a shock in germany that for germany to then
4893680	4897360	carry on with the status quo now in lots of ways i think they carried on with the status quo more
4897360	4904080	than it seems but they had rhetorically to impudiate that relationship and i think perhaps he didn't
4904080	4912560	really understand that how did europe become so dependent on russian oil and natural gas and given
4912640	4921760	your knowledge of history and the world wars in the 20th century based on oil
4922400	4930720	and coal underpinning the first industrial economies led by the uk and and and germany
4931520	4938000	is this going to be the beginning of a phase of deindustrialization because of what's happening
4938000	4944160	in europe i mean i i think the answer from um germany's point of view which i think is the
4944160	4952080	the crucial european country where this russian energy relationship is um concern that in the age
4952080	4958800	of oil that russia whether it was russia or whether it was the soviet union whether it's back to
4958800	4963760	russia again is the most obvious
4966560	4974800	oil relationship for germany to have if you think of it as there being three big blocks the americas
4976480	4987920	the middle east and russia just geography alone would align germany in russia's direction
4987920	4994480	and then if you think about it um historically the periods of aberration
4996640	5003360	until what's happened in the last year were the period when hitler went from the nazi
5003360	5014880	soviet pact to outright conquest and then the period between well the first 15 years or so of
5014880	5024240	the cold war when west germany wasn't buying oil from the soviet union so in one sense you could
5024240	5030000	put the question the other way around is like let's explain why those ones were the way that they
5031200	5040000	were if you look at it then in terms of post war history so why did that period of the
5040000	5046080	early cold war come to an end the beginning of the answer for west germany is the serious crisis
5047600	5054880	because aden hara the conrad aden hara the west german chancellor at the time he was utterly
5054880	5060400	appalled by what eisen hara did he went off to paris to see the french prime minister guy
5061360	5067440	moley he was there i believe when eden rang moley to tell him that they were going to have to
5068400	5072480	pull out and aden hara said europe will be your revenge
5074480	5082480	meaning the creation of the european economic community but in practical terms is they began
5082480	5087920	which had already been started by italian oil company further discussions with the soviet
5087920	5094160	regime about buying oil from the the the soviet union now the americans put sufficient pressure
5094160	5099600	on west germany to make that really difficult again use of extraterritorial pressure of
5099600	5108560	extraterritorial sanctions so actually west germany was quite late of the european countries
5108560	5112960	or put it this way it wasn't the first of the european countries to either get soviet oil
5112960	5119360	or later to make gas agreements but once the taboo in cold war terms are being lifted which
5119360	5124560	it really was by the johnson administration in the united states then i think west germany went
5124560	5131840	back to what is the more geographically obvious thing for it to do which is to have a energy
5131840	5138720	relationship with what was then the the soviet union the the big problem for germany in the
5138720	5143440	post cold war world was really this ukrain issue in this sense germany and russia were in the same
5143520	5151360	place about this because they the germans didn't want to be dependent for their energy supply on a
5151360	5159520	ukrainian economically christian ridden country for a lot of the time in the post independence period
5159520	5167200	where at times of difficulty there was siphoning off of the gas coming through the pipelines
5167840	5173520	in terms of the conflicts about pricing between russia and ukraine and and that germany would take
5174320	5180320	an energy security hit for the nature of the russia ukraine relationship far better logically
5180320	5184880	from its point of view to have a pipeline that went under the Baltic sea or two pipelines that
5184880	5190000	went under the Baltic sea and bypassed russia so bypass ukraine and allowed for direct russia
5190000	5196400	relationship but but now that's ancient history so now they're dependent on middle eastern
5196400	5202080	lng and stuff from all over the world but now the middle east is in crisis too so that adds
5202080	5211040	further risk to future energy imports for for europe now completely i mean you you can see that this
5212880	5220960	this nightmare in terms of like which poison do you pick here continues to you have three european
5221040	5227200	countries in the space of the last three months that have signed long term 20 year plus 27 year
5227200	5234800	plus i think in each case lng agreements with katar the dutch the italians and the french
5235760	5244240	and katar as we know is the at least as important sponsor in a way of of hamas as iran
5244960	5254640	is and that would be if there is a if there's an equivalent of the arab oil embargo on the
5254640	5264960	us and the netherlands back in 19 october 73 to march 74 it would be katar embargoing the sale of
5266880	5271760	liquid natural gas to european countries including britain with who've with with which it's had
5272640	5276080	long-term contracts for quite a while if that were to happen i mean that would be
5276080	5282720	a cataclysmic event for the world economy and for europe yeah and this goes back to the question
5282720	5286320	that we came up that you asked and i don't think i answered about the prospects for
5286960	5292240	deindustrialization essentially in germany and i think that that is real i mean maybe
5292240	5301520	deindustrialization is you know too hyperbolic but we can see that the german industrial economy
5302080	5310160	benefited very much from cheap relatively cheap pipeline gas from russia take that away
5311920	5317600	germany has to import significantly more expensive liquid natural gas from a starting
5317680	5322480	place in which it had no liquid natural gas ports let alone any literally long-term liquid
5322480	5329040	natural gas contracts it had to be bought in the in the spot market you can see all kinds of
5329040	5333680	industrial production that was heavily gas dependent closed down during the course of
5334400	5338720	last winter that's one of the reasons why european countries got through last winter
5338720	5344720	without more problems where gas supply is concerned because there was you know demand
5344720	5353840	destruction in the industrial sector particularly in germany if you then were to have katar being
5353840	5359200	willing to use a gas weapon against european countries after they've already taken it from
5359200	5364240	russia because we should remember it wasn't european countries that stopped buying pipeline gas
5364240	5375200	from Nord Stream 1 it was russia that effectively embargoed the sale of that gas is katar politically
5375200	5384000	and diplomatically friendly with iran i mean i think that that's that's not an entirely
5384000	5391920	straightforward relationship either what is true is is that unlike the arab other arab states
5392640	5400080	they have shared gas interests with iran though those two countries have massive amounts of natural
5400080	5407200	gas yeah i mean it's because they're basically it's like one big gas field with a katar side and a
5407200	5414400	iranian side to it so where where does the uk your country stand in all this your well past peak
5414400	5420800	in your domestic energy production but like the usa you're also a financial and a military hub
5422080	5430000	so is the multipolar world the united states the uk and then a few satellites that that need our
5430000	5435440	military and energy support or where does the uk stand in all of this well i think one of the
5435440	5442240	things that's really interesting if you look at long history uh and look for the patterns like
5442240	5450560	over time um is britain withdrew from east of syria so it ended as i said earlier
5451680	5458960	it's imperial presence um a military presence in the middle east um in 1971 announced that in january
5458960	5467440	of 1968 it did the buddhist navy did have some presence around the persian gulf by the end of
5467440	5474320	the decade but nothing like the scale of the americans um then we have the period from late
5474320	5482480	70s through the 80s into the into the 90s uh of um domestic oil production being quite high
5482480	5492080	via the uh north sea and then since i think it's 2004 um buddhants basically become a net energy
5492080	5497120	importer again so we're quite some time now we're nearly two decades into britain being back to
5497120	5505200	being a net energy importer and what you can see in the 2010s under the david camberans
5506400	5512000	government is that a reorientation back to the middle east you might even say that britain
5512000	5518800	has come back east of syria again 2015 announced there'd be a new naval base in like borrain
5519600	5527360	clearly um cultivating um relations with the united arab emirates which is an important
5527360	5533840	investor uh in the uk and i think that the finance is i think it was actually another agreement
5533840	5540000	with the united arab emirates just like a couple of weeks ago a new investment um agreement sort
5540000	5546400	of tied to energy transition too but the gulf that the britain is going back to where it's been
5546400	5550720	because it's gone back into the middle east because it's still got that historical relationship
5550720	5557840	particularly with those with those smaller um gulf states because it's become much more dependent
5557840	5564400	back on that part of the world post north sea oil so when i talk to you helen it's like a positive
5564400	5571360	feedback dynamic that i don't have fewer questions i have more questions um let me ask you a couple
5571360	5579600	really hard questions about the middle east so if israel pursues the brass ring moment of
5580320	5586080	evicting palestinian populations from gaza and the west bank possibly
5587280	5593200	is it possible that arab governments collectively will have to respond to that and what would be
5593200	5600800	the implications i think that arab governments would have to like respond to that um but i think
5600880	5611120	that that very fact and the fact that the israelis need to find a way of dealing with or they have
5611120	5616320	to have some kind of plan for what happens in gaza once the military action is over i mean that they
5616320	5625360	can't alienate arab states like that and cause them that kind of um difficulty i mean i think in
5625360	5633920	this respect we really need to like understand just like what a colossal problem is well now
5633920	5642000	faces after what has happened because the status quo any version of the status quo of the the
5642000	5647680	previous day before the 7th of um october is completely gone i mean they're basically under
5647680	5662160	netanaryu treated hamas as uh a quasi partner even though it goes far as saying for isolating the
5662160	5669840	gaza problem from israel and then relying on the technology of the wall and the iron dome to deal
5669840	5680240	with any potential security threat from hamas so let hamas rule um gaza let it be the case that
5680240	5686160	because they're hamas you can't engage with a question about a palestinian state we defend
5686160	5691120	ourselves with technology and it's all come crashing like down around them but when all said
5691120	5697920	and done whenever they do militarily somebody's going to have to take responsibility for gaza
5697920	5702480	for them because i cannot believe that they're going to go back in there either and expel the
5702480	5707520	entire population because the united states won't let them do that um or thing that they can rule it
5707520	5713040	directly themselves they need arab help in order to do that some by some means or another
5714240	5721280	okay this is a crazy question to ask uh and i know you're not a religious scholar um a political
5721280	5728320	scholar but how much do end time prophecies around various religious groups play into
5728320	5736000	this situation specifically israel's claim to rebuild the third temple and muslim and evangelical
5736000	5742720	christians and mormons saying that such event would trigger the return of christ i've heard this
5743040	5749360	all pined in the recent week i mean i actually am interest very interested in religious questions
5750160	5756320	but i mean i i don't even know really begin to begin to know how to answer that um question i mean
5756320	5764960	all i would say is this is that i think that one of the conceptual failures let's call it that um
5764960	5771360	of the way in which the israeli government under net and r u dealt with hamas was an inability to see
5771360	5781840	its millenarian fundamentally millenarian tendencies uh and that millenarian what is that
5781840	5790960	meaning like the the end times okay yeah justify any kind of like destruction in order to bring
5790960	5798480	like the new world right um about and i i i think that they didn't understand that aspect
5798480	5800880	they turned a blind eye to that aspect of hamas
5804000	5811280	so how how are let's let's bring it down to a a fine point here with everything going on
5812240	5822240	china russia the us debts hamas israel energy depletion we haven't talked much about climate
5822240	5828800	change um but as geopolitical tension increases across these different power nodes globally
5829760	5838080	i think energy insecurity for a number of nations will increasingly uh be um politically very
5838080	5845360	important do you think that this is going to push nations towards green energy aspirations
5845360	5853120	or uh in contrast to our resurgence of coal use or maybe we're going to have to learn to cope with
5853120	5860160	a lower energy lifestyle which we've seen some previews with uh last year in in europe uh what
5860160	5867120	do you what do you think about all that i think that there's no doubt you can see this clearly
5867120	5877120	in europe that energy insecurity driven by geopolitics increased the desire to speed up
5877120	5882080	the energy transition but nothing that happened in europe last year in that respect changed the
5882080	5887840	difficulties facing the energy transition indeed you could argue and i would argue that they increased
5887840	5893200	the difficulties because they made the monetary and financial environment in which it has to happen
5893200	5900480	harder than was previously the case because they intensified what were already the growing pressures
5901280	5906880	on energy um inflation so
5911120	5917920	you can try and speed things up but desires say isn't going isn't going to do that i find it hard to see
5918880	5926080	a world over the next five years let's say certainly five to ten years where there isn't
5926080	5933440	going to be a politics of reduced energy consumption i think the politicians in western countries will
5933440	5943680	try very very hard to avoid that they will keep looking for fixes that aren't really there to deal
5943680	5951920	with these problems to you know kick the can down the road some more but um
5955120	5961920	there are just a whole set and i think we would agree about this of systemic energy
5961920	5969520	difficulties across the different energy sources they interact with each other in
5969520	5977360	quite dysfunctional um ways and there is of some kind going to be some kind of reckoning with that
5977360	5987440	i don't know i i i know enough to understand that making predictions about when those dynamics are
5987440	5993680	going to play themselves out all the form in which they're going to take it is is is very very difficult
5993840	6001040	um because there are so many contingencies particularly actually on the on the on the
6001040	6010640	geopolitical side that can derail what seem to be passive development at any any any one time
6010640	6013840	and it's a it's a strange and this is why i think it's hard to think about because on the one hand
6013840	6018720	it's it is systemic but on the other hand it is vulnerable to contingent events
6018960	6026480	well it's been forestalled by debt writ large um around the world um i i want to be respectful
6026480	6034160	of of your evening um well let me ask you a few more questions um you're an energy scholar and a
6034160	6042960	historian uh given everything you just outlined for me what would be a couple of uh unofficial
6043200	6049280	unofficial pieces of advice you would have to the leaders on Downing Street or in in your
6049280	6059760	country ahead of um probably um reduced energy use you said earlier the political uh um football
6059760	6065680	of energy and using less in the uk is probably in not too distant future do you have any thoughts
6065680	6073840	of recommendations i mean the the thing that frustrates me um in terms of what i see in in
6073840	6081600	britain and i wouldn't go any further than that in this respect is that i don't see much evidence the
6081600	6092720	politicians think about energy across the board yeah i think they have bits of energy policy
6092720	6100240	here and there some of it perhaps better thought out than others but i don't think
6100240	6108400	that they see the ways in which all these different problems interact with each other
6108400	6113360	and all the way in which that they interact with the monetary environment in a way i think they've
6113360	6121600	got better understanding the geopolitics perhaps in the last year to some extent um anyway i think
6121680	6129680	that is it possible that they could could they be educated uh or is this systemic story that
6129680	6134640	you and i are painting almost like impossible for an elected official to integrate
6138400	6142240	i think this is a really interesting question because i think in the past the politicians
6142240	6151120	have actually understood this quite well in western countries so i think that energy blindness to
6151120	6161440	use your language now has got a history to it it's not just a like static conceptual failure
6162960	6169520	it's things happen at some point in let's say we're gonna this you know 80s 90s whenever
6169520	6179760	it whenever uh it is some i think um understanding that was sort of passed generationally down at
6179760	6184800	least top-level politicians and officials that say in civil servants like in britain
6184800	6193440	somewhere got lost that is my i don't have a uh i really worked out history of that but
6193440	6200640	i have a strong sense that that general picture that i just said there um is um true so in principle
6201440	6208160	i can't see any reason why today's politicians today's officials can't understand the kind of
6208160	6213360	things in which we've been talking about indeed quite the contrary i mean i'd just say look at
6213360	6220000	myself you know 10 10 years ago when i started things so you know this is literally 10 2013
6220000	6225760	i couldn't be gone so i've had this conversation that we've been having now for like the best part
6225760	6232400	like of two hours most of this is like self education over a decade because i understood
6232400	6238080	enough back in 2013 to think i really really should try to understand this because i think it's
6238080	6245760	going to shape the world in which we all live for some time to come now i see no reason that i
6246560	6250720	can educate myself to do that i take it from your story you've done that at some point too
6250720	6256400	that other people who in positions of power can't do this as well well the differences they are playing
6256400	6262800	whack-a-mole every day and they have 15 minute uh time spans let me ask you this so you're an
6262800	6269840	energy scholar uh and a teacher i was a professor but only a teacher really how much time do you
6269840	6278080	spend uh helen every week reading uh or listening to podcasts or educating yourself on on the world
6278080	6286960	or the world's history i mean i try to yeah i i try to spend quite a reasonable amount of time
6286960	6297200	each um week uh i'm also like uh very busy uh as an academic uh i teach quite a lot i enjoy
6297200	6304080	teaching um quite a lot so some weeks that i do better than others and sometimes like a few months
6304080	6308560	will go by and then i'll see something and think god i should have understood that like at least
6308560	6315360	six weeks ago and i've missed something like quite significant and and then you here dive into it to
6315360	6322320	and then i dive into it and try it yeah and then so i i'm i learn a lot on the run to be honest i mean
6323840	6331200	that's part of the nature of the world in which we live me too so so like me you are an analyst
6331200	6337840	that sees all this unfolding but we're kind of observing it like we're watching a movie and we're
6337840	6346960	explaining it but we're also living it helen um so how do you personally cope with learning about
6346960	6356160	the energy geopolitical financial crisis that we're facing and then living and this is your life
6356160	6361520	and our life that that we're a part of that how do you compartmentalize or how do you manage that
6362720	6370800	that's a good question i um there are times and to be honest it's usually like at night
6373440	6383280	when i just think this is this is a world of like such such danger uh it's quite terrifying
6384240	6391600	um my day mind is generally a lot better at coping and that was because you're surrounded by bright
6391600	6399280	smiling curious young humans and uh nice buildings and lots of books and food and such night mind
6399280	6408080	yeah but i i mean i'm a quite a fan of lord of the rings me too and um i say to myself and i say
6408800	6413360	i say this to my niece sometimes that i like that bit when gandalf's trying to explain to
6415200	6422480	frodo why when frodo says i wish it hadn't happened in my time and gandalf says basically so do i so
6422480	6429680	does everyone who gets to live in such a time but we don't get to choose when we um live we just
6429680	6434960	get to choose what to do with our time we just get to choose what to do with our time and i think
6434960	6442960	that is probably kind of the way that i do try and live in um this respect and i find for myself
6442960	6450480	i'm not saying this would be true for everybody that i find that trying to live open-eyed and trying
6450480	6460800	to cultivate inner resilience that that is better for me than living with denial well i think that
6460800	6467760	is true for many of us and many of the people listening to this podcast um and building on that
6467760	6474960	do you have recommendations for those listening who agree with your overview and synthesis uh
6475760	6483040	and kind of foresight of how things might if you squint uh your your picture will hold together in
6483040	6492640	coming decades do you have advice uh for listeners i mean i'm always very uh cautious about um
6493520	6500240	advice i mean because i just kind of think um it's hard enough for me to like get to
6500240	6512960	grit with advice in myself um i mean i think that you know the the the qualities that um are needed
6512960	6519200	for the times in which we live well the the quality perhaps is resilience and then we have to cultivate
6519200	6526720	that in our cells and sometimes that is going to mean changing um that i think particularly like
6527520	6532480	in western countries those of us who've been incredibly privileged in so many um
6533200	6536720	ways certainly those of us who live absolute lives in western countries because obviously there are
6536720	6544480	people um who don't the more that we can understand i think the the economic and the geopolitical
6544480	6553680	contingency of the material lives that we have then the easier it is psychologically to to deal with
6554080	6562320	um to deal with what is coming and that i think it though when it goes back you know
6562880	6567920	i think it does matter how we choose to how we choose to live in these times i don't think
6567920	6574560	there's any reason to say that because it's hard and there's so many um difficulties and
6575280	6578720	dangers ahead that that doesn't mean that we can't live our lives well
6579280	6585440	and you're a teacher and i don't know how much uh in those two classes you're currently teaching
6585440	6592560	you get to the depth of what the conversation we just had um but clearly your students are aware
6592560	6598720	of what's going on in the middle east and russia um and ukraine so what do you what advice do you
6598720	6604400	give your students um at the end of the semester and and what advice would you give to young humans
6604400	6613440	listening to this episode i mean i don't tend to like advise um the students i have in the way
6613440	6619920	that the Cambridge system like works i have about 25 students who i have a very direct
6619920	6629200	responsibility for like beyond um teaching um very interested in their lives and i try to engage
6629200	6636560	with them about that i have a strong sense that it really matters what is passed from like one
6636560	6645440	generation to the next i'm very conscious of what my inheritances have been in that um respect
6646400	6651440	and i'm interested i suppose as much in trying to give something back to them in the way in which
6651440	6660560	i think something was like given to me and that they then might like pass on um to i mean i do
6660560	6673760	think i probably encourage them to to try to historicize the moment and to try to uh understand
6673760	6682160	that um human beings have they've lived through some much harder times than even the ones that we
6682160	6689040	get far harder and that they've survived and that the human spirit has like survived through
6689040	6692480	that i mean i think about europe through the the black death
6692960	6706640	century and that there are all kinds of good things in the future we may well not live to see
6706640	6714400	in this um respect but it's never if you look at human history just a story of permanent disaster
6714400	6718720	from which that there is no escape and i'm not saying that because i want to minimize any of
6718720	6727440	the catastrophes in the first part of the 20th century which quite quite um the contrary um
6727440	6732000	but we don't have to well our own lives are concerned i don't think we don't have to be fatalistic
6733760	6742640	yep i agree let me ask you this it's my belief um that there's around 240 million college students
6742640	6750000	in the world and i think humans in grad school particularly and postdocs are an incredible
6750000	6760080	and underutilized natural resource um that we can have help tackling the systemic overview that
6760080	6767280	that you and i have discussed um but within the current academy which is kind of part of the energy
6767280	6774240	hungry superorganism and linear and business as usual i don't think the creativity is being
6774240	6783440	directed towards its best use so in your field um political economy political science uh energy
6783440	6791840	with an energy lens can you offer a few big questions that uh postdocs uh and such around
6791840	6798880	the world listening to this program could be working on that need uh research and answers but
6798880	6805360	might not be what's conventionally chosen i mean i think there's one here i really would
6806800	6813600	pick and uh for political economy and that is the relationship between monetary history and energy
6814240	6825120	history okay i mean i spent some time in um in disorder trying to think about that in relationship
6825120	6832080	to the end of dollar gold convertibility and in relation to the 2008 crash but the nature of
6832080	6838400	the book meant that i was just scratching like at the surface i actually had an idea of trying
6838400	6845120	to do something more systematically about uh this myself including trying to think about the
6845120	6852960	relationship between the the 1929 crash the end of the the gold standard the interwar gold standard
6852960	6858960	and changes in the energy world particularly the um return of the soviet union as a as an oil
6859760	6868160	export and i think there's there may be something um in that but i think that that gets as well at
6868160	6874800	a question that i think that is really important beyond political economy and in some ways it goes
6874800	6881760	to the heart of like the way in which economics is done academically which is this presumption
6881760	6890320	that actually we understand the economic world via a monetary lens rather than via an energy lens
6890320	6896000	and i think that once you bring the energy lens into political economy a lot of things start to look
6896000	6905760	quite different and so i think um a project which looked at the relationship between monetary
6905760	6909440	history and energy history through the entirety of the 20th century and maybe even going back to the
6909440	6918240	origins of the of the gold standard in the in the in the 1870s would be very would be very revealing
6918240	6927200	and would have some significance beyond just the actual history in terms of trying to bring a more
6928160	6932960	well trying to you know move the dial away from a monetary focus to an energy focus and understanding
6932960	6941840	the economic world okay thank you a couple closing questions helen what do you care most about in the
6941840	6951760	world uh that's that is um that is a non-academic question yeah because it presumes a quite high
6951760	6963440	level of self-awareness that one really knows what one does um care um about uh i mean in a
6963440	6971600	personal sense i i'm i'm passionate about the pursuit of knowledge that's i'm very intellectually
6972400	6984320	curious that drives quite a lot of um of what i do um i'm also um very interested in
6986960	6994160	cultural and spiritual questions i don't think of this uh in terms of being focused on political
6994160	7001280	economy i don't think of that as being at odds with a more spiritual way of thinking about
7001360	7007120	the world i'd rather try and think both materially and um spiritually i mean beyond myself i'd go
7007120	7012400	back in a way to the answer that i gave you know like earlier i mean i care very deeply about what
7012400	7020560	is passed between the generations i feel very that inwardly quite strongly uh in terms of my own
7021120	7027440	personal history but in tools also the fact that you know i've been working in a university as a
7027520	7038240	educator for nearly three decades um now and that i find that it's very uh well it's just
7038240	7041840	rewarding to i was going to say emotionally but that's not actually sufficient it's rewarding to
7041840	7048080	me as a human being to do that and it's very important to me that i continue to do that
7049200	7055680	i fully agree uh i feel the same way and that is uh why i continue to do this podcast because
7055680	7065280	i think education is the single no regret strategy given what we face um to to uh pass the baton to
7065280	7071360	the next generation as you say um if you uh and you i know you listen to my podcast so you know
7071360	7077040	what question i'm i'm about to ask if you had a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to
7077040	7082960	your decision what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures
7082960	7093520	i mean i thought about this quite hard and in one sense the easy answer i think given we're
7093520	7101280	talking about energy would be to say the success of fusion so something that would that that would
7101280	7107120	basically mean the human beings didn't have to think about energy in the same way that they could
7107120	7112560	take it like for for granted but they want to start to think about that i thought well actually
7112560	7119280	nobody's got any idea what it would mean to be a human being under conditions in which
7120800	7129920	energy could just be like taken for granted maybe that just because for a couple of centuries
7129920	7137280	certainly that energy is being fossil fuel energy drove such conflict between states that if we had
7137280	7141280	an abundant energy didn't have to think about it maybe we would just do other find other ways of
7141280	7148000	doing bad things because we wouldn't be constrained by energy so i kind of a little bit more would go
7148000	7155840	with the uh making us all changing or having higher levels of self-awareness a consciousness thing
7155840	7165120	rather than the materials first thing uh more aware of our own um shared humanity more aware
7165120	7174320	less selfish um consciousness more aware of our relationship to the uh to to the to the planet
7174320	7184720	and i don't think obviously that's a fix in um any sense whatsoever um but i think that the
7186880	7192000	world would be would be a better place that's a good wish
7192880	7200640	um to be continued my friend thank you for your scholarship and your teaching and we'll be in touch
