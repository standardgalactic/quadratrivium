0	6880	Joining me today is Kim Stanley Robinson, a very well-known science fiction author.
6880	13280	I've long thought that we need to better communicate science to the general public,
13280	18480	but in a way that uses art and literature to be able to change the mental landscapes
18480	25680	of an individual human mind. Stan has been publishing science fiction novels for almost
25680	33040	40 years now. He's a leading figure in climate fiction writing. Stan incorporates strong influences
33040	39840	of ecological, cultural, and political themes and features scientists as the heroes in his work.
40960	46720	Many of you have heard or read his most recent novel, Ministry for the Future,
46720	52480	which has been highly praised for the illumination of possible near-term climate impacts
52480	61280	and how imagining such an issue might change our responses to what we face. How can we incorporate
61280	67840	fiction into our set of tools to bring more people into awareness of the pressing system dynamics that
67840	76320	underpin global human events? This was a very interesting conversation. I hope you enjoyed it.
76320	78880	Please welcome Kim Stanley Robinson.
90480	93920	Hello, Stan. Hey there, Nate. Great to see you.
95040	101760	Yes, good to see you too. So you, let's dive right into it. I've long known of your name,
101760	107840	because I've read some of your books long ago, but you've kind of been thrust into a broader
107840	115200	spotlight because of our cultural awareness of climate change and your recent very popular book
115200	122160	Ministry for the Future, which kind of took a view in the future of accelerating climate damage
122800	129680	to society. You've long been an environmentalist. How did you decide that fiction writing was the
129680	133520	way that you wanted to get involved and contribute to these issues?
135440	143520	Well, for me, the fiction writing came first. So the environmentalism came later. I was a
143520	149360	reader as a kid. I grew up in a suburbia in Southern California. I was a beach kid. I did love the
149360	156160	beach with all my heart, but I didn't think of it as anything but getting out of suburbia into
156160	164800	something more fun. And then I was an English major. I loved all literature, but the novel sort
164800	171040	of takes precedence in my reading life and in the world at large these days when it comes to
171040	177760	literature, maybe not compared to screenplays. Anyway, I got into science fiction because it
177760	184400	seemed like the best way of conveying the way my reality felt, which was Southern California
184400	190400	turning from orange grows into city extremely rapidly. And so science fiction struck a chord
190400	199200	with me and I wrote it. That's my start. And then I started going to this year in Nevada when I was
199200	208320	an undergraduate in college and that mountain consciousness was pretty all-encompassing. It
208320	215600	reoriented my lowland life to be always thinking about the mountains, my love of the mountains.
215600	221920	What did that mean? What were the threats involved? And I began to notice that California in general
221920	230720	is what you could seriously call a terraformed space. The waters distributed by unnatural means.
230720	239200	It's an irrigated landscape. It's now urban, but also ag. It made me pay attention. And then
240240	247360	by that time the environmental movement was really an active thing in the world,
247360	254400	pointing out the dangers that even preceded our awareness of climate change. And then climate
254400	261280	change was just the, how can you say it, the exponential growth of an environmental consciousness.
261280	267920	And it began to invade my science fiction. Anytime I set a story in the next 100 years or two or
267920	275760	almost anywhere, the climate and the environment were prominent players in the story. So that's how
275760	283520	it came about for me. And what's been your experience? Have you found your works, your books to be
283520	290880	effective in educating or swaying people? No, not until the ministry for the future.
292000	298240	I can say that my books were considered, oh, well, you know, that's Stan, he's our Boy Scout,
298240	306400	he's our nature guy. Science fiction community likes to be ecumenical and welcoming to
307200	312000	all kinds of viewpoints. And in the great world of the science fiction community,
312000	319120	it's a melting pot where no matter what your politics or your interests, you can be taken in
319120	325040	with open arms. So that was the attitude towards me. And in the larger world, I had my readers.
325040	334000	But and truthfully, I mean, to be more serious about it, as time passed, it became obvious that I was
334960	340720	a leading proponent of climate fiction, which was near future science fiction,
341360	346960	paying attention to the over determining reality of climate change. So in other words,
346960	353520	all nearest future science fiction had to turn into climate fiction to be at all realistic or
353520	361120	relevant. And so it wasn't just the ministry for the future itself, like from zero to 60. But
361120	371200	in a growing sense of where I was in the cultural conversation, and New York 2140 was a big step
371200	377520	in that way with its sea level rise and its climate finance, ministry still nevertheless has
380640	385760	joined the or how can I say it, it's it's blown up my life, but it's joined the world
385760	391200	conversation in a way that none of my books ever have before. So I wonder if you had written that
391200	396480	exact same book 20 years ago, if it would have been far, you know, equally well written, if it
396480	402640	would have been far less well received, just because the public awareness of climate still
402640	409680	wasn't the way it is now where we have events and things that people recognize are out of the normal.
410640	416480	I think that can be a that's almost certainly true. Yes. And we have a small thought experiment
416480	425760	that shows how true it is. I published 40 signs of rain in I think 2004. And I want to say that 40
425760	431520	signs of rain is not as good at novel as ministry for the future. It's it's confined to Washington,
431520	438000	DC to the National Science Foundation. It's an attempt to go local. But because the local was
438000	443520	Washington, DC, that was its supposed international aspect, you know, capital of the world and all
443520	448560	that. But National Science Foundation is not a powerful agency. It was a bit of a joke on my
448560	457920	part. I I struggled to convey Washington, DC, and the federal bureaucracy in a novel. And
457920	464480	my struggles were, I think, evident on the page. But it was also 2004. And this was just an odd
464480	470640	thing to be interested in then. And I must say Al Gore's in In Can Me In Truth came out almost
470640	477360	the same week as my novel. And it did have an impact. So that was partly Al Gore, partly movie,
477360	483280	partly a better demonstration of the severity of the problem than my novel. Nevertheless,
483280	487440	if I had if the if the book I had put out then had been ministry, it wouldn't have gotten the
487440	490320	same attention that it got in 2020.
491760	497680	Just a brief personal question. Did you win like writing awards in your high school English
497680	502560	classes? And were you always like going home and writing short stories and stuff? Or is this
502560	505760	something that evolved into a passion and skill over time?
507520	514320	In high school, I loved Shakespeare and poetry and detective novels. And there weren't any prizes
514320	522000	to be had, except for one, my English teacher, Mrs Catherine Lee, a sweetheart, a complete anglophile,
522000	529200	an elderly woman who seemed of a previous age to us, because I'm talking the late 60s here.
529200	537200	And she was probably had her, her looks and her mind formed in the 1930s. So she's probably
537200	542320	was quite a bit younger than I am now, but we considered her to be ancient. But she was lovely.
542320	548320	She paid attention. She liked it that I like literature. We were like the two literature
548880	554400	lovers in the entirety of Orange County, as far as we could tell. And so she was fond of me.
554400	561440	It's amazing how high school memories like that are imprinted on our amygdala.
562080	567120	My high school English teacher Rita Mack, I specifically can see the pen writing blah,
567680	578560	boring in red ink on some of my papers. So more broadly, with writing and fiction, etc.,
578560	585920	how important do you think art is, broadly speaking, versus science in our current kind
585920	592320	of poly crisis situation? It's a good question and a hard one. And I'm not
592640	600160	good at answering it because I'm kind of inside my own bubble looking out into the world from a
600160	606880	particular perspective. I'd say it's the sciences that are making all the stuff that keep us alive
606880	612720	and telling us how the world works. And this is the science dominated world or science created
612720	621280	world. But then the science at its straightest, where it's really being honest with itself and
621280	629200	with everything else, and notice I'm personifying it, is modest in this way. It says we're learning
629200	634080	about the world. We're creating some power over the world. We're not going to tell you what to do
634080	640720	with it. That's the job of everybody else. And so they give over, many scientists will just say,
640720	646320	look, this is society's job or this is the work for philosophy. And so there the arts and humanities
646320	652640	come in. What do we do with our new powers? How do we get along with each other? These are not
652640	662400	scientific questions. These are humanities questions. And so the arts can come in to tell the story
662400	671440	and to create a sense of meaning. And so that is important. It's vaguer and it's also like a
672000	676960	giant echo chamber that we're all inside where everybody's yammering all at once. So in other
676960	687200	words, it's quite incoherent. But it is important. Well, I would argue that art is more important,
687200	692960	but it has to be informed by the correct system science. And a lot of our, like you said,
693600	699440	everyone's kind of yammering in the same chamber. A core message in ministry of the future is that
699440	706320	civilization has to trust in science. But I wonder what version of science, because economic,
707120	714320	which in my opinion is not a science, is overlaid on top of climate science and gives in my opinion
714320	720480	quite inappropriate roadmaps of the future. In effect, there are no integrated assessment models
720480	726640	that show a decline in growth from today to the year 2100. What do you think of that?
727600	736000	Well, I'm with you on that. I think economics is a quantified ethics or a power politics disguised
736000	742160	as a science. So it's an instrument of power to run some numbers and say, we'll do this because of
742160	748640	these reasons, because it makes economic sense. I would divide it, it is a social science and it
748640	756160	uses scientific tools. It could be more useful than it is. If you think of it as being something like
756240	763520	geometry where there are theorems, but the theorems are decided based on axioms, then economics needs
763520	770640	to go back to the axioms. What are we doing it for? If it's for human welfare and also the welfare
770640	778480	of the rest of the biosphere over the long haul, then those axioms would drive the economic
778480	784960	calculations and we would get different rubrics than profit or shareholder value, which are
784960	791840	ridiculous rubrics, gross domestic product, ridiculous. And even this word you use growth,
791840	799920	when it's used in economics, its meanings are peculiar and various and unhelpful. We need
799920	806240	the poorest people on the planet to live at adequacy, so that's some kind of growth. We don't
806240	812000	need the richest people on the planet to get richer, which I have consistently since the 1980s,
812000	819680	but especially during the pandemic, where something like 70% of the quantitative easing value
819680	825760	created in the pandemic to keep the economy going was captured by the top 2% of wealthy people.
825760	831840	Well, not only that, I often ask what is the carbon footprint of quantitative easing,
831840	837520	something that people don't ask that question. True. Well, this is an economics question that
837520	843920	gets delinked from physical systems questions like you ask, and so economics is ridiculous in
843920	850640	that sense also. It's not rating biosphere impacts, those were used to be negative externalities,
850640	855520	they weren't even included at all. Now they're attempting to include them, but things like the
855520	863680	discount rate or the various wiggles that currently enacted, which is to say legal and powerful
863760	872800	economic systems, they are still very poorly aligned to people and planet. So it is something
872800	877920	that I talk about, and the fact the discussion of it in Ministry for the Future is one of the
877920	884720	reasons that the book has struck people's imagination, that economics could be changed,
884720	888400	that it could be aimed better, that it could be recalibrated, and that it could be
888960	896160	something like the carbon coin, which I would say is a kind of a symbol for power and money being
896880	902640	redirected to the public good and to biosphere health. Well, people were encouraged by that,
902640	906720	they were interested, they were thinking, oh, you know, it's possible to change.
907440	915680	That was one of my few criticisms or not criticisms, but points of interest in ministry
916400	922400	that you wrote about a pro-social, pro-environmental behavior that sequesters carbon would be rewarded
922960	929280	with a carbon coin. But I wondered, in such a society, if you do things and you're rewarded
929280	936000	with a carbon coin, then don't you in turn just go and spend it on other things that create or
936080	946240	contain indirect carbon? Yes, I think that's valid, and it is a problem. I guess I've been
946240	952640	thinking about this since you've communicated with me before this and pondering it, and I guess
952640	962960	I would say the book is a little cautious in that it tries to propose methods we could use
962960	969280	right now that are not completely shocking, that they're legal. You could imagine them getting
969280	977040	passed by central banks and legislatures, and so it's Keynesian. Keynesianism is not radical,
977040	984000	nor is it particularly biosphere friendly. It is a standard economic system where the government
984000	991440	actually stimulates the economy in times of distress, like a depression, and that stimulus is
991440	998560	indeed what you're talking about. More carbon ultimately will be burned. If carbon burning
998560	1005840	is fundamental to the system working, then by keeping it healthy, you're burning more carbon.
1005840	1016400	Yes, but the carbon coin, if it's an adjusted right, then you bring down a ton of CO2 from the
1016400	1025200	atmosphere. Hopefully the creation of the, what can I say, the needs and the wants, the necessities
1025200	1032800	and the toys will be more clean energy created than they were before, so the decarbonization effort
1032800	1039840	would extend to decarbonizing our energy systems, our transport systems. All of those would receive
1039840	1046000	carbon coins, and slowly but surely, even though you might have a quite active and productive
1047280	1052720	society and civilization and economic system, it at least would be decarbonized.
1052720	1057120	It wouldn't solve the other problems, and because there's no single solution here, and indeed my
1057120	1063040	novel talks a lot about biosphere corridors, wildlife corridors. What now is being called the
1063040	1070160	30 by 30 plans, they weren't even quite being discussed when I wrote the book in 2019, and yet
1070160	1074720	now they're the law of the land because of this Montreal Treaty and because of the Ocean Treaty.
1074720	1078880	Well, this is astonishing rapid progress on that front, and that's different than,
1079760	1084480	that's different than economics, that's land use. It has an economic aspect to it, but again,
1084480	1090560	it's part of, it's not exactly decarbonization, except it does draw down carbon if you leave
1090560	1096880	wild land alone, but it's more having to do with biosphere health and having the wild animals
1096880	1101840	not go extinct, so it is a big project. Let me extend that a little bit.
1104880	1110000	I would argue that decarbonization, the way it's being promoted now is going to lead to a
1110000	1118400	rematerialization, especially in the global south, and negative impacts on global ecologies in the
1118400	1125200	countries where there's going to be massive copper and lithium and cobalt mining, etc.
1125200	1132640	So I wonder if you extend the metaphor of the carbon coin in your book to be an ecology coin,
1132640	1139600	things that are not only optimized for climate, but that are optimized for biosphere health,
1139600	1147280	writ large, much wider boundary. I wonder if that would, I mean, part of the problem here
1147280	1153280	is we're trying to optimize so many variables at once, but what do you think about that to
1153360	1160560	extend it to a broader ecology coin? Well, I've certainly heard about this since my book came out
1160560	1167920	in ways that are super interesting. There were people who are studying the fact that you can
1167920	1175760	tell what's alive in a, in a biome, in a watershed by taking a water sample out of its streams and
1175760	1184080	testing for DNA, and those tests have gotten so good and fine-tuned that you can tell everything
1184080	1190080	that is alive in that watershed, and then you get a credit for it. Wait, you can just do a DNA test
1190080	1196960	and it shows the species that live in that watershed? Yes. I didn't know that. Well, it's the ETH,
1196960	1203360	the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, is doing some work on this, and I can put you in
1203440	1209040	contact with the people who are both studying that, and also could that be turned into a form
1209040	1214320	of credit for the people living in that watershed? So this would be what you were describing, a kind
1214320	1219760	of biosphere coin, that you would get renumerated or you would get, instead of destroying your
1219760	1225760	watershed, extracting things and selling it for profit in the old economy, you would begin to be
1225760	1230160	able to make your living by taking care of your watershed and keeping a whole lot of creatures
1230160	1236240	alive in it, which you can prove they're alive by this water test of the DNA. Well, it's new and
1236240	1241680	interesting. I'm totally in favor, long term, of something like that, and all these discussions,
1241680	1247280	I think there's two questions. Where do we want to go, and what's sustainable, and how do we get
1247280	1252640	there from here? And those are two different questions, but if we could have people making a
1252640	1260640	living by doing things that are healthy for the ecology, isn't that a much better use of a Keynesian
1260640	1267680	stimulus than just supporting people to buy flat screen TVs and take junket trips or whatever it
1267680	1275680	is, just the consumption as usual? That's the cultural shift that I think could happen, would
1275680	1282000	be a fantasy to happen, but I'm hopeful for in coming decades. Seems to me that what you're
1282000	1291280	talking about is also that it's not economic, but it's more experiential or philosophical,
1291280	1299280	or even a religious sensibility. In other words, what's life for? And many of us, and the way that
1299280	1304320	you live your life, to a certain extent the way I live my life, although I'm a very conventional
1304320	1311200	suburban guy still, but it's more interesting to do things than it is to watch things being done.
1312000	1320160	This, of course, is a stab to the heart of our current cultural imaginary of
1320160	1326080	social media and watching things on screens, a whole generational problem of your smart
1326080	1332800	form, your laptop screen, your big wall TV, watching things. And then other people do them,
1332800	1341520	and you watch them. This is so sapping of human spirit. It's so passive and observational.
1342080	1346480	It's like a half-life. It's like a Philip K. Dick half-life. And many people
1346480	1352240	live it because they haven't figured out that even just taking a walk down the lane to the
1352240	1356640	local store would be more interesting than what they were doing, or throwing pebbles at a bottle
1356640	1361600	on top of a fence top would be more interesting than these incredibly complicated computer games
1361600	1368400	being played on a flat screen. The third dimension, bodily life in the real world,
1368400	1376880	this is all more interesting than our artificial created advertising culture. So when people will
1376880	1382640	get that, how people will get that, whether that becomes a general sensibility, I don't know.
1382640	1388800	To me, it's as obvious as walking outdoors to other people, obviously not so much. So I don't
1388800	1394480	know exactly how to make that turn. One thing I'll say is that my books are always about people
1394480	1399680	doing stuff outdoors in the world. And maybe that's why my Washington DC novel was such a
1399680	1404000	trial for me and for its readers. There were too many meetings and offices.
1404000	1409120	Didn't you write one of your recent books fully while you were outside? I think I heard that
1409120	1414960	somewhere. Oh, that's true for my last books since I finished that DC trilogy. I'm starting
1414960	1420720	with Galileo's Dream, or even the last book of my DC trilogy. But for sure, Galileo's Dream
1420720	1425360	in every book since, so that's about seven or eight books now I've written entirely outdoors.
1425360	1431760	Now I'm in California, and in the winter I bundle up, in the summer I put a mister on. It can be
1431760	1436720	cold, it can be hot. I have a tarp overhead, so the rain just falls around me when there is rain.
1437760	1444000	And I work outdoors no matter what, very stubbornly, because it turned my writing into a little outdoor
1444000	1450960	adventure. And it saved my brain. I was a burned out case at that point, and now I'm very energized.
1451760	1459680	That's awesome. So you are a very busy person, Stan. This podcast has been scheduled for four
1459680	1466240	months. After we hang up later, are you going to go outside and write? Are you writing a novel now?
1467440	1471200	I'm not writing a novel now, and I'm antsy and feeling unhappy about it.
1471280	1478000	But the Ministry for the Future has kind of eaten my life, and I'm currently like the cardboard cut
1478000	1484160	out of the minister. I do a lot of events like this. And it's okay. I'm going to write a non-fiction
1484160	1492960	book about Antarctica. So I'm quite excited about that. Have you been there? I have. I've been twice.
1492960	1504240	So the first time was in 1995, and then I went again in 2016. I loved it. It was a big adventure.
1504240	1509120	A little strand of memoir will be in this book, just like in my Sierra book, where it was a big
1509120	1514640	strand. But in my Sierra book, I've been going to the Sierras for 50 years, and I've only gone
1514640	1520320	twice. So that strand will be small. But there'll be history, geology, and a little bit more about
1520320	1524400	this future plan of slowing the glaciers down so that we save sea level.
1525600	1532320	So in ministry, you incorporate chapters from mostly unspecified, non-human, non-living perspectives.
1532320	1539200	Why did you decide to incorporate these different perspectives, and what was your thought process
1539200	1544080	while writing them and trying to get into the mindset of these creatures or entities?
1544080	1554720	Well, thank you for that. I really enjoyed doing ministry as a kind of a miscellany, an anthology
1554720	1563360	of different styles, and genres, and modes, and character types. So this is actor network theory
1563360	1570560	out of Brunelatur, that our lives include very important contributions by creatures that aren't
1570560	1578480	human. The animals in your life, the microbiota inside your gut, these are actors in your
1578480	1584720	mentation and your life. And to write about that is a thing that literature ought to be doing
1584720	1590240	that it hasn't done enough of, because it's somewhat of a new perception. So I was thoroughly enjoying
1590240	1597680	that, and Anglo-Saxon literature can fit into one thick volume, all that we have left of it,
1597680	1602880	and about a third of that volume is riddles. So I enjoyed having riddles of, oh, well,
1602880	1608880	I am the thing that is always in control, but I never do anything. And so these riddle modes
1608880	1616800	were fun for me. I also very much enjoyed the eyewitness account, which I began to understand
1616800	1622320	as a new genre of its own that is not like fiction proper. The eyewitness account, you're usually
1622320	1628720	being interviewed, it's like 10 years later, you don't dramatize the scene, you go really fast,
1628720	1633520	and you judge what happened, what it meant to you and your life, what it meant to the world.
1633520	1638800	So the eyewitness account is interesting, and there are bundles of them. There are books of all
1638800	1644320	the things that women saw on their way on the Oregon Trail, or all of the things that happened
1644320	1652800	in Germany in April of 1945, or the French Revolution, etc., etc. It's a mode of history,
1652800	1660240	and when I realized I could do that for my future in ministry, it freed me up. And so it's not just
1660240	1667040	a photon or a carbon atom, or the sun that I have speaking in the first person, it's also individual
1667040	1671200	humans that you never learn their name, they never come back again, but they tell you something
1671200	1677200	interesting that they saw and did, and that for me was the key that turned the lock. I was happy.
1677760	1684720	So Stan, I recently did a podcast with climate modeling expert, Erica Thompson,
1684720	1691280	where we discussed the idea that models in general can go way beyond computer
1691280	1698560	programings, including the form of novels. So do you feel like the books that you write are a sort
1698560	1707520	of mental model of the potential futures that you see that allow a human, even if they don't
1707520	1712400	know the science or haven't taken a science course, it helps them construct a mental model?
1714000	1720720	Yes, absolutely. I often compare it to modeling exercises, but then what you would want is to
1720720	1726640	take the whole spread of science fiction stories and say each one is one run through from the
1726640	1733360	initial conditions to a different outcome, like in any modeling exercise scenarios, it's good to
1733360	1740320	compare them to scenario building. And the thing I would say that the novel brings to it, that the
1740320	1745520	others don't have, and there are things the others have that novels don't. But what novels bring,
1746480	1753680	some people call thick texture. And I think it's also just a time involvement and a giving of,
1753680	1759600	a generous giving of time on the part of the reader who has to imagine those sentences on the page
1760320	1766320	into some kind of internal lived experience. That takes effort, that takes hours. And when you're
1766320	1771280	done, you feel like you've kind of lived it. If the novel has worked well, you feel like you've
1771280	1777200	been there, done that, it's a time travel, it's telepathy, it's quite a magical thing, but it's
1777200	1782560	all in the reader's head. And so it's a modeling exercise with some heft to it, because you've
1782560	1789920	been there for a while and you've kind of lived it. So you've often spoken about narratives,
1789920	1795040	especially speculative fiction as a powerful tool to envision
1796960	1803600	positive change in the world. However, and despite its transformative intentions,
1804240	1813200	a lot of clarify climate fiction so far has been dystopian. And there has been science showing
1813200	1821120	that dystopia tends to reinforce the resignation to negative events, climate catastrophe, etc.
1821120	1826960	What are your thoughts on that? I think that's right. And I think it's a really serious problem.
1827040	1835120	I have become anti dystopian as a utopian science fiction writer. I've always had to acknowledge
1835120	1842080	that these are two sides of a coin. Utopia dystopia, things could get better, things could get worse.
1843520	1849360	It's dialectical, they both have their value in imagining. They're like the modeling exercises
1849360	1854800	we just talked about, and you'd need negative models to convince you don't go that way. So
1854800	1862000	dystopia has always had its use. Susan famously 1984 is a classic case of people saying they didn't
1862000	1868240	want to go to the land of big brother and false information, which maybe we've ended up at anyway.
1868240	1874480	But back to dystopias, there are now a kind of a comfort food. People read them or watch them on
1874480	1880080	TV in order to feel like superior, like, well, things may be bad for me, but at least they're
1880080	1886560	not that bad. And so you come away from them comforted. Is that why the the evening news at
1886560	1891120	6pm, they always lead with all these bad things happening in the world and my mom is obsessed
1891120	1896080	with watching the six o'clock news and it's all terrible? Because people, it makes them feel better
1896080	1902640	about their current situation? Yes, I worry about that. But also, if it bleeds, it leads. When it's
1902640	1909760	TV news, you need something that you can look at. So it can't be facts, it can't be a report,
1910080	1914240	it has to be visual and you have to have been able to capture it at that moment. So it's always
1914240	1921200	the aftermath of a crime, red lights, police tape, and a reporter outside going, oh, how horrible,
1921200	1926720	look how horrible this is. And it's simply a desire for visible drama, something that they
1926720	1931840	can get on tape within the within the day of what had happened or else it isn't new. So they're
1931840	1937520	struck by a structural problem of the you can't get visible evidence of the important things
1937520	1944400	that happened that day. So they're stuck with trivia. So the nexus of art and science on
1944400	1950480	environmental catastrophe and risk to the future is a really fine line, isn't it? Because we have to
1951840	1960800	create mental models in people's minds about the science of what is possible, but not so dystopian
1960800	1966320	that they just check out there's got to be avenues for personal and cultural response.
1967760	1972480	I think it's it's like what you say. And I think it's I call it a tightrope walk.
1973200	1979120	You have to convince people to walk the tightrope with you of not falling off on either side.
1979120	1986400	If you pay if you point out the danger that we're in, which is severe and existential,
1986400	1990000	you know, breaking planetary boundaries, causing a runaway, hot house, earth.
1990960	1995840	This is a mass extinction event. This is bad as it could get. So on the other hand,
1996560	2002800	powers of people of society of science in theory, if we got to act together,
2003440	2010800	a kind of a golden age of certainly the we have the tools and capacities to solve these problems
2011440	2016480	and get into a good space. And so that's the other side of the of the tightrope falling
2016480	2021760	off is say, oh, well, that's going to be okay. What gets called cruel optimism, where you just
2021760	2026160	shrug and say, look, the experts will take care of this. I'm living my life. I don't need to worry
2026160	2031280	about this. And indeed, you don't need to worry either way. If the world is going to hell in a
2031280	2035840	handbasket, then there's nothing you can do about it. If the world is headed towards utopia,
2035840	2042240	then you don't need to do anything about it. So the tightrope walk is very, it's very narrow.
2042240	2047760	It really is a tightrope that you have to stay a balanced on it and say the situation is dangerous.
2047760	2052640	There are things we can do and must do. And that's the line you have to hold to.
2054240	2061760	In your book, Ministry for the Future, one of the beginning premises was that millions of people
2061760	2067520	in the subcontinent of India died because of higher wet bulb combination of temperature and
2067520	2075360	humidity. How much of that wet bulb India framing was science fiction? And how much of it is what
2075360	2082880	you, Kim Stanley Robinson, actually believe about the future? Well, I'm terrified that it could happen.
2082880	2088800	That is one of the main reasons I wrote Ministry for the Future was reading about the wet bulb 35
2088800	2096240	limit of human endurance, which I read about in about 2017. And it wasn't that it was a new fact,
2096240	2102240	it was that the scientific and medical communities had kind of combined. People in the climate
2102240	2106560	community had been saying temperatures could get this high and people in the medical community
2106560	2111680	were pointing out that would kill a person if you weren't in air conditioning, because we're not good
2111680	2118960	at, we need to sweat off excess heat as bodily creatures. And that works in dry heat. In wet
2118960	2124560	heat, it works far less well. And at wet bulb 35, which is, as you said, an index of heat and
2124560	2130480	humidity in combination, then you die within several hours, whether or not you are in the
2130560	2135440	shade or not, whether you have a fan on you or not, because sweating stops working at wet bulb
2135440	2141520	35 in a way that you overheat internally. And hyperthermia will kill you just as fast as hypothermia.
2142400	2149840	This was news to me. And when I read it, I thought the idea that humans could adapt to anything
2150960	2157200	is a false one that, and this was a thought that was out there in the culture that, oh, humans
2157200	2161520	are so adaptable. We'll just adapt to higher temperatures. Why are people so worried? This
2161520	2168000	is sort of the view of what was called for a while the eco modernists, that essentially we're
2168000	2175040	adaptable, we can solve any problems, quit worrying so much about the carbon burn and a global average
2175040	2181520	temperature rise of four degrees Celsius. Big deal. Well, that turned out to be wrong. That's
2181520	2186240	flatly wrong. And they don't say that anymore. And that's partly because of ministry for the future.
2187440	2193520	I just put it out there that the news, the real news is that will kill us. And and vast swaths
2193520	2199040	of the world, including the American Southeast and the Midwest, like I know where you live,
2199040	2203360	the one of the hottest wet bulb temperatures ever recorded was right outside Chicago
2204080	2209360	in the early 1990s. And it was one of those flukes that happened. But it goes to show that
2209360	2215920	anywhere because it was so humid. Yeah, it was humid heat. It was like a wet bulb 32 or even wet
2215920	2225840	bulb 34 for a couple hours. And well, a functioning electricity system will allow you to get shelter
2225840	2230640	in air conditioning, you can save your life. But when the grid goes down and you don't have air
2230640	2235040	conditioning, then you'd be doomed. And that's sort of why I put it in India. That's a place
2235040	2239760	that's going to be very susceptible to these temperatures. It's got a weaker power grid
2240560	2245280	that fails often. And that was that combination was what I wanted to
2246880	2253280	indicate could be deadly soon. And so this isn't a real fear that I think a lot of people have,
2253280	2259440	if they're paying attention, it's we are having heat waves, people are dying in them.
2260640	2268240	I was in a wet bulb 31 in India last April, and I was interested because of having written my book,
2268240	2274320	maybe interest is too weak of a word. I was highly apprehensive and it turned out it was no worse
2274320	2281600	than a than a day in in Washington DC. You know, Washington DC during a hot summer's day steamy
2281600	2287760	heat, it will it will cook you up quickly. And this day was no worse than that because it wasn't
2287760	2296080	wet bulb 35. But we could get to that soon. So you know, this is a case of starting with dystopia,
2296160	2300720	of starting a novel with something happening so horrible that it gets the world's attention.
2300720	2306160	What I'm hoping is that since we know it can happen, we'll act before we have the disaster.
2308800	2314320	Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that. But that would be like a whole other podcast because I think
2316000	2322400	there's a systems challenge that we have and climate is but one of the risks that we face.
2322400	2330640	And it's downstream of our culture optimizing for profits tethered to energy tethered to carbon.
2331280	2337840	And so I personally don't think we are going to we will see foresee unless something radical happens.
2337840	2342000	But I think to see is pretty baked in the cake and that's going to be bad enough. But we're going
2342000	2349840	to have many other dystopian aspects to our future than just climate. So let me ask you
2352560	2358240	a hard question maybe. What I'm really interested to see how you will respond
2359120	2365280	is science fiction, not just your writing, but science fiction writ large, inherently techno
2365280	2372480	optimistic, colonizing space and these things to me seem energy and ecology blind from a
2372480	2381120	biophysical perspective. So I suppose books about an Earth Trek future where humans are using 80%
2381120	2387600	less material throughput and it's a tougher material existence, but perhaps greater spiritual
2387600	2394000	pursuits. That sort of book wouldn't actually be in the sci fi genre, it would be in something else.
2394560	2399520	But do you have any thoughts on that? No, that would be a science fiction story and it's a good
2399520	2406960	one. I'm going to make a simple cut and say science fiction is any story you set in the future.
2407760	2416160	So UN demographers, stock forecasters, everybody that pitches their story into the future and says
2416160	2421520	this is going to happen, they don't know that. The future is unknowable. So they're doing a
2421520	2428560	science fiction story often it's disguised as nonfiction or as futureology or business prediction.
2428560	2434480	It's often a scam because anybody who claims to know what the future is bringing is making a
2434480	2439680	false claim. So you have to be suspicious of it. And one thing science fiction does, it says, look,
2439680	2445280	this is a fiction. I'm making this up, but it's interesting anyway. And so if you put a story
2445280	2450160	out like yours, this is a good sign. It's a form of utopian science fiction. Things could be better
2450160	2457040	for these reasons. And that's the kind of science fiction I write all the time. I would agree with
2457040	2463440	you the dream of space I've written about this often. And I talk about the solar system as our
2463520	2470320	planetary neighborhood and actually amenable to human visitation in person, which would be more
2470320	2476320	or less interesting, depending not that interesting, like going to Antarctica, useful, interesting,
2476320	2481920	but not transformative. The dream of going to the stars is a fantasy, a false dream that's
2481920	2487360	impossible. I wrote about this in Aurora. It made myself very unpopular with the people who write
2487360	2492960	space fiction. Because I said, look, it's a great story space, like Middle Earth is a great story
2492960	2498480	space, but it's not real. We're not going there. It's too far away. Humans co-evolved with Earth.
2499120	2505280	We are stuck with Earth. That is not a bad thing. That is just part of being part of a planet.
2505280	2510880	Planetary consciousness is very important. And you no more should complain about that than you would
2511600	2515840	complain that you don't live on the inside of the sun or you're not an angel or you're not an ant
2515840	2521760	or something. You're a human on planet Earth and you're a planetary creature. There's an
2521760	2528000	interesting side case to be made that Mars, if we were to be in a good balance with Earth biosphere
2528000	2533920	and a stable civilization, Mars could become an interesting scientific station, blah, blah. That's
2533920	2541360	a separate and side issue, a kind of a random case. You can't see the same thing about Venus,
2541360	2546400	for instance, or the surface of Jupiter. But Mars, you could land on it. You could live on it.
2546400	2550240	You could set up a little space station there. A few people could live on it.
2550880	2558080	A few people. Like Antarctica today, the best analogy for Mars is Antarctica,
2558080	2564960	which we're there and nobody cares. And to me, it's Stephen, a very smart and famous people.
2564960	2572800	Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, among them kind of say, we're screwing up Earth. Climate's
2572800	2578960	going to be bad. We need to colonize outer space and head to Mars. And that makes just zero sense
2578960	2586160	to me because on the worst thermonuclear runaway climate scenario, Earth is still going to be
2586160	2593520	a paradise next to Mars. I agree with you completely. That is a case that has to be made. And the
2593520	2598720	thing about people like Hawking's, the thing about people like Elon Musk is they're smart.
2598720	2604960	They aren't that smart. They aren't wise. They aren't philosophers. And they are not ecologists.
2604960	2610160	Very often physicists will assume that ecology is just physics in action and that they've got it
2610160	2615680	all sussed out because they know the rules of physics and they can do rocketry. But you can't
2615680	2622480	do plant biology just knowing rocketry. It's more complex. It's more interconnected. It's a
2622480	2627280	more complex science. And many physicists will arrogantly say that because I know the laws of
2627280	2634880	physics, I know everything, but they don't know how Mars works. They haven't studied biology enough
2634960	2639760	to understand their own ignorance. So how smart are you if you don't know how ignorant you are?
2641760	2646640	Homo sapiens, we have not yet lived up to our moniker. I think we've been more clever man
2646640	2656800	than wise man. Let's hope. Homo Faber, humans, the makers. That's to me the best name. We do
2656800	2668880	make things and it's a real skill. So do you think in your writing you've often advocated for
2668880	2678880	a rewilding of Earth? I assume you're aware of E. L. Wilson's notion of half Earth as one of the
2678880	2685600	key solutions to the future. Is this possible? Are there any signs that we could eventually do
2685600	2694000	this in coming decades? Yes, I think there is. I love E. L. Wilson and his biofilia. He's a very
2694000	2699520	important public intellectual and philosopher, recently deceased, but I honor his memory and he
2699520	2707680	will be remembered like Ben Franklin or William James as an important American thinker. And half
2707680	2712880	Earth was crucial when it came out, but I thought it was quite utopian. And now we already have 30
2712880	2719200	by 30. All the nations on Earth have agreed to keep 30% of their lands wild by the year 2030.
2719200	2723600	China forced that deal through, which is super interesting. And now we have the same thing
2723600	2729840	for the oceans just completed after 10 years of negotiation. These are super hopeful signs
2729840	2734240	that are under reported in the news because people don't get it because they are indeed
2734240	2742160	living inside their social media and their laptops. So if you spent time outdoors, you
2742160	2746720	would realize that if 30% of the Earth's surface was left to the wild creatures and they became
2746720	2753360	healthy by that. And I'm told by the woman who runs the 30 by 30 program in California, which is
2753360	2760880	a formal state program, that we're at 24%. And that everybody in that pursuit talks about 30 by 30,
2760880	2767760	then 50 by 50, which would be the half Earth project by the year 2050. And yes, humans can indeed
2768400	2773200	do their agriculture and compress into the cities, which young people want to anyway, you wouldn't
2773200	2780320	have to force the issue. Organize our management of the landscapes in ways that don't mean pure
2780320	2786320	wilderness like humans never get to go here. That would be unusual in the extreme. But land use that
2786320	2793840	opens up the land to the wild animals and they get to live their lives unencumbered by us.
2793840	2801680	And then we live on the other 50% in ways that are intelligently managed in biosphere sense. So
2801680	2809280	we're helping also even on the land that we're on. Well, this is the plan. It's maybe the most
2809280	2814400	important part of the plan going forward, although you want to have a way to pay for it, etc.
2815360	2824000	But I hope that can happen. Even if it were to happen, though, it really isn't 30 or 50,
2824000	2830240	because the 30 or 50 assumes that everything else in the biosphere is constant. And we know that the
2830240	2838480	climate and other biogeochemical feedbacks are going to accelerate. So that 30% of ecosystems,
2838480	2845280	what it supports today, 20, 30 years from now, climate will have an impact on it, obviously.
2846080	2852080	Yeah, it's true. And I think you're just pointing out realities here that everybody ought to know.
2853840	2860320	For that reason, there are some wildlife ecologists and conservation biologists talking
2860320	2865360	about making sure these corridors established for the wild creatures have room for them,
2865360	2871600	the migrate northward in the northern hemisphere, to get away from the heat. And you mentioned the
2872400	2878080	inevitability, almost, of us creating a two degree Celsius rise in average temperature.
2878080	2884560	That's looking very, very likely, as you know, that's why you said it. So I'm saying that means
2884560	2889120	we're going to have to suck down a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere. That's going to be a project.
2889680	2895440	Regenerative agriculture, reforestation, and even mechanical vacuum cleaners sucking it out of the
2895440	2902800	air, everything is going to have to be applied to get us back down to, I don't know, 350 parts per
2902800	2909280	million. It makes sense. I mean, there's a reason Bill McKibben chose it as the name of his organization.
2909280	2914240	We could do it if we don't have a runaway that blows out our abilities to do it.
2914240	2922720	Well, we could do it. Stan, I don't think you've watched much of my material because you're so
2922720	2931280	busy and we just recently met. But one of my recent framings is I call it Mordor or the Great
2931280	2937600	Simplification. The Great Simplification is when we can no longer kick the can financially,
2938160	2944800	and the amount of financial claims we've created crashed down in a snapping rubber band to our
2944800	2949840	biophysical reality, which means a smaller economy and smaller emissions going forward.
2949840	2957840	On the other hand, if we are able to do more carbon finance trickery and quantitative easing
2957840	2964320	number nine or whatever, we'll continue to grow the gross amount of energy that the world uses,
2964400	2971440	which results in GDP. But the net amount of energy that goes to hospitals and science fiction books
2971440	2977920	and Disneyland and shopping centers, that is going to be more and more directed towards the
2977920	2983280	energy and mining sector itself. They're going to need to use more to get the lower quality
2983280	2992640	resources and the mechanical vacuum cleaners and things like that, that take care of our
2992640	2999360	environmental waste. So a much larger percentage of GDP will go to energy and environmental
2999360	3005440	remediation. So in that scenario, the rest of the economy gets priced out a little bit.
3007360	3012640	If we're going to get down to 350, if that were to be a cultural objective, which I
3012640	3018160	am skeptical on, we would have to give up a lot of other things in order to make that the primary
3019120	3020400	focus. Yes?
3022480	3031920	Maybe. I take your point. It makes sense. I am interested in the people who are talking about
3031920	3041920	things like regenerative agriculture, that we could both grow our food and capture more carbon
3042000	3046960	in the soil that we grow our food in. So we have more biosphere health,
3049120	3055440	as much food, and more CO2 sucked out of the atmosphere all at once. I'm always looking to
3055440	3060960	these multiple goods where we need food, but we also need less CO2 in the atmosphere if we can
3060960	3068880	do both at once, which is a technique. And agriculture is a science and a technique that
3068880	3076320	people spend a whole lot of time studying. Right now, in the fields of America, especially
3076320	3084640	corn and soy, the carbon in the soil by weight is down to about 1%. And it could be that with some
3086080	3091360	changes to agricultural methods, we could begin to draw down. And it tops out pretty quickly.
3091360	3096960	You can't get more than 3% or 4% of carbon by weight in the soil before you have kind of
3096960	3101440	topped out that soil. It's not an infinite bank, but it's so much soil.
3101920	3110400	So just hypothetically, if we went from 1% carbon by weight in the soil to 3% globally,
3110400	3116240	just hypothetically, what would that do to drawing down the carbon roughly? Do you have
3116240	3124000	any idea? Well, it's incredible. And yet it's apparently true that that is enough carbon to
3124000	3128320	that's as much carbon as we've burned out into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution
3128320	3135680	began. Really? So yes, it's an enormous sink. Now, I mean, I'm told this by people who are
3135680	3140240	studying it, I am still a science fiction writer, I'm a reporter, but I'm telling you,
3140240	3147120	there are people who say this. Well, I'm actually a lot more sanguine about regenerative agriculture
3147120	3157360	than the mechanized vacuum cleaners. So if you have any world expert on regenerative agriculture,
3157360	3162960	you could introduce me to and I can take a deep dive on that publicly on a podcast. I would welcome
3162960	3167920	that. What are your thoughts on... I can do that. I've just run into those people. I am going to
3167920	3174960	write that down. Okay, awesome. Thank you. What are your thoughts on geoengineering? Will we eventually
3174960	3179440	be faced with the obvious, oh my God, look at what's happening with climate and we'll have
3179440	3186960	to try it? Are you morally against it? Are you hopeful of some of the science there or what do
3186960	3196000	you think? I think it might be a break glass in case of emergency type operation. I am not morally
3196000	3201280	against it. We've already geoengineered this earth to within an inch of its life. That's
3201360	3207760	called climate change and biosphere collapse. Civilization has been geoengineering all along.
3208720	3214000	Right to the beginning of burning down Australia when humans first arrived there, etc. So it's an
3214000	3220720	old practice. Now, if we needed to do it because people were dying all over the tropics because of
3220720	3227120	wet bulb 35 temperatures happening all the time, then this thing people talk about of casting dust
3227120	3234560	into the atmosphere and imitating a penitubo type volcanic eruption, dropping worldwide
3234560	3239040	temperatures for a degree or two for five years after which the dust falls back to the ground.
3240720	3246160	I think the real issues there are governance issues. How do we decide to do it? How do we get
3246160	3252560	public buy-in and it doesn't look like some weird Dr. Strange-Levian type experiment with the earth
3252560	3259040	itself? We've already been experimenting with the earth itself in ridiculously bad ways and a lot
3259040	3265040	of times in ignorance of what we were doing. So this would be being done on purpose in full
3265040	3270240	knowledge of what we were doing. I think we should study it. I think we should discuss the governance
3270240	3279040	of it. There are also more, what can I say, less alarming versions of geoengineering. For instance,
3279120	3283680	if you slow down the glaciers in Antarctica, you can call that geoengineering, but there are no
3283680	3289680	negative side effects that I know of. Then there are people talking about the whales that when we
3289680	3296800	killed off 95% of the whales on this planet, we wrecked the ocean's bio pump, which is also a
3296800	3304160	nice carbon drawdown mechanism, and that replacing the whales. Since you can't just replace whales,
3304160	3311520	you can replace whale poop, which is a chemical formulation, a kind of living bio excrement
3311520	3318640	of whales dropped into the ocean would create the same biospheric conditions that existed
3318640	3324880	before we wrecked it. So this would also be geoengineering in a peculiar way and is being
3324880	3330640	discussed. So the topic is huge and I don't want to go into all of the rabbit holes involved there,
3330640	3335840	but I certainly think that it's something that people should be able to talk about it
3335840	3340800	without a sense of shock and awe or, oh my God, there are some things man was not meant to know
3340800	3346400	type mentality. I mean, we're far past that. We are in an emergency situation and certain
3346400	3352400	emergency gestures may become necessary that we don't get a runaway into a hot house earth, which
3352400	3363280	could happen. Do you ever get the sense or just this like deja vu weird sense looking at the news
3363280	3371360	and looking around the world that we are living a science fiction novel reality that none of you
3371360	3377280	writers could have imagined 20 or 30 years ago. Every day, there's just crazy stuff happening
3377280	3383920	left right and center. And it's almost like the Twilight Zone. This is like a real Twilight
3383920	3391200	Zone meets reality TV our lives. Well, yes, I've been saying this for about 25 years. We are in a
3391200	3396880	science fiction novel that we are all co authoring together. And what I mean is the future is crashing
3396880	3402000	us that that there's the great acceleration has accelerated yet again, and everything's happening
3402000	3406960	faster than we can come to grips with. And that's what a science fiction novel is trying to capture
3407040	3413120	is that feeling. So for sure. But what you would want, although Twilight Zone was a great show,
3413920	3419520	you would want something more like I don't know Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispissed, which which
3419520	3425200	actually is very troubled and filled with revolutions and conflict. So it's not like you're
3425200	3429840	going to dodge revolutions and conflict here because we're in the midst of it. It's a very
3431040	3435120	melodramatic science fiction novel that we're caught in the middle of and we just have to try
3435120	3443440	to write it towards utopia. I actually posted on Twitter a month ago that I my entire life is
3443440	3452000	filled with nonfiction and I needed some fiction recommendations and I had 1000 replies. And Ursula
3452000	3456880	K. Le Guin's Dispissed was like among the most popular ones. So I just bought it. I have it
3456880	3462640	outside. I've not read it. That's good. So are all those books behind you? Are those all science
3462640	3471840	fiction books? No, that's a non this is a nonfiction shelf. I keep John Muir. This is accidental,
3471840	3476720	but I have a full shelf of John Muir and then a full shelf of California nonfiction and the top
3476720	3484320	shelf is Antarctica. I see a really long shelf of Antarctica. That might be the 90% of Antarctica
3484320	3489520	in literature right there. So just out of curiosity, how many hours a week do you spend reading?
3489920	3499360	Oh, well, a lot. I read nonfiction by day and I I treat it instrumentally. I almost strip
3499360	3506160	mind my nonfiction to get what I need for my fiction. So I read nonfiction all day and but
3506160	3514880	I'm writing also, I reckon it must add up to a couple three hours of reading per day of nonfiction.
3514880	3519920	And then every night when I go to bed, I read fiction for about a half hour or an hour.
3519920	3524800	Depends on how long I can stay awake. But I'm always reading a novel and when I finish one,
3524800	3532960	I start another one. And I love it. I love reading fiction. Reading nonfiction, I don't love,
3532960	3538800	but it's important. It's part of my work. It's good literary hygiene that you've described two
3538800	3545200	hours of nonfiction half hour of fiction before bed. Yeah, yeah. And I let and I must say,
3545200	3550400	read a novel when you go to bed and you'll be absorbed you'll fall asleep in a different world.
3550960	3555760	You'll live that life. It will be the best part of your day or let's put it this way,
3555760	3561600	you'll look forward to it every day. Oh, good. Now I get to dive into like right now I'm reading
3561600	3568000	the ragged, trousered philanthropists, a British working class novel from about 1904,
3568000	3574160	very funky, very serious, very sad, very intense working class life when you were in
3574160	3579200	the precarity, precarity really means it when you're going to die if you lose your job
3579840	3585280	and your family too. And then I'm also reading Freddie the Pig and the baseball team from Mars,
3585280	3590000	a children's book that I read when I was a child. Obviously, it had a big impact on me since I still
3590000	3595280	play softball and I still write about Mars. And then sort of lighten the load. I usually just read
3595280	3600240	one novel at a time to tell you the truth. I think that's the best way you join that world.
3600240	3605440	But in this case, I'm kind of lightening the load of the ragged trouser philanthropists.
3606560	3616480	Well, lightening the load is is part of the, you know, the recipe to remain sane in these times,
3616480	3624160	because you and I in the stories we're trying to share with society, this stuff can get toxic
3624160	3629760	reading and learning. Like you said, a few years ago, you learned about wet bulb 35. I just learned
3629760	3638320	about that two years ago. And you just add these things. And the human physiology and our genome
3638320	3644800	didn't evolve to handle this much toxic information about our world. So we need antidotes. I have
3644800	3648640	dogs and I live in a forest, but I also like fiction reading as well.
3649600	3656000	Well, I think that what I read about you before we got on this podcast, that this that you figured
3656000	3661280	it out, that you're living on the land, you're paying attention to a particular piece of land,
3661280	3666960	and you've got other animals, companion species, that you're taking care of and helping and they're
3666960	3673200	helping and teaching you things to you as an animal, that this is what everybody, if everybody
3673280	3678960	had it figured out to that extent. And even you can you can you can live a life in an apartment
3678960	3683920	in Manhattan that includes these things if you've got it figured out in the first place. So it's
3683920	3691760	really a matter of understanding what we are and then adapting living your life to accommodate what
3691760	3696640	we really are, which is animals and social primates and all the things that we obviously are.
3697360	3704240	The more you embrace that and live it rather than sitting on your butt looking at screens all day
3704880	3709920	every day, that will drive you mad. And so we live in a culture that's slightly mad.
3712160	3718480	I agree. Thank you for that. I'm not sure I have it all figured out and I do still need to read
3718480	3728240	the equivalent of Freddie the pig at night. So key question here, climate and to a lesser extent
3728240	3735600	biodiversity and PFAS and endocrine disruptors and all these other things are becoming more aware
3735600	3743440	and teenage humans are coming into learning about the world and learning all this stuff.
3744080	3750800	And I've taught a college course for eight of the last 10 years. In my experience, there's a lot
3750800	3757040	of scary material at the, you know, I don't know how many tens of thousands of climate courses there
3757040	3763200	are in high school and college, but worldwide. And there's scary material. This is what's
3763200	3766800	happening in the climate. These are the scenarios. This is what's going to happen in the 21st century.
3767360	3771840	But there's kind of too narrow a solution set just at the end of the semester as well. We
3771840	3778800	switch to renewables, you drive an EV or we end capitalism. But do you think that we're approaching
3778800	3786080	a time when there could be more systemic story and recommendations to young people that involves
3786640	3793280	behavior change from within like being happy with social natural human capital rather than
3793280	3800320	financial status? You know, what are your thoughts on this? Are we are we approaching young people
3800320	3803520	with the right message on on all these systemic crises?
3804960	3813120	I don't know. It's a good question. It speaks to what Raymond Williams called a structure of feeling
3813120	3819840	that a civilization has a structure of feeling that is cultural. It's not biological. And it
3821120	3826960	and it changes over time at different historical moments. I think actually of the the list that
3826960	3832000	you made ending capitalism, if young people are being talked to about that, that would be crucial.
3832000	3836080	I don't think they are. They live in capitalist realism where they're going to be told
3837040	3841840	typically nothing can ever change. This is the system you have to plug into it. The system is
3841840	3847200	unchangeable. And that's not true. The system is changeable and has to change because biosphere
3847200	3853360	reality is forcing change. So may they might be aware that change is coming fast and it isn't
3853360	3858400	planned and it's going to be incomprehensible. I see a lot of climate dread, a lot of anxiety
3858400	3862960	the young people, a sense that well, we're doomed but ready. And no matter what we do,
3862960	3869840	we're just on a downhill slide into chaos and disorder, which is not an inaccurate assessment
3869840	3877360	of the way things feel for sure. And you can't change the feeling just by pushing a button or
3877360	3882320	saying some magic words. You actually have to change the political economy that you're in
3882320	3887680	to one that's more life positive. So ending capitalism would be one big,
3887680	3892880	I mean, geez, when you say it, it's just so radical. I would say now reforming capitalism
3892880	3898800	extremely rapidly to getting to something that is more like cooperatives. It is post capitalism
3898800	3904400	in its first step. That would be a big step and we aren't really there but we're trembling on the
3904400	3911120	brink. I think also there was a world order working in the neoliberal times, say the 1990s,
3911120	3915360	that isn't working anymore because it doesn't take into account the biosphere or what we really
3915360	3920880	are as creatures. And yet there's now 8 billion of us. So the old system isn't working. The new
3920880	3926480	system hasn't yet been invented. This is often talked about the in between the interagnum between
3926480	3933120	one system and the other. It feels frightening because you can't, despite me being a science
3933120	3938240	fiction writer, what I can say from that is you can't see the future. You can't predict the future.
3938320	3944800	There's too many factors and it's changing too fast. So I mean there's reason for everybody to
3944800	3951360	feel anxiety and climate dread but what you can do and say to the young people is solutions are
3951360	3957040	out there. Let's make the solutions happen. Let's work together on the solutions. You'll be one
3957040	3962400	little brick and a giant wall but the wall is possible. We can build that wall and you put
3962400	3968000	your brick into place and you'll be part of that historical wave, that movement that changed
3968560	3974560	this generation is tasked with a really heavy task to dodge a mass extinction event
3974560	3981440	that previous generations started mostly by accident. Well, tough assignment and people
3981440	3987440	will be freaking out the entire time and even fighting against you the entire time. So it couldn't
3987440	3994880	be weirder, harder and all you can do is try to call out for solidarity, put your shoulder to the
3994880	4001120	wheel and fight the good fight anyway. So do you ever speak to younger audiences in addition
4001120	4007280	to your activist message that you just described? What sort of advice do you give to teenage humans
4007280	4015760	who are old enough to intellectually understand this stuff but not yet sucked into the consumptive
4015760	4024080	vortex of modern society? Do you have personal advice to young teenage or early 20 humans?
4024880	4031680	Yes, I talk to all the schools in Davis on a regular basis because I have teacher friends who
4031680	4037040	asked me to come by and in Davis it's easy and then I talk to college students all over the world
4037840	4042960	in literally the case and they're young enough that they're forming their ideologies, they're
4042960	4047120	figuring out their ways in life, they're thinking about what they're going to do with their lives
4047120	4055280	and they're very active and open-minded. That's the crowd to talk to I think and it's a privilege
4055280	4060880	to talk to them, I try to learn from them and listen to them as much as I can and what I just say
4060880	4065520	to them is no matter what you're interested in and you can follow your interests, follow your
4065520	4071040	nose, I'm interested in art, I'm interested in engineering, I'm interested in plant biology and
4071040	4077280	why bugs eat plants and why plants are protected from bugs, whatever you're interested in,
4077280	4084320	it's a climate change project now. You can be anything, a sculptor or an accountant,
4085040	4091520	someone measuring things and engineering for sure, well it's going to be climate change work,
4091520	4095280	there will be work for you that's good work and here's how I try to encourage them.
4096080	4103280	When I was in younger middle age there was a joke, the one who dies with the most toys wins,
4104000	4114160	it was a bumper sticker and it was making fun of and expressing the meaningless cynicism of
4114160	4121360	middle-class American society circa 1990, it was an 80s thing, a 90s thing, people were worried,
4122080	4127360	the capitalist wheel of birth and death, you work all your life then you die, nothing matters,
4127360	4132880	I mean what's the point here, so this is what the bumper sticker was making a joke about,
4133440	4140400	whoever dies with the most toys wins, obviously stupid, absurd, a lack of meaning and this was
4140400	4145760	the problem. Well now I can say to young people, your life has meaning, we are in a crisis,
4145760	4153840	everything you do can actually fight for the people of the future, it's a cause and so life
4153840	4159760	has meaning, it may be a rather scary and desperate meaning but it's better than no meaning at all,
4159760	4165600	which was the previous problem that's completely gone away, so sometimes I try to cheer them up,
4165600	4168960	you know you're lucky to have climate change because otherwise you'd be in an existential
4168960	4174000	despair because capitalist reality is totally stupid and you've got to get past that.
4174640	4180720	Yeah two comments there, first I remember seeing that bumper sticker, I didn't know it was a joke,
4180720	4187440	I thought people actually believed that, I didn't know and secondly yeah, I've heard this from a
4187440	4194880	lot of my students and colleagues, we have a lack of meaning in our culture right now,
4196080	4203200	you know kind of the theology of past religions and then the theology of economic growth
4204560	4210240	are waning and what is it all for, what is our purpose and what other purpose can there be
4211120	4218000	in my opinion than the viability of the ecosystems on our planet for the long term,
4218000	4223120	to me it all comes back to that and climate's a piece of that but it's not the only piece.
4223680	4229200	It's not the only piece, yeah, so you're living in Wisconsin and it's a Wisconsin guy,
4229200	4236000	Aldo Leopold, what's good is what's good for the land, well this is a very powerful statement,
4236720	4242960	very powerful, it's a philosophy, it's a religion and when he said the land I think he means all
4242960	4250080	the living things that make up the land of course, it's easily understood and it's incredibly
4250080	4257680	powerful as an ethos but also as a decider, you can say well what's good, I mean you've got your
4257680	4262320	opinion, I've got my opinion, you can't determine it but what's good is what's good for the land
4262320	4267440	because that's what'll be passed on to the other animals and to the generations to come so
4268720	4276080	the Leopoldian land ethic as it's called in ethics and philosophy classes and ecology classes,
4276080	4284640	this is a very, very high statement of how you can, in a single phrase, you can make up a new
4284640	4294480	religion that makes sense. I love that, you know in my job now I'm non-ideological because I'm
4294480	4302400	trying to unite many different groups of humans towards a common, you know, path that's going to
4302400	4311920	face all of us so I'm apolitical but if I do have an ideology it's what you just said,
4312000	4318800	it's that I deeply care about the ecosystems and other species and irrespective of everything else
4318800	4324240	that I write and speak about, at the end of the day that is something that I have no shame to tell
4324960	4330560	at the rooftops to any political group or age group or that's what really matters
4331440	4338800	during our times right now. I'll just throw that back at you unintendedly, what do you care most
4338800	4346080	about in the world? I mean you're a very accomplished author and activist but like at the end of the
4346080	4351920	day what I think I could probably guess but I'll ask you anyways because I ask all my guests what
4351920	4358160	do you care most about in the world Stan? Well I'm just like everybody else, the answers are
4358160	4366080	immediate and instinctive, I care about my family, my friends, my community, I care about animals in
4366080	4371920	a way that I didn't when I was younger. I just recently went to India for the first time and what
4371920	4377520	I noted immediately was they live their lives with animals still as part of daily town life
4378160	4384800	in a way that's incredibly beautiful and inspiring but maybe I'll turn it back and I just want to say
4384800	4394880	that um an ideology is the imaginary relationship to the real situation and therefore everybody has
4394880	4402240	one and has to have one. If you don't have one that would be a mental disability quite severe
4402240	4407680	so we all have that imaginative relationship to the real conditions of existence which is what an
4407680	4413600	ideology is so you have one too and that translates to a politics which you have one too. It can be
4413600	4420080	ecumenical, it can be directed to a particular kind of point that tries to transcend stupid
4420080	4428400	partisan divides in the current mediated American landscape or older visions of left
4428400	4434800	and right etc etc etc. Sure those are deserved to be transcended in some kind of biophilia,
4435600	4441520	some kind of land ethic, we'll do this for the good of our land in the local area, all the
4441520	4446320	creatures on it including the humans and that will be you know that's a little vague, it's more like
4446320	4453440	a religion than a politics but it can go to a politics. Yeah there we go, we are looking at
4453440	4462240	biophilia by Edward O. Wilson, Edward Wilson, beautiful concept. Yeah I have almost all his books
4462240	4468800	and I agree with what you said earlier. Um what uh well actually I wonder if I have uh
4469120	4477440	uh well he oh yeah here I have this book um The Superorganism by Yeo Wilson uh I wrote an
4477440	4485280	academic paper about the superorganism um which I'll send to you so um in all of your travels
4485280	4492800	and your lectures to young people and and your work what things have you noticed or experienced
4492800	4498800	in the last couple years since ministry came out that really give you hope and motivation
4498800	4505520	about coming decades despite all the craziness in the Twilight Zone-esque uh sci-fi world we're living
4505520	4515520	in? Well it's a little um technical but it's true I've been encouraged by the 30 by 30 movements and
4515520	4522560	the COP 15 the biosphere um treaty in Montreal that the Chinese hosted with the Canadians
4523680	4530480	last year astonishing the ocean treaty just signed astonishing these are big victories
4530480	4534720	and even though they're just promises that nation states make to each other in other words they can
4534720	4543280	be broken by other people later on those promises matter because it's a putting forth of uh statements
4543360	4548960	of intent and that these things are important I learned that there's a network for greening
4548960	4557360	the financial system that is uh owned and operated by and and joined by about 90 of the biggest
4557360	4564000	central banks on earth including the super big ones out of the G7 and the G20 although central
4564000	4569760	banks are trying to green the financial system such that there is- That sounds like an oxymoron to me.
4569760	4576640	Well but but that that's uh that would be bad if it was an oxymoron you want to correct that um the
4577520	4583920	money needs to be spent which is to say human labor needs to be expended and you have to be
4583920	4589520	able to make your living doing good biosphere work rather than bad biosphere. Oh so this gets
4589520	4594880	back to the ecology coin we talked about earlier something like that. Yeah yeah and and uh you
4594880	4599440	can look it up the network for greening the financial system has a website it has a white
4599440	4604960	paper with nine suggestions they they're pretty technical like two of them I don't even understand
4606320	4612320	but what they're really saying is that money itself is a political act the and the fact that
4612320	4617120	everybody believes in money and you can go down and stick a piece of plastic into a slot and then
4617120	4623600	someone will give you a cup of coffee so that's that kind of belief is very deep and cooperative
4623600	4631360	belief in money if money itself was greened at the roots and is being made up at its very start
4631360	4639120	by central banks and this is fiat money in other words the US dollar being spent on green projects
4639120	4645920	first and then circulating in the general economy of that itself might drive a lot of
4646720	4653920	restoration actions and might allow us to dodge the mass extinction of it. I will I will look into
4653920	4660240	that I think I at least partially agree with that but with a big old asterisk stand which is
4660960	4668400	as long as we have GDP as our global cultural goal we will burn more energy and consume more
4668400	4673920	stuff and if we get more efficient we're just going to burn more so if we have a an overlay in
4674000	4680000	there of green of where the money goes into something green first I have to think about
4680000	4686240	how that would work. No and no I take your point and both of the things you said are right GDP is
4686240	4695200	wrong it is a rubric an index and a way of measuring human civilization that is flatly wrong
4695200	4703120	and destructive and so growth of which is usually a shorthand for growth of GDP that's a growth of
4703120	4710960	destruction and is like a cancer so human development index gross national happiness this is a
4710960	4718880	Bhutanese thing other indexes that rate the human economic efforts by a different set of standards
4718880	4726320	these are crucial that's a crucial part of the work. So if you could wave a magic wand and there
4726320	4732320	was no personal recourse to your actions what is one thing that you would do to improve human
4732400	4738960	and planetary futures and as a science fiction author I imagine you have dozens of such ideas.
4740720	4749520	I don't know I I mean it all it sounds so instrumentalist or technical and maybe I
4749520	4754240	should put it at the level of the structure of feeling like you've been talking about a different
4754240	4763600	attitude towards life. I mean some of it is absolutely simplistic if people would spend
4763600	4771840	more time outdoors it would reorient their sense of reality in fundamental ways that changes the
4771840	4778160	view of everything. We spend too much time indoors we live in boxes looking at boxes this is silly
4778160	4784080	stuff and it's distorting our sense of what's real and what's important so I mean that's a
4784080	4791040	little simple you could also go technical like I have been in most of this talk if fiat money was
4791040	4798160	created with a good green spending of it first off the bat then many other things would be better
4798880	4805200	30 by 30 if I could if I could instantly say that 50 percent of the earth and the ocean were left
4805280	4811600	to the other animals and that we concentrated our activities on 50 percent of the earth and 50
4811600	4817840	percent of the oceans if I could wave that magic wand and here's the thing people are already waving
4817840	4824880	it the 30 by 30 thing is profound when I first read the Yale Wilson book half earth I thought
4824880	4831920	beautiful idea will never happen and here 20 years later it's happening well I'm stunned and
4831920	4836880	now here it's worth following for a second why is that happening I think everybody
4837920	4843600	at the level of decision making and policy and also all well-meaning citizens who understand
4843600	4847760	that their lives depend on science and what they're scared for their lives they run to a scientist
4847760	4852400	which is to say their doctor they looked at the evidence they've taken it in they've realized
4852400	4858720	we're in a biosphere emergency and that civilization will crash if the biosphere crashes and we've only
4858720	4864240	got 10 or 15 years to cope with it but it's better than having only one week to cope with it
4864240	4869440	which we couldn't do and it's better than having 500 years to cope with it because we wouldn't pay
4869440	4875280	attention so we're in an emergency and people are acting like it but it's an actionable
4875280	4880000	emergency space in other words we've got this 10 or 15 years and I think the good things are
4880000	4885680	happening because there are so many people who actually know this now and they are doing something
4885680	4895440	about it. So last just personal question how many hours a day you live in California so
4895440	4899840	that's different than Wisconsin but how many hours a day do you actually spend outside
4899840	4906480	and how is that different from 10 or 15 years ago? Well because I moved my writing life outdoors
4906480	4912560	and my recreational life which is you know an hour of throwing frisbee golf at a running pace
4912560	4917120	with my friend and going for a walk with my wife I'm calculating here as I talk
4918880	4924000	and you can well you can't see it in this morning light my poor skin is taking a hit from all this
4924000	4930800	outdoorsness I should use sunscreen it's probably I'm outdoors about eight hours a day. Awesome
4932320	4937920	and is that an increase from 15 20 years ago? Yeah but that's a simple structural change I
4937920	4944720	started writing outdoors rather than indoors and so that's five hours a day. Yeah awesome
4944720	4954160	Stan this has been great thank you so much for your mental neuronal connections that end up creating
4954160	4960560	new mental imagery and connections in other humans it's an art and a skill and a gift
4961120	4967520	and I hope I hope you have a great next novel in mind and we'll have another conversation.
4968320	4973280	Well thank you Nate it's been a pleasure and I might not have another novel for a long time
4973280	4981120	but it's okay I am I'm doing other things I've had an awfully long writing career and so if I get
4981120	4985840	a few years off to kind of reorganize my poor brain that's probably a good thing too so
4986800	4988960	I'll be having fun yeah thanks Stan
