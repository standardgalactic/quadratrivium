00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Welcome to another episode of The Great Simplification. Today, I'm very pleased

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:12,800
to welcome my friend and self-described renegade economist Kate Rayworth. Kate

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,760
is known for her book, Donate Economics, Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:25,200
Economist, and the related lab that she co-founded, Donate Economics Action Lab,

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,720
which is putting into practice the planetary boundaries and human

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,520
sufficiency in the doughnut around the world. She's also a senior associate at

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,440
Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, as well as a professor of

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,920
practice at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. She's an incredible

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,720
communicator, and I think her work on doughnut economics is painting a picture

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,880
that people can understand, that we are part of a broader system that we're

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,160
influencing, and the current economic rules and institutions are not

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,080
only creating environmental overshoot, but they're really not doing a great

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,560
job for the humans. This was an incredible conversation. I hope to have Kate

14
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,600
back on various reality roundtables. She's doing very important work. Please

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,200
welcome Kate Rayworth.

16
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,000
Kate, great to see you.

17
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,200
It's great to be here.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,960
How are you?

19
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,400
I'm well.

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,600
You are very busy, I imagine.

21
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,320
Yeah, I think everyone's busy, right? We can all make busy, but I'm well, and

22
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,840
I'm really looking forward to this conversation, obviously.

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,920
Thank you for all the important work you're doing. Your book, Doughnut

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,600
Economics, and your ongoing work with Doughnut Economic Action Lab are

25
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,720
influencing and inspiring a lot of people, so thank you. Let me ask you a

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:10,520
question. Many of us that worked in finance and economics had kind of a

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,760
aha moment where we left the dark side. For me, it was 20 years ago on

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,360
Wall Street reading Herman Daley's book, but you're a classically trained

29
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,400
economist, now an ecological economist. What were some of your aha moments

30
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,720
that caused you to pause and like, wait a minute, do you have any acute

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,960
stories or memories?

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,160
So I studied economics at university in the 1990s. I had the, what's the

33
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,920
opposite of an aha moment? It's like, oh, no, moment, that kind of, oh, no,

34
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,400
moment when, you know, I've come to study economics because I care about the

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,800
environment. There's no paper on the environment at all. There was nothing.

36
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,640
It was like one week in public economics, you know, a company paused

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,520
chemical gloop in the river, that kind of, that was it. When we talked about

38
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,920
inequality, it always would begin with taking initial income distribution as

39
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,600
given. Would this Pareto change, improve things? And I was like, why, why

40
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,640
do we take income, things as given? Why don't we start with asserting human

41
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,480
rights? So I had quite a lot of, oh, no, this isn't turning out to be the tool

42
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,240
kit. I was really hoping it would be, which is why when I left university, I

43
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,800
didn't want to call myself an economist. I actually walked away from it for

44
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
many, many decades. But then make, like many other people, I had those aha

45
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,840
moments that started bringing me back. So one of the first ones was seeing the

46
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,840
planetary boundaries diagram. I have it actually right here. It's, it was seeing

47
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,480
it into my brain. I came back from maternity leave. And somebody showed me

48
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,880
this. And it was a massive, oh, that's the beginning of 21st century

49
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,080
economics. Because like you, I had just read Herman Daley's book, Beyond

50
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,840
Growth. That made my brain flip. And when I saw this picture in 2010, I was

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,640
thinking, well, the, the, Joanne Rockstone, Will Steffen and the planetary

52
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,040
boundary scientists, they have quantified that biosphere around the economy

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,200
that Herman Daley drew. He conceptualized it. They quantified it. And we are

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,560
game. We are on. Here we go. And that's why I drew a circle within a circle and

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,920
created the donor. That was a massive aha moment for me. Somebody else then

56
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,920
mentioned a couple of years later, well, of course, the work of Danela Meadows

57
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:22,120
thinking in systems, I'm like, that sounds interesting. What's that? Then when

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,680
I read thinking in systems, it was a massive aha. There is no turning back

59
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,040
from this. And why wasn't I taught economics in systems thinking? Why

60
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,480
weren't we taught to think of the economy as a complex adaptive system in

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,040
feedback loops? So it was a real deep frustration with what I'd been taught

62
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,640
and, and just a thrill of finding these ideas. And it was this collective

63
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,800
series of aha's that made me think, I want to make these ideas dance on the

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,640
same page. That's what led me to read, to write donor economics. I want to see

65
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,480
what happens when you bring Eleanor Ostrom's comments theory together with

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,560
Danela Meadows thinking in systems together with Herman Daley's ecological

67
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,640
economics together with feminist economics. What do we get next? So it was

68
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,400
definitely these aha moments that brought me back.

69
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,520
Why don't we teach thinking in systems and, and these planetary boundaries and

70
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,120
some of the things you just mentioned to undergrads in college?

71
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,840
Because the mainstream economic textbook and thinking and the ideology

72
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,800
behind it is a self contained self affirming system that has worked very

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,000
well nicely. Thank you for decades and carries on being taught and students

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,560
keep enrolling for economics. And I think there's a real inertia of

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,440
self questioning when inside the discipline. And why disrupt something

76
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,120
that has apparently been working? I mean, to me, the most radical act in

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,400
economics would be to draw Herman Daley's circle of the biosphere around

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,880
every single model of the economy. Why don't we do that? Because that's what

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,360
changes everything. And I think there's it changes the professor's

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,920
professionalism, it changes who is the expert here, it changes the

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,480
foundations of analysis. So it causes a massive disruption in the

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,000
hierarchies that have been built up around which are the best journals,

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,960
which are the best frameworks, what's taken as given, I mean, supply and

84
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,240
demand curves, they haven't been peer reviewed, the exponential growth

85
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,360
curve for an economy that was never peer reviewed. But it's just taken as a

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,400
foundational assumption now. So it's much harder to move away from that

87
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,600
system because everything and if we knew paradigms, well, has it been

88
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
peer reviewed? So I think that's why we see the build up of new economic

89
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
thinking often outside major economics departments because the new

90
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,440
thinking is coming from elsewhere rather than within. But what thrills me is

91
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,120
that students in high school, whether they're, you know, 14 year olds or

92
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,480
whether they're 18 year olds or whether they're undergraduates or

93
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,880
master students, they know that the ideas that will serve them to be

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,920
economists, household managers, right? Planetary scale, household managers

95
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,440
of the future, they know that the ideas that will serve them are not the ones

96
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,400
that are contained only in those textbooks, they are coming to these

97
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,080
new ideas.

98
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:14,000
So I taught for eight years a class called Reality 101. And in my

99
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,920
experience, the students that had never had an economics class, like

100
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,240
immediately got the content in my class. But it was the ones that had had an

101
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,560
economics class that there was this like mental speed bump they had to get

102
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,600
over on the assumptions and other things. It was very interesting to

103
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,160
observe.

104
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,280
Yeah, and there's a great quote from Cain, he said something like, it's not

105
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,160
the new ideas that are difficult. It's getting the old ones out of our heads

106
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,720
that have been ramified into the corner of our minds. How do we escape

107
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:50,200
paradigms? So that to me is why I care most about, let's call it Econ 101, I

108
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,520
care most about the first course that any student encounters, often

109
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,200
professors, when they're pushing back against what I'm doing, they say, Oh,

110
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,200
you know, you're just talking about Econ 101. I mean, it gets far more

111
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:06,000
sophisticated than this. I would argue it doesn't, they don't suddenly bring

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
the planet in when you're when you're a master student or something. But the

113
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,240
very first encounter we have with what is the economy, what is the range of

114
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,000
its scope? What are the foundational metrics? Is it price in the market? What

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,120
are the foundational institutions that we care about? These profoundly shape our

116
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,280
worldviews and pictures profoundly shape our worldviews. That's what I've

117
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,840
really learned, the power of pictures. And so if you want to dislodge a model, I

118
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,360
think the best way is to propose a new model, right, Buckminster Fuller, right?

119
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,800
You change things by making the old model obsolete, propose something new. So

120
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,800
that's why the work I've done is really focused on proposing new pictures,

121
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,600
because the power of our visual sight, going into our visual cortex, it really

122
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,880
shapes what we see and what we don't see, what's central, what's peripheral. So

123
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,080
that's to me, the most important economics course to change.

124
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,560
Well, let's let's get into that. Your very popular book, Donut Economics,

125
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:08,120
highlighted the outer core, or the outer ring, which is the planetary boundaries

126
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,240
that we don't want to exceed. And then the inner ring was the human needs for

127
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,960
well being, the things that we don't want to go below. And in it, talking about

128
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:27,440
visuals and orthodox economics, you outlined a list of old economic thinking

129
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,320
like 20th century and new 21st century economics. And maybe you could either

130
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,280
visually or we could put up one of your graphics, just give a kind of a brief

131
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,800
summary of the, I think you had seven points.

132
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,600
Yeah. So first of all, let me say that it was really important to me what I was

133
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,000
aiming to do in that book was to set out ways of thinking, right? It's principles

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,240
of thinking that will then be adapted over time between different countries that

135
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:58,360
will be relevant differently in Malawi or Sweden, but also that'll change over

136
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,320
time as suddenly AI appears or as crises hit. So I wasn't trying to say these are

137
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,960
other policies that we should implement, but rather, what are some of the ways of

138
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,000
thinking that will equip us to go well? And I'm sure there's many more. But yeah,

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,480
here's seven. And I'm just for the fun of it with you. I'm going to see if I can

140
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,080
show them quickly visually. This is going to be kind of like a doughnut economics

141
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,600
circus big tent. So let's see if I can do this. So seven ways to think the first

142
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,440
one, change the goal. The goal of 20th century economics was endless growth,

143
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,440
right? There we go. Endless growth curve. It was just implicitly underlying

144
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,240
everything that we said we were aiming for, success of the economy. No, that is

145
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,520
not a sufficient statement of what success looks like. And we know that

146
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,560
endless growth actually takes us into a lot of problems. So we need, here we go,

147
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,880
the doughnut that you just described, a goal that says, leave no one falling

148
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,000
short in the hole, but don't overshoot Earth's limits. Get everybody over the

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
social foundation inside the ecological ceiling. We want to meet the needs of all

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,280
people within the means of the living planet. It's a goal that brings together

151
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,280
human rights and ecological integrity. And I say, okay, that's the starting point

152
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,320
on day one. Bang, this is where we begin. What kind of economic system will

153
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,120
actually take us there? So number one, change the goal. Two, see the big picture,

154
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,080
right? If that's the compass, what's the map? The map of economics. All mainstream

155
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:23,200
economics courses start with this little diagram, supply and demand. Now, that's a

156
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
big act to put supply and demand on the screen on day one. It means we put the

157
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
market at the center of our vision. It means we make price, the metric of

158
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,920
concern, and everything that falls outside the price contract gets called an

159
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,760
externality. That's a big framing choice of the death of the living world. Oh, it's

160
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,640
an environmental externality. That is not nearly a big enough picture. There are

161
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,120
no externalities, as Herman Daley and I would say. Your model is just not big

162
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,560
enough. So I drew a diagram. Here's my embedded economy diagram. Here you go.

163
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,600
Let's see if we can show this. So this brings together ecological economics. It

164
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,840
brings together complexity. It brings together feminist economics and

165
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,720
common thinking. The economy is embedded in society, is embedded in the living

166
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,480
world. It is a subsystem and utterly dependent upon it. But also the economy

167
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
is made up not just of the market in the state, that very 20th century boxing

168
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,520
match, the household, the space of unpaid caring work, typically done by women, and

169
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,040
the commons and an Ostrom space where we co-create goods and services of value. If

170
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
we start with this big picture of the economy and recognize that all economic

171
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,840
activity has to operate within the planetary boundaries and we can use

172
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,360
these different forms of provisioning, to me this is just so much a richer

173
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,400
starting point for all macroeconomic modeling. So number two, change, get

174
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,040
the big picture. Number three, nurture human nature. Who is humanity? How do we

175
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,360
tell ourselves the story of who we are in this picture? The portrait of

176
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,560
humanity. In 20th century economics, this guy, here we are, he's framed. This is

177
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,960
a rational economic man. I decided to draw him to make him visible. He would be

178
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,760
a man standing alone, no dependence. He's got money in his hand, he's got ego in

179
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
his heart, he's got calculator in his head, and he'd have nature at his feet. He

180
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,960
hates work, he loves luxury, he knows the price of everything. The real problem

181
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:17,360
with this depiction is that the more the students told, oh yes, this model is a

182
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:23,040
sufficient model of us. Actually, we start to mimic him. Students say over time

183
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,880
they more value competition and self-interest over altruism and

184
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,040
collaboration because they start to mimic the model. So who we tell ourselves we

185
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,320
are, shapes who we become. Instead of this rational economic man, we need to

186
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,520
recognize we are first the most social of all mammals. We are social, we are

187
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,160
adaptable, we are heuristic, we care about other's opinions, we follow the

188
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,960
crowd, we are learning. So we have to start with the reality of humanity, which

189
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,600
we learned from cognitive behavior, psychology, from sociology, a much richer

190
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,160
picture of humanity. Now before, we've got to get savvy with systems. So instead

191
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:06,080
of assuming the economy is in equilibrium, like that supply and demand curve

192
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,480
showed us, recognize that it's almost probably never going to be there. It's a

193
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,440
complex adaptive system. For this, my favorite shape, little donut, springs into

194
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,440
a complex adaptive system of interlinked dynamics, reinforcing feedback, balancing

195
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,240
feedback, tipping points, delay, resilience, redundancy. That's the world of

196
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,360
D'Nelamedo's. So think of it as a complex adaptive system that will ever be

197
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,280
evolving. We can't control it. There's no levers to pull. The best we can hope for

198
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:38,120
is to steward that system. So how do we want to steward that system? We want to

199
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:43,640
steward it away from being deeply divisive. We've inherited a divisive

200
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,760
economy that captures value and opportunity in the hands of a few. Here's

201
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,800
the rise of the 1%. We need to turn it, steward that system into a much more

202
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,960
distributive economy. There we go. A system that shares value and opportunity

203
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,080
with all who co-create it. How can we make a distributive economy? So from

204
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,600
divisive to distributive, second big dynamic that we can steward in this

205
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,280
complex adaptive system is from linear and degenerative, stick it in the pipe

206
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,080
of production, make staff throw it away. That's what pushes us over plentary

207
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,280
boundaries into a circular or cyclical regenerative economy where we use

208
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,480
resources again and again from a collectively, carefully, creatively

209
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,040
and slowly. So from degenerative to regenerative, from divisive to

210
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,600
distributive. And then this takes us to the seventh principle that what is the

211
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,440
future of economic growth? What does the future look like? And I'm coming

212
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,480
back to where we began. The presumption was economies would just keep growing

213
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,080
forever. This says, well, maybe actually we need to be agnostic about growth

214
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:48,440
because what we really want are regenerative economies and distributive

215
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,680
economies. And there might come some point, indeed, they probably have already

216
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,440
come to it, especially in high-income economies where they need to grow up,

217
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,680
right? Nothing in nature succeeds by growing forever. It goes through a

218
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,560
growth phase and then it grows up and matures. What would it mean to create

219
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,920
economies that actually mature? Because if we don't do that, we're going to get

220
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,960
that. We're going to induce collapse, which is something very close to your

221
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,680
heart and focus and thoughts, right? So how can we not break? How can we bend?

222
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,960
How can we bend this system so that actually matures and grows up? So those

223
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,720
are the seven ways to think. And let me just say again, that's just seven. Those

224
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,800
are the ones that became really clear and obvious to me. I bet there's more.

225
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,680
And I offer people to keep adding to them.

226
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,520
Bravo.

227
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,720
That was fun.

228
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:39,480
I might have to make this entire interview a best of clip. That was very

229
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,680
impressive. Thank you so much for your work. While you were doing that, I

230
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,440
wondered if you hadn't chose being an economist, you could have been like a

231
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,240
stand-up comedian. And this stuff is not funny, though. That's the problem,

232
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,920
right? You have such a good delivery and are clearly very knowledgeable and

233
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:03,320
passionate. But these are really serious topics that we need to pass the baton

234
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,720
to our youth and people all around the world. And yeah, it feels good because

235
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:16,120
we're on the right side of the ledger of humanity and the biosphere. But we're

236
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:24,160
in a very tough moment. And what you just described, I just fantasize about

237
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,680
leaders when Danela Meadows was working on these things in the 70s, had we

238
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,160
adopted some of this thinking then, but we were in the thralls of massive

239
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,000
energy surplus. The thing that I would add to your list is economics has

240
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:49,320
focused on cost, not value. And energy for what we pay for, just the cost of

241
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,520
extraction, gives orders of magnitude more value to the human enterprise than

242
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,800
its cost. That's a big flag in economic theory.

243
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,520
I think for me, what comes very clearly from your work is if I was to go back

244
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,600
and add to what I wrote about a little bit, but more that the fundamental

245
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,960
currency of our economies, if we really want to get down to currency and

246
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,200
evaluation, energy is the second law of thermodynamics. It's the fundamental

247
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,640
currency of life. And so we would do a lot, we would do really well to pay a lot

248
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,440
more attention to energy. Exactly as you just said, it's treated in economics as

249
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,680
a cost and it's, well, it's been very low. But actually to understand energy and

250
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,760
materiality, and I mean materials, the actual real materials of the world and

251
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,960
the relationship between energy use and material use and its boundedness and

252
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,160
its relationship between that and the delicate balance of the ecosystems,

253
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:51,520
the planetary boundaries, the life support systems of Earth, to understand

254
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,080
the interrelatedness of those things, coming back to a point Satish Kumar

255
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:00,120
from makes, how can you claim to be an economist if you don't yet understand

256
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:04,160
ecology, the living world, the systems on which we depend, the cycles on which we

257
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:09,080
depend, the materials at hand, it's a deeply physical and energy based system.

258
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,000
I've been using this new chart, I'll send it to you after we're done a little

259
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,120
triangle that shows politics, money and technology as describing society. But

260
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,760
then you blow up the screen and that's just a little triangle on the top and

261
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,520
underneath it is this huge energy like flame. And that's underpinning all that.

262
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,760
And then you blow it up even further and underneath that is the biosphere and

263
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:41,200
the ecosystem services of Earth that support all of that. So I mean, what is

264
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:47,880
the response from standard economists at your school at Oxford or around the

265
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,920
world? Are they ignoring this message from donut economics or are they

266
00:19:53,920 --> 00:20:00,120
ridiculing it or I mean it just seems like so much obvious common sense. Or

267
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,000
do they secretly agree with you but the incentive structures of status and

268
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,360
tenure and jobs preclude them from publicly agreeing with you?

269
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:16,000
So when my book first came out in 2017, there was a lot of ignore. That's the

270
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,600
first line of defense, isn't it right? If something's threatening, either

271
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,840
ignore or kill it sort of. And so there's also some ridicule. Or the first

272
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,120
comeback was this isn't economics. Now, oh, no, no, you've put your values in

273
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,600
here. You see by starting with the donut by starting with human rights and

274
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,400
ecological, you started with your values, which astounded me. Maybe wait, when

275
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,840
you start with supply and demand of the market, do you think you're starting

276
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:46,240
with no values? Do you not realize that everything is starting with a set of

277
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,480
values of what we choose to show, what we choose to measure and what we choose

278
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:56,480
to call success. But I have to say there are of course there are, well, the

279
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,840
ecological economists started using it immediately because it brought a visual

280
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,400
to what they and the inheritors of Herman Daley's work have been doing for

281
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,680
decades. Feminist economists, urban studies. So outside of economics

282
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,080
departments, many, many other people started using it business schools

283
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,400
because business happens in the world in the materiality of climate impacts and

284
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,520
labor, labor issues. So it made sense to them. And increasingly, there are

285
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,920
people teaching economics in mainstream departments who more and more, I mean, I

286
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,040
only find out about it when I find out about it, right? You only know what you

287
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,480
know, hear of, who get in touch and say, I'm introducing this into my macro

288
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,960
economics class. Partly, I think, because there's a generation of students

289
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,240
coming through who put up their hand and say, what about planetary boundaries?

290
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,440
What about the donut? The demand is coming from the students. That's more

291
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,000
and more where I see that it's come into economics departments because the

292
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,560
student body are born in, you know, the climate strikers are now at

293
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,200
university. And I see that in the group of students I teach myself. And so

294
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,200
they're coming with a much more political economy expectation of their

295
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,000
education and they're expecting to be taught tools that will actually

296
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,800
equip them with the crisis that they've been born into. So they are pushing

297
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,760
that agenda in a really positive way. But I, instead of trying to hammer on

298
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,600
the door of economics departments that are shut, I've never done that. I go

299
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,640
where the energy is, where the interest is, because there's lots of it. And it's

300
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,120
in other departments that are grounded in real world challenges. Like I said,

301
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,440
like urban design, urban studies, architects, doctors actually, doctors

302
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,360
who recognize human health and planetary health are deeply into woven. They're

303
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,600
bringing it into their degrees. So I'm just going with that energy. And I

304
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,080
believe economics, it's a question to economics. Are you, is economics

305
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,680
going to catch up and embed itself in the real world as other disciplines

306
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:45,200
are doing? And then it will start bringing this in as it is already

307
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:45,840
creeping in.

308
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:54,400
Personally, I don't think economics will ever voluntarily give up the throne. I

309
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,000
think we'll have to have a crisis. And then new ideas that are laying around

310
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,600
will replace the the brittle and outdated 20th century models. Perhaps yours

311
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,120
would be one of them. But I don't think they're going to say, Yeah, you know

312
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:14,400
what, Kate's right. That's just not the way of human status and metabolism. I

313
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:14,960
don't think

314
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,200
I agree. And that but what I do know is they're going to be crises and

315
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,000
they're coming and more and more that these crises come that and I think it's

316
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,000
in part why the donut framework. Oh, yeah, there we are. This speaks to food

317
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,480
prices and energy and climate impacts. And it it holds that space. But as you

318
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,680
just in passing quoted Milton Friedman, right, when when crises come, people

319
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,360
turn to the ideas that are lying around at the time. And I like to say, Well, why

320
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,800
just leave them lying around? Let's have them up and running. And that's why I

321
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,480
co founded donut economic Action Lab. Because when my book came out, what

322
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
thrilled me was that I was approached by people who say, I like the ideas. And I

323
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,920
want to do this. Some of them were teachers in school, I'm teaching this to

324
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,040
the kids now it's not the syllabus, but this is what they should be learning.

325
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:04,120
Some of them were city councillors, city mayors, state legislators, we want to

326
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,640
put this into practice where we are. So we work with them to start seeding this

327
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,320
possibility. And what does it look like when they actually try and start putting

328
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,400
these ideas into practice so that as crises come, we can say like as of today,

329
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,880
I can say there are 70 city and local state district governments around the

330
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,520
world who've already chosen to start working with this model to bring about

331
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,560
the transition that they know they want to create this seeds and grounds proof of

332
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:33,800
practice of a concept so that as crisis hit, it's it's got that credibility, it's

333
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,080
got that critical mass of actual practical use.

334
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,600
Yeah, so my podcast and my work is still mostly about educational, but you're

335
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,640
actually taking doughnut economics, the book, the concepts and putting them into

336
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:55,200
practice in your lab. You just mentioned 70 communities, cities around the world

337
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,640
like, how are they putting them into practice? Can you give some example or

338
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,960
progress updates or interesting stories?

339
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
So I can give you an example and that those 70 are of local governments.

340
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:11,120
There's a whole other group of community organizations starting it up, but local

341
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,520
governments. So the way it, having watched it from it began in April 2020 in the

342
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:21,600
height of the COVID crisis, Amsterdam, we created a city portrait for them

343
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,760
downscaling the doughnut to the city. What would it mean for this city to aim to

344
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,520
live in the doughnut? And they launched it in the midst of COVID because they said,

345
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,360
well, we're in emergency, we're in a crisis right now. But as we emerge from

346
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,720
crisis, they will be funding, the economy will be opening up again. It's that

347
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,400
question, which direction are we going to go in, right? Don't waste the

348
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,160
opportunity for crisis to change your direction. They introduced it at the

349
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,720
heart of their policy to become a circular city. So they said, they had a

350
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,640
vision to create 100% circular by 2050, 50% circular by 2030. And they

351
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,720
recognize that circularity doesn't just mean changing the flow of materials,

352
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,680
it's not merely materials, it has deep implications for livelihoods, for

353
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:04,240
distribution, for people's access to transport and food and clothing. So they

354
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,640
wanted to bring the social in, and that's why they saw the doughnut really help

355
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,840
bring together the ecological and social in terms of a bigger vision of a

356
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,360
circularity policy. And that was a good example of a place that already has a

357
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,200
vision for transformation, put it together with their vision to get rid of all

358
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,120
fossil fuel transport in the city by 2030. So they're really transforming

359
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,960
some big systems here. The doughnut serves as a visual clear compass that

360
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,120
brings it all together. And so often that's the way I see it happening. It's

361
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,040
not as if, you know, city mayor sees the doughnut says, oh, that's an amazing

362
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,880
idea. Now what shall we do? It's going to be seen by people in places who

363
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,240
already have this sense of we need to transition, we need to transform our

364
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,800
systems, our energy, our transport, our housing, our food systems. They come

365
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,440
across the doughnut. This really helps bring together these ideas in a clear

366
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,600
way that we can communicate. And it's like a big sale on our ship. It's very

367
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,880
compelling vision. And also we're joining others doing it. I've just come back

368
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,400
from Cunobl in France, where the city have one of the most recent cities to

369
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,320
say, yep, we're adopting the doughnut. So they they downscale it to the

370
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,160
national level, I mean, to the city level. And they actually collect the

371
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,040
metrics. What would it mean for everybody here to thrive? And is our local

372
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,600
ecology thriving? Do we have thriving nature in the city? Are we coming back

373
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,760
with implantary boundaries? And what's our impact on people worldwide through

374
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,480
global supply chains? And what kind of metrics could we collect? So that this

375
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,840
replaces, for example, saying, I'm making the stat up. But for example, they

376
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,080
might say, oh, you know, good knobs, GDP is increased by 1.3% over the last

377
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,080
year. I mean, is that is that good or bad? Or what? How will I know anything

378
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,560
from that? But if I'm measuring the metrics of a place in real terms, in

379
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,440
terms of people's lives, in terms of the ecological health and its impact in

380
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,160
the world, it's, it's a real story and a much more detailed story about what's

381
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:03,120
happening here. So they've introduced it. They're like many cities transforming

382
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:08,800
their transport systems, getting reducing cars, bringing in public transit, and

383
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,120
much more cycling. They've introduced a tax on property, actually, because they

384
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,880
said we have huge inequality in our city, we need to reduce the inequalities. So

385
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,760
this is a quite an elected local government with pretty progressive

386
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,760
mandate that are saying, yeah, this helps us go in that direction. And just in

387
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,000
terms of the kinds of actions that I see when I go to cities like Karnob, like

388
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,880
Barcelona, like Copenhagen, what recurs to me again and again is a beautiful

389
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,200
phrase that the environmental journalist George Mombio once wrote. He wrote

390
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,560
about the UK. He said, look, what we have here is private luxury and public

391
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,360
squalor. And what we need is public luxury and private

392
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,680
sufficiency. And when I go to places like these cities, I see, ah, yeah, this is

393
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,720
what public luxury looks like, fantastic public parks, incredible mobility, low

394
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:05,040
cost, fast, clean, efficient transport, good quality social housing.

395
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:08,080
And we have private sufficiency. And in France, there's a word that's really

396
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,680
gaining currency, sobriety. If you say sobriety in English, people think, oh,

397
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:14,560
you're not going to drink alcohol anymore. It's got that very literal meaning.

398
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:20,320
But sobriety in France means a dignified sense of I have enough. This is

399
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,840
sufficient. My material needs are met. My mind and my intellectual life and my

400
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,080
cultural and common's life is flourishing. But sobriety, it's a, it's a,

401
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,360
it's really interesting to see the way this is gaining traction. In Sweden, they

402
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,240
have a term lagom, which means I have plenty and it's enough. And we need

403
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,560
language like this in more and more cultures to be able to express that

404
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,240
sense of private sufficiency and public luxury. And that's where we should be

405
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,760
seeking abundance. So again and again, I see cities that are actually starting to

406
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,120
put this into practice. That's the vision that they're starting to bring about.

407
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,280
I love it. I have so many questions. So here's, here's the challenge that I see.

408
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:04,400
Last week, I was in Germany and I spoke to a large audience of climate, energy,

409
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,040
tech investors with the basic messages, we're not going to solve climate change

410
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:14,240
and help the environment by growing the economy by electric cars and things like

411
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,120
that. And I expected it to not go well, but it went really well. And

412
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,680
like this is a Dinella Meadows thing. You can't understand our situation unless

413
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,920
you look at the whole system. And the people in the room, I told them they

414
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:38,160
were wearing three hats. One was their hat as the managers of the Sovereign Wealth Fund of

415
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,560
Norway or Fidelity or whatever, where they have to generate returns for their investors. The other

416
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:51,760
hat was their father, mother, sister, parents, whatever, they want to do the right thing for

417
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,680
their family. And then the third thing is they want to do the right thing for the world as a

418
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:03,440
citizen of the world. The challenges is that our prices and our incentives and our cultural

419
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:12,880
aspirations are having them focus on that first hat, where there is not a common plan of action

420
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,360
where all three of those hats can align. And I would imagine that if we had better prices

421
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,760
on non-renewable inputs, if we had a complementary metric to GDP, because I think GDP does

422
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,160
still have some uses, but if there was a well-being metric attached to it for context,

423
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,480
and then suddenly all of your book and all of your seven points would scale massively. But until

424
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,280
that happens, the incentives and the prices that basically we just pay for the cost of extraction,

425
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:57,360
not the cost of creation or pollution on our main goods, are not going to allow communities and

426
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,520
cities and nations to embrace this writ large. What are your thoughts on that?

427
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,120
So I love those three hats. I think many people are realizing over time that those

428
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,360
second and third hats, I want to be a good parent and I want to be a good citizen of the world,

429
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,960
these are coming much, much closer together. So I have 14-year-old twins. If I imagine what will

430
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,040
the world be like when they are 80 or 90, then I believe there's nothing I can do to protect them

431
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:31,520
that doesn't actually involve protecting the world because we utterly depend upon a thriving world.

432
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,120
So if you want to be a good parent, you need to care for the whole world and system. As Jeanine

433
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,880
Beniaz always beautifully says, you know, a species and a platter or an animal can't be around for

434
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,120
10,000 generations, so it takes care of the place that will take care of its offspring,

435
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:54,480
and that's the best we can do. I completely agree that the incentives for the manager of a, well,

436
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,640
Norway's sovereign wealth fund, there's a lot of realigning to do that. But if any major corporate

437
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,480
designed company, the incentives are way off. So just to come directly to your point about prices,

438
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,520
yes, the price incentives are way out. I would fix it not only through changing prices, but

439
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,920
this will also change prices through changing regulations. So I really believe, you know,

440
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,240
I don't think you're advocating, you know, set the right price and the quantity will fix itself.

441
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,320
Like, I really like what Amsterdam are doing. They're just saying, in 2020, they said,

442
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,800
in 10 years time, in 2030, there will be no fossil fuel vehicles in the city, no boats, no cars.

443
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:35,840
So guys get, you've got a long, loud legal message. It's very clear this is the transformation that's

444
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,480
happening. So nobody changed the price on that day, but they changed all the signals. And of course,

445
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,800
that has knock on effects of changing all the future expected price. So we need to put in

446
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,920
place regulations that just remove life-destroying chemistry and introduce only life-friendly

447
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,840
chemistry that just remove fossil fuels from the system. And so that we put in that long,

448
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:58,080
loud legal message that the system will start to adapt. But I also want to come back to the

449
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,920
point you say that the managers are not facing the right incentives. We can change the prices

450
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:11,120
that they face, the incentives around them. We can also change the deep design of the

451
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:17,040
organizations they work for. And one more piece of puppet show. This to me is a really key one.

452
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,280
And in fact, you know, if I could go back and rewrite a section of joint economics,

453
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,160
this is one thing that I would bring up much more clearly. And it comes from the work of

454
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,560
Marjorie Kelly, who's a next generation enterprise designer working for the Democracy

455
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:36,640
Collaborative in the US. Marjorie's book that I read, Regenerative Ownership, she, or owning

456
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:41,360
our future, it's called, she said, you know, you need to look at the deep design of an enterprise.

457
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,800
So here's the five deep design traits, right? What is the purpose of this enterprise?

458
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,720
Why does it even exist? What is it in service of in the world? How is it networked with its

459
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,200
employees, its suppliers, its customers, its industry allies? What relationships does it

460
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,040
hold? Does it see everybody else as a competitor or the allies in transformation? How is it

461
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,400
governed? Who's at the table who has voice and decision making? What are the metrics?

462
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,200
How is it owned by shareholders, by a family for 300 years, by venture capital, by the workers,

463
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,400
by the state, because how its own is going to profoundly shape how it's financed,

464
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,920
where that finance is coming from, and what therefore it's expecting or extracting or demanding?

465
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,520
And so is it, is the governance ownership and finance going to be in line with

466
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,600
maximizing returns to the owners, which is a very 20th century corporate design,

467
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,520
or is it actually going to be in line with serving the purpose, which might be sequestering carbon,

468
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,920
building community, creating health? So to me, if I was looking around that room,

469
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,600
I would say, yeah, you're wearing a hat of the manager of the fund and strapped to your body

470
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,280
is a structural design that is informing what you can and can't do, what doesn't,

471
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,440
doesn't have materiality in your decision making, so in addition to prices. And how can we change

472
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,760
these deep designs of institutions? So at Donatee Economic Section Lab, we're working with companies

473
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,280
that many companies come to us and say, oh, we want to do business in the donut. We say, fine,

474
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,920
we don't want to talk about the design of your products. I'm sure they're very nice. We don't

475
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:07,440
want to talk about the design of that. We want to talk about the design of your company, because

476
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,720
this is ultimately going to determine whether or not your company can become regenerative

477
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,960
and distributive of the value it creates, sharing that value with all those through the supply chain

478
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,360
rather than maximizing returns to the owners, the shareholders, or not, whether it's stuck in an old

479
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:27,760
pattern. Because what we find when we talk to companies, I'll give you one example. I was at

480
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,440
a circular economy conference last summer and somebody came up to me and she said, you know,

481
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,400
I, she worked for a major clothing company. She said, I'm head of regenerative clothing,

482
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,560
and I've been asked to, or the sustainability, I've been asked to come up with a line of regenerative

483
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,040
clothing for our company to signal we're part of this revolution. But I'm being told I have to

484
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,200
generate 15% profit returns or profit margins on it from the get go, the standard. There's absolutely

485
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,760
no room for this transformation. She said, it's impossible. I cannot do it. So these companies

486
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,120
want the regenerative label, the regenerative, but they want the bottom line because of the

487
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,880
way they're designed and owned and financed. We need to change that deep design.

488
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:18,160
So, okay, I'm with you on that, except our entire edifice is supported by the

489
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,960
one-time endowment of the carbon pulse. So I don't know in donut economics and the planetary

490
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:34,560
boundaries, it seems like we're avoiding exceeding nitrogen, CO2, you know, biodiversity limits,

491
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:39,760
and that these communities are responding because they, they don't want to exceed those and they're

492
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,160
making like Grenoble and those other places you talked about. How much of it is in response to

493
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:54,960
not publicly aware yet, but anticipated depletion of these energy helpers that we get annually the

494
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,360
equivalent of 500 billion human laborers worth of energy that we're just pulling from the ground?

495
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:09,360
Because as a corporation that wants to make regenerative clothing and needs to make 15%

496
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:14,560
a year, if you get these cheap fossil helpers, that's going to help you meet your bottom line

497
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,880
a lot easier. So how do we manage that? How does that fit into the story here?

498
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:30,320
Well, as you said, this one of carbon pulse, it's, it's got a pulse away, right? Whether it's

499
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,160
through peak or whether the evident impacts in the world we need to let go of it and that's the

500
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,640
heart of your work, what happens next. I agree that, so going back to the way economics is taught,

501
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,160
we are not taught economics saying, here you are on any course in the early 21st century,

502
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,800
by the way, you're studying economics at the end of a one off massive carbon pulse,

503
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,520
which has created abnormal temporary conditions, one of which the most important of which is

504
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,080
because of the availability of cheap energy, it's given us phenomenal uplift of growth.

505
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,160
And we've come to think that was normal and we, right, we need to be aware that that was

506
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:16,720
historic and that's not the future. So how do we move away from that? That's why I think it's

507
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,960
important to question growth, but I want to come back and question the design of the company,

508
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,200
because the way these companies are designed, they're designed on the presumption of growth

509
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,760
and therefore the, the, you know, the planet may be, the planet may be going to hand the

510
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,880
handcuff, but I want my 15% and that's still deeply written into the mindset, you know,

511
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,040
this coming out of the financial community, right? I want my high returns that, and that hasn't

512
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:46,800
modified at all in terms of the reality of what can actually be regenerated on a planet that

513
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,720
isn't depending on the extraordinary free cheap labor of fossil fuel, but actually comes back

514
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,640
within the regenerative capacity of renewable energies. To me, that's the, that, that's your,

515
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:05,600
that's your question. Are we, are we going to get this before it breaks us? Will we get this and

516
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,400
learn to bend? And for me, part of the bending is bending in the design of institutions. So we

517
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,280
create companies that don't depend upon endless growth. They understand that they may grow until

518
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:21,600
they're mature in size and scale, but then they can thrive and they're not owned in ways that

519
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:27,360
continually expect to extract surplus profit because it's not going to come. It needs to be

520
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:31,760
reinvested in the enterprise, which is invested in regenerating the world.

521
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,080
You first need to understand it before you can do it. So this is very important, I think. One of my

522
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,960
first podcast guests was Danella Meadows, husband, Dennis Meadows, and when asked what are some of

523
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:53,280
the pathways forward, he's like one of the prerequisites is to extend the time horizons

524
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:59,360
of institutions from quarterly or yearly to five years or 10 years or 20 years.

525
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,720
So there's something that some friends of mine are working on called the long-term stock exchange,

526
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:13,280
which is to duly list current companies on this long-term stock exchange, which makes decisions

527
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,600
for all three hats that I mentioned earlier simultaneously, because otherwise we're just

528
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:27,680
in this short term have to get the 15% now. We can't look at the impact on the planet and

529
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,120
depletion and these other things. So maybe that's one of the pathways.

530
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,200
Yeah. So I'm going to come back here. Whenever I hear an innovation like that, I come back here

531
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,040
and I think, which bit of this deep design of the enterprise or its environment are you there for

532
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,200
adapting? So if you've got the long-term stock exchange, is that going to influence how,

533
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,680
how is that going to influence how the company's governed? Are you putting, for example, you could

534
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,440
have, if it's a shareholder and company, you could have shares, you know, different voting

535
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,080
rights for shares that are held over decades or that you're committed to hold for many decades,

536
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,040
so that you give more voting to the long-term view than to the short-term view. Other companies like

537
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,480
Faith and Nature, a shampoo and beauty company, they recently put, literally one of their 11

538
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,400
directors has become nature. They've put nature on the board because they said, we kept asking,

539
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:24,320
what would nature do? Well, let's stop asking this as a sort of hypothetical question. Let's

540
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:30,720
put nature on the board. So nature is represented by an environmental lawyer who says in bringing

541
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,800
naturally a long-term view because nature wants to be the infinite game and thrive forever.

542
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,480
So what would nature vote for us to do on the board? So all sorts of changes that go on between

543
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,320
how the company's owned and governed, bringing in innovations like that, I think this is,

544
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,600
this is really where the future of enterprise design lies and what it depends upon, because if we

545
00:42:53,600 --> 00:43:01,440
don't bring that longer-term and wider thinking in terms of nature's interest, the supply chain's

546
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,760
interest, the workers' interest, rather than it being dominated and owned by the interests of

547
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,200
finance, then we're just stuck in a model that's just in service to finance and not in service to

548
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,480
life. And to me, that's essentially what fascinates me with your work is this ultimate question of

549
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,480
what does it look like to design finance that's in service to life, that actually finance that could

550
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,880
contribute to be and be part of a regenerative system? Because the financial system we've created

551
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,840
is exponential and extractive and it's like the antithesis of a living system.

552
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:38,320
I fully agree. And the default trajectory is that the superorganism will eat the doughnut

553
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:48,800
unless things change. So the doughnut is your best known diagram, but you flashed one up earlier,

554
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:57,600
which I think is equally important, is the embedded economy that replaces the circular flow of goods

555
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:06,800
diagram. And in there, you had the household and the commons. And could you unpack that a little bit?

556
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,280
I mean, I assume the household, you're talking about the care economy. And could you expand on the

557
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,880
importance of that and why we need to include that in our metrics, et cetera, going forward?

558
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,520
Yeah. So the importance of, so economy and society in the living world, the importance for me of

559
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,800
dividing the economy up was because the very 20th century economic debate and the kind of the

560
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,040
debate between Milton Friedman and or Hayek and Keynes was very much about the relationship and

561
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,000
the roles of the market and the state. And if you focus in, it's fascinating, but if you focus

562
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,840
only on that, you get this very 20th century ideological boxing match, you know, you're a

563
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:53,040
free market, let's say for a capitalist or your state loving socialist. And in those were the

564
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,120
only two choices. Those are your only two choices, mate. It still goes on today. I mean, I find

565
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,680
extraordinary, particularly in the US, I find if you critique the market, oh, oh, oh, so you're

566
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,200
a communist? Like, is that it? So that's why I like to bring in new framing and not use that

567
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,240
language, just speaking in a different space. So the market and the state, of course, that's

568
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,320
what shows up in GDP. That's the market output of the economy. But the way I think of these four

569
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:26,160
sectors is they are four different ways, really useful ways, each of them, that we provision for

570
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,960
our needs and wants. So we can provision for our needs and wants through market based exchange,

571
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,320
through price based market. Adam Smith was onto something, right? The market is an amazing mechanism

572
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:42,320
with a lot of feedback loops through the price signal, sending messages to buyers and sellers

573
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:48,480
who never need to meet, who through that mechanism provide things that they want to supply and buy.

574
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,160
A couple of caveats, it only serves those who can pay the rest it ignores, and it only values

575
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,160
what's priced the rest it exploits. So big caveats, which is one of the reasons why we

576
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:04,080
obviously need the state, the state provisions, public services, public goods for all,

577
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:09,200
whether it's because it's a natural monopoly or because it's a human right. So we need that.

578
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,880
But this still leaves us in the kind of market state dichotomy in marketed goods.

579
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,080
Many other of our needs and wants are produced and provided through care, through unpaid caring work

580
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:25,760
in the household, where we all begin every day. It's the domain of the cooking, washing, cleaning,

581
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,880
sweeping, raising the kids, teaching them to be good members of society. None of which is included

582
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:38,480
in GDP. None of which, and yet which makes life work and it makes life worth it. And then the

583
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:46,400
Commons, which Ellen Ostrom bought from political science into economics and said, well, how people

584
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,960
collaborate not through markets and not through the state, but as a community, they come together

585
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,640
and co-create goods and services that they value collectively. And this can work very, very well.

586
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:02,480
Garrett Hardin said in the late 60s, oh, the Commons, it's a tragedy. And Ellen Ostrom

587
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,800
come along and says, well, you rift and sort of presume that the Commons is a tragedy. I actually

588
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,800
went and visited some, you know, they actually work really well, rice farmers in Nepal or fishermen

589
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,720
in Maine, and they actually managed to create rules that they follow together, collective

590
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:24,720
discussions, there are punishments for breaking the rules. There are all sorts of codes in place

591
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:30,640
that make the Commons work. So I think all economics should begin, you know, in a classroom

592
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:35,360
with 14 year olds, teach them these ideas and then just say, go out in the street, go out in the

593
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:40,800
street, just look around you. You'll see the market, you'll see the state, you'll see household care,

594
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,080
you'll see the Commons, you'll realize we're immersed in it all, all of the time. And therefore,

595
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:51,840
each one of us is a producer and a consumer. We play a role in markets. We're a citizen and a

596
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:58,880
resident or your parents may be a public servant, they may be a doctor or a teacher or a bureaucrat.

597
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:03,040
We're all immersed in households. What are you doing in a household and what's the

598
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,520
politics of household care? Who's doing that work? And we're all commoners, we're part of a club,

599
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:14,080
part of society. And we suddenly see a much fuller economic view of ourselves. And then you can start

600
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:18,320
talking about power, because there's a power relationship across every one of these lines,

601
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,800
the power between the market and the household. I know in the US, I understand that women have

602
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,680
like how many weeks maternity leave before they have to come back for work? You know,

603
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:33,760
it's just like weeks, whereas in Denmark, it's parental leave a year between both parents.

604
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,000
Very different negotiations of that market household relationship, but power between the

605
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,920
market and the state. Ronald Reagan famously told us to roll back the state, get out of the way.

606
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,240
Margaret Thatcher did the same. And I think we're seeing a lot of the consequences of this kind

607
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:52,240
of market fundamentalism, market crushing out the Commons, market society. Often people say we

608
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,120
live in a market society. And then are we now marketizing our relationship with the living

609
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:01,760
one? That's one of my concerns about bringing a market based economic language of natural

610
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:07,040
capital accounting or ecosystem valuation to the living world. But there's there's relationships,

611
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:11,360
power relationships across all of these lines. And last thing I'll say on this diagram, one of

612
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,920
the most interesting things is when you think about economic provisioning that happens across

613
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,800
these, so the state and the Commons, the state commons partnerships, how can the state be a

614
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:27,200
good partner to the Commons? How can the state support the household with childcare centers,

615
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,120
for example? How can the market and the Commons, you can have platform cooperativism, right? So

616
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,120
you can have a Commons platform and then people can run small market based enterprises on that

617
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:42,000
Commons. So some of the most interesting economic innovations in our economies are happening at

618
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,600
the intersections of these. And if you don't start by seeing them all of them, you'll miss it.

619
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:50,160
And you'll miss out that space of innovation. So yeah, this is this is a kind of base map.

620
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:54,080
If the donor is the compass, the embedded economy diagram is the base map. And it's,

621
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,880
it's a real tribute to Herman Daley, it says, whenever you see a diagram of economy,

622
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,360
you got to draw the living world around it and say, this is a closed system. And this is an

623
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,960
open subsystem, deal with it, create finance and create economic systems that actually

624
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,760
thrive within the dynamics of the living world.

625
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,200
Are you teaching right now, or are you full time with Donut Economics Action Lab and etc?

626
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:25,280
I do teach a little bit in one course in Oxford, but I threw Donut Economics Action Lab through

627
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,440
teaching in Oxford. So I actually, no, let me, let me rewind that. Two days after Herman Daley died,

628
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,760
I was giving a lecture on a kind of critiques of, you know, mainstream economics and new

629
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,720
economics. And some students rushed up to me afterwards and they just said,

630
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,280
why aren't all first year economic students taught these ideas? And there was this kind of

631
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:47,360
real frustration. And I just felt it was, it was because Herman Daley had just died and just this

632
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,000
damn, the baton has really been passed to this generation now. So I just thought,

633
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,600
why the heck isn't it not? So I live in Oxford, I haven't to live in Oxford, I moved here 20

634
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:59,600
years ago to work for Oxfam and here I am. So my local university, Oxford University,

635
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,960
and I, I teach there. And I thought, right, I'm going to put on a course that's open to all students

636
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,240
who come to the city of Oxford, where the Oxford University, Oxford Brooks University,

637
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,080
there are two universities here, to study economics in any kind. And it's free and it's on and it was

638
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:18,480
at night and it was student organized and it was fantastic. And we had 200 students do the whole

639
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,400
thing throughout eight weeks. Now, the reason I did it here in Oxford was to develop the materials

640
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:30,800
that I now want to turn into a course that we can share online with everybody. So part, and this

641
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,000
is my work at Donut Economics Action Lab. How do we, you know, the real question of Donut Economics

642
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,440
Action Lab is how can we put these ideas in the comments? I've now put all the ideas of Donut

643
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,680
Economics in the comments and we share them and we've turned them into tools for cities and tools

644
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,960
for communities and tools for business. We ask only as commoners, we ask that people share back

645
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,280
their learning and their innovation, because that's what means we collectively learn. But part of this

646
00:51:53,280 --> 00:52:00,080
is the future that we plan is to provide more training, provide more courses, and provide the

647
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,920
materials for those courses so that other teachers can then say, great slide deck, thank you very

648
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,440
much. And now I'm going to go and teach that so that it spreads and scales. To me, always the

649
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,240
question is, how do we help these ideas spread and scale at the speed that these times demand? And

650
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:17,520
how do you do that with an openness of sharing, but also an integrity? Making sure the ideas don't

651
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:22,480
get greenwashed along the way. And so it's continually balancing that openness and integrity.

652
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,880
And that's why we're in Action Lab, actually. It's all about putting ideas into action and it's a lab

653
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,000
because the way we are aiming to do it, we're learning along the way as well how to design these

654
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,680
commons well so that they retain integrity, but that they can spread as fast as possible.

655
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,200
And I invite anybody listening to this to come and check out what we're doing at

656
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,560
DonutEconomics.org. You can see our platform, you can join, you can browse, you can use the tools.

657
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:51,520
Please be a good commenter if you use the tools, share back because we know that the peer-to-peer

658
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,440
inspiration, when a mayor says, I'm using this tool in our city, that's just massive inspiration and

659
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,720
has, you know, has directly traceable impacts on other mayors and councillors elsewhere who then

660
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,520
get the inspiration, but also somehow get the permission. It's time to move. Let's go. They're

661
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:12,800
going. Amsterdam's going, Copenhagen, Brussels, Barcelona, Grenoble. It's time to go. Epo in

662
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:19,040
Malaysia, South Hanna Bay in South Africa. We're on the move. If I had taken your class, if I had

663
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,400
been one of those 200 when I was 18 years old, it would have completely transformed my entire life.

664
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,360
Well, I think if I had taken Reality 101 with you and in many students, it would transform many,

665
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,120
many lives. And I think these are the foundational courses that a lot of students,

666
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:41,360
again, as I said, born into climate crisis, born into an era of awareness of global North South,

667
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,600
Black Lives Matter and born into a much critical, much more critical awareness of the inequities

668
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:50,640
thrown up by the systems we've created. They are looking for these tools that will help them

669
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,800
transform the future and at the very least steer through the future that they know crisis is coming

670
00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,720
and we need resilience. So yes, let's spread these ideas, you know, through podcast and through

671
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:05,920
online courses to make them available as possible. I get no greater thrill than when a teacher writes

672
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,840
to me on Twitter and says, I'm using these ideas and I'm teaching them in my class and it's like,

673
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:16,560
go, let's go. This is big team work. And we create a big team when we share and feedback and that

674
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:20,080
lovely feeling of, I mean, I'm part of a really big team and I don't even know the names of all

675
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:24,640
my teammates, but we're doing this together. Well, you're part of the right team. That's even more

676
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:32,000
important on behalf of nature and the future. If I can help you in any way on that, obviously,

677
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:36,880
we're doing this podcast, but let's continue talking offline because I think what you're

678
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:45,600
doing is so important. You just mentioned inequalities. I know that wealth inequality is

679
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:54,160
something that you often talk about. It seems that income and wealth inequality are incompatible with

680
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:01,440
what you envision to be a successful doughnut economy. Do you think that ecologically and

681
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:09,040
biophysically responsible societies need to go hand in hand with more materially equitable

682
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:16,800
societies? Yes, definitely. I mean, here's the doughnut. Here's the overshooting and shortfall

683
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,160
doughnut. So all the red in the middle is the extent to which people worldwide are falling

684
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,240
short on essential needs and the outside is the extent to which we're overshooting planetary

685
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:29,600
boundaries. Actually, it's been updated and the 2022 data would show even more red here. We're

686
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:36,880
overshooting even more. So the scale of inequality in the world is just gobsmacking.

687
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,960
The richest 1% of people own half of the world's wealth. I can't actually, in my head,

688
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:52,240
hold that as the scale of inequalities that has. There's no way we can meet the needs of all people

689
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:59,040
within the means of planetary boundaries in such an inequality because we need a massive redistribution

690
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:05,280
of resources and access to resource for all these people who literally don't have food,

691
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:11,440
health, education, housing, transport. We need to see the most economic growth and the most

692
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:15,600
well-being growth in the lowest income countries. That's where I absolutely believe that economies,

693
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,560
if we measure them in traditional way, GDP, they will grow. Malawi people there live on

694
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:26,160
an average $1,500 per person per year, massive human shortfall. We need to see that growth.

695
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:32,720
And the only way that that's going to be possible with the planetary limits is for those who have

696
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:37,440
very large material footprints now, which are very heavily coupled with high incomes,

697
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:43,280
to come back with influential boundaries. So creating a far more equitable world globally

698
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:49,280
and also within nations is an essential part of making it even feasible to think about coming

699
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,520
with influential boundaries. So yes, they have to be brought together. And many people I know

700
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,960
when they talk about the concept of a regenerative economy would say, well, a far more equitably

701
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:06,880
distributed economy is part of that. A regenerative system cannot thrive and continue if it's deeply

702
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,240
unequal. And I would agree. The reason I, in my book, and in these seven principles, I pulled

703
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,920
them out. I said, I want to just distinguish between or highlight that as well as from degenerative

704
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:24,240
to regenerative, from divisive to distributive, because I came working at Oxfam for a decade.

705
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,280
I came very much from a social justice background. And it's really important that the redistributional

706
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:35,280
intention or the predistributional intention is very, very clear. And I think sometimes when

707
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,600
some people hear regenerative and they think, oh, that's just environmental or just ecological,

708
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:44,320
it's really important to say, hang on, we're rebalancing both the ecological imbalances and

709
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:50,080
the social imbalances, and they have to happen together. So yes, crucial. And then it goes back

710
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:56,240
to that lovely phrase from George Monbiot, public luxury, it's accessible to all and

711
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,680
private sufficiency. That is very much a redistributional agenda that would achieve that.

712
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:09,680
I think we evolved with material equality because we didn't have any energy surplus. And now this

713
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:19,600
energy carbon pulse has created this just series of multiple scale power laws. Let me ask you this.

714
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:31,040
Do we need to change the prices and the cultural aspirations before such a wealth transfer would

715
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:39,920
take place? Because if we keep the same GDP as our goal, prices are at the cost of extraction,

716
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:46,640
not their real value, and we do a simultaneous wealth transfer within countries and between

717
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:54,560
countries to the global south, wouldn't that in itself actually accelerate some of the exceedings

718
00:58:54,560 --> 00:59:00,800
of the planetary boundaries? So I think instead of thinking in terms of prices, I was thinking in

719
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:06,960
terms of the actual, that's why I prefer to think in terms of the regulation of saying we are going

720
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:13,520
to eliminate the use of fossil fuels here, whether it's the car or transforming, insulating our homes

721
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:20,640
and moving away from fossil fuel to renewable energy, so that we just bring down that intensive

722
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:26,160
use of fossil fuels and make available the remaining carbon budget to other countries that

723
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:33,920
have massively underused theirs. So let me ask a follow-up question there.

724
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:42,640
There's a lot of built infrastructure and momentum and sunk cost in the global north.

725
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:54,480
Is it possibly more likely that a culture, a community, a region to truly live like

726
00:59:54,480 --> 01:00:05,600
donut economics, minimum human needs and don't exceed planetary boundaries in the global south,

727
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:12,880
in areas that don't have all this infrastructure and sunk cost of expectations and institutions?

728
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:20,400
Would it be easier to start this in Kenya or somewhere? I'm just asking.

729
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,680
Yeah, so, and I think it's a really, really valid question. I think there are two things

730
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,960
pulling in different directions. There is not the sunk cost, there's not the sunk infrastructural

731
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:39,600
structure that's been put in place. You haven't got the intensive road-based culture that, say,

732
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:45,680
North America has been locked into. In the same way that they've jumped from, you know,

733
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,440
no phones to mobile phones, from no banking to e-banking, they've jumped all those institutions

734
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,880
in between. So yes, when there's no infrastructural in place, you can jump to a far better solution

735
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:03,360
and that must be why there's the global north and the world makes available resources to invest

736
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,440
in renewable energy so they jump into renewable energy solutions. So on the one hand, you've got

737
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:13,440
the lack of inherited infrastructure as a barrier. But of course, the other side of is it,

738
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,720
high income countries have so much wealth and resources and technology and skilled people.

739
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:25,600
So they've got the accumulation of wealth in resources that they can either convert or they

740
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:30,800
can use that skill and the institutional structures that enable that to happen. So the idea of saying,

741
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:37,200
you know, oh, this is much easier for Kenya or Malawi, they're on incredibly low incomes and

742
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,120
it would only be easier if we have the transfers that need to happen from the global north to the

743
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:47,200
global south due to historic responsibilities for climate and other ecological resource use

744
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,400
that should be happening. I mean, I think of countries in kind of three clusters

745
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,480
heading towards the donut, there are the low income countries that like the ones we've just

746
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:00,320
been mentioning that need to meet the needs of all people for the first time without overshooting

747
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,000
planetary boundaries in the way that countries before them have done. And that's never been done

748
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,240
before. There's the middle income nations like China and Iran and Mexico and Russia that need to

749
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:14,080
meet people's needs for the first time while already coming back within planetary boundaries.

750
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:18,560
That's never been done before either. And then there's the high income nations that are in massive,

751
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:22,960
all high income nations are overshooting planetary boundaries. If I showed you their

752
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:29,040
national donuts, they're like big red overshoot. So first of all, next time you catch or I catch

753
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:35,200
anybody here or find ourselves saying developed countries, advanced nations like, hang on,

754
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,320
what are you talking about? Because there's absolutely nothing advanced or developed about

755
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:42,480
overshooting planetary boundaries. So we should be reframing our language. But these nations need to

756
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:46,960
reduce and come back within planetary boundaries, not just on carbon, big one,

757
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:53,280
but also on water use, land use, material use, all of those planetary boundaries calming back

758
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,800
within while finally meeting people's needs for the first time, which they definitely have the

759
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:02,160
resources to do. And that is an unprecedented pathway too. So every nation is on a pathway of

760
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,120
transformation. None of it's been done before. Some have the advantage of wealth. Some have

761
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:12,080
the advantage of not being locked in to existing infrastructure and some I think many of the emerging

762
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:17,520
economies, they're in the middle of those big infrastructural investments. And this is the

763
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,320
critical time to get it right. And of course, I think one of the dangers is the fossil fuel industry

764
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:27,280
when they find themselves being closed in the global north, the real risk is that they then

765
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,560
go and sell their wares to the lower income countries to get them locked in. And how do we

766
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:38,080
avoid them getting that lock in instead moving to the renewable energy future that will actually

767
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:42,000
power them and enable them not to get locked into endless growth. They need to grow now,

768
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,360
but not get locked into institutions that drive them to endlessly.

769
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:53,600
So what is the correct term developed world that's creating global ecocide or the global north? I mean,

770
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,240
what is the acceptable term? Do you come up with something?

771
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,880
Yeah, I use just very factual language of high income, middle income and low income,

772
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:06,560
because I'm just describing their income levels. But I think we really need new language because

773
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:09,760
the more that we find ourselves saying, you know, even if people say, well, developed nations,

774
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,640
but you know what I mean by that, it still just keeps creating this idea that that's the aspiration

775
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:20,320
and others should get there. And I find it very powerful when I show national donut diagrams

776
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:25,520
to countries like Norway, you mentioned Norway, but people are whole Norway up in Norway, wonderful

777
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:29,360
life, high income, great quality of air, and you can swim in the harbor, what's not to like.

778
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,520
Norway has a massive ecological overshoot like all high income nations. And when you show them,

779
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,800
these images, and that high income countries are very far from living the donut Costa Rica is much

780
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:45,200
closer than any other nation. There's a real jaw drop moment, actually. And I've seen it visibly

781
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,840
on the face of officials of nations who who used to being considered the top of the ranking. And

782
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:54,880
actually, it really repositions. And there's a humility that kicks in that there's that uh-huh,

783
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:01,600
or maybe it's an oh dear, or gosh, look at us moment, that we need of humility and ambition of we too

784
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:08,560
need to deeply transform. And last century's economic theories were not designed to solve this.

785
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:13,360
So we really shouldn't be expecting them to deliver on this. We need new theories, new textbooks,

786
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:19,360
new courses, new ideas, new policies to get us there. I just saw a graph this morning, which is

787
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:26,000
another sort of aha that Norway is probably the most successful nation in the world on scaling

788
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:34,560
electric vehicles. But their oil use is going up. So the addition of electric vehicles replacing

789
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:39,280
internal combustion vehicles has not reduced their their oil consumption.

790
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,200
Is it the domestic oil consumption? Because I know they're massive oil

791
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:46,720
producer and selling oil to others, but even domestic oil consumption?

792
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,920
The domestic consumption. Yeah, I'll send you the chart. So here's a question, Kate.

793
01:05:52,320 --> 01:06:03,440
Um, and this gets to the competition versus cooperation, uh, game theory dynamics of the

794
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:15,440
world. But if a country or a city or a region chose to let let's we're going to live in the

795
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:25,680
donut, we're going to follow this from an energy surplus, power, money, potential,

796
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:32,960
optionality on doing things in the world, they will be temporarily at least outcompeted

797
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:38,080
by those nations that continue to maximize profits because those profits can be spent

798
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:48,400
on things that either militarily or technologically will cause that that first few nations or

799
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:53,600
communities to be outcompeted, not in the long run, because in the long run, it's a tortoise and

800
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:58,160
hare sort of thing. And the tortoise we know ends up winning the race. But in the short run,

801
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:08,400
they'll be outcompeted. Isn't that an inherent like, uh, blockage to wide scale, um, adherence of

802
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,920
of these ideas? What do you think about that? Yeah, really important point. So let me start

803
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,560
at the level of the city. When cities actually start aiming to do this, I think they actually,

804
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,720
they might not have, you know, grow, grow, grow the city. And many city policymakers say,

805
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,200
that's not our goal. That's not what we judge a success for our city to get bigger,

806
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,720
to bring in more and more big companies to expand, have more and more housing.

807
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,360
People are creating cities that are great places to live where you can move quickly, where the

808
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,120
air is clean, where there are good schools for kids, where there's nature,

809
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:47,440
where you feel you won't be hit by a heat wave in the summer. These, these are all qualities of

810
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,560
living in the doughnut, where there's a strong community, there's public luxury. This brings

811
01:07:52,560 --> 01:07:57,520
people in. I mean, these city connoble is an example. People are moving to connoble. It's

812
01:07:57,520 --> 01:08:03,440
seen as a, actually that's a really desirable place to live. So the city scale, I think actually

813
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:09,600
it's a signal, especially for industries where people can work remotely and, and parents as

814
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,280
they can have their parental hat and their work hat. And I can actually be around for my kids and

815
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:19,120
I can reconnect and I want to raise kids here. It brings crowds of people in. Now when you go to

816
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:25,440
the national level. We need those bold, those bold civic leaders to go in this direction

817
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:32,240
to then act as pilots of success living this way. Yes. Yes. And I think that, and I'm not

818
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:39,040
surprised that it's cities starting. Cities are more sites of experiment and courage to, to start

819
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:44,080
moving. And I think nations are going, I'm hoping and I'm expecting nations are starting to look

820
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,960
at what's happening in cities and saying, actually, this is, this is the seeds of proof of concept and

821
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,840
can we start doing this national? But this point you just raised, I think is a really big one.

822
01:08:54,560 --> 01:09:00,080
And I, when we, when we say, okay, we need to move away from growth dependency, the question becomes

823
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:05,600
how our economy is currently structurally dependent upon endless growth. And there are

824
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:11,520
at least eight ways, right? There's four financial ways companies pursue maximum returns for their

825
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:16,080
shareholders, that drives growth, commercial banks create money as interest bearing debt,

826
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,200
that drives growth. When, if the economy is not growing, but companies are still chasing labor

827
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,800
productivity, that creates unemployment. So you need growth to absorb the unemployment.

828
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:31,360
On the other side, social lock ins, right, people still after 100 years of propaganda,

829
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:38,080
thank you very much, Edward Bernays for succeeding, right? Convincing us that the way we will improve

830
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:41,040
ourselves is to buy something more. So there's that kind of consumerism.

831
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:50,000
Having a growing economy helps avoid the ultimate redistribution question. And so it avoids actually

832
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,880
having to tackle redistribution. But one of them really important social lock into growth, and it's

833
01:09:54,880 --> 01:10:00,160
kind of geopolitical lock into growth, as you just mentioned, I look at the G20 photo that's

834
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:04,640
taken every year. And I think well, no leader wants their country to lose their place in that G20

835
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,520
family photo. But if one of those nations amongst them said, we're no longer going to pursue growth,

836
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:13,680
we're going to pursue a resilient national economy, well, there is, particularly in the

837
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,480
current atmosphere in the world, there is the geopolitical view, political military question

838
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:25,840
of geopolitical power and military power, and resilience against threats. And I think

839
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:33,040
Europe, I mean, the European countries coming together and creating a region is one very good

840
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,720
example of how countries, individual countries can overcome that by saying, well, we together,

841
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:42,720
we are stronger, we stand so that we don't individually all have to keep growing, we keep

842
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:49,600
no the size of us together. But I but to me, this is one of the very most challenging lock ins to

843
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,160
to structural dependency on growth. And I don't think the solution is an economic question. I

844
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:58,160
think it's a political international relations question. And just as much as I would love

845
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,400
these ideas to be taught in economics departments, I think every student studying macro economics

846
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,960
should absolutely be encountering a macro economics course in post growth thinking.

847
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,720
I think all schools of government should be introducing their students to questions of

848
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:20,960
how can we create, think about geopolitical power and power dynamics and relations and

849
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,520
international relations in a post growth context, because you've just pointed out one of the most

850
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:31,200
critical collective action problems we have. Why are schools of government not grappling

851
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,280
with this head on? I think they're too much influenced by schools of economics that again,

852
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,680
thanks to that one time power pulse from fossil fuels, assume that growth is the norm. And so we

853
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:44,320
do international relations in the context of assuming growth is the norm for all nations. I

854
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:51,040
think it's time to move on. I think I on one of our one on one calls, I think I told you this story,

855
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:57,360
but in the last 10 or 15 years when I'm talking to high level government people around the world,

856
01:11:59,120 --> 01:12:07,520
almost all of them were either themselves or directly flanked by a PhD in economics or finance,

857
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:15,200
like everyone. And it's like they're the gatekeeper to the politician. So it makes these things

858
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:21,600
hard. And there's like a glass ceiling of what can be discussed at those levels.

859
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:30,800
Except you were highlighted last month at a beyond growth conference, which the head of the EU

860
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:37,520
Commission president started out. That must have been a proud moment for you to highlight such an

861
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:44,960
amazing thing at the European Commission. Yes. Yes. So the group of MEPs in Europe organized

862
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:50,880
the beyond growth conference in the European Parliament. And it was opened by a Sivanda

863
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:56,960
Lyon and she it was it was impressive to see her there. I say it was really important to see her

864
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,400
there. And to see her saying, I think she said, you know, fossil fuel based growth is in the past.

865
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,640
And it's got yeah, she didn't say just growth. No, she said fossil fuel based growth. Yeah.

866
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:12,480
It's still a win. Yeah. But the fact that she came to a conference and stood on a platform where

867
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:18,000
it said very large letters behind a beyond growth, that's that's very different from 10 years ago.

868
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:22,800
And it was really important that that conference happened. And many excellent post growth thinkers

869
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:30,640
across Europe, D growth, post growth, donate economics, well being economies were there and

870
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:36,160
talking about what does it mean and indeed not just Europe from around the world, really starting

871
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,840
to dig into what does it mean in terms of the metrics in terms of the macroeconomic policies

872
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,640
in terms of the labor transition in terms of business design, showing that there is a whole

873
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:50,000
other form of economic thinking emerging and ready to be taken far more seriously. So I think

874
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,760
it was very, very important that that happened in the European Parliament. And again, I was delighted

875
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,400
to be presenting the ideas of donate economics there and talking about using these metrics because

876
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:07,360
I could point to so many pretty major cities in Europe, Brussels, the city capital region of

877
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:18,320
Brussels itself, Barcelona, where am I trying to say Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Tommelila in Sweden,

878
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:24,560
and more and more, Bad Nauheim in Germany, some pretty big European cities are saying, yeah,

879
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:31,760
this we are choosing this the donut framework as our own new metric. So again, it's from the city

880
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,120
and regional level that it I know it brings it currency and credibility and recognition

881
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,920
within European Commission. And actually, there's been within the European Commission,

882
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:45,280
there's a group of civil servants within there who for the last at least three years from just

883
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:52,800
before COVID, they created a group called Donut for EU. And they within different European Commission

884
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,440
and European Union institutions started saying we want to bring this language. And for me, it's a win.

885
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,960
I don't you know, you don't need to see the diagram of the donut, you don't need to hear the word

886
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:07,600
donut whenever I hear a policymaker saying, we are aiming for well being or living well within

887
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:12,320
planetary boundaries or limits or within the means of the planet. To me, the word within

888
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:17,440
is a radical word, because you again, you're hearing it the economy within

889
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:23,360
the biosphere. So every time I hear a policymaker speak to a vision of well being within

890
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:29,760
the planet, you think, hallelujah, we are into a new paradigm with that one little word,

891
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:37,680
we're in a new space. So one of my addictions is unfortunately buying URLs that I might someday

892
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:45,440
use. And one of them I bought 10 years ago was livewithin.org. I keep renewing it. I haven't had

893
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:50,640
time. Speaking of time, how the hell do you manage all this? You were like the degrowth

894
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:57,120
energizer bunny. I mean, do you have, do you come up with all these graphical tools yourself?

895
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:02,560
Or do you have like a professional PR toolmaker? Or are these your ideas?

896
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,440
Are you saying did I pay somebody to make these bits of cardboard for me?

897
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:11,120
Well, no, I meant the ideas. Like I want a graphical tool.

898
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:18,080
So, okay, so when donut economics came out, the thrilling thing for me was the number of people,

899
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:21,680
as I said, who came up and said, love the ideas, and I want to do this. I'm a town counselor,

900
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:28,080
I'm a teacher, I'm a startup founder, I'm a community organizer. So that's why I set up

901
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:34,640
together with a team, donut economics action lab. We are a remote team. There are 12 of us

902
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:40,800
working across different countries. And together we are creating these tools. So

903
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,400
we knew right from the beginning that cities would say, what would it mean to do the donut city?

904
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:50,400
So we created a tool, came up with a kind of conceptual framework that we make as a canvas,

905
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,560
meaning it's something you can put on the table. You can literally, you know, put things on it,

906
01:16:54,560 --> 01:17:03,360
make it very visual, very tactile, very unknown, no equations in sight. We don't need equations for

907
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:09,280
this. It's a worldview reframing activity. And we do it in person. And you can do it online. So

908
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:12,960
everything we do, because we're a remote organization, it really helps us think remotely. And we

909
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:16,960
make all of our tools available on Miro and online, so that we can run web, for example,

910
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,880
the government of Bhutan got in touch. And they said, you know what, the concept of gross

911
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:25,200
national happiness, which guides us, it's actually got a lot in common with the donut. We want to

912
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:30,160
see what happens when we work together with the two concepts. And we ran some webinars for 100

913
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,960
civil servants of Bhutan online to share these tools with them. So I'm working with a team of

914
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:41,760
12 people. And I have to say one of the best things for me going from working alone when my book came

915
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:45,760
out. And all, you know, the interest that was coming, it was almost bouncing off me because

916
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:50,400
there was nothing I personally could do with it. But now there's a team. I say, you're a mayor and

917
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,440
you don't want to talk about cities. Let me introduce you to my colleague, Leonora. She's

918
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,200
our city's lead. You want to talk about business? You want to talk to Eric Sahan. You want to talk

919
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:02,320
about communities? Meet Rob. Talk about education. Meet Carolina. We've got this wonderful team of

920
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:06,880
people who are running with each of these and bringing practitioners together in a community

921
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,720
and conversation of peer learning groups. So it's a thrill for me in setting up an organization and

922
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:18,960
a team with my co-founder Carlotta Sand setting up this team to say, how can we make this work

923
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,200
distributive? Just like this ball, right? At the beginning, it was all coming at me. And this is

924
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:28,080
just like, I can't cope with all this. But let's distribute it across our team, but also across

925
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:34,560
the community. Of course, I'm working too hard and running too much, like many, many people and

926
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:41,600
personally, you think this is at risk of running me down and the times are urgent and the crisis

927
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:47,520
is now. And because of the crises that are hitting in the world, more and more people are suddenly

928
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:51,920
waking up and looking around for those ideas that are lying around. So how do we make sure that

929
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:58,240
they're really visible, really accessible? And yes, these are very serious issues, but how can we

930
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:02,240
make them irresistible? Because the last thing you want is people to say, you know what, this is

931
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:07,120
too complex, too overwhelming. I find it depressing and overwhelming. I'm just going to switch off

932
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:13,120
from it. I want people to say, that looks energizing, inspiring. I want to be part of it.

933
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:17,680
And then to lean in. And that's why I aim to make it playful. Well, actually, I just also like having

934
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:21,840
fun. Hell, let's have fun while we're on this team, right? It's got to be the most fun place to work.

935
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:27,280
It's got to be the funnest project to do, rather than just extracting from the world. Let's repair

936
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:31,040
the world and have fun while we do it. So it's the team at Donut Economics Action App and the

937
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:36,800
community of over 10,000 people who've joined our website and our platform. And it's just, I get

938
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,360
energy from every time somebody comes and says, oh, yeah, I'm using this in my town. I'm teaching

939
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:46,400
this in my classroom. I've used this in my class. It's just amazingly energizing because we can see

940
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:51,360
all the challenges in the world. And yet time and time again, you see people, the opposite is

941
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:56,080
happening. And it's not publicly visible all the time, but it's rising, it's bubbling, it's rising.

942
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:59,920
And I'm just going to lean all my energy I have into helping keep that rising.

943
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:07,280
Well, congratulations. With just 12 people, you are punching way above your weight on the impact

944
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:16,960
of sharing these stories with other people. By the way, last week I was traveling and I saw signs

945
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:22,560
there is already a national doughnut day, which in the United States people actually just eat

946
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:27,680
doughnuts. So I'm very happy there will be an international doughnut day with our planetary

947
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:35,440
boundaries. One final question before I get to the closing questions. So you were at this

948
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,960
Beyond Growth Conference. You and I have talked about this before. I often state that degrowth

949
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:47,840
is what we should do because of global inequality and because of resource and climate limits.

950
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:55,200
But the metabolism of the system won't allow that. So we will hit a wall and then

951
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:01,360
bend, hopefully not break. So degrowth is what we should do, but post growth is what we're going

952
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:08,800
to have to do. So the way I see it is there's two tasks here. One is to describe and flesh out

953
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,880
and advocate for what a sustainable, desirable society might look like with the governance and

954
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,320
the commons and the care economy and everything you've stated. And then how do we get from here

955
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:26,560
to there, which is a related but distinctly separate question. Do you have any thoughts on

956
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:35,440
that dichotomy? So definitely spelling out the vision of where we want to get to. And I really

957
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,400
appreciated that you said that earlier on. I said, you know, it's easier said than done. You said,

958
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:44,320
yeah, but it's really important to say it so we have a vision of it. And that is where I've placed

959
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:50,160
my energy. And, you know, again, in this big teamwork, that's the role I focused on playing of

960
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:56,560
how can the donor acts as a vision of where we want to get to. And it's an aspirational positive

961
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,920
vision. And then setting out some of the fundamental diagrams and the principles that would be part of

962
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,960
an economy that's got there. And then there's a question of, okay, if we do keep going, if we fail

963
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:13,360
to turn and keep accelerating at the wall, will we bend or break? I would say that I think the

964
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:18,640
degrowth community, as I understand it, they would say, when you say, can we bend, not break?

965
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:23,920
I mean, they would say, degrowth is the aim to bend. That's what people in the degrowth community

966
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:30,000
mean by a just reduction of consumption and production of less necessary things to come back

967
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,560
within planetary boundaries in a democratic way. That that is a beautiful vision of a bend.

968
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:40,080
But I hear you're saying, well, if we don't bend in time, then we're going to hit

969
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:45,760
crises. And it's going to be through shocks and through subsystems collapsing, that we're going

970
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:52,400
to be forced into a post growth future. Just one reflection I'll have on that. And I'm not saying

971
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:58,640
having set out how to get there. I do think we need a positive vision of what we're still aiming

972
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:03,920
for. I think really key to that is looking at going back to one of the structural dependencies

973
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:09,760
on growth and how do we remove them? Doing that work now gives us the best chance

974
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:15,040
to survive an era in which growth doesn't come. And that's why I think it's really an ethical

975
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:20,240
obligation on economists to look at this, you know, the radical uncertainty of the future

976
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:27,360
and the existential challenges of what happens if the growth based thinking gets it wrong,

977
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,720
I think puts a huge ethical obligation on looking at alternative futures.

978
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:37,120
But if I come back and think, well, what if we find out that we're going to, you know, if we

979
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:43,680
break, we don't bend well, we will find we're actually spending much of the century continually

980
01:23:43,680 --> 01:23:48,800
outside of planetary boundaries and people falling short. And the more that we stay out here,

981
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,760
the more that these crises are going to hit, the more the shocks are going to hit us.

982
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,960
And the first time I asked myself, okay, what if it turns out that

983
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:01,440
much of the 21st century is going to be lived outside of these boundaries and continue to be so,

984
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:07,760
does that change the goal? I still, it didn't make me move away fundamentally from saying that the

985
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:14,560
goal is still to come back to the donor. The goal still to be as resilient as we can is to

986
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:20,320
create systems that provision essentially for people's needs and do everything we can to combat,

987
01:24:20,400 --> 01:24:26,400
you know, every inch here matters. Every inch matters the closer we come to coming back within

988
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:33,760
those boundaries. So it didn't dislodge for me the value of this way of thinking. And I would

989
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,320
love it to be dislodged. And I can I just add a comment here, which is the donut may have come

990
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:44,080
after, you know, kind of our common future, the Brentland Commission and that definition of

991
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:48,720
sustainability. And then we get footprints in the long comes the donut. And I'm very aware it

992
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:54,480
stands in a line of thinking. And, and whenever I teach it, I always say to students, and then what

993
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:59,680
next? This is a, it's not a fight. It's not an endpoint. It's a, it's a point a long away. Our

994
01:24:59,680 --> 01:25:03,760
thinking is evolving. More people are coming saying, I want to create something more biocentric,

995
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:09,440
more nature centered. What would that look like? So I look forward also to the day that the donut

996
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:13,840
framework has been superseded, because we've moved beyond it, because there's a generation

997
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,560
rising who instead of seeing the donut, wow, I've been waiting my whole life to see that,

998
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,880
like a 50 year old might say that, yes, I've always thought like this, 20 year old, you show them

999
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:28,240
the donut and they go, yeah, yeah, I get it. Come on. And go further. They're born into that

1000
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:32,640
expectation. It's quite thrilling to see that. What are they going to create? What's coming next?

1001
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:39,760
Well, you've, you've done such important work on the Overton window of just thinking about

1002
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:45,760
how a new economy might be. I almost think that, and we've talked about this before, that

1003
01:25:47,200 --> 01:25:52,000
I'm trying to work on something called advanced policy, which is those things we're going to

1004
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,720
need to do in the future that are politically and socially too strange and forward to be

1005
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:05,920
accepted today. But if there was like a donut break glass in case of emergency blueprint that

1006
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:14,560
all governments, you know, city, county, national had like a rule of principles and then what to do

1007
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:20,800
once we're in this situation, but based on some of the core seven things that you laid out,

1008
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:26,800
I think that might be kind of interesting. I like that. Yeah, yeah. Because I think at the,

1009
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:31,120
first rule is please break the glass now and use the donut now. Don't leave it.

1010
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,880
Don't leave it sitting in the cabinet until the crisis hits, right?

1011
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:40,720
Well, at its core, and you mentioned Eleanor Ostrom a couple times, at its core, I think we

1012
01:26:40,720 --> 01:26:49,040
face a crisis of governance because our governments were not created or the institutions for this

1013
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:55,440
sort of a world and we're just stuck in our ways looking at old forms of governance and

1014
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:04,000
institutional thinking. So I mean, I think education is the first central point and this is great.

1015
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:12,400
So I have some closing questions, Kate, that I ask all my guests if you have a few more minutes.

1016
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:20,000
So more broadly beyond your books, your teaching and the Donut Economics Action Lab,

1017
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:26,080
you've thought about since the 90s when you had your aha moment and you left the dark side as it

1018
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:32,800
were these issues as a career choice. Do you have any advice just to the listeners or watchers of

1019
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:45,920
this program at this time of global poly crisis? If you are embedded in a worldview that sees growth

1020
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:55,600
as the goal, really deeply ask yourself a question that and move to, okay, my biggest piece of advice

1021
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:02,880
is to tap into what we deeply know in our own bodies, right? In our own bodies, we know that health

1022
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:08,080
doesn't lie in growth. I mean, when kids are small, yeah, that's a great sign of health. And then

1023
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:13,840
there comes a point where you don't want them to grow anymore. It comes to thriving and health lies

1024
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:19,200
in balance in our bodies. We really get that I need enough food and not too much. I need enough

1025
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:26,400
temperature and warmth and not too much. I need enough water, oxygen, stress on my body, enough

1026
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:32,240
and not too much salt, whatever you want to add, that my bodily health lies in balance. And if

1027
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:38,160
something inside my body tries to grow unstoppably, we call that cancer and we move in and we stop it

1028
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,040
as soon as we can. We deeply understand that and each one of our own bodies is a complex adaptive

1029
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:52,480
system. So each one of us is a miniature living ecosystem planetary experiment. If we can take

1030
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:59,280
therefore what we deeply know, not just metaphorically, but really deeply from the human body to the

1031
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:04,320
planetary body and say what makes sense for human health, makes sense for planetary health,

1032
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:11,200
and how then do I live when I tap into that thinking? And how do I eat and travel and

1033
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:17,840
invest and divest and protest and volunteer? And how do I protect the health of my body

1034
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,000
as part of the health of the whole planet back to how does the parent look off their child

1035
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,400
by looking off the world? It's deeply interconnected. That I think when we tap into that we give

1036
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:30,960
ourselves the best metaphorical opportunity to understand the much greater living system of

1037
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:42,080
which we are part. Sobriety and lagom. Yes. So how would you change that advice to a young

1038
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:48,480
human 17, 18, 19 year olds who are sitting in your Oxford class? Do you change your recommendations

1039
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:53,920
for a young person? Well, so these these many of these young people, as I said, they grew up

1040
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,640
climate striking. Their teenage years were spent marching for a stable climate. They've come from

1041
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:08,160
a very different place. And I would say to them have the courage of your age. And I mean your youth.

1042
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,280
You know, I've been in places where a young person came up to me after a talk and she said,

1043
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:18,160
I really wanted to ask a question, but I'm only 17. And I said, wait, you should have put up your

1044
01:30:18,160 --> 01:30:24,800
hand and say, I am 17. And this is my question because actually your youth is part of your

1045
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:29,840
power and your saliency in this room and your presence and your long term view to which we all

1046
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:36,720
owe you a long term answer. So hold on to that clarity of the demands of youth and carry it

1047
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:42,640
through into the classroom and question why you're being taught models that smell deeply dated to you.

1048
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:47,840
Because the biggest change that I've seen coming through, like we're saying in academic economics,

1049
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:54,880
was when the students demanded it's coming from below, it's coming up and believe that systems

1050
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,800
get transformed, you know, find out about the history of the civil rights movement and

1051
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,440
Gandhi and the decolonization movement and the suffragettes and the women's rights movements

1052
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:08,160
and always remember that it's been the rebels and the disruptors who were so deeply inconvenient at

1053
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:14,480
the time and often maligned. They are now celebrated on the classroom walls as the heroes of the age.

1054
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:23,360
And so those who protest and disrupt and disturb the system, you are doing key work of transforming

1055
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:28,720
this. And I would say those young people get involved because we know, you know, psychologists

1056
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:34,320
tell us and people feel, if the people feel an anxiety or a stress of the context, it's when

1057
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:38,000
you get involved and you start actually channeling your energy into being part of it and working with

1058
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,960
others and collaborating with others who think like you, that you feel energized and empowered

1059
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:48,560
in this situation rather than depressed and overwhelmed in the same situation. The situation

1060
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:52,800
around us is the same. How do we change it by changing how we engage with it?

1061
01:31:54,160 --> 01:32:00,720
Well, I feel energized and inspired whenever you and I talk. So I agree with you that finding

1062
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:06,800
like-minded people that share your ideals and visions of the future is one of the biggest

1063
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,800
pieces of advice I give to young people. And there's a 17-year-old in all of us, isn't there?

1064
01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:21,920
For sure. But I can't imagine being 17 today. I was just a complete child when I was 17 relative

1065
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:28,720
to the 17-year-olds that were my students learning about ecology and complex adaptive systems.

1066
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:33,360
You know, the world is caught up to this story, Kate.

1067
01:32:34,080 --> 01:32:41,120
Can I just say then, when COVID lockdown happened, my kids were 11, my teenagers, and

1068
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:46,560
we had to homeschool them. So I was like, oh, homeschooling. I thought, well, I know what I'm

1069
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:50,080
going to homeschool them first. I'm going to teach them system thinking. Because I had once

1070
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,520
argued, I'd presented the seven ways to think like a 21st century economist with a very mainstream

1071
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:01,120
professor, economics professor in the Netherlands. And he said, system thinking is far too difficult

1072
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,840
for undergraduates to understand. So I thought, OK, let's take this on. So I taught it to my

1073
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:10,480
11-year-olds. We sat down with a big white board. I drew some, here's a reinforcing feedback. Here's

1074
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:15,120
a balancing feedback. And we drew some basic feedback loops about COVID. And then I just

1075
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:21,200
handed over the pens and they went wild with it. And they drew from people playing the guitar in

1076
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:25,200
the back garden to pressure on nurses, to pressure and accountability of the government.

1077
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:29,440
And they just brought everything in. But my daughter, she was jumping up and down with

1078
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:34,800
excitement. She's like, now I can express what I want to say. You know, born systems thinkers,

1079
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:40,080
now we've given you the tools and language. You can, because you could see these feedback loops

1080
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:48,800
in the world. So it's also an incredibly exciting time to be educated if you're equipped with some

1081
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:53,760
of the ideas that are going to actually help us go forward. That's why I just, I find it exciting.

1082
01:33:53,760 --> 01:33:57,440
Hand over these tools to young people. Now, what are they going to see? What are they going to do?

1083
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:04,720
What will they envision that we can't see? Because we're, you know, I'm 52. There are so

1084
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:09,040
many possibilities that I just can't see. So I love that feeling of the generational handover

1085
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:15,120
as well. Let's see what the next generation do with this. I think we, as a culture, massively

1086
01:34:15,120 --> 01:34:21,840
underestimate teenagers. And I really loved teaching 18 and 19 year olds, Reality 101.

1087
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:28,160
But I actually think it has to start earlier, 12, 13, 14, 15 on these things. Because this is a

1088
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:35,120
huge resource. That's just being taught outdated trivia relative to what the world's going to need.

1089
01:34:37,040 --> 01:34:42,000
So what do you care, a personal question, what do you care most about in the world, Kate?

1090
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:49,040
So I am deeply inspired by Janine Benius, the bio-memory thinker. She's one of my heroes. And

1091
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:58,160
it's, you hear Janine talk about life, life's capacity to create conditions conducive to life.

1092
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:06,400
That fills me with awe. I'm not a religious person, but if I'm filled with awe of a miracle,

1093
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:16,080
of a marvel, it is the regenerative capacities of life on this planet. And the systems that

1094
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:23,280
keep reproducing conditions conducive to life. That is what I care about most as a living being

1095
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:27,840
on this planet. And that's why I care about economics, the art of household management,

1096
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:35,200
being in service to planetary household and creating an economy that is in service to

1097
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,840
continuing to produce conditions conducive to life.

1098
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:43,840
Other than when we first said hello, the biggest moment of joy in the last three hours for me was

1099
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:50,320
I saw a red fox across the road from me on my bike ride this morning. And yeah, the planet is

1100
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:56,640
an amazing thing. Even in its depleted state on the biosphere relative to a century ago,

1101
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:03,040
it is still a wonderful, amazing place, the only place in the known universe to harbor life,

1102
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:11,840
let alone complex life. So last couple of questions, what specific issue are you most

1103
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:14,800
concerned about in the coming 10 years or so in the world?

1104
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:25,520
I'm going to say, well, two things. One, we know more crises are coming. We know more ecological

1105
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:31,840
impacts. We know more food price crisis will come when for harvests fail, when there are floods.

1106
01:36:32,640 --> 01:36:37,760
One of my big concerns is how, coming back to the point of governance, how will we govern

1107
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:43,440
ourselves in those moments? How will we respond? Will we revert to ration economic man and hoard,

1108
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:50,720
and will powers extract as much as they can? This is a great moment to make your 15% folks.

1109
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,640
Will we respond like that? Or will we move towards Eleanor Ostrom's description of the

1110
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,800
Commons where we actually recognize that if any of us are going to get through it, because we're

1111
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:05,120
all going to aim to get through it, and we're going to collaborate. So to me, it's that concern of

1112
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:11,520
what is the groundwork that we put in now so that as those crises hit nations, will they shut

1113
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,720
their borders or will they collaborate? What happens over COVID vaccine? What happens during

1114
01:37:14,720 --> 01:37:19,680
food price crisis? How do nations respond to one another? That's the concern. And then the really

1115
01:37:19,680 --> 01:37:26,320
bigger, longer-term question of a deeper understanding. Well, for me, it's finance. I

1116
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:31,520
really, I still haven't done it. So I want more conversations with you. How do we take finance

1117
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:38,080
that was designed to endlessly accumulate? That's what financial capital has got into its

1118
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:43,680
current DNA. How do you repurpose that utterly human-created design? It's a human construct.

1119
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:52,400
How do we redesign that? So it's compatible with life on a planet that aims to continually

1120
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:57,760
produce conditions conducive to life. That's my, so it's not my, that's not my worry. That's

1121
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,080
my big curiosity. That's the, that's the next step of this that I want to much more deeply

1122
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:07,600
understand. Because until we redesign finance, not just tweak it, not just tweak it, but really

1123
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:13,920
redesign finance, we are not going to be creating systems, economic systems that actually belong

1124
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:23,360
on this planet. I agree. And I have ideas to be continued on that. So if you could wave a magic

1125
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:28,400
wand and there was no personal recourse to your decision, what is one thing you would do to

1126
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:41,040
improve human and planetary futures? Magic wand. I would wave a wand that would help every person

1127
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:50,640
on the, I mean, every person on the planet would realize, feel, recognize that we human beings

1128
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:59,920
are an utterly interdependent and dependent part of the web of life. If we got that, if we really

1129
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:10,240
got that and understood our dependence upon the whole earth's living systems, that to me is the

1130
01:39:10,240 --> 01:39:14,560
deepest change that would then follow through. I mean, of course, you're going to run into the

1131
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:19,920
design or institutions and that, but if we all deeply got that, and the next generation rising

1132
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:28,000
has that, to me, that's the best, the best implant that we can put into our hearts and minds

1133
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:35,120
that would help us redesign systems so that we actually belong again on planet earth, that one.

1134
01:39:35,120 --> 01:39:40,480
You're not the first person to suggest that we need a change in consciousness with a large amount

1135
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:47,600
of people in order to get to these change in aspirations and, and the doughnut. And it is

1136
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:54,800
happening, I think. It's happening slowly. But I'm amazed versus two years ago how many people

1137
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:04,560
are expressing these ideas, perhaps in no small part to your work. Awesome. So this was our first

1138
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:11,120
public conversation. I know your work. If you were to come back in the future for round two,

1139
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:18,160
is there one particular topic that you are passionate about that's relevant to our futures

1140
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:24,560
that you would like to take a deep dive on? Any ideas? It's going to be finance. I'm going to

1141
01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:34,080
be asking questions. Deep dive into, okay, how does this even begin to look? What is the structural

1142
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:40,960
design of finance? I mean, I always ask, well, I often say, isn't it weird that a squirrel gathers

1143
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,720
nuts in the autumn and buries them? When the squirrel comes back in January, it doesn't expect to find

1144
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:50,960
15% more nuts, right? So why do we expect to put money into something and expect to come back and

1145
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:57,600
get you 15%? So how could we redesign finance? What are the lock-ins to the current financial

1146
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:02,160
system we have? Is it possible for a new financial system to emerge alongside the existing one?

1147
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:06,320
What would have to change in people's own aspirations and sobriety and largom

1148
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:11,920
to put their finance in something? What would be the offer? All of that.

1149
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,800
I have started a new thing you might not know of, but once a month we have a reality round table

1150
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:25,600
with three or four former guests on a topic. Maybe to have you and Steve Keane and Josh Farley

1151
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:31,680
or John Erickson to talk about this question would be really good. That'd be great. I'm in.

1152
01:41:32,640 --> 01:41:38,800
Thank you so much for your time and all your work and to be continued, my friend.

1153
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:42,960
And thank you, Nate, for this podcast because you're bringing so many voices together in

1154
01:41:42,960 --> 01:41:47,200
one place that I know it's a hugely valuable resource for many, many people. So thank you

1155
01:41:47,200 --> 01:41:52,240
for this hosting, very generously hosting other people's ideas. I really salute you for that.

1156
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:59,280
