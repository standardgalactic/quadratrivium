0	29000	Greetings. Welcome to episode 100. What? 100 episodes. This time flew by. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding thing I have ever done hosting this podcast, challenging because we're covering a lot of issues, not just one. And invariably these issues infringe on people's understanding or belief or ideology.
30000	46000	And it's difficult to host a multi-topic podcast. Rewarding because I feel less alone, I feel motivated by the hundreds of thousands of humans around the world that are wanting to learn more about this story.
46000	67000	And that ultimately is the work, is we're trying to help more people normalize conversations about how everything fits together in a system science sense. It is threatening, it is daunting, it is scary, some of the information that we're presenting.
67000	80000	But I'm not selling fear. I'm trying to sell understanding. Actually, I'm not trying to sell anything at all. All of our content is free. We've turned all monetization off on social media.
81000	96000	We, of course, would accept and do need donations, tax deductible to the Institute for the Study of Energy in our Future. But it is my belief that anyone in the world that has internet could access this for free.
97000	114000	There's a lot planned going forward. I do want to have more podcasts dealing with responses as opposed to just the problems. As things get more threatening, I'm hoping that I don't fly too close to the sun and get burned.
114000	132000	But I'm all in on passing the baton to more humans working on this. I have asked for Episode 100, a friend of mine who works in a related space, to interview me. Without further ado, here is Episode 100 of the Great Simplification.
133000	136000	Today's guest is Nate Hagins.
136000	150000	Nate is the director of the Institute for the Study of Energy in our Future, an organization that works with many others to assemble roadmaps and off-ramps for how human societies can adapt to lower throughput lifestyles.
150000	158000	Nate holds a master's degree in finance from the University of Chicago and a PhD in natural resources from the University of Vermont.
158000	172000	He also happens to be the host of this podcast, The Great Simplification, except not today, because we are turning the tables and I am interviewing him. So please welcome Nate Hagins.
183000	185000	Hi, Nate. Great to see you.
185000	188000	Hey, Kate. Thank you so much for being here.
188000	198000	Well, it's a big pleasure and this is the 100th episode of the podcast and I'm very honored that you asked me to turn the tables and interview you.
198000	211000	And I just want to say that I think you very generously create this space and interview many people and give them space to put out their view, their knowledge, their experience of the world. So it's my pleasure to do that in reverse for you.
212000	233000	Yeah, it's not anything I really ever planned on doing and fortunately I have a lot of friends like you that have a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share. So here we are 100 episodes in and thank you for being the hostess.
233000	237000	My pleasure. So how are we going to go? I'm going to kick off in a way that you often start.
237000	247000	I'm going to ask you to give me lots of one minute messages, just like the top line of the way you think. And then we can dive in deep to things, okay? You ready?
248000	249000	I want to share one thing.
249000	250000	Mm-hmm.
250000	254000	Yesterday, my girlfriend's daughter brought me this little screaming goat.
256000	264000	And I'm thinking if there's really difficult questions, because I'm kind of nervous right now on the tables being turned, I might just differ and do the screaming goat.
264000	283000	Because, you know, when I prepare for these podcasts, I've gotten used to it where I do, Lizzie, my curator prepares me for the scientist or whoever it is and gives me an arc of a conversation and I kind of prepare and then I just sit back and I ask you questions, right?
283000	286000	But now you're asking me questions, so I'm a little nervous.
286000	295000	Well, thank you for saying that and thank you for putting yourself in this situation and experiencing from what it's like from the other side. And I think it's going to go well.
296000	297000	So...
297000	298000	Let's do it.
298000	309000	Let's do it. So let's jump in. I'm going to ask you just some big concepts that you use regularly in your work. Just give us a one minute summary of that message, okay?
309000	312000	Tell me about energy blindness.
313000	325000	Energy blindness is the fact that our society misunderstands energy in its role in our current living and our expectations.
325000	334000	There are four aspects. One is that energy underpins everything in nature and everything in human systems. We need energy for everything.
334000	347000	Number two, that we don't realize the scale of how much energy we use effectively four to five hundred billion human workers equivalent of fossil energy.
347000	363000	The third is that this stuff is depleting very rapidly and culturally we're treating it as if it were interest, but it's actually a principal, a bank account that is being drawn down millions of times faster
363000	379000	than it was built up. And the fourth aspect of energy blindness is that when we burn all this energy to give us the modern conveniences and transport and consumption, there is a pollution and a waste that comes with that.
379000	394000	And I think our cultural stories don't include any of that. And yet so much of our future and our expectations and institutions and culture depend on energy. So we're energy blind.
394000	399000	And I've sometimes heard you say that energy is the currency of life, yes?
399000	414000	Yes, in nature, those organisms and ecosystems that have surplus energy have had advantages. So there's lots of things important in life, but if you don't have energy, you can't move or eat or do anything.
414000	418000	So energy is the currency of life and it always will be.
418000	425000	I fully agree on that. And so then if energy is the currency of life, tell us about the carbon pulse.
425000	441000	Well, the carbon pulse is began when humans started to discover first coal, then oil, then natural gas and farm under the earth instead of on top of the earth.
441000	465000	And if you look at a 300,000 year aerial view of our species, this little sliver of time where we're drawing down this ancient carbon and propelling our civilization using it can look like a pulse, like an EKG pulse that starts from nothing,
465000	481000	goes to a high amount and then goes back to nothing. And we're all living in the middle of that, probably near the peak of that. And that is another thing that's not included in our cultural conversations is, you know, on a 500 year time
481000	501000	scale, we're a couple hundred years into the carbon pulse and what will the downslope of the carbon pulse look like. So I think this is an ecological deep time framing of the human cultural situation that is so prevalent in our lives, but we
501000	502000	don't talk about it.
503000	515000	Okay. And that's exactly what we're going to talk about today. So if we are somewhere near the peak of this carbon pulse, what's the story with the economic super organism? What is that?
515000	535000	So there are super organisms in nature like termite mound or an ant colony where all of the individual organisms collaborate and towards a larger unspoken goal. So the human super organism is not an actual biological entity,
535000	555000	but what it ends up being de facto an economic super organism that humans in this culture self organize as families as small businesses as corporations all the way up to nation states and the whole world to maximize profits.
555000	573000	That is our marching orders by our culture. And those profits are tethered to energy. There's a 99% correlation between GDP, our economic output and energy consumption and 100% correlation to material consumption.
574000	594000	And that energy is over 80% still tethered to fossil carbon. So what we're doing is rushing forward trying to optimize profits and GDP. And we've built all of our institutions and expectations around that without any other plan.
594000	616000	And what's happened is the momentum of that system, the momentum of that way of doing things is stronger than the individual wisdom and restraint that people within it try to imbue on the organism itself.
616000	630000	In other words, we're in a runaway train shoveling more fuel into it and there is no conductor. There's not a politician or a billionaire that can say, wait a minute, this is the wrong objective. We need to change it.
630000	646000	So the super organism is this metabolic system that is out of control and all it wants is more the lowest cost energy and other material things to power growth.
647000	654000	Okay, we're going to come back to this runaway train with no conductor later. What do you mean when you talk about the Mordor economy?
655000	667000	You know, J.R. Tolkien was so prescient in so many things. There's so many one liners from the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit that are so apropos to our current civilization.
668000	685000	So our economy is based on energy, materials and productivity from technology and a lot of our productivity has come from just adding more fossil energy every single year because it's so potent.
685000	706000	So some of our productivity has come from just more energy. And so the Mordor economy is instead of tightening our belts, instead of having ecological civilization, the default is that we will continue to have rule changes
706000	717000	and go and borrow more money and invent technology that might give us some energy, but it takes a lot of energy and materials to create.
717000	735000	And so what will happen is we will grow our gross, our GDP, which is our gross energy, but the amount of energy and materials and environmental impact that that will have will take up an increasing amount of the whole.
735000	756000	So in 1999, we hit a seven century low of how much energy it took to generate GDP for the rest of society. It was around 5%. Now we're over 10%. We're using 10 or more percent of our energy just to get the energy and refine it and deliver it to the rest of society.
756000	785000	As we go higher to 15% or 20%, we gradually become more and more of a mining economy, aka Mordor economy. And as you're well aware, the pollution impacts not only climate but biodiversity and sperm count drop and insect loss and deforestation and all of that will increasingly take a toll on the human system.
785000	804000	And we're going to have to use more energy and materials to remediate what's happening there. So in short, a Mordor economy is currently the default path. And depending on your boundary of analysis, many people could rightly argue the Mordor economy is already here.
805000	818000	But what it basically means is that we optimize growth over ecology and our entire system becomes one of mining and consumption.
819000	836000	And just to go into the stats you just gave there. So you're saying some years ago it was at a low like in a positive way that we were using around 5% of the energy used was to get access to energy and now that's gone up to 10% and you spoke as if that's inevitably going to rise.
836000	851000	I'm sure some people are thinking, but isn't that possible to bring it back down again with new technologies with nuclear fusion or other kinds of breakthroughs in energy technologies that this we could bring it back down there and even lower? What's your view on that?
851000	869000	Yes, well that would be the argument that some are using on artificial intelligence that it will rapidly find new ways of using our resources more efficiently or develop new technologies like nuclear fusion.
869000	885000	And if those are done cheap enough, then you're right, maybe we do go back to a period where 7% of our GDP is energy creation and delivery and refining.
885000	905000	But first of all, that's on the come. That's not the direction we're heading. Second of all, if that were to happen, we would still probably have a growing economy and this gets into the issue of Jebens paradox.
905000	929000	As the economy is growing, more efficiency and better technology doesn't result in lower energy use. It results in higher energy use globally and so the ecology side of the Mordor economy equation would be even more dramatic if that were to happen.
929000	950000	But yeah, there are a lot of things out there that are being developed, but it's the net energy of them that I worry about. And this is one of the, what I've referred to in the past is the tragedy of the energy investing commons is suddenly, especially with Ukraine and Russia and now war in the Middle East.
950000	979000	People are recognizing, holy crap, energy is really important. Let's do this or that technology to get more energy. But the actual energy and materials spent to procure that energy for society ends up being a lot larger than what has been 50 years ago when this whole civilization was kind of built forward on really cheap oil, gas and coal.
979000	992000	Okay. And since you just started mentioning some geopolitics in the world, can you just briefly explain what's meant when you and others in conversation on this podcast have talked about the metacrisis?
992000	995000	I'm suppressing the impulse to ask you what you think.
995000	998000	No, no, no, no, Nate, we've turned the table.
998000	1001000	No, I know that. I'm just telling you, I'm suppressing the impulse.
1001000	1002000	Great. Thank you.
1002000	1003000	You keep going.
1003000	1026000	Yeah. Well, the metacrisis, I mean, there's a lot of terms out there, the polycrisis, the metacrisis, I used to say the human predicament. It's when all these things are intertwining and coalescing and in an interconnected way, creating a really large capital letter problem.
1027000	1050000	There's the environmental crisis, there's the poverty, inequality, global south issues, there's debt, there are biological existential risks from bio weapons and CRISPR and AI and things like that.
1051000	1058000	Just the ecological planetary boundaries issues alone is a metacrisis unto itself.
1058000	1072000	And I mean, I'm sure we may talk about this, but one of the things I've learned from doing this podcast is there's so many bright people working on a part of the metacrisis,
1073000	1080000	but they don't see the other parts because it's too big and they're like experts on their parts.
1080000	1087000	But any one of these seven crises is huge on its own.
1087000	1096000	And so that's kind of what I've tried to do is connect how they fit together, but it's a big challenge as you're well aware.
1096000	1101000	Okay, so I've got two more of these concepts that you often use.
1101000	1103000	Oh, okay, we're still on the speed round, okay.
1103000	1105000	Yeah, we're still on the speed round, mate.
1105000	1109000	Okay, four horsemen, who are these horsemen?
1109000	1114000	You sometimes talk about the four horsemen I think of the 2020s, so explain.
1114000	1125000	Yeah, I'm increasingly talking about that because it feels incredibly relevant, more relevant than other topics.
1125000	1137000	So the four horsemen are briefly financial overshoot, which is when we've had economic problems in the past.
1137000	1148000	Instead of tightening our belt, we actually do the opposite and we widen the spigot of credit creation and central bank guarantees and stimulus checks.
1148000	1156000	And so the whole world is between 350 and 400% debt to GDP.
1156000	1164000	And all of these financial claims on reality will require energy and materials to be manifested.
1164000	1177000	So we keep creating more and more monetary what people think they own claims on a ecological and energetic reality that is going to shrink in the future.
1177000	1185000	And so this disconnect I refer to as a bend or break moment is coming soon.
1185000	1190000	So that's the first horseman is the financial recalibration.
1190000	1206000	The second is the move from a unipolar, the United States effectively world to a multipolar world, China, Russia, Europe, the various BRICS plus nations.
1206000	1219000	How the resource pie, how the monetary representations of who has access to what and 13,000 plus nuclear warheads.
1219000	1234000	How we navigate that 21st century, early 21st century game of risk in a peaceful, cohesive, non disruptive way is one of the horsemen.
1234000	1253000	The third is the complexity of our six continent just in time supply chain of medical pharmaceutical inputs and spark plugs made in South Korea only that get delivered to the United States.
1253000	1261000	Food is delivered 1500 miles to the average dinner plate in the United States.
1261000	1278000	We have an incredibly efficient but non resilient system for delivering basic goods and services to people around the world that is predicated on cheap oil, global peace and credit.
1278000	1292000	And then the fourth is the fourth horseman is the social contract and the trust and collaboration and interaction with citizens where you live.
1292000	1307000	And I don't know enough about British politics, but in the United States next year we have an election and I think no matter who wins a third of the country is going to be ballistic and upset and distrusting.
1307000	1315000	And with AI and polarization and just the general stress of society, how do we keep the social contracts?
1315000	1329000	So I personally think that any, and this is why I think this is important Cape, any social change towards the better in the long run.
1329000	1346000	Like we need to put price on carbon because we're burning more than the biosphere can take and we're burning it millions of times faster than it was sequestered and we should save some for our grandchildren as one example.
1346000	1365000	Any major wealth distribution, any social programs that make the future better off any issue that people are concerned with that radically changes our economic system will then first have to navigate these four horsemen.
1365000	1373000	And that is kind of the focus of my work is no matter where we're going we have to navigate these four horsemen first.
1373000	1383000	And so that ultimately my work surrounds how do we prepare and respond for those sorts of economic social speed bumps.
1383000	1384000	Got it.
1384000	1385000	Right.
1385000	1386000	So we're going to come back to them.
1386000	1389000	I have one more thing for you on this speed round.
1389000	1390000	Okay.
1390000	1395000	And it is, of course, the mothership concept, the great simplification.
1395000	1397000	What is it, Nate?
1398000	1403000	You know, I struggled with thinking about the name of this podcast.
1403000	1406000	That one had a triple entendre.
1406000	1415000	One was that for many people listening to this show in the global north, a simplification of their lives could actually be great.
1415000	1421000	We don't need all this energy and pecuniary trappings to live a good meaningful life.
1421000	1424000	So simplifying is a good thing.
1424000	1433000	Another is I have so many complex topics in the news and I try to simplify them in a way that people can understand.
1433000	1451000	But the main choice of word is an academic interpolation of Joseph Tater's work that he wrote a book called The Collapse of Complex Civilization.
1451000	1455000	And what humans do is we solve problems.
1455000	1459000	And as the system gets bigger, we solve more problems.
1459000	1469000	When we solve problems, we need more energy to throw at the technology or the supply chains or whatever it is we're solving.
1469000	1477000	And so what we've done on the upslope is we have incredibly complexified our lives.
1477000	1491000	And all this has happened every single year other than 2020, 2009 financial crisis, a few years in the 1970s energy crisis, World War and a Great Depression.
1491000	1500000	Any of those, all the last 150 years we've had more energy added to the human system than the year before.
1500000	1503000	And we just naturally assume that this will continue.
1503000	1513000	So the great simplification is when we are unable to continue to add energy to solve our problems, the inverse will happen.
1513000	1528000	A simplification where we have to do more with less technology becomes really important, efficiency becomes important, and we're going to have to live more locally.
1528000	1537000	And the word great is because I think it will be one of the greatest events ever faced in modern history, this simplification.
1537000	1539000	What does it mean in the vernacular?
1539000	1545000	I think one of the next three recessions will be a depression economically.
1545000	1551000	And the reason for that is had we simplified 50 years ago, then it wouldn't have been so bad.
1551000	1556000	But now we've got all these financial claims that we've created.
1556000	1561000	So the first step off will be a doozy.
1561000	1563000	A what?
1563000	1564000	A doozy.
1564000	1566000	I don't know if that's a British term.
1566000	1567000	Really?
1567000	1568000	You don't know what that means?
1568000	1569000	Doozy.
1569000	1573000	D-O-O-Z-Y means a big one.
1573000	1574000	A big one.
1574000	1575000	A big one.
1575000	1576000	Okay, it'll be a big one.
1576000	1577000	Okay.
1577000	1578000	Okay.
1578000	1579000	Great.
1579000	1580000	Okay.
1580000	1581000	Well, that is a big one.
1581000	1583000	I mean, these concepts you...
1586000	1588000	We're probably going to have to edit that out.
1588000	1591000	These concepts are big.
1591000	1597000	So we're just going to take a break and I just want you to appreciate my studio here.
1597000	1599000	Have you seen what I've done here?
1599000	1600000	Yeah.
1600000	1601000	That is...
1601000	1602000	Do you like that?
1602000	1605000	I only see you usually from the narrow window.
1605000	1612000	And now I see that you've got a great simplification podcast studio, London Style.
1612000	1614000	Thank you so much.
1614000	1619000	I've always been impressed by your creation of visual aids.
1619000	1621000	Did you do that just for this show?
1621000	1623000	Of course I did that just for this show.
1623000	1624000	Oh, my gosh.
1624000	1627000	I borrowed it from my neighbors and some little paper lanterns from somebody else.
1627000	1633000	And yeah, just, you know, had to inhabit the studio.
1633000	1634000	So it's great.
1634000	1635000	I like it.
1635000	1640000	Well, for the record, you so could do this.
1640000	1646000	I know you're very, very busy with Donut and Deal and everything, but you would be excellent at this.
1646000	1647000	Well, you're very kind.
1647000	1650000	Actually, a podcast is high in my sights.
1650000	1662000	I really think this method of exploration of ideas, of conversation is where so many people learn
1662000	1666000	and have time, whether you're doing the washing up or the ironing or taking kids to school
1666000	1671000	or, right, certainly for many adults, I know this is the only place I get to listen
1671000	1674000	and get ideas rather than reading.
1674000	1682000	But I think conversation between people is a fantastic way of all of us opening our minds,
1682000	1686000	which is, I think, why this podcast has become so popular and the way you host it.
1686000	1690000	So, so you've given us the big concepts, right, of a great simplification.
1690000	1693000	Now, let's just step back.
1693000	1695000	How did you get into all this then?
1695000	1697000	You didn't start out doing this work.
1697000	1701000	Take us back to what you were doing before you were doing this.
1701000	1709000	I want to hear the start of that journey and what triggering events have led you to be sitting here.
1709000	1711000	How far back?
1711000	1713000	You're going to have to choose that.
1713000	1717000	Take us to the place where we'll be like, you were doing what?
1718000	1722000	When I was three years old, I was sitting on my mom's lap in the front seat of the car
1722000	1726000	scanning the horizon for animals, and I would always want to go for a ride in the car
1726000	1732000	because I wanted to see what animals we could see either on the road or on the horizon.
1732000	1737000	And my mom said that by the time I was six, she had taken me to more zoos
1737000	1741000	than probably any other six-year-old in the United States.
1742000	1749000	So that's the foundation of it, is I had a deep love for animals in the natural world when I was a child.
1749000	1755000	And can I just jump in and say that's just a beautiful connection between deep love for nature, dependence on energy, right?
1755000	1757000	Fossil energy to connect with zoos.
1757000	1763000	It's this wonderful, complex story that you've inhabited right from the beginning.
1763000	1767000	Yeah, I didn't think about the energy part.
1767000	1770000	You're absolutely right.
1770000	1774000	I lived in Southern Oregon when I was in grade school,
1774000	1778000	and every day after school, I would rush home and get my dog,
1778000	1784000	and we would just go for hours in the foothills and look for salamanders and climb trees.
1784000	1791000	Well, he wouldn't, but that was my formative thinking where you let your mind wander
1791000	1793000	and you're just in nature.
1794000	1802000	I mean, to have a childhood like that and the formative impression that that has on your mind and your soul
1802000	1810000	is really a privilege because I don't think that many people have that freedom and access today.
1810000	1816000	But I think that was my rosebud to use a citizen cane term,
1816000	1826000	which is those free hours every day in the foothills of the Siski Mountains in Southern Oregon.
1826000	1834000	Then I got hijacked by status-seeking and trying to make more money to get a better car
1834000	1841000	and a better apartment and the American cultural dream in the 80s.
1842000	1847000	I went and got my masters at the University of Chicago, and I went to work on Wall Street
1847000	1850000	and I managed money for billionaires effectively.
1850000	1858000	I had to cold call people, but I wasn't allowed to call anyone if they were worth less than $100 million.
1858000	1861000	I'm serious. This was 1993.
1862000	1870000	Those were my clients, and over time, I realized that these people were no happier
1870000	1875000	than the clerks processing their trades, making $25,000 a year.
1879000	1885000	One of them started to trade, invest, speculate in oil.
1885000	1894000	I started to learn a lot about oil, and I realized, oh my God, it's going to peak and decline in my lifetime.
1894000	1897000	Oh my God, it's incredibly powerful.
1897000	1902000	I never heard the word energy mention my entire master's program in finance.
1902000	1907000	What? We don't pay for any of the pollution and the externalities.
1907000	1910000	Those aren't included in the prices.
1910000	1920000	I became so obsessed with learning about ecology and energy that eventually I wasn't doing my job real well
1920000	1925000	because I was obsessed on learning all this other stuff that I quit.
1925000	1928000	I gave my clients their money back.
1928000	1933000	I had a backpack full of books and a golden retriever, and I went to British Columbia in Alaska
1933000	1936000	and hiked and thought and read for six months.
1936000	1942000	Then I came back and Herman Daly introduced me to Josh Farley, who you know.
1942000	1950000	Josh and John Erickson were my PhD advisors along with Robert Costanza at University of Vermont.
1950000	1953000	That broadened out my awareness.
1953000	1956000	It's not just energy. It's not just oil.
1956000	1958000	It's human behavior.
1958000	1965000	It's aggregate anthropological momentum of the human superorganism.
1965000	1972000	I became really intellectually curious about how all this stuff fit together.
1972000	1978000	I became a contributor on the oil drum and eventually co-ran the oil drum,
1978000	1982000	which was an interesting model because we had over 30 PhDs
1982000	1987000	that were volunteering their time for the greater social good to share information.
1987000	1993000	It was a neat little cafe sandbox of intellectual collaboration for a while.
1993000	2001000	Then I got really freaked out about the debt versus energy thing in like 10 years ago.
2001000	2009000	I approached Homeland Security looking at how we would buttress our supply chains
2009000	2016000	if there was a Minsky moment where we realized we weren't able to service our debt.
2016000	2019000	So more Minsky than the housing market?
2019000	2023000	Yeah. Minsky with a capital M.
2023000	2028000	Do you want to just explain because some people might not know what Minsky moment means?
2028000	2036000	A Minsky moment is where you can no longer solve a credit crisis by adding more credit.
2036000	2045000	It's the moment where everyone recognizes what's happening and there's an exodus
2045000	2051000	and you can't solve the thing by adding more credit because there's no trust there.
2051000	2058000	Right now, the markets are approaching new highs and people are still dancing
2058000	2065000	because the credit spigot is still on, but they're dancing closer to the doors in talking with them.
2065000	2071000	But anyways, getting back to your question, which I'm giving way too long winded of an answer,
2071000	2083000	I then started realizing that the people in middle age between 25 and 60 have no bandwidth
2083000	2088000	because their status and identity were attached to the jobs and the positions they were in.
2088000	2094000	In this story, the great simplification, which wasn't fully formed back then,
2094000	2099000	was too abstract and threatening to their current work.
2099000	2107000	And so I did a barbell approach where I started to teach reality 101 to young people
2107000	2114000	and I talked to retired politicians above 70 years old who had time to learn about these things.
2114000	2124000	And then two years ago, just about now, I started this podcast and I've learned a ton
2124000	2131000	and I'll echo what you just said a few minutes ago that I have a pretty strong opinion
2131000	2141000	about how the world works and where we're headed, but I also know that no one can know everything
2141000	2146000	and there's so many things that I learned from all of my conversations.
2146000	2152000	And so I'm just trying to connect this tapestry of how things fit together,
2152000	2162000	but not only facts, also the humanity of people and how everyone on this program that I've hosted
2162000	2168000	really cares about the future and not a lot of us have answers on what to do,
2168000	2175000	but I think there's this emergence of this intellectual, heart-led understanding
2175000	2182000	and hope for a better future that there's something building there that I think is potentially important.
2182000	2191000	Right. And then on that journey from, say, working with those multi-millionaires to now,
2191000	2195000	just to keep you could name one big cognitive shift that you've made,
2195000	2203000	one big emotional change that you've made in your life and practical changes about where and how you live.
2203000	2211000	A big cognitive change. The cognitive change is the superorganism is incredibly powerful
2211000	2218000	and 15 years ago, I wouldn't have imagined that on the dawn of 2024,
2218000	2223000	we would still have this amount of debt and this amount of energy.
2223000	2236000	The cognitive change is that this superorganism has got gold-plated scales and is very difficult to stop.
2236000	2243000	So I've cognitively come to respect that, though at the same time, the more it grows and expands,
2243000	2250000	the worse the biosphere and other species are generally.
2250000	2264000	Emotionally, well, I've grieved for the future that our society tells us is coming long ago.
2265000	2271000	So my expectations are lower than the average person.
2271000	2274000	So emotionally, I've come to terms with that.
2277000	2282000	But emotionally, there's a bifurcation, Kate.
2282000	2289000	On the one hand, the stuff that I carry is increasingly feels like a lodestone
2290000	2298000	because I'm trying to stay on top of neuroscience and oil depletion and debt and biodiversity loss
2298000	2304000	and endocrine disruptors and each one of those categories is kind of fricking depressing.
2304000	2315000	And when you aggregate them all, humans didn't evolve to carry that amount of stress about the future
2315000	2317000	with them every day.
2317000	2323000	And the antidote to that, as you might know, because we were just together last month, two months ago,
2323000	2330000	is being with people like you and other colleagues that are working on this is like a balm
2330000	2334000	because I don't feel so alone and I don't feel the burden as much
2334000	2337000	because other people are living through thinking the same things.
2337000	2343000	So emotionally, that's kind of the battle.
2343000	2347000	And before you go on for one, actually, I just want to jump in there and say I recognize that as well,
2347000	2353000	the value of connecting with others and just to recognize that through the work I do with Donut Economics Action Lab,
2353000	2361000	what I've discovered is there are just so many people who share this but will never be on a podcast
2361000	2365000	or their name will never be known or will never get publicly recognized,
2365000	2372000	but in their communities, in their classrooms, in their town halls, they are leading and doing this and holding this as well.
2372000	2379000	And I get huge energy and solidarity from that as well,
2379000	2387000	that there's so many people who actually in their own way are holding the recognition that the complexity
2387000	2390000	and what has to change in starting to try and make it happen.
2390000	2393000	The third one was how have you changed where you live and how you live?
2393000	2397000	I live on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin.
2397000	2404000	I think it's a reasonably good place for the future, low population density.
2404000	2407000	People are kind of generally Scandinavian socialists here.
2407000	2409000	They help their neighbors.
2409000	2413000	It's close to the Mississippi River.
2413000	2416000	All the people I know and love are in the United States.
2416000	2421000	I mean, my family are in the United States.
2421000	2428000	For the longest time, my girlfriend and I grew maybe 30 or 40% of our own food
2428000	2439000	and we have horses and hazelnuts and apple trees and we were selling garlic to the local farmers market
2439000	2443000	because we grew thousands of bulbs.
2443000	2450000	But when I started this work, like in earnest a couple years ago, all that kind of changed
2450000	2452000	because I was very fricking busy.
2452000	2459000	So I'm trying to advocate that people simplify and my own life is suddenly complexified
2459000	2467000	and I struggle with that because I don't have time to do the weeding and the wood chopping
2467000	2472000	and the planting and the things that I was doing myself four years ago.
2473000	2482000	The other thing is one of the things I really recognize as a roadblock to sustainability
2482000	2491000	and living differently is our connection to social media and computers and instant stimulation technology
2491000	2497000	and I rail against that, especially with my 19-year-old students.
2497000	2505000	And yet I'm being pulled right back into it myself kind of unavoidably as an externality of this work
2505000	2510000	and I joke that I'm using the devil's tools to do Gaia's work
2510000	2516000	and there has to be kind of a middle of the fairway response there
2516000	2521000	but that's something that I'm struggling with in what I'm doing.
2521000	2531000	I could live in a 10 by 10 shack on the property here and use very little resources and live on the land
2531000	2536000	but then I wouldn't be hosting a podcast and passing the baton to other humans
2536000	2539000	who are trying to make a difference on our collective issues.
2539000	2545000	So it will probably perpetually be a challenge that I'm sure you also deal with.
2545000	2547000	Yeah, so a couple of things.
2547000	2554000	So when you say I don't have the time and I always think time is the ultimate constraint of our energy budget
2554000	2561000	because in a way what you're saying is I don't have the time to use my own energy, my own bodily energy
2561000	2568000	to chop wood and to plant food and to do all the other things as well
2568000	2574000	because using my own energy, doing a great simplification requires more of my time budget.
2575000	2579000	So of course we're always talking about energy.
2579000	2583000	Everything is always about energy because it's the currency behind everything else we're doing
2583000	2588000	but I'm really struck with the way energy keeps coming up, of course, in the story that you're telling.
2588000	2591000	I want to ask you one thing that I find challenging.
2591000	2595000	You're one of many people I know in the UK as well.
2595000	2599000	I know quite a few people working in the climate movement or environmental movement
2599000	2604000	and I live in the city of Oxford or they might live in London
2604000	2611000	and then there comes a moment when they lead the city and they go rural and they buy land
2611000	2615000	and they buy high land and they start growing food
2615000	2621000	and as a city dweller I think like is this prepping
2621000	2627000	and what challenges me is that we can't all buy that land
2627000	2631000	and there's not right Mark Twain buy land, they don't make it any more well.
2631000	2636000	There isn't enough for everyone to take that route so I kind of stand firmly in the city
2636000	2640000	and think well we have to make it work here too because most of us are here
2640000	2643000	so I'd just love to hear your little bit of a challenge there
2643000	2645000	and we just want to hear your response to that.
2645000	2650000	We can't all go rural and buy land and grow our own food.
2650000	2655000	I don't own the land I'm on and I totally agree with you
2655000	2660000	and this gets to a larger issue of the messaging
2660000	2666000	and the help of this podcast to various people around the world.
2666000	2670000	Everyone is in a different situation, there's not one size fits all
2670000	2672000	and that is something I struggle with.
2672000	2677000	As far as land, I just love living really and I always have.
2677000	2683000	I just hated New York City, I had to get out of there, it was sucking my soul.
2683000	2689000	As far as prepping, this gets back to the economic concept of comparative advantage.
2689000	2695000	I've learned that like one unit, one family, they can't do everything
2695000	2703000	and so I like to think of pro-social prepping that the first and most important thing there isn't land,
2703000	2708000	it's community and getting to know others and sharing responsibility
2708000	2713000	and you grow this and I'll process this or whatever
2713000	2719000	because there isn't enough time for every family to do all the things.
2719000	2727000	But yeah, the rural versus urban, I don't know the answer to that.
2727000	2737000	I think cities have ecological footprints, orders of magnitude larger than their physical proximity
2737000	2742000	and I don't know how that's all going to work out but I hear your challenge there
2742000	2753000	and I feel so privileged and lucky to live on the land and have animals, horses, chickens, geese, no geese, ducks,
2753000	2756000	guinea fowl and dogs and cats.
2756000	2759000	I don't have children but I do have animals.
2760000	2766000	I like the concept of pro-social prepping because that's something we can all do everywhere
2766000	2771000	and David Sloan Wilson will be the first to say we should all be doing pro-social prepping all the time
2771000	2773000	because we're going to need it.
2773000	2777000	That is one technology, one connection that we are all going to need whatever.
2777000	2778000	Totally agree.
2778000	2785000	Yeah, so you've told us the story of how you got your journey to here.
2785000	2791000	So let's hear your view on humanity's journey from here.
2791000	2798000	Okay, so I want to come back to the super organism concept and I've heard you in some of your franklies
2798000	2801000	or in some conversations with people.
2801000	2806000	It sounds like the super organism and by the way, as you know, I asked on Twitter,
2806000	2809000	hey, I'm turning the table and it's anybody and I got Godney questions
2809000	2814000	and people brought so many questions and thank you to everybody who brought in questions.
2814000	2819000	I'm not going to bring in as many of them as I can, but quite a few questions were around this.
2819000	2825000	So do you think that the super organism is beyond control?
2825000	2828000	It's just going to roll.
2828000	2836000	You recently interviewed Robert Sapolsky who said, you know, we are hardwired to get it wrong.
2836000	2838000	Well, are we hardwired to get it wrong?
2838000	2840000	So are we hardwired to get it wrong?
2840000	2845000	So the super organism is a source of finance and the structures and the supply chains
2845000	2850000	that all that contribute to this super organism.
2850000	2857000	Do you believe it's just locked in, inevitable that this is beyond our control?
2857000	2863000	Because that's a pretty strong conclusion to come to.
2864000	2869000	Wiring from our successful ancestors.
2869000	2877000	That can be soft or hard, depending on culture and the circumstances.
2877000	2883000	I love my conversation with Robert until the free will part.
2883000	2886000	And granted, I'm not an expert on that.
2887000	2895000	But the way that I see it is there are ecological and biological laws that are unfolding.
2895000	2902000	One is the maximum power principle, which is organisms and ecosystems in nature self-organized
2902000	2908000	so as to degrade basically an energy gradient or an amount of energy surplus.
2908000	2912000	And we as a civilization have been doing that.
2912000	2921000	And sometimes I think that we had to come to this point of finding fossil carbon
2921000	2930000	and building this monstrosity of a Rube Goldberg machine nature-eating mousetrap
2930000	2935000	in order to really have this gut check as a culture, as a species,
2935000	2939000	on a deep time perspective of where we are, where we're headed,
2939000	2947000	what we know, how we can do it to actually change the default path that we've created.
2947000	2955000	And I'm uncertain about what's going to happen,
2955000	2958000	but there are certain things I'm quite confident in.
2958000	2960000	Growth will end.
2960000	2962000	That is a certainty.
2962000	2966000	What's uncertain is how long in the future that will be
2966000	2972000	and what sort of a drop that will be and what happens afterward.
2972000	2977000	So the super organism is in control.
2977000	2981000	Just look at the prime minister in your country.
2981000	2986000	And the president of my country are both ostensibly climate aware,
2986000	2993000	yet they're approving new leases in Alaska and in the North Sea
2993000	2998000	because of the momentum of the system demands that we have that energy.
2998000	3006000	So I just don't know that any group of humans, as powerful even as they might be,
3006000	3012000	could stop this system until it stops of its own momentum,
3012000	3019000	which is that debt gets too big or there's a war that cascades everything down
3019000	3023000	or any number of things that would actually stop it of its own accord.
3023000	3026000	Other than that, I think we will...
3026000	3031000	Well, since 2015, the Paris Accord,
3031000	3037000	all the industrialized nations, perhaps with the exception of the US,
3037000	3041000	accept that climate is happening and it's because of emissions.
3041000	3048000	Yet since that time, we've grown our coal capacity by over 200 gigawatts globally.
3048000	3054000	So all the scaling of renewable energy and everything that's happening
3054000	3059000	that is ostensibly good for climate in the local region where it is,
3059000	3064000	hasn't done a thing to slow emissions globally.
3064000	3072000	So from an ecological climate CO2 biosphere perspective,
3072000	3077000	the superorganism is still completely in control.
3077000	3082000	And so what I'm trying to think about is what are the things we can do now
3082000	3087000	to anticipate and change the initial conditions of the moment
3087000	3096000	when the superorganism of its own weight and momentum and metabolism starts to splinter.
3096000	3099000	And I think that's coming in the not too distant future.
3099000	3101000	I don't know that I answered your question.
3101000	3107000	This is... I mean, I do interviews all the time, like I'm on someone else's podcast,
3107000	3113000	but to have you interview me on my podcast, it's a little strange, but...
3113000	3115000	Did that make sense to you, Kate?
3115000	3117000	Yeah, it did. And so I want to ask...
3117000	3119000	I mean, there's so many things coming up for me.
3119000	3123000	So you said, you know, we've done nothing at all to slow the growth of global emissions.
3123000	3126000	And I want to say, wait, well, we don't know the counterfactual.
3126000	3128000	What we know, we haven't stopped them from growing.
3128000	3132000	But perhaps, I mean, for all the civic...
3132000	3136000	If we hadn't done these things, then emissions would have been 10% higher than they are now.
3136000	3137000	OK, right.
3137000	3141000	So that means that there is resistance, there is intention to transform,
3141000	3147000	and it's having some impact, which, of course, for people who are dedicating their lives
3147000	3151000	or their weekends to resistance to transformation,
3151000	3156000	that's really important to know that we can actually make a dent on this thing.
3156000	3160000	We can start to shift it and we can believe that we can...
3160000	3165000	If we mobilize the right way and a lot of things come into line, we can move this.
3165000	3167000	I mean, I just want to offer some counters.
3168000	3176000	Yes, OK, the US and the UK still opening up licenses for new oil.
3176000	3181000	And yet other countries, Colombia, signing up to the fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty.
3181000	3185000	Other countries committing to move away from it massively investing in renewables.
3185000	3188000	So there are other countries that are doing differently.
3188000	3194000	So there's evidence that is not every political leader is locked into only going this direction.
3194000	3200000	And of course, we need that evidence and the hope of possibility that change can be made.
3200000	3204000	Boy, so lots of things to say here.
3204000	3209000	First of all, our entire civilization is based on carbon.
3209000	3214000	And so if we stop burning coal and natural gas and oil,
3214000	3220000	indirectly all the things in Walmart and Home Depot and whatever the shops are in London,
3220000	3223000	all of those have indirect carbon in there.
3223000	3226000	And I am a proponent that...
3226000	3230000	I'm not a degrowth proponent.
3230000	3233000	I think degrowth is what we should do,
3233000	3240000	but it's not going to happen because of the super organism dynamic.
3240000	3244000	Post growth is what we're going to have to prepare for.
3244000	3252000	And so I just think that every scrap of cheap fossil energy
3252000	3257000	when economic times get tough will probably be sought after.
3257000	3260000	I mean, India right now is...
3260000	3263000	And China, China has the most renewable energy,
3263000	3267000	but they also have the most coal and they're scaling coal dramatically.
3267000	3274000	But my larger point is this and something I really struggle with, Kate,
3274000	3280000	is I'm trying to act as a witness and a translator of what's going on,
3280000	3284000	both in my own analysis and in the people that I interview.
3284000	3294000	That is different than being a cheerleader and a spokesperson and an activist.
3294000	3304000	So I really struggle with this podcast at times on being accurate or being helpful.
3305000	3312000	And I really do think that a lot of the discussions in the climate and degrowth space
3312000	3317000	are energy blind and they don't realize the critical importance
3317000	3322000	that oil and other energy has to every aspect of our society
3322000	3326000	and that if we were to do the right thing ecologically
3326000	3331000	and really crimp our use of hydrocarbons,
3331000	3337000	that would entail a massive collapse in the state of our world
3337000	3342000	unless it happened gradually and it was planned for.
3342000	3348000	And I'm trying to tell the truth but also be inspiring and helpful to people
3348000	3351000	and sometimes that's hard.
3351000	3353000	So much to say in response.
3353000	3358000	I recognize that you may struggle with am I being a witness
3358000	3361000	and am I being helpful because of course I'm sure you're very aware
3361000	3366000	that your voice and your opinion also has influence.
3366000	3368000	It's not just from the outside.
3368000	3373000	So you might say I'm not an activist but the position you hold
3373000	3380000	and the forecast that you see has influence upon the world
3380000	3384000	and so in a way it's an action, it's playing into it.
3385000	3386000	But I want to pick up on...
3386000	3389000	I mean you're the person from whom I know the phrase
3389000	3391000	will we bend or break?
3391000	3394000	Now that tells me that there's an option there
3394000	3399000	that this isn't just we're going to roll it out, we're just going to use it all.
3399000	3406000	There is a choice and there's a possibility that we could bend
3406000	3410000	and we have left it late as you've said but that we can bend
3410000	3416000	and I see your podcast as informing us so that we can be as informed as we can.
3416000	3422000	How do we now bend rather than we're just watching this thing slide towards break?
3422000	3428000	Yeah, so the bend versus break initiated with my work with Homeland Security
3428000	3434000	on the financial recalibration because when that happens
3434000	3439000	and things cascade, it could be really bad
3439000	3446000	and of course nuclear war or all kinds of other things could precipitate that.
3446000	3451000	I actually am hopeful that humans will navigate what's coming
3451000	3454000	and that we will bend as opposed to break
3454000	3460000	but bending isn't just turning off coal and natural gas and installing solar panels
3460000	3464000	the ask is much, much deeper than that.
3464000	3469000	I'm agnostic on whether renewables globally
3469000	3472000	and as you know you've watched my stuff.
3472000	3475000	There's no such thing as renewable energy.
3475000	3479000	The ball of gas in the sky is renewable and the wind is renewable
3479000	3483000	but these components that we build to harvest the sun and the wind
3483000	3486000	will have to be rebuilt every 20 or 30 years.
3486000	3490000	Very little of the components that go into them are being recycled
3490000	3495000	so without this giant amount of energy surplus that we take for granted
3495000	3500000	how will we build those things 20 years from now, 40 years from now, 60 years from now?
3500000	3504000	So the answers are we're going to have to use less
3504000	3509000	but we're not going to choose to use less as a society.
3509000	3514000	As individuals and communities maybe we can choose to use less ahead of time
3514000	3519000	psychologically becoming more resilient by consuming less
3519000	3524000	prepares an individual for a simplified future.
3524000	3529000	And then I think the social capital of having conversations about this
3529000	3534000	in communities wherever you live in the world
3534000	3539000	looking two or three steps ahead and trying to ignore the siren song of
3539000	3544000	AI and cooler gadgets and markets are near all-time highs
3544000	3548000	and we've always had problems before and technology solved it
3548000	3552000	and look at what's really happening at the ground level.
3552000	3557000	I do think humans will have some emergent practices
3557000	3563000	and new things that I can't even offer to you right now.
3563000	3569000	I just see it in a lot of places that these conversations are happening.
3569000	3573000	I lost the core of your question there.
3573000	3577000	So we're on bend or break I was really struck and I was glad to hear you say
3577000	3582000	I'm hopeful that we can bend and it's going to take a lot more.
3582000	3590000	Let me make a clarification on something earlier.
3590000	3595000	I chose the word simplification because I think we're headed for a smaller
3595000	3598000	less global less material society.
3598000	3601000	I did not use the word collapse.
3601000	3604000	First of all collapse is binary.
3604000	3607000	It's yes collapse or no collapse.
3607000	3610000	Simplification is more of a spectrum.
3610000	3614000	Second of all the great simplification is already here.
3614000	3616000	It's just not evenly distributed.
3616000	3621000	I mean there are many places in the world that are already suffering
3621000	3624000	a post-economic peak.
3624000	3629000	For instance I had a young woman from Lebanon on the podcast.
3629000	3633000	Lebanon's economy is down 50% from three years ago.
3633000	3637000	That is a simplification and I'm sure people following the news
3637000	3642000	all different places in the world are experiencing natural resource problems
3642000	3646000	and economic problems and currency problems.
3646000	3650000	So I don't think collapse is inevitable.
3650000	3653000	I think a simplification is inevitable.
3653000	3656000	But I guess it depends on how you define the terms.
3656000	3660000	Right and just to come back I heard you say several times over many episodes
3660000	3663000	degrowth is what we should do.
3663000	3666000	Post-growth is what we probably will do.
3666000	3669000	Can I just clarify because people mean very different things when they use this language.
3669000	3672000	Do you mean by degrowth do you mean a planned...
3672000	3675000	I mean this is what when I listen to leading thinkers in the degrowth movement
3675000	3678000	like Jason Hickel and Yorgos Callis they would say
3678000	3683000	degrowth means a planned reduction in material and energy use
3683000	3686000	of the less necessary consumption and production.
3686000	3691000	So do you mean we should plan to reduce
3691000	3694000	but you don't think that we will do it
3694000	3698000	and therefore we'll get post-growth which would be a forced reduction.
3698000	3701000	Would that be a way of putting it?
3701000	3703000	Yes.
3703000	3707000	A little more I'll add to that.
3707000	3713000	From an ecological deep time ethical perspective
3713000	3715000	degrowth is what we should do.
3715000	3720000	If you had a benevolent pro-social alien philosopher looking at Earth
3720000	3724000	our consumption is massively unsustainable
3724000	3728000	so to protect the biosphere for future generations of ours and other species
3728000	3732000	we should use a lot less
3732000	3735000	and we should be living within our means.
3735000	3737000	I don't think that will happen.
3737000	3740000	Can I just interrupt you that moment and say like
3740000	3742000	here's a doughnut they made earlier it's the same thing right?
3742000	3744000	An alien looking at this would say
3744000	3746000	humans sort yourselves out
3746000	3748000	come back within planetary boundaries
3748000	3750000	by reducing your energy and material through flow
3750000	3753000	meet the needs of the poorest people in the world
3753000	3757000	and to me this is a visual of very similar to that same message
3757000	3761000	of planned reduction that meets the needs of all.
3761000	3764000	So we're agreeing so degrowth and doughnut
3764000	3768000	and yourself on that would say yes this is what we should do.
3768000	3769000	That's the should.
3769000	3771000	Okay, continue.
3771000	3774000	Well on the doughnut
3774000	3777000	what I would say is that
3777000	3779000	human behavior, individual and aggregate
3779000	3782000	that the inner part of the doughnut
3782000	3785000	will not want to stay within boundaries
3785000	3788000	it will want to expand
3788000	3791000	and so the inner part of the doughnut
3791000	3795000	will want to be greater than its planetary boundaries
3795000	3798000	and that's what we face of sorts.
3798000	3801000	So I think the doughnut to use your work and your example
3801000	3805000	is a great carrot for an Overton window
3805000	3807000	of where we need to go
3807000	3810000	but what I mean about degrowth not happening
3810000	3813000	is I don't think there is a way politically
3813000	3816000	for a country or a world
3816000	3821000	to consciously with a plan degrow
3821000	3824000	because there would be riots
3824000	3827000	and craziness and financial market collapses
3827000	3831000	and nuclear war and actually if it were
3831000	3834000	if we did have the authoritarian means
3834000	3836000	to degrow voluntarily
3836000	3839000	I think it would trigger the four horsemen
3839000	3841000	in quite bad ways.
3841000	3842000	What we can do.
3842000	3844000	Wouldn't the continued pursuit of growth
3844000	3848000	I've also heard you say like the continued pursuit of growth
3848000	3852000	is likely to trigger those very same things.
3852000	3855000	Yes and here we are Kate, that's correct
3855000	3857000	but that's not immediate
3857000	3862000	and there are chances that we might design some new technology
3862000	3866000	if AI were suddenly to imbue wisdom
3866000	3869000	into its algorithms as well as intelligence
3869000	3871000	I'm not holding my breath
3871000	3874000	but there are possible ways that we could
3874000	3879000	invent mushrooms that sequester carbon
3879000	3883000	and that we change our GDP
3883000	3888000	to include things that are of ecosystem service benefits
3888000	3890000	or things that I can't imagine
3890000	3894000	but my larger point is that degrowth
3894000	3897000	we can change the initial conditions
3897000	3900000	which is why a lot of my friends are in the degrowth movement
3900000	3904000	because we ultimately have to start thinking about
3904000	3908000	how to organize our own lives and that's of society
3908000	3911000	by using less material and resources.
3911000	3915000	I just think it not only won't happen voluntarily
3915000	3918000	but it is incredibly dangerous where it to happen
3918000	3920000	suddenly and voluntarily.
3920000	3925000	But to me this is the home turf towards bend
3925000	3928000	like if we're going to bend, not break
3928000	3931000	we have to, whether it's in the name of degrowth
3931000	3936000	or other movements that we need to move in this direction
3936000	3939000	you said you're hopeful that we can bend
3939000	3942000	so I want to take our conversation in that direction
3942000	3944000	can we go there?
3944000	3947000	What would it take in different areas
3947000	3949000	if I can bring some different areas
3949000	3951000	so first of all I want to ask you
3951000	3953000	do you think that civil disobedience
3953000	3956000	and nonviolent direct action that we've seen
3956000	3959000	rising up around the world in different movements
3959000	3962000	do you think that is a way that people can play a role
3962000	3965000	in helping to make something happen
3965000	3967000	that the system will start to bend?
3967000	3970000	So let me clarify something
3970000	3974000	bend versus break could be society as a whole
3974000	3977000	in the past I've largely used it
3977000	3981000	to refer to the financial overshoot that we have
3981000	3984000	that when we issue new money
3984000	3988000	that money is just digital or electronic
3988000	3991000	or paper claims on a physical reality
3991000	3994000	we spend it on building out our physical reality
3994000	3996000	at the same time there's a liability
3996000	3998000	if we owe this money in the future
3998000	4001000	so we're building our physical structure higher
4001000	4004000	and eventually there's going to be this
4004000	4007000	wily coyote moment where those claims
4007000	4011000	can't be fulfilled by our underlying reality
4011000	4014000	and so when I refer to bend versus break
4014000	4015000	it's that moment
4015000	4020000	but you also could say we're at a social contract
4020000	4022000	bend or break moment
4022000	4025000	and you also very correctly could say
4025000	4029000	we're at a planetary boundaries bend or break moment
4029000	4032000	so there's lots of different bend versus breaks
4032000	4036000	so as far as civil disobedience
4036000	4040000	I'm of two minds with that
4040000	4043000	a lot of the people that are out there
4043000	4046000	with just stop oil and other civil disobedience
4046000	4049000	have the same value systems that I do
4049000	4052000	so in that sense I fully support
4052000	4055000	what they're doing and their intent
4055000	4058000	but from the perspective of the four horsemen
4058000	4061000	which is my systems ecology vantage point
4061000	4064000	I have two problems with that
4064000	4068000	one is there could be a triggering of
4068000	4073000	a disruption that could be the cure is worse than the disease
4073000	4077000	and the second is that for all of these things
4077000	4079000	that we care about
4079000	4083000	we're looking at a non-systemic solution
4083000	4088000	like let's make natural gas and propane stoves
4088000	4091000	in the northeast make those illegal
4091000	4096000	or let's shut down all the coal plants
4096000	4100000	so those two things would be good for climate change
4100000	4102000	for the people that care about climate change
4102000	4104000	but everyone else is looking at that
4104000	4106000	and saying why are we doing that
4106000	4109000	that doesn't make sense from our economic
4109000	4111000	our current cultural values standpoint
4111000	4116000	so we're solving things by using our lens
4116000	4120000	of the problem without looking at the whole system
4120000	4123000	and so I think we need to have an extension
4123000	4126000	of the degrowth conversation is
4126000	4134000	how do we live and plan for a less connected
4134000	4138000	global society where our aspirations
4138000	4140000	are something more than consumption
4140000	4142000	and dopamine etc
4142000	4144000	and I know that's embedded in the degrowth
4144000	4148000	of scholarship in places
4148000	4152000	and it's embedded in your work on the donut
4152000	4157000	so I'm I just I guess I'm too focused on
4157000	4161000	the systemic risk aspect to be a big fan
4161000	4163000	of civil disobedience
4163000	4165000	but we can't go on a march saying
4165000	4171000	make everything right again
4171000	4175000	right and that's why I'm at a crossroads
4175000	4179000	in this work Kate because other than
4179000	4182000	individual preparation and designing
4182000	4187000	ben not break policies for governments
4187000	4191000	I don't know what the the movement is
4191000	4194000	that would be popular and this is a big
4194000	4197000	challenge with this podcast is there are
4197000	4200000	so many different demographics that follow
4200000	4203000	this show there are energy experts and
4203000	4206000	there are psychologists and there's
4206000	4208000	degrowthers and there's a lot of climate
4208000	4212000	people that follow this and it's hard to
4212000	4217000	look at everything beyond the one thing
4217000	4219000	that you care about and so what ends up
4219000	4222000	happening is events in the world are
4222000	4226000	getting dicier and worse and so I'm
4226000	4229000	expanding this conversation but it ends
4229000	4234000	up offending people that are in one area
4234000	4237000	of their focus and it's really hard
4237000	4240000	this could be a much more popular and
4240000	4242000	maybe helpful podcast if I just focused
4242000	4247000	on one thing and you know bellowed my
4247000	4250000	heart and soul out on that one thing
4250000	4253000	and attracted those viewers in the world
4253000	4255000	that were knowledgeable and cared about
4255000	4259000	that one thing but the one thing is the
4259000	4261000	system it's how all this stuff fits
4261000	4265000	together and I do not know what the
4265000	4267000	answers are in fact I don't even use the
4267000	4270000	word answers or solutions I use responses
4270000	4274000	and in coming months I'm going to have
4274000	4279000	franklies on responses to government
4279000	4281000	for philanthropy for communities and
4281000	4283000	for individuals and these are just
4283000	4287000	guesses because I've spent 20 years
4287000	4289000	trying to understand the problem and
4289000	4291000	that qualifies me to say well no I
4291000	4293000	don't think that'll work because of X
4293000	4296000	but I don't know what to do Kate.
4296000	4298000	Yeah have you ever had anyone on the
4298000	4300000	podcast who speaks from experience of
4300000	4303000	leading and immersed in civil disobedience?
4303000	4305000	Well yesterday I interviewed Bill
4305000	4309000	McKibbin who has a very long success
4309000	4313000	track record of building movements as
4313000	4317000	far as civil disobedience no I have not.
4317000	4319000	Maybe that could be a cool one for the
4319000	4322000	future because I personally you know I
4322000	4324000	take my kids to their school right when
4324000	4326000	they were changing going to secondary
4326000	4328000	school and you go in the classroom see
4328000	4330000	these schools and like who's on the wall
4330000	4333000	Emily and Pankhurst, Suffragette, Scandi,
4333000	4335000	Martin Luther King it's like all these
4335000	4338000	heroes are on the wall and we know that
4338000	4340000	every one of them in their day were so
4340000	4344000	troublesome so annoying so disruptive
4344000	4347000	and yet we celebrate them now for what
4347000	4349000	they did to change this big system so I
4349000	4352000	deeply believe in the power of civil
4352000	4355000	disobedience and nonviolent direct action
4355000	4357000	to at least try at least to seek to
4357000	4360000	persuade presidents and prime ministers
4360000	4363000	not to open up that oil field and to
4363000	4366000	and to transform so all these different
4366000	4368000	pieces of pressure but anyway I would
4368000	4370000	love to hear you interviewed.
4370000	4373000	At a deep level this podcast and if I
4373000	4375000	keep it going in the future is a form
4375000	4377000	of civil disobedience because the
4377000	4379000	things that I will be saying are going
4379000	4382000	to be threatening to the status quo.
4382000	4384000	Okay okay keep listening.
4384000	4386000	But I will take your advice and if you
4386000	4387000	could recommend someone for me to
4387000	4389000	interview I will do that.
4389000	4390000	Oh sure I can.
4390000	4392000	So I'm going to lean us into okay what
4392000	4396000	if we we could bend right I'm talking
4396000	4397000	about a system as a whole now it could
4397000	4400000	it could it could bend if we align
4400000	4403000	enough things or it will break so I
4403000	4405000	want us to lean into the possibility
4405000	4407000	of bend now and I'm just going to ask
4407000	4409000	you from different sectoral points of
4409000	4412000	view just kind of going back to short
4412000	4416000	first take answers okay so the finance
4416000	4419000	system okay from here what would we
4419000	4423000	need to do if we were to bend finance
4423000	4425000	as it has been created and I'm just
4425000	4426000	going to recognize that it's entirely
4426000	4428000	human construct it's entirely invented
4428000	4431000	so we can reconstruct it but we are
4431000	4433000	where we are right now what do you think
4433000	4436000	could be done to make it start to move
4436000	4438000	towards bend other than what what I see
4438000	4440000	seeing coming is is a great big snapping
4440000	4443000	sound and that's the simplification.
4443000	4447000	So on on each of these topics there is
4447000	4450000	a what to do now what to do at the
4450000	4454000	moment of a crisis and what to do like
4454000	4457000	that's more sustainable in 30 or 40 years
4457000	4459000	30 or 40 years from now the financial
4459000	4462000	system should be smaller leverage that
4462000	4465000	got us into this weapons of financial
4465000	4468000	mass destruction should not be allowed
4468000	4471000	the currency should be tethered to
4471000	4474000	something real like land or energy
4474000	4479000	production but for us to do that now
4479000	4483000	given the gargantuan you know 100
4483000	4486000	trillion a day and currency swaps and
4486000	4489000	things like that you can't get there
4489000	4495000	what needs to be done to avoid break is
4495000	4500000	if we go back to a 2009 moment when we
4500000	4502000	were on the cusp of all the banks in the
4502000	4505000	world failing and they came through
4505000	4510000	with tarp and the bazookas of central
4510000	4512000	banks and government guarantees which
4512000	4514000	many of which are still 14 years later
4515000	4520000	in operation if that were to happen
4520000	4522000	again I think there should be a bend
4522000	4524000	not break strategies within central
4524000	4527000	banks and governments to maintain
4527000	4531000	transaction capacity and there's going
4531000	4533000	to have to be haircuts they're going to
4533000	4535000	have to be haircuts at banks people
4535000	4538000	won't be able to have own everything
4538000	4540000	that they think they own which is
4540000	4543000	itself an information hazard to talk
4543000	4546000	about on a podcast but this is not this
4546000	4549000	is popular in in earth sciences but in
4549000	4551000	the broader public sphere this isn't
4551000	4554000	that popular of a podcast all sorts of
4554000	4557000	things there that governments can
4557000	4561000	respond to the things that will make the
4561000	4564000	financial system more stable would break
4564000	4566000	the financial system right now this is
4566000	4568000	the problem we should have a carbon tax
4568000	4571000	the carbon tax would prick the bubble
4571000	4577000	of our debt fueled central bank led
4577000	4582000	orgy of consumption so I think
4582000	4586000	gradually if we were to put a small tax
4586000	4592000	on currency transactions gradually if
4592000	4596000	we had money creation that was tethered
4596000	4599000	to ecological services or pro-social
4599000	4602000	outcomes that's some aspect of what we
4602000	4606000	had kind of like a local currency but
4606000	4609000	at a national level have this I'm just
4609000	4611000	totally thinking out loud right now
4611000	4614000	have it have it generated in a way that
4614000	4617000	you can pay some portion of your taxes
4617000	4620000	in this parallel currency but that
4620000	4623000	parallel currency gets issued for doing
4623000	4626000	things aligned with the donut for
4626000	4630000	instance that minimizes our consumption
4630000	4633000	and keeps us within planetary boundaries
4633000	4637000	the that kind of makes sense in an
4637000	4640000	intermediate term in the short term
4640000	4643000	though here's the thing is the things
4643000	4646000	that would solve our financial overshoot
4646000	4648000	we're doing the exact opposite we're
4648000	4651000	doing more of those things that make the
4651000	4654000	bubble bigger which gets back to the
4654000	4658000	minsky thing so I think the way to
4658000	4660000	prepare for that is to prepare
4660000	4663000	individuals communities supply chains
4663000	4667000	businesses for disruption so that
4667000	4672000	they're not so beholden to a sudden
4672000	4675000	disruption in a material inputs from
4675000	4678000	across the world etc a reshoring of
4678000	4681000	basic needs and if that reshoring is
4681000	4684000	effective then the break scenario becomes
4684000	4687000	less likely I wish the Belgian
4687000	4690000	currency theorist Bernard Lietar was still
4690000	4693000	alive because I would have loved to hear
4693000	4696000	you have him on this podcast he just
4696000	4698000	recently died right he was on my list to
4698000	4702000	he died a few years ago yeah he was I
4702000	4705000	think the way he talked about the design
4705000	4707000	of money and the need for an ecosystem of
4707000	4711000	monies and currencies massively influenced
4711000	4713000	me and I would have just loved to hear
4713000	4716000	him contribute to the kind of designs
4716000	4718000	you were starting to come up with there
4718000	4721000	somebody who comes to my mind often with
4721000	4723000	this podcast is Stephanie Kelton one of
4723000	4726000	the leading theorists known in relation
4726000	4728000	to modern monetary theory and I would
4728000	4729000	just love to hear lots of people on
4729000	4731000	Twitter said I want to hear Nate talk
4731000	4732000	about modern monetary theory does he know
4732000	4734000	about it what does he think about it and
4734000	4736000	I really really hope you'll have her on
4736000	4738000	this podcast and you may profoundly
4738000	4740000	disagree but I think you'd really
4740000	4742000	respectfully listen and try and figure
4742000	4744000	out where's the overlap in your world
4744000	4746000	views or you may really agree but what
4746000	4748000	would be your take on modern monetary
4748000	4751000	theory right now I will answer that but
4751000	4755000	I'll preface it with this it is a
4755000	4757000	challenge and this is why I do the
4757000	4759000	franklies because a lot of my guests
4759000	4762000	first of all I invite people on that A
4762000	4765000	have some some credible expertise
4765000	4771000	on a thing and B that it's relevant to
4771000	4773000	the great simplification and C that
4773000	4777000	they're good people but what ends up
4777000	4780000	happening is a lot of times I agree
4780000	4783000	with my guests a lot on issue number
4783000	4786000	one and issue number two I totally
4786000	4789000	disagree with them but I can't spend
4789000	4792000	the whole I'm not a debater I don't
4792000	4797000	like want to stomp on their words and
4797000	4800000	try to disagree with people at every
4800000	4803000	point that I disagree with them so I've
4803000	4805000	learned and I've gotten better at this
4805000	4807000	over time I let the guest do 80 or 90
4807000	4809000	percent of the talking and then on my
4809000	4812000	franklies I kind of bookend it with
4812000	4815000	with my world view but it's it's
4815000	4817000	challenging and if you end up being a
4817000	4820000	host I'm sure you're so gracious and
4820000	4824000	diplomatic that that'll be not a problem
4824000	4828000	for you but I'm actually happy with that
4828000	4831000	because I'm kind of a talker my girlfriend
4831000	4833000	says it's my best skill as I just talk
4833000	4836000	so naturally I didn't naturally I have a
4836000	4839000	podcast but I've I have become a better
4839000	4842000	listener and who knows I may be really
4842000	4844000	wrong about some of these things and my
4844000	4846000	guests are absolutely right and that's
4846000	4850000	why the the universe of ideas and this
4850000	4852000	is in a sorts peer review in real time
4852000	4855000	of of talking and there's no way it can
4855000	4860000	be perfect but I do I am learning and
4860000	4863000	there are there are huge issues of
4863000	4868000	complexity that are present Stephanie
4868000	4870000	Kelton I've heard wonderful things about
4870000	4872000	her I have friends that know her I will
4872000	4875000	ask her to be on the show MMT I think of
4875000	4879000	as follows modern monetary theory
4879000	4883000	describes the money creation process
4883000	4886000	better than conventional financial theory
4886000	4891000	and it is true that a sovereign nation
4891000	4896000	doesn't really need to worry about their
4896000	4900000	debt because they can issue currency at
4900000	4904000	will and so I think the the the water
4904000	4910000	works of describing treasury debt
4910000	4916000	taxes money creation by MMT are correct
4916000	4921000	however MMT makes the same fatal flaw
4921000	4924000	as neoclassical economics on how it
4924000	4926000	treats energy productivity and
4926000	4929000	resources and when we create money we
4929000	4933000	are in balance in the world in the
4933000	4936000	monetary world but we're out of balance
4936000	4939000	both ecologically and specifically with
4939000	4941000	respect to the carbon pulse energy and
4941000	4943000	materials and when we create new money
4943000	4946000	we're not creating new copper or trees
4946000	4952000	or oil so I think the problem with MMT
4952000	4955000	is we end up at the same place with the
4955000	4958000	great simplification is we have
4958000	4960000	governments those governments that can
4960000	4962000	print their own money and that's another
4962000	4965000	thing that gets into the inequalities
4965000	4968000	and global disruptions because of using
4968000	4970000	the dollar as the reserve currency of
4970000	4972000	the world there's a lot of countries
4972000	4974000	that are tethered to the dollar and they
4974000	4976000	can't create their own dollars but we
4976000	4978000	can but I think we end up in the same
4978000	4980000	place is that we're creating too many
4980000	4982000	monetary claims versus an underlying
4982000	4985000	energy and material reality and that's
4985000	4987000	going to result in inflation and
4987000	4990000	eventually in the lack of trust in
4990000	4993000	other countries have towards a currency
4993000	4996000	as evidenced by the recent slight
4996000	4999000	downgrade in the US credit rating by
4999000	5003000	Moody's so is that a short enough
5003000	5006000	overview yeah that was that was just
5006000	5009000	the right length and it makes me all
5009000	5010000	the more look forward to hearing you and
5010000	5012000	Stephanie talk and I don't know what the
5012000	5014000	outcome would be but I think you know I
5014000	5015000	really appreciate talking about the
5015000	5017000	difference between the podcast where you
5017000	5019000	give space to the person you're
5019000	5021000	interviewing and I'm experiencing it
5021000	5023000	right now there's lots and lots of things
5023000	5025000	coming up I know I can imagine you would
5025000	5027000	see you're doing a great job because you
5027000	5029000	probably would want to be pushing back
5029000	5031000	on a lot of the things I'm saying it's
5031000	5033000	hard right because you push back on
5033000	5035000	everything it would be a four-hour
5035000	5038000	conversation there we go and you think
5038000	5040000	okay I'll let that go I'll let that go
5040000	5042000	but I'm gonna follow this thread so I
5042000	5044000	understand that and but here's the other
5044000	5046000	thing Kate is you and I are close friends
5046000	5049000	so we could go back and forth and
5049000	5051000	respectfully disagree with each other
5051000	5053000	and learn but some of these guests I've
5053000	5056000	never met before and I had one and for
5056000	5060000	me to say come on are you serious to
5060000	5062000	someone I just met that's just not my
5062000	5065000	golden retriever Midwest upbringing
5065000	5067000	it's really helpful to hear you articulate
5067000	5070000	the reason for the franklies around on
5070000	5072000	right on the side and that that's a very
5072000	5074000	nice like your little kind of release
5074000	5077000	valve on the side but yeah I was going
5077000	5079000	to say I wonder if you could sometimes
5079000	5082000	invite people who you've already
5082000	5083000	interviewed or you've got to know and
5083000	5085000	you and just have a session we say we
5085000	5088000	respectfully disagree let's celebrate
5088000	5090000	that isn't that interesting I respect
5090000	5092000	you but I really disagree with your view
5092000	5095000	on that I just wish there was more
5095000	5096000	debate in the world that just said hey
5096000	5098000	let's celebrate we respectfully disagree
5098000	5101000	let's listen and find the edges of our
5101000	5103000	own understanding without trying to
5103000	5104000	win this we're all trying to move
5104000	5106000	forward so anyway just a thought I think
5106000	5108000	you could you could bring some of those
5108000	5110000	into the podcast in the future I'm going
5110000	5112000	to keep us moving so we're leaning into
5112000	5115000	the possibility of Bend and I'm looking
5115000	5117000	forward to the episode that you do in the
5117000	5118000	future with Stephanie Kelton because I
5118000	5120000	think and I think a lot of people would
5120000	5123000	love to hear that do you know her I do
5123000	5125000	Stephanie you've got to come on this
5125000	5128000	podcast okay okay we're going to move to
5128000	5131000	education and you teach and are well
5131000	5135000	aware of the power of teaching and that
5135000	5137000	moment where students are in brought into
5137000	5140000	a world view so I want to know from you
5140000	5143000	if we are going to Bend at the systemic
5143000	5146000	level what do you think needs to change
5146000	5148000	in the world of education in terms of
5148000	5150000	the concepts that are taught in terms of
5150000	5152000	the kind of skills that the students
5152000	5154000	are taught what it means to be well
5154000	5156000	educated for the 21st century and you
5156000	5158000	can answer this across any discipline
5158000	5160000	you choose or even beyond academia but
5160000	5162000	what needs to change in the way we
5162000	5165000	educate this generation
5165000	5168000	almost everything needs to change and
5168000	5170000	just to clarify I stopped teaching three
5170000	5172000	years ago because I was I was just too
5172000	5174000	busy with other things but I did teach
5174000	5176000	for eight years and I miss it it was the
5176000	5179000	most rewarding thing I've ever done and
5179000	5182000	per my message I left you I'm happy to
5182000	5184000	guess lecture your your class in the
5184000	5186000	future
5186000	5188000	I'm actually trying to construct a
5188000	5190000	roundtable maybe you would like to be
5190000	5192000	part of it
5192000	5195000	Jean-Marc Giancovici and Simon Michaud
5195000	5198000	and Sandra Faber who's a
5198000	5201000	physicist and ask them how do we need
5201000	5204000	to change it the academy what are the
5204000	5206000	questions that we should be asking
5206000	5208000	postdocs and graduate students for their
5208000	5210000	research ahead of the great
5210000	5213000	simplification I think there's so many
5213000	5216000	aspects of the education system that
5216000	5219000	are tethered to the super organism and
5219000	5222000	energy and systems blind that we
5222000	5225000	really need to change
5225000	5228000	probably all levels of education I think
5228000	5230000	we need to start teaching ecology and
5230000	5233000	systems to grade schoolers
5233000	5235000	because it by the time they get to
5235000	5238000	college age my my students they
5238000	5240000	haven't learned a lot of of these
5240000	5242000	basics
5242000	5245000	what are colleges now we were
5245000	5247000	supposed to back in the day have a
5247000	5249000	liberal education so that everyone
5249000	5251000	understood a little bit about how the
5251000	5253000	world work but over time
5253000	5255000	they've morphed into came done with
5255000	5257000	high school now to get a higher paying
5257000	5259000	job I have to get this degree it's less
5259000	5261000	about learning as it is to get a rubber
5261000	5264000	stamp of I got this degree now I can
5264000	5266000	make 25% more money
5266000	5268000	and I think we're going to need more
5268000	5270000	education on
5270000	5272000	how to human how to
5272000	5274000	be a human
5274000	5276000	which includes your psychological
5276000	5278000	spiritual emotional physical
5278000	5280000	well-being
5280000	5282000	we don't teach that at all that's going
5282000	5284000	to be central in this world of
5284000	5286000	deteriorating mental health
5286000	5288000	how do we have skills that are
5288000	5290000	actually going to apply to
5290000	5292000	the future that we're headed towards
5292000	5294000	and how do you understand
5294000	5296000	the systems ecology of the world
5296000	5298000	sure math
5298000	5300000	is important
5300000	5302000	but you know the
5302000	5304000	ecology and history and brain
5304000	5306000	science and anthropology
5306000	5308000	and just
5308000	5310000	I mean
5310000	5312000	the topics I cover in my course reality
5312000	5314000	101 that should be kind of
5314000	5316000	a 101
5316000	5318000	for all freshmen to understand
5318000	5320000	the world we face
5320000	5322000	so
5322000	5324000	and to go right back to where we began
5324000	5326000	with energy blindness I guess
5326000	5328000	you'd say there's got to be an energy
5328000	5330000	what eyes wide open
5330000	5332000	education that everybody should
5332000	5334000	learn to
5334000	5336000	see sense and be aware
5336000	5338000	of
5338000	5340000	deep dependence upon the flows of energy in the
5340000	5342000	world because it's if it's the currency of life
5342000	5344000	we better get with it
5344000	5346000	yeah
5346000	5348000	I mean
5348000	5350000	one of the complaints
5350000	5352000	my students complained to
5352000	5354000	me and to the dean that at the end
5354000	5356000	of the semester I taught them all kinds
5356000	5358000	of things about how the world worked and how
5358000	5360000	messed up it was but I didn't
5360000	5362000	give an answer
5362000	5364000	and they were paid
5364000	5366000	to learn and have the answer
5366000	5368000	but I didn't have an answer and he was very upset
5368000	5370000	about that
5370000	5372000	I don't think there are answers
5372000	5374000	but we have to empower young
5374000	5376000	people with
5376000	5378000	not a rose tinted
5378000	5380000	but an actual view of our reality
5380000	5382000	to
5382000	5384000	in a way that we pass the baton to them
5384000	5386000	in an encouraging and empowering way
5386000	5388000	to do things
5388000	5390000	but I do think it's a disservice
5390000	5392000	to
5392000	5394000	shovel the uncomfortable aspects under the
5394000	5396000	carpet and ignore them because they're too
5396000	5398000	young and they can't handle that
5398000	5400000	I don't subscribe to that
5400000	5402000	and just picking up on that question of
5402000	5404000	you didn't give an answer
5404000	5406000	I mean I've heard you say before
5406000	5408000	also in relation to this podcast
5408000	5410000	and in relation to
5410000	5412000	the world view you bring forward
5412000	5414000	it's more, I said
5414000	5416000	I experience it more as a
5416000	5418000	this is what I see
5418000	5420000	this is the context I see
5420000	5422000	I'm trying to explain the system
5422000	5424000	that I see that we're in
5424000	5426000	but you sit much more there
5426000	5428000	and here's how I think we should solve it
5428000	5430000	is that a fair description
5430000	5432000	of the place in this ecosystem
5432000	5434000	of making things visible
5434000	5436000	and the solution to sit
5436000	5438000	Yes, but if you squint
5438000	5440000	and look forward
5440000	5442000	it's kind of obvious
5442000	5444000	what the direction of the things
5444000	5446000	we're going to need to do and a lot of the things
5446000	5448000	are in your work
5448000	5450000	on the donut
5450000	5452000	we're going to need to live
5452000	5454000	instead of just as individual
5454000	5456000	lone wolves we're going to have to
5456000	5458000	expand our interaction
5458000	5460000	with others social capital is
5460000	5462000	critically important
5462000	5464000	and we're going to have to
5464000	5466000	probably have less
5466000	5468000	material consumption
5468000	5470000	and how to prepare for that ahead of time
5470000	5472000	and prepare for that in your communities
5472000	5474000	I mean how we get from here
5474000	5476000	to there could happen multiple
5476000	5478000	different ways
5478000	5480000	next week I have
5480000	5482000	a round table on poverty
5482000	5484000	and I think
5484000	5486000	there's great inequality
5486000	5488000	in the world between countries
5488000	5490000	but there's even larger inequality
5490000	5492000	in countries including my country
5492000	5494000	and your country
5494000	5496000	and I think that's going to be a huge
5496000	5498000	story in the next decade
5498000	5500000	is the amount of
5500000	5502000	haves
5502000	5504000	the amount of have nots
5504000	5506000	is going to increase a lot
5506000	5508000	we're going to have wider and deeper poverty
5508000	5510000	and of course we'll try to
5510000	5512000	overcome that
5512000	5514000	with stimulus and social
5514000	5516000	programs but eventually there will be limits
5516000	5518000	to that so how do we
5518000	5520000	where does college fit in
5520000	5522000	with that? Is it even the best
5522000	5524000	choice
5524000	5526000	for an 18 year old
5526000	5528000	headed into this world
5528000	5530000	but yeah you're right I'm more
5530000	5532000	trying to describe our situation
5532000	5534000	in a politically neutral
5534000	5536000	science tethered way
5536000	5538000	and pass that
5538000	5540000	baton to as many humans that
5540000	5542000	will listen
5542000	5544000	which is another issue Kate
5544000	5546000	this podcast is not for everyone
5546000	5548000	I could
5548000	5550000	with more funding
5550000	5552000	broadcast it so that I paid
5552000	5554000	for social media views and got
5554000	5556000	a lot more people to watch it
5556000	5558000	and this is not a message
5558000	5560000	for everyone that is
5560000	5562000	I want to force on people
5562000	5564000	it's kind of a low bandwidth
5564000	5566000	bat signal that I'm sending out to the world
5566000	5568000	and those people that resonate
5568000	5570000	with it
5570000	5572000	those are my sort of people
5572000	5574000	and I want to be as honest as I can
5574000	5576000	be in what I think
5576000	5578000	with them there's a completely
5578000	5580000	different set of messaging
5580000	5582000	that needs to happen
5582000	5584000	for the general public, for students
5584000	5586000	for community leaders, for Hollywood
5586000	5588000	for governments
5588000	5590000	and that's more than I can handle
5590000	5592000	at the moment but messaging
5592000	5594000	is very important
5594000	5596000	and I'm just trying to be
5596000	5598000	authentic and describe
5598000	5600000	what I see now
5600000	5602000	and maybe I should do more thought
5602000	5604000	in crafting
5604000	5606000	discrete pathways
5606000	5608000	that are helpful to people
5608000	5610000	and of course there are people
5610000	5612000	among students and community leaders
5612000	5614000	and Hollywood and political leaders
5614000	5616000	who are your listeners of this podcast
5616000	5618000	and maybe they are also
5618000	5620000	taking it and translating it
5620000	5622000	or making it accessible to their communities
5622000	5624000	in ways that only they
5624000	5626000	from within that community know
5626000	5628000	how that will fly
5628000	5630000	that actually is my deepest hope
5630000	5632000	is that I don't know
5632000	5634000	how these conversations
5634000	5636000	are changing the actions and behaviors
5636000	5638000	and emergence of others
5638000	5640000	I do have another call, a second call next week
5640000	5642000	with an executive at HBO
5642000	5644000	that wants to do a series
5644000	5646000	on the great simplification
5646000	5648000	writ large, like a six part series
5648000	5650000	and we're kind of talking
5650000	5652000	about what that might look like
5652000	5654000	so yeah, the time now
5654000	5656000	is for this cultural conversation
5656000	5658000	and it's not just climate
5658000	5660000	and it's not just
5660000	5662000	politics, it's
5662000	5664000	a large
5664000	5666000	systems, human
5666000	5668000	species level
5668000	5670000	conversation
5670000	5672000	and
5672000	5674000	you and I are part of that
5674000	5676000	conversation and it's evolving
5676000	5678000	and I'm going to break around
5678000	5680000	to ways that we could lean
5680000	5682000	into the possibility of Bend
5682000	5684000	okay, you've shared what you'd say
5684000	5686000	about changing education, what about changing
5686000	5688000	and this is massively broad
5688000	5690000	but what about changing
5690000	5692000	policy making
5692000	5694000	just think of policy makers
5694000	5696000	in
5696000	5698000	a country, I'm going to start with a country
5698000	5700000	in the global north
5700000	5702000	they're involved in
5702000	5704000	industry or sector
5704000	5706000	that is material and energy intensive
5708000	5710000	and they came to you and said
5710000	5712000	how can I start
5712000	5714000	changing to help Bend
5714000	5716000	what can I
5716000	5718000	think differently, do different tools, language
5718000	5720000	world view
5720000	5722000	I know this is a massive question
5722000	5724000	what can you see that could start
5724000	5726000	helping if there was
5726000	5728000	if we believe that this couldn't fail then critical
5728000	5730000	mass could actually build amongst policy makers
5730000	5732000	what would you want to see a critical mass
5732000	5734000	of building
5734000	5736000	it is a massive question
5736000	5738000	in fact every question you've
5738000	5740000	asked me could be its own one hour
5740000	5742000	podcast
5742000	5744000	I've included that
5744000	5746000	policies that actually could
5746000	5748000	be implemented right now
5748000	5750000	are only at the margin
5750000	5752000	the conversation that needs to happen
5752000	5754000	is so, so much bigger
5754000	5756000	on what we're going to have to do in the next decade
5756000	5758000	so I coined the phrase
5758000	5760000	advanced policy which is those things
5760000	5762000	that we will have to do
5762000	5764000	but that are politically and
5764000	5766000	socially unacceptable now
5766000	5768000	and so the biggest thing
5768000	5770000	is to educate
5770000	5772000	the current leaders and future leaders
5772000	5774000	as possible about how
5774000	5776000	these pieces fit together
5776000	5778000	and
5778000	5780000	build constituency and research
5780000	5782000	and work on what
5782000	5784000	they will have to do
5784000	5786000	when we go into energy
5786000	5788000	security and rationing
5788000	5790000	and
5790000	5792000	the early stages of the simplification
5792000	5794000	in the global north now that's
5794000	5796000	a different answer for corporations
5796000	5798000	and businesses
5798000	5800000	that would have more to do with
5800000	5802000	I mean here's the thing
5802000	5804000	we
5804000	5806000	so revere efficiency today
5806000	5808000	but
5808000	5810000	efficiency makes things less resilient
5810000	5812000	and
5812000	5814000	on the downslope once the economy
5814000	5816000	starts to decline
5816000	5818000	efficiency
5818000	5820000	the Jevons paradox will become a Jevons
5820000	5822000	dividend because if we
5822000	5824000	get 5% more
5824000	5826000	efficiency in how we use energy
5826000	5828000	that means whatever our
5828000	5830000	decline is is 5% less
5830000	5832000	so
5832000	5834000	the challenge now is
5834000	5836000	to look two or three steps ahead
5836000	5838000	on what are the technologies
5838000	5840000	that society are going to need
5840000	5842000	in the next 10 or 20 years
5842000	5844000	and start
5844000	5846000	looking at that instead
5846000	5848000	of what consumers are demanding now
5848000	5850000	but how do you do that
5850000	5852000	I mean it's really hard
5852000	5854000	because your market is what
5854000	5856000	people are buying today
5856000	5858000	so I come back to
5858000	5860000	education
5860000	5862000	and systems
5862000	5864000	are the no regret strategies
5864000	5866000	and I mean you're doing fantastic
5866000	5868000	work with deal
5868000	5870000	and donut on the ground
5870000	5872000	in cities
5872000	5874000	I just don't see that we're going to
5874000	5876000	get off of
5876000	5878000	fossil carbon because of ammonia
5878000	5880000	and cement and
5880000	5882000	concrete and fertilizers and all the
5882000	5884000	other things
5884000	5886000	but to prepare for less
5886000	5888000	and less intricate global
5888000	5890000	supply chains
5890000	5892000	is something to be considered
5892000	5894000	I've talked to a lot of politicians
5894000	5896000	and this is like too big
5896000	5898000	of a thing for them to bite off
5898000	5900000	so
5900000	5902000	but I think it
5902000	5904000	five years ago this sounded crazy
5904000	5906000	and now they're nodding their heads
5906000	5908000	starting to listen
5908000	5910000	is there anything that you think
5910000	5912000	people are already doing
5912000	5914000	right
5914000	5916000	towards
5916000	5918000	bending
5918000	5920000	at least that's in motion
5920000	5922000	at least that's building mass
5922000	5924000	well I think psychologically
5924000	5926000	there are millions
5926000	5928000	or tens of millions of people
5928000	5930000	that are already
5930000	5932000	the walking worried that
5932000	5934000	know that our culture is approaching
5934000	5936000	an inflection point
5936000	5938000	and so they're
5938000	5940000	supportive
5940000	5942000	they're doing things
5942000	5944000	more locally
5944000	5946000	they're meeting their neighbors
5946000	5948000	they're maybe growing a little food
5948000	5950000	I mean this is without understanding
5950000	5952000	climate change or oil depletion
5952000	5954000	or debt overshoot or anything
5954000	5956000	they're just
5956000	5958000	responding
5958000	5960000	from the cultural signals
5960000	5962000	I mean you're probably a better person
5962000	5964000	to ask that question
5964000	5966000	look at all the on the ground
5966000	5968000	I think that the biggest thing
5968000	5970000	is that we're starting to talk
5970000	5972000	about this in lots
5972000	5974000	of different places
5974000	5976000	and that talking kind of breaks the seal
5976000	5978000	of creativity
5978000	5980000	and working together
5980000	5982000	and different
5982000	5984000	different projects
5984000	5986000	it's just that little flame
5986000	5988000	is so tiny relative
5988000	5990000	to the media and
5990000	5992000	the cultural conversation
5992000	5994000	and the Super Bowl
5994000	5996000	and the advertising on TV
5996000	5998000	that you need to buy
5998000	6000000	this extra little thing
6000000	6002000	for your house and you'll be happy
6002000	6004000	so I think
6004000	6006000	many of us are growing up
6006000	6008000	and waking up
6008000	6010000	to our reality
6010000	6012000	and
6012000	6014000	I think that itself is a good thing
6014000	6016000	and needs to continue to scale
6016000	6018000	by the way
6018000	6020000	this is
6020000	6022000	this is
6022000	6024000	a darker conversation
6024000	6026000	than I anticipated
6026000	6028000	is it not
6028000	6030000	it feels like I'm kind of a curmudgeon
6030000	6032000	here
6032000	6034000	I'm not trying to put you in a curmudgeon corner
6034000	6036000	I'm inviting you
6036000	6038000	to talk about the possibility of bend
6038000	6040000	yeah well
6040000	6042000	but that's where you okay
6042000	6044000	that's interesting that's where you are today
6044000	6046000	yeah it's where I am today
6046000	6048000	but I mean I also
6048000	6050000	who am I
6050000	6052000	Kate to tell
6052000	6054000	people how I think
6054000	6056000	that what they should do
6056000	6058000	I also
6058000	6060000	feel like
6060000	6062000	I do understand how the system
6062000	6064000	fits together and I've spent a lot of time
6064000	6066000	on biophysical economics
6066000	6068000	but that doesn't qualify me to be some
6068000	6070000	advice person
6070000	6072000	for people's lives
6072000	6074000	I know the general direction
6074000	6076000	because I'm still
6076000	6078000	trying to figure out what to do in my own life
6078000	6080000	okay
6080000	6082000	I'm just going to pick up
6082000	6084000	there something I was going to bring later
6084000	6086000	who might
6086000	6088000	be an advice person
6088000	6090000	and I hear you saying
6090000	6092000	I'm witnessing I'm just saying what I'm seeing
6092000	6094000	but I don't want to be giving advice
6094000	6096000	but I'm going to come back to
6096000	6098000	I want to come into the place of the difference between
6098000	6100000	the podcast and the franklies
6100000	6102000	and you've explained a little bit
6102000	6104000	quite clearly actually the difference
6104000	6106000	and the reason for both and that makes sense
6106000	6108000	to me
6108000	6110000	but your franklies are sometimes very strong
6110000	6112000	like very strong opinion
6112000	6114000	and you might not be giving advice
6114000	6116000	but the strength in which
6116000	6118000	with which you give your opinion
6118000	6120000	influences people
6120000	6122000	and it shapes
6122000	6124000	many people's
6124000	6126000	perception of what is or isn't possible
6126000	6128000	so it has a big effect in the world
6128000	6130000	and I just want to
6130000	6132000	lean into that a little bit more
6132000	6134000	to ask you
6134000	6136000	to hold that
6136000	6138000	this is my opinion
6138000	6140000	and you know that you've got a big audience
6140000	6142000	this is my opinion and sometimes
6142000	6144000	for many people it can feel very dark
6144000	6146000	like well we're just going to keep using the oil
6146000	6148000	whereas so many people are
6148000	6150000	mobilizing in every way they can
6150000	6152000	to move us off that
6152000	6154000	and to move us into not renewables
6154000	6156000	but solar based energies
6156000	6158000	it feels very
6158000	6160000	heavy
6160000	6162000	to hear you say
6162000	6164000	keep using it up
6164000	6166000	and I just want to ask you how you hold
6166000	6168000	knowing that it is influential
6168000	6170000	and it might not be advocacy and advising
6170000	6172000	but it has impact on
6172000	6174000	people's sense of what's possible
6174000	6176000	I do have a strong opinion
6176000	6178000	of the global macro
6178000	6180000	economy
6180000	6182000	and I actually don't think that
6182000	6184000	the tragedy is we're going to use
6184000	6186000	more oil
6186000	6188000	per se I think it's
6188000	6190000	the economy unwinding
6190000	6192000	to prepare for
6192000	6194000	and we are going to use less oil
6194000	6196000	because we won't be able to afford it
6196000	6198000	I think that's the default path
6198000	6200000	the franklies
6202000	6204000	if I had my druthers
6204000	6206000	I would do one a day
6206000	6208000	and I have hundreds of topics
6208000	6210000	that I would like to
6210000	6212000	opine on
6212000	6214000	and it's interesting Kate
6214000	6216000	something really strange has happened
6216000	6218000	since I started doing these franklies
6218000	6220000	I go for like a bike ride
6220000	6222000	or a walk
6222000	6224000	and I organize things in my head
6224000	6226000	and I come back right here
6226000	6228000	and I turn the camera on and I just riff
6228000	6230000	and 9 times out of 10 that's the final thing
6230000	6232000	and sometimes I say something
6232000	6234000	and my staff is like no you can't say that
6234000	6236000	you need to redo it
6236000	6238000	but I've gotten better at speaking
6238000	6240000	in like 15 minute
6240000	6242000	extemp summaries
6242000	6244000	but I can no longer write
6244000	6246000	I've lost the ability to
6246000	6248000	dense those thoughts into
6248000	6250000	you know
6250000	6252000	1500 word essay
6252000	6254000	and so this
6254000	6256000	it's like working out certain muscles
6256000	6258000	I've been talking on this
6258000	6260000	podcast and these franklies
6260000	6262000	but I think the franklies
6262000	6264000	at their core
6264000	6266000	are a systems integration
6266000	6268000	of multiple topics
6268000	6270000	that I've spent 20 years thinking
6270000	6272000	about and researching
6272000	6274000	and talking to other experts
6274000	6276000	and so it's where the disciplines
6276000	6278000	overlap
6278000	6280000	and merge is where the discovery
6280000	6282000	and interesting things are
6282000	6284000	okay
6284000	6286000	here's a question you invited me to ask
6286000	6288000	which I appreciate
6288000	6290000	where might you be wrong
6292000	6294000	I asked you to ask me that
6294000	6296000	yeah you did
6296000	6298000	I think I want to start asking that of all my guests
6298000	6300000	you absolutely should
6300000	6302000	I think that's a great idea
6302000	6304000	um
6306000	6308000	when I ran
6308000	6310000	the oil drum and now that
6310000	6312000	I run this podcast I get emails
6312000	6314000	from so many people
6314000	6316000	that are all so
6316000	6318000	unbelievably sure about
6318000	6320000	their world view
6320000	6322000	and I think it's part of the human condition
6322000	6324000	especially with
6324000	6326000	middle-aged and older men
6326000	6328000	that they have this
6328000	6330000	unbelievable certitude
6330000	6332000	of their world view and their opinion
6332000	6334000	and I think that is part of the human condition
6334000	6336000	and I'm a middle-aged
6336000	6338000	older man and therefore
6338000	6340000	I have to recognizing that
6340000	6342000	handicap my certitude by some amount
6342000	6344000	I feel
6344000	6346000	confident about these things
6346000	6348000	but I know that humans are
6348000	6350000	oftentimes delusional
6350000	6352000	and don't actually see
6352000	6354000	things that they can't see
6356000	6358000	so I'm sure that I'm wrong
6358000	6360000	about many many
6360000	6362000	things in what I'm talking
6362000	6364000	about at the
6364000	6366000	margin because I'm trying to stay on top
6366000	6368000	of neuroscience and plastics
6368000	6370000	and oil depletion and things
6370000	6372000	are moving so fast that I can't
6372000	6374000	stay up
6374000	6376000	on the core things I really don't think
6376000	6378000	I'm wrong because I've
6378000	6380000	looked at them so many times
6380000	6382000	humans are biological
6382000	6384000	organisms were
6384000	6386000	mammals were primates were
6386000	6388000	predators were related to
6388000	6390000	all other things
6390000	6392000	that are alive on the planet
6392000	6394000	and we're a product of our evolutionary
6394000	6396000	past and that has a bearing on our behaviors
6396000	6398000	I don't think
6398000	6400000	I'm wrong about that energy is
6400000	6402000	the currency of life and how much
6402000	6404000	net energy we have access to
6404000	6406000	dictates what's possible
6406000	6408000	in the human sphere and this
6408000	6410000	energy that we've been using
6410000	6412000	is depleting
6412000	6414000	and we've been
6414000	6416000	alive during a part where it was
6416000	6418000	growing not depleting
6418000	6420000	and so we're
6420000	6422000	immune to the imagination of
6422000	6424000	what can happen afterward I don't know
6424000	6426000	what's going to happen afterward
6426000	6428000	but I can infer it
6428000	6430000	and most importantly
6430000	6432000	the natural world
6432000	6434000	is being
6434000	6436000	severely impacted by the human
6436000	6438000	endeavor and
6438000	6440000	this is kind of a shifting baseline
6440000	6442000	sort of thing we don't see it
6442000	6444000	every day every day looks much like
6444000	6446000	yesterday but over decades and over
6446000	6448000	centuries it is absolutely
6448000	6450000	deteriorating
6450000	6452000	relative to the way it was
6452000	6454000	I don't think I'm wrong
6454000	6456000	about those larger
6456000	6458000	arcs
6458000	6460000	but I definitely could be wrong about some
6460000	6462000	things for instance what is the role of
6462000	6464000	technology
6464000	6466000	what is the role of governance
6466000	6468000	what is the role of cultural evolution
6468000	6470000	I don't think I'm
6470000	6472000	really wrong about those things because
6472000	6474000	I'm not deterministic in what they will
6474000	6476000	be
6476000	6478000	I am
6478000	6480000	still learning Kate
6482000	6484000	aren't we all
6484000	6486000	and since you talked about
6486000	6488000	your own identity
6488000	6490000	in this I'm just going to come in on that
6490000	6492000	here's me a white British woman sitting at
6492000	6494000	Oxford in the United Kingdom
6494000	6496000	and there's you
6496000	6498000	white presenting North American man
6498000	6500000	in the US
6500000	6502000	what do you think
6502000	6504000	that there may be
6504000	6506000	things that people like you and I can't
6506000	6508000	see that are trends in the world
6508000	6510000	that matter in the world
6510000	6512000	just some reflections on what
6512000	6514000	other people dissimilar
6514000	6516000	from us might know or be able
6516000	6518000	to see or sense that we can't see
6518000	6520000	now that's a kind of tricky question
6520000	6522000	tell me what you can see that you can't see
6522000	6524000	but you get where I'm going
6524000	6526000	fortunately I have a lot of friends
6526000	6528000	internationally many of them
6528000	6530000	have been guests in this show and I hope to do
6530000	6532000	more international
6532000	6534000	guests in next year
6534000	6536000	that this
6536000	6538000	everyone has a different
6538000	6540000	perspective and what they care about
6540000	6542000	is different and I think we need to hear
6542000	6544000	a lot more
6544000	6546000	voices on how people
6546000	6548000	process this and how they respond
6548000	6550000	to it this is one
6550000	6552000	of my biggest challenges right now there's
6552000	6554000	38% of the listeners of this
6554000	6556000	show are in the United States
6556000	6558000	which means 62%
6558000	6560000	are in other countries
6560000	6562000	I live in the
6562000	6564000	United States my social connections
6564000	6566000	are largely here when I talk
6566000	6568000	about bend versus break
6568000	6570000	and the great simplification
6570000	6572000	ostensibly I mean for this
6572000	6574000	country because we are
6574000	6576000	totally unprepared for what's coming
6576000	6578000	and yet there are people
6578000	6580000	in Kenya and Ethiopia
6580000	6582000	and Lebanon
6582000	6584000	and Ukraine listening
6584000	6586000	and watching this podcast I know
6586000	6588000	because they email me
6588000	6590000	and the message for them might be totally
6590000	6592000	different than the message for people
6592000	6594000	living in Minneapolis or Topeka, Kansas
6594000	6596000	and so I
6596000	6598000	really struggle with that
6598000	6600000	and I want to stay on
6600000	6602000	target of how does this
6602000	6604000	system science fit together
6604000	6606000	of our predicament
6606000	6608000	and what are the behavioral policy
6608000	6610000	economic
6610000	6612000	and biological ways out of it
6612000	6614000	but I also want to
6614000	6616000	like you said I want to highlight
6616000	6618000	the voices that can
6618000	6620000	see things about this that
6620000	6622000	a biophysical economist could not
6622000	6624000	and I'll need help
6624000	6626000	on finding those voices
6626000	6628000	but I hear you
6628000	6630000	on that
6630000	6632000	Yeah and just reflecting that
6632000	6634000	for my own economics education
6634000	6636000	economics was founded on the
6636000	6638000	worldviews of
6638000	6640000	people from the global north with land
6640000	6642000	and so they saw some things
6642000	6644000	and they missed a heck of a lot of things
6644000	6646000	and in my own
6646000	6648000	rethinking of economics
6648000	6650000	it's been when you go to other people
6650000	6652000	from the global south from women's voices
6652000	6654000	from working class backgrounds
6654000	6656000	people who come from elsewhere
6656000	6658000	where those economists where they just bring
6658000	6660000	that 360 degree completely other perspective
6660000	6662000	and as you said earlier
6662000	6664000	like none of us can know
6664000	6666000	everything none of us can see everything
6666000	6668000	it takes that ecosystem
6668000	6670000	of using experience to help
6670000	6672000	fill in the gaps
6672000	6674000	of our own understanding
6674000	6676000	our ability to empathize or learn
6676000	6678000	about other places so
6678000	6680000	here's to ecosystems of knowledge
6680000	6682000	and podcasts right back to the value of a podcast
6682000	6684000	just so many different voices
6684000	6686000	I can definitely think
6686000	6688000	of people you could invite on
6688000	6690000	who would bring much more of that perspective
6690000	6692000	and I'm sure many of your listeners can too
6692000	6694000	so
6694000	6696000	can you move us towards the classic closing questions
6696000	6698000	okay the questions that you
6698000	6700000	ask people every week
6700000	6702000	and make sense to ask them to you
6702000	6704000	are you ready
6704000	6706000	yes
6706000	6708000	okay
6708000	6710000	what would be
6710000	6712000	a practical response to the metacrisis
6712000	6714000	that would be most effective
6714000	6716000	for people to take
6720000	6722000	Nate that's a really big question
6722000	6724000	do you ask people that
6724000	6726000	just like straight off the bat
6726000	6728000	do you feel how massive that is
6736000	6738000	well this is why I do that
6738000	6740000	is because
6740000	6742000	everyone has a factual
6742000	6744000	expertise Helen Thompson
6744000	6746000	was on last week talking about
6746000	6748000	money and energy
6748000	6750000	and geopolitics
6750000	6752000	and she gets asked those personal things
6752000	6754000	and I frankly don't know what she thinks
6754000	6756000	about the great simplification
6756000	6758000	other than she specifically
6758000	6760000	predicts energy
6760000	6762000	security problems
6762000	6764000	in the next five years
6764000	6766000	so I like to
6766000	6768000	I mean my belief is
6768000	6770000	we're headed for a time
6770000	6772000	when we need to have
6772000	6774000	the head, the heart and the hands
6774000	6776000	acting in unison
6776000	6778000	and so much of the podcast
6778000	6780000	sphere is about the head
6780000	6782000	you know analyzing things
6782000	6784000	so I
6784000	6786000	append these questions
6786000	6788000	at the end of the interviews
6788000	6790000	to get at the heart
6790000	6792000	of the human that is on the show
6792000	6794000	nice
6794000	6796000	because I think our humanity
6796000	6798000	and
6798000	6800000	our honesty and our care
6800000	6802000	and who we are as individuals
6802000	6804000	is going to be as
6804000	6806000	or even more important than the facts
6806000	6808000	we know about the world
6808000	6810000	so that's why I asked those
6810000	6812000	and I'm thinking about mixing them up
6812000	6814000	a little because it's been a hundred episodes
6814000	6816000	but
6816000	6818000	we do get really interesting
6818000	6820000	answers
6820000	6822000	what do we do about the metacrisis
6822000	6824000	it depends where you are
6824000	6826000	I think the I mean I have a hundred
6826000	6828000	pieces of advice
6828000	6830000	but the main one
6830000	6832000	is
6832000	6834000	try to not go through
6834000	6836000	this
6836000	6838000	as an individual
6838000	6840000	find a group of like-minded people
6840000	6842000	on your values
6842000	6844000	find a group of like-minded people
6844000	6846000	on
6846000	6848000	doing things
6848000	6850000	meeting the future halfway in your community
6850000	6852000	or in your company
6852000	6854000	or in your neighborhood
6854000	6856000	and find a group of people that
6856000	6858000	you like to have fun with
6858000	6860000	and do things that are unrelated to the metacrisis
6860000	6862000	and feed your soul
6862000	6864000	those groups, those three groups
6864000	6866000	end up being the same group of five or six
6866000	6868000	or seven friends or maybe they're different
6868000	6870000	but finding
6870000	6872000	the dining car on this
6872000	6874000	runaway train
6874000	6876000	with like-minded people
6876000	6878000	is an important thing to do
6880000	6882000	one of my problems is
6882000	6884000	I eat, sleep and breathe
6884000	6886000	the metacrisis, my girlfriend now
6886000	6888000	I have a rule that if I'm on the phone call
6888000	6890000	with
6890000	6892000	a group of people
6892000	6894000	Daniel or
6894000	6896000	DJ White or Rex Weiler
6896000	6898000	or Art Berman
6898000	6900000	I have to leave the house
6900000	6902000	she's tired of hearing about this stuff
6902000	6904000	and I don't blame her
6904000	6906000	so
6906000	6908000	try to have balance as well
6908000	6910000	and I think
6910000	6912000	there's a lot of things that are out of our control
6912000	6914000	so that means
6914000	6916000	try to control one or two things
6916000	6918000	about your future
6918000	6920000	and I try to do that
6920000	6922000	and I think ultimately
6922000	6924000	where we are as a culture
6924000	6926000	what
6926000	6928000	really needs to change is a culture
6928000	6930000	which is to
6930000	6932000	recognize that most of this consumption
6932000	6934000	is
6934000	6936000	not making us healthy
6936000	6938000	or happy
6938000	6940000	and that once basic needs
6940000	6942000	are met the best things in life
6942000	6944000	are mostly free
6944000	6946000	and for a lot of people the basic needs aren't being met
6946000	6948000	if we look at the macro things
6948000	6950000	of what our society needs to do
6950000	6952000	we can start
6952000	6954000	to attempt to try to change those things
6954000	6956000	in our own life and you see how
6956000	6958000	difficult it is
6958000	6960000	to reduce the
6960000	6962000	siren song
6962000	6964000	of immediate gratification
6964000	6966000	with either food or entertainment
6966000	6968000	or novelty or stimulus
6968000	6970000	and do the longer term
6970000	6972000	thing like reading a book
6972000	6974000	or planting something or tending a garden
6974000	6976000	and so
6976000	6978000	if we really want to live more sustainably
6978000	6980000	as a culture I think that
6980000	6982000	starts within
6982000	6984000	and that's a struggle for me
6984000	6986000	that I'm going through all the time
6986000	6988000	so
6988000	6990000	I'm sure people have heard me talk a lot
6990000	6992000	about what I recommend
6992000	6994000	and I'll have more stuff but that's a
6994000	6996000	short response
6996000	6998000	Okay and specifically what recommendations
6998000	7000000	for young humans
7000000	7002000	who are becoming aware of this
7002000	7004000	and may have stumbled across
7004000	7006000	this podcast had it recommended
7006000	7008000	by a teacher by a friend
7008000	7010000	suddenly burst into this
7010000	7012000	awareness
7012000	7014000	of this world that was probably not centered
7014000	7016000	to their education and here they are
7016000	7018000	Do you use the word young humans or were you just mimicking me?
7018000	7020000	You use the word young humans
7020000	7022000	What do you say young people?
7022000	7024000	Young people but you know let's go with young humans
7024000	7026000	Okay
7028000	7030000	Young humans
7030000	7032000	keep learning
7032000	7034000	find
7034000	7036000	like-minded people to travel
7036000	7038000	like I just said
7038000	7040000	find
7040000	7042000	things that you're really interested
7042000	7044000	in and care about
7044000	7046000	learn skills
7046000	7048000	that would be useful
7048000	7050000	imagine the great simplification
7050000	7052000	happening
7052000	7054000	in your community
7054000	7056000	what would you want to be
7056000	7058000	involved in and responsible for
7058000	7060000	and partake in and start
7060000	7062000	thinking about that
7064000	7066000	The world will probably be
7066000	7068000	worse than many of us
7068000	7070000	expect but probably a lot
7070000	7072000	better than many of us fear
7072000	7074000	and don't let fear
7074000	7076000	dominate your life
7076000	7078000	I'm trying to
7078000	7080000	with this podcast
7080000	7082000	give a broad arc of
7082000	7084000	what's happening and
7084000	7086000	if you just happen upon a podcast
7086000	7088000	without knowing all the back
7088000	7090000	story leading up to it
7090000	7092000	it can be a little overwhelming
7092000	7094000	and my best advice for that is
7094000	7096000	listen to it or process it
7096000	7098000	with a group of other people
7098000	7100000	or a friend
7100000	7102000	and talk about it
7102000	7104000	talk about these things
7104000	7106000	get out in nature and get off your phone
7106000	7108000	as much as possible
7108000	7110000	those will be some of the pieces of advice
7110000	7112000	Nice
7112000	7114000	How can listeners reshape the way
7114000	7116000	they think
7116000	7118000	in order to best face the future
7118000	7120000	I don't think we can change
7120000	7122000	human behavior not on a dime
7122000	7124000	I think we can shift
7126000	7128000	we can create
7128000	7130000	we can use our cognitive skills
7130000	7132000	to
7132000	7134000	create speed bumps
7134000	7136000	in the future for the ghost
7136000	7138000	of dopamine past and our emotional
7138000	7140000	proclivities
7140000	7142000	I think we can change how we think
7142000	7144000	via
7144000	7146000	awareness
7146000	7148000	and meditation
7148000	7150000	and having a little Kate or a little Nate
7150000	7152000	on our shoulder chiming in
7152000	7154000	and observing and commenting
7154000	7156000	on what we're doing
7156000	7158000	and
7158000	7160000	try to find people that
7160000	7162000	disagree with you and steal man
7162000	7164000	their arguments and then
7164000	7166000	come back to
7166000	7168000	what you originally thought
7168000	7170000	and you might have a deeper appreciation
7170000	7172000	of the topic
7172000	7174000	and keep thinking in systems
7174000	7176000	on how things
7176000	7178000	fit together
7178000	7180000	but don't all only think
7180000	7182000	I mean thinking is part of the problem
7182000	7184000	that we're always just thinking
7184000	7186000	we have to also live
7186000	7188000	in the moment
7188000	7190000	We are now heading home woods
7190000	7192000	Are you ready?
7192000	7194000	What do you care about most?
7196000	7198000	What do you think I care about most?
7198000	7200000	What are you asking you?
7200000	7202000	I care about the natural world
7202000	7204000	and other species
7204000	7206000	that have no voice in our economic system
7206000	7208000	or on
7208000	7210000	the bend or break scenario
7210000	7212000	and
7212000	7214000	this
7214000	7216000	still is the only planet
7216000	7218000	that we are certain
7218000	7220000	has life and complex life
7220000	7222000	in the whole universe
7222000	7224000	and this
7224000	7226000	slowly unfolding
7226000	7228000	you know
7228000	7230000	metacrisis
7230000	7232000	has a large
7234000	7236000	back-ended cost
7236000	7238000	on the natural world
7238000	7240000	and I care mostly about that
7240000	7242000	I care about a lot of things which is
7242000	7244000	part of the cross
7244000	7246000	that I bear with this work
7246000	7248000	but I care about other species
7248000	7250000	insects, birds, mammals
7250000	7252000	trees, forests
7252000	7254000	at the end of the day
7254000	7256000	that's what I care about most
7256000	7258000	And especially dogs
7258000	7260000	Yeah
7260000	7262000	I care about dogs a lot
7262000	7264000	I've seen you with dogs, I've seen dogs passing in the street
7264000	7266000	and you just like
7266000	7268000	a whole other Nate comes out
7268000	7270000	everything else has swept away
7270000	7272000	there's a doggy on the pavement
7272000	7274000	we're going to put the dogs aside a moment
7274000	7276000	come back
7276000	7278000	what is one thing you worry about
7278000	7280000	for the next 10 years?
7280000	7282000	Well of course I would answer that
7282000	7284000	every day
7284000	7286000	but I think the thing that
7286000	7288000	worries me the most
7288000	7290000	is what I care about the most
7290000	7292000	is the natural world
7292000	7294000	and I think
7294000	7296000	we are approaching this
7296000	7298000	cultural awakening moment
7298000	7300000	of concern
7300000	7302000	for the biosphere and climate
7302000	7304000	and oceans and other species
7304000	7306000	and it's growing in the media
7306000	7308000	and I think that could be
7308000	7310000	upended by
7310000	7312000	energy scarcity, energy poverty
7312000	7314000	and economic problems
7314000	7316000	and a rightward shift politically around the world
7316000	7318000	and that all of this
7318000	7320000	burgeoning
7320000	7322000	environmental awareness
7322000	7324000	is going to go to the
7324000	7326000	back burner
7326000	7328000	in our cultural focus
7328000	7330000	and it will become more dangerous
7330000	7332000	to outwardly
7332000	7334000	talk about these things
7334000	7336000	relative to today
7336000	7338000	that's one of the things that I worry about
7338000	7340000	not only because
7340000	7342000	I have a podcast about nature
7342000	7344000	and systems but because
7344000	7346000	now is the time that that needs
7346000	7348000	to be prominent in our decisions
7348000	7350000	because ultimately
7350000	7352000	what's best for nature
7352000	7354000	and ecosystems is also
7354000	7356000	best for humans in the long run.
7356000	7358000	Indeed.
7358000	7360000	What is one thing you have hope
7360000	7362000	about over the next 10 years?
7362000	7364000	I have hope
7364000	7366000	in conversations like this
7366000	7368000	and I told you this in Sweden
7368000	7370000	is there are so many
7370000	7372000	pro-social
7372000	7374000	smart people
7374000	7376000	that are starting to get it
7376000	7378000	and starting to put things together
7378000	7380000	and starting to ask how do I change things
7380000	7382000	at my university, at my company
7382000	7384000	I've been giving presentations to
7384000	7386000	corporations
7386000	7388000	that want to understand
7388000	7390000	how this affects their business
7390000	7392000	so we have arrived at
7392000	7394000	how all these things fit together
7394000	7396000	and it's really politically
7396000	7398000	and socially difficult
7398000	7400000	to say these things out loud
7400000	7402000	but it's starting
7402000	7404000	and that gives me hope
7404000	7406000	is these conversations are becoming
7406000	7408000	less BS and
7408000	7410000	more
7410000	7412000	tethered to reality
7412000	7414000	that's a little scary but it's also hopeful
7414000	7416000	that we're going to have
7416000	7418000	an emergent response to some of these
7418000	7420000	events on the horizon.
7420000	7422000	If you could
7422000	7424000	wave a magic wand
7424000	7426000	with no personal recourse
7426000	7428000	to do one thing to improve the
7428000	7430000	future
7430000	7432000	what would you wave it at?
7434000	7436000	So the reason I
7436000	7438000	phrased that question that way
7438000	7440000	is waving a magic wand with no personal
7440000	7442000	recourse
7442000	7444000	is different than being a president
7444000	7446000	or a prime minister
7446000	7448000	because a president and a prime minister
7448000	7450000	could have a
7450000	7452000	dictum or a policy
7452000	7454000	but they're still beholden to their
7454000	7456000	constituents who voted them
7456000	7458000	and could vote them out.
7458000	7460000	A magic wand
7460000	7462000	presumably is do whatever
7462000	7464000	you want
7464000	7466000	and it doesn't matter what other people think.
7466000	7468000	You could go for dictator too but I quite like
7468000	7470000	the magic wand alternative.
7472000	7474000	I would
7474000	7476000	change
7476000	7478000	how people
7480000	7482000	change the lens
7482000	7484000	with which they view
7484000	7486000	their own lives and their existence to a
7486000	7488000	wider boundary one
7488000	7490000	and view that everything is connected
7490000	7492000	and that we're part of
7492000	7494000	this long
7494000	7496000	evolving
7496000	7498000	social biological
7498000	7500000	experiment that brought us
7500000	7502000	to this moment and to care
7502000	7504000	beyond
7504000	7506000	their own tiny sphere
7506000	7508000	into caring about other people
7508000	7510000	other generations and ecosystems
7510000	7512000	and I think a lot more things
7512000	7514000	would be possible if we expanded
7514000	7516000	the lens
7516000	7518000	of where we
7518000	7520000	measure our own boundaries of the self.
7522000	7524000	If you had, I'm going to give you six months
7524000	7526000	just
7526000	7528000	open up a little
7528000	7530000	window in the fabric of
7530000	7532000	time and you just get this
7532000	7534000	pocket of six months to dive
7534000	7536000	into one topic and explore it
7536000	7538000	however you want, what are you going to dive into?
7538000	7540000	The human brain
7540000	7542000	and how to
7544000	7546000	quiet down
7546000	7548000	the dopamine consumption
7548000	7550000	treadmill that we're on
7550000	7552000	and to heal
7552000	7554000	and come from a place of
7554000	7556000	equanimity
7556000	7558000	and view
7558000	7560000	the purpose of
7560000	7562000	one's life and one's work
7562000	7564000	towards the betterment of the future
7564000	7566000	rather than
7566000	7568000	individual
7568000	7570000	dopamine cascades
7570000	7572000	and social status
7572000	7574000	and monetary piles of digits
7574000	7576000	and
7576000	7578000	really what would that take
7578000	7580000	from a neuroscience
7580000	7582000	slash cultural
7582000	7584000	slash sociological perspective
7584000	7586000	to heal more humans
7586000	7588000	and
7588000	7590000	involve them in a
7590000	7592000	purpose for the greater good
7592000	7594000	given the challenges we face.
7594000	7596000	Is there any question I haven't asked you
7596000	7598000	that you're now thinking, oh, I really wish there was
7598000	7600000	this question in the podcast that she'd asked me
7600000	7602000	because I actually want to answer that.
7602000	7604000	No, this is
7604000	7606000	this has been great.
7608000	7610000	I'm going to carry on with this.
7610000	7612000	It feels
7612000	7614000	like it's
7614000	7616000	something that I was supposed to do
7618000	7620000	which is my kind of Midwest
7620000	7622000	you know
7622000	7624000	golden retriever
7624000	7626000	sort of personality interviewing
7626000	7628000	scientists and activists
7628000	7630000	on what we face
7630000	7632000	and then peppering in the franklies
7632000	7634000	to give kind of a
7634000	7636000	goofy color commentary on some
7636000	7638000	aspect.
7638000	7640000	I hope it continues
7640000	7642000	to scale and that
7642000	7644000	it's inspiring
7644000	7646000	others to have these
7646000	7648000	conversations at their dinner table
7648000	7650000	at their town meeting or at their
7650000	7652000	their companies
7652000	7654000	and
7654000	7656000	if it happens
7656000	7658000	and there's an episode 200
7658000	7660000	I may invite you back to
7660000	7662000	interview me again. Boy, what a world
7662000	7664000	will be at that point.
7664000	7666000	Fantastic, thank you very much
7666000	7668000	and again, of course, this is my show this week
7668000	7670000	so thank you very much, Nate
