0	8320	One of the main things in life is purpose, and most people born in the history of man
8320	13540	have not had particular purpose other than staying alive.
13540	20360	We have an opportunity to not just stay alive, earn a living, feed yourself, but we have
20360	28800	an opportunity to change the outcome for future generations stretching out for more or less
28800	31200	ever.
31200	35560	Today I'm pleased to welcome Jeremy Grantham to the great simplification.
35560	42760	Jeremy almost 50 years ago founded the investment firm GMO, where the G stands for Grantham,
42760	49960	and by societal metrics he is now a billionaire, though in this conversation he corrects me
49960	53040	on the definition of that.
53160	61280	An amazing mind, and I long ago followed him because in his GMO research notes back
61280	68680	when I oversaw the oil drum, he was writing about phosphorus and about oil and about
68680	75320	climate change and integrating lots of the same topics in the biophysical economics
75320	80160	field where I reside.
80160	87760	It's very encouraging to me to have such a financially successful person, almost fully
87760	94240	dedicated to environmental causes, particularly climate change, endocrine disrupting chemicals,
94240	104240	plastics, population, and I hope this conversation can act as an overton window or a siren song
104240	112320	to more people of means to look at the big picture of how energy, humans, and the environment
112320	114040	fit together.
114040	115920	There is no greater story.
115920	118600	Please welcome Jeremy Grantham.
118600	137520	I have so many questions for you because you are what I might refer to as everything
137520	142320	bagel as far as understanding the human predicament.
142320	148080	Not only are you an expert in finance and stock market and conventional investing, but
148080	155200	you also deeply care about the environment, including but not limited to climate change.
155200	156720	Let me start by asking you this.
156720	163560	We live in a culture that the last generation or so has rewarded reductionist experts like
163560	173400	real estate developers or physicists, and we don't really reward generalists who know
173400	179240	something about everything and how things fit together other than maybe librarians and,
179240	181720	in your case, hedge fund managers.
181720	187600	How did you begin your lifelong career interest and how everything fits together in multiple
187600	194680	subjects and when and why did you start to integrate specifically energy, ecology, and
194680	197800	the environment into your worldview?
197920	207120	There are people like us that when confronted with any situation, eventually get around
207120	215360	to saying, what are the bigger issues that circle around the outside of what we're doing
215360	217720	and how do they interrelate?
217720	225400	And then gradually your familiarity expands outwards and if you're curious enough, you
225400	232240	keep on going and whether you like it or not, you're thereby becoming a generalist
232240	238880	because you want to know what causes, what causes, what causes and you work your way,
238880	246080	in my case, quite slowly from the stock market, what drives the stock market, what drives
246080	252040	people, what are the big issues, what are the weaknesses of human beings, what are the
252040	259360	problems, therefore, that come out of our weaknesses and pretty soon you arrive at nature
259360	266080	and then you get into the whole thing about what we owe to nature, what it contributes
266080	277520	to our well-being, to a true benefit GDP, if you will, as opposed to the actual GDP,
277520	282920	which is a list of costs when you get down to it, not benefits.
282920	294200	And so onwards and upwards, aspects of nature, limitations, Kenneth Balding, the finiteness
294200	302040	of the world, spaceship earth, hurtling through space with only what it has.
302040	311280	There are no space stations to go and reload with fuel or torpedoes or anything, you've
311280	317240	only got what you've got and if you think about what rules and regulations you would
317240	324200	need for a multi-generational space trip in a rocket, it gives you some ideas of what
324200	333980	rules you really should have on planet earth and you keep on going until you end up with
333980	341000	my self-described job at work, which is underrated long-term problems.
341000	350680	And that has been a fabulously rewarding era for about 15 years because they are the things
350680	357600	that are really interesting, obviously they are the things that really matter and they
357600	365160	are bottomless pits, so you'll never know too much, you keep trying and you still only
365160	376400	know a tiny fraction of the problem and pretty soon you're on a podcast with you.
377400	384840	Well, since we both have financial backgrounds, let me follow with this question.
384840	393240	We don't have prices or incentives to solve most of those underrated long-term problems.
393240	400880	So I've had a lot of financial people that understand energy on this podcast and I know
400880	408800	a lot of them in my circles, but it seems that the more financially focused people are,
408800	414080	the less they're focused on the environment, not so much in your case.
414080	417440	How do you integrate what's going on there?
417440	423520	Because a lot of financial people are almost to the point of cognitive dissonance dismissing
423520	426400	climate change and other environmental risks.
426400	438800	I am absolutely shocked over the last 30 years at how little interest my fellow financial
438800	448600	types have throughout the industry in these issues on which our long-term well-being absolutely
448600	450680	depends.
450680	458640	It is cognitive dissonance and it's surprising because some of them are unbelievably smart
458640	463920	and yet missing whatever it is.
463920	474840	I don't know if it's wisdom or if it's peripheral vision being wider, but they're just not interested.
474840	481360	It is enough for them to become expert in fiddling and diddling with finance and making
481360	486080	a lot of money.
486080	492920	I think I have mentioned to you before that I got into finance for a very profound reason
492920	499360	and that was I asked which of my classmates from business school were having the most
499360	507840	fun and back then in 1968 by a very wide margin the guys in the stock market were having the
507840	515520	most fun and so I thought, well, I don't want to miss out on that and then I was amazed
515520	526240	that I was earning $12,000 in consulting and up from 10 in a year and they hired me into
526240	533600	the financial business in Boston at 18 and that was the going rate, just 50% higher.
533600	542560	50% higher I might add than they needed to pay me, I would have gone for 10, forget 12,
542560	551960	forget 18 and so that was very much a secondary discovery.
551960	555680	They were not only having more fun but they were getting paid a hell of a lot more money,
555920	556920	not to like about that.
556920	564360	Well, we're going to get into some of the deeper issues on the environment and endocrine
564360	575440	disrupting chemicals, climate change and other things but let me ask you this, energy underpins
575440	581080	the natural world and it underpins human systems and I think people are starting to understand
581080	587400	that a little more but finance is a layer on top of that because money is a claim on
587400	591600	energy and debt is a claim on future energy.
591600	604040	So if we're really going to change the extractive growth ecosystem, destructing human enterprise,
604120	612000	the people at the helm of finance need to be the ones to change, doesn't that have to
612000	613320	change somehow?
613320	622480	Yeah, we're not going to win what I call the race of our lives without huge government
622480	632520	backing and without the governments finding a way to encourage corporations to act more
632520	639960	responsibly and I think we may do that but we may not.
639960	643960	It's a hard call.
643960	647800	Yeah, so we'll get back to that.
647800	653800	I want to focus on climate, energy and the environment in this conversation but you were
653800	661520	on record recently in your main vocation regarding stock market levels saying that we
661520	665480	are in a super bubble.
665480	670800	I think most people are aware of you and your acumen in the financial sphere, not in the
670800	672720	environmental one.
672720	677240	What is a super bubble and why are we in one?
677240	686880	A super bubble is typically about two and a half sigma.
686880	691800	All bubbles in my opinion, we had to define them arbitrarily so we took the historical
691800	697480	data and we said every two sigma event which is in a random world every 44 years and the
697480	704400	stock market world every 35, close enough for government work, we would call that a bubble
704400	713240	and we went through every asset class in the database, took us months and in the end we
713240	716960	had a couple of hundred two sigma bubbles.
716960	725160	There was a handful of interesting paradigm shifts that didn't break such as the whole
725160	734200	Indian economy making a phase change from real peasant economy to a more complicated
734200	739960	industrial economy, exactly the kind of exceptions you might think.
739960	750320	So oil appeared to go through a paradigm shift back in the first opaque shock and never
750320	759200	regrouped from that level whereas the rest of commodities continued down for the 20th
759200	761120	century.
761120	766800	Oil you could say really was flat slightly up and that was the great exception and a
766800	769480	very important exception.
769480	776360	And again very plausible, you might think that oil would show the first signs of beginning
776360	781200	to run out before other things and I believe it did.
781200	786560	But I saw a podcast with you a few months ago that you say we're in a super bubble now
786560	791600	in the stock market and that's more based on your conventional analysis.
791600	802560	Okay, no everything is critical to what is a bubble, a two sigma and they in the developed
802560	812680	world they all went back to the previous trend prior to the bubble starting and a classic
812680	821400	bubble is two or three years up, two or three years down and in the stock market they've
821400	823240	been very well behaved.
823240	829920	A super bubble is kind of much more interesting because that has penetrated through the two
829920	837560	sigma territory of a badly overpriced market and continues up.
837560	841000	It also has a second criteria.
841000	852120	It has to have really crazy speculation increase in all sorts of financial activity, people
852120	858640	have to start thinking that it will go on forever, that it's a new paradigm, that they
858640	865080	only worry about missing out, they buy stocks because they're going up not because of anything
865080	867120	to do with the fundamentals.
867160	874560	The classic being the meme stocks, probably one of the greatest examples in modern times
874560	879680	of 2020 and 2021.
879680	891280	And there aren't many of these, 1929 was a humdinger, 1972, 74 the nifty 50 was an honorary
891280	895560	member right on the cusp that you could put it either way.
895560	904200	2000 was another humdinger, bigger and better than 1929, full of absolutely crazy behavior.
904200	910720	The housing bubble was very much a housing bubble, crazy behavior, a three sigma event,
910720	919680	a bigger remarkable breakout of housing prices even the 1929 and 2000 in stock prices.
919680	930560	And then once again in 2021, we had a two and a half sigma and an utterly crazy behavior.
930560	938480	I believe if you look at the scale of it, the biggest, most significant crazy behavior
938480	944160	in recorded history of the US stock market.
944680	952280	When you look at those, they go back to trend like all the other normal ones, but they cause
952280	957880	a whole lot more pain because they distort the system on the way up, there is a huge
957880	960720	income effect and wealth effect.
960720	966080	And when they inevitably break, they're always a shock because everyone has locked into the
966080	968880	new paradigm.
969440	975800	They nearly always take longer than people think because they're so powerful and they
975800	981840	didn't get there by accident, they were driven by some underlying important fundamentals.
981840	988960	So there was lots to believe in, but they eventually come down to trend and all but
988960	992880	one of them in history go below trend for a while.
992880	1000160	And that creates an enormous negative income effect and has always caused a recession.
1000160	1007240	If you miscalculate, the recession turns into something really terrible like the depression
1007240	1017160	of 1929, like the bitter recession of the nifty 50, 72, 74 of the near total financial
1017160	1022240	collapse of the housing bust in 08.
1022240	1026720	And one should expect something pretty bad this time.
1026720	1034360	And we await to see if this follows the pattern of history or whether it is indeed that lovely
1034360	1037160	creature and new paradigm.
1037160	1041760	But history is not kind to the new paradigm thinking.
1041760	1045200	So let me ask you a couple of follow ups to that.
1045240	1052280	Your analysis of these super bubbles is based on the concept of mean reversion that we revert
1052280	1053280	to the trend.
1053280	1062600	But the trend of the last century has been one of rising energy access globally.
1062600	1066840	We're now at a 19 terawatt global metabolism.
1066840	1073240	And so your analysis suggests that we're going to mean revert to the trend.
1073280	1082240	But on top of that analysis, there's also peak cheap oil, geopolitical competition for
1082240	1089840	a finite pie, and growing ecosystem disruptions.
1089840	1097320	So I think the entire trend line might start to flatten or decline.
1097320	1099360	What are your thoughts on that?
1099360	1108480	Well, regrettably, you may very well be right, our last couple of papers began to spell out
1108480	1115280	what we thought the fundamental problems were that could get worse.
1115280	1123920	And I conclude that they are worse and more potentially dangerous than the collection
1123920	1132280	of fundamental surrounding all the other super bubbles, including 1929.
1132280	1135040	We were really ham-fisted in 1929.
1135040	1143920	We persevered in some terrible international trade wars, which was unnecessary and destructive.
1143920	1146240	And maybe we will be very clever this time.
1146240	1149360	Maybe we will be stupid once again.
1149360	1150720	Who knows?
1150720	1157400	But there is a very dangerous set, which you were beginning to describe, but with Russia
1157400	1166200	and China, Ukraine, and the resource impact of Ukraine, Russia, and so on.
1166200	1173560	And with the breaking down of the world in which international trade increased to one
1173560	1179800	in which international trade may very well slowly decrease, going from an increasing
1179800	1183440	efficiency to an increasing inefficiency.
1183440	1192280	And with the population profile shifting fairly violently by any population standard,
1192280	1199000	we have never seen a shift of this magnitude, going from rapid growth to rapid decline
1199000	1201520	in a 30-year window.
1201520	1208640	And as recently as the early 1990s, you couldn't find people talking about a population slowing
1208640	1209640	down.
1209640	1211320	They were going along.
1211320	1214760	And now the baby cohorts are in free fall.
1214760	1217240	They are dropping rapidly.
1217240	1225400	And people don't realize that the global cohort of babies is below 98 now, 1998, though we
1225400	1229840	peaked in about 0506 and we've been declining every year.
1229840	1234560	Even though African baby cohorts are still going up, on a global basis, the total is
1234560	1236320	going down.
1236320	1242680	And in the developed world in China, we are having, in most countries, fewer 20-year-olds
1242680	1250000	entering the workforce, and that is completely unique and could have very bad consequences.
1250000	1252360	And then we have the resource component.
1252360	1257240	I think my colleague and I are scooped.
1257240	1263240	We've only had one scoop, and that was 2011, we wrote a paper, Time to Wake Up, The Age
1263240	1270920	of Plentiful and Cheap Resources is Gone Forever, in which we made the case that, of
1270920	1274760	course, in a finite world, you would eventually expect that to happen.
1274760	1280560	And there were now finally signs that it was happening, but the final push over the edge
1280560	1292880	had been the amazing and accelerating growth in China's demand for important resources.
1292880	1296640	For the last four years, they accelerated to double digit.
1296640	1304920	They were increasing at over 10% a year in their demand for cement, iron ore, coal, and
1304920	1309000	one or two other things, but not oil.
1309000	1317080	So you have earned deep respect in the financial community for your long-term success as an
1317080	1318080	investor.
1318080	1326920	I think I suspect many of your peers still look at money and technology as the driver
1326920	1336320	of the human experience and may look at your views on commodities and energy and the environment
1336320	1340240	as somewhat Malthusian.
1340240	1342000	What are your thoughts there?
1342640	1348400	My thoughts are that Malthus and what he said is a nice complicated topic that we could
1348400	1357840	discuss for a minute or two, that for a year or two after our paper in 2011, as we hit
1357840	1366080	the temporary cyclical setback caused by China slowing and global grain weather improving,
1366080	1370720	some thought we were entertainingly wrong.
1370720	1376320	And it took a few years before the long-term trend line to clearly be different.
1376320	1383840	The long-term trend line for, we keep a very interesting index at GMO, 33 important equal-weighted
1383840	1385000	commodities.
1385000	1390040	To study the question, what is happening to commodities, not what is happening to oil
1390040	1392000	and iron ore?
1392000	1398000	And those 33 declined by 70% in the 20th century.
1398000	1404400	And yes, there were three spikes, World War I, World War II and OPEC, of course.
1404400	1409120	But in between, they dropped back to the trend line, which was declining at just over 1%
1409120	1412880	a year, which accumulates pretty damn fast over 100 years.
1412880	1419320	So a drop in the average price of important commodities of 70%, enormous help in getting
1419320	1420800	rich.
1420800	1424560	And then in 2002, it shifted.
1424560	1430960	And the index that had gone from 100 to 30 is back over 90.
1430960	1434160	It has tripled since 2022.
1434160	1439000	This is not the trend that we all grew up on.
1439000	1446080	This is a new world in which we are going to have to come to terms with the finiteness
1446080	1447720	of almost everything.
1447720	1454000	I think for reasonable purposes, there's enough aluminum and iron ore to get the job
1454000	1457040	done.
1457040	1463720	But everything else, most of the metals we think of on the same level with iron ore
1463720	1472240	are 100 or more often a thousandth as frequent in the Earth's crust as aluminum and iron.
1472240	1481240	And I think aluminum is about 7.5%, 8% of the crust, iron ore is 4.5%.
1481240	1487600	And copper, cobalt, lithium, nickel that we use for batteries and so on, they range
1487600	1494200	from 0.002 to 0.006.
1494200	1495200	That's the range.
1495200	1501760	And you can take 30 of those important chemicals like nickel and copper.
1501760	1506640	And add them all together and they aren't 1%.
1506640	1512720	They aren't a tiny fraction of iron ore or aluminum.
1512720	1515240	And nobody really gets that.
1515240	1517760	And there are no reserves anymore.
1517760	1525120	China pretty well bled the last great minds of these important but actually rare metals.
1525480	1533480	Well, in a convoluted way, the 70% drop in that commodity basket in the 20th century
1533480	1543120	was due to an expansion of fossil armies of hydrocarbons that did the work for us and
1543120	1549200	all those extraction industries, the rise of the machines.
1549200	1554800	So we had more access to oil and that oil and the machines that it powered gave us more
1554800	1559520	access to get the overburden from the mines for copper and nickel and all the things you
1559520	1561120	were mentioning.
1561120	1567280	But you said that that change in 2002, I think 1999 was the all time inflation adjusted low
1567280	1572800	for oil and we've been going up since and the extraction costs for oil have tripled
1572800	1576400	since around that time.
1576400	1578400	So we are in a new paradigm.
1578400	1584240	There's just maybe a two decade lag before people start to notice it and puzzle it out.
1584240	1585480	I agree.
1585480	1591640	So do people in your sphere, when you go to hedge fund conferences or whatever those are
1591640	1601200	nowadays, do they start to see the world through an energy lens or is that not yet happening?
1601200	1602680	First of all, I don't do that.
1602680	1610080	I spend more time mixing with people like you and going to green gatherings and green
1610080	1618880	tech gatherings and I haven't been to a hedge fund gathering for 15 years.
1618880	1625240	But I can pretty well answer for them and most of them with a few interesting exceptions
1625240	1628840	do not get it at all.
1628840	1633840	And it's a pretty good reason and that's because the economic establishment has never
1633840	1636040	gotten it.
1636040	1638360	The classical economists had their feet on the ground.
1638360	1643120	They understood they lived in a real world and Keynes did.
1643120	1654640	But the establishment since then basically wasted in this efficient market rational expectation
1654640	1656800	nonsense.
1656800	1665200	Building models to be neat and mathematical and show their physics envy, but totally
1665200	1666200	useless.
1666200	1672040	They completely lost the plot as Kenneth Boling who started out as a typical mainstream economist
1672040	1677920	and then kind of resigned when he was about 50 because he found economics totally useless
1677920	1683040	as in the direction it was heading and in my opinion, totally right.
1683040	1691960	So everything you read from the mainstream economics ignores the role of energy and resources.
1691960	1698480	You make a loaf of bread with capital and labor with the oven and with the worker with the
1698480	1702440	great paddle to stick it in the oven.
1702440	1708320	You do not apparently need any wheat and you don't apparently need any heat.
1708320	1712400	It is absolutely a laughable state of affairs.
1712400	1717800	But when you throw in these more difficult things, your equations become too complicated
1717800	1719960	and start to break down.
1719960	1725520	And when you leave them all out and you assume everything away and you assume perfect knowledge
1725520	1730760	and perfect information flow and in the stock market equal knowledge on the side of the
1730760	1737680	buyers and the sellers and all these ludicrous assumptions as if it isn't a kind of wilderness
1738160	1742120	of psychology, the stock market.
1742120	1750000	You get nonsense out of the end of their equations and big corporations and finance pick up on
1750000	1751400	that.
1751400	1754020	It impregnates their business.
1754020	1766520	So the financial equivalent of wasted 70 years of economics is the efficient market hypothesis
1766520	1772680	which ran the university finance system for 50 years.
1772680	1779200	Again, a total waste of, worse than a waste, it was damaging, punishing and sending the
1779200	1781120	world in the wrong direction.
1781120	1787920	Eugene Fama and Ken French were my honors advisors at the University of Chicago and
1787920	1792360	in the entire two years I was there, the word energy was never mentioned.
1792360	1798440	Well, you demonstrated commendable restraint by standing your ground.
1798440	1803640	That is a sneaky way of saying if you'd known what you were doing, you would have left and
1803640	1805440	gone somewhere more sensible.
1805440	1810200	I did that three years later after I started to figure it out.
1810200	1815880	I was a high net worth salesman at Salomon Brothers and one of my clients eventually
1815880	1821800	started to trade oil futures and I was learning about that and I was learning about how amazingly
1821800	1828840	powerful this stuff is, how we don't pay for the cost of the externalities, the pollution
1828840	1831640	and how it's going to peak and decline in my lifetime.
1831640	1837000	So soon after that I quit and studied with Herman Daly and others.
1837000	1838200	So that's how that happened.
1838200	1840320	That was over 20 years ago, Jeremy.
1840320	1841320	Yeah.
1841320	1849880	No, it's surprising that you could have something so valuable as oil and metals and have them
1849960	1854600	cost nothing except the cost of digging it out of the ground.
1854600	1862040	And that is right there the fundamental flaw in economic theory and in our governance and
1862040	1867400	expectations of our current system is we're only paying for the cost of extraction.
1867400	1876920	And the sad part is looking back, all this magical pixie dust from that earth trickle
1876920	1882680	charged from prior photosynthesis has been wasted, especially in the West.
1882680	1889240	We don't really have anything to show for it, anything of long-term value.
1890680	1897400	So piggybacking on something you said earlier that we were ham-fisted in our response to the
1897400	1904920	Great Depression in 1929 and you hope that people could be more clever as opposed to
1904920	1907640	not clever this time around.
1907640	1916760	So with an energy lens and an ecological lens, how could we be more clever this time around
1917640	1918280	in theory?
1919240	1920440	That is pretty simple.
1921240	1922440	You need a carbon tax.
1924120	1925640	Now pigs will fly.
1926360	1927480	No, that's not true.
1927480	1932280	Eventually we'll all have carbon tax because we'll get desperate and everybody knows
1932840	1938600	even the idiot economists get this right, that a carbon tax is far and away the most
1938600	1941880	effective way of dealing with climate change.
1943080	1950040	And you can bribe people into doing the right thing through subsidies, but it's very inefficient
1950040	1955320	and expensive in contrast and it's just politically easier.
1956280	1962440	So a carbon tax would be the first enormous step in the right direction.
1963400	1964760	For two reasons.
1964760	1970680	One is going to be politically unacceptable at the moment, which is half the people don't
1970680	1979560	believe that climate and ocean absorption of our emissions is critical and urgent and human
1979560	1980520	cost.
1980520	1983240	So it will be politically difficult for that reason.
1983240	1987880	But the other reason to have a carbon tax is to make this incredibly...
1987880	1988840	I have to interrupt.
1989400	1995400	Half of Americans, it is nothing like a half around the rest of the developed world.
1995400	1996680	Good point, good point.
1998600	2005880	Yeah, I read recently that if you know nothing at all and you just ask someone what their
2005880	2012280	belief is on climate change, that the single biggest predictor of people's opinion on climate
2012280	2016520	change is their political affiliation, which really tells you something.
2017640	2018520	It's quite amazing.
2021240	2025960	It tells you that we get information from different sources, among other things.
2027480	2029480	Thank you for the clarification.
2029480	2034120	Here's the other reason that a carbon tax would be helpful longer term.
2035080	2042760	From the perspective of we're wasting this incredibly valuable substance, if there were a
2042760	2049560	carbon tax, the prices would be more commensurate with its true cost and value.
2051560	2056760	And so we would conserve, we would send the right signals to innovators and investors like
2057240	2066600	yourself that this phone here might cost $3,000 because it's got a lot of non-renewable inputs
2066600	2072760	in it, so there would be repair and different industries would crop up around that.
2074360	2080920	But the challenge with such a carbon tax is we are in financial overshoot, not to mention
2080920	2088440	ecological overshoot. So any realistic carbon tax today would prick the financial bubble
2088440	2091160	even worse than the mean reversion you expect.
2092040	2098760	Yeah, I think we shouldn't overlook the benefits of a carbon tax to government income.
2102280	2108120	It would not only be a great source of income, but it would be taxing something you want people
2108120	2116520	to use less of like tobacco instead of taxing labor that you want people to use more of.
2117320	2124120	And it would be a much better way of raising money, but you would have to make sure that you
2124120	2133320	reduced income tax on particularly the fore end of the spectrum to compensate for the tax on
2134280	2142040	energy. But the rich people use 50 times more energy than the poor people around the world
2142840	2150520	and maybe even within the country 10 or 20 times. As we get more desperate, sooner or later a
2153080	2158680	political regime will find its way to do something that is effectively
2159000	2168280	a tax on carbon. There is an 800 pound gorilla lurking around here that you're not aware of.
2168840	2178840	And that is, I don't agree with only one part, one little slice of your argument as reflected
2179720	2191240	so well in your 95-96 podcast. And that is the role of debt and finance in general.
2191800	2202280	The good news is if you take all the people in this game of overshoot, living beyond our means
2202280	2209480	is how I think of it. And you look at how much they obsess about finance and have done
2210360	2216280	forever for 30, 40 years. And you go back and you take it all out of everything they ever said
2216280	2224120	or ever wrote. It doesn't make any difference at all. It has not changed anything that they,
2224120	2231560	in my opinion, have gotten it wrong. And it probably will continue not to change anything.
2231560	2237880	So as long as they are generally heading in the right direction, everything will work out fine.
2238520	2248600	But I think debt is the most misunderstood thing of all. And the reason is pretty clear.
2249640	2256360	At the individual level, when you're making a list of what you're worth, you add up your assets
2256360	2261960	and you subtract your debt. It is a negative. At the societal level,
2264040	2271960	debt is not like gold. Debt is not like copper or like stock market, a claim on real corporations
2271960	2279640	with real workers and real output. Debt is a zero entry. Debt is double entry bookkeeping.
2280200	2287560	We might as well say, aren't the Japanese incredibly rich that they can lend so much money?
2287560	2292920	But we don't say that. We say, look at the incredible Japanese debt. My God, they will collapse,
2292920	2300920	as we have been saying for 40, 50 years, waiting for them to collapse unsuccessfully. I might add.
2301880	2311320	Debt is shockingly misunderstood and exaggerated in significance. You cannot move resources through
2311320	2318520	time, other than a few cans of bully beef in your basement, or at least make sure that the
2318520	2325320	infrastructure is set up in good shape for your children. Other than that, you cannot move assets,
2325320	2332280	you cannot move income. The Germans at least understood this with their social security.
2332280	2338760	They know that it is a pay as you go. They don't pretend, as we used to, about lock boxes and
2338760	2347240	social security going bust or accumulating. You only have the sum of your goods and services
2347240	2354760	each year to pay your pensions. And if that goes down, you will have less either to pay the pensions
2354760	2361960	or less for everybody else. It is not about debt claiming on the future. Debt does not claim on the
2361960	2369880	future. What debt does is I give you my money today that I could spend and I lend it to you.
2369880	2375800	That is not a claim on the future. It does not transfer income through time, but it scrambles
2375800	2381960	everybody's thinking. And luckily, in this field of overshoot, it doesn't make a damn bit of difference.
2382040	2388200	Well, you're a billionaire and I'm just a podcaster with a few rows of potatoes and a draft
2388200	2395400	horse, but I am going to push back on that a little bit. Yes, you're right that so far it
2395400	2401080	has not made a difference because so far we have lived in a world of rising energy access
2402360	2410120	every year, with the exception of a couple of recessions. Yes, you're right that in a financial
2410120	2416120	lens, it's a zero sum game. There are assets and liabilities. So from that perspective,
2416840	2423640	it is a Pareto problem where the wealth gets more and more concentrated
2424280	2431800	and the creditors end up having a larger share of that pie. But from a biophysical perspective,
2432440	2438360	every time we create money via commercial banks or recently via central banks,
2439800	2446600	there's the same amount of oil and forests and copper and dolphins. And so what ends up happening
2446600	2452280	right now, the United States has increased our debt $1 trillion in the last three months.
2452280	2457560	I mean, it's like almost a billion dollars an hour. Yes, that's allowing us to consume more today
2457560	2463400	and it's papering over other problems and it's one of the reasons stock market and Bitcoin and
2463400	2470600	other things are up. But eventually, when all this money has to be called in to be spent,
2471720	2477320	that especially if we're on the downslope of oil and instead of 100 million barrels a day,
2477320	2484760	we have 90 or 80 or 70, it's a musical chair sort of situation. So I agree with you that so far
2484760	2491320	debt has not been a problem. But I think what it's done is it's an example of risk homeostasis
2491320	2496040	that we've run a red light 10 times and nothing bad ever happened. That doesn't mean that running
2496040	2506760	a red light isn't dangerous. I understand you have to protect your opinions. No, no, no, I want to
2506760	2512200	learn. If you disagree, please educate me. I was counting on you saying that.
2515880	2521320	Happily, I don't think it matters. So I don't want us to spend any more time because I have an
2521320	2529800	eccentric view and plenty of people would think you're right. They share your view. Just one point
2529880	2540920	though. I am only a billionaire by a strange and generous construction. And that is if you count
2540920	2549480	the money I have given away, which is a pretty whimsical way of calculating someone's net worth.
2549480	2556600	But in terms of what I actually have and could go out and buy my daughter back from being kidnapped
2556600	2567640	tomorrow, I don't have a... I'm at least an order of magnitude short of that.
2567640	2573640	Well, I actually think that is a wonderful way to define being a billionaire in the future,
2573640	2579320	isn't it, going forward? That you count how much money you have given away towards pro-social,
2579400	2583960	pro-future ends. I mean, that's a better definition, wouldn't you say?
2584840	2595720	It would be conducive to better behavior, maybe. But it is important at least to get that out there.
2597480	2604120	And most of what we have left, we see as a potential reserve for a rainy day.
2605080	2611560	And incidentally, we have a rainy day in our foundation. Our foundation is about 1.4
2613000	2621240	billion. And we have invested perhaps an unwisely large piece in venture capital,
2621960	2628200	a large chunk of which is green venture capital. And the reason for that is we think that green
2628200	2634840	venture capital, if you only invest in things that seem really important, and you concentrate on
2634840	2643080	those that have a hard time raising the money, you'll end up with a risky portfolio, but on paper
2643080	2651640	should give you, in a hundred deals, a very high return. And traditionally, it has. But every 15
2651640	2662600	or 20 years, it participates in these, excuse me, in these bubbles. And so we get hammered and we
2662600	2670200	become illiquid, and the companies call for the money that we've committed, and they stop funding
2670200	2680360	it back, which we really count on. And that causes a liquidity squeeze. So times are tricky.
2680360	2688280	I will say this, though, that I think a diversified package of important green venture capital
2689480	2698760	drives the cause better than anything. Very hard for a dollar of grant to keep up with a dollar
2698760	2703960	of green venture capital, because the green venture capital on average comes back with 15%
2703960	2711720	profit and then goes out again, and out again, and out again. So those dollars can be really,
2712440	2719240	in the long run, very, very effective. So what are some projects you're particularly excited
2719240	2727160	about in the green venture capital area of your work? Well, if you started at the top end, what
2727160	2736200	could be a get out of jail card from a conundrum or a potential get out of jail card, you would have
2738120	2749000	infinite, cheap green energy, right? So that would be a huge help. And when solar and storage
2750360	2756920	might make it, but we'd probably need an order of magnitude improvement in storage costs,
2756920	2765480	a drop to 10 cents on the dollar. And we'll probably get it. It might take 10 or 20 years.
2766600	2779960	And it might take, who knows, longer, shorter. But the other ones are geothermal. I am very optimistic
2780840	2787400	that if we could take our incredible ingenuity and the experience and the trial and error from
2787400	2795160	having drilled 200,000 racking wells, learning on the job, if we could take some of that
2795160	2802280	skill set and move it to geothermal, there is a virtually infinite supply of energy
2803320	2809240	under our feet. If we could learn through ingenious ways of drilling to handle the
2809240	2816120	temperature, to frack it, to pick up the heat, turn it into either
2819800	2826840	into electricity or even just into heat and do it here and there all over the planet,
2826840	2836280	that would be huge. And next, an even more of a long shot is naturally occurring hydrogen.
2836920	2844040	Hydrogen is obviously going to be incredibly useful, but getting it is energy intensive,
2844040	2849960	so that really, in the current state of affairs, it's more like a battery than a source of energy.
2849960	2858280	But naturally occurring hydrogen, of course, is a source of energy. And we don't know. In 10 years,
2858280	2866200	it will probably be a done deal. We'll know that it's not a workable, impressive component.
2867240	2874840	But it may be. And so that's pretty thrilling. And then we have fusion. There are maybe now 40
2876200	2882680	diverse efforts, different efforts, and it's the difference that makes it interesting. I think
2883480	2890040	one or two of them may well make it from an engineering technology point of view
2891000	2899480	in a few decades. And that is, again, an infinite source of energy. What I worry about,
2900840	2905560	we have a few investments, what I worry about for them is that by the time they make it,
2906360	2912600	it may turn out that wind, solar, and storage has made so much steady progress,
2912600	2917880	or that geothermal and naturally occurring hydrogen has, that they will not be necessary,
2917880	2925240	that the capital cost will be too high to compete. But it may be fine. And we have to do it. We need
2925240	2932920	to try everything. So I have a lot of follow-ups to that. If you were just an investor, I might leave
2932920	2941880	it at what you just said. But I know you also are aware of the work of Patrick Ofles and ecologist
2941880	2949080	William Reese, who are both on my podcast, Friends of Mine. And technology itself is necessary,
2949720	2955080	but not sufficient to solve some of the larger issues. And climate change,
2955720	2961160	from an ecological perspective, isn't the problem. It's a symptom of a much larger problem, which
2961160	2969960	is overshoot. So in addition to technological green investments, we're also going to need
2969960	2976200	something on the cultural and political side. Otherwise, the productivity from these new
2976840	2984840	improvements that you're advocating and hoping for will just be fed back into a global energy
2984840	2989720	and resource consumptive system, if GDP is our goal. What are your thoughts about that?
2990040	2998200	So nearly infinite cheap green energy is a very helpful but not sufficient condition.
3000120	3010840	I do not think there is any hope of creating a degrowth culture profound enough or quickly enough
3010840	3021400	to save our bacon. I do think we can tip it slowly on the margin in that direction. What I think
3023480	3033560	may save the day is population. Population, particularly in the high resource areas,
3034280	3043240	is dropping rapidly. And by population standards, it's nose diving. And nobody really appreciates
3043240	3050200	the speed at which it's dropping. To take the extreme case, the career has a fertility rate,
3050760	3058920	South Korea, of 0.8 last year, and not much higher the five years before that. At 0.8,
3058920	3066840	it means in three generations, 100 years, your baby cohort will be 6.5% of what it is today.
3066840	3074680	Basically, you're out of business. And if I am right in what I see as the reasons for this,
3074680	3082600	it is highly likely that the population of high energy, high resource using rich countries
3082600	3098920	and China, will be substantially lower in, let us say, by 2200. I think we could drift down
3099960	3107160	to about 2 billion people, which we could sustain. And it's only that piece of incredible,
3107160	3112680	you could say good luck. If we can hold the system together under the stress of going to 2
3112680	3122200	billion people, combined with nudging us towards a degrowth philosophy and understanding that we
3122200	3129160	have to restructure ourselves to live within our limits, that gives us a decent chance of making
3129160	3135080	it. And to have cheap green energy would make a big improvement in the odds.
3135080	3141880	So let me clarify something. So the global population is still increasing. The global
3141880	3149640	population growth rate, I think, peaked in 1965 and has been declining ever since then.
3149640	3157800	But we are still, net births over deaths is around plus 80 million humans per year.
3158760	3164680	And that's declining. But it's still growing, the total population. So
3165720	3172520	are you saying, because Elon Musk has a much different perspective, he thinks global population
3172520	3180520	decline is the biggest risk that humans face. So population is, do we have too many people or
3180520	3188840	not enough? And how do you marry those two views? I'm only interested in births,
3188840	3199320	because in the end, accumulating retirees doesn't really matter. The long-term well-being of the
3199320	3207960	species depends on young people. Except there are some people in your sphere that are advocating
3207960	3213480	for longevity and that we're going to, with AI and other things, we're going to live to be 120
3213480	3218600	or 130, which would also have an ecological impact if that comes to pass.
3219640	3227400	For 60, 70 years, I mean, the fact is, they die off. The dynamics that matter are the dynamics
3227400	3233960	of young people and how many children they have. You can have an army of old people.
3234920	3243400	And that long-term significance is negligible. Once you know the flight path of babies,
3244040	3248040	you know the flight path of 20-year-olds, you know the flight path of the economy.
3248680	3259000	Yes, there is a risk that dropping at this speed will stress out the economy. And we will,
3259560	3266440	in 20 years, think that we're poor and that we can't afford to do the necessary things
3266440	3276360	on the environment to protect our existence. That would be very sad. On the other hand,
3276360	3285880	if AI is half as good as some people believe, it will mesh very well with a rapid decline
3285960	3292280	in workforce. And we will have a rapid decline in workforce. I rather hope there is
3293400	3302280	a brilliant development in AI so they can look after the old folk and so on. And life will go on
3303320	3310600	holding together. That's the big trick. Can we hold together to 2200 to arrive in a world
3310600	3320440	where there are 2 billion people, including the old fogies, and where we could be a world where
3320440	3327560	at least half of the land is rewilded and we're living eventually within our means?
3328680	3333480	And it may not be 2 billion, it may be 1 billion, it may be 2.5, but it's going to be something like
3333480	3343080	that. I know that the advocates of AI who are aware and concerned about climate change do think
3343080	3349800	that AI can solve climate change. And for the same reason I mentioned before, Jevons Paradox,
3350360	3356360	artificial intelligence can make things more efficient and do demand side management for
3356360	3365880	our energy use and all those things. But it can't do at least not AI, maybe AGI, it can't do wisdom.
3365880	3372760	So it's not going to change our cultural objective or cultural aspirations. And I actually think the
3372760	3380120	declining labor force, which you're talking about, is from smaller baby cohorts. AI is going to do that
3380120	3385080	because it's going to take people's jobs away. And so I think there's a real wealth and income
3385080	3391400	inequality risk with AI that gets thrown into this picture as well. Do you have any thoughts there?
3392040	3401240	Yes, I'm on this topic rather pleased with myself because 15 years ago I wrote a little
3401240	3411880	piece about the country club on the beach being served by androids. And the
3414440	3425800	last human supervisor slash helpers has just been talked about in a message that
3425800	3434280	one of the androids has sent to his fellows that Fred, a nice guy as he is, is really starting
3434280	3443240	to get in the way. And after that point, there is no productivity per man hour. There is only
3443240	3452760	productivity per robot hour, or if you will, return on capital. And the capital owners sit in the
3452760	3462120	country club. And around the perimeter, one might think barbed wire, there are hordes of
3463560	3469880	other humans who have no job and are therefore totally useless and worthless, etc., etc.,
3470600	3478840	hoping for some handouts from the country club. And the real job of government in AI
3479560	3489480	is an income dispersion job. Let us imagine that world in 300 years when we've been really lucky
3489480	3495880	and have survived all these other existential threats. And the robots are doing all the work.
3498440	3504840	Do the capital owners get everything? Do the rest just disappear and starve? Or long before that,
3504840	3513240	do they revolt and get put down by the robots or vice versa? And so on. But an enlightened government
3513240	3520120	will move to head that stuff off pretty quickly by making sure that there is a fairly broad,
3520120	3526680	acceptable income distribution. And we are already falling foul of that. Our income distribution
3527480	3535080	in the US is no longer passing that test. It has resulted in the estrangement,
3535640	3544680	almost bitterness and anger of at least a third of the general public who feels they have been
3544680	3550760	badly treated. And I think you could make a pretty good case that, yes, they have been royally screwed
3550840	3556760	since about 1975. That's why I'm less sanguine on some of these electric car
3558200	3563800	forecasts and things like that. Because as of now, as the sugar high from the COVID stimulus
3563800	3571240	is waning, I think I saw a stat last week that 50% of Americans cannot afford a car payment
3571240	3578120	at today's rates with higher interest rates built in. So, you know, we're one of the richest
3578120	3582520	nations in the world, but the wealth is certainly not evenly distributed.
3583560	3590840	Right. And if you think of car payment, much more important really is house payment. And
3592680	3601320	buying a house, it's such a high unaffordability index now. Peak prices as a multiple of family
3601320	3611080	income times 7.8% mortgage. You're sitting there down in Washington with a mortgage of 2.7 real
3611080	3620760	story. It's pretty hard to move to Boston at 7.8 or 7.9. That is a brutal increase in your cost.
3620760	3632040	So, cars, houses, and real life, this is not a super comfortable world for everyone below half
3632840	3640840	way on the income scale. And it's not that great in the last 30 years from the 50th percentile
3640840	3652440	till about the 20th. It's been great for the 0.1. So, most people think that all capitalism
3652440	3658040	is the same thing, but you frequently pointed out that American capitalism is unique.
3660200	3665880	What do you mean by this? And what are the alternatives? And ultimately, I want to get to,
3665880	3673240	is there a different way that we can allocate capital, our scarce capital, which is energy,
3673240	3678040	resources, and our impact on ecosystems going forward? What are your thoughts on that?
3678680	3688680	We have fallen in many ways on bad times from about 1975. From about 1930 to 75,
3689000	3697560	everybody got richer at about the same rate. There was a very slight tendency for the poorer
3697560	3709560	to outgrow the richer. And so, by about 1965 to 75, we reached, by American standards anyway,
3709880	3725240	a rather egalitarian level. And people frequently quote the 4,500 CEOs earning 40 times, which
3725240	3733800	turns out to be about what the Japanese CEOs were earning too. And now, 50 years later, the Japanese
3733800	3744520	CEOs earn 40 or 50 times their worker, average worker. And we yield about 250 to 400 depending
3744520	3752360	on who's doing the calculating. But it is, you have to say obscene. It's unnecessary too.
3752920	3760360	Most of these people are very average qualities. The people who start their own darn firm,
3761240	3772440	like Mr. Musk. And in a sense, they deserve what they get. People who start a new enterprise,
3773640	3777720	when you've paid all the rent and you've paid all the salaries, what's left is yours.
3777720	3783000	I get that. That's capitalism. It's the best part of capitalism. When you put a bunch of
3783000	3789960	your buddies on the board, and you decide to give yourself $200 million of stock options over
3789960	3799400	three years because they're your friends, that isn't capitalism. That is the stock option culture
3801560	3811480	gone wrong. And it has been aided and abetted by increasing monopoly. Every industry in America
3811480	3817320	has become more concentrated. And in more recent years, you have had the fashion
3817400	3826200	of cutting back on capex. Capex is real life. It's up and down. It's unpredictable.
3827000	3833880	It makes your earnings volatile. Who needs capex? So let us use that money to buy our stock back.
3834520	3840680	Buying stock bags is said to be a dividend. It has many dividend-like qualities, but it has
3840680	3846040	one incredibly significant difference. And that is a dividend goes neutrally to everybody.
3847560	3855400	Stock buybacks constantly take out the least optimistic of your stockholders. And if you can
3855400	3861800	find a way month in, month out of getting rid of your least optimistic stockholders, you better
3861800	3868680	believe you're living in a different world from a bland, universally delivered dividend.
3868680	3874280	And so you push the stock price up, and the evidence is completely compatible with that view.
3875160	3886760	A combination of all these things has increased the inequality, has enabled the excessive payment
3886760	3893160	of most CEOs who, to be friendly, bring along a handful of their top management with them.
3894200	3903880	And bear down quite hard and quote efficiently, or hard heartedly, you could argue, if you were a
3903880	3911880	humanitarian, they bear down on the workers. And in that, the government has helped them along.
3912680	3920120	Government has allowed the inequality, the Gini ratio, to worsen in the US through every
3920120	3928200	administration except Bill Clinton's, where it was flat. He did not generate enough momentum
3928200	3931880	to send the pendulum swinging back a bit, but he held it for eight years.
3932680	3940440	And nobody else, including Obama did, it continued to become more unequal. And in more
3940440	3945400	recent years, of course, the whole tax structure has been moved away from capital,
3945400	3953400	therefore, by default, to labor. If you lower the tax on dividends and interest, and capital gains
3953400	3959320	tax, you must understand that you are increasing it on everything else, which is to say the ordinary
3959320	3967320	people. And that has been a very profound transition. We are now as unequal as Mexico and
3967320	3974520	Brazil. And we used to use them back in the 60s and 70s as kind of the robber barons. And now
3974520	3981320	we're with them. It's not that they have improved, it's we have joined them in an equally unequal
3981320	3987960	society. Well, tying that back to what you said earlier, about 2002 started a tripling in commodity
3987960	3998120	prices that had, that acted as a tax on our society. And to stick our fingers in the dyke,
3998120	4006440	as it were, we went to debt and central banks started to grow their balance sheet. And via,
4006440	4013320	I think it's called the cantillon effect, that those that are closest to the monetary spigot
4013320	4021400	gets the most benefits, that benefited asset holders and not the general public. So we're
4021400	4027640	papering over our economic problems with central bank reactions, but it's not helping the average
4027640	4033160	person. It's more going to the people who are ready, our asset holders.
4033880	4041640	Yeah, I don't see it as papering over. But it is undeniable that if you push up the price
4041640	4046760	of assets through pushing down interest rates, you will increase inequality because the rich
4046760	4052040	own the assets and the poor do not. And that is precisely what happened. And I think the Federal
4052040	4060200	Reserve has played the biggest role in doing that Greenspan and his, it appears almost as
4060200	4067320	acolytes since then, they have all followed pretty much his, his flight path. So yes, that
4067320	4074760	increases inequality. And when you lower the rates, you also make debt available to people
4074760	4083000	who can handle borrowing, that is to say, private equity and hedge funds and leverage in general.
4083720	4091480	That is a windfall game. You're giving free money for these marginal economic activities.
4092040	4097400	And the only purpose in which really when you look at the bottom line is the enrichment of
4097400	4103160	the people who run the private equity firms that the value created for society is negligible,
4103160	4108920	according to almost every academic study. And they have, they have pretty good lives.
4109640	4114200	But, and they are some of the main beneficiaries and, and they do change,
4115000	4120760	they change reality by making, by bidding up the price of corporations and helping increase
4121960	4129400	the overpricing of the stock market. How would the United States as the example of,
4129400	4135480	of where we both reside at the moment, how could we shift away from American capitalism
4136040	4142280	and as even possible? Or would it have to happen during a crisis or are there policies and ways
4142280	4146360	that, that we could change it ahead of a big financial crisis?
4147560	4155960	It used to be considered, for example, that a stock buyback was a manipulative and it was
4155960	4165000	illegal until the mid seventies or later, all the way from the 1930s. You know, you have to
4165000	4170920	have a policeman at the corner of broad and wall in order for things to work pretty well. You have
4170920	4178840	to keep an eye on them. And other things being even to have companies buy their stock back
4179800	4189720	whenever they feel like it. And it's, it's not a great idea. I think let them pay a dividend,
4190760	4198440	but let them keep their nose out of the stock market. It is too easily manipulated and was
4198440	4205080	banned for a very good reason and was unbanned for also a very comprehensible reason, which was to
4205080	4211480	be nice to corporations. And it is nice to corporations and it's a big part of the inequality
4213000	4220120	equation. But then you have reform of the Fed. I think the Fed has been given far too many
4220120	4226360	responsibilities. If it was just responsible for making sure there was a decent amount of
4226360	4236120	money available to deal with the economy of that age and allow, quote, the government to
4237720	4243640	have to worry about other things. But to have the Fed worried about inflation, about growth,
4243640	4251240	about this unemployment and dumb. It's to pretty well guarantee it will settle for some simple
4251240	4257800	policy of making rates cheap. Rates cheap was terrible for retirees. They were not getting
4257800	4263000	paid anything after adjustment for inflation, which people have forgotten all about after 20 years.
4263880	4270040	They, they, they were being charged for the privilege of putting their money into fixed income.
4270600	4274200	And everyone had told them that as they got older, they should have more and more
4274200	4280520	as a percentage in fixed income. And suddenly for the last 15 years, they have had little or no
4280520	4288200	return until today. Suddenly, they're now getting paid. They, they're awash with money, these people
4288200	4293240	in compared to where they were two years ago. They, you know, they're getting five, six percent,
4293240	4301640	seven percent, whereas they were getting nothing a few minutes ago. So I think reform of the Fed
4302360	4311880	and no stock buybacks. And I would be even careful about stock options. Pay people an honest amount
4311880	4316840	of money on which they pay an honest tax. And if you think they're great, pay them a lot of money.
4317640	4326360	But stock options, stock grants, stock buybacks has created in the real world, I think,
4326920	4334120	a kind of rather nasty stew that is in favor of the top handful. I wouldn't mind reforming boards,
4334120	4339400	too, to make sure they had one or two worker representatives in the larger corporations,
4339960	4346840	and, and one or two outsiders and not, not wall-to-wall friends of the chairman.
4347480	4355800	Or, or maybe one or two stand-ins conceptually as members of other species who have no say
4355800	4361720	in our economic decisions. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, when people say to me,
4362920	4373800	what should America do? My semi-frivolous answer is we should hand over our government to a
4373800	4380040	consortium of the Scandinavian countries. Norway, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Lord knows they have
4380040	4385720	to get elected. They have on paper all the problems that we have in that respect. And yet,
4386360	4392520	they have sensible policies aimed at the well-being of their people. On social measures,
4393240	4401160	they do better in everything than we do. The life expectancy in Sweden 30 years ago was two years
4401160	4407960	longer. And now it's eight years longer. When do we, when do we blow the whistle and say something
4408040	4413960	is going drastically wrong? But if you look at any measure, educational achievement,
4415560	4421480	number of women who die in childbirth, everything you could list, they score better.
4422280	4427720	I was just there in Stockholm and I was really impressed. And there's just a different feeling
4427720	4433640	there, Jeremy, in Europe more generally as well, but in Scandinavia for sure.
4433640	4441320	Let me ask you this. I didn't plan on asking you this, but it bothers me a lot.
4443000	4451400	It seems our current culture self-selects for candidates for National Political Office
4451960	4459240	senators, congressmen, presidents. It almost self-selects for sociopathic type personalities
4459240	4467560	that care about themselves in a narcissistic profit connection power sort of way. And we've
4467560	4476760	gone very far away from, I want to help this country because I feel obligated to, I feel
4476760	4484040	a fiduciary to making the future better, like a real civic responsibility. Can the politicians
4484040	4490840	that we have now understand the type of things that you're saying? You mentioned earlier enlightened
4490840	4498600	politicians, which in our current society seems like an oxymoron to me. What are your thoughts on
4498600	4504200	that? Is there hope that we could have a different system that is commensurate with not only the
4504200	4509240	financial and resource risks that you've pointed out, but the ecological and climate ones?
4510200	4518200	As an individual, I tend to agree with the tone of what you're saying, but how we would get there,
4519480	4523080	I haven't a clue. Can we get there? I haven't a clue.
4525480	4535000	It is disturbing and one should feel discouraged, and I do, but I have no idea what to do about it.
4535960	4542120	Well, I think politicians get to be politicians because they're elected by people, so I think
4542120	4547960	we need a cultural shift, but we also need institutional change. So based on what you
4547960	4554520	were earlier saying, does there need to be a fundamental change in the way business is done
4554520	4561880	as an alternative to the mega corporations, multinational corporations centered around
4561960	4568920	just shareholder value in addition to the reducing stock options and the board restrictions that
4568920	4576920	you mentioned earlier? Fundamentally, extraction of finite non-rubber resources turned to
4576920	4586440	concentrated profits is kind of our Homo sapiens 2020s model. Does that need to be shifted and how?
4587160	4593080	It feels like a huge hill, doesn't it, that we've got to push this rock up?
4593960	4601640	And how do you improve things this basic?
4604040	4611400	The rather disturbing fact for me is that the older I've gotten, the more aware I've become
4612280	4625560	of how little processed information the average guy has. He's concerned with Oshi,
4626520	4635800	that making a living, paying the rent, bombarded by political views, particularly now
4636200	4652520	in the world of X and so on. And I'm extremely sympathetic. In general, from a financial point
4652520	4662040	of view, they've been very badly treated. But the level of processed information of just
4662680	4670920	what passes for the hardest facts we can get out there is so little appreciated.
4672280	4679560	It reminds me of the famous quote from Churchill about, you know, if you want to
4680520	4686520	be frightened about the future of democracy, try five minutes with the average voter.
4687480	4701240	That will do it. And how do you address that? And it's the work of many decades and many governments
4702440	4711320	all trying to be modestly sensible. And what is the social contract in a nutshell?
4712280	4718680	That's the bottom line. How responsible for our neighbor's well-being do we feel?
4719480	4728360	How willing to sacrifice a bit for the well-being of everybody, are we? And the answer is not as
4728360	4737080	much as we used to. You know, back in the day, particularly in World War II, everyone pulled
4737160	4742040	together. Everyone knew they had to give up this, that, and the other because it was necessary,
4742040	4749560	because it was necessary. And everybody did. And they were not unhappy. So I grew up as a little
4749560	4754920	kid in World War II. And it was people spoke to each other a whole lot more than they did,
4754920	4763640	I am told, than they did a bit later. And it certainly seemed in many ways like a fairly
4763640	4770680	cheerful era, because everyone was suffering, but everyone was suffering together. Everyone was
4770680	4780200	trying hard. Almost everybody had a job, etc., etc. And the social contract was very strong.
4780200	4788200	And the same in the US, the US, the UK. And it's pretty strong in Scandinavia. It's very strong
4788200	4795320	in Japan. You know, in Japan, got to tell you this story, because that government was incompetent
4795320	4801720	on, in my opinion, on COVID. It went out of its way, and only two respects. It said,
4801720	4806760	you absolutely do not have to wear a mask if you don't want to. You absolutely do not have to be
4806760	4811000	vaccinated if you don't want to. It's your complete civic right to do what you want.
4811800	4818360	And, and they, and that was their contribution. And what did the Japanese people do? They all
4818360	4823960	wore masks, and then they all got vaccinated. And they had the oldest population in the world.
4823960	4830680	And we know that was the main variable for catching COVID. And they had one in 20,
4831480	4840040	they had 5% of the death rate that the US had. Amazing demonstration of social cohesion,
4840040	4846360	looking after each other, and also being generally fit and leaner than we are,
4846360	4851960	which is also, again, part of, in a way, part of the social contract, sensible behavior.
4852920	4861000	I have a bunch of more questions for you. I just want to thank you briefly. I know you're very
4861000	4869080	humble on your contributions, but these are the type of conversations our culture needs.
4870680	4877480	You're not humble? Well, you're humble relative to other people like you that I know. We'll say
4877480	4889960	that. Instead, I don't see, I don't see giving money away as philanthropy, because I'm not,
4889960	4896200	I'm not giving it to help the poor. I'm not giving it to the hospitals, not giving it to the schools.
4897880	4906360	Right? I am saying, we have a problem. We, the people, my grandchildren, let us do whatever we
4906360	4914840	can to stay afloat. And, you know, poverty will always be with us, and I do care about it, but
4915640	4922360	my limited resources better focus on what I think the most likely thing is to derail the whole
4922360	4929880	society. I consider everything we have spent to be defensive, defensive for my family,
4930520	4937800	and in a sense, everyone else gets a free ride. So I wouldn't want you to construe this as fabulous
4938200	4948280	philanthropy. I consider it sensible, long-term behavior for me and mine, and for everyone I'm
4948280	4957480	interested in. Fair enough. I didn't say you were generous. I said you were humble. You don't call
4957480	4965480	attention to your own accolades, but the reason I wanted to give you that praise is because our
4965560	4975560	culture rewards and lauds financial and economic success. And so you are very successful in that
4975560	4983880	realm, and yet you're putting most of your investments, your wealth, into climate research,
4983880	4992360	climate tech, because you've determined that that is our existential risk. But beyond that, you also
4992840	5001480	care about bird loss and endocrine disrupting chemicals and many other environmental issues.
5002040	5009080	So my reason for calling it out is you're one of the very few financial icons that is talking deeply
5009080	5016840	about our environmental risks. And I wish more people would integrate that into their business
5017560	5023240	decisions, into their values, and into their philanthropy. That's the point I was making there.
5024120	5033960	I don't get why so few people with money do not realize the opportunities they have to improve
5033960	5039720	the situation and how desperate it is that they do that. I just don't get it because they're smart,
5040440	5050200	and this is not rocket science. This is really obvious. I'm also very big on toxicity and we
5050200	5057080	should, and I know you've covered it in a few of your... Yeah, so Seanis Wan was one of my first
5057080	5063320	guests, and I know you funded her research on sperm decline. Why don't you talk about that a bit,
5063320	5070440	Jeremy? Yeah, and she talks about it wonderfully well, which is part of the reason we support her.
5071320	5078760	But people don't realize that toxicity is, I believe, moving faster than climate change
5079480	5089640	and will be more deadly. What we have done is we have created a world which is hostile to life
5090360	5093880	in almost every form, including our own.
5096440	5104440	To take insides, the biomass is down at least 50 percent, maybe as much as 75,
5105160	5112680	just the weight of all of those little critters. If you talk to an insect expert, too late for
5112680	5119800	you to have a podcast with EO Wilson, but together with two of my colleagues, I badgered him for
5119800	5129160	about three hours until he was obviously weak. But he couldn't get away because it is exciting
5129160	5134360	always when you're talking to people who are thrilled by what you've spent your life doing.
5134360	5141880	And we were asking him, can you give us some proof of the damage that will be done as insects
5141880	5148200	implode? And they're dropping at almost 2 percent a year. Anyone who knows anything about compounding
5148200	5158440	knows that that is catastrophic. And he believed profoundly. He was the ant man. He believed that
5158440	5166680	if we lost insects, we would probably go out of business ourselves. And he couldn't prove it.
5166680	5172600	Why couldn't he prove it? Because there hadn't been many research programs. There was no money
5172600	5180120	in insects, no funding. And the interaction of all the insects is one of the most colossally
5180120	5189080	complicated systems out there. And very, very hard to study. But in almost every environment,
5189080	5196440	we measure a great loss of insects. Similarly, if you look at human sperm count,
5196440	5201240	it's dropping at the same rate of insects between one and a half, two percent a year.
5202440	5209240	And what we did, because we can, because we're not academics, when the first Shana
5209320	5221640	Swan report came out with Hagai Levine, that's kind of co-boss, we rapidly extended it backwards
5221640	5230920	and forwards. We extended it backwards to 1945, the age of DDT and so on, hugely damaging for
5231480	5237560	insects, hugely damaging for humans. And we extended it back at half the rate that they
5237560	5246520	had proven from 1973 to 2017. And then we extended it forward for six years at just the same rate,
5246520	5251800	despite the fact that Hagai Levine said that if anything, it seemed to be accelerating.
5252360	5257400	And then we did fund the program for them to back it up for six years. And they found that,
5257400	5263720	indeed, it was accelerating. So our extension had been conservative. And we used half the rate
5264680	5270840	back to 1945, which is almost certainly conservative. And our total, which we'd been
5270840	5278840	using for years before they managed to do the follow-up, showed that there was a 60 percent
5278840	5288360	from 1945 to 2021, when we were talking about it, the 60 percent drop in the sperm count
5289080	5298200	in the developed world. And you can say, and China. And what that means is real trouble.
5298840	5307240	Now, we were over-engineered, I like to say, like a Victorian bridge. So dropping to almost 50 percent,
5307240	5312600	40, 50 percent didn't matter. But beyond that, it suddenly started to matter a lot. And we have
5312600	5319400	gone from a rounding error of young couples having trouble getting pregnant to about 15 percent.
5319400	5324840	And the international health guys come out the other day and say it's one in seven, which is
5324840	5330520	exactly what we agree with. What they didn't have the nerve to say was that 30 years earlier,
5330520	5336120	it was pretty well zero. That it had gone from nobody having trouble to one in seven having
5336120	5341160	trouble. And it's accelerating at 2 percent a year, which means come back in 20 years,
5341160	5347560	and there will be hell to pay for ordinary people around the world having children. And this is all
5347560	5354360	because of the stuff that was covered in China's one episode two, I think, that there's so many
5354360	5363240	endocrine disruptors. I believe the data suggests that pesticides on fruit and vegetables are the
5363240	5370840	main culprit. Pesticides on fruit and vegetables eaten by pregnant women are probably half of all
5370920	5379960	the damage done by chemicals to humans. And it is it is an enormous amount. There were a couple of
5379960	5388040	studies that looked at men at Harvard and Mass General, arguably best hospital or a candidate
5388040	5396200	in America. And yes, there were only like 800 of them. But for six months, they looked at them
5396200	5400520	whether they were eating more chemicals or less chemicals based on the kind of fruit
5400520	5407400	self reported. And the top quartile had twice the sperm count of the bottom quartile. And then
5407400	5413640	the following year, they did women having trouble showing up at the clinic. And the ones who had
5413640	5421480	the best diet had 65 percent successful births. And the ones who had the in the worst quarter
5422040	5430120	had had 38. Just shocking, amazing, with that kind of power in the data. Yes, you should have huge
5430120	5437160	follow up studies, no money, no follow up studies. But it suggests that we're on our way out of
5437160	5442840	business. And that's what high guy Levine says. It seems that we're going out of business. At this
5442840	5455080	rate, 2030, 40 years, and we hit the fan bang. And it scrambles everything else we talk about,
5455080	5462040	Nate, everything we're obsessing about is affected by this by this shocking drop in in
5463240	5468520	fertility. So you you you were probably not surprised to know that I have many follow up
5468520	5475720	questions to that. So I know you know, Shawna and supported her work, her recent paper, her
5475720	5482600	latest paper, which was released after the podcast I did with her a show that the sperm drop
5483320	5488440	is accelerating and be that it's not just a United States thing, it's it's global.
5489480	5494280	Right. And is it also extended nonhumans like to animals?
5495160	5500600	They covered that a little bit in the first study that there were some footnotes that suggested
5500600	5505960	that dogs had been tested and that they were just the same having just the same trouble.
5507080	5517480	But we we can deduce from insect problems that that is a major impact. We can also
5517480	5524920	sadly deduce from the insects that we we are in the cascade effect that ear Wilson and the rest
5524920	5534360	of them have so worried about, which is to say, the best study was in Germany, where they had
5535080	5544520	thousands of citizen helpers, many of whom had PhDs and so on, by the way. And they were
5545480	5551320	amazingly Germanic and thorough in their study. And they put out these nets in exactly the same
5551320	5556440	part of the forest, you know, on the same day of the year sort of thing. And they and they gathered
5556440	5563400	them all. And they were just amazed over the passage of decades, how quickly they all declined.
5563400	5571560	It was like 85% decline. Yes. Germany has not been particularly badly behaved in the last 20 years.
5571880	5579400	What is happening, in my opinion, is that they are paying the price now for the massive
5579960	5586680	breakup of the countryside that went on in World War One and World War Two, where they were kind
5586680	5593800	of, in a sense, blockaded and beginning to starve and growing food wherever they possibly could and
5593800	5600040	breaking down what had been very extensive forests in Germany and and and growing food.
5600520	5607800	And that has made Germany just less fitting for insects. And then you you tend to pull
5608440	5615080	the amount of pesticides you're throwing at it. Bear in mind, this study was done in forest preserves.
5615720	5621400	So you you have to have such a mass of chemicals that it's blowing in the wind,
5622120	5627080	running in in the streams and even in the rain, to some extent.
5629160	5634920	And and and then you have the temperature and the temperature has very little effect in Germany.
5634920	5640840	But at the same time, they did a study in Puerto Rico. And we spoke at great lengths very quickly
5640840	5647640	to the person who did that study so early that he was very, very happy to talk to us.
5648600	5656200	Later, he became quite trendy. But in this forest preserve set up by the king of Spain,
5656200	5662280	hundreds of years ago, in Puerto Rico, what they found was almost certainly that heat
5662840	5669080	is making tropical insects sterile. In the tropics, the temperature varies very seldom.
5669080	5674440	So they have a spiking heat, you know, one or two days a year, and suddenly it's 12 days a year.
5675160	5682920	And this bright spark at the University of East Anglia, grabbed one of these tropical beetles
5682920	5688920	and started to experiment with heat. And he exposed them to a week of abnormal heat.
5689640	5694520	And and they their fertility rate halved. And then after a couple of weeks to recover,
5694520	5700600	they gave them another week and they were sterile. And that element is going on in the tropics,
5701480	5709160	where it will be, of course, deadly because they are having this huge increase in extreme hot days.
5709160	5715160	And it is making the insects sterile. And so all over Brazil, the insect mass
5716680	5723240	will be dropping just as fast. I know Shauna and many people in her network
5724440	5730360	are friends of mine. One of them is on my board. And many of them tell me that
5730360	5736760	endocrine disrupting chemical pollution may be a bigger risk to humans in the future than
5736760	5745160	climate change. So wouldn't it be something if the biggest danger of a barrel of oil and natural gas
5745160	5752600	isn't the emissions, but is the plastics and related things that that come from it?
5753160	5759160	How can this be happening with so few people in the world? Everyone's focused on GDP and
5759160	5767560	consumption and Netflix and smorgasbord and vacations miss the fact that we are undergoing
5767560	5773720	ecocide of the world's insects, which are trillions of tiny robots doing tasks that
5773720	5782040	humans could never replace by ourselves. Yeah, it is an incredible, almost unbelievable
5782120	5792760	description of homo sapiens that we would be so reluctant to face up to reality, which is,
5792760	5798520	in a sense, freely available. The data is there. It's very high quality data is peer reviewed.
5798520	5805720	It's done over and over again. My conclusion is if we do not end up banning most chemicals,
5806680	5813400	including plastics, we will go out of business. By that, you mean human extinction?
5814040	5823640	Yeah, human, the loss of a reasonably stable global civilization that we may have pockets and so on
5823640	5831800	here and there. But what we know of as a reasonably acceptable life will be gone. And there are
5831880	5838280	parts where people are not exposed to chemicals and they will do much better.
5838840	5847080	But they are exposed to heat and some of those very parts, the heat and the humidity will get so
5847080	5855080	bad that they will not be able to exist in the open air doing agriculture. So they might become
5855160	5861880	hunter gatherers kind of in the pockets where they can deal with the humidity, keeping the shade
5862680	5870280	and so on and live off fruit and nuts. But life will be tough. For the stock market, by the way,
5871080	5881480	long before then, you have a situation where owning chemicals will be more exposed to lawsuits
5882120	5887160	than even oil companies, which is a very high hurdle because they're getting sued all over the
5887160	5896120	place now because they knew and they paid money to obfuscate their knowledge just like the tobacco
5896120	5904680	companies did. And they may have cost us 10 or 15 years or more. And for that, they should pay a lot
5905320	5910920	to help us get out of the hole that they have helped us dig deeper than we would without them,
5911880	5917000	but if I look around my office, pretty much everything that I'm looking at with the exception
5917000	5926520	of maybe a glass drinking jar has plastic in it. How would we remotely begin to use bamboo and hemp
5926520	5935320	and other products to replace the ubiquity of plastics in our current system? It boggles the mind.
5936200	5949080	I have an advantage over you all in that I remember being in my bathtub as a about a four-year-old,
5949080	5957560	three-year-old, and my mother came in with a little Bakelite sailing ship for my bathtub,
5957560	5964360	and this was a mottled brown plastic boat. And that was the first plastic
5965160	5972760	that came across my life. Bakelite was effectively one of the first one or two plastics ever made,
5974120	5983800	thermosetting, hard, not flexible, soft, like polyethylene. And everything around me,
5983800	5991400	as in everything, everything we fought a damn war with had no plastics, guys. It can be done.
5992840	6002120	And it is amazing how good we are at sucking it up and replacing and making do when we have to.
6002760	6011640	And this is something that most people in our business, Nate, underestimate. They think we all
6011720	6019720	kind of lie down and die because we can't have our luxuries and our two showers a day
6020360	6026280	and our plastics. And it just ain't going to be so. We're going to be tough as nails pretty damn
6026280	6033880	quickly and we're going to get by and we're going to replace, we can replace plastics. We know that
6033880	6040280	because we lived in a pre-plastic world quite recently. And we're going to have to find a way
6041240	6049640	of using materials from nature. And again, you can't grow and do that. It stresses out. We don't
6049640	6056120	have the capabilities, the resources. But if they're combined with a declining population,
6056120	6067400	we very well may. So we have to replace petroplastics with bioplastics and cellulosic fibers and so
6067400	6073640	on. And we can do that and have done it and the potential for more discoveries are massive.
6074440	6085000	We can have vats of microbes doing photosynthesis and producing a cellulosic sludge or a material
6085000	6091320	sludge. And my semi-joke is you then build buildings out of cross-laminated sludge,
6091560	6101560	having stiffened it up a bit with this and that. But it has to be biologic and industrial scale,
6102600	6112520	biologic material and food. It doesn't sound very appetizing, but you can have microbes
6112520	6119720	generate protein sludge. And you can have raspberry flavored protein sludge guaranteed
6119720	6128760	not to have any plastics, guaranteed not to have any toxins. And we can do this. We can combine
6128760	6137400	technology and all the accumulated learning of thousands of years to the task at hand. And if
6137400	6144840	we do that, we will make it. And if we're dopey and slow, we won't make it. It is, as I like to say,
6144840	6148760	the race of our lives. But we do have a chance of making it.
6148760	6156920	You're a hedge fund manager, lifelong investor, but also a philanthropist. Although you say that
6156920	6162520	that's selfishly for your own family and grandchildren to have a livable biosphere.
6163240	6168840	But given what we face and the things we've discussed on this call of biophysical limits,
6168840	6175080	climate, endocrine disrupting chemicals, changing geopolitics, do you have advice
6175880	6184120	for other philanthropists or investors who have benefited from living through a unique
6184120	6190040	period of the carbon pulse, but who may just be starting to open their eyes to the broader
6190600	6199080	the ecocide that is slowly but picking up speed happening in our world with respect to animals
6199080	6206120	and insects and ocean and CO2 in the atmosphere? I mean, this is the only habitable planet known
6206120	6211800	in the universe, this blue-green earth we all inhabit. Do you have advice for other people
6212600	6219080	who've been successful on where the world needs support that's being overlooked?
6220120	6229800	If you have money and you are getting older, I can assure you that this is the retirement
6229800	6238520	project of all retirement projects. It is capable of absorbing any unit of energy you can find.
6238760	6247080	It is absolutely fascinating. It has all the great important issues
6251000	6256280	and a lot of the people who are suddenly sitting on vast pools of money are very smart,
6257080	6263880	technologically savvy. They are ideally suited for playing a role in this area
6264760	6274920	and they will enjoy it. It will be part thrilling, challenging, exhausting, discouraging,
6274920	6281880	encouraging, all of the above, but it will not be boring. You will not be reduced to playing too
6281880	6293240	much golf. It is a great project and it's the only one that, it's the issue that matters most,
6293240	6303400	let's put it that way. By the way, I'm not a fund manager. I play no role in investing other than
6303400	6310840	the meta-level issues of should you invest in climate change? Is there a bubble? I haven't
6311400	6318440	come close to managing a hedge fund really ever. I've only done big issue top-down topics most of
6318440	6327400	my life and some traditional stockpicking long ago just to get the record straight.
6328040	6335480	Record is straight. Thank you for that. I agree with you. There is no other greater ask for society
6335480	6342280	right now than the human predicament as it pertains to the natural world and where we've arrived.
6343160	6354360	However, the financial system, which you know well, is optionality on power and resources. As
6354360	6359720	long as we have a fungible reserve currency in the world, currently the dollar, that dollar,
6359720	6366280	as you maximize it and grow the amount of it, is a claim on everything else that you can quickly
6366280	6374360	turn it into land or a different currency or ownership in a company. To do the right thing
6374360	6383720	for nature and our children and the biosphere reduces one's optionality. I told you, I used
6383720	6389320	to work at Salomon Brothers and I had clients that had $300 million and they were going to get to
6389320	6394520	$500 million and they would quit. But when they got to $500 million, their buddies had more and
6394760	6403480	it was a compulsion to grow the amount of assets. How does that dynamic merge with
6403480	6409000	growing recognition of the unbelievable tragedies that are unfolding in the natural world?
6410120	6416120	Nate, I think it's an unanswerable question from my perspective.
6416920	6425720	It is too profound and philosophical for my skill set, so I am going to dug that one.
6425720	6431080	It's the right question, but I am not the right person to answer it.
6431800	6439720	Okay, I will ask a related question. I know that you also fund work at universities,
6439720	6446280	especially on climate. I'm going to start asking this question of all my guests because it's my
6446280	6454040	belief that young humans, especially those in grad school or postdocs, are an incredible,
6454040	6461960	underutilized human resource to tackle some of the problems that you've integrated on this call.
6462920	6468360	So, but they're working within an economic structure within the academy
6469000	6473880	that is kind of linear and doesn't integrate the things that we've been discussing.
6474520	6479720	So, in your field, climate, oceans, endocrine disrupting, extinctions,
6479720	6488440	how that fits together, can you suggest some really big questions for postdocs, grad students,
6488520	6494600	universities around the world that need research, need answers that are happening right now?
6495880	6507160	What is really the threat in epigenetic problems changing the way that
6507160	6515080	genes express themselves after exposure to chemicals? We really have to follow that up.
6515080	6521880	We really have to follow up the sperm count studies and what can be done, what is causing the
6521880	6529480	damage. They really don't know. You know, Shana thinks it's mainly the forever chemicals. I think
6529480	6540760	it's mainly pesticides on fruit and vegetables. And it isn't known, but we should have important
6540760	6546360	follow-up studies. The same with insects. We may be taking, we may be teetering on the edge
6547160	6553960	of our own destruction and we just don't know it because no one has ever funded insect research.
6555160	6562600	And you could take all our money, throw it at any one of these things and it would kind of
6563560	6568760	still be a drop in the bucket, although it would certainly help.
6570760	6581080	We have decided to throw all our money in a sense at green tech research because we think it buys
6581080	6590840	us time for governments and new rich people to get the point and start to change the way they
6590840	6599080	spend their money and the way the government spends its money by time through technology
6599800	6607000	to push the window away before we go off the cliff. But as you kind of implied, these are not
6607000	6615480	long-term cures. These are just buying time for the long-term actions to be taken. And the most
6616200	6623400	impressive one to me is population reduction. That I think is pretty well baked in the pie.
6624600	6630920	We didn't cover one thing, which is the shockingly politically incorrect. And therefore,
6630920	6641640	we should probably do it. And that is the main reason for population crash. It's not a population
6641640	6647800	crash because of the old fogies living longer, but it's a baby cohort crash. The main reason
6647800	6657640	is the choice, obviously. More educated women are realizing that many children just impinge on
6657640	6665080	their flexibility of their life and their ability to kind of fully realize themselves. Anyway, so
6665080	6674200	we have this huge correlation between female education and fertility. And secondly, postponement,
6674840	6681720	everyone wants quite correctly to get their career going before they interrupt it. And that makes a
6681720	6688520	lot of sense. But when you postpone, you're not nearly as fertile. And I believe it interacts
6688520	6697480	with toxicity in a nonlinear way. So it doesn't really matter if you have some toxic exposure
6697480	6704280	when you're a 16-year-old. And Nigerian, just to pick on a place with a very high fertility rate,
6704920	6715320	because you have many years to make it up. But you're a 39-year-old Parisian worker,
6716280	6723720	you may find you simply can't have a child. So that's reason number two. The reason number three
6724680	6731480	is toxicity, reduced sperm count, increasing miscarriages, and all of the lesser problems
6732200	6737400	that come with chemical exposure, which is getting worse rapidly and will soon be
6737960	6743800	overtaking postponement into second place. And then there is the one that no one talks about.
6744440	6753480	And that is, in addition to the measurable reduction in sperm count, etc., there is a hard
6753480	6762600	to measure effect on hormone interference, on your willingness, your eagerness to procreate.
6763720	6772840	Every study, as far as I'm aware, and I've tried to look at them, every study on sexual activity
6772840	6780600	says it's going down. In each age group, pregnancies in 16-year-olds and younger,
6780600	6787080	dropping rapidly. That's a lack of willingness to procreate or a lack of willingness to do the
6787080	6796840	act that results in procreation? No, a lack of interest in procreation. In other words, you are
6796840	6809000	not motivated. You're not the 22-year-old of circa 1955. You have less interest. And
6809240	6827160	that was available implication of the study from Shana Swann and Haggai Levine.
6829480	6837560	And it may be the most powerful force of all. 40% of South Korean 40-year-olds have not had a child.
6838520	6851960	And the activity in terms of dating and so on has really dwindled down so that it's the women's
6851960	6860760	night out and the guys playing competitive computer games on a Saturday night and not going to the
6860760	6870920	bar and hooking up or whatever we call it. This is, I think, potentially very profound
6870920	6876920	and maybe the most important single consequence of chemical exposure.
6876920	6881240	But can that be described by chemical exposure or could it also be
6881880	6889560	described by the subconscious recognition of climate change and limits to growth and other
6889640	6900040	things that people just don't have that inner freedom and a spree decor of discovery and all
6900040	6905640	that, that there's just a pall and that we've become the walking worried? I don't know.
6906600	6917400	Well, I can hazard a strong guess. As a betting man, I would put a very large bet on this. In the
6917480	6922440	community in which we move, we bump into people who fall into your description.
6923720	6931800	As a percentage of young people, I think they are pretty small and confined to certain
6931800	6938920	countries and socioeconomic groups. In China, for example, I would expect that to be a very small
6938920	6950600	fraction of the opinion. But the proof of the pudding is that in the Korea, Japan, China,
6951880	6962120	and probably when measured correctly, India, they're all acting as if, forget the choice,
6962920	6968520	I'm just not interested. And that component is accelerating. And that, of course,
6968520	6974120	is a real threat to the species. And I think this is a real threat to the species.
6974760	6978440	But it cuts right across all the other things we're working on, doesn't it?
6979560	6986040	If our population is going to turn out to be substantially less than the low estimate of
6986040	6996280	the UN by 2100 in just 70 years, and then much less by 2200, the main things we have to worry
6996280	7004280	about maybe is holding society together. The demand for all the bad things like oil and copper
7004280	7013160	will drop like stone. But the stress on society and economy will be pretty high.
7013720	7017560	I don't know enough about that. I'm going to have to look into that. But you're right,
7017560	7022840	it would affect everything else, including the paying back of debt.
7023880	7031720	That is such an important point about the payback of debt. I started out
7031720	7037720	life studying big American industrial corporations who were in decline, international
7037720	7045480	harvester. And the retirees had certain obligations. And the workforce supporting them
7046440	7054040	were declining. The company was declining, but the retirees were static. And that is
7054600	7060680	a very similar echo here in the following way. The thing we haven't talked about
7061640	7072360	is the cost of doing what we have to do. We think it's 50 trillion increment to green the economy.
7072360	7078600	And the reason it's so low is because you have to buy a car anyway, you have to build a new factory
7078600	7086360	anyway, you have to build up grade the grid anyway, and you combine that with greening it.
7086920	7094360	And so it's a relative bargain, 50, maybe 75 trillion dollars. You then have the accumulated
7094360	7102600	damage, which between now and 100 years is probably going to be somewhere in the range of
7103640	7109960	30 to 100 trillion. It's a very wide error bar. How can we put a price tag on
7110840	7115640	insects or ecosystems or the Amazon? I'm just talking about floods,
7116760	7123400	floods, droughts, and food problems. In other words, old-fashioned simply measured pain,
7123400	7129000	which is going through the roof as we sit. But 10 years ago was really quite marginal.
7129880	7139080	And the biggest one of all, and that is we're going to have to end up when we get to
7140520	7149960	a zero carbon industrial system, we're going to end up with, we believe, about 550 parts per million
7149960	7156920	plus or minus 50. That's if we do better, try harder, and have a steady stream of innovations.
7157800	7165800	We started out life at 280, we're at 420. If we do a better job, we might peak this out at 550,
7165800	7172280	but we've got to go back from 550 to 300. That's 250 parts per million. If we don't,
7172840	7180600	the ice caps will melt, we'll have 200 feet rise and so on, and a lot of the fires and floods and
7180600	7185880	transference of the Amazon to Savannah, et cetera, will keep going. So we have to do it.
7186520	7191800	And when you're green in the economy, you have a lot of offsetting virtues. You drive, as I do,
7191800	7197800	a Model 3 is the best car I've ever got in. You go through Boston in an electrified world in 20
7197800	7203480	years. It's the cleanest Boston we'll have ever been since its inception. It will have huge health
7203480	7208440	payoffs, by the way, that no one talks about. So there are lots of offsetting virtues,
7209000	7217560	but taking out 250 parts per million is an absolute dead weight for which you will not
7217560	7223960	see any direct advantage. Your survival depends on it, but you will not see any immediate payoff,
7223960	7231000	like you will with greening the economy. And we think we'll be ingenious and terrific and we'll
7231000	7237960	get the cost down to $50 a ton, and currently $500, $1,000 a ton, but we'll get it down to 50.
7237960	7243400	That's what we do well. When we scale this up, it will be brilliantly cheaper, $50 a ton,
7244120	7255880	but it's a lot of tons. And the total cost turns out to be $125 trillion. In other words,
7255880	7264120	maybe twice as much as greening the economy. And we're going to take decades to do it.
7264360	7272680	And if the population drops steadily, we have this pension fund problem that you're alluding to,
7273320	7282280	and that is, if we take a long time, and we probably will, if we peak at $550
7282840	7289400	one day, and the population is already, in terms of the workers, has already halved,
7290360	7296680	they have twice the burden. And then as they pay for it over 100 years, it halves again.
7297400	7303880	By the end, they've quadrupled that burden. And it's a pretty damn big burden anyway. So there is
7303880	7310680	an unfortunate intersection between a declining population, which is good for most things,
7310680	7317080	and the cost of decarbonizing and extracting the excess carbon, which will be borne by few
7317080	7323080	or few people. So I'm going to have to have you back to discuss the greening of the economy,
7323080	7328360	because there's so many rabbit holes on that, that I would love your expertise and wisdom on.
7328360	7334520	But for right now, let me ask you this. What are the most promising ways that you've come across
7334520	7340840	for actually subtracting carbon from the atmosphere or things on the come that haven't
7340840	7346840	really been proven yet that you're optimistic about? Regenerative agriculture, geoengineering,
7347160	7354040	cloud seeding, marine cloud brightening. Do you have any opinion or optimism in that field?
7354040	7360120	I am optimistic on everything you mentioned, actually. I think we will have to get involved
7360120	7369880	into cloud brightening, sort of relatively low risk, relative high payoff. Certainly,
7370040	7379320	geoengineering, everything to do with agriculture, we're desperate. We can't be too
7380760	7386040	careful. We have to be careful, but we can't be ultimately careful because we're running out of
7386040	7394920	time. And it's something that we can really do a good job at changing the characteristics of
7394920	7401160	the agricultural process and plants in general, so that they sequester a little more carbon and
7401160	7411640	require less energy to grow and so on. One of my favorite down to earth little projects is a robot
7411640	7420760	that runs slowly on its own across the field, gathering about half the corn stubble and converting
7420760	7428200	it at a very high temperature into biochar. The problem with biochar is wonderful for
7428200	7432920	microorganisms. It's wonderful for water retention. It really improves the soil.
7433560	7439480	And the problem with it is that you have to truck biomass, which is fatal. And then when
7439480	7446920	you've converted it into biochar, you truck it to a farm and then you distribute it on the farm.
7446920	7454440	It's all horrifically energy intensive, but this little machine is there. It takes the stubble
7454440	7461960	right there and converts it to biochar right there. And it does it potentially very cheaply.
7464360	7473480	Incrementally, something close to $10 a ton or maybe zero, because the value of the soil enhancement
7474120	7480680	is enough to justify the process. And the carbon sequestration, which is very substantial,
7480680	7488600	is a free good. Think about that. So that fits in what we call the too good to be true category.
7490520	7498840	Which there are quite a few. I keep coming back to we're going to have to value the natural world
7498840	7505960	more than our current economic system does. And that is going to take money and it's going to
7505960	7514360	take money and resources away from stock car driving or Las Vegas junkets or Disneyland or
7515800	7521960	other things in the society. So who is going to pay for that? Is it going to be investors or
7521960	7531320	governments or is it a cultural value shift that each of us tithe 10% of our income above a
7531320	7536280	certain amount towards the natural world? Because then I think there's a lot more things that become
7536280	7543320	possible among the things you mentioned. But until we get to that point, we're just outsourcing our
7543320	7548840	wisdom to the financial market and the financial market optimizes capital and not the environment.
7549640	7561320	Yes. And we will either improve starting with the social contract, our attitude to we're all in
7561320	7571320	this together, or we will in the end probably fail. In the meantime, we're saying to ourselves,
7572280	7583560	that is a big ask and one with uncertain outcome. We know we can improve these things through
7584520	7592840	technology. We know we can make it better. We know we can knock years off the research life span.
7593880	7600920	Let us do what we know we can do that fits into a system that works pretty well.
7602040	7607080	The venture capital world is the pride and joy of the American capitalist system, in my opinion.
7608120	7617720	It is unlike so many things where far better to be in Denmark, it's far better to be in the US
7617720	7624760	for venture capital. We suck in all the very best people. We have 15 of the 20 great research
7624760	7631480	universities that are integral to the flow of ideas. We take risk better than any other group on
7631480	7640680	the planet with maybe Australia closed behind. And this is it. This is the one little nook and
7640680	7649240	cranny of the system that is great. People are flocking in from around the world into green
7649240	7655880	tech. The green tech world is unlike any other quadrant of capitalism. They are actually thoroughly
7655880	7663560	concerned with the problem. And it's a big part of their driving force that this is an existential
7663560	7669960	risk that they're doing something about. This is really heartening. I joke that they may get
7669960	7676280	drummed out of the capitalism club because they have all these benevolent attitudes.
7677240	7683960	Could you imagine what green tech and the demographic you just described could accomplish
7684600	7692520	if we had not only a carbon tax but a tax on all non-renewable inputs to the economy
7692520	7698040	that would give us the right signals for the downslope of the carbon pulse and then you
7698040	7703480	could apply all that ingenuity and creativity towards technological responses.
7704520	7711480	And there is also the idea of the circular economy. And in France, they're moving to make it
7712600	7723560	expensive to design things that cannot be recycled, cannot be repaired. And in that sense,
7723560	7731080	the French are odd ducks as we think. But they do some things very, very well. And I think this is
7731080	7741720	such an enlightened attitude. And a lot of these problems are quite specific. So if you're in
7741720	7746520	Denmark and you solve the chemical problem, you will simply live a lot longer and be healthier.
7746520	7754200	And eventually, the other people will follow you. The trouble with climate change is it's
7754200	7763080	fungible. And there's a free rider effect. But we really depend on these handful of people who
7763080	7768760	will set a good example and prove that it can be done. Prove that, in fact, the economy in France
7769720	7776200	10 years later starts to grow a little faster than the others because they're insisting on
7777160	7782680	more recycling and so on, a more circular, successful economy.
7783320	7789800	Last question before I get to the final questions. There was a science article,
7789800	7796760	I think around eight or nine years ago that showed that if the United States went it alone
7796760	7805080	and did the Paris Accord and did everything correctly for climate, that by the year 2100,
7805080	7811720	it would make an infinitesimal difference into the global temperature. In other words,
7812920	7819240	it has to kind of be a global thing or it's not going to matter. So do you think there's
7819240	7825080	possibility of global cooperation on climate endocrine disrupting chemicals and other
7825080	7830920	environmental risks? Or does it just happen nation by nation and patchwork way?
7831960	7843160	I fear that it will be patchwork and in toxicity that works because people can see who is pulling
7843160	7853240	ahead. However, I think as things get desperate, there is a decent chance that we will start to
7853240	7861960	cooperate. People are a little stupid but they're now completely stupid and if we start to go to
7861960	7870440	hell in a hand basket, will we not start cooperative ventures on a global carbon tax
7871160	7878120	equilibrating policy where every product is treated the same way? Yes, I think that will happen.
7878680	7886600	In even more enlightened stuff, it may or may not. We are going to make it, on 20 of these
7886600	7892440	questions, we're going to make it if we are slightly more to the enlightened side than the
7892440	7902200	unenlightened side. We really exist well within a range of success and failure. I think even with
7902840	7910040	our deficiencies, we're inventive. Taken all together, we can make it and we can fail.
7910840	7918040	This is very unusual that this is not a done job. This is not certain that we will fail. It is not
7918040	7925160	certain by by any means that we will succeed and we will have hundreds of these little choices
7925160	7931320	where some people will be more enlightened, some people will copy them, other people will be a pain
7931320	7938120	in the earth. They will send the country back for 10 years and the sum of all of these will decide
7938120	7944120	whether we model through or whether we don't. That is very well said and that is the conclusion
7944120	7950760	that I came to when I started this podcast is we need more people to see the game board and how
7950760	7957000	things fit together so that we can make better decisions and tilt towards the more enlightened.
7957800	7963720	So, final few questions, Jeremy. You've thought about these issues for a very long time. You're
7963720	7971000	85 years young and you are uber focused on the things that really matter. Do you have any personal
7971000	7977560	advice to the viewers of this program who are aware of climate change, endocrine disrupting
7977560	7987800	chemicals, the flatness in our economy for the people in the lower three quintiles, etc.?
7987800	7991880	Do you have any personal advice? And before I answer that, I just want to say
7993320	8001640	to the average, to the typical viewer, I have just spent 30 or 40 hours
8002600	8012680	skimming through and occasionally really listening to Nate's 95 podcast and I have
8012680	8020120	by no means covered them but I've tried to select the ones most relevant to me. I have a real
8020120	8027320	feeling for the style and what's going on and let me say this is the kind of effort
8028120	8035720	that if it takes wing, by the time you've done three or four hundred of these becomes
8035720	8043720	the authoritative source that people go to get exposed to this line of reasoning.
8045080	8048200	This is one of those things that can tip the scale a bit.
8049480	8054360	Well, thank you for saying that. I can't imagine doing 300 but I'll keep going.
8055240	8062040	Of course you can imagine doing 300. What sort of thought is that? I have about four people
8063160	8071080	that you should really talk to but that's only two or three years from now. That should be a
8071080	8076600	piece of cake. You should be aiming at a thousand. There's just about a thousand
8077400	8082520	useful people to talk to, I should thank. The advice is
8087560	8096600	one of the main things in life is purpose and most people born in the history of man have not
8096600	8104920	had particular purpose other than staying alive. We have an opportunity to not just stay alive,
8104920	8109480	earn a living, feed yourself, but we have an opportunity to change the outcome
8110760	8121160	for future generations stretching out for more or less ever. This is the purpose of all purposes,
8121160	8129880	you lucky people. If you do not attach yourself to this problem, you are missing the point.
8129880	8134920	You are not paying attention. You're not being intelligent. You're not showing judgment.
8134920	8139160	This is the issue that you should attach as much as your life to as you can.
8141640	8145960	There is something to be said from make as much money as you can and deploy the money
8146840	8154840	to people who know better about other things. That's perfectly acceptable or become an expert in
8154840	8165640	any one of the thousands of jobs that are required to make it out of this mess. It is a
8165640	8175640	wonderful time to be alive in terms of purpose. For my money, purpose is one of the two or three
8175640	8183400	things that make life worth living. I agree. How would you adjust that advice to a young human
8184280	8192280	18 to 25 listening to this, becoming aware of these things? Sure, purpose, but do you have
8192280	8197640	any other advice for young humans? Yeah, I mean, it's the same advice really. Just
8198680	8207320	pick a career that is useful. Tilt yourself to science and pick a branch of science that is
8207320	8216280	relevant of which many are to this field. If you're a bit older, think about running a startup
8219560	8226440	and make sure the startup has a chance of being really important. Think about getting into green
8226440	8235240	venture capital because you can have some leverage and raise some money and show some scale.
8235640	8242760	No, there are plenty of opportunities here. This is a fortunate time.
8243960	8248360	If you could, this is a question I ask all my guests, and if you listen to 20 or 30 of my
8248360	8253320	episodes, you know this, if you could wave a magic wand, Jeremy, and there was no personal
8253320	8259080	recourse to your decision, what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures?
8260040	8270120	I suppose that's easy. I would wave a magic wand and have the global population become one billion.
8272200	8277560	I like to say that we live at such a finely tuned part of the race of our lives
8278200	8282280	that if you imagine a world where we have the population of 1900
8282920	8288040	and the technology of today, we have no problem. We've made it.
8289000	8294120	If we had the technology of 1900 and the population of today, we're toast. We have no hope.
8295080	8301560	The whole of this race has played out in the hundred year gap between population growth
8301560	8308440	and technology. It's quite remarkable. That's well stated. I hadn't heard it put that way before.
8309320	8316280	Therefore, finding yourself at one billion tomorrow, I think we have enough time
8317000	8321880	and resources and talent to muddle our way through.
8323240	8330760	This has been quite a conversation. I would like to have you come back maybe as a roundtable guest
8330760	8336920	or to take a deeper dive. Is there a topic that we didn't cover today, maybe esoteric,
8337480	8342440	but relevant to our futures that if you were to come back and take a deep dive on that topic,
8343160	8350920	does something come to mind? Well, my topics are toxicity, population,
8352760	8359960	and the viability of the animal world, insect world, resource limitations,
8360920	8368760	particularly metals, energy, inequality, deficiencies in capitalism.
8372920	8380840	We did a pretty good job of at least getting into some of that of each topic.
8382760	8387080	Well, I hope this podcast is watched. And bubbles. That's my only other thing.
8387160	8396520	And bubbles. Well, we're in numerous bubbles at the moment. Thank you for thinking and caring
8396520	8403320	about these things during your career. And thank you for your time today and to be continued,
8404120	8410440	I hope. And thanks, Jeremy. And thank you, Nate, the same way. Thank you for your efforts.
