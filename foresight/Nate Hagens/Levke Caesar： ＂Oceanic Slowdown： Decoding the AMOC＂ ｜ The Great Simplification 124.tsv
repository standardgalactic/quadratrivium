0	6640	We know that the AMOG is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down.
6640	11680	We see from paleo data evidences that it might have happened before.
11680	18320	And we are not really much closer to knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing,
18320	23280	in terms of how much degree of global warming would be okay before the AMOG could collapse
23280	27840	than we were like 20, 30 years ago, even though we know much more.
30320	37040	Today's conversation is with Climate Physicist Levka Caesar.
37680	44480	Levka works at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. Her current
44480	53440	work primarily focuses on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, aka the AMOG, and its
53440	59440	pivotal role in our climate system. Levka's research has produced seminal work on the past
59520	66960	evolution of this important ocean current. In October of 2023, she also assumed the role of
66960	73520	scientific lead for the newly launched Planetary Boundary Science Initiative at the Potsdam
73520	80240	Institute. This conversation was a deep dive on all things AMOG, what we know, what we don't know,
80880	86880	and what speculations are for the future of this critical component of our planetary systems.
86880	92640	Please welcome Levka Caesar. Levka, great to see you.
94640	97760	Yeah, great to talk to you, Nate. Thanks for inviting me.
97760	105840	You are welcome. So usually when I host guests, I have their location on my globe, but since we're
105840	112480	going to be talking about the AMOG, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation of the Atlantic
112480	121680	Ocean, I highlighted the Atlantic Ocean as the theme location of the podcast. So you are a world
121680	128880	renowned expert on ocean issues, especially the AMOG, and that's going to be the topic of our
129920	137600	deep dive today. But let me first ask you this. How old were you, and what were you thinking
138320	144160	when you first decided I want to be a scientist studying how Earth's natural systems work?
145200	149920	That's a very interesting question because I have to admit I'm actually coming from the space
149920	155440	science side. So when I was young, and I think even at the age of like eight, nine, I was really
155440	161200	interested in the formation of black holes, the life cycle of stars. Then I had a period when I
161200	167920	wanted to become an astronaut, and that basically sparked me to study physics, and it was then
167920	172960	later during my studies that I kind of realized I want to do something that's closer to home and
172960	179200	that feels a little bit more relevant. So I still really believe that astrophysics is really cool,
179200	186080	and I don't know, physicists might call it sexy in terms of the data, the mechanisms, but yeah,
187040	191440	I guess I was in about like 22 when I really did my bachelor's in physics that I realized
192000	198320	physics can also be applied to our planet, to the Earth system, and can explain so many interesting
198320	205200	and relevant phenomena, whether the ocean circulations that, yeah, basically then when I
205200	213840	decided to shift my focus. Excellent. I shifted my focus when I was on Wall Street and realized
213840	221120	that the externalities were not included in our prices, and we were in for a phase shift during
221120	230160	my lifetime of the ecology and natural systems on Earth. So as you're well aware, global heating
230160	240320	is in the news. Lots of people are worried and aware of climate change. Oceans are a very integral
240320	248000	part of the climate system, but they don't get as much coverage in the news. There are multiple
248000	254320	ocean risk that we face, ocean acidification, decline in oxygen content, sea level rise,
255200	262000	overfishing, lots of different aspects. But what we're going to talk about today is the ocean
262000	269680	currents and how they change and how they may be changing in the near and distant future. So can
269680	277520	you start us off by describing what the AMOCK is and how critical it is to the function of climate
277520	285280	as we know it today? Yes, sure. So the AMOCK, which is short for Atlantic Meridional Overturning
285280	291280	Circulation, and I like that name, even though I guess for a lot of people it's kind of difficult to
291280	297040	say it first, but it's actually a good description of what the system is. So the AMOCK is a system
297040	306240	of ocean currents, covering the Atlantic, therefore Atlantic Meridional, because that's the geological
306240	312080	term basically for saying something is moving in the north-south direction. And while the AMOCK is
312080	317680	basically, when depending on where you look, moving in any direction, the main transport is on the
317680	325680	north-south line. So the AMOCK is transporting a lot of warm saline water at or just below the surface
325760	331040	of the ocean northward in the Atlantic. It's really coming even from the southern ocean,
331040	337120	so it's really transporting the whole length of the Atlantic, these water masses, and then as
337120	345520	basically it's going over the equator through the tropics and then entering the colder subpolar
345520	352000	north Atlantic region. And basically with that it's coming into regions of colder air masses
352000	357520	above the surface of the ocean and a lot of this heat is then being transported or basically
357520	364400	released to the atmosphere. The water, the surface water is cooling down and cold water is denser
364400	370320	compared to warmer water and this is then basically leading to a sinking of the water masses, which
370320	376960	we call convection in physical terms basically. And these water masses then that are sinking
376960	383440	down in the subpolar north Atlantic. And while the locations are the Erminger Sea, the Nordic Seas,
384400	388240	the Leoparder Sea, but I guess if you're not an oceanographer, then probably you wouldn't know
388240	394320	what these ocean regions are called. So it's basically around the Greenland ice sheet, so to
394320	399600	the south of it, to the east of it, and there you have those places of this deep water formation.
399600	405760	So the sinking of surface water masses that are being cooled down by the atmosphere, getting denser,
405760	410720	getting heavier, and then are going to deeper ocean layers. And when I say deeper, I mean
410720	417360	depths of two to three kilometers. And then these water masses together from the southward return
417360	424480	flow of the AMOC, now transporting colder water southward at depths towards basically back towards
424480	431200	the equator region. And it's mainly this exchange of warm surface water going towards the subpolar
431200	436720	region and colder, deeper water going back, that leads to a lot of energy transport by the AMOC.
438080	444240	Okay, let me let me pause you there for a little bit of history. And I'm going to pretend that I
444240	452640	don't know much about this, which I don't really have to pretend much. We've had the AMOC current
452640	460000	forever, or since there were seven continents, right? I mean, we've been aware of this and able
460000	466000	to look back in time. And this current that you described has been there for a long time, right?
467520	473200	It has been there for a long time. Forever is probably difficult to say.
474480	482480	But yeah. And is this a new, I know there's a new paper out by your colleagues, I believe,
483440	491360	and yourself, on the risks that the AMOC poses in the near future. But is awareness of this
491360	495520	current? Is this a relatively new thing? Or is scientists known about this for a long time?
497440	504240	Actually, no, there are, within the scientific community, this kind of starts with Henry Stommel,
504240	510960	who's one of, yeah, famous oceanographer, who already in the 60s basically assessed that this
511040	515600	overturning circulation, which first of all is special to the Atlantic, so we do not have this
515600	522000	kind of overturning circulation in the Pacific, that it exists, that it's very special in the
522000	527600	sense that normally when we look at either ocean currents or atmospheric currents, they would always
527600	533280	transport heat from the tropics to the polar regions, because basically the sun is heating the
533280	538000	earth in the sense we have most of the radiation going towards the tropics and then less towards
538000	545120	the polar regions. And as is usually the case, basically the systems thrive towards
546320	551040	distributing the heat more homogeneously. So basically, when you have a lot of heating at
551040	556240	one place and no heating at the others, you have a movement of either water or air masses
556240	560800	from the heated region to the colder regions. But the AMOC is special because it can actually
560800	566960	transport heat above the equator. It's transporting heat from the southern to the northern hemisphere.
567600	573680	And that makes it really special. And that the system is there, basically, and why it can be
573680	581040	there, which is like a delicate balance, basically of freshwater, saline water, heating and cooling
581920	587200	in the Atlantic. That is something that has been known, as I said, for several decades now.
587760	593760	And also an understanding of the mechanism that it doesn't have to be there, so that in principle
593760	600480	it's possible that there is no AMOC, or theoretically we could even say the AMOC could be flowing the
600480	606640	other way around. So as I said, we have a northward surface flow and a southward deep flow. We could
606640	612480	also have a circulation in the Atlantic where we have a southward surface flow, deep water formation
612480	617680	basically in the southern ocean, and then a northward deep water return flow. But that's not
617680	623040	the case. The way, basically, our earth system is set right now through the fact that we have
623680	628720	the heating in the tropics, we have then evaporation of water masses, of the warm water masses in the
628720	635360	tropics, and more precipitation rainfall in the north Atlantic. This balance is basically
635360	640960	played out at the moment that we have the AMOC as it is flowing today with the northward surface flow.
641920	650160	Okay, so I'm going to jump around here, but give us the punchline first and then we'll backfill from
650160	658720	there. What is happening to the AMOC now and what are the risks or the scenarios you see in
659280	664080	coming decades or centuries or millennia based on what's already built in?
664160	671600	Yeah, so what we see now is basically a slowdown of this circulation system, very simply said.
671600	677360	And while scientifically it's always a little bit difficult to give exact numbers, everything
677360	686160	hints towards a slowdown of about 15% over the last few decades. And again, it's more difficult to
686160	691360	say why something is happening compared to then just observing it and saying it is happening,
691360	696960	but we do understand under which circumstances, what are the mechanisms that could drive such a
696960	703280	slowdown. And this is mainly related to a freshwater influx into the sub-poller north Atlantic.
703280	708800	So I already kind of said that what is driving this ocean circulation is really a formation of
708800	714960	deeper water masses, a sinking of water masses in the sub-poller north Atlantic around Greenland.
714960	720160	And then basically when you have water sinking at some place, you have to have an inflow at the
720160	725440	surface that is kind of filling this gap just due to volume conservation. And then this deep water
725440	730960	has to go somewhere. And basically with how the earth is set, the rotation of the earth,
730960	737120	the way it is basically that we have a southward deep water flow and then this surface northward
737120	742800	flow. But if we now put a lot of freshwater into the sub-poller north Atlantic, what is happening
742800	751040	is that the surface water there get lighter, less dense. This is because the density of ocean water
751040	755200	depends on two things, the temperature, which I already mentioned, colder water being denser
755200	760880	than light water, but also the salinity. And here I guess it also makes a lot of sense if I put more
760880	766880	salt, more matter into something, I make it heavier and denser. Now if we put a lot of very
766880	772800	fresh water, so no salinity basically into the sub-poller north Atlantic, then we lighten the
772800	778080	surface water and we hinder, slow down this deep water formation, the sinking of water masses.
779120	784640	Now that's in principle, that is understood, not just in principle, it is understood. The thing is
784640	791120	that in real life, it's not happening in the way that we have at every minute, every place in the
791120	796400	sub-poller north Atlantic deep water formation. So it's not like we sometimes call the over-turning
796400	800560	circulation a conveyor belt, and I think there you mentioned something that is continuously
801280	806800	going, flowing, but actually the deep water formation is happening from time to time,
806800	811120	mainly in the winter time, because that's when the atmosphere is specifically cold.
811120	816480	It's also then cooling the surface water the most, and then it's also happening at specific
816480	822800	locations because it's really a delicate balance of what exactly is the local surface temperature,
822800	828400	atmospheric temperature above that, what's the local salinity value, and that's also why it's
828400	833840	difficult for us to say when are we really stopping this process, because we do know that we're now
833840	838240	putting more fresh water in the sub-poller north Atlantic. The greenland ice sheet is melting,
838240	844800	under climate change we see increased precipitation over this region, so also more fresh water,
845440	850400	but whether or not and how much this influencing the over-turning circulation really depends on
850400	860400	where exactly is what happening. So which is more, has a higher forcing component of salinity or
860400	867040	temperature, like a small change in salinity or a small change in temperature, which causes the
867040	876640	water to not descend or to descend faster? That's a very good question, and it depends.
877120	884640	So because the relationship basically between temperature, salinity, and density is not linear,
884640	890320	so basically how much, when I change the temperature a little bit, it matters whether I change it from
890320	897040	20 to 21 degrees or whether I change it from 5 to 4 degrees. The differences or the effects on
897040	902560	density are different and the same is with salinity. So we can't just talk about the change, we would
902560	908320	have to also talk about the background state and then look at the change to say what is more important
908320	914640	and then also when we look at it right now, in terms of the more dominant driver is actually the
914640	921360	temperature, but in terms of what we human change and how we change it, it's actually, the system
921360	929040	is more sensitive to salinity changes right now. So here's a dumb question, but it's my podcast,
929120	939520	so I can ask some dumb questions. When water evaporates from the ocean, the ocean is a salt water,
939520	944960	but when it evaporates, the salt doesn't evaporate, the salt stays in the ocean,
944960	953840	so the clouds just get non-saline water droplets, and the part two of the question is,
954800	960640	as we head into a world with a higher standard deviation of precipitation, floods and droughts,
960640	970320	et cetera, does this changing precipitation pattern over the oceans and supposedly indirectly
970320	974880	over the land which would run off into the ocean, does that higher standard deviation
975840	982320	indirectly affect the salinity of the melt water in the oceans and change this amok?
983200	987680	So first of all, your first question, comment, I'm just going to comment that was right,
987680	994240	so basically rain is freshwater and the salt just stays in the ocean when it evaporates,
994240	1000400	which is why when we have more precipitation over an ocean region, we are freshening the water there,
1000400	1007360	we are decreasing the salinity, and yes, I mean the thing is, unless with global warming where we
1007360	1013040	can basically say it might depend on the region, but in general we see global warming globally,
1013040	1018160	so there's warming close to everywhere, when we talk about the changes in precipitation,
1018800	1024880	there it's way more difficult, so we have a tendency of saying, okay, the regions that now
1024880	1029680	receive precipitation are likely going to receive more and the drier regions are going to be drier
1029680	1035120	in the future, but that's like more a general thing, it doesn't have to be true for every place,
1035680	1041200	but we can see in our climate simulations that yeah, there's a tendency towards more
1041200	1046400	precipitation over the regions where the deep water formation for the amok is happening,
1046400	1051360	and that in itself is basically bad for the amok because it can slow it down,
1052000	1057120	but that alone wouldn't be the problem, I think a bigger problem is actually the melting of the
1057120	1062400	ice sheets because due to the reason what you said, also snow basically, I mean that's frozen
1062400	1068160	precipitation, so that is also pure freshwater, and all this melting runoff coming from the
1068160	1074240	green and ice sheet and entering the sub-Polaroid Atlantic, that's actually potentially very harmful
1074240	1081200	for the amok, but there are also other effects, just basically the surface warming that we see
1081920	1089200	globally in the oceans could also hinder the or slow down the amok because it's also making
1089200	1095120	the surface water lighter, enhancing what we call the stratification of the ocean, really meaning
1095120	1100480	that there's not a lot of vertical mixing, and therefore also, yeah, tindering the deep water
1100480	1108320	formation, so there are really multiple effects overlaying this, and I could actually get on
1108320	1113600	and go on and on because it gets even more complicated, I listened to a few of your podcasts
1113600	1120720	and you also talked already about the aerosol forcing basically, and it's important for climate
1120720	1126480	change, and that actually also plays a role for the amok because a lot of the aerosols right now
1127040	1132480	where they are basically are located in the atmosphere, it's cooling regions that could also
1132480	1138400	be critical for the amok and help in that sense, kind of and basically be good for the amok in
1138400	1143440	terms of it's cooling the regions where the deep water formation is taking place, and that might
1143440	1148640	help the driver of the amok, but that also really depends on where exactly, and this is something
1148640	1153920	that is different from climate model to climate model, which is why it's so difficult for us to
1153920	1159520	really say what is going to happen to the amok. We're going to get into the implications of this,
1159520	1168800	which are potentially quite horrific in the coming century, but as a scientist, and I can
1168800	1175600	tell from your voice, do you ever feel a sense of wonder that teams of humans with technology and
1175600	1180480	computers and observations were able to figure out the things that you're describing today?
1180480	1187600	I mean, it's pretty cool, right, that we can understand the dynamics of the ocean currents
1187600	1191840	and all that. Do you ever feel like, wow, this is amazing?
1192640	1198240	When I take the time and take a step back, I guess from what I'm doing, because I mean, in my
1198240	1204720	day-to-day work, I'm more concentrated on what we do not know and what we haven't figured out yet,
1204720	1211680	and from that point of view, it's also a little bit frustrating because we know that the amok
1211680	1216080	is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down.
1216080	1223520	We see from paleo data evidences that it might have happened before, and we are not really
1223520	1229040	much closer to knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing, in terms of how much
1229040	1233760	degree of global warming would be okay before the amok could collapse than we were like 20,
1233760	1239280	30 years ago, even though we know much more. But basically, in discovering more, we also
1239280	1244000	discovered that there are more uncertainties and more things we do not understand, and that
1244000	1247120	all in all led to the thing that we are still pretty uncertain.
1247680	1253920	Let me give you three scenarios, and you can speculate knowing, like you just said, we don't
1253920	1260320	know, but you're very knowledgeable on this topic. The first scenario is that the amok slows around
1260320	1268480	15% and stays there, kind of like it's doing now. The second scenario is that it continues to slow
1269920	1276320	another 50% or something like that. The third scenario is that the amok actually stops
1277440	1283440	in the coming 100 years or 200 years or something like that. Under those three scenarios, what would
1283440	1290640	be some of the effects that the world could experience, or Europe and the North Atlantic
1291280	1298480	coast in the USA and Canada? Can you just paint a picture of what the future might look like under
1298480	1305280	these three scenarios? Sure. Maybe just as a feedback question, what kind of climate change
1305280	1310880	scenario otherwise are we looking at? Basically, because that again is very important, are we
1310880	1315760	looking at a global warming world, or are we saying, okay, we keep this level of global warming
1315760	1326480	plus an amok slowdown collapse? Right. This podcast, we talk about neuroscience and debt
1326720	1334800	biodiversity and climate and economics. Every one of those is unbelievably complex, and yet,
1334800	1340640	and this is what we're trying to do. What you're saying is that let's keep everything
1340640	1346400	constant with climate the way it is right now today. If we were able to do that, which of course,
1346400	1352000	we're not, this is just a thought experiment, then the amok would exhibit under those three
1352000	1358480	scenarios. I said it would have certain effects, or you could look at it as what is the, at two
1358480	1366080	degrees above pre-industrial Celsius, what would do the amok? They're moving in tandem.
1366640	1374560	Let's just say that two to two and a half degrees Celsius in the three scenarios I told you.
1375520	1382240	Yeah, so basically, if the amok stays as it is right now, so basically, it slowed down by about
1382240	1392080	15%, then we would probably, I mean, see what we link to the amok at the moment, which is,
1392080	1396560	I already talked about this global warming signal. You see global warming, or the warming
1396560	1400880	everywhere around the globe, but actually, when you look at the long-term temperature trends,
1400880	1406800	you can see that the mid-center of the North Atlantic cooled over the last century.
1407600	1411520	Of course, this is not true for every single year. I mean, right now, we are having extreme
1411520	1416240	warm sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, but the long-term trend for that region
1416240	1421760	actually has a slight cooling signal, which is unique seen globally. And that is something
1421760	1427520	that we link to the decrease in amok strength and the decrease of heat being transported.
1427520	1432160	So the amok normally transports heat into that region, as the amok slows down,
1432160	1437760	less heat is being transported into that region, which is why we can see a global cooling signal,
1437760	1444800	a local cooling signal in that region, despite global warming. This is now making it more
1444800	1454560	complicated, because when we change the local rate of warming, basically, if that is different
1454560	1460800	from one place to another, then this has an effect on the atmosphere in terms of when we look at
1461520	1467600	the changes in sea surface temperatures pattern. So that's what the amok is doing. It's kind of
1467600	1474080	heating some of the ocean surfaces and cooling others by transporting heat. And this then is
1474080	1479920	being translated to the atmosphere by either warming or cooling the air there. And this then
1479920	1485520	leads, for example, when we have strong amok, we have a heating, the local air above that region
1485520	1491680	rises, we have a low pressure system above that surface region, a higher pressure system in the
1491680	1497200	air, or up higher up in the air. And what I'm trying to say, I'm probably doing a very complicated
1497200	1501760	job in doing is, is that we have an effect on weather systems. And what has been shown for
1501760	1509200	the amok is basically that a slower amok can actually lead to heat extremes over Europe in
1509200	1516080	the summertime by influencing the state and location of the jet stream and the weather systems
1516080	1524240	that are moving with that. So you're saying that the ocean current dynamics of the amok would
1524240	1531120	create a cool blob in the North Atlantic. And because of the jet stream and the pressures
1531840	1535920	that that actually could cause a heat wave in continental Europe.
1536080	1544800	Yes, exactly. Because it's determining how the jet stream is located. And that then determines
1544800	1549920	whether the air that is coming towards Europe is either coming from polar regions or whether it's
1549920	1556320	coming from the African continent. And in that case, this would actually favor an air pressure
1556320	1562960	distribution where we have more air coming from the South towards Europe, so hotter air and therefore
1562960	1570480	can lead to heat extremes. Okay, so carry on with my speculative question. What would be
1571200	1577680	some of the effects if under these three scenarios, and you can tell me what climate
1577680	1583600	scenario you would like to choose. I just want to isolate as much as possible. Of course,
1583600	1588320	we're part of a complex adaptive system, so we can't just talk about the amok without the other
1588320	1595760	things. But I don't think many people understand the risk associated with just this one ocean issue.
1595760	1604000	So maybe you could explain under a not too bad, bad and horrible scenario what some of the impacts
1604000	1610160	would be. Yes, I think maybe I'm talking mainly about the impacts. And with most of them, I think
1610160	1616640	the risk is just going to be higher under a stronger amok slowdown scenario. Maybe it's a
1616640	1621600	little bit different for a complete collapse of the amok. So what we know what the amok is important
1621600	1627120	for, I said it's important for the heat transport. It's also important actually for getting heat from
1627120	1631920	the atmosphere, extracting that and getting it into the deeper ocean. So in a way, it's also
1631920	1637600	important for cooling the atmosphere. We know right now that, and I guess maybe some of you have
1637600	1643920	heard that, the ocean is taking up about 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming.
1644560	1652800	And how does that happen? Yeah, basically, it's kind of a simple loss of thermodynamics and physics
1654080	1657360	and I guess you know that. I mean, if you have two systems of different temperature,
1658080	1663120	then you will have a transport of heat from the hotter to the colder system. That's basically
1663120	1669040	why we get cold when we go outside in the winter time. And I think it might be also
1669040	1675280	then important to know that this effect is stronger with water. Maybe you know when you are
1675280	1682240	out in 25 degrees air, it's a warm summertime. If you stay in water that's 25 degrees Celsius for
1682240	1687920	a longer time, you will actually get chilly because the heat capacity of water is four times
1687920	1693680	larger than that of air. Basically, it can take up heat easier, but it's also conducting the heat
1693680	1701840	faster away from you. And what's happening really is we heat the atmosphere and the ocean below that
1701840	1708400	is colder. They're not in equilibrium and normally systems will always tend towards going into an
1708400	1713280	equilibrium. And because of that, we have a heat flux from the atmosphere to the ocean. Now the
1713280	1720960	thing is, it's really, the ocean is vast. So the mass of the ocean is, even though of course it's
1720960	1727520	in terms of depth, it's up to 11 kilometers. So that's not as deep as the atmosphere is going in
1727520	1734880	height, but because the air gets thinner as we go up into the air, the mass of the oceans actually
1734880	1740000	more than 100 times larger than that of the air and the atmosphere. So the ocean really has way
1740000	1749440	more capacity for taking up additional heat. So the good news is that our planet has these deep
1749440	1760320	and cold oceans that have buffered the effects of heat from our greenhouse gas trapping activities.
1760320	1765440	The bad news is, is they've done this largely invisibly without being recognized and we've
1765440	1773040	taken this buffer for granted. And what an amazing thing that these oceans are so potent,
1773040	1779520	but they've kind of blinded and caused a delay in our ecological impacts, yes?
1780240	1788080	Yes, that exactly. And it's basically a problem that is emerging right now, because you probably
1788080	1793520	know the problems that we see with coral reefs and the bleaching effect. I mean, and that is also
1793520	1798400	due to ocean acidification, but it's mainly due to marine heat waves. And this is something we're
1798400	1804400	seeing now more and more as we're heating up the ocean. And also, it might lead to us taking for
1804400	1809920	granted that the ocean can take up this much heat and, by the way, also carbon. But that is not
1809920	1816000	necessarily the case. I mean, as I said, systems tend to want an equilibrium. So if we put more
1816000	1821600	heat carbon into the atmosphere, the ocean will take up more. But the pace of how fast the ocean
1821600	1826880	can do that depends on how strong the ocean is stratified and how much deep water formation
1826880	1832720	also we have. So basically, the deep water formation kind of acts as a link between the upper
1832720	1838560	ocean and the deep ocean. And if we don't have that anymore, then the upper ocean takes up heat
1838560	1845200	and carbon, but it's fairly full soon, basically, because it's a thin layer. And it really only
1845200	1850080	triggers very slowly to the deep ocean. And therefore, there will be like a delay time
1850080	1855120	when we have the deep ocean connected to the upper ocean via deep water formation,
1855120	1860400	then we can take up or the ocean can take up the heat and carbon much faster. And that's important,
1860400	1867360	but that might actually be hindered in the future by the effect itself, by the increased
1867360	1873360	stratification because of warming the ocean. And yeah. Yeah, so many questions, Lefka.
1875600	1880480	We're talking about the Amock in the Atlantic Ocean. But presumably, there are currents in
1880560	1884160	all the other oceans as well that we're just talking about the Atlantic one, right?
1885200	1895280	Yes. Yeah. And in the past, I've had on a friend of mine, Peter Ward, who's a paleobiologist who's
1895280	1901440	written books, one book called Under a Green Sky, which was about a historical
1902080	1909600	period called a Canfield Ocean where they became stratified and produced hydrogen sulfide gas.
1909600	1916880	And there was no exchange between the different layers. What are the possibilities of that
1916880	1923040	happening? And what are your thoughts on that? Well, I mean, in principle, it's never completely
1923040	1929680	going to happen, right? I mean, even if you have like a very stratified ocean, if you keep warming
1929680	1934640	the atmosphere and with that the upper ocean, there will always be a little bit of mixing
1934640	1940160	and diffusion basically, and the heat is going to travel downwards. But normally,
1940160	1945920	and this is why the Amock is so important, as I said, that's a place where we have a lot of mixing
1945920	1953200	with from the surface ocean with a deeper ocean. And it's basically the difference in I put a drop
1953200	1959520	of color, let's say into a water glass or a water bottle. If I wait a very long time,
1959520	1964240	it's going to mix perfectly, but I would have to wait a very long time. If I take the bottle
1964240	1970000	and shake it, I can do it within a second. And the effect is not as big with the Amock,
1970000	1974400	because it is a local effect, but it's still a deep region or a large region in the North
1974400	1980320	Atlantic where we have a mixing between upper and lower or deeper ocean. And that's why it's so
1980320	1986320	important. And the same is kind of happening, as I said, with carbon. So also the carbon uptake
1986320	1991600	of the ocean is again, it's the same principle. We have an equilibrium between the carbon pressure
1991600	1996560	in the atmosphere and the one in the ocean. We put right now more in the atmosphere,
1997200	2002080	the ocean is taking it up. And the speed depends on the rate of mixing in the ocean.
2002880	2010800	Okay, so the oceans have taken up approximately 90% of the additional heat
2012320	2017440	in the atmosphere and approximately 50% of the carbon, something like that?
2018320	2022560	Yeah, I think it's a little bit more. I'm not completely sure about the number,
2022560	2024480	but I think it's more like two thirds of the carbon.
2025040	2033360	Okay, so can this continue indefinitely at this pace? I assume the answer is no.
2036880	2043040	What is the mechanism that reduces the ability of oceans to absorb heat and carbon?
2043600	2048880	And what happens if they can't absorb anymore? Or what happens if they can't absorb as much?
2049440	2055840	Yeah, so basically, the mechanisms are slightly different. As I said, it really is related to
2057120	2061840	an equilibrium between atmosphere and surface and then the mixing basically between surface
2061840	2071440	ocean and deeper ocean. With carbon, we also have the problem that it's a gas and gases are easier
2071520	2077440	soluble in or you can dissolve them easy on cold water. So as we are warming the ocean,
2077440	2084240	we are actually kind of reducing the capability of the ocean to take up carbon. I mean,
2084240	2089120	as long as we keep pushing more carbon into the atmosphere, the ocean is going to take up more
2089120	2095920	carbon because we increase that pressure. But if that process is slowing down, then we see, of
2095920	2100800	course, also a faster rise in atmospheric carbon concentration because we have to
2102000	2107680	make the pressure even higher from the atmosphere on the ocean for the ocean to keep taking up.
2107680	2112240	And then the problem is, of course, also that this equilibrium is going to change in the future.
2112240	2118000	Let's imagine we stop with our CO2 emissions and we actually manage to stabilize the atmospheric
2118800	2124480	CO2 concentrations and even reduce them. Then at some point, basically, the ocean is going to
2124560	2130400	outgas that additional carbon right now and giving it back to the atmosphere and the same
2130400	2134960	as with the heat. If we start cooling the atmosphere by going into the right direction,
2134960	2140080	basically, because it's what we want, then the ocean who's now acting as a buffer might give
2140080	2146720	that back on long time scale. So it's really also, yeah, has to change how we are treating
2146720	2152400	our solutions and our future pathways by having to consider what we are now changing in the ocean
2152400	2159760	system. So we're going to get our carbon security deposit kicked back to us at the end. So the
2159760	2169440	buffer turns into a boomerang. Once our emissions slow or stabilize, hopefully soon, maybe in 100
2169440	2175520	years or something like that, the oceans are going to then give some of that back at some point.
2176400	2179040	Yes, exactly. And we have to take that into account.
2180000	2185760	Are we taking that into account? That's a very good question. I think in general,
2185760	2192480	of course, we are aware of that. But most climate scenarios that we calculate often,
2192480	2197280	they stop in 2100. As if our world stops in 2100.
2198000	2204720	Exactly. And that's not really an oceanic time scale. Let's put it like that. So I guess often,
2204800	2209520	it's not taken enough into account. So in the earth system timelines,
2210240	2216960	this is something that's important to look at. Yes. Yeah. Okay, so getting back to the three
2216960	2226720	scenarios, just let's just say that we don't do anything to abate our emissions and economic
2226720	2235920	growth is somehow able to continue and EMA continues to slow. What are some of the impacts on
2235920	2242800	Europe and the world under those scenarios? Just as a disclaimer, basically, it's in general kind
2242800	2248960	of complicated to really like single out what is an EMAG effect and what is an effect, basically,
2248960	2256320	of a changing earth system when the EMAG is also changing. Let's assume that they change
2256400	2265040	at the same rate, the rate they're changing now. Yeah. So basically, this knowledge is coming
2265040	2270720	mainly from either paleo data or climate models. So when we basically look at the climate model,
2270720	2276880	then what we see is that when we slow down the AMOG, we have an increase in storm activity
2276880	2282640	and winter storms over Europe in the winter time, which is mainly related basically to
2283520	2288240	changes in the sea surface temperatures pattern in the North Atlantic, which is driving the winds,
2288240	2295920	and that's basically what we can see. We also expect changes in precipitation, mainly over summer,
2295920	2300400	and that really depends on where in Europe you look, but in general, it seems to get a little bit
2300400	2308320	drier with an AMOG slowdown. The explanation is fairly easy in the way that if we put less heat
2308400	2312240	into the North Atlantic, we have less evaporation, and due to the wind system,
2312240	2318160	normally this evaporation is being transported towards Europe. When we look at the US coast,
2318160	2325760	we actually see an increase in sea level rise, and the explanation is actually quite beautiful.
2326320	2330080	I mean, it's not a good thing, but the explanation is beautiful in the way,
2330080	2334800	because I don't know whether many people know that, but when we would look at the ocean surface,
2334800	2340160	it's actually not flat. So basically, when you look from space at the ocean surfaces,
2340160	2347280	you really have hills and bumps and so on, and that is basically because water masses are moved,
2347280	2353520	and we have, due to the rotation of our Earth, we have a constant force. I mean,
2353520	2359520	physically saying, we say Coriolis effect, not force, because it's not in a physical
2359520	2363440	divinitional force, but basically we have something that is moving the water masses
2364400	2368560	if something is moving more northward on the Northern Hemisphere, it's being deflected to the
2368560	2374880	right. And now when we look at the surface currents of the Amock on the Northern Hemisphere,
2374880	2379440	they are moving northward, so water masses are being deflected to the right towards the
2379440	2384560	midst of the North Atlantic, which is when you would look at the North Atlantic. You actually
2384560	2393040	have a water hill in the middle of it, and lower water levels, or basically towards the coast of
2393040	2399200	the US. And that is really linked to the strength of the surface current of the Amock. And if that
2399200	2403680	strength is slowing down, if that current is slowing down, then basically this water hill
2403680	2408640	in the middle of the Atlantic is getting lower, and the sea level at the US east coast is getting up.
2409440	2415360	And again, it's kind of really complicated to say or difficult to say how much exactly that
2415360	2420560	would be. So from climate simulation, it seems like a complete shutdown of the Amock could
2420640	2426400	lead to an additional approximately one meter of sea level rise at the US east coast,
2426400	2430640	but there it also really depends on the city because of complicated dynamics,
2430640	2433040	but that's a link that we know of.
2434480	2439760	And what about the temperatures in Europe, if there's a large slowing or shutdown?
2441200	2449920	Well, if there's a shutdown, it could be locally up to 10 degrees or more, and that depends on,
2449920	2453120	do I look at the annual mean temperature? Hotter or colder?
2453920	2461040	Colder. If the Amock shuts down, then because of this missing heat transport by the Amock
2461040	2465120	towards the northern hemisphere and Europe, it gets colder.
2467760	2472240	So like the movie the day after tomorrow, just not as exaggerated?
2473120	2476960	Not as exaggerated and not as fast, of course. I mean, in the day after tomorrow,
2476960	2482320	everything happens within weeks. And that's something of course, it's also important to stress.
2482320	2489280	We know that the Amock has a tipping point, which means that if we push it too much towards
2489280	2495360	slowing down, there are feedbacks within the system that basically would continue the slowdown
2495360	2501360	process and would lead to an even slower Amock. But this is not happening within days or weeks,
2501360	2506320	but decades. Could you just briefly mention one or two of those such feedbacks?
2507120	2511920	Yes, one is actually, and this is a nice thing, I guess, that we are talking about the same
2511920	2520800	principles. And again, again, the Amock itself is, as I said, it's transporting warm and saline
2520800	2527920	water, surface waters northward. And I said, ocean density is determined by temperature and salinity.
2527920	2533200	So basically, the Amock by transporting salt towards the region where the deep water formation
2533200	2540720	of the Amock is occurring is actually kind of enforcing its own driver. It is making the water
2540720	2546880	denser where it needs it to be dense to keep going. But if the Amock slows down, then we have
2546880	2553680	less salt there. And it's, of course, it's a different effect from adding fresh water to the
2553680	2558800	system. But the result is the same, less salt in the subpoena north Atlantic, where the Amock
2558800	2565120	deep water formation occurs. You are so smart and articulate. And I have to also point out that
2565120	2571840	you were doing this not in your native language. So it's so impressive and important and interesting.
2571840	2577120	So thank you. Thanks for pointing that out. Sometimes I feel a little bit stupid when I say
2577120	2583120	something in English and the world's tumbled out of my mouth. I could never do a scientific climate
2583120	2589600	discussion in English, let alone German, the way that you're doing now. So let me ask you
2589600	2598560	another dumb question. If Amock slows or stops, it could be up to 10 degrees Celsius cooler in Europe.
2598560	2607200	But this is why while at the same time global warming is occurring. So does that mean elsewhere
2607280	2613440	in the world, there's somewhere that has a corresponding heat pump to make the whole
2613440	2616640	thing a little bit net hotter? Or how does that work?
2618080	2625200	Yes. So A, yes. So basically, again, Amock transporting heat from the southern to the
2625200	2630240	northern hemisphere. If the Amock stops, we have more heat access in the southern hemisphere.
2630240	2635360	And that is also what we see in any kind of simulation where we simulate an Amock shutdown
2635360	2643920	is more heating in the southern hemisphere. Exactly where is difficult to say. It's probably,
2643920	2648960	of course, in the North or in the South Atlantic, so in that region, but it kind of seems to spread
2648960	2658400	globally. So this would not be good news for Brazil and Argentina who are already experiencing
2658400	2664640	quite hot temperatures from climate? Exactly. And I would even go so far to say it's also not
2664640	2669920	good news for us, even though we might have a cooling through an Amock slowdown or shutdown.
2669920	2675920	And I mean, we now said, OK, it could be 10 degrees. It really depends on the simulation.
2675920	2680800	But then we would have to add that a shutdown is probably going to occur. Maybe it occurs under
2680800	2684720	five degrees of warming. So you could say, OK, great, we have five degrees of warming,
2684720	2691360	10 degrees of cooling, so maybe a little bit of cooling. But A, this really, it's very local
2691440	2696640	effect. So we don't know exactly where yet. And that is, of course, a very complicated thing,
2696640	2701920	because it also means on how to be prepared for our future. It would be very different under
2701920	2707120	an Amock shutdown than it is under a general global warming scenario with just an Amock slowdown.
2708000	2719280	There are decreasing benefits in an economy to more complexity. There are also decreasing
2720160	2724880	benefits to conversations with average people due to more and more complexity.
2726000	2733040	And this is an incredibly complex topic. But a simplistic understanding is there a risk for
2733040	2742080	trying to get people in Europe aware and engaged and voting and doing things to mitigate
2742960	2750160	more global warming, that if they hear that the Amock is going to slow and that Europe is going
2750160	2760480	to be a lot colder, doesn't that emotionally kind of defer the urgency of climate change at the
2760480	2766800	margin to some people? Have you come across that? I haven't. And I think that's a very interesting
2766880	2775040	thing that I haven't, because I think it shows that people understand enough about the complexity
2775040	2779600	and that basically nobody could guarantee them that it's that they're better off with an Amock
2779600	2784960	collapse. It's that that we tell them it's really something also depends on where in Europe you
2784960	2790240	live. So it's not going to be like a cooling everywhere in Europe, but it will be really
2790240	2794800	centered about the North Atlantic. It's going to change precipitation patterns. And I think
2795680	2801440	looking basically at the last years with flooding events and draws and so on, people know that
2801440	2807280	all these changes in dynamics apart from a simple change in temperature can
2809680	2815040	give so much additional risk or bring so much additional risk that I think a lot of people
2815040	2819920	know no, this is not something one risk, even though there might be a very, very small percentage
2819920	2826080	that's actually going to benefit very few of us. So obviously, you can't distinguish
2826960	2834800	you, Levka, wearing a scientist hat or wearing I'm a human being hat. But if you could just
2835600	2843280	loosely release the scientist hat for a moment, where do you speculate in the distribution of
2843280	2850400	possible futures? What's your gut feel on where we will eventually land in terms of
2851120	2856480	temperature Celsius above pre industrial average? My feeling is we're going to land
2856480	2861200	somewhere where we do not want to be. And that's basically what scares me. I think we're going
2861200	2868400	to land somewhere where we are forced to act because the consequences are so dire and so extreme.
2868480	2874960	And I mean, this is the problem is, of course, I think that the regions globally that are more
2874960	2880160	vulnerable are not the ones where the power and the money sits. And that basically means that
2880720	2886400	we are probably going to see the consequences maybe more in having more refugees and having
2886400	2894320	more war zones and stuff like that. And yeah, it doesn't matter what the number is going to be.
2894320	2900400	I think the reality is not going to be nice. I was just in India in the south of India and most
2900400	2907040	people there don't know about climate science. They just know that it's well, it's 100 degrees
2907040	2913600	there today in the south of India. And it kind of broke my heart because up until that moment,
2914560	2920400	I cognitively knew that there's a billion 400 people in India and the Indian subcontinent is
2920400	2928720	one of those places that it's going to warm and have higher wet bulb issues. But to be there in
2928720	2937600	person and see the real warm, lovely people and culture, it kind of hit me because I visualized
2938480	2945280	some of this happening not centuries from now, but in the coming decades. So I hear what you're
2945280	2953840	saying. So how do you, and we'll get back to this, but I want to still ask you some questions
2953840	2961360	about AMOC. How do you and your colleagues measure AMOC? How can you even measure such a thing?
2962480	2971760	Yeah, that's very complicated actually. So even a few years or a few decades back,
2971760	2976160	I think the first AMOC measurement that I know of, like a real measurement basically where they
2976160	2984160	went into out onto the North Atlantic and put instruments out in the ocean is from 1959. And
2984160	2988800	back then what they had to do is basically they really had to go on a research vessel and then
2989360	2993920	drive along the whole width of the Atlantic, because you really have to go from basically
2993920	3001360	Africa to the US and Brazil basically to really cover the whole length to take into account
3001360	3006640	all of the water masses that are being moved. And that's how it was done for most of the time.
3006640	3013440	And from these first measurements, and that's very costly, it takes a couple of weeks to actually do
3013440	3019600	this. And yeah, just being on a research cruise every single day is, as I said, very expensive
3019600	3025760	and resource extensive. But these first measurements that they made indicated that the AMOC slowed
3025760	3031200	down by quite a bit between 1959 and I think the last measurement was in 2001, where they
3031200	3038640	will really assess that. And the first estimate was the slowdown of 30% over that time. And that
3038640	3045040	was of course a dire news, but it also led to a lot of scientists saying, well, can we really
3045040	3052000	say that? Because this was deduced from five measurements to five research cruises basically,
3052000	3058480	going out there over a course of 40 years. They were done during different times of the years,
3058480	3063680	some were in spring, some were in autumn. And basically what they always gave us was one
3063680	3070880	snapshot of AMOC strength in time. And I mean, basically, if I would try to understand how
3070880	3076480	temperatures are changing, and basically I'm measuring the temperature right now today,
3076480	3081600	and then tomorrow I'm going to measure the one in the morning and then the next time at night,
3081600	3086560	then I know even though I have measurements from three consecutive days, I can't really
3086560	3089920	deduce any trend from them because they're measured in different times of the day. And we
3089920	3095200	know that there's internal variability with a day cycle. And the same is true for the AMOC,
3095200	3100560	but on time scales so that we are not completely aware of yet. So there's not just an annual cycle,
3100560	3106720	but there's an inter-annual cycle. And long story short, that's why they started in 2004
3106720	3112640	to put instruments out into the Atlantic full-time to really have a continuous measurement.
3112640	3118320	It's still very costly, it's a lot of work. So you have to have like researchers getting out there,
3118320	3122720	putting the instrument in, they have to be exchanged every one or two years, they have
3122720	3130720	to be calibrated. But from now, from 2004 on we have AMOC continuous data. The only thing is
3130720	3138000	basically that 2004 until now that's 20 years. When we are looking at climate change, we don't
3138000	3143360	talk just about 20 years. We talk about at least 30 years or longer because we know that there are
3143360	3148640	internal variabilities at place and things can basically happen or you can have a trend over
3148640	3153760	two to three years. That's not a long-term trend, but that's just really related. For example,
3153760	3159120	I guess most people know the El Nino phenomena. All these things have effects on the earth system.
3160720	3168960	So how does the AMOC relate to or does it relate to the Gulf Stream? And is there a risk of the
3168960	3178080	Gulf Stream slowing down? So the AMOC and the Gulf Stream are two interesting partners, brothers,
3178080	3183840	I would say, in the sense of sometimes we even talk or call the AMOC the Gulf Stream system
3184720	3189520	because they are closely linked but they are different. And the important difference is
3190240	3196480	the Gulf Stream is in surface current. It's a wind-driven surface current. Basically, we have
3196480	3201120	wind systems over the North Atlantic. They pushed the water masses due to the Coriolis
3201120	3205920	effects. The water masses are deflected to the right and this basically leads to the Gulf Stream
3205920	3211200	flowing as it does. The Gulf Stream is when we look at the size of the Gulf Stream, it's way
3211200	3216160	bigger than the AMOC. So depending on where you measure, whether it's close to Florida or more
3216160	3223840	towards the inner, outer North Atlantic, the Gulf Stream has a volume transport between 30 to
3223840	3231760	150 swerdrop. And swerdrop is this unit used by physical oceanographers. One swerdrop is a
3231760	3237680	million cubic meters of water that are being transported per second. So Gulf Stream between
3237680	3243360	30 and 150, maybe just as a comparison, the Amazon River, the largest river on earth,
3243360	3250240	has a transport of 0.2 swerdrop. So what's being transported in the Atlantic is huge.
3251520	3257520	But most of the Gulf Stream waters are then basically also end up on the return way as
3257520	3262320	a surface current. And with return way, I mean basically the Gulf Stream is flowing northward
3262320	3267440	and it's then being deflected to the right and to the right due also to the wind system. And we
3267440	3273440	have a southward surface current along the European and African coast basically.
3274720	3278320	We still have a little bit of a heat transport because we have the warm water masses going
3278320	3283600	towards the North Atlantic. They're being cooled and a little bit colder water masses going back.
3283600	3289440	But when we talk about the AMOC, we have an exchange of surface flow going towards the
3289440	3296320	North Atlantic and deep water, really cold flows going southward. So in terms of driveout,
3296320	3301440	for example, you could say the Gulf Stream is driven by the winds. The AMOC is mainly
3301440	3307440	driven by density differences. Mainly I'm saying mainly because when we go out there and measure
3307440	3312640	the AMOC, we can't ask the water masses, hey, what's your driver? Are you moving because of
3312640	3318560	the winds or because of density differences? We just see moving water masses. And yeah,
3318560	3323120	because of that, we would say probably that a small percentage of the Gulf Stream is basically
3323120	3328240	ending up into the deep water formation region and is then becoming part of the AMOC.
3328240	3334800	But the majority of the Gulf Stream is just being also traveling back southward as a surface current.
3334800	3340160	And that part is not slowing down as long as we have the winds. When the AMOC will collapse,
3340160	3344000	then the Gulf Stream would slow down a little bit that AMOC part of the Gulf Stream.
3344560	3349440	And warmer temperatures affect both the Gulf Stream and the AMOC though,
3350320	3355040	because the winds, to my knowledge, are created by the temperature differential
3355040	3361760	between the equator and the poles. And if the poles warm a lot, then that temperature differential
3361760	3370560	declines and that would reduce some of these winds, yes? Yes, that is true. I think although
3370560	3375840	when we measure it right now, the wind effect is really not that large right now. But in principle,
3375840	3381600	you are right that that's happening. This polar amplification is decreasing the temperature,
3381600	3384720	gradient, and with that, the wind strength overall.
3384720	3390320	So in one of the presentations that you have on your website and that you shared with me,
3390320	3396320	you have a slide which we'll put on screen where you highlight that the AMOC effect has
3396320	3405200	potentially just part of a domino effect in some of the other issues dealing with the Amazon and
3405200	3411520	the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. Could you talk about the the feedbacks
3411520	3417360	and the domino effect that relate to not only AMOC but the climate system?
3417360	3422800	So the AMOC, I think, is special in the climate system as it's the one major connector between
3422800	3427600	Tselvarn and Northern Hemisphere between the Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet.
3427600	3433280	And when the AMOC, let's assume the AMOC would slow down by a lot, we kind of said, okay, that
3433280	3438240	means more excess heat in the Southern Hemisphere, less in the Northern Hemisphere, that could, on the
3438240	3443280	one hand side, stabilize the Greenland ice sheet because it's cooling down the sub-Polynorth Atlantic
3443280	3449040	around Greenland and could therefore stabilize that ice sheet. But it would lead to more heat
3449040	3455760	around Antarctica and could therefore, yeah, lead to more melting there and destabilize.
3455760	3460000	When we look at Antarctica, mainly the western part is the one that we are worried about the
3460000	3466560	most right now because it seems to be the most destable one already. And with that, of course,
3467760	3473120	then enhance sea level rise. But, and this is really important, it kind of shows that the order
3473120	3478560	of things happening has an effect. Because if the Greenland, I said a slowdown of the AMOC could
3478560	3483760	stabilize the Greenland ice sheet, if the Greenland ice sheet is tipping, then this would actually
3483760	3489680	lead also to a destabilization of the AMOC. Because if that basically is the order, because
3489680	3494560	we have a lot of freshwater then melted on Greenland and flowing into the sub-Polynorth Atlantic,
3494560	3500240	and I explained already how this can slow down the AMOC. So, yeah, but it shows that the whole
3500240	3506560	Earth system is linked. And when we have those major effects happening, more can follow.
3507120	3512400	You may be too young, and I don't know what TV shows there were in Germany when you were growing
3512400	3517760	up. But do you ever get the feeling that this is all part of some Twilight Zone episode that
3517760	3525280	we're describing this, the biogeochemical cycles of the planet that you and I are alive on.
3525920	3533600	And we're talking about like major Earth system changes happening on our watch. Doesn't that just
3533600	3542480	blow you away at times and not in a good way? Yes, actually, yes. And I think it feels so strange
3542560	3549440	that as humans, I mean, an individual human is very small and in a way, I don't want to insult
3549440	3555200	anybody but insignificant. And for example, when I go out on the North Atlantic on a research
3555200	3562400	vessel and you are out on the ocean, then there's huge water masses, so much power around you,
3562400	3568320	so much energy. And also when we look, I mean, I talked about the volume transport by the AMOC,
3568320	3573360	that's huge, that's nothing we can do basically in terms of engineering. So I had actually people
3573360	3578320	contacted me saying, can't we put some kind of robots into the water and move the AMOC
3578320	3585360	ourselves? No, we can't because that's way too much. That is so huge the system that we can't do
3585360	3592400	that physically. And yet we are actually messing with the system by something as burning coal,
3592400	3600480	by putting CO2 into the atmosphere, so by actually doing, affecting even tinier particles. And it
3600480	3608880	feels very wrong, very scary, I guess, trying to be optimistic. Okay, it shows that we can
3608880	3617520	actually affect the system a lot. But yeah, it feels like we are playing with something and we
3617520	3625840	don't know the rules. And we can talk about this. I'm a science communicator and I know that people
3625840	3632320	that follow this channel are very fluent in these issues, but relative to the general public,
3633040	3641360	the AMOC and ocean risks are relatively unknown, especially in my country. What about in the
3641360	3648400	scientific community? Is there increasing consensus among your colleagues on the AMOC and
3648400	3655840	climate and scenarios going forward? Or is there still quite a bit of disagreement on the broader
3655840	3664000	trends? There's certainly an increased amount of consensus. So when I basically did my PhD and
3664000	3669920	I published my first paper on an AMOC slowdown, there were quite a few scientists who made the
3669920	3677120	point to me that there are other explanations for the signals that we are seeing. And I mean,
3677120	3684000	the difficulty here is, I mentioned the real like direct ABIC measurements continue started in 2004.
3684000	3689520	So to know what happened over the last century, we have to look at what we call proxy data.
3689520	3696320	So other climate variables that we can measure that we know are related to the AMOC and then kind
3696320	3702000	of deduce the AMOC evolution from them. And I worked with my PhD supervisor Stefan Ramstof on
3702000	3707440	looking at the sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. And there are a lot of reasons
3707440	3712080	why we know that they're linked to the AMOC. But of course, they are also influenced by other
3712080	3715680	things. For example, an increase in wind strength could cool the North Atlantic
3716480	3722480	as would an AMOC slowdown. And while there was no one in the scientific community who said,
3722560	3728800	you must be wrong because of that, there were a lot of people saying, well, but it could also be
3728800	3733200	a change in the wind system. We don't know that yet. We don't have the data to support that.
3733200	3739120	But you can't be 100% sure. And I mean, that's true. I would say in all of climate scientists,
3739120	3744640	we basically are never 100% sure because that's not how science works. We basically,
3744640	3749920	we make an assumption, we look at the data and we try to explain all the data that we have,
3749920	3755520	according to that assumptions. And if we find something that is basically disproving what
3755520	3761360	we thought first, then we have to find a new assumption. This has changed because there
3761360	3766080	have been more and more publications that indicated an AMOC slowdown and none that showed
3766080	3771120	the opposite. There's still some data where we are, okay, this is interesting. We can't completely
3771120	3779120	complain that yet. But with that, the consensus is definitely increasing. I think one problem
3779120	3785920	is also just the way the science community works as a whole. So it's not that there's one publication
3785920	3790320	about something and everybody's, oh yeah, now we're going to believe that. It's more like, oh,
3790320	3796400	interesting. Now let's wait a little bit, see what other research groups are publishing on that,
3796400	3802000	test that. I mean, that's good. That's how we can make sure that we are not basically following
3802000	3807360	some random group, but that we're really getting to enhance our knowledge. But it also makes a little
3807360	3814400	bit slow and maybe with regards to climate change too slow. It's so complex. And I'm sure you deal
3814400	3825280	with ocean AMOC experts in your paper writing and your job. But then there's Arctic climate
3825280	3834320	specialists and cloud physicists. And there's all sorts of different disciplines within the
3834320	3840000	climate discipline itself. And how do you all meet at conferences and compare notes on things
3840000	3845760	that you're not experts in that someone else is? What's your experience there?
3846640	3854720	My experience is that the different disciplines are too siloed, basically, so then don't talk
3854720	3861120	enough to each other. And I think it's not just a problem with within the disciplines, but also
3861120	3867360	with the way science is being done at the moment, that it's really pressed towards publications.
3867360	3872080	As a young researcher, I know basically I'm being measured by the amount of first author and second
3872080	3877120	author publications that they have. Because of that, too many papers are being published and no
3877120	3882480	one can read all of that. But to publish a paper, you have to find something new. And I think what
3882480	3888400	we really have to do more is actually synthesizing the data that is out there, the publications
3888480	3898480	that are out there. Yeah. So tell me about your work. Where do you work? What do you do? And if
3898480	3905600	you and your team are successful, what do you hope to accomplish? Yeah, here I have to admit that
3905600	3913360	basically, I kind of left the AMO community, the very small AMO, not small, but the focused AMO
3913360	3917920	community. Because of the experience I made in the last years, that basically,
3919120	3925040	the AMO is a topic that is able to raise attention, maybe also because of this movie,
3925040	3929360	The Day After Tomorrow, and at least in Europe, a lot of people know about the Go stream and the
3929360	3936480	importance. But there are so many things happening when we look at the increase in extreme weather
3936480	3945280	events, when we look at flooding. And I feel that the increase in fires, so many things related
3945280	3951600	to climate change that happen on a way faster time scales than the AMO and that have a big
3951600	3958160	effect right now, that I basically went to my former institute, the Potsam Institute for Climate
3958160	3962960	Impact Research, and now work with Johann Rockström on the planetary boundary framework,
3962960	3968000	which is highlighting actually this global approach and the synthesizing approach, saying
3968000	3974160	it's not enough to just look at one special corner or area. And I mean, this is actually going
3974160	3979760	further, saying, okay, not just AMO is enough, not even just climate change is enough to really
3979760	3985760	have to look at the earth system, and looking at all its components, looking at the biosphere
3985760	3990560	integrity and basically how the biosphere is right now functioning in our favor, because that is
3990560	3996720	also taking up a lot of carbon, how it's basically working in terms of the radiation budget. And I
3996720	4004480	just feel that we know so much that we can do that would improve the lives of so many people on earth
4004480	4010800	in terms of, of course, reducing CO2, but also living more sustainable, changing our diets
4010800	4017760	towards more plant based, that I just wanted to work on that. And I think the problem is in getting
4017760	4024400	people to act that most want numbers and certainty, and we can't give 100% certainty yet, and we can't
4024400	4031680	give like the exact numbers, but we can give with 99% 0.9 certainty the direction that we have to go.
4031680	4035200	And I just want to press that and work on the science there.
4036240	4044800	This is an interesting thing, because if we stop this conversation now, you have outlined
4044800	4053200	scientifically, credibly, in some detail how the AMOC works, and my viewers will have learned about
4053200	4058560	that. There's a wide variety of viewers that follow this channel, because we cover all the
4058560	4065440	aspects of the human predicament. But once we go into what should we do about it, I'm sure you have
4065440	4074320	some suggestions, then once we talk about prescriptions, then some people no longer believe
4074880	4080160	the scientific description. And I'm not talking about you, I'm just talking about generally in
4080160	4086160	the world, there is the explanation of the issue, and there's the what to do about it,
4086160	4089440	and they confound each other. Have you experienced that?
4090080	4098080	Yes. And I mean, I'm not 100% surprised by it, because it often seems to be human nature,
4098080	4105680	right, that we find it really difficult to change. And I mean, when I look, we look at our everyday
4105680	4110160	lives, I guess most people know basically what would be best for their own health in terms of
4110160	4116400	exercise, diet, and so on. But they seem to be not to be able to do what's best for them in the
4116400	4121600	long term. I guess short term, I can basically say, okay, I want to eat this right now. So I do
4121600	4127520	it because it makes me happy. And so it's not surprising that when it comes to this even bigger
4127520	4133440	and more longer term issue, that of course, we are not able to choose what's best for us in the
4133440	4141920	long term. But it's also really, really frustrating. I think if 10 or 20 or 30% of people chose the
4141920	4149120	better path for climate, there would be a social primate pressure to do that. But since it's
4149760	4155760	someone else's problem, and in the future so far, we have not, we've not done that. Plus, we are
4157120	4163040	individual humans as part of this globally connected emergent energy, hungry,
4163360	4174000	pseudo organism that has a life of its own. So climate is a real problem for this situation. And
4174000	4182080	the only antidote that I can think of is more conversations like this that act as a facilitator
4182080	4186960	between our current behaviors and our mental understanding of the future.
4187600	4194400	I agree. I think that the best way still to basically facility or induce change is to explain
4194400	4200080	things, to understand things. Because if it's difficult to change, then we will only change
4200080	4205520	if we really get the reason. So earlier you said, and I happen to agree with you,
4207120	4214720	that we're going to do business as usual, make a few little benign tweaks on the margins,
4214800	4226320	but not do anything major until we see the temperature, precipitation, ecological impacts
4226880	4230320	are horrifying. And then we're going to try to do something radical
4231840	4237520	at the last minute. Do you have any speculation on what some of those radical interventions might be?
4237520	4246080	Oh, I don't know yet, because I guess it's kind of like a path I don't really want to go down in
4246080	4251280	my mind. I mean, the thing is, of course, that there are, as far as I know, they're not like real
4251280	4256640	international laws on what kind of climate or geoengineering is allowed or not. So I'm afraid
4256640	4260560	that some people might be thinking, oh, cool, now we put a lot of air results into the atmosphere
4260560	4267680	because that at least has a cooling effect for a few years. I know that I think, I mean,
4267680	4274560	those ideas have been tested in climate models and basically run through and none of them
4275360	4281200	seems to be promising for the moment. So I would say that anything radical that we do is probably
4281200	4289840	not going to be wise. So could you offer any non radical suggestions to our viewers,
4289840	4298320	either as individuals or as parts of institutions that create policies? And, you know, my view is
4299120	4308480	Germany or the United States can't just be climate friendly policies and go to the Paris Accord
4308480	4314640	agreements. It's a global, you know, the CO2 is not recognized national borders. I mean,
4314640	4323760	it's a global thing. So what sort of recommendations do you have to avert some of the
4324960	4329520	default paths that we're currently on with the AMOC and with the global climate system?
4329520	4334800	I mean, in principle, it is very simple. First of all, we really have to get our CO2 emissions
4334800	4340640	down. And I think personally, that means on the one hand side, I would really encourage people to
4341600	4348000	basically look at the political party that they support. And this topic should be in there. And
4348000	4353280	I mean, I'm not basically, for me, it's not really important whether otherwise what kind of
4353280	4359200	faction you support and whether you like our fan of capitalism or free markets or whatever,
4359200	4364560	the climate topic should be in there no matter what the party is, because that's non-negotiable.
4364560	4370240	And that's nothing we can basically, we can't talk to the climate system or to the earth system and
4370240	4374800	say, Hey, now we're going to pay you this amount of money and you're not going to change. So that's
4374800	4379920	important. And please stress that no matter what you otherwise basically stand for believe in.
4380480	4387520	And then the other thing is also be skeptical, I think, because we like easy solutions. But
4387520	4392560	normally the easy solutions is not the best solution. And I think that's just something
4392560	4397280	most of us know, right? If we work hard for something, normally it stays longer,
4397280	4402400	basically what I gain in a minute, I can often lose very soon also, what I gain with hard work
4402400	4408880	over years, that stays. And I think so with that, be okay with that, it's going to be hard, but it's
4408880	4414080	not going to be negative. A lot of the decisions or changes that we have to make, as I already mentioned,
4414080	4419760	would also be good for ourselves. I mean, we do know that a plant based diet is better for most
4419760	4425760	of our health. And that basically cycling a lot. I mean, who wants to sit in a car all day and drive
4425760	4431200	around? Maybe a few people do, but and that's okay too. I think kind of try to find the changes
4431200	4438560	that are okay with you. Nobody has to change their life completely. But we can all make changes that
4438560	4445040	basically make our lives more sustainable. And I think that's also important to like really
4445040	4450800	take care of that and do the effort and don't do it for somebody else, but basically do it
4450800	4457280	because it's the right thing to do. That makes sense. It does make sense. But as I said, climate
4457280	4465040	is a global issue and we've got India planning to double coal production in their country by the
4465040	4469760	year 2030. And you can understand why they want to do that because they're going to have higher
4469760	4476240	temperatures and they need more air conditioning and cooling for their population. So there is
4476320	4481360	individual recommendations and I agree with the ones that you laid out, but there's got to be some
4481360	4490720	sort of global plan and there isn't and I know why there isn't. So is there any hope in the
4490720	4497120	international scope of things that you and your colleagues have? I think these COP meetings so
4497120	4505600	far have been a real disappointment. They have no teeth. And I think the difficult questions are not
4506240	4511680	askable with all these high status men and women from around the world because they don't like
4512800	4519440	truth to power sort of questions. Yeah, that's a very good question. And I have to say basically
4519440	4527840	there's a reason why I'm not in policy because I like honesty and I like being direct and I can't
4528960	4534320	deal with people who try to tell me something by I don't know going around the issue and telling me
4534320	4540720	something else. And with that I'm also very frustrated and I think honestly that this
4541600	4547040	lying on a like lying on that level on an international level and with lying I'm also
4547040	4553280	meaning that if you like draw attention away from the truth or you hide some fact that should be
4553280	4559280	really punishable I think because it is misleading and it's hurting so many people. I'm also hopeful
4559280	4566240	because I've actually met a few people that are active in policy and that have great ideas and that
4566240	4572880	are really really enthusiastic and engaged in trying to protect others those who can't protect
4572880	4578640	themselves. But of course I do see that we are not really getting closer to a solution right now
4578640	4584960	and I honestly don't know how to change that how to help that. I think we if there are people out
4584960	4590000	there who know that their strength is to influence other people basically and to get them to basically
4590000	4595200	do what you want them to do then please use it for good that's what I'm asking you. I can only
4595200	4600000	give you the facts but we see that delivering the facts is not enough right that's what we've seen
4600000	4606720	that that's not enough we kind of need some kind of climate lobby where we really say hey people
4606720	4613840	this is what you have to do. Maybe we need effectivists instead of activists. So let me let me ask
4613840	4621200	you a personal question. You're obviously very knowledgeable and passionate about this topic
4621200	4626720	as you should be because this is the topic of our times well one of the the core ones anyways.
4627840	4636480	How do you manage being all in as you clearly are on ocean issues planetary boundaries where
4636480	4643920	we're headed and then have a normal life and have a cheeseburger or strudel or whatever whatever
4643920	4649680	you eat there with your high school friends and and your family how do you live in both worlds
4649680	4659040	because I struggle to be honest in in in my life with with that. Yeah I do too and I guess I mean
4659040	4663840	I'm not completely sure what I'm leading a normal life compared to everyone else. I would say that
4663840	4670240	when I look among my amongst my friends most of them basically support the same things I support
4670240	4675040	so I'm really living in a little bit of a bubble and most of them really try to be as sustainable
4675040	4679520	as possible. I think it would be difficult otherwise it's something that I do see with
4679520	4684880	family with I mean you don't choose your family right you are born into it and there I'm having
4684880	4691360	sometimes complicated or complicated discussions and sometimes I just yeah decide not to discuss
4691360	4698320	certain things and in other terms I mean I have to admit say that this kind of is also affecting
4698320	4704560	basically how I plan my life and I do see that basically I would say the goals and dreams that
4704560	4710640	my parents have given me and kind of saying hey when you are I'm 34 right now so I should probably
4710640	4718000	have two kids a husband and a house and basically I have a partner fiance I'm very happy with but
4718960	4725760	we never plan on getting a house because that's not really I think realistic achievable for most
4725760	4730400	people so I guess that of course but some people can have their own house in their own place but
4730400	4735840	when we look at the number of people we have on the planet our limited resources then not everyone
4735840	4741360	can have a house actually most people can't have their own house and it's also really when we think
4741360	4746640	about okay do we want or not have children do I want to put my children into this kind of world
4746640	4752320	will I be able to adequately protect them with what's coming in the future these are things
4752320	4757840	I'm discussing with my my partner and with my friends because it's yeah it's not just about
4757840	4763440	what is my own happiness basically and do I give on my genes to the next generation
4764240	4771200	we certainly know that in terms of population we don't need every one of us to get a child
4771200	4778640	so we are enough people on the planet and of course in terms of resources not having a child
4778640	4783280	is way smarter than having one which is not saying that nobody should have children of
4783280	4790160	course if you but it's something that I think is in there I know of those things I know of
4790160	4795680	the limited resources and I can't forget it when I basically enter my private life what I
4795680	4803680	learn or do during my work time so I struggle as you long ago I chose not to have children
4805600	4811120	genetic children you and I both have cultural children in a way with the young people that we
4811120	4817520	influence with these ideas and I have ducks and and dogs which also eat resources but
4818400	4823840	that's the path I chose so let me ask you one more scientific question and then I'll get to the
4823840	4829840	closing questions that I ask all my guests would it be fair for me to say that this year
4830720	4838800	will be the coolest year of the rest of my life on average of course there could be El Nino and
4838800	4843840	La Nina and other things but is that a fair assessment to make given what we know about
4843840	4850640	the inertia of the climate system? Sort of I mean you just chose basically an El Nino year which
4850640	4857040	of course we know is a global average a higher temperature so I very much hope that the next
4857040	4862640	two, three, four years will be on average a little bit cooler again but in terms of course
4862640	4870080	of the long-term trends yes so basically I wouldn't see like a large scale cooling signal
4870080	4875120	is not going to happen within the next decades even if we would stop all emissions right now so
4875920	4884400	yeah but yeah thank you that's my understanding as well but I wanted to back it up with a
4884400	4890640	climate scientist and I will have Johan your colleague on in the near future he was supposed
4890640	4900480	to be on tomorrow but we had to we had to reschedule it so Lev K I really I really like you and I
4900480	4908160	respect what you're doing and I feel the the passion and frustration bubbling just under
4908160	4915280	the surface because this isn't our fault what's happening but you and I were born on this planet
4915280	4923680	as humans during this time of the carbon pulse and looking around us and figuring it out is
4923680	4929920	someone's job and I'm glad that you're doing it so do you have any personal advice you just
4929920	4937680	mentioned about houses and children but do you have any personal advice for the listeners of this
4937680	4944080	show that are hearing what you're saying and concerned about the future what what sort of advice
4944080	4950480	do you have for the listeners I would say on the one hand side kind of be creative in your dream
4951200	4957120	I kind of mentioned that we don't have to have the same goals in terms of having or becoming rich
4957120	4964320	having our own house or having to basically fly have a vacation somewhere fancy tropical every year
4965120	4968320	because that's what doesn't tell you what makes you happy so really like listen
4969200	4974320	in your inner self basically what really does make you happy because I think most of the stuff
4974320	4980720	that makes you happy can be very sustainable and totally fine and be done within the earth resources
4981440	4989680	but then the other thing is I still believe and try to act under the assumption that humans are
4989680	4995840	good and that nobody really wants to be a bad person or tries to harm others I mean there might
4995840	5002560	be a few exceptions but I think most people even if they actually do something right now that is
5002560	5008240	causing a lot of emissions and harm to the environment they have a reason that can probably
5008320	5014080	be understood by us because there is a reason in their reasoning why they're doing this and why
5014080	5019360	it's a good thing to do and so it would be good of course we have to educate those people and we
5019360	5026960	have to try to change them but we shouldn't like make them to monsters and we should act in the way
5026960	5034400	saying hey okay I see what you're doing this is how it's like this how why I don't like what you're
5034400	5039280	doing because it's hurting this and this person can you explain to me why we're doing it and maybe
5039280	5045600	we can find a solution together so I think that's important to also just stay optimistic and to like
5045600	5051920	life and also because I really believe it's true so most people I talk to when they do something
5051920	5057200	like how can you do that then they explain it to me I'm like oh okay and now it makes sense but hey
5057200	5061360	there's actually a different way of how you can do this which is way better for the environment
5061360	5066720	and for everyone and how would you change that advice for the young people watching the show
5066720	5072160	and their teens or 20s who are becoming aware of all this and they have a whole lifetime ahead of them
5073840	5082000	that's a very good question and I would say I'm not completely sure what I would say I would
5082000	5089600	probably apologize for not for not having taken better care of their world so far I mean and I'm
5089600	5097120	still fairly young I would try to I would say be bold basically just because you're young and it
5097120	5102480	feels like you might know less and that's something I experience as actually as a scientist so I mean
5102480	5108720	I'm talking to colleagues who have 20 or more years experience than I have in the topic and sometimes
5108720	5114080	still they I see that they make mistakes and it just takes me more longer to be brave about that
5114080	5120640	and say hey no I'm studying this too and you might have more experience but I put a lot of time in
5120640	5125760	this and I know I'm right and I think that's also what the young people is when you feel something
5125760	5135440	is not right be brave about it be bold about it and change and otherwise probably also be hopeful
5135440	5141920	find your own future but in general I have to say it does it's hard for me it's hard for me to be
5142000	5147600	like completely optimistic towards a person who has I don't know 70 80 year ahead of them because
5147600	5152640	I know that life is going to change quite a bit during that time so this is a question I ask all
5152640	5160880	my guests and I think you may have subliminally through your things that you've left unsaid have
5160880	5167280	given the answer but what do you care most about in the world Lefke it's probably a fair and honest
5167280	5176800	world so I think that this is what bugs me most about I guess this topic is that the main people
5176800	5184320	who are causing the problems are not the ones that are suffering the most and that's just not
5184320	5192640	what I like so it's really the fairness and the main non-humans are going to suffer as well
5193520	5200640	that's a very good point yes yeah so if you could wave a magic wand what is one thing you might do
5200640	5205280	to change human and planetary futures if there was no personal risk to yourself
5206960	5212720	kind of depends on on the limit I mean if I could basically change the climate system the earth system
5212720	5219120	back to a pre-industrial state and fix it in that way that no matter what we do we we couldn't
5219120	5225360	change it as humans that would of course be a safe way although maybe we wouldn't then learn
5225360	5230960	I think if it comes to the human mind as I said I would really like us to be able to make the
5230960	5237120	advice's decision to be objective look at the facts and then decide what we do based on them
5237120	5245680	and what we want to happen and not based on this weird mix of emotion fear maybe favors
5246640	5253520	yeah so that I think would already bring us a very big step further towards a sustainable future
5255120	5262640	thank you if I were to have you back on the show which I would love to what is one topic
5263280	5270480	in your broader work that isn't a broad overview but is a very specific topic that you think is
5270560	5275200	relevant to our future that you would be willing to talk about in depth
5276720	5284000	the next time well given my my location better my job right now it would really be about the link
5284000	5291040	of the climate system towards the rest of the earth system towards with the land system with
5291840	5298480	species diversity and how all of this is basically connected but from a scientific point of view so
5298480	5304320	not from a like spherical point of view mother earth but really we see so much scientific evidence
5304320	5310480	for that and I would love to talk about that excellent any closing words for our viewers
5310480	5315920	and listeners lefka I guess honestly if they listened until this point then I would thank them
5315920	5323600	for being so interested in the science because yeah I know it's a complicated topic and I
