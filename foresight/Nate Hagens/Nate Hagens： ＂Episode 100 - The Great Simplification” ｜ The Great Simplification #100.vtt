00:00.000 --> 00:29.000
Greetings. Welcome to episode 100. What? 100 episodes. This time flew by. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding thing I have ever done hosting this podcast, challenging because we're covering a lot of issues, not just one. And invariably these issues infringe on people's understanding or belief or ideology.

00:30.000 --> 00:46.000
And it's difficult to host a multi-topic podcast. Rewarding because I feel less alone, I feel motivated by the hundreds of thousands of humans around the world that are wanting to learn more about this story.

00:46.000 --> 01:07.000
And that ultimately is the work, is we're trying to help more people normalize conversations about how everything fits together in a system science sense. It is threatening, it is daunting, it is scary, some of the information that we're presenting.

01:07.000 --> 01:20.000
But I'm not selling fear. I'm trying to sell understanding. Actually, I'm not trying to sell anything at all. All of our content is free. We've turned all monetization off on social media.

01:21.000 --> 01:36.000
We, of course, would accept and do need donations, tax deductible to the Institute for the Study of Energy in our Future. But it is my belief that anyone in the world that has internet could access this for free.

01:37.000 --> 01:54.000
There's a lot planned going forward. I do want to have more podcasts dealing with responses as opposed to just the problems. As things get more threatening, I'm hoping that I don't fly too close to the sun and get burned.

01:54.000 --> 02:12.000
But I'm all in on passing the baton to more humans working on this. I have asked for Episode 100, a friend of mine who works in a related space, to interview me. Without further ado, here is Episode 100 of the Great Simplification.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
Today's guest is Nate Hagins.

02:16.000 --> 02:30.000
Nate is the director of the Institute for the Study of Energy in our Future, an organization that works with many others to assemble roadmaps and off-ramps for how human societies can adapt to lower throughput lifestyles.

02:30.000 --> 02:38.000
Nate holds a master's degree in finance from the University of Chicago and a PhD in natural resources from the University of Vermont.

02:38.000 --> 02:52.000
He also happens to be the host of this podcast, The Great Simplification, except not today, because we are turning the tables and I am interviewing him. So please welcome Nate Hagins.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
Hi, Nate. Great to see you.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Hey, Kate. Thank you so much for being here.

03:08.000 --> 03:18.000
Well, it's a big pleasure and this is the 100th episode of the podcast and I'm very honored that you asked me to turn the tables and interview you.

03:18.000 --> 03:31.000
And I just want to say that I think you very generously create this space and interview many people and give them space to put out their view, their knowledge, their experience of the world. So it's my pleasure to do that in reverse for you.

03:32.000 --> 03:53.000
Yeah, it's not anything I really ever planned on doing and fortunately I have a lot of friends like you that have a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share. So here we are 100 episodes in and thank you for being the hostess.

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
My pleasure. So how are we going to go? I'm going to kick off in a way that you often start.

03:57.000 --> 04:07.000
I'm going to ask you to give me lots of one minute messages, just like the top line of the way you think. And then we can dive in deep to things, okay? You ready?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
I want to share one thing.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Mm-hmm.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Yesterday, my girlfriend's daughter brought me this little screaming goat.

04:16.000 --> 04:24.000
And I'm thinking if there's really difficult questions, because I'm kind of nervous right now on the tables being turned, I might just differ and do the screaming goat.

04:24.000 --> 04:43.000
Because, you know, when I prepare for these podcasts, I've gotten used to it where I do, Lizzie, my curator prepares me for the scientist or whoever it is and gives me an arc of a conversation and I kind of prepare and then I just sit back and I ask you questions, right?

04:43.000 --> 04:46.000
But now you're asking me questions, so I'm a little nervous.

04:46.000 --> 04:55.000
Well, thank you for saying that and thank you for putting yourself in this situation and experiencing from what it's like from the other side. And I think it's going to go well.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
So...

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Let's do it.

04:58.000 --> 05:09.000
Let's do it. So let's jump in. I'm going to ask you just some big concepts that you use regularly in your work. Just give us a one minute summary of that message, okay?

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
Tell me about energy blindness.

05:13.000 --> 05:25.000
Energy blindness is the fact that our society misunderstands energy in its role in our current living and our expectations.

05:25.000 --> 05:34.000
There are four aspects. One is that energy underpins everything in nature and everything in human systems. We need energy for everything.

05:34.000 --> 05:47.000
Number two, that we don't realize the scale of how much energy we use effectively four to five hundred billion human workers equivalent of fossil energy.

05:47.000 --> 06:03.000
The third is that this stuff is depleting very rapidly and culturally we're treating it as if it were interest, but it's actually a principal, a bank account that is being drawn down millions of times faster

06:03.000 --> 06:19.000
than it was built up. And the fourth aspect of energy blindness is that when we burn all this energy to give us the modern conveniences and transport and consumption, there is a pollution and a waste that comes with that.

06:19.000 --> 06:34.000
And I think our cultural stories don't include any of that. And yet so much of our future and our expectations and institutions and culture depend on energy. So we're energy blind.

06:34.000 --> 06:39.000
And I've sometimes heard you say that energy is the currency of life, yes?

06:39.000 --> 06:54.000
Yes, in nature, those organisms and ecosystems that have surplus energy have had advantages. So there's lots of things important in life, but if you don't have energy, you can't move or eat or do anything.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
So energy is the currency of life and it always will be.

06:58.000 --> 07:05.000
I fully agree on that. And so then if energy is the currency of life, tell us about the carbon pulse.

07:05.000 --> 07:21.000
Well, the carbon pulse is began when humans started to discover first coal, then oil, then natural gas and farm under the earth instead of on top of the earth.

07:21.000 --> 07:45.000
And if you look at a 300,000 year aerial view of our species, this little sliver of time where we're drawing down this ancient carbon and propelling our civilization using it can look like a pulse, like an EKG pulse that starts from nothing,

07:45.000 --> 08:01.000
goes to a high amount and then goes back to nothing. And we're all living in the middle of that, probably near the peak of that. And that is another thing that's not included in our cultural conversations is, you know, on a 500 year time

08:01.000 --> 08:21.000
scale, we're a couple hundred years into the carbon pulse and what will the downslope of the carbon pulse look like. So I think this is an ecological deep time framing of the human cultural situation that is so prevalent in our lives, but we

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
don't talk about it.

08:23.000 --> 08:35.000
Okay. And that's exactly what we're going to talk about today. So if we are somewhere near the peak of this carbon pulse, what's the story with the economic super organism? What is that?

08:35.000 --> 08:55.000
So there are super organisms in nature like termite mound or an ant colony where all of the individual organisms collaborate and towards a larger unspoken goal. So the human super organism is not an actual biological entity,

08:55.000 --> 09:15.000
but what it ends up being de facto an economic super organism that humans in this culture self organize as families as small businesses as corporations all the way up to nation states and the whole world to maximize profits.

09:15.000 --> 09:33.000
That is our marching orders by our culture. And those profits are tethered to energy. There's a 99% correlation between GDP, our economic output and energy consumption and 100% correlation to material consumption.

09:34.000 --> 09:54.000
And that energy is over 80% still tethered to fossil carbon. So what we're doing is rushing forward trying to optimize profits and GDP. And we've built all of our institutions and expectations around that without any other plan.

09:54.000 --> 10:16.000
And what's happened is the momentum of that system, the momentum of that way of doing things is stronger than the individual wisdom and restraint that people within it try to imbue on the organism itself.

10:16.000 --> 10:30.000
In other words, we're in a runaway train shoveling more fuel into it and there is no conductor. There's not a politician or a billionaire that can say, wait a minute, this is the wrong objective. We need to change it.

10:30.000 --> 10:46.000
So the super organism is this metabolic system that is out of control and all it wants is more the lowest cost energy and other material things to power growth.

10:47.000 --> 10:54.000
Okay, we're going to come back to this runaway train with no conductor later. What do you mean when you talk about the Mordor economy?

10:55.000 --> 11:07.000
You know, J.R. Tolkien was so prescient in so many things. There's so many one liners from the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit that are so apropos to our current civilization.

11:08.000 --> 11:25.000
So our economy is based on energy, materials and productivity from technology and a lot of our productivity has come from just adding more fossil energy every single year because it's so potent.

11:25.000 --> 11:46.000
So some of our productivity has come from just more energy. And so the Mordor economy is instead of tightening our belts, instead of having ecological civilization, the default is that we will continue to have rule changes

11:46.000 --> 11:57.000
and go and borrow more money and invent technology that might give us some energy, but it takes a lot of energy and materials to create.

11:57.000 --> 12:15.000
And so what will happen is we will grow our gross, our GDP, which is our gross energy, but the amount of energy and materials and environmental impact that that will have will take up an increasing amount of the whole.

12:15.000 --> 12:36.000
So in 1999, we hit a seven century low of how much energy it took to generate GDP for the rest of society. It was around 5%. Now we're over 10%. We're using 10 or more percent of our energy just to get the energy and refine it and deliver it to the rest of society.

12:36.000 --> 13:05.000
As we go higher to 15% or 20%, we gradually become more and more of a mining economy, aka Mordor economy. And as you're well aware, the pollution impacts not only climate but biodiversity and sperm count drop and insect loss and deforestation and all of that will increasingly take a toll on the human system.

13:05.000 --> 13:24.000
And we're going to have to use more energy and materials to remediate what's happening there. So in short, a Mordor economy is currently the default path. And depending on your boundary of analysis, many people could rightly argue the Mordor economy is already here.

13:25.000 --> 13:38.000
But what it basically means is that we optimize growth over ecology and our entire system becomes one of mining and consumption.

13:39.000 --> 13:56.000
And just to go into the stats you just gave there. So you're saying some years ago it was at a low like in a positive way that we were using around 5% of the energy used was to get access to energy and now that's gone up to 10% and you spoke as if that's inevitably going to rise.

13:56.000 --> 14:11.000
I'm sure some people are thinking, but isn't that possible to bring it back down again with new technologies with nuclear fusion or other kinds of breakthroughs in energy technologies that this we could bring it back down there and even lower? What's your view on that?

14:11.000 --> 14:29.000
Yes, well that would be the argument that some are using on artificial intelligence that it will rapidly find new ways of using our resources more efficiently or develop new technologies like nuclear fusion.

14:29.000 --> 14:45.000
And if those are done cheap enough, then you're right, maybe we do go back to a period where 7% of our GDP is energy creation and delivery and refining.

14:45.000 --> 15:05.000
But first of all, that's on the come. That's not the direction we're heading. Second of all, if that were to happen, we would still probably have a growing economy and this gets into the issue of Jebens paradox.

15:05.000 --> 15:29.000
As the economy is growing, more efficiency and better technology doesn't result in lower energy use. It results in higher energy use globally and so the ecology side of the Mordor economy equation would be even more dramatic if that were to happen.

15:29.000 --> 15:50.000
But yeah, there are a lot of things out there that are being developed, but it's the net energy of them that I worry about. And this is one of the, what I've referred to in the past is the tragedy of the energy investing commons is suddenly, especially with Ukraine and Russia and now war in the Middle East.

15:50.000 --> 16:19.000
People are recognizing, holy crap, energy is really important. Let's do this or that technology to get more energy. But the actual energy and materials spent to procure that energy for society ends up being a lot larger than what has been 50 years ago when this whole civilization was kind of built forward on really cheap oil, gas and coal.

16:19.000 --> 16:32.000
Okay. And since you just started mentioning some geopolitics in the world, can you just briefly explain what's meant when you and others in conversation on this podcast have talked about the metacrisis?

16:32.000 --> 16:35.000
I'm suppressing the impulse to ask you what you think.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
No, no, no, no, Nate, we've turned the table.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
No, I know that. I'm just telling you, I'm suppressing the impulse.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.000
Great. Thank you.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
You keep going.

16:43.000 --> 17:06.000
Yeah. Well, the metacrisis, I mean, there's a lot of terms out there, the polycrisis, the metacrisis, I used to say the human predicament. It's when all these things are intertwining and coalescing and in an interconnected way, creating a really large capital letter problem.

17:07.000 --> 17:30.000
There's the environmental crisis, there's the poverty, inequality, global south issues, there's debt, there are biological existential risks from bio weapons and CRISPR and AI and things like that.

17:31.000 --> 17:38.000
Just the ecological planetary boundaries issues alone is a metacrisis unto itself.

17:38.000 --> 17:52.000
And I mean, I'm sure we may talk about this, but one of the things I've learned from doing this podcast is there's so many bright people working on a part of the metacrisis,

17:53.000 --> 18:00.000
but they don't see the other parts because it's too big and they're like experts on their parts.

18:00.000 --> 18:07.000
But any one of these seven crises is huge on its own.

18:07.000 --> 18:16.000
And so that's kind of what I've tried to do is connect how they fit together, but it's a big challenge as you're well aware.

18:16.000 --> 18:21.000
Okay, so I've got two more of these concepts that you often use.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Oh, okay, we're still on the speed round, okay.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Yeah, we're still on the speed round, mate.

18:25.000 --> 18:29.000
Okay, four horsemen, who are these horsemen?

18:29.000 --> 18:34.000
You sometimes talk about the four horsemen I think of the 2020s, so explain.

18:34.000 --> 18:45.000
Yeah, I'm increasingly talking about that because it feels incredibly relevant, more relevant than other topics.

18:45.000 --> 18:57.000
So the four horsemen are briefly financial overshoot, which is when we've had economic problems in the past.

18:57.000 --> 19:08.000
Instead of tightening our belt, we actually do the opposite and we widen the spigot of credit creation and central bank guarantees and stimulus checks.

19:08.000 --> 19:16.000
And so the whole world is between 350 and 400% debt to GDP.

19:16.000 --> 19:24.000
And all of these financial claims on reality will require energy and materials to be manifested.

19:24.000 --> 19:37.000
So we keep creating more and more monetary what people think they own claims on a ecological and energetic reality that is going to shrink in the future.

19:37.000 --> 19:45.000
And so this disconnect I refer to as a bend or break moment is coming soon.

19:45.000 --> 19:50.000
So that's the first horseman is the financial recalibration.

19:50.000 --> 20:06.000
The second is the move from a unipolar, the United States effectively world to a multipolar world, China, Russia, Europe, the various BRICS plus nations.

20:06.000 --> 20:19.000
How the resource pie, how the monetary representations of who has access to what and 13,000 plus nuclear warheads.

20:19.000 --> 20:34.000
How we navigate that 21st century, early 21st century game of risk in a peaceful, cohesive, non disruptive way is one of the horsemen.

20:34.000 --> 20:53.000
The third is the complexity of our six continent just in time supply chain of medical pharmaceutical inputs and spark plugs made in South Korea only that get delivered to the United States.

20:53.000 --> 21:01.000
Food is delivered 1500 miles to the average dinner plate in the United States.

21:01.000 --> 21:18.000
We have an incredibly efficient but non resilient system for delivering basic goods and services to people around the world that is predicated on cheap oil, global peace and credit.

21:18.000 --> 21:32.000
And then the fourth is the fourth horseman is the social contract and the trust and collaboration and interaction with citizens where you live.

21:32.000 --> 21:47.000
And I don't know enough about British politics, but in the United States next year we have an election and I think no matter who wins a third of the country is going to be ballistic and upset and distrusting.

21:47.000 --> 21:55.000
And with AI and polarization and just the general stress of society, how do we keep the social contracts?

21:55.000 --> 22:09.000
So I personally think that any, and this is why I think this is important Cape, any social change towards the better in the long run.

22:09.000 --> 22:26.000
Like we need to put price on carbon because we're burning more than the biosphere can take and we're burning it millions of times faster than it was sequestered and we should save some for our grandchildren as one example.

22:26.000 --> 22:45.000
Any major wealth distribution, any social programs that make the future better off any issue that people are concerned with that radically changes our economic system will then first have to navigate these four horsemen.

22:45.000 --> 22:53.000
And that is kind of the focus of my work is no matter where we're going we have to navigate these four horsemen first.

22:53.000 --> 23:03.000
And so that ultimately my work surrounds how do we prepare and respond for those sorts of economic social speed bumps.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
Got it.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.000
Right.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
So we're going to come back to them.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.000
I have one more thing for you on this speed round.

23:09.000 --> 23:10.000
Okay.

23:10.000 --> 23:15.000
And it is, of course, the mothership concept, the great simplification.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
What is it, Nate?

23:18.000 --> 23:23.000
You know, I struggled with thinking about the name of this podcast.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.000
That one had a triple entendre.

23:26.000 --> 23:35.000
One was that for many people listening to this show in the global north, a simplification of their lives could actually be great.

23:35.000 --> 23:41.000
We don't need all this energy and pecuniary trappings to live a good meaningful life.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.000
So simplifying is a good thing.

23:44.000 --> 23:53.000
Another is I have so many complex topics in the news and I try to simplify them in a way that people can understand.

23:53.000 --> 24:11.000
But the main choice of word is an academic interpolation of Joseph Tater's work that he wrote a book called The Collapse of Complex Civilization.

24:11.000 --> 24:15.000
And what humans do is we solve problems.

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
And as the system gets bigger, we solve more problems.

24:19.000 --> 24:29.000
When we solve problems, we need more energy to throw at the technology or the supply chains or whatever it is we're solving.

24:29.000 --> 24:37.000
And so what we've done on the upslope is we have incredibly complexified our lives.

24:37.000 --> 24:51.000
And all this has happened every single year other than 2020, 2009 financial crisis, a few years in the 1970s energy crisis, World War and a Great Depression.

24:51.000 --> 25:00.000
Any of those, all the last 150 years we've had more energy added to the human system than the year before.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
And we just naturally assume that this will continue.

25:03.000 --> 25:13.000
So the great simplification is when we are unable to continue to add energy to solve our problems, the inverse will happen.

25:13.000 --> 25:28.000
A simplification where we have to do more with less technology becomes really important, efficiency becomes important, and we're going to have to live more locally.

25:28.000 --> 25:37.000
And the word great is because I think it will be one of the greatest events ever faced in modern history, this simplification.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
What does it mean in the vernacular?

25:39.000 --> 25:45.000
I think one of the next three recessions will be a depression economically.

25:45.000 --> 25:51.000
And the reason for that is had we simplified 50 years ago, then it wouldn't have been so bad.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.000
But now we've got all these financial claims that we've created.

25:56.000 --> 26:01.000
So the first step off will be a doozy.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
A what?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
A doozy.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
I don't know if that's a British term.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.000
Really?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
You don't know what that means?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
Doozy.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.000
D-O-O-Z-Y means a big one.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.000
A big one.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
A big one.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.000
Okay, it'll be a big one.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
Okay.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
Okay.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
Great.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.000
Okay.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Well, that is a big one.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
I mean, these concepts you...

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
We're probably going to have to edit that out.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.000
These concepts are big.

26:31.000 --> 26:37.000
So we're just going to take a break and I just want you to appreciate my studio here.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
Have you seen what I've done here?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.000
Yeah.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
That is...

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
Do you like that?

26:42.000 --> 26:45.000
I only see you usually from the narrow window.

26:45.000 --> 26:52.000
And now I see that you've got a great simplification podcast studio, London Style.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
Thank you so much.

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
I've always been impressed by your creation of visual aids.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Did you do that just for this show?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
Of course I did that just for this show.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.000
Oh, my gosh.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.000
I borrowed it from my neighbors and some little paper lanterns from somebody else.

27:07.000 --> 27:13.000
And yeah, just, you know, had to inhabit the studio.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.000
So it's great.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000
I like it.

27:15.000 --> 27:20.000
Well, for the record, you so could do this.

27:20.000 --> 27:26.000
I know you're very, very busy with Donut and Deal and everything, but you would be excellent at this.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.000
Well, you're very kind.

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
Actually, a podcast is high in my sights.

27:30.000 --> 27:42.000
I really think this method of exploration of ideas, of conversation is where so many people learn

27:42.000 --> 27:46.000
and have time, whether you're doing the washing up or the ironing or taking kids to school

27:46.000 --> 27:51.000
or, right, certainly for many adults, I know this is the only place I get to listen

27:51.000 --> 27:54.000
and get ideas rather than reading.

27:54.000 --> 28:02.000
But I think conversation between people is a fantastic way of all of us opening our minds,

28:02.000 --> 28:06.000
which is, I think, why this podcast has become so popular and the way you host it.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.000
So, so you've given us the big concepts, right, of a great simplification.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
Now, let's just step back.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.000
How did you get into all this then?

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
You didn't start out doing this work.

28:17.000 --> 28:21.000
Take us back to what you were doing before you were doing this.

28:21.000 --> 28:29.000
I want to hear the start of that journey and what triggering events have led you to be sitting here.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
How far back?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
You're going to have to choose that.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Take us to the place where we'll be like, you were doing what?

28:38.000 --> 28:42.000
When I was three years old, I was sitting on my mom's lap in the front seat of the car

28:42.000 --> 28:46.000
scanning the horizon for animals, and I would always want to go for a ride in the car

28:46.000 --> 28:52.000
because I wanted to see what animals we could see either on the road or on the horizon.

28:52.000 --> 28:57.000
And my mom said that by the time I was six, she had taken me to more zoos

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
than probably any other six-year-old in the United States.

29:02.000 --> 29:09.000
So that's the foundation of it, is I had a deep love for animals in the natural world when I was a child.

29:09.000 --> 29:15.000
And can I just jump in and say that's just a beautiful connection between deep love for nature, dependence on energy, right?

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Fossil energy to connect with zoos.

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
It's this wonderful, complex story that you've inhabited right from the beginning.

29:23.000 --> 29:27.000
Yeah, I didn't think about the energy part.

29:27.000 --> 29:30.000
You're absolutely right.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
I lived in Southern Oregon when I was in grade school,

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
and every day after school, I would rush home and get my dog,

29:38.000 --> 29:44.000
and we would just go for hours in the foothills and look for salamanders and climb trees.

29:44.000 --> 29:51.000
Well, he wouldn't, but that was my formative thinking where you let your mind wander

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
and you're just in nature.

29:54.000 --> 30:02.000
I mean, to have a childhood like that and the formative impression that that has on your mind and your soul

30:02.000 --> 30:10.000
is really a privilege because I don't think that many people have that freedom and access today.

30:10.000 --> 30:16.000
But I think that was my rosebud to use a citizen cane term,

30:16.000 --> 30:26.000
which is those free hours every day in the foothills of the Siski Mountains in Southern Oregon.

30:26.000 --> 30:34.000
Then I got hijacked by status-seeking and trying to make more money to get a better car

30:34.000 --> 30:41.000
and a better apartment and the American cultural dream in the 80s.

30:42.000 --> 30:47.000
I went and got my masters at the University of Chicago, and I went to work on Wall Street

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
and I managed money for billionaires effectively.

30:50.000 --> 30:58.000
I had to cold call people, but I wasn't allowed to call anyone if they were worth less than $100 million.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
I'm serious. This was 1993.

31:02.000 --> 31:10.000
Those were my clients, and over time, I realized that these people were no happier

31:10.000 --> 31:15.000
than the clerks processing their trades, making $25,000 a year.

31:19.000 --> 31:25.000
One of them started to trade, invest, speculate in oil.

31:25.000 --> 31:34.000
I started to learn a lot about oil, and I realized, oh my God, it's going to peak and decline in my lifetime.

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
Oh my God, it's incredibly powerful.

31:37.000 --> 31:42.000
I never heard the word energy mention my entire master's program in finance.

31:42.000 --> 31:47.000
What? We don't pay for any of the pollution and the externalities.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.000
Those aren't included in the prices.

31:50.000 --> 32:00.000
I became so obsessed with learning about ecology and energy that eventually I wasn't doing my job real well

32:00.000 --> 32:05.000
because I was obsessed on learning all this other stuff that I quit.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
I gave my clients their money back.

32:08.000 --> 32:13.000
I had a backpack full of books and a golden retriever, and I went to British Columbia in Alaska

32:13.000 --> 32:16.000
and hiked and thought and read for six months.

32:16.000 --> 32:22.000
Then I came back and Herman Daly introduced me to Josh Farley, who you know.

32:22.000 --> 32:30.000
Josh and John Erickson were my PhD advisors along with Robert Costanza at University of Vermont.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
That broadened out my awareness.

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
It's not just energy. It's not just oil.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
It's human behavior.

32:38.000 --> 32:45.000
It's aggregate anthropological momentum of the human superorganism.

32:45.000 --> 32:52.000
I became really intellectually curious about how all this stuff fit together.

32:52.000 --> 32:58.000
I became a contributor on the oil drum and eventually co-ran the oil drum,

32:58.000 --> 33:02.000
which was an interesting model because we had over 30 PhDs

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000
that were volunteering their time for the greater social good to share information.

33:07.000 --> 33:13.000
It was a neat little cafe sandbox of intellectual collaboration for a while.

33:13.000 --> 33:21.000
Then I got really freaked out about the debt versus energy thing in like 10 years ago.

33:21.000 --> 33:29.000
I approached Homeland Security looking at how we would buttress our supply chains

33:29.000 --> 33:36.000
if there was a Minsky moment where we realized we weren't able to service our debt.

33:36.000 --> 33:39.000
So more Minsky than the housing market?

33:39.000 --> 33:43.000
Yeah. Minsky with a capital M.

33:43.000 --> 33:48.000
Do you want to just explain because some people might not know what Minsky moment means?

33:48.000 --> 33:56.000
A Minsky moment is where you can no longer solve a credit crisis by adding more credit.

33:56.000 --> 34:05.000
It's the moment where everyone recognizes what's happening and there's an exodus

34:05.000 --> 34:11.000
and you can't solve the thing by adding more credit because there's no trust there.

34:11.000 --> 34:18.000
Right now, the markets are approaching new highs and people are still dancing

34:18.000 --> 34:25.000
because the credit spigot is still on, but they're dancing closer to the doors in talking with them.

34:25.000 --> 34:31.000
But anyways, getting back to your question, which I'm giving way too long winded of an answer,

34:31.000 --> 34:43.000
I then started realizing that the people in middle age between 25 and 60 have no bandwidth

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
because their status and identity were attached to the jobs and the positions they were in.

34:48.000 --> 34:54.000
In this story, the great simplification, which wasn't fully formed back then,

34:54.000 --> 34:59.000
was too abstract and threatening to their current work.

34:59.000 --> 35:07.000
And so I did a barbell approach where I started to teach reality 101 to young people

35:07.000 --> 35:14.000
and I talked to retired politicians above 70 years old who had time to learn about these things.

35:14.000 --> 35:24.000
And then two years ago, just about now, I started this podcast and I've learned a ton

35:24.000 --> 35:31.000
and I'll echo what you just said a few minutes ago that I have a pretty strong opinion

35:31.000 --> 35:41.000
about how the world works and where we're headed, but I also know that no one can know everything

35:41.000 --> 35:46.000
and there's so many things that I learned from all of my conversations.

35:46.000 --> 35:52.000
And so I'm just trying to connect this tapestry of how things fit together,

35:52.000 --> 36:02.000
but not only facts, also the humanity of people and how everyone on this program that I've hosted

36:02.000 --> 36:08.000
really cares about the future and not a lot of us have answers on what to do,

36:08.000 --> 36:15.000
but I think there's this emergence of this intellectual, heart-led understanding

36:15.000 --> 36:22.000
and hope for a better future that there's something building there that I think is potentially important.

36:22.000 --> 36:31.000
Right. And then on that journey from, say, working with those multi-millionaires to now,

36:31.000 --> 36:35.000
just to keep you could name one big cognitive shift that you've made,

36:35.000 --> 36:43.000
one big emotional change that you've made in your life and practical changes about where and how you live.

36:43.000 --> 36:51.000
A big cognitive change. The cognitive change is the superorganism is incredibly powerful

36:51.000 --> 36:58.000
and 15 years ago, I wouldn't have imagined that on the dawn of 2024,

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
we would still have this amount of debt and this amount of energy.

37:03.000 --> 37:16.000
The cognitive change is that this superorganism has got gold-plated scales and is very difficult to stop.

37:16.000 --> 37:23.000
So I've cognitively come to respect that, though at the same time, the more it grows and expands,

37:23.000 --> 37:30.000
the worse the biosphere and other species are generally.

37:30.000 --> 37:44.000
Emotionally, well, I've grieved for the future that our society tells us is coming long ago.

37:45.000 --> 37:51.000
So my expectations are lower than the average person.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.000
So emotionally, I've come to terms with that.

37:57.000 --> 38:02.000
But emotionally, there's a bifurcation, Kate.

38:02.000 --> 38:09.000
On the one hand, the stuff that I carry is increasingly feels like a lodestone

38:10.000 --> 38:18.000
because I'm trying to stay on top of neuroscience and oil depletion and debt and biodiversity loss

38:18.000 --> 38:24.000
and endocrine disruptors and each one of those categories is kind of fricking depressing.

38:24.000 --> 38:35.000
And when you aggregate them all, humans didn't evolve to carry that amount of stress about the future

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
with them every day.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.000
And the antidote to that, as you might know, because we were just together last month, two months ago,

38:43.000 --> 38:50.000
is being with people like you and other colleagues that are working on this is like a balm

38:50.000 --> 38:54.000
because I don't feel so alone and I don't feel the burden as much

38:54.000 --> 38:57.000
because other people are living through thinking the same things.

38:57.000 --> 39:03.000
So emotionally, that's kind of the battle.

39:03.000 --> 39:07.000
And before you go on for one, actually, I just want to jump in there and say I recognize that as well,

39:07.000 --> 39:13.000
the value of connecting with others and just to recognize that through the work I do with Donut Economics Action Lab,

39:13.000 --> 39:21.000
what I've discovered is there are just so many people who share this but will never be on a podcast

39:21.000 --> 39:25.000
or their name will never be known or will never get publicly recognized,

39:25.000 --> 39:32.000
but in their communities, in their classrooms, in their town halls, they are leading and doing this and holding this as well.

39:32.000 --> 39:39.000
And I get huge energy and solidarity from that as well,

39:39.000 --> 39:47.000
that there's so many people who actually in their own way are holding the recognition that the complexity

39:47.000 --> 39:50.000
and what has to change in starting to try and make it happen.

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
The third one was how have you changed where you live and how you live?

39:53.000 --> 39:57.000
I live on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin.

39:57.000 --> 40:04.000
I think it's a reasonably good place for the future, low population density.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.000
People are kind of generally Scandinavian socialists here.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
They help their neighbors.

40:09.000 --> 40:13.000
It's close to the Mississippi River.

40:13.000 --> 40:16.000
All the people I know and love are in the United States.

40:16.000 --> 40:21.000
I mean, my family are in the United States.

40:21.000 --> 40:28.000
For the longest time, my girlfriend and I grew maybe 30 or 40% of our own food

40:28.000 --> 40:39.000
and we have horses and hazelnuts and apple trees and we were selling garlic to the local farmers market

40:39.000 --> 40:43.000
because we grew thousands of bulbs.

40:43.000 --> 40:50.000
But when I started this work, like in earnest a couple years ago, all that kind of changed

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
because I was very fricking busy.

40:52.000 --> 40:59.000
So I'm trying to advocate that people simplify and my own life is suddenly complexified

40:59.000 --> 41:07.000
and I struggle with that because I don't have time to do the weeding and the wood chopping

41:07.000 --> 41:12.000
and the planting and the things that I was doing myself four years ago.

41:13.000 --> 41:22.000
The other thing is one of the things I really recognize as a roadblock to sustainability

41:22.000 --> 41:31.000
and living differently is our connection to social media and computers and instant stimulation technology

41:31.000 --> 41:37.000
and I rail against that, especially with my 19-year-old students.

41:37.000 --> 41:45.000
And yet I'm being pulled right back into it myself kind of unavoidably as an externality of this work

41:45.000 --> 41:50.000
and I joke that I'm using the devil's tools to do Gaia's work

41:50.000 --> 41:56.000
and there has to be kind of a middle of the fairway response there

41:56.000 --> 42:01.000
but that's something that I'm struggling with in what I'm doing.

42:01.000 --> 42:11.000
I could live in a 10 by 10 shack on the property here and use very little resources and live on the land

42:11.000 --> 42:16.000
but then I wouldn't be hosting a podcast and passing the baton to other humans

42:16.000 --> 42:19.000
who are trying to make a difference on our collective issues.

42:19.000 --> 42:25.000
So it will probably perpetually be a challenge that I'm sure you also deal with.

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Yeah, so a couple of things.

42:27.000 --> 42:34.000
So when you say I don't have the time and I always think time is the ultimate constraint of our energy budget

42:34.000 --> 42:41.000
because in a way what you're saying is I don't have the time to use my own energy, my own bodily energy

42:41.000 --> 42:48.000
to chop wood and to plant food and to do all the other things as well

42:48.000 --> 42:54.000
because using my own energy, doing a great simplification requires more of my time budget.

42:55.000 --> 42:59.000
So of course we're always talking about energy.

42:59.000 --> 43:03.000
Everything is always about energy because it's the currency behind everything else we're doing

43:03.000 --> 43:08.000
but I'm really struck with the way energy keeps coming up, of course, in the story that you're telling.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.000
I want to ask you one thing that I find challenging.

43:11.000 --> 43:15.000
You're one of many people I know in the UK as well.

43:15.000 --> 43:19.000
I know quite a few people working in the climate movement or environmental movement

43:19.000 --> 43:24.000
and I live in the city of Oxford or they might live in London

43:24.000 --> 43:31.000
and then there comes a moment when they lead the city and they go rural and they buy land

43:31.000 --> 43:35.000
and they buy high land and they start growing food

43:35.000 --> 43:41.000
and as a city dweller I think like is this prepping

43:41.000 --> 43:47.000
and what challenges me is that we can't all buy that land

43:47.000 --> 43:51.000
and there's not right Mark Twain buy land, they don't make it any more well.

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000
There isn't enough for everyone to take that route so I kind of stand firmly in the city

43:56.000 --> 44:00.000
and think well we have to make it work here too because most of us are here

44:00.000 --> 44:03.000
so I'd just love to hear your little bit of a challenge there

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
and we just want to hear your response to that.

44:05.000 --> 44:10.000
We can't all go rural and buy land and grow our own food.

44:10.000 --> 44:15.000
I don't own the land I'm on and I totally agree with you

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
and this gets to a larger issue of the messaging

44:20.000 --> 44:26.000
and the help of this podcast to various people around the world.

44:26.000 --> 44:30.000
Everyone is in a different situation, there's not one size fits all

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
and that is something I struggle with.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.000
As far as land, I just love living really and I always have.

44:37.000 --> 44:43.000
I just hated New York City, I had to get out of there, it was sucking my soul.

44:43.000 --> 44:49.000
As far as prepping, this gets back to the economic concept of comparative advantage.

44:49.000 --> 44:55.000
I've learned that like one unit, one family, they can't do everything

44:55.000 --> 45:03.000
and so I like to think of pro-social prepping that the first and most important thing there isn't land,

45:03.000 --> 45:08.000
it's community and getting to know others and sharing responsibility

45:08.000 --> 45:13.000
and you grow this and I'll process this or whatever

45:13.000 --> 45:19.000
because there isn't enough time for every family to do all the things.

45:19.000 --> 45:27.000
But yeah, the rural versus urban, I don't know the answer to that.

45:27.000 --> 45:37.000
I think cities have ecological footprints, orders of magnitude larger than their physical proximity

45:37.000 --> 45:42.000
and I don't know how that's all going to work out but I hear your challenge there

45:42.000 --> 45:53.000
and I feel so privileged and lucky to live on the land and have animals, horses, chickens, geese, no geese, ducks,

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
guinea fowl and dogs and cats.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
I don't have children but I do have animals.

46:00.000 --> 46:06.000
I like the concept of pro-social prepping because that's something we can all do everywhere

46:06.000 --> 46:11.000
and David Sloan Wilson will be the first to say we should all be doing pro-social prepping all the time

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
because we're going to need it.

46:13.000 --> 46:17.000
That is one technology, one connection that we are all going to need whatever.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
Totally agree.

46:18.000 --> 46:25.000
Yeah, so you've told us the story of how you got your journey to here.

46:25.000 --> 46:31.000
So let's hear your view on humanity's journey from here.

46:31.000 --> 46:38.000
Okay, so I want to come back to the super organism concept and I've heard you in some of your franklies

46:38.000 --> 46:41.000
or in some conversations with people.

46:41.000 --> 46:46.000
It sounds like the super organism and by the way, as you know, I asked on Twitter,

46:46.000 --> 46:49.000
hey, I'm turning the table and it's anybody and I got Godney questions

46:49.000 --> 46:54.000
and people brought so many questions and thank you to everybody who brought in questions.

46:54.000 --> 46:59.000
I'm not going to bring in as many of them as I can, but quite a few questions were around this.

46:59.000 --> 47:05.000
So do you think that the super organism is beyond control?

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
It's just going to roll.

47:08.000 --> 47:16.000
You recently interviewed Robert Sapolsky who said, you know, we are hardwired to get it wrong.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.000
Well, are we hardwired to get it wrong?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
So are we hardwired to get it wrong?

47:20.000 --> 47:25.000
So the super organism is a source of finance and the structures and the supply chains

47:25.000 --> 47:30.000
that all that contribute to this super organism.

47:30.000 --> 47:37.000
Do you believe it's just locked in, inevitable that this is beyond our control?

47:37.000 --> 47:43.000
Because that's a pretty strong conclusion to come to.

47:44.000 --> 47:49.000
Wiring from our successful ancestors.

47:49.000 --> 47:57.000
That can be soft or hard, depending on culture and the circumstances.

47:57.000 --> 48:03.000
I love my conversation with Robert until the free will part.

48:03.000 --> 48:06.000
And granted, I'm not an expert on that.

48:07.000 --> 48:15.000
But the way that I see it is there are ecological and biological laws that are unfolding.

48:15.000 --> 48:22.000
One is the maximum power principle, which is organisms and ecosystems in nature self-organized

48:22.000 --> 48:28.000
so as to degrade basically an energy gradient or an amount of energy surplus.

48:28.000 --> 48:32.000
And we as a civilization have been doing that.

48:32.000 --> 48:41.000
And sometimes I think that we had to come to this point of finding fossil carbon

48:41.000 --> 48:50.000
and building this monstrosity of a Rube Goldberg machine nature-eating mousetrap

48:50.000 --> 48:55.000
in order to really have this gut check as a culture, as a species,

48:55.000 --> 48:59.000
on a deep time perspective of where we are, where we're headed,

48:59.000 --> 49:07.000
what we know, how we can do it to actually change the default path that we've created.

49:07.000 --> 49:15.000
And I'm uncertain about what's going to happen,

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
but there are certain things I'm quite confident in.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
Growth will end.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.000
That is a certainty.

49:22.000 --> 49:26.000
What's uncertain is how long in the future that will be

49:26.000 --> 49:32.000
and what sort of a drop that will be and what happens afterward.

49:32.000 --> 49:37.000
So the super organism is in control.

49:37.000 --> 49:41.000
Just look at the prime minister in your country.

49:41.000 --> 49:46.000
And the president of my country are both ostensibly climate aware,

49:46.000 --> 49:53.000
yet they're approving new leases in Alaska and in the North Sea

49:53.000 --> 49:58.000
because of the momentum of the system demands that we have that energy.

49:58.000 --> 50:06.000
So I just don't know that any group of humans, as powerful even as they might be,

50:06.000 --> 50:12.000
could stop this system until it stops of its own momentum,

50:12.000 --> 50:19.000
which is that debt gets too big or there's a war that cascades everything down

50:19.000 --> 50:23.000
or any number of things that would actually stop it of its own accord.

50:23.000 --> 50:26.000
Other than that, I think we will...

50:26.000 --> 50:31.000
Well, since 2015, the Paris Accord,

50:31.000 --> 50:37.000
all the industrialized nations, perhaps with the exception of the US,

50:37.000 --> 50:41.000
accept that climate is happening and it's because of emissions.

50:41.000 --> 50:48.000
Yet since that time, we've grown our coal capacity by over 200 gigawatts globally.

50:48.000 --> 50:54.000
So all the scaling of renewable energy and everything that's happening

50:54.000 --> 50:59.000
that is ostensibly good for climate in the local region where it is,

50:59.000 --> 51:04.000
hasn't done a thing to slow emissions globally.

51:04.000 --> 51:12.000
So from an ecological climate CO2 biosphere perspective,

51:12.000 --> 51:17.000
the superorganism is still completely in control.

51:17.000 --> 51:22.000
And so what I'm trying to think about is what are the things we can do now

51:22.000 --> 51:27.000
to anticipate and change the initial conditions of the moment

51:27.000 --> 51:36.000
when the superorganism of its own weight and momentum and metabolism starts to splinter.

51:36.000 --> 51:39.000
And I think that's coming in the not too distant future.

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
I don't know that I answered your question.

51:41.000 --> 51:47.000
This is... I mean, I do interviews all the time, like I'm on someone else's podcast,

51:47.000 --> 51:53.000
but to have you interview me on my podcast, it's a little strange, but...

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Did that make sense to you, Kate?

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Yeah, it did. And so I want to ask...

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
I mean, there's so many things coming up for me.

51:59.000 --> 52:03.000
So you said, you know, we've done nothing at all to slow the growth of global emissions.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.000
And I want to say, wait, well, we don't know the counterfactual.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.000
What we know, we haven't stopped them from growing.

52:08.000 --> 52:12.000
But perhaps, I mean, for all the civic...

52:12.000 --> 52:16.000
If we hadn't done these things, then emissions would have been 10% higher than they are now.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
OK, right.

52:17.000 --> 52:21.000
So that means that there is resistance, there is intention to transform,

52:21.000 --> 52:27.000
and it's having some impact, which, of course, for people who are dedicating their lives

52:27.000 --> 52:31.000
or their weekends to resistance to transformation,

52:31.000 --> 52:36.000
that's really important to know that we can actually make a dent on this thing.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.000
We can start to shift it and we can believe that we can...

52:40.000 --> 52:45.000
If we mobilize the right way and a lot of things come into line, we can move this.

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
I mean, I just want to offer some counters.

52:48.000 --> 52:56.000
Yes, OK, the US and the UK still opening up licenses for new oil.

52:56.000 --> 53:01.000
And yet other countries, Colombia, signing up to the fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty.

53:01.000 --> 53:05.000
Other countries committing to move away from it massively investing in renewables.

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
So there are other countries that are doing differently.

53:08.000 --> 53:14.000
So there's evidence that is not every political leader is locked into only going this direction.

53:14.000 --> 53:20.000
And of course, we need that evidence and the hope of possibility that change can be made.

53:20.000 --> 53:24.000
Boy, so lots of things to say here.

53:24.000 --> 53:29.000
First of all, our entire civilization is based on carbon.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.000
And so if we stop burning coal and natural gas and oil,

53:34.000 --> 53:40.000
indirectly all the things in Walmart and Home Depot and whatever the shops are in London,

53:40.000 --> 53:43.000
all of those have indirect carbon in there.

53:43.000 --> 53:46.000
And I am a proponent that...

53:46.000 --> 53:50.000
I'm not a degrowth proponent.

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
I think degrowth is what we should do,

53:53.000 --> 54:00.000
but it's not going to happen because of the super organism dynamic.

54:00.000 --> 54:04.000
Post growth is what we're going to have to prepare for.

54:04.000 --> 54:12.000
And so I just think that every scrap of cheap fossil energy

54:12.000 --> 54:17.000
when economic times get tough will probably be sought after.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.000
I mean, India right now is...

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
And China, China has the most renewable energy,

54:23.000 --> 54:27.000
but they also have the most coal and they're scaling coal dramatically.

54:27.000 --> 54:34.000
But my larger point is this and something I really struggle with, Kate,

54:34.000 --> 54:40.000
is I'm trying to act as a witness and a translator of what's going on,

54:40.000 --> 54:44.000
both in my own analysis and in the people that I interview.

54:44.000 --> 54:54.000
That is different than being a cheerleader and a spokesperson and an activist.

54:54.000 --> 55:04.000
So I really struggle with this podcast at times on being accurate or being helpful.

55:05.000 --> 55:12.000
And I really do think that a lot of the discussions in the climate and degrowth space

55:12.000 --> 55:17.000
are energy blind and they don't realize the critical importance

55:17.000 --> 55:22.000
that oil and other energy has to every aspect of our society

55:22.000 --> 55:26.000
and that if we were to do the right thing ecologically

55:26.000 --> 55:31.000
and really crimp our use of hydrocarbons,

55:31.000 --> 55:37.000
that would entail a massive collapse in the state of our world

55:37.000 --> 55:42.000
unless it happened gradually and it was planned for.

55:42.000 --> 55:48.000
And I'm trying to tell the truth but also be inspiring and helpful to people

55:48.000 --> 55:51.000
and sometimes that's hard.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
So much to say in response.

55:53.000 --> 55:58.000
I recognize that you may struggle with am I being a witness

55:58.000 --> 56:01.000
and am I being helpful because of course I'm sure you're very aware

56:01.000 --> 56:06.000
that your voice and your opinion also has influence.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
It's not just from the outside.

56:08.000 --> 56:13.000
So you might say I'm not an activist but the position you hold

56:13.000 --> 56:20.000
and the forecast that you see has influence upon the world

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
and so in a way it's an action, it's playing into it.

56:25.000 --> 56:26.000
But I want to pick up on...

56:26.000 --> 56:29.000
I mean you're the person from whom I know the phrase

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
will we bend or break?

56:31.000 --> 56:34.000
Now that tells me that there's an option there

56:34.000 --> 56:39.000
that this isn't just we're going to roll it out, we're just going to use it all.

56:39.000 --> 56:46.000
There is a choice and there's a possibility that we could bend

56:46.000 --> 56:50.000
and we have left it late as you've said but that we can bend

56:50.000 --> 56:56.000
and I see your podcast as informing us so that we can be as informed as we can.

56:56.000 --> 57:02.000
How do we now bend rather than we're just watching this thing slide towards break?

57:02.000 --> 57:08.000
Yeah, so the bend versus break initiated with my work with Homeland Security

57:08.000 --> 57:14.000
on the financial recalibration because when that happens

57:14.000 --> 57:19.000
and things cascade, it could be really bad

57:19.000 --> 57:26.000
and of course nuclear war or all kinds of other things could precipitate that.

57:26.000 --> 57:31.000
I actually am hopeful that humans will navigate what's coming

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
and that we will bend as opposed to break

57:34.000 --> 57:40.000
but bending isn't just turning off coal and natural gas and installing solar panels

57:40.000 --> 57:44.000
the ask is much, much deeper than that.

57:44.000 --> 57:49.000
I'm agnostic on whether renewables globally

57:49.000 --> 57:52.000
and as you know you've watched my stuff.

57:52.000 --> 57:55.000
There's no such thing as renewable energy.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.000
The ball of gas in the sky is renewable and the wind is renewable

57:59.000 --> 58:03.000
but these components that we build to harvest the sun and the wind

58:03.000 --> 58:06.000
will have to be rebuilt every 20 or 30 years.

58:06.000 --> 58:10.000
Very little of the components that go into them are being recycled

58:10.000 --> 58:15.000
so without this giant amount of energy surplus that we take for granted

58:15.000 --> 58:20.000
how will we build those things 20 years from now, 40 years from now, 60 years from now?

58:20.000 --> 58:24.000
So the answers are we're going to have to use less

58:24.000 --> 58:29.000
but we're not going to choose to use less as a society.

58:29.000 --> 58:34.000
As individuals and communities maybe we can choose to use less ahead of time

58:34.000 --> 58:39.000
psychologically becoming more resilient by consuming less

58:39.000 --> 58:44.000
prepares an individual for a simplified future.

58:44.000 --> 58:49.000
And then I think the social capital of having conversations about this

58:49.000 --> 58:54.000
in communities wherever you live in the world

58:54.000 --> 58:59.000
looking two or three steps ahead and trying to ignore the siren song of

58:59.000 --> 59:04.000
AI and cooler gadgets and markets are near all-time highs

59:04.000 --> 59:08.000
and we've always had problems before and technology solved it

59:08.000 --> 59:12.000
and look at what's really happening at the ground level.

59:12.000 --> 59:17.000
I do think humans will have some emergent practices

59:17.000 --> 59:23.000
and new things that I can't even offer to you right now.

59:23.000 --> 59:29.000
I just see it in a lot of places that these conversations are happening.

59:29.000 --> 59:33.000
I lost the core of your question there.

59:33.000 --> 59:37.000
So we're on bend or break I was really struck and I was glad to hear you say

59:37.000 --> 59:42.000
I'm hopeful that we can bend and it's going to take a lot more.

59:42.000 --> 59:50.000
Let me make a clarification on something earlier.

59:50.000 --> 59:55.000
I chose the word simplification because I think we're headed for a smaller

59:55.000 --> 59:58.000
less global less material society.

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000
I did not use the word collapse.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
First of all collapse is binary.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:07.000
It's yes collapse or no collapse.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Simplification is more of a spectrum.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Second of all the great simplification is already here.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
It's just not evenly distributed.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I mean there are many places in the world that are already suffering

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
a post-economic peak.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
For instance I had a young woman from Lebanon on the podcast.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Lebanon's economy is down 50% from three years ago.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
That is a simplification and I'm sure people following the news

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000
all different places in the world are experiencing natural resource problems

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:46.000
and economic problems and currency problems.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.000
So I don't think collapse is inevitable.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
I think a simplification is inevitable.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
But I guess it depends on how you define the terms.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Right and just to come back I heard you say several times over many episodes

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
degrowth is what we should do.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Post-growth is what we probably will do.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Can I just clarify because people mean very different things when they use this language.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Do you mean by degrowth do you mean a planned...

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I mean this is what when I listen to leading thinkers in the degrowth movement

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
like Jason Hickel and Yorgos Callis they would say

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
degrowth means a planned reduction in material and energy use

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
of the less necessary consumption and production.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:31.000
So do you mean we should plan to reduce

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000
but you don't think that we will do it

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000
and therefore we'll get post-growth which would be a forced reduction.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Would that be a way of putting it?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Yes.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
A little more I'll add to that.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
From an ecological deep time ethical perspective

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
degrowth is what we should do.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.000
If you had a benevolent pro-social alien philosopher looking at Earth

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
our consumption is massively unsustainable

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
so to protect the biosphere for future generations of ours and other species

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.000
we should use a lot less

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000
and we should be living within our means.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
I don't think that will happen.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Can I just interrupt you that moment and say like

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
here's a doughnut they made earlier it's the same thing right?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
An alien looking at this would say

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
humans sort yourselves out

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
come back within planetary boundaries

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
by reducing your energy and material through flow

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000
meet the needs of the poorest people in the world

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000
and to me this is a visual of very similar to that same message

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000
of planned reduction that meets the needs of all.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000
So we're agreeing so degrowth and doughnut

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000
and yourself on that would say yes this is what we should do.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
That's the should.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Okay, continue.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Well on the doughnut

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000
what I would say is that

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
human behavior, individual and aggregate

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000
that the inner part of the doughnut

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
will not want to stay within boundaries

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
it will want to expand

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000
and so the inner part of the doughnut

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
will want to be greater than its planetary boundaries

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.000
and that's what we face of sorts.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
So I think the doughnut to use your work and your example

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
is a great carrot for an Overton window

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
of where we need to go

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:30.000
but what I mean about degrowth not happening

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
is I don't think there is a way politically

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.000
for a country or a world

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
to consciously with a plan degrow

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
because there would be riots

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.000
and craziness and financial market collapses

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and nuclear war and actually if it were

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.000
if we did have the authoritarian means

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
to degrow voluntarily

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I think it would trigger the four horsemen

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
in quite bad ways.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
What we can do.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Wouldn't the continued pursuit of growth

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I've also heard you say like the continued pursuit of growth

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.000
is likely to trigger those very same things.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Yes and here we are Kate, that's correct

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
but that's not immediate

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:22.000
and there are chances that we might design some new technology

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000
if AI were suddenly to imbue wisdom

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
into its algorithms as well as intelligence

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm not holding my breath

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
but there are possible ways that we could

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
invent mushrooms that sequester carbon

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000
and that we change our GDP

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:48.000
to include things that are of ecosystem service benefits

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
or things that I can't imagine

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000
but my larger point is that degrowth

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
we can change the initial conditions

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000
which is why a lot of my friends are in the degrowth movement

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
because we ultimately have to start thinking about

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
how to organize our own lives and that's of society

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
by using less material and resources.

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:15.000
I just think it not only won't happen voluntarily

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000
but it is incredibly dangerous where it to happen

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
suddenly and voluntarily.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
But to me this is the home turf towards bend

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.000
like if we're going to bend, not break

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
we have to, whether it's in the name of degrowth

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
or other movements that we need to move in this direction

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
you said you're hopeful that we can bend

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
so I want to take our conversation in that direction

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
can we go there?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
What would it take in different areas

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
if I can bring some different areas

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
so first of all I want to ask you

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
do you think that civil disobedience

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
and nonviolent direct action that we've seen

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000
rising up around the world in different movements

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:02.000
do you think that is a way that people can play a role

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.000
in helping to make something happen

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
that the system will start to bend?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000
So let me clarify something

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000
bend versus break could be society as a whole

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
in the past I've largely used it

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.000
to refer to the financial overshoot that we have

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000
that when we issue new money

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000
that money is just digital or electronic

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:31.000
or paper claims on a physical reality

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
we spend it on building out our physical reality

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
at the same time there's a liability

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
if we owe this money in the future

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:41.000
so we're building our physical structure higher

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.000
and eventually there's going to be this

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
wily coyote moment where those claims

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:51.000
can't be fulfilled by our underlying reality

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000
and so when I refer to bend versus break

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
it's that moment

01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:00.000
but you also could say we're at a social contract

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
bend or break moment

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000
and you also very correctly could say

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
we're at a planetary boundaries bend or break moment

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
so there's lots of different bend versus breaks

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000
so as far as civil disobedience

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.000
I'm of two minds with that

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000
a lot of the people that are out there

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:26.000
with just stop oil and other civil disobedience

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
have the same value systems that I do

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
so in that sense I fully support

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000
what they're doing and their intent

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
but from the perspective of the four horsemen

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
which is my systems ecology vantage point

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
I have two problems with that

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000
one is there could be a triggering of

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:53.000
a disruption that could be the cure is worse than the disease

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
and the second is that for all of these things

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
that we care about

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000
we're looking at a non-systemic solution

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000
like let's make natural gas and propane stoves

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
in the northeast make those illegal

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
or let's shut down all the coal plants

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:20.000
so those two things would be good for climate change

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
for the people that care about climate change

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
but everyone else is looking at that

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
and saying why are we doing that

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
that doesn't make sense from our economic

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
our current cultural values standpoint

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:36.000
so we're solving things by using our lens

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.000
of the problem without looking at the whole system

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
and so I think we need to have an extension

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.000
of the degrowth conversation is

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:54.000
how do we live and plan for a less connected

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
global society where our aspirations

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
are something more than consumption

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
and dopamine etc

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
and I know that's embedded in the degrowth

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
of scholarship in places

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
and it's embedded in your work on the donut

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:17.000
so I'm I just I guess I'm too focused on

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
the systemic risk aspect to be a big fan

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
of civil disobedience

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
but we can't go on a march saying

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:31.000
make everything right again

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.000
right and that's why I'm at a crossroads

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.000
in this work Kate because other than

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
individual preparation and designing

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:47.000
ben not break policies for governments

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I don't know what the the movement is

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000
that would be popular and this is a big

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000
challenge with this podcast is there are

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
so many different demographics that follow

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
this show there are energy experts and

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
there are psychologists and there's

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
degrowthers and there's a lot of climate

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
people that follow this and it's hard to

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:17.000
look at everything beyond the one thing

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.000
that you care about and so what ends up

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:22.000
happening is events in the world are

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000
getting dicier and worse and so I'm

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000
expanding this conversation but it ends

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.000
up offending people that are in one area

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000
of their focus and it's really hard

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000
this could be a much more popular and

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
maybe helpful podcast if I just focused

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.000
on one thing and you know bellowed my

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
heart and soul out on that one thing

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
and attracted those viewers in the world

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
that were knowledgeable and cared about

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
that one thing but the one thing is the

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
system it's how all this stuff fits

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:05.000
together and I do not know what the

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
answers are in fact I don't even use the

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.000
word answers or solutions I use responses

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000
and in coming months I'm going to have

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000
franklies on responses to government

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
for philanthropy for communities and

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
for individuals and these are just

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.000
guesses because I've spent 20 years

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
trying to understand the problem and

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
that qualifies me to say well no I

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
don't think that'll work because of X

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
but I don't know what to do Kate.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
Yeah have you ever had anyone on the

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
podcast who speaks from experience of

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000
leading and immersed in civil disobedience?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Well yesterday I interviewed Bill

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
McKibbin who has a very long success

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.000
track record of building movements as

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:57.000
far as civil disobedience no I have not.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Maybe that could be a cool one for the

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000
future because I personally you know I

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
take my kids to their school right when

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
they were changing going to secondary

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
school and you go in the classroom see

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
these schools and like who's on the wall

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Emily and Pankhurst, Suffragette, Scandi,

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Martin Luther King it's like all these

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000
heroes are on the wall and we know that

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
every one of them in their day were so

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000
troublesome so annoying so disruptive

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
and yet we celebrate them now for what

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
they did to change this big system so I

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
deeply believe in the power of civil

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000
disobedience and nonviolent direct action

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
to at least try at least to seek to

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000
persuade presidents and prime ministers

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000
not to open up that oil field and to

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:46.000
and to transform so all these different

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
pieces of pressure but anyway I would

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
love to hear you interviewed.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
At a deep level this podcast and if I

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
keep it going in the future is a form

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
of civil disobedience because the

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
things that I will be saying are going

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000
to be threatening to the status quo.

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
Okay okay keep listening.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
But I will take your advice and if you

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
could recommend someone for me to

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
interview I will do that.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Oh sure I can.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
So I'm going to lean us into okay what

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
if we we could bend right I'm talking

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.000
about a system as a whole now it could

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:20.000
it could it could bend if we align

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:23.000
enough things or it will break so I

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.000
want us to lean into the possibility

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
of bend now and I'm just going to ask

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
you from different sectoral points of

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
view just kind of going back to short

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.000
first take answers okay so the finance

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000
system okay from here what would we

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000
need to do if we were to bend finance

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
as it has been created and I'm just

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000
going to recognize that it's entirely

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
human construct it's entirely invented

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:51.000
so we can reconstruct it but we are

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
where we are right now what do you think

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000
could be done to make it start to move

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
towards bend other than what what I see

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
seeing coming is is a great big snapping

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.000
sound and that's the simplification.

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000
So on on each of these topics there is

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000
a what to do now what to do at the

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:14.000
moment of a crisis and what to do like

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:17.000
that's more sustainable in 30 or 40 years

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
30 or 40 years from now the financial

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:22.000
system should be smaller leverage that

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.000
got us into this weapons of financial

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000
mass destruction should not be allowed

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000
the currency should be tethered to

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:34.000
something real like land or energy

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000
production but for us to do that now

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:43.000
given the gargantuan you know 100

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000
trillion a day and currency swaps and

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000
things like that you can't get there

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000
what needs to be done to avoid break is

01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:00.000
if we go back to a 2009 moment when we

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
were on the cusp of all the banks in the

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000
world failing and they came through

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000
with tarp and the bazookas of central

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
banks and government guarantees which

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
many of which are still 14 years later

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:20.000
in operation if that were to happen

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
again I think there should be a bend

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
not break strategies within central

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000
banks and governments to maintain

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:31.000
transaction capacity and there's going

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
to have to be haircuts they're going to

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
have to be haircuts at banks people

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000
won't be able to have own everything

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
that they think they own which is

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000
itself an information hazard to talk

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000
about on a podcast but this is not this

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000
is popular in in earth sciences but in

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
the broader public sphere this isn't

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000
that popular of a podcast all sorts of

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000
things there that governments can

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.000
respond to the things that will make the

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:04.000
financial system more stable would break

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
the financial system right now this is

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
the problem we should have a carbon tax

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.000
the carbon tax would prick the bubble

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:17.000
of our debt fueled central bank led

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:22.000
orgy of consumption so I think

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:26.000
gradually if we were to put a small tax

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.000
on currency transactions gradually if

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:36.000
we had money creation that was tethered

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000
to ecological services or pro-social

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:42.000
outcomes that's some aspect of what we

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
had kind of like a local currency but

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.000
at a national level have this I'm just

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000
totally thinking out loud right now

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000
have it have it generated in a way that

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.000
you can pay some portion of your taxes

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000
in this parallel currency but that

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:03.000
parallel currency gets issued for doing

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.000
things aligned with the donut for

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:10.000
instance that minimizes our consumption

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000
and keeps us within planetary boundaries

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:17.000
the that kind of makes sense in an

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.000
intermediate term in the short term

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.000
though here's the thing is the things

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:26.000
that would solve our financial overshoot

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
we're doing the exact opposite we're

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000
doing more of those things that make the

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:34.000
bubble bigger which gets back to the

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
minsky thing so I think the way to

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
prepare for that is to prepare

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:43.000
individuals communities supply chains

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:47.000
businesses for disruption so that

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000
they're not so beholden to a sudden

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
disruption in a material inputs from

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:58.000
across the world etc a reshoring of

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
basic needs and if that reshoring is

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:04.000
effective then the break scenario becomes

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.000
less likely I wish the Belgian

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:10.000
currency theorist Bernard Lietar was still

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000
alive because I would have loved to hear

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
you have him on this podcast he just

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
recently died right he was on my list to

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.000
he died a few years ago yeah he was I

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:25.000
think the way he talked about the design

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
of money and the need for an ecosystem of

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:31.000
monies and currencies massively influenced

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
me and I would have just loved to hear

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.000
him contribute to the kind of designs

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
you were starting to come up with there

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.000
somebody who comes to my mind often with

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
this podcast is Stephanie Kelton one of

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:46.000
the leading theorists known in relation

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
to modern monetary theory and I would

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.000
just love to hear lots of people on

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
Twitter said I want to hear Nate talk

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000
about modern monetary theory does he know

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
about it what does he think about it and

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
I really really hope you'll have her on

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
this podcast and you may profoundly

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
disagree but I think you'd really

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
respectfully listen and try and figure

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
out where's the overlap in your world

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
views or you may really agree but what

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
would be your take on modern monetary

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.000
theory right now I will answer that but

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
I'll preface it with this it is a

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
challenge and this is why I do the

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
franklies because a lot of my guests

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
first of all I invite people on that A

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000
have some some credible expertise

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:31.000
on a thing and B that it's relevant to

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
the great simplification and C that

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000
they're good people but what ends up

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000
happening is a lot of times I agree

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
with my guests a lot on issue number

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000
one and issue number two I totally

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.000
disagree with them but I can't spend

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000
the whole I'm not a debater I don't

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000
like want to stomp on their words and

01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:00.000
try to disagree with people at every

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000
point that I disagree with them so I've

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
learned and I've gotten better at this

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
over time I let the guest do 80 or 90

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
percent of the talking and then on my

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:12.000
franklies I kind of bookend it with

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000
with my world view but it's it's

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
challenging and if you end up being a

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000
host I'm sure you're so gracious and

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:24.000
diplomatic that that'll be not a problem

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:28.000
for you but I'm actually happy with that

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000
because I'm kind of a talker my girlfriend

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
says it's my best skill as I just talk

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
so naturally I didn't naturally I have a

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:39.000
podcast but I've I have become a better

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.000
listener and who knows I may be really

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
wrong about some of these things and my

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
guests are absolutely right and that's

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.000
why the the universe of ideas and this

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
is in a sorts peer review in real time

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:55.000
of of talking and there's no way it can

01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:00.000
be perfect but I do I am learning and

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.000
there are there are huge issues of

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:08.000
complexity that are present Stephanie

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Kelton I've heard wonderful things about

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
her I have friends that know her I will

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.000
ask her to be on the show MMT I think of

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000
as follows modern monetary theory

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000
describes the money creation process

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.000
better than conventional financial theory

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.000
and it is true that a sovereign nation

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:36.000
doesn't really need to worry about their

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000
debt because they can issue currency at

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000
will and so I think the the the water

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:50.000
works of describing treasury debt

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:56.000
taxes money creation by MMT are correct

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000
however MMT makes the same fatal flaw

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
as neoclassical economics on how it

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
treats energy productivity and

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:09.000
resources and when we create money we

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:13.000
are in balance in the world in the

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000
monetary world but we're out of balance

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000
both ecologically and specifically with

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
respect to the carbon pulse energy and

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
materials and when we create new money

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
we're not creating new copper or trees

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:32.000
or oil so I think the problem with MMT

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:35.000
is we end up at the same place with the

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:38.000
great simplification is we have

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
governments those governments that can

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
print their own money and that's another

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000
thing that gets into the inequalities

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000
and global disruptions because of using

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
the dollar as the reserve currency of

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
the world there's a lot of countries

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
that are tethered to the dollar and they

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
can't create their own dollars but we

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
can but I think we end up in the same

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
place is that we're creating too many

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
monetary claims versus an underlying

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:05.000
energy and material reality and that's

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
going to result in inflation and

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000
eventually in the lack of trust in

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.000
other countries have towards a currency

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000
as evidenced by the recent slight

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.000
downgrade in the US credit rating by

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Moody's so is that a short enough

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:26.000
overview yeah that was that was just

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000
the right length and it makes me all

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.000
the more look forward to hearing you and

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
Stephanie talk and I don't know what the

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
outcome would be but I think you know I

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.000
really appreciate talking about the

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
difference between the podcast where you

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
give space to the person you're

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
interviewing and I'm experiencing it

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
right now there's lots and lots of things

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
coming up I know I can imagine you would

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
see you're doing a great job because you

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
probably would want to be pushing back

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
on a lot of the things I'm saying it's

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
hard right because you push back on

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
everything it would be a four-hour

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:58.000
conversation there we go and you think

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
okay I'll let that go I'll let that go

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
but I'm gonna follow this thread so I

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
understand that and but here's the other

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
thing Kate is you and I are close friends

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.000
so we could go back and forth and

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
respectfully disagree with each other

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000
and learn but some of these guests I've

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.000
never met before and I had one and for

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:20.000
me to say come on are you serious to

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
someone I just met that's just not my

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000
golden retriever Midwest upbringing

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
it's really helpful to hear you articulate

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000
the reason for the franklies around on

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
right on the side and that that's a very

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
nice like your little kind of release

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000
valve on the side but yeah I was going

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000
to say I wonder if you could sometimes

01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000
invite people who you've already

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.000
interviewed or you've got to know and

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:45.000
you and just have a session we say we

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:48.000
respectfully disagree let's celebrate

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
that isn't that interesting I respect

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
you but I really disagree with your view

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
on that I just wish there was more

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000
debate in the world that just said hey

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
let's celebrate we respectfully disagree

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
let's listen and find the edges of our

01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000
own understanding without trying to

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000
win this we're all trying to move

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
forward so anyway just a thought I think

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
you could you could bring some of those

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
into the podcast in the future I'm going

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
to keep us moving so we're leaning into

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.000
the possibility of Bend and I'm looking

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.000
forward to the episode that you do in the

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.000
future with Stephanie Kelton because I

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
think and I think a lot of people would

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000
love to hear that do you know her I do

01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000
Stephanie you've got to come on this

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.000
podcast okay okay we're going to move to

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:31.000
education and you teach and are well

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:35.000
aware of the power of teaching and that

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000
moment where students are in brought into

01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:40.000
a world view so I want to know from you

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.000
if we are going to Bend at the systemic

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:46.000
level what do you think needs to change

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
in the world of education in terms of

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
the concepts that are taught in terms of

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
the kind of skills that the students

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
are taught what it means to be well

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
educated for the 21st century and you

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
can answer this across any discipline

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
you choose or even beyond academia but

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
what needs to change in the way we

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:05.000
educate this generation

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.000
almost everything needs to change and

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
just to clarify I stopped teaching three

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
years ago because I was I was just too

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
busy with other things but I did teach

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
for eight years and I miss it it was the

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
most rewarding thing I've ever done and

01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000
per my message I left you I'm happy to

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
guess lecture your your class in the

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
future

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
I'm actually trying to construct a

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
roundtable maybe you would like to be

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
part of it

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.000
Jean-Marc Giancovici and Simon Michaud

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:38.000
and Sandra Faber who's a

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:41.000
physicist and ask them how do we need

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.000
to change it the academy what are the

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
questions that we should be asking

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
postdocs and graduate students for their

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
research ahead of the great

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
simplification I think there's so many

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.000
aspects of the education system that

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000
are tethered to the super organism and

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000
energy and systems blind that we

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:05.000
really need to change

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.000
probably all levels of education I think

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
we need to start teaching ecology and

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.000
systems to grade schoolers

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000
because it by the time they get to

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:18.000
college age my my students they

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
haven't learned a lot of of these

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
basics

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:25.000
what are colleges now we were

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000
supposed to back in the day have a

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000
liberal education so that everyone

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000
understood a little bit about how the

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000
world work but over time

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000
they've morphed into came done with

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000
high school now to get a higher paying

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000
job I have to get this degree it's less

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000
about learning as it is to get a rubber

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000
stamp of I got this degree now I can

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
make 25% more money

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
and I think we're going to need more

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
education on

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
how to human how to

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
be a human

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
which includes your psychological

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
spiritual emotional physical

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
well-being

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
we don't teach that at all that's going

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
to be central in this world of

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
deteriorating mental health

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
how do we have skills that are

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
actually going to apply to

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
the future that we're headed towards

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
and how do you understand

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
the systems ecology of the world

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
sure math

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
is important

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
but you know the

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
ecology and history and brain

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
science and anthropology

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
and just

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
I mean

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
the topics I cover in my course reality

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
101 that should be kind of

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
a 101

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
for all freshmen to understand

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
the world we face

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
so

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
and to go right back to where we began

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
with energy blindness I guess

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
you'd say there's got to be an energy

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
what eyes wide open

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
education that everybody should

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
learn to

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
see sense and be aware

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
of

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
deep dependence upon the flows of energy in the

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
world because it's if it's the currency of life

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
we better get with it

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
yeah

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I mean

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
one of the complaints

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
my students complained to

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
me and to the dean that at the end

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
of the semester I taught them all kinds

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
of things about how the world worked and how

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
messed up it was but I didn't

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
give an answer

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
and they were paid

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
to learn and have the answer

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
but I didn't have an answer and he was very upset

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
about that

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
I don't think there are answers

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
but we have to empower young

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
people with

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
not a rose tinted

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
but an actual view of our reality

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
to

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
in a way that we pass the baton to them

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
in an encouraging and empowering way

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
to do things

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
but I do think it's a disservice

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
to

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
shovel the uncomfortable aspects under the

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
carpet and ignore them because they're too

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
young and they can't handle that

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
I don't subscribe to that

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
and just picking up on that question of

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
you didn't give an answer

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000
I mean I've heard you say before

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
also in relation to this podcast

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000
and in relation to

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.000
the world view you bring forward

01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000
it's more, I said

01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000
I experience it more as a

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000
this is what I see

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:20.000
this is the context I see

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000
I'm trying to explain the system

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
that I see that we're in

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:26.000
but you sit much more there

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
and here's how I think we should solve it

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000
is that a fair description

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
of the place in this ecosystem

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
of making things visible

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000
and the solution to sit

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000
Yes, but if you squint

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.000
and look forward

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
it's kind of obvious

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
what the direction of the things

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
we're going to need to do and a lot of the things

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
are in your work

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000
on the donut

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000
we're going to need to live

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
instead of just as individual

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000
lone wolves we're going to have to

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
expand our interaction

01:30:58.000 --> 01:31:00.000
with others social capital is

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:02.000
critically important

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.000
and we're going to have to

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
probably have less

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:08.000
material consumption

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000
and how to prepare for that ahead of time

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000
and prepare for that in your communities

01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000
I mean how we get from here

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
to there could happen multiple

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
different ways

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000
next week I have

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000
a round table on poverty

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
and I think

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
there's great inequality

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000
in the world between countries

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.000
but there's even larger inequality

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:32.000
in countries including my country

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
and your country

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
and I think that's going to be a huge

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
story in the next decade

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:40.000
is the amount of

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
haves

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
the amount of have nots

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.000
is going to increase a lot

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
we're going to have wider and deeper poverty

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000
and of course we'll try to

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:52.000
overcome that

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:54.000
with stimulus and social

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.000
programs but eventually there will be limits

01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000
to that so how do we

01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
where does college fit in

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.000
with that? Is it even the best

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.000
choice

01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:06.000
for an 18 year old

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
headed into this world

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
but yeah you're right I'm more

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000
trying to describe our situation

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.000
in a politically neutral

01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000
science tethered way

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
and pass that

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
baton to as many humans that

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
will listen

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:24.000
which is another issue Kate

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:26.000
this podcast is not for everyone

01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:28.000
I could

01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:30.000
with more funding

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.000
broadcast it so that I paid

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
for social media views and got

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.000
a lot more people to watch it

01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.000
and this is not a message

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
for everyone that is

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000
I want to force on people

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000
it's kind of a low bandwidth

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000
bat signal that I'm sending out to the world

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000
and those people that resonate

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000
with it

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000
those are my sort of people

01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000
and I want to be as honest as I can

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.000
be in what I think

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.000
with them there's a completely

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000
different set of messaging

01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000
that needs to happen

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000
for the general public, for students

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000
for community leaders, for Hollywood

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000
for governments

01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000
and that's more than I can handle

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.000
at the moment but messaging

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.000
is very important

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
and I'm just trying to be

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
authentic and describe

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.000
what I see now

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000
and maybe I should do more thought

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000
in crafting

01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:26.000
discrete pathways

01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.000
that are helpful to people

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:30.000
and of course there are people

01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:32.000
among students and community leaders

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000
and Hollywood and political leaders

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
who are your listeners of this podcast

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
and maybe they are also

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
taking it and translating it

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
or making it accessible to their communities

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
in ways that only they

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
from within that community know

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
how that will fly

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
that actually is my deepest hope

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
is that I don't know

01:33:52.000 --> 01:33:54.000
how these conversations

01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:56.000
are changing the actions and behaviors

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000
and emergence of others

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
I do have another call, a second call next week

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
with an executive at HBO

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
that wants to do a series

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
on the great simplification

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
writ large, like a six part series

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000
and we're kind of talking

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000
about what that might look like

01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000
so yeah, the time now

01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:16.000
is for this cultural conversation

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000
and it's not just climate

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
and it's not just

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000
politics, it's

01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000
a large

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
systems, human

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
species level

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
conversation

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
and

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
you and I are part of that

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
conversation and it's evolving

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
and I'm going to break around

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.000
to ways that we could lean

01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:42.000
into the possibility of Bend

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000
okay, you've shared what you'd say

01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000
about changing education, what about changing

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:48.000
and this is massively broad

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
but what about changing

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.000
policy making

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.000
just think of policy makers

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:56.000
in

01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:58.000
a country, I'm going to start with a country

01:34:58.000 --> 01:35:00.000
in the global north

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000
they're involved in

01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000
industry or sector

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000
that is material and energy intensive

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.000
and they came to you and said

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:12.000
how can I start

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:14.000
changing to help Bend

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
what can I

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.000
think differently, do different tools, language

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.000
world view

01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.000
I know this is a massive question

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000
what can you see that could start

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
helping if there was

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
if we believe that this couldn't fail then critical

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
mass could actually build amongst policy makers

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
what would you want to see a critical mass

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
of building

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
it is a massive question

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
in fact every question you've

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
asked me could be its own one hour

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
podcast

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
I've included that

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
policies that actually could

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
be implemented right now

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
are only at the margin

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
the conversation that needs to happen

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
is so, so much bigger

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
on what we're going to have to do in the next decade

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
so I coined the phrase

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
advanced policy which is those things

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
that we will have to do

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
but that are politically and

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
socially unacceptable now

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
and so the biggest thing

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
is to educate

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
the current leaders and future leaders

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
as possible about how

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
these pieces fit together

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
and

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
build constituency and research

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
and work on what

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
they will have to do

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
when we go into energy

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
security and rationing

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
and

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
the early stages of the simplification

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
in the global north now that's

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
a different answer for corporations

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
and businesses

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
that would have more to do with

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
I mean here's the thing

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
we

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
so revere efficiency today

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
but

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
efficiency makes things less resilient

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
and

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
on the downslope once the economy

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
starts to decline

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
efficiency

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
the Jevons paradox will become a Jevons

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
dividend because if we

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
get 5% more

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
efficiency in how we use energy

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
that means whatever our

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
decline is is 5% less

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
so

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
the challenge now is

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
to look two or three steps ahead

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
on what are the technologies

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
that society are going to need

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
in the next 10 or 20 years

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
and start

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
looking at that instead

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
of what consumers are demanding now

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
but how do you do that

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
I mean it's really hard

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
because your market is what

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
people are buying today

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
so I come back to

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
education

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
and systems

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
are the no regret strategies

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
and I mean you're doing fantastic

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
work with deal

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
and donut on the ground

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
in cities

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
I just don't see that we're going to

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
get off of

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
fossil carbon because of ammonia

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
and cement and

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
concrete and fertilizers and all the

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
other things

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
but to prepare for less

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
and less intricate global

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
supply chains

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
is something to be considered

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
I've talked to a lot of politicians

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
and this is like too big

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
of a thing for them to bite off

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
so

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
but I think it

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
five years ago this sounded crazy

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
and now they're nodding their heads

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
starting to listen

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
is there anything that you think

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
people are already doing

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
right

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
towards

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
bending

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:40.000
at least that's in motion

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
at least that's building mass

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
well I think psychologically

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
there are millions

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
or tens of millions of people

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
that are already

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.000
the walking worried that

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
know that our culture is approaching

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:56.000
an inflection point

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.000
and so they're

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000
supportive

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.000
they're doing things

01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.000
more locally

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:06.000
they're meeting their neighbors

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
they're maybe growing a little food

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:10.000
I mean this is without understanding

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:12.000
climate change or oil depletion

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000
or debt overshoot or anything

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000
they're just

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000
responding

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
from the cultural signals

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
I mean you're probably a better person

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
to ask that question

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
look at all the on the ground

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I think that the biggest thing

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
is that we're starting to talk

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
about this in lots

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
of different places

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
and that talking kind of breaks the seal

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
of creativity

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
and working together

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
and different

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
different projects

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
it's just that little flame

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
is so tiny relative

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
to the media and

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
the cultural conversation

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
and the Super Bowl

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
and the advertising on TV

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
that you need to buy

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
this extra little thing

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
for your house and you'll be happy

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
so I think

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
many of us are growing up

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
and waking up

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
to our reality

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
and

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
I think that itself is a good thing

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
and needs to continue to scale

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
by the way

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
this is

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
this is

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
a darker conversation

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
than I anticipated

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
is it not

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
it feels like I'm kind of a curmudgeon

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
here

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
I'm not trying to put you in a curmudgeon corner

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
I'm inviting you

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
to talk about the possibility of bend

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
yeah well

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
but that's where you okay

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
that's interesting that's where you are today

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
yeah it's where I am today

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
but I mean I also

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
who am I

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
Kate to tell

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
people how I think

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
that what they should do

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I also

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
feel like

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
I do understand how the system

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
fits together and I've spent a lot of time

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
on biophysical economics

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
but that doesn't qualify me to be some

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
advice person

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
for people's lives

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
I know the general direction

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
because I'm still

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
trying to figure out what to do in my own life

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
okay

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
I'm just going to pick up

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
there something I was going to bring later

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
who might

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
be an advice person

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
and I hear you saying

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
I'm witnessing I'm just saying what I'm seeing

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
but I don't want to be giving advice

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
but I'm going to come back to

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
I want to come into the place of the difference between

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
the podcast and the franklies

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
and you've explained a little bit

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
quite clearly actually the difference

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000
and the reason for both and that makes sense

01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000
to me

01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000
but your franklies are sometimes very strong

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000
like very strong opinion

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000
and you might not be giving advice

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
but the strength in which

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:58.000
with which you give your opinion

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.000
influences people

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:02.000
and it shapes

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000
many people's

01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.000
perception of what is or isn't possible

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:08.000
so it has a big effect in the world

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.000
and I just want to

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000
lean into that a little bit more

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000
to ask you

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000
to hold that

01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:18.000
this is my opinion

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
and you know that you've got a big audience

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
this is my opinion and sometimes

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.000
for many people it can feel very dark

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.000
like well we're just going to keep using the oil

01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:28.000
whereas so many people are

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:30.000
mobilizing in every way they can

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
to move us off that

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
and to move us into not renewables

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:36.000
but solar based energies

01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.000
it feels very

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.000
heavy

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
to hear you say

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
keep using it up

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:46.000
and I just want to ask you how you hold

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:48.000
knowing that it is influential

01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:50.000
and it might not be advocacy and advising

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.000
but it has impact on

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:54.000
people's sense of what's possible

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.000
I do have a strong opinion

01:42:56.000 --> 01:42:58.000
of the global macro

01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:00.000
economy

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:02.000
and I actually don't think that

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:04.000
the tragedy is we're going to use

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.000
more oil

01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:08.000
per se I think it's

01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.000
the economy unwinding

01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:12.000
to prepare for

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:14.000
and we are going to use less oil

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:16.000
because we won't be able to afford it

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:18.000
I think that's the default path

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:20.000
the franklies

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:24.000
if I had my druthers

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:26.000
I would do one a day

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
and I have hundreds of topics

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
that I would like to

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:32.000
opine on

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:34.000
and it's interesting Kate

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.000
something really strange has happened

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.000
since I started doing these franklies

01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:40.000
I go for like a bike ride

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:42.000
or a walk

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:44.000
and I organize things in my head

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:46.000
and I come back right here

01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000
and I turn the camera on and I just riff

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000
and 9 times out of 10 that's the final thing

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.000
and sometimes I say something

01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:54.000
and my staff is like no you can't say that

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.000
you need to redo it

01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:58.000
but I've gotten better at speaking

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.000
in like 15 minute

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.000
extemp summaries

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:04.000
but I can no longer write

01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:06.000
I've lost the ability to

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:08.000
dense those thoughts into

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:10.000
you know

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000
1500 word essay

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:14.000
and so this

01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:16.000
it's like working out certain muscles

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.000
I've been talking on this

01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000
podcast and these franklies

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.000
but I think the franklies

01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:24.000
at their core

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:26.000
are a systems integration

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.000
of multiple topics

01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.000
that I've spent 20 years thinking

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
about and researching

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:34.000
and talking to other experts

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:36.000
and so it's where the disciplines

01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
overlap

01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:40.000
and merge is where the discovery

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:42.000
and interesting things are

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:44.000
okay

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.000
here's a question you invited me to ask

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:48.000
which I appreciate

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:50.000
where might you be wrong

01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.000
I asked you to ask me that

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.000
yeah you did

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:58.000
I think I want to start asking that of all my guests

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.000
you absolutely should

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.000
I think that's a great idea

01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:04.000
um

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.000
when I ran

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:10.000
the oil drum and now that

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.000
I run this podcast I get emails

01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.000
from so many people

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.000
that are all so

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000
unbelievably sure about

01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.000
their world view

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:22.000
and I think it's part of the human condition

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:24.000
especially with

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.000
middle-aged and older men

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:28.000
that they have this

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.000
unbelievable certitude

01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:32.000
of their world view and their opinion

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
and I think that is part of the human condition

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.000
and I'm a middle-aged

01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:38.000
older man and therefore

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:40.000
I have to recognizing that

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.000
handicap my certitude by some amount

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:44.000
I feel

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:46.000
confident about these things

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:48.000
but I know that humans are

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:50.000
oftentimes delusional

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000
and don't actually see

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000
things that they can't see

01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.000
so I'm sure that I'm wrong

01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.000
about many many

01:46:00.000 --> 01:46:02.000
things in what I'm talking

01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:04.000
about at the

01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:06.000
margin because I'm trying to stay on top

01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.000
of neuroscience and plastics

01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.000
and oil depletion and things

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:12.000
are moving so fast that I can't

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.000
stay up

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
on the core things I really don't think

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
I'm wrong because I've

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
looked at them so many times

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
humans are biological

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
organisms were

01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:26.000
mammals were primates were

01:46:26.000 --> 01:46:28.000
predators were related to

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
all other things

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
that are alive on the planet

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:34.000
and we're a product of our evolutionary

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:36.000
past and that has a bearing on our behaviors

01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:38.000
I don't think

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:40.000
I'm wrong about that energy is

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.000
the currency of life and how much

01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000
net energy we have access to

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:46.000
dictates what's possible

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:48.000
in the human sphere and this

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:50.000
energy that we've been using

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.000
is depleting

01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:54.000
and we've been

01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.000
alive during a part where it was

01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.000
growing not depleting

01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:00.000
and so we're

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.000
immune to the imagination of

01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:04.000
what can happen afterward I don't know

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
what's going to happen afterward

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:08.000
but I can infer it

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:10.000
and most importantly

01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:12.000
the natural world

01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.000
is being

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:16.000
severely impacted by the human

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.000
endeavor and

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:20.000
this is kind of a shifting baseline

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.000
sort of thing we don't see it

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.000
every day every day looks much like

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
yesterday but over decades and over

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
centuries it is absolutely

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:30.000
deteriorating

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:32.000
relative to the way it was

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:34.000
I don't think I'm wrong

01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:36.000
about those larger

01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:38.000
arcs

01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:40.000
but I definitely could be wrong about some

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:42.000
things for instance what is the role of

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.000
technology

01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:46.000
what is the role of governance

01:47:46.000 --> 01:47:48.000
what is the role of cultural evolution

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:50.000
I don't think I'm

01:47:50.000 --> 01:47:52.000
really wrong about those things because

01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:54.000
I'm not deterministic in what they will

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:56.000
be

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.000
I am

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:00.000
still learning Kate

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000
aren't we all

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000
and since you talked about

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.000
your own identity

01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:10.000
in this I'm just going to come in on that

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:12.000
here's me a white British woman sitting at

01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Oxford in the United Kingdom

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000
and there's you

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000
white presenting North American man

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:20.000
in the US

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.000
what do you think

01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:24.000
that there may be

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:26.000
things that people like you and I can't

01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000
see that are trends in the world

01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.000
that matter in the world

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:32.000
just some reflections on what

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.000
other people dissimilar

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:36.000
from us might know or be able

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:38.000
to see or sense that we can't see

01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.000
now that's a kind of tricky question

01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:42.000
tell me what you can see that you can't see

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:44.000
but you get where I'm going

01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:46.000
fortunately I have a lot of friends

01:48:46.000 --> 01:48:48.000
internationally many of them

01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:50.000
have been guests in this show and I hope to do

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.000
more international

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.000
guests in next year

01:48:54.000 --> 01:48:56.000
that this

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000
everyone has a different

01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.000
perspective and what they care about

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:02.000
is different and I think we need to hear

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.000
a lot more

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:06.000
voices on how people

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:08.000
process this and how they respond

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.000
to it this is one

01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.000
of my biggest challenges right now there's

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
38% of the listeners of this

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000
show are in the United States

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000
which means 62%

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.000
are in other countries

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
I live in the

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000
United States my social connections

01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:26.000
are largely here when I talk

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:28.000
about bend versus break

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:30.000
and the great simplification

01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:32.000
ostensibly I mean for this

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.000
country because we are

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000
totally unprepared for what's coming

01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000
and yet there are people

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000
in Kenya and Ethiopia

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000
and Lebanon

01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000
and Ukraine listening

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
and watching this podcast I know

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000
because they email me

01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.000
and the message for them might be totally

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:52.000
different than the message for people

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.000
living in Minneapolis or Topeka, Kansas

01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.000
and so I

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.000
really struggle with that

01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:00.000
and I want to stay on

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:02.000
target of how does this

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.000
system science fit together

01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:06.000
of our predicament

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000
and what are the behavioral policy

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:10.000
economic

01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.000
and biological ways out of it

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:14.000
but I also want to

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:16.000
like you said I want to highlight

01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:18.000
the voices that can

01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.000
see things about this that

01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.000
a biophysical economist could not

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:24.000
and I'll need help

01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:26.000
on finding those voices

01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.000
but I hear you

01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:30.000
on that

01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000
Yeah and just reflecting that

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:34.000
for my own economics education

01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:36.000
economics was founded on the

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
worldviews of

01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:40.000
people from the global north with land

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:42.000
and so they saw some things

01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:44.000
and they missed a heck of a lot of things

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.000
and in my own

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:48.000
rethinking of economics

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:50.000
it's been when you go to other people

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:52.000
from the global south from women's voices

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:54.000
from working class backgrounds

01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:56.000
people who come from elsewhere

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.000
where those economists where they just bring

01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:00.000
that 360 degree completely other perspective

01:51:00.000 --> 01:51:02.000
and as you said earlier

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000
like none of us can know

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:06.000
everything none of us can see everything

01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.000
it takes that ecosystem

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:10.000
of using experience to help

01:51:10.000 --> 01:51:12.000
fill in the gaps

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:14.000
of our own understanding

01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.000
our ability to empathize or learn

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:18.000
about other places so

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:20.000
here's to ecosystems of knowledge

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.000
and podcasts right back to the value of a podcast

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:24.000
just so many different voices

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.000
I can definitely think

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:28.000
of people you could invite on

01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:30.000
who would bring much more of that perspective

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000
and I'm sure many of your listeners can too

01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000
so

01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:36.000
can you move us towards the classic closing questions

01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:38.000
okay the questions that you

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000
ask people every week

01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:42.000
and make sense to ask them to you

01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:44.000
are you ready

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:46.000
yes

01:51:46.000 --> 01:51:48.000
okay

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000
what would be

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000
a practical response to the metacrisis

01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:54.000
that would be most effective

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:56.000
for people to take

01:52:00.000 --> 01:52:02.000
Nate that's a really big question

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:04.000
do you ask people that

01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000
just like straight off the bat

01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000
do you feel how massive that is

01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:18.000
well this is why I do that

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000
is because

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:22.000
everyone has a factual

01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:24.000
expertise Helen Thompson

01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.000
was on last week talking about

01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:28.000
money and energy

01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000
and geopolitics

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000
and she gets asked those personal things

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:34.000
and I frankly don't know what she thinks

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.000
about the great simplification

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.000
other than she specifically

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:40.000
predicts energy

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:42.000
security problems

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:44.000
in the next five years

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:46.000
so I like to

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:48.000
I mean my belief is

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:50.000
we're headed for a time

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.000
when we need to have

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000
the head, the heart and the hands

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:56.000
acting in unison

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.000
and so much of the podcast

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:00.000
sphere is about the head

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000
you know analyzing things

01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:04.000
so I

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
append these questions

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:08.000
at the end of the interviews

01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000
to get at the heart

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:12.000
of the human that is on the show

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:14.000
nice

01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:16.000
because I think our humanity

01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.000
and

01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:20.000
our honesty and our care

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:22.000
and who we are as individuals

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:24.000
is going to be as

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:26.000
or even more important than the facts

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.000
we know about the world

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:30.000
so that's why I asked those

01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000
and I'm thinking about mixing them up

01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.000
a little because it's been a hundred episodes

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.000
but

01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000
we do get really interesting

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000
answers

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000
what do we do about the metacrisis

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000
it depends where you are

01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:46.000
I think the I mean I have a hundred

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.000
pieces of advice

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000
but the main one

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000
is

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000
try to not go through

01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000
this

01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:58.000
as an individual

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.000
find a group of like-minded people

01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:02.000
on your values

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:04.000
find a group of like-minded people

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:06.000
on

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
doing things

01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:10.000
meeting the future halfway in your community

01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.000
or in your company

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.000
or in your neighborhood

01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:16.000
and find a group of people that

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.000
you like to have fun with

01:54:18.000 --> 01:54:20.000
and do things that are unrelated to the metacrisis

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000
and feed your soul

01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:24.000
those groups, those three groups

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
end up being the same group of five or six

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.000
or seven friends or maybe they're different

01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000
but finding

01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.000
the dining car on this

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.000
runaway train

01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.000
with like-minded people

01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:38.000
is an important thing to do

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:42.000
one of my problems is

01:54:42.000 --> 01:54:44.000
I eat, sleep and breathe

01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:46.000
the metacrisis, my girlfriend now

01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.000
I have a rule that if I'm on the phone call

01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.000
with

01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:52.000
a group of people

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:54.000
Daniel or

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:56.000
DJ White or Rex Weiler

01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:58.000
or Art Berman

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000
I have to leave the house

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000
she's tired of hearing about this stuff

01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000
and I don't blame her

01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:06.000
so

01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.000
try to have balance as well

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:10.000
and I think

01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:12.000
there's a lot of things that are out of our control

01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.000
so that means

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.000
try to control one or two things

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:18.000
about your future

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.000
and I try to do that

01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:22.000
and I think ultimately

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000
where we are as a culture

01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:26.000
what

01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:28.000
really needs to change is a culture

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:30.000
which is to

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:32.000
recognize that most of this consumption

01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.000
is

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:36.000
not making us healthy

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:38.000
or happy

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:40.000
and that once basic needs

01:55:40.000 --> 01:55:42.000
are met the best things in life

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:44.000
are mostly free

01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:46.000
and for a lot of people the basic needs aren't being met

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.000
if we look at the macro things

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.000
of what our society needs to do

01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:52.000
we can start

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.000
to attempt to try to change those things

01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.000
in our own life and you see how

01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:58.000
difficult it is

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:00.000
to reduce the

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.000
siren song

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:04.000
of immediate gratification

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:06.000
with either food or entertainment

01:56:06.000 --> 01:56:08.000
or novelty or stimulus

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.000
and do the longer term

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:12.000
thing like reading a book

01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.000
or planting something or tending a garden

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.000
and so

01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:18.000
if we really want to live more sustainably

01:56:18.000 --> 01:56:20.000
as a culture I think that

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:22.000
starts within

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.000
and that's a struggle for me

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:26.000
that I'm going through all the time

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.000
so

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.000
I'm sure people have heard me talk a lot

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.000
about what I recommend

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:34.000
and I'll have more stuff but that's a

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:36.000
short response

01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:38.000
Okay and specifically what recommendations

01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:40.000
for young humans

01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:42.000
who are becoming aware of this

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:44.000
and may have stumbled across

01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:46.000
this podcast had it recommended

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.000
by a teacher by a friend

01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.000
suddenly burst into this

01:56:50.000 --> 01:56:52.000
awareness

01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.000
of this world that was probably not centered

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.000
to their education and here they are

01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:58.000
Do you use the word young humans or were you just mimicking me?

01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.000
You use the word young humans

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:02.000
What do you say young people?

01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:04.000
Young people but you know let's go with young humans

01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.000
Okay

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.000
Young humans

01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.000
keep learning

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:14.000
find

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.000
like-minded people to travel

01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
like I just said

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
find

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
things that you're really interested

01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.000
in and care about

01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:26.000
learn skills

01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.000
that would be useful

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:30.000
imagine the great simplification

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:32.000
happening

01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000
in your community

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.000
what would you want to be

01:57:36.000 --> 01:57:38.000
involved in and responsible for

01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000
and partake in and start

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000
thinking about that

01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:46.000
The world will probably be

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
worse than many of us

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
expect but probably a lot

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
better than many of us fear

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:54.000
and don't let fear

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.000
dominate your life

01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.000
I'm trying to

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:00.000
with this podcast

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
give a broad arc of

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000
what's happening and

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000
if you just happen upon a podcast

01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000
without knowing all the back

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000
story leading up to it

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000
it can be a little overwhelming

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000
and my best advice for that is

01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.000
listen to it or process it

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:18.000
with a group of other people

01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:20.000
or a friend

01:58:20.000 --> 01:58:22.000
and talk about it

01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000
talk about these things

01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000
get out in nature and get off your phone

01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000
as much as possible

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000
those will be some of the pieces of advice

01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000
Nice

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
How can listeners reshape the way

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000
they think

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000
in order to best face the future

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000
I don't think we can change

01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000
human behavior not on a dime

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000
I think we can shift

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000
we can create

01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:50.000
we can use our cognitive skills

01:58:50.000 --> 01:58:52.000
to

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000
create speed bumps

01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000
in the future for the ghost

01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000
of dopamine past and our emotional

01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000
proclivities

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000
I think we can change how we think

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000
via

01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000
awareness

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000
and meditation

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000
and having a little Kate or a little Nate

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000
on our shoulder chiming in

01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000
and observing and commenting

01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000
on what we're doing

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000
and

01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000
try to find people that

01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000
disagree with you and steal man

01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000
their arguments and then

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000
come back to

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000
what you originally thought

01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000
and you might have a deeper appreciation

01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000
of the topic

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000
and keep thinking in systems

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
on how things

01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000
fit together

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000
but don't all only think

01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000
I mean thinking is part of the problem

01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000
that we're always just thinking

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
we have to also live

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
in the moment

01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
We are now heading home woods

01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:52.000
Are you ready?

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:54.000
What do you care about most?

01:59:56.000 --> 01:59:58.000
What do you think I care about most?

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.000
What are you asking you?

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:02.000
I care about the natural world

02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:04.000
and other species

02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:06.000
that have no voice in our economic system

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.000
or on

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:10.000
the bend or break scenario

02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:12.000
and

02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.000
this

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.000
still is the only planet

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000
that we are certain

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000
has life and complex life

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000
in the whole universe

02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000
and this

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000
slowly unfolding

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000
you know

02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000
metacrisis

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000
has a large

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000
back-ended cost

02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000
on the natural world

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000
and I care mostly about that

02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000
I care about a lot of things which is

02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000
part of the cross

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000
that I bear with this work

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000
but I care about other species

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000
insects, birds, mammals

02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000
trees, forests

02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000
at the end of the day

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000
that's what I care about most

02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000
And especially dogs

02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000
Yeah

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000
I care about dogs a lot

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000
I've seen you with dogs, I've seen dogs passing in the street

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000
and you just like

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000
a whole other Nate comes out

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000
everything else has swept away

02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000
there's a doggy on the pavement

02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000
we're going to put the dogs aside a moment

02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000
come back

02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000
what is one thing you worry about

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000
for the next 10 years?

02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000
Well of course I would answer that

02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000
every day

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000
but I think the thing that

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000
worries me the most

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000
is what I care about the most

02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000
is the natural world

02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000
and I think

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000
we are approaching this

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000
cultural awakening moment

02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000
of concern

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000
for the biosphere and climate

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000
and oceans and other species

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000
and it's growing in the media

02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000
and I think that could be

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000
upended by

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000
energy scarcity, energy poverty

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000
and economic problems

02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000
and a rightward shift politically around the world

02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000
and that all of this

02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000
burgeoning

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000
environmental awareness

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000
is going to go to the

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000
back burner

02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000
in our cultural focus

02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000
and it will become more dangerous

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000
to outwardly

02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000
talk about these things

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000
relative to today

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000
that's one of the things that I worry about

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000
not only because

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000
I have a podcast about nature

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000
and systems but because

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000
now is the time that that needs

02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000
to be prominent in our decisions

02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000
because ultimately

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000
what's best for nature

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000
and ecosystems is also

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000
best for humans in the long run.

02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000
Indeed.

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000
What is one thing you have hope

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000
about over the next 10 years?

02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000
I have hope

02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000
in conversations like this

02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000
and I told you this in Sweden

02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000
is there are so many

02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000
pro-social

02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000
smart people

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
that are starting to get it

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000
and starting to put things together

02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000
and starting to ask how do I change things

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000
at my university, at my company

02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000
I've been giving presentations to

02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000
corporations

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
that want to understand

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
how this affects their business

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
so we have arrived at

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000
how all these things fit together

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000
and it's really politically

02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000
and socially difficult

02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000
to say these things out loud

02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000
but it's starting

02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000
and that gives me hope

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000
is these conversations are becoming

02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000
less BS and

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000
more

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000
tethered to reality

02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000
that's a little scary but it's also hopeful

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000
that we're going to have

02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000
an emergent response to some of these

02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000
events on the horizon.

02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000
If you could

02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000
wave a magic wand

02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000
with no personal recourse

02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000
to do one thing to improve the

02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000
future

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000
what would you wave it at?

02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000
So the reason I

02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000
phrased that question that way

02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000
is waving a magic wand with no personal

02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000
recourse

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000
is different than being a president

02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000
or a prime minister

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000
because a president and a prime minister

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000
could have a

02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000
dictum or a policy

02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000
but they're still beholden to their

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
constituents who voted them

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000
and could vote them out.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000
A magic wand

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000
presumably is do whatever

02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000
you want

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000
and it doesn't matter what other people think.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000
You could go for dictator too but I quite like

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000
the magic wand alternative.

02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000
I would

02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000
change

02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000
how people

02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000
change the lens

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000
with which they view

02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000
their own lives and their existence to a

02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000
wider boundary one

02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000
and view that everything is connected

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000
and that we're part of

02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000
this long

02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000
evolving

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000
social biological

02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000
experiment that brought us

02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000
to this moment and to care

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000
beyond

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000
their own tiny sphere

02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000
into caring about other people

02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000
other generations and ecosystems

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000
and I think a lot more things

02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000
would be possible if we expanded

02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000
the lens

02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000
of where we

02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000
measure our own boundaries of the self.

02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000
If you had, I'm going to give you six months

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000
just

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000
open up a little

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000
window in the fabric of

02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000
time and you just get this

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000
pocket of six months to dive

02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000
into one topic and explore it

02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000
however you want, what are you going to dive into?

02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000
The human brain

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
and how to

02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000
quiet down

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000
the dopamine consumption

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000
treadmill that we're on

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000
and to heal

02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000
and come from a place of

02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:56.000
equanimity

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:58.000
and view

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:00.000
the purpose of

02:06:00.000 --> 02:06:02.000
one's life and one's work

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:04.000
towards the betterment of the future

02:06:04.000 --> 02:06:06.000
rather than

02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:08.000
individual

02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:10.000
dopamine cascades

02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000
and social status

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:14.000
and monetary piles of digits

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
and

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
really what would that take

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
from a neuroscience

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:22.000
slash cultural

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.000
slash sociological perspective

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000
to heal more humans

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000
and

02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000
involve them in a

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
purpose for the greater good

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
given the challenges we face.

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000
Is there any question I haven't asked you

02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000
that you're now thinking, oh, I really wish there was

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000
this question in the podcast that she'd asked me

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
because I actually want to answer that.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000
No, this is

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000
this has been great.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000
I'm going to carry on with this.

02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000
It feels

02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000
like it's

02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000
something that I was supposed to do

02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000
which is my kind of Midwest

02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000
you know

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000
golden retriever

02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000
sort of personality interviewing

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000
scientists and activists

02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000
on what we face

02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:12.000
and then peppering in the franklies

02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:14.000
to give kind of a

02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:16.000
goofy color commentary on some

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:18.000
aspect.

02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:20.000
I hope it continues

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:22.000
to scale and that

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:24.000
it's inspiring

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:26.000
others to have these

02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:28.000
conversations at their dinner table

02:07:28.000 --> 02:07:30.000
at their town meeting or at their

02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:32.000
their companies

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
and

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:36.000
if it happens

02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:38.000
and there's an episode 200

02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:40.000
I may invite you back to

02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:42.000
interview me again. Boy, what a world

02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:44.000
will be at that point.

02:07:44.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Fantastic, thank you very much

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:48.000
and again, of course, this is my show this week

02:07:48.000 --> 02:07:50.000
so thank you very much, Nate

02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:52.000
Hagans. It's been fantastic having you

02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:54.000

02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Simplification.

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:58.000
That's all for this week and now

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:00.000
we go to the theme music.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:06.000
