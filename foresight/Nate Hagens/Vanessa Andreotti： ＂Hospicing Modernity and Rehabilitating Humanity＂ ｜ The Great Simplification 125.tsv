0	7000	The condition, desire to look for simplistic solutions that make us feel and look good,
7000	12000	but they do not address the root causes of our predicament.
12000	20000	So, in that sense, we are kind of unprepared to face the magnitude, the depth and the scale of the problem,
20000	25000	and that takes us back to education, what education can do.
25000	36000	So, if education has been part of the problem, how can and what kind of education could help us through a different form of coexistence?
39000	45000	Today's guest is Vanessa Andriati, who is the Dean of the Faculty of Education
45000	50000	at the University of British Columbia at Victoria on Vancouver Island.
50000	59000	Today, we discuss Vanessa's work on projects related to global justice and citizenship, indigenous knowledge systems,
59000	68000	and nature, as well as her book Hospicing Modernity, Facing Humanities Wrongs and the Implication for Social Activism.
68000	76000	When discussing the Metacrisis, sometimes it can be difficult to see alternative paths out of the challenges we face.
76000	83000	Vanessa is one of the leading thinkers towards alternative ways of learning and living.
83000	87000	I hope you enjoy this conversation with Vanessa Andriati.
87000	89000	Oh, Vanessa.
89000	90000	Hi Nate.
90000	91000	Great to see you.
91000	92000	Good to see you.
92000	94000	You too, you too.
94000	103000	You are one of the most requested podcast guests in our inbox over the last six months,
103000	107000	and here we are finally after two reschedules.
107000	110000	So, welcome.
110000	111000	Thank you.
111000	112000	Very happy to be here.
112000	115000	So, lots to discuss.
115000	123000	So, let's start at your recent well-known book, Hospicing Modernity.
123000	127000	I am constantly reminded and pointed to it.
127000	132000	Can you just start out by defining what you mean by modernity?
132000	138000	Maybe give us a guided tour on what the house that modernity built looks like.
138000	140000	Sure.
140000	144000	So, first of all, I think I need to start with a land acknowledgement.
144000	150000	And it's a land acknowledgement that is not necessarily the usual one.
150000	157000	It's a land acknowledgement that acknowledges the land as a living entity, not a resource or property.
158000	174000	It's also land acknowledgement that acknowledges our ancestors, both past and future ancestors and the responsibilities we have towards both, including the responsibility to correct mistakes of past ancestors.
174000	181000	There's also the acknowledgement that we're here as a result of a system of violence.
181000	200000	And if we're thinking about all the minerals that have been mined in places for us to be here today, being able to have this conversation, we also have a responsibility there to acknowledge the costs and the externalized costs,
200000	203000	both on the land and for the people of that violence.
203000	214000	And the last acknowledgement is the acknowledgement that we're all related, so entangled within a much wider metabolism.
214000	224000	That is the planet that is currently under a lot of distress, including the distress caused to the indigenous communities.
224000	232000	If you're in a settler colonial country like I am, in what's known as Canada, we also need to acknowledge the indigenous people of the land.
232000	239000	In this case, the Songhis and the Squimalt in other Lakwangan-speaking nations who have a connection with this land.
239000	262000	So with all of this preamble, I think the preamble also shows where I'm going with what I generally say in the book, in terms of a critique of the system, not only of thought but of effect and
262000	267000	relationality that we have inherited from the past.
267000	279000	I gave the name modernity, and in the book, we talk about modernity as a who rather than a what, so that we can understand stories in its leaving dimension.
279000	288000	And in the book, we talk about modernity as a story that is expiring because its promises are no longer credible.
288000	294000	They were unrealistic from the outside, they are perceived as broken, but they are no longer credible.
294000	303000	And it's the promise in the book, we talk about the house to bring all the elements of modernity as an entity together.
303000	309000	So it's the house that is sitting on the planet, and the house is exceeding the limits of the planet.
309000	317000	And that makes reference to the planetary boundaries reached and of shooting the limits of the planet.
317000	328000	So this house, the story of the house is that the house has a foundation of what we call separability, which is the separation of humans from the rest of nature.
328000	345000	And this separability creates lots of problems, but one of them is that it removes the intrinsic value of life and creates the conditions for us to be feeling worthless in a sense and needing an external validation
345000	355000	so that by participating in the economies within the house, the economies of modernity, we get that sense of value and that sense of worth.
355000	361000	So you have to be producing value in order to be worthy of being alive.
361000	370000	The separability also creates lots of hierarchies between species, between cultures, between individuals.
370000	380000	And that sense of separation, that simple sense of separation also causes neurobiological impairments.
380000	388000	So it prevents us from sensing or experiencing reality as interconnected and entangled with other beings.
388000	398000	And if we don't experience reality like that, we will neglect and deny our responsibilities for that entanglement.
398000	401000	So that's just the foundation of the house.
401000	414000	Then we identified two carrying walls as well of the house and the first carrying wall would be a carrying wall of the modern nation state, which we tend to associate with the protection of its constituency of people.
414000	424000	However, if you look at the history of the modern nation state, it was created to protect property and to protect property owners.
424000	438000	And if we look at the dispensation of rights like human rights, labor rights, indigenous rights, they usually happen when there's interest convergence between the protection of capital and the protection of people.
438000	446000	When there is no interest convergence, this dispensation of rights by the modern nation state is canceled.
446000	451000	Then the other carrying wall is a carrying wall of universal reason.
451000	467000	So that is a single story, single, similar story of progress, development, and human civilization that universalizes itself and that also it raises the possibility of existence of other stories.
467000	477000	So other stories then either backward because this one is the one heading or pushing humanity forward or they have no value.
477000	484000	So a word that has been used to talk about this erasure is epistemicide.
484000	489000	It tries to kill other stories, other epistemes.
489000	499000	And then there is a roof of the house which is then sitting on this two carrying walls and the foundational structure of separability, which changes.
499000	503000	We have had the roof of industrial capitalism.
503000	509000	We have had roofs of socialism depends on where this house has been located.
509000	529000	But currently we have the roof of speculative algorithmic global capitalism, necro capitalism, if you like, where there are differences in structural limitations of this roof,
529000	548000	because the optimization of profit also generates in this roof specifically a form of anonymity that makes it very, very difficult to make people accountable or responsible for what it does to the rest of the house.
548000	557000	So in the book, we talk about the history of the house to the fact that the house was created and is sustained through violence.
557000	576000	So there is one picture in the book where you see overconsumption within the house and overproduction of waste and then two arrows to the planet, one of expropriation of what we call resources into the house and the other one of the waste, like waste disposal into the planet.
576000	582000	And in the planet we see dispossession, distribution, genocides and ecocides.
583000	606000	And then from there we have another picture of the house where you have the penthouse at the top, then we have the middle of the house with the stairs of social mobility in the basement of the house in the sewage of the house going into the planet and some people in the planet trying to fight for something else for another way of existing but being kind of engulfed by the sewage.
606000	622000	And then we talk about the different modes of engagement with the house. So those who want social mobility, those who want just the protection of the house and do not necessarily have either access to social mobility or buy into a different ontology.
623000	642000	And those in the planet, like the Huniqui people in the Amazon, who are fighting against the financialization of the forest, even through carbon trading, they are fighting against carbon trading because it financializes the forest and prevents them from leaving and seeing themselves and existing as part of the forest.
643000	669000	But these other possibilities of existence outside of the house are rendered unintelligible or backward or in some times because of deforestation because of the pollution of the water or about the impact of climate change it becomes impossible for you to stay outside of the house and then you're not on the houses door because you have been dispossessed.
669000	687000	So with all of this, the house is in trouble, the house has lots of cracks, the roof is cracking, there's lots of mold and fractures, and we see ecological, economic, mental health crisis within the house.
687000	696000	And so this image invites us to think about the kinds of questions that happen when we are facing the signs of social and ecological collapse.
697000	714000	And then the next question to be asked is how are we who have been born within the house prepared to approach these questions and or to ask different questions as we see this house crumble.
714000	718000	There's more but I think I'll pause there and see where we go with that.
718000	723000	The carrying walls almost sounded like propaganda.
724000	731000	Like part of the story that we're telling is to keep others from recognizing what you're just describing.
731000	737000	So there's like this erasure of the epistemes that you mentioned.
737000	740000	I hadn't thought about that but it makes sense to me.
741000	742000	It's very interesting.
743000	764000	My work, my research is around education and how education, instead of seeing education as something that addresses ignorance, it's about how we can see education as something that addresses denials or sanctioned socialist ignorance.
764000	784000	So in that sense, I think we have been told stories about progress development and how we're building a civilization in ways that that erase the costs of the story to the planet and to other people's right.
784000	802000	And the difference between seeing education as something that addresses ignorance and seeing education as something that addresses denials is that if in education that addresses ignorance, if you present the information to people and they say, oh, okay, I get it.
802000	805000	Then they go and change something.
805000	814000	But if you're working with denials, we're working with sanctioned ignorances that are rewarded.
814000	824000	So whenever you present this information, there is a response and a reaction to deny this information again and sometimes to even shoot the message.
824000	825000	Right.
825000	837000	So my work has been trying to look at what are the denials, what are the anchoring denials that we have reproduced through education.
837000	851000	So for example, the denial of complicity and violence, the fact that our comforts, securities, enjoyments are all subsidized by expropriation, exploitation, and they happen at the expense of the other people of the land.
852000	857000	So we deny that and we enjoy them thinking that there's no consequence, for example.
857000	870000	The second denial is the denial of unsustainability, the fact that infinite growth or growth based economy cannot be sustained in the long term in a finite planet.
871000	880000	Then there is the denial of entanglement, the fact that we are part of the metabolism of the planet, rather than separate entities.
880000	894000	In that the planet itself and its metabolism has wisdom, has bio-wisdom that can come through our own bodies because our bodies are also land.
894000	897000	So we're talking about the land, we're talking about our bodies as land.
897000	905000	We don't see that and education doesn't really encourage or promote that idea.
905000	922000	And the last denial that we have anchored with my research collective, we have anchored our analysis on, is the denial of the depth and magnitude of the challenges we are facing right now.
922000	938000	And with that, the conditioned desire to look for simplistic solutions that make us feel and look good, but they do not address the root causes of our predicament.
938000	946000	So in that sense, we are kind of unprepared to face the magnitude, the depth and the scale of the problem.
946000	951000	And that takes us back to education, what education can do.
951000	962000	So if education has been part of the problem, how can and what kind of education could help us through a different form of coexistence?
962000	974000	You've used a lot of different words and lenses than I've used, but at the core of your story is the superorganism is out competing all the other cultures.
974000	984000	It's blind, it's hungry for energy and resources and the individual components of it, us, you mentioned worthy of being alive.
984000	989000	They're only worth something to the superorganism if they contribute value.
989000	995000	So our stories rhyme quite a bit so far and what you're saying.
995000	1001000	So you describe the house and your book is called Hospicing Modernity.
1001000	1003000	So the house needs hospicing.
1003000	1005000	What does that mean?
1005000	1008000	Why do we need to hospice modernity?
1008000	1016000	If it's destructive and dying, shouldn't we focus on the birth of something new or how can you unpack this?
1016000	1020000	That's a very interesting question that comes up very often too.
1020000	1033000	So where the analysis is coming from and it's coming from collaboration with indigenous communities that talk about the house and colonialism basically as a disease.
1033000	1043000	And if you try to fight colonialism as a machine, you need to stop it and it manifests as a machine too.
1043000	1050000	We have to have that strategy there, but if you fight it as a disease, it's a different approach.
1050000	1071000	If it is a disease in a superorganism, what we're talking about is that if the moment that we try to construct another house or to fight it directly, we have to use its tools and its modes of existence so that it even becomes intelligible for that.
1071000	1089000	What I'm saying here is that, and maybe I'm using this other metaphor in an artistic project with Azul, who's one of the art, a Colombian artist who works with us, and it's like there is a sick dragon, right?
1089000	1098000	You're playing fireflame and burning everything, but the moment you try to fight the dragon, you become a dragon yourself.
1098000	1105000	Or the moment you kill the dragon, you also have many other dragons being born out of that killing.
1105000	1120000	And if the dragon is sick and you don't want to kill the dragon, you want the dragon to be healthy and to be integrated in the ecology of things, then the work that you need to do is very different.
1120000	1142000	It's the same with the House of Modernity, so if something is dying and carrying a lot of undigested teachings and lessons, if we try to imagine the new from that indigestion or that constipation, we will only be able to imagine the same, but in different clothes with a little bit of change.
1142000	1153000	Unless we process these teachings of the House as it is dying, we cannot imagine something that is very different, that is not going to reproduce the same mistakes.
1153000	1168000	So offering palliative care to the House dying, offering a death with dignity, or figuring out how to find what can heal the dragon, right?
1168000	1176000	It's work that is very different from trying to build something from the undigested lessons of the old.
1176000	1190000	So we talk about hospicing as disinvestment in the futurity of something while you have the patience to compost the shit that has been accumulated.
1190000	1210000	At the same time that you are offering prenatal care to what is being born, not actually being born, what's gestating, but without suffocating what is going to be born with your projections and idealizations coming from the unprocessed lessons of the old,
1210000	1213000	because we haven't processed that collectively yet.
1213000	1234000	And then this new thing, also having a healthy skeptical pragmatism in relationship to that, saying what is being born is hopefully or potentially wiser and that wisdom will depend on how much we've learned or we've been taught from the old.
1234000	1243000	So it's potentially wiser, but not necessarily, right? It can actually go in a worse direction that the other one is coming.
1243000	1264000	So this narrative of progress, dialectical narrative of progress of a thesis and synthesis that require a progression to something that is better is part of the house of modernity and needs to be interrupted if we are to do this difference, basically.
1264000	1285000	So the word hospice is correlated with having cancer and or end of life things. Is it presumed in your book and in your work that modernity is in its demise that it's fatal and something else will come after? Is that a given?
1286000	1299000	I think the assumption is that it's terminal, right? So basically the idea that growth based economies in the finite planet, it's just impossible.
1299000	1317000	And that goes back to what Daniel Schmattenberger has been saying about the narrow boundary intelligence being terminal as well. So the optimization of profit in this context is not going to lead us to, we don't have another planet.
1317000	1329000	We can't expand the boundaries of the planet. So in that sense, modernity is dying. But I also hear that the superorganism is extremely resilient, right?
1329000	1358000	And figuring out how to, back to the dragon, figuring out how to get to the point where we can experiment with what could interrupt this libidinal attachments, because we're not only talking here about ways of thinking, it's ways of desiring, it's ways of hoping, it's ways of relating, it's ways of imagining.
1359000	1375000	Even that have been contaminated by this, these ease and how difficult and challenging it is to intentionally not reproduce that when a lot of it is also unconscious.
1376000	1391000	How difficult it is to not reproduce that is your hope that 1%, 5%, 10% of humans kind of wake up and see the story that you're presenting.
1391000	1405000	But in doing so, they don't turn into the dragons themselves or kill the dragon because that perpetuates the dynamic that led us to this. But what would be the...
1405000	1407000	What's the theory of change?
1407000	1410000	Yes, okay, thank you.
1410000	1420000	It is an interesting thing too, and so back again to theories of change that originate in context of high intensity struggle, right?
1420000	1441000	So we've been working, guided with the guidance of indigenous communities in the global south, that the first thing that they did with my team, my research team going there was to draw attention to the arrogance we have around our own theories of change,
1441000	1461000	the theories of change that are intelligible in the global north. So their understanding, one of the things we were taught, for example, is that if we are a collective organism, whatever it is that we do in the direction of healing of this dragon,
1461000	1473000	if we use that metaphor, is it resonates within the whole organism but not in ways that we can predict or control, right?
1473000	1483000	So there is that aspect of thinking about it metabolically but not in a causal mechanistic reductionist way.
1483000	1488000	So we were challenged with that too because we wanted to know, okay, if we do this, what's the result?
1488000	1498000	If we try that and give me the outcome before I even start doing that because my motivation is related to that teleology, right?
1498000	1509000	And what we were told is that you need to trust the invisible to make the impossible possible if you're working in an entangled way.
1509000	1521000	And for us, that was also very challenging because one of the things we didn't want to reproduce in this collaboration was spiritual bypassing of things.
1521000	1527000	Okay, let's just trust the universe that it's going to create the conditions.
1527000	1538000	And that is training, I think, that we have to understand we don't have in Western societies about working intuitively from the gut with us.
1538000	1550000	So what we were told was that any experiment in the direction of healing that is fully politicized can create ripple effects that are not in our control.
1550000	1567000	And that there will be a time where it's going to be, maybe if the storm is going to be upon us, the storm is already upon many like social collapse happens all the time so that we can be here, right?
1567000	1571000	Our privilege is predicated upon collapse somewhere else.
1571000	1581000	So when our bubble of protection is breached and we are faced with the collapse ourselves, that collapses a teacher.
1581000	1595000	And at that point, there will be an opening where a lot that has been waiting to come as a teaching will be able to land basically.
1595000	1605000	But like the only way I can explain, the best way to explain it is through a slow, what is it called?
1605000	1619000	It's a saying that we have in Brazil, which is that in a situation of a flood, you can only really swim when the water reaches your bum.
1619000	1622000	Before that, you can only walk or wade.
1622000	1636000	So basically this hospicing process, although we started without the protection bubble being breached, you can't think your way out of this basically.
1636000	1648000	You have to encounter the flood in ways that are already really high for you and you need to remember that your body is water.
1648000	1652000	In that you can swim, other people have swam before you.
1652000	1656000	And that's the role I think of Indigenous knowledge is in this.
1656000	1665000	I don't believe Indigenous knowledge can give us the instructions of how to swim in our particular flood that we're going to have to face.
1665000	1671000	But they can remind us that it's possible to swim because these people have survived.
1672000	1688000	And that in itself creates the possibility that our current, that gives us the idea that our current neurophysiology and the limitations that have been imposed upon it are one configuration.
1688000	1700000	There are other configurations of existence and of being that are possible and that could survive even when the waters are very high.
1700000	1712000	So whatever we are doing in the hospicing is preparing for the collapse of the house or the storms that are coming so that we can approach it in a very different way.
1712000	1725000	But in order to do that, we have to recognize that the ways of approaching problems that came from the house itself are not going to be sufficient in helping us when the house comes down.
1725000	1736000	But we could maybe buy some swim trunks and some flippers and think about the need to swim when the water reaches our bum.
1736000	1739000	How do you say that phrase in Portuguese, by the way?
1739000	1744000	Well, it's not the most sophisticated.
1744000	1750000	It's just that you can swim when the water hits your bum.
1750000	1752000	Okay, awesome.
1752000	1758000	Which is not what I would say in the podcast, but there you go.
1759000	1769000	So is there any way that the dragon metaphorically could somehow morph into an orangutan or a deer?
1769000	1781000	Because if the orangutan, I mean, if the dragon dies, then lots of people and infrastructure, there's a collapse risk.
1781000	1787000	So the hospicing isn't a perfect analogy, but what are your thoughts on that?
1788000	1805000	So with Azul, who is the artist that came up with this dragon metaphor, we were talking about the need for people who can work with the fire flame and do the damage control of the fire, and that's extremely important.
1806000	1827000	But we also need, according to Azul, the artists, the alchemists, the clowns to distract the dragon so that other things are experimented with within that diseased body that can immunize the dragon to the disease.
1827000	1834000	So the heat of the dragon, the warmth of the dragon, with the dragon's consent could be put to good use.
1834000	1836000	The dragon is part of the ecology.
1836000	1842000	It is the disease that is the problem, not necessarily the dragon.
1843000	1857000	And the dragon, as you said, can shape shift and can be scaled to become enormous or maybe the medicine to the dragon is one of shrinking the dragon.
1857000	1862000	It allows this flexibility.
1862000	1882000	I think what metaphors do in this case house dragons and there's always the risk of overdoing the metaphors, but they invite relationally the part of the brain that or our neuro physiological system that has been starved for, for relationality to come to the
1882000	1889000	for and to see the movement of things rather than the focus and fixate on the form of things.
1889000	1891000	I totally agree with that.
1891000	1909000	And I totally believe that we do need artists and storytellers and theatrical and musicians to open a window between our neocortex and our limbic system in a way that lets us think outside of the box, as it were.
1909000	1918000	So, Vanessa, you write a lot about difficult emotions or what you call affective responses.
1918000	1926000	I think it would be helpful for our listeners if you dove into this, but let me preface that by a question.
1926000	1931000	I've heard you pretty actively discourage people from reading your own book.
1931000	1935000	What's up with that?
1936000	1938000	The hostessing process, right?
1938000	1946000	So the hostessing process requires an internal intuition that something is actually dying.
1946000	1956000	And in Western culture, talking about death in a culture that is trying to avoid it is actually kind of announcing it.
1956000	1969000	And it often, it often prompt aggressive responses back and super, super emotionally charged responses back.
1969000	1981000	So the kind of education that I'm talking about, which I'm calling probiotic education, which is the hard level to deal with that undigested constipation, right?
1981000	1993000	That we have, it requires people to be ready to do it, because maybe the metaphor in there is that that kind of education creates some diarrhea, controlled diarrhea.
1993000	1996000	And it is about composting and digesting stuff.
1996000	2008000	So if people come to this wanting something else, wanting mastery, wanting certainty, wanting control, and they kind of get caught into the deep side of the pool,
2008000	2012000	without anybody there to support, right?
2012000	2014000	It can be actually harmful.
2014000	2029000	So a third of the book, I think, is about saying, like, look, if mastery, certainty, control, predictability, simple solutions is what you're looking for.
2029000	2036000	Please don't read this book, because if you go to the deep end and then you find yourself drowning there,
2036000	2040000	there's nothing I can do to support you, right?
2040000	2044000	I should probably have the same disclaimer on this podcast, generally.
2044000	2045000	I think so.
2045000	2046000	But you're right.
2046000	2047000	You're right.
2047000	2049000	Which is why I don't advertise it per se.
2049000	2054000	It's just word of mouth and the people that show up and want to hear conversations like this.
2054000	2060000	So go on about affective responses and difficult emotions.
2060000	2063000	What's an affective response?
2063000	2072000	So generally, when we're thinking about emotions, we make a distinction between emotion and cognition and reason, right?
2072000	2080000	In order to move away from that distinction, because emotions are physiological responses, and so is reason, right?
2080000	2083000	Everything is a physiological response.
2083000	2085000	Then there is affect theory.
2085000	2090000	So that's coming from both psychology and psychoanalysis.
2090000	2101000	This idea that if we need to be thinking about our bodies, rather than just our brains, as the neurocircuit that experiences the world,
2101000	2107000	and affective responses are these physiological discharges that we have that can be pleasant or unpleasant,
2107000	2112000	that can be of arousal, that can be of numbness, too.
2112000	2114000	So there's a spectrum there.
2114000	2127000	And so the work around the house is to check the design, the architecture of these responses that is conditioned by the house, right?
2127000	2134000	So we are rewarded and encouraged to respond in certain, we learn to respond in certain ways.
2134000	2141000	And within the house, the way that we learn to respond to complexity, for example,
2141000	2148000	is to see the layers of complexity that we have, the stacked ones, and then we collapse them into one.
2148000	2155000	And in this collapsed layer, we impose a narrative of coherence that becomes our certainties.
2155000	2161000	We then edit out what doesn't fit this narrative of coherence, and we police the borders, right?
2161000	2170000	And the energy that is necessary to defend and protect that narrative of coherence is enormous that we have to put in that.
2170000	2181000	So it becomes, in times like now where complexity is exponential, it becomes kind of a pressure cooker, right?
2181000	2193000	That you have to invest so much in keeping the lid on that it takes all your energy, it takes all your head and heart space.
2193000	2208000	And that's the time where if you believe the promises of the house are broken and that there is somebody who can restore the possibility that the house can stand and exist in a finite planet the way it is,
2208000	2213000	you are going to vote for those who make that promise, right?
2213000	2225000	So if we're thinking about this scenario with the lid of the pressure cooker, what we need to do in terms of dealing with the difficult emotions that come...
2225000	2235000	It is related to opening that lid, opening that lid as we expand our capacity to see the different moving layers of complexity,
2235000	2252000	to let go of the attachment to certainty control coherence and consumption of things, to be able to sit with difficult, painful and complex things without feeling overwhelmed or immobilized.
2252000	2264000	So if we don't get there, if we don't get to this stage of being able to face complexity or let's say, vulca, which is volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity,
2264000	2272000	we will go back to the narrow boundary relationships and intelligence and understandings.
2272000	2286000	So for me, this taking the lid off and being able to not only cognitively face complexity but also effectively to be able to have the neurophysiological setup,
2286000	2315000	to not have to have all the answers to approach things with curiosity, to not be invested in that either or dogma is part of what education needs to do so that we can get to the wide boundary intelligence that Daniel also talks about.
2315000	2324000	But that's different from wisdom, that's still different from wisdom, I think, and figuring out...
2324000	2335000	We talk about four, a compass that gestures towards wisdom of four different dimensions. One is emotional sobriety.
2335000	2347000	So emotional sobriety or emotional stability is where you are able to interrupt the compulsions that have been conditioned by modernity.
2347000	2358000	And here we're talking about, we're conditioned to uncertainty and control. We are conditioned to consume everything, not just stuff but also experiences, relationships.
2358000	2370000	We are conditioned to consume critique and outrage. So figuring out a rehab process for that emotional instabilities one piece.
2371000	2391000	The next piece is relational maturity. So realizing that Western society or modernity or the superorganism, it's a teenage, they're in a teenage state and that process of growing up cannot be done for others.
2391000	2399000	So going into indigenous communities and saying, okay, teach us how to grow up is not an option, really.
2399000	2416000	We can look at other cultures that produce grown-ups as uncles and aunties who can redirect, but we can't appropriate that knowledge for our own maturity.
2416000	2433000	So when we talk about relational maturity is the realization of how embedded we are in the metabolism of the planet and how the responsibility that we have towards everything needs to be visceral, not something that is just an intellectual choice.
2433000	2448000	Then we have the third one is intellectual discernment, which relates directly about how we can move from narrow boundary to wide boundary and learn to diffract ourselves.
2448000	2464000	Diffraction is a word that is used as opposed to reductionism. So reductionism tries to reduce things. Diffraction tries to expand and see the multiple layers and that needs to be done with our own identities.
2464000	2485000	So we have this, it's another metaphor and a methodology we use called the bus within us. We invite people to see themselves as a bus of creatures with a driver and then there are people at or passengers at the front who you know very well,
2485000	2500000	passengers in the middle who you only hear from time to time and passengers at the back of your being who you don't know. And we invite people to observe that dynamic conversation and to learn from the dynamic, to learn to learn from the dynamic.
2500000	2512000	And this is because if we can't hold space for the complexity of our own responses to things, we have no chance of holding space for the complexity around us.
2512000	2533000	So here we talk about and back to your question about difficult emotions. Here we talk about developing the stomach to face the amount of shit that we need to compost without throwing up without throwing a tantrum and without throwing in the towel.
2534000	2549000	And the last thing in the compass towards wisdom is intergenerational responsibility but here again, we're not talking about just human responsibility but to the human and on human family.
2549000	2574000	We're talking about the ability to say the buck stops here in my generation, right? We've inherited the super organism, the house, the sick dragon, but I need to do something because this is placing the future, the children on the path or humanity on the path of premature extinction or extinction,
2574000	2601000	mass extinction in slow motion, as Nino Ahoniqui talks about. So the intergenerational responsibility, again, is not an intellectual choice. It is something visceral, something that comes from the gut in that when in a crisis, we'll move you to do what's needed rather than what best fits your self-interest.
2601000	2624000	Wow. There's so much that resonates there. Again, you're using different words to describe some of my own core beliefs on this stuff. When you say the buck stops here, presumably you meant the financialization of the human experience, not the actual buck and doe and fawn stopping here because that also is possible.
2625000	2652000	So emotional sobriety, relational maturity, intellectual discernment, and intergenerational response. I just got back from India and I had a break and one of my biggest ahas was that to merely explain the facts of our situation, the ecological breakdown, the impact on the oceans,
2652000	2676000	our unsustainable spending, debt, energy depletion, social fracturing. If you just give people those facts, it's really not going to lead to anything. And part of the reason is that we have trauma. We are not behaviorally healthy stacked humans for the most part.
2677000	2703000	And I think we need to have healthy people in community nourished with exercise and good food and oxytocin and friends and music and in an emotionally and reptilian fight-or-flight stability of that system before we get to intergenerational response.
2703000	2725000	Because if you don't have those sorts of humans, they're in a constant observing the walls of the house that you described earlier and it's not a productive place to be in. So how important is it in your work that we get humans to that starting point?
2726000	2739000	You know, a friend of mine, James, says we need libraries of healing around the country, around the world. Can we get there? What do you think about that and are you working in that direction?
2740000	2756000	So this is also a super interesting question that has come up for my collective a lot of times. And this is because we work at the interface of questions related to social and ecological violence.
2756000	2775000	And sometimes there's two things. There's conflict in that interface. So we have groups that go more in the direction you're talking about, especially oxytocin is problematic, though, because oxytocin is both the codon hormone, but also a hormone of mothers and babies.
2776000	2783000	And if that hormone is not transcended in the relationship between the mother and the baby, you have a problem.
2783000	2788000	Well, oxytocin is also a huge tribal in-group out-group.
2788000	2801000	Yeah, exactly. So we have a problem there. Maybe serotonin and acetylcholine might be a better metaphor for the neurochemical direction you want this to go.
2801000	2803000	What does acetycholine do?
2804000	2817000	It does. It is associated with epiphanies in laughter. So engaging with curiosity and something not predetermine what you want from that relationship.
2817000	2832000	Because oxytocin in a society where relationships are transactional can become both leading to mutual codelish and self-infantalization.
2833000	2846000	I can tell you more of that, where we got this from, but I think I'm going to go back to the idea of, so there are groups that want to go along and get along and they feel that that is the most important thing that they need to do.
2846000	2864000	And what happens there is that generally critical questions, it becomes difficult to keep the level of discomfort and dissonance that you also need for the neuroplasticity to happen and for you to become, like, to enact responsible reasoning.
2865000	2877000	So the reasoning then is in service of this projective relationships where you have to belong and be accepted and have your identity validated.
2878000	2883000	So it can go in that direction and it's much more complex than that. I'm simplifying here.
2883000	2894000	On the other hand, you have all these other communities of critical questions, right, where becoming critical is one of the in-group, out-group things too.
2895000	2901000	You are then competing with each other to see who's the most critical or the highest moral high ground.
2902000	2913000	And then it can become also a competition for who's the most oppressed and who is going to be most deserving of having the platform or the microphone, right?
2914000	2918000	So we've been working at the interface of these two things and saying we need something else.
2919000	2925000	We can't have only a therapeutic space because we can't hug ourselves out of this.
2926000	2936000	And on this side, we can't have just a critical competition space because we can't think ourselves out of this either, right?
2937000	2944000	So figuring out, and it might not be a combination of the two. It might be something else altogether.
2945000	2959000	You see what I mean? Like the neurochemistry of both. So one, the critical one is based on its dopamine for sure, but also the transgressive bit about it, right?
2960000	2970000	I want to be transgressive. The other one is I want to be accepting and accepted, which goes into a very specific form of relationship.
2970000	2979000	Where we would need to go is a place where we do not have to make any effort to feel accountable.
2980000	2985000	It's not coming from the external, right? It's coming internally. We are accountable.
2985000	3001000	And where we are okay in walking or moving together in a foggy road and learning and learning together and making mistakes together, but being accountable for those affected by our mistakes.
3002000	3005000	So it's a very different neurochemistry.
3005000	3018000	Serotonin, metaphorically, and again, I'm not a neuroscientist. I don't want to be a neuroscientist, but serotonin could be a metaphor for the sense of entanglement and relationship with everything.
3018000	3032000	However, without the teachings that go with that relationship, it can become this, and this is what is reinforced in Western society, this idea that the elation part of it, I feel connected.
3033000	3038000	But when I feel, I want to feel connected, I want to feel connected with everything that's beautiful.
3039000	3043000	But I forget that I'm also connected with everything that is destroying that beauty.
3044000	3059000	So figuring out how to have a serotonin process that allows us to compost the shit without drowning in the sadness of it, because it's super sad.
3060000	3084000	So maybe a shit composting party would be the closest that we have where we see ourselves as both insufficient and indispensable so that that foundational regard, unconditional regard is the removal of the foundation of separability of the house and the restoring of the intrinsic value of your life.
3085000	3088000	You do not have to prove why you're here, right?
3089000	3093000	The Huniqui and the Amazon talk about this in a useful way here.
3094000	3103000	They talk about identity and belonging within the house, being grounded on human constructs of group affinity and affiliation.
3104000	3113000	So your identity would be about where you come from, citizenship, racial affiliation, ethnic affiliation, whatever.
3114000	3122000	And then they say, although you cannot bypass that, that is important because it's also related to the conflicts and the shit that we have inherited.
3123000	3134000	There is also another thing that defines your identity that we have forgotten within the house, which is a umbilical cord that we have with the center of the metabolism of the earth.
3135000	3143000	And that umbilical cord is in the gut, and that's why it serves as an antenna for the information you receive from the earth about what to do next.
3144000	3158000	However, if you're not paying attention to that, or you don't have the discipline and the practice of relying on that umbilical cord for identity and belonging, which is not identity and belonging defined by human parameters, right?
3159000	3160000	It is beyond understanding.
3160000	3175000	It's a direct experience of being alive in a metabolic system that is the planet, that is conscious and intelligent, too.
3176000	3186000	And if you look at the ceremonies and the educational practices of these communities, you will see that a number of different things.
3187000	3196000	Number one is that the relationship with pain is very different and from the beginning, like you look at the kid and you already imagine this kid as an elder, right?
3196000	3204000	And the role of the community is to support this person into becoming a good elder and good ancestor for all relationships.
3205000	3209000	The other thing, so it's a different relationship with pain.
3210000	3211000	It's a different relationship with death.
3212000	3223000	It's a different relationship with responsibility, but it is also in different neurochemistry because through the engagement with different plants, and here I'm not just talking about ayahuasca.
3223000	3244000	There's a thousand plants in the Amazon, for example, that you encounter and that they become your teachers and they show you that there is a conscience beyond human conscience and that the human conscience is very limited in what you can imagine.
3244000	3257000	So you learn to relate to the mystery of existence, the motion of the metabolism and both the visible and invisible matter of reality.
3258000	3273000	And I think that for me, like when I heard Daniel talk about and you talk about wisdom, that is the place, I think, where it is about the whole, but it's about the matter, both visible and invisible.
3274000	3281000	The matter, the motion and the mystery of living in something that is much bigger than ourselves.
3282000	3301000	So Daniel and I talked about wide boundary intelligence and also he has an upcoming paper that we're going to do a podcast on called the naive progress, which is that we measure something as progress, but we ignore all the other negative things that happened along with it.
3301000	3304000	And we just maybe are in denial about those things.
3305000	3317000	But is this narrow boundary intelligence, do we also have a narrow boundary perception of self and how we're related to everything else?
3318000	3332000	Like I mentioned, I just got back from India and my coach was one of the disciples of Krishna Murthy who famously said, without relationship, you are not for to be is to be related.
3333000	3336000	You exist only in relationship, otherwise you don't exist.
3336000	3341000	So I think in your book, you write about relational intelligence.
3342000	3344000	Is this a similar sentiment to that?
3345000	3353000	And how do we potentially expand our definition of self from the really narrow boundary that our culture currently has?
3355000	3356000	Yeah, definitely.
3356000	3375000	So if we're thinking about narrow boundary, the way that we have encountered the work, the conversation between you and Daniel and took it to the Amazon, to Chief Nino Ahunikui, where as we were developing this project called the University of the Forest.
3376000	3380000	And it was such a useful thing, heuristic.
3381000	3399000	I have to thank both of you for the gift that it was exactly what we needed at the time because we were talking about colonialism as a disease and the narrow boundary framing helped us think about cognitively what what does this narrow boundary do?
3400000	3411000	Effectively, what does it do? And relationally, we looked at five ACEs in terms of narrow boundary, effective conditionings.
3412000	3421000	So within the House of Modernity, we will be looking for the first aid is moral, epistemic and political authority.
3422000	3430000	Then the next aid is arbitration of justice, lawfulness and common sense.
3431000	3438000	Then we have the aid of unrestricted and unaccountable autonomy.
3439000	3447000	Then we have the aid of affirmation of our virtue and our innocence and purity.
3447000	3457000	And the last aid, which is related to the other four, is the accumulation of capital and appropriation of capital.
3458000	3472000	So figuring out how these investments that we have, which are effective, we are not calculating it nor necessarily consciously, it's what's rewarded.
3472000	3477000	It is what is expected of you in this kind of society.
3478000	3500000	So in order to open up the relationality, which is the gut part of it that we have to get to, we need to process these things that are restricting the ways we define our being and our beingness within other beings.
3501000	3512000	So you talk about the umbilical cord to the earth and that comes through our guts, but isn't like the majority of serotonin not produced in the brain but in our guts?
3513000	3528000	And so doesn't our food supply, which has lots of problems with processed food and pesticides and endocrine disruptors and all that, doesn't that kind of already sicken the umbilical cord connection to the earth?
3530000	3531000	For sure.
3532000	3548000	Yeah, the problem that the D's, E's of the umbilical cord has many different metabolic, both material and invisible components to it, but the food for sure.
3549000	3550000	We're being poisoned.
3551000	3560000	So you've used the word metabolic often on this podcast and I think in your book you talk about metabolic literacy.
3561000	3568000	I talk about metabolic literacy too with the superorganism and the biological scaling of organisms and ecosystems.
3569000	3579000	How do you see what you term metabolic literacy relating to my phraseology of the economic superorganism?
3580000	3583000	Or can you explain what you mean by metabolic literacy?
3584000	3585000	This looks like a test.
3586000	3587000	No, not a test.
3588000	3592000	It's just that we're, I'm, I'm, I know a little of your work.
3593000	3594000	We have many common friends.
3595000	3601000	We have lots of people that are like, you've got to get Vanessa on the podcast, but in hearing you, I just see so many parallels.
3602000	3607000	It's like we're telling the same story with a different, a different tone and a different vocabulary.
3608000	3609000	I agree.
3610000	3616000	And there's so many resonances and I'm so happy that I encountered your work and the podcast as well.
3617000	3623000	And as I said, like I have to say a huge thank you for, for the latest heuristic.
3624000	3631000	It really opened up a completely different way of going about the other project, the University of the Forest Project.
3632000	3633000	And we were also happy about it.
3634000	3635000	So thank you again.
3636000	3637000	But back to the exam question.
3638000	3643000	I think that in the book, let me go back to that, to that, to what's in the book.
3643000	3656000	I mentioned that I had heard in an Indigenous gathering a discussion about individualism versus collectivism versus metabolism.
3657000	3658000	And I was like, what?
3659000	3668000	I had never heard it to describe a way of, a way of, of perceiving interaction, political interactions, right?
3668000	3675000	So generally we, we tend to think about it's in either individualism or collectivism, but both are super anthropocentric.
3676000	3679000	When I asked, when I probe to like, what is this about?
3680000	3687000	And this is about not seeing yourself as a separate entity.
3688000	3692000	So everything about our lives is about interaction.
3692000	3699000	So the, the, the, the air we breathe is what the trees exhale, right?
3700000	3715000	Whatever comes into the mouth is already dead and or dying or will be digested or become part of the, the, the communities that digest whatever comes next.
3715000	3723000	And what we leave back to the earth is also going to become food for something else.
3724000	3742000	That basic, like super basic understanding of being part of something of this movement and, and, and catalysis of things is already missing in, in the, whatever education we have within the house, right?
3742000	3751000	And it's not just the food or the air, but also all the chemical processes in the body, the chemistries, right?
3752000	3754000	That they are also contagious.
3755000	3762000	So if we're thinking of, for example, about education, the current education system is very dopamine focused.
3763000	3767000	It's about mastery. It's about achievement. It's about individual competition, right?
3767000	3776000	And we are training this metabolism to look for that and to feel good when you get that high, when you hit that high.
3777000	3783000	And that high is very ephemeral in a way, right?
3784000	3786000	So it's not a high that lasts very long.
3787000	3792000	If you, if you hit the high of dopamine in five minutes, you will find another one.
3792000	3801000	So if we look at education in other communities, in other cultures, you'll see that it's not necessarily going the same direction.
3802000	3812000	And Krishna Murti actually shows a very different neurochemical setup for education that could be, that could be used in this case as a comparison.
3813000	3816000	It's not the only one. There are many, there are many others.
3817000	3827000	Yeah, I think I don't, I don't, I'm remembering the exam question, which was to associate it with the superorganism.
3828000	3832000	The superorganism is giving it a past.
3833000	3834000	Okay, thank you.
3834000	3847000	So the superorganism sells us a very, very limited configuration of well-being, right?
3848000	3850000	And that is no longer working.
3852000	3863000	And as an educator, where, so back to the discussion about social and ecological collapse, when we talk about social and ecological collapse,
3863000	3876000	people generally imagine it's going to be a collapse of access to something, to water, to food, or a big wildfire, access to housing, access to,
3877000	3886000	and with the work with the communities in Brazil, they were worried about something else that now I'm seeing here in the Global North.
3887000	3892000	They were saying that it's our internal infrastructure that is going to collapse.
3893000	3900000	They're saying that modernity is selling about well-being is no longer, is not going to be sufficient.
3901000	3906000	Well, and it's going to be worse for the Global North because of what you just said, is because we've been educated.
3907000	3912000	Our education system is about cranking out newer hits of dopamine.
3912000	3922000	So our individual neurochemistry is one-legged stool and ignores serotonin and acetylcholine and the other things.
3923000	3932000	Whereas indigenous cultures don't have quite that same hyper-focus on dopamine, so, right?
3933000	3935000	Dependency, right, on that.
3936000	3941000	So the well-being in these communities has a different neurochemical cocktail.
3942000	3951000	And it may be a more lasting one than the dopamine one that requires constant fixes.
3952000	3963000	But I think what I was remembering that I needed to say was that the way that I'm seeing this in the Global North as an educator is to look at the schools today.
3963000	3976000	And I am following a little bit of the work of Zach Stein who works with Daniel around this who talks about screen time as low-grade child abuse, right?
3977000	3987000	Because it is algorithmically occupying that infrastructure and exploiting it and extracting value from it.
3987000	3995000	So if we look at schools today, the education sector across the board globally is in trouble.
3996000	4002000	What's happening, I believe, is that the children are the cannery in the mind, right?
4003000	4009000	The level of emotional dysregulation that we see in schools is enormous.
4009000	4013000	Teachers are not prepared to address that.
4014000	4021000	What we see in the kids reflects the meta-crisis, the polycrisis, or the permacrisis in society.
4022000	4034000	And Gen A who's coming, I think, beyond Gen Zs and millennials who have already had most of their conditioning of relationality being done through the screen,
4034000	4043000	they come also with a different kind of anger, and they can feel the sadness in a very different way.
4044000	4052000	So I want to remember to get back to the super-organism question because I have one more, but you brought up Zach Stein.
4053000	4063000	He was on my podcast three days ago, the recording, and he basically says that the root of the meta-crisis problem can be found in education.
4064000	4073000	That our education system is totally contributing to what's happening, and he echoes a lot of the things that you just said.
4074000	4082000	So in looking at work, you are also proposing a new model of education, which you call depth education.
4083000	4089000	Can you explain the core philosophy behind that, and are you hopeful for that to scale?
4089000	4096000	The quickest way to explain mastery education is again through metaphor, basically, and to contrast it with mastery education.
4097000	4107000	So mastery education, the dopamine-based thing that we were talking about, is about putting tea in the cup and then measuring the cup and seeing how much content you've been able to assimilate.
4108000	4117000	Or to think about conquering of a peak, all the skills and competencies, and I'm using conquering with a very colonial connotation.
4117000	4118000	You conquered the mountain.
4119000	4139000	Now, depth education, in contrast, would be more about expanding both our frames of reference and preparing our effective and relational landscapes to face the good, the bad, the ugly, the broken, and the messed up of humanity within us and around us.
4140000	4160000	And figuring out from this teaching what to do next, and being ready to experiment with different things together in a way that is not grounded on those five As that I talked about, or the search for certainty control, coherence, predictability.
4161000	4166000	And that moves us from the narrow boundary to wide boundary to wisdom.
4166000	4176000	So I know you are a professor, and I think you're the head of a department at UBC, Victoria, and elsewhere.
4177000	4185000	But do you actually teach now still students, and how are these concepts resonating with young humans in your classes?
4186000	4189000	So I'm the dean of the Faculty of Education.
4190000	4191000	Yeah.
4192000	4193000	It's a different level.
4194000	4202000	Do I teach very, more rarely now, because I mean, in leadership work are different things that we have to do.
4203000	4216000	There is a course that is a community, it's open to the community that has been created at UVic called Facing Human Rounds, Climate Complexity and Relational Accountability.
4216000	4226000	And there's so much to be said about this course in terms of what we've learned from trying to make this an offering that people can access.
4227000	4230000	But one thing that we had to do was to create a questionnaire.
4231000	4239000	Just like in the book, we have half of the, like not half, but a third of the book, trying to convince people not to do, not to read the book.
4240000	4253000	There's also a questionnaire that's trying to convince people not to take the course in order to be responsible, right, in order not to promise, because people are used to the promises of mastery.
4254000	4259000	And if they come with the same expectations, it can go in a very, it could be even harmful.
4260000	4270000	So people need to understand what they're getting into and they need to be ready to the ask of the course, which is an ask that says, you're not going to be told what you think or what to do.
4271000	4278000	You are not going to be told, you're going to be offered unconditional regard.
4279000	4291000	However, you need to suspend for six weeks, which is because the course is an intensive asynchronous course with tutorials, but for six weeks, you need to suspend your desire for simple solutions.
4292000	4296000	You need to suspend your desire for hope in the future, because hope needs to be in the present.
4297000	4304000	You need to suspend your desire for community, for human community for six weeks, it's temporarily, temporary suspension.
4304000	4319000	And this is because what we found in piloting and testing the course that people use human conversation as the way to deflect from actually going deeper into what they need to go deeper in, right?
4320000	4325000	So if for six weeks you can't do that, don't take the course.
4326000	4330000	If you need to be talking to people all the time, maybe this course is not for you right now.
4330000	4352000	You are just echoing so many things in my recent life, because I just did a six week journey in India and my coach noticed that in the 30 people I kept when we got to an uncomfortable area, I would do some joke or some social thing and he would yell at me and say,
4352000	4353000	Nate, stop doing that.
4354000	4356000	You have to look inward and be quiet.
4357000	4358000	And that's what you just said.
4358000	4359000	And it also is six weeks.
4360000	4365000	Yeah, that's a synchrony, serendipity.
4366000	4376000	And so we've tried to map these traps, right, where people get caught, like they get stuck, basically, and invite people to look at that.
4377000	4380000	And we're not the ones saying, judging, basically.
4380000	4388000	We're just saying that this is what we've mapped and it's up to you to take to embrace the responsibility for your learning and then learning.
4389000	4408000	So that's that part about people going through this course and us helping supporting other faculty members, not only at UVic, but across the board to design based on principles of regenerative inquiry, which is what depth education is about.
4408000	4419000	So we're trying to develop not it's not the scholarship so much, but the practice of designing in a specific way, designing learning experiences in a specific way.
4420000	4424000	And then at the same time that I'm trying to apply the same thing in leadership.
4425000	4430000	So universities are going through a lot right now.
4430000	4433000	There are many different layers of the challenges of universities.
4434000	4448000	And they're they're very much in the VUCA context like volatility uncertainty complexity ambiguity in certain contexts, you can talk about the matter crisis and the poly crisis in the permit crisis, but in certain contexts you still can't.
4448000	4467000	Right, so being a leader in an institution or in a sector in a higher education sector that is going through this is also extremely rich in terms of practicing and testing and experimenting with tools of inquiry.
4468000	4477000	Right, that we need to be able to try to figure out how to support the dragon in healing itself.
4478000	4502000	So it seems to me Vanessa that at the core of everything that you're describing is an invitation to humanity to grow up and become more accountable and responsible for the obvious if you're paying attention but culturally hidden patterns of destruction that modernity rests on.
4503000	4506000	So this is a big, big calling.
4507000	4514000	And I know because I've been, you know, working, swimming the same river because in my life it is up to my bum.
4515000	4518000	But on a personal personal level, how do you do this?
4518000	4521000	What is the most challenging thing that you find?
4522000	4524000	And how do you find this work rewarding?
4524000	4525000	If so.
4526000	4528000	It's an enormous question.
4529000	4530000	How do you do this?
4535000	4538000	What's coming to my mind now is a response is with support.
4539000	4540000	Right.
4541000	4551000	And I cannot, we wouldn't have been doing this without the support of people in high intensity struggle saying go out there and do it.
4552000	4555000	So many times I wanted to quit Nate.
4556000	4566000	And you know the, I think there's a fantasy that romanticizes the communities and romanticizes like let's just leave our jobs and be off the grid.
4567000	4568000	Right.
4568000	4574000	And figure out a way to escape this and find our own space of self care.
4574000	4577000	I've been there and I was told to go back.
4578000	4583000	And to work in the belly of the beast basically.
4583000	4584000	Right.
4584000	4592000	And understanding that this is also that this, this, this work with the disease is difficult.
4593000	4602000	At one point, one of the community, one person in the community said, it's like you're working in the ivory slum.
4603000	4604000	Right.
4605000	4613000	Where there's a lot of existential, a lot of material wealth, but, but existential poverty.
4614000	4620000	And that was said with a sense of, I'm sorry for you, but you have to do that.
4620000	4622000	But if that's where you need to go.
4622000	4637000	So there's that part, but there's also the part about having a collective to before when, when this fantasies were, were at their highest.
4638000	4640000	And I really wanted to quit quit.
4641000	4643000	It was because I was working alone.
4643000	4644000	Right.
4644000	4645000	Mostly alone.
4645000	4654000	And once the collective was established ever from, from 2015 on words, and it's not a collective of affinity of identity.
4655000	4657000	It's a collective of affinity of inquiry.
4658000	4664000	And some of the things we talk about is the need for an AA for humanity.
4665000	4674000	So I have rehabilitation process and, and, and part of the commitment of this collective is not to leave ourselves off the hook.
4674000	4677000	So once you're an addict, you're always an addict, right?
4678000	4683000	So figuring out a group of people who are interested in the same kinds of experiments.
4684000	4695000	So now when I have a question or something that happens that I need support, there are a number of people in the collective, including the communities, including.
4696000	4706000	Artists, including other scholars and neuroscientists that I could actually use my WhatsApp to call and say, what do you think of this?
4707000	4708000	What, what do I do?
4708000	4724000	And to, to bounce ideas with, and we're not trying to arrive at the universal answer to be scaled up, but at experiments that might be useful five, 10 years from now, when, when the shit literally hits the fan.
4725000	4738000	Right. So that kind of commitment and, and expansion of capacity to collectively coordinate to do that is, is what we need to be able to just keep moving.
4739000	4740000	100% agree.
4742000	4751000	I could never do this work without a network and a collective that care and, and understand there's no way that a single person should, should attempt this.
4751000	4753000	The community is so essential.
4754000	4764000	I often ask people some closing personal questions, but before I do that, I'll ask you one more question based on everything you've said today.
4765000	4769000	What do we need to collectively need to learn now?
4770000	4774000	What would be your, your synopsis of, of that as a collective?
4775000	4776000	What, what is most important?
4776000	4783000	What's coming to me as a very short answer is wide boundary coordination with wisdom breadcrumbs.
4784000	4785000	That's great.
4786000	4787000	I love it.
4788000	4795000	So this has been really, really interesting and inspiring.
4796000	4801000	You have, you've got my set of Colleen going this past hour and a half.
4801000	4803000	So you've seen this podcast.
4804000	4806000	So I, I asked these questions to all my guests.
4807000	4809000	You obviously wrote a book hospicing modernity.
4810000	4818000	So you're fluent in these issues of global upheaval and anxiety, what you call hospicing, modernity in the house.
4819000	4821000	Others would call the public crisis, the permacrisis, etc.
4822000	4828000	What personal advice would you have to the viewers of this show or the listeners of this podcast during this time?
4828000	4839000	There's a question that is coming to my mind that is driving the, the sequel to hospicing modernity, which we're calling it.
4840000	4846000	The working title is outgrowing modernity, like the process of outgrowing modernity.
4847000	4856000	And the question that drives that text is this, what if you knew not only in your head, but in your bones?
4856000	4865000	That in the next 10 to 20 years, what is viable today will no longer be the case.
4866000	4875000	What is viable as a way of being and relating and exchanging and living today, especially in the global north, is no longer going to be the case.
4876000	4889000	And what if your response could be guided by a compass of emotional sobriety, relational maturity, intellectual discernment and relational and intergenerational responsibility?
4890000	4892000	What would you be doing today?
4893000	4898000	Yeah, you just start that with lots of people and we might be surprised at the response.
4899000	4912000	But they have to understand, I mean, how many people would you think truly feel it in their bones that the next 10 or 20 years, most things today are not going to be sustainable?
4913000	4919000	I mean, clearly the majority of people listening to this podcast, but in the general population of the world, I don't know.
4920000	4929000	So when I work with teachers, it is those who are looking at the levels of increased anxiety, depression and self-harm.
4930000	4931000	With students.
4931000	4932000	In the kids, yeah.
4933000	4935000	And that's got to be a lot, I would guess.
4936000	4937000	And parents.
4938000	4949000	Right, so it is coming, it's just that it's not going to be what we imagine it to be that collapse of the infrastructure happens in different ways for different people.
4950000	4960000	With me, a lot of the, and I was working in this area, so I focused on complicity and harm as my, from the beginning.
4961000	4979000	But it really, when the water reached my bum was to see my, my children, and especially when my daughter, and that this is published, so I'm not worried about oversharing.
4980000	4990000	And she's not working with me, but at 15, she was pushing back against this work like hell, putting us all through a very cruel process, right?
4991000	4997000	Because there's, it's like, you have to figure it out from the, through the fire.
4998000	5004000	And she was saying something like everything that is beautiful is being destroyed.
5005000	5013000	Being a young person today is like watching a train wreck in slow motion.
5014000	5024000	While you still want the Gucci bag, and you know the Gucci bag is a scam, but you can't interrupt the desire.
5025000	5037000	And there, the pain that you feel is like a phantom limb pain, because all the institutions around you, including the medical institution will tell you, you're okay.
5038000	5041000	Why are you feeling that pain, right?
5041000	5061000	So, as a parent, an educator, having to hold space for that without, without the child actually being open to even conversation was what got me to a point of, we have no choice.
5062000	5064000	What's, what worked before is not working anymore.
5065000	5074000	And we don't know exactly what's going to work, but there's no, there's no other choice than to try whatever you can, right?
5075000	5077000	And we can't try alone, we need to try together.
5078000	5091000	So, for the young people listening to this show in their early 20s, late teens, whatever, what advice would you have for them facing all these things we've been discussing?
5093000	5096000	My advice would be for us all, not just for them.
5097000	5100000	We need the intergenerational conversations that matter, right?
5100000	5113000	It was for my daughter, I never imagined she would come back to the work because she had made it very clear that she didn't want anything to do with me or nor.
5114000	5120000	In that kind of capacity, and now she is one of the facilitators of the facing human wrong scores.
5121000	5134000	And for her, and here I would like her to be speaking for herself and she could come with me in one of the, one of the sessions, but, and we did one together and that's what changed everything for us.
5135000	5139000	We did a series with sand together.
5139000	5168000	For her seeing it's possible for other generations to learn and learn together is what created the bind to the process, to a process that is uncertain, it's complex, it's full of frustration, but finding the joy in the struggle with others required multiple generations learning together in conversations that matter.
5169000	5181000	And that is completely aligned with our evolutionary past because we lived in communities where three generations were constantly in relationship and engagement.
5182000	5186000	Yeah, I think we've lost that in the West certainly.
5187000	5189000	And maybe it goes back to what Zach is saying.
5190000	5194000	So Zach is focusing on the intergenerational transmission of knowledge.
5194000	5198000	But when we think about transmission of knowledge, it doesn't, it's not one way.
5199000	5200000	It's both ways.
5201000	5214000	Well, and, and, and this plays a large role because you have family gatherings and the younger people are, this is a higher threshold for their attention than grandpa telling stories because these things is more interesting.
5215000	5219000	And so the technology also is relevant to all this.
5220000	5224000	What do you care most about in the world, Vanessa?
5230000	5237000	I think it's, it's just the possibility of that we can do this, like this, this is not.
5238000	5247000	Despite all the evidence that we have of the impossibility of, of, of this regeneration that is necessary.
5249000	5252000	I believe it's, it is possible.
5253000	5263000	And going back to the advice from the communities, learning to trust the invisible to make the impossible possible.
5263000	5272000	Has been extremely important, but surprising.
5273000	5280000	And when you say invisible, you could also expand that to mean the emergent, maybe things we don't understand and can't see and.
5282000	5286000	The emergent and that which is already there, right?
5287000	5295000	I don't think we will be able to imagine exactly the, in a causal way, what's going to make it happen.
5296000	5297000	I agree.
5297000	5312000	And that's why I continue to do this podcast because there's things that can't be seen or predicted that all of a sudden we are with these conversations, at least hypothetically, changing in the initial conditions of the future.
5313000	5314000	Yeah.
5314000	5323000	So if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse, what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures?
5323000	5325000	Hypothetical question.
5326000	5327000	That's a very good question.
5327000	5329000	I would need a week to think about it.
5332000	5333000	Right now.
5334000	5346000	Would be to, if remembering, we are a part of metabolism, we are the humanities, one organism.
5347000	5349000	And would be to amplify.
5353000	5357000	And I'm surprised with the answer that's coming, but serotogenic production.
5358000	5359000	Serotogenic.
5359000	5360000	Serotogenic.
5361000	5364000	So amplify the production of serotonin somehow.
5366000	5372000	Coupled with the teachings that go with that towards responsibility, right?
5372000	5379000	Because it could be sometimes serotogenic reset experiences can also be very naval gazing.
5380000	5389000	Without that intergenerational transmission of knowledge about responsibility.
5390000	5391000	Right.
5391000	5392000	So it's serotogenic.
5393000	5394000	How do you say that word?
5395000	5396000	Serotogenic.
5396000	5398000	I'm not sure if that's the right word.
5398000	5405000	Serotogenic scaling with intergenerational experience as part of a collective.
5406000	5411000	Experience, intergenerational experience, and directed towards wisdom.
5412000	5413000	Directed towards wisdom.
5413000	5415000	So let me ask you a very difficult question.
5416000	5417000	Again, hypothetical.
5418000	5431000	If everyone in the world could, without any danger, experience ayahuasca right now today, would that change the narrow boundary,
5431000	5434000	wide boundary path to wisdom?
5435000	5443000	And would it expand the sense of self to include other people, other beings, other creatures, other generations?
5444000	5445000	What do you think?
5446000	5447000	Not necessarily.
5448000	5449000	Okay.
5449000	5450000	I'm not advocating for that.
5450000	5460000	I'm just curious because I think it does connect you to a wider sense of a non-anthropocentric viewpoint of the world.
5461000	5462000	It can.
5462000	5463000	Okay.
5463000	5464000	It can, but it's not.
5464000	5474000	So there are lots of stories about failed experiments in that that we share with the communities, actually.
5474000	5478000	But one of them, I will do it very quickly because I think that's an important one.
5478000	5486000	So when the Huniqui people opened the ceremonies to Western people to come and do it there with them,
5486000	5494000	they really believed that once people did encounter ayahuasca as a spirit, as a sacred plant,
5495000	5498000	they would then become responsible towards the forest.
5500000	5501000	And that didn't happen.
5502000	5516000	So they then started asking, why aren't people able to use that reset that you have and mobilize it for responsibility?
5517000	5522000	And remember, like the other thing that Daniel said about responsibility and restraint,
5522000	5526000	this is super related to what they're talking about there, too.
5526000	5538000	So one of the ways that they explained why is that like their stories, the knowledge you need and the discipline you need to encounter this plant,
5538000	5542000	this plant in an ethical terms.
5544000	5554000	One story would take seven days and seven days of like repeating the story and understanding the different layers of the story.
5554000	5558000	And they were like, Western people don't have seven minutes of a day.
5558000	5566000	So it's because of our education system and preponderance of dopamine and all that that make us less able to have that shift?
5567000	5575000	In attachments to arbitration, authority, autonomy, like it's the effective landscape, right?
5575000	5585000	The other thing that they talk about is that, so again, people come to do to take the experience and what they are seeking is the oceanic feeling,
5585000	5599000	the oxytocin, right, of being in the womb, right, back to the womb, back where you had a parent taking care of you and all the responsibilities are externalized, right?
5599000	5606000	And he said, and you know, I says most of the ceremonies, there are ceremonies for healing childhood trauma.
5606000	5614000	It's there, but most of the ceremonies are about death and aging and more responsibility, not less.
5614000	5620000	It's the other way of life, not going back to the womb, but going back to the land.
5620000	5624000	Right. So you're only getting half of that.
5624000	5630000	And it's the responsibility part that is really the important part of what we face going ahead.
5630000	5633000	And responsibility as restraint.
5633000	5636000	Thank you so much, Vanessa.
5636000	5639000	Thank you.
