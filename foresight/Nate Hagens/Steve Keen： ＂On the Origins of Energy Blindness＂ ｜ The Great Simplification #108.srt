1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
So most of what we've seen is a growth in our wealth, our growth in the consumption levels we

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,920
have, has come from that increase in energy. And now we're cooking with gas in that sense

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,320
because we're finally acknowledging the role of energy in production. But that's not what

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:23,120
neoclassicals are doing, of course. I'd like to welcome Professor Steve Keen back to the podcast.

5
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,760
Steve is author of Debunking Economics and the New Economics of Manifesto.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,680
Steve is, among many other things, a research fellow at the Institute for Strategy, Resilience,

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,280
and Security at University College in London. He is writing a new book, and today we discuss

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:52,240
one of the chapters in his book, which is an economic sleuth story on the origins of energy

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:01:01,680
blindness. We go back all the way to Adam Smith and look at a series of wrong turns in the road

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:11,200
that neoclassical economists made on the treatment of land, energy, and things that are not

11
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,920
capital and labor. This is a difficult podcast. Steve is an economist, talks in a lot of

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,880
economist language. I barely understood what he was saying, but I did understand the critical

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:32,880
importance of his main message is that our main shaman of our culture today, those that we look

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,840
to for answers and explanations of what's happening and what will happen in the future,

15
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:44,160
are truly divorced from our biophysical and ecological reality in their formulas.

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,360
This ultimately is a really big deal. There's a chapter in Steve's upcoming book on that,

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:01,440
but this is a one and a half hour treatment of energy blindness and its origins. Please welcome

18
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:18,000
back to the show Steve Keane. Steve Keane, good to see you. Welcome to the good of you back again,

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,080
my good talk. This is a monumental podcast for three reasons. One, it's my last podcast of 2023

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,040
recording. Two, it's my first podcast on prep for a colonoscopy, so hopefully we won't have to

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,840
interrupt it too many times. And third, I think you have just finished a detective story about a

22
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,760
concept that I often talk about, energy blindness. I know the result of why our culture, why our

23
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:57,280
institutions are energy blind, but you have just written a book and a chapter on the energy

24
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,000
production function and you've gone back to the original papers from the classical neoclassical

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,760
economists and figured out why humanity has over time completely neglected the role of energy

26
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,400
in our descriptions of wealth and productivity. So we could talk about climate change, you know a

27
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
lot about that, we could talk about money and you know a lot about that and we probably should,

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,680
but today I want to just unpack your story of what you've been working on the last couple months

29
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:37,600
with respect to energy blindness. Okay, let's roll. First question. All right, so take me to the

30
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:46,240
beginning. We had classical economists back in the day, right? Yeah, and virtually every economist,

31
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,560
if you ask them who's the father of economics, going to answer Adam Smith. And in a sense, I was

32
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:58,880
inclined that way, except that I've read previous economists to Smith as well,

33
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,320
including the physiocrats. And my attitude was that the physiocrats were more advanced on important

34
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,680
issues, both macroeconomics and the role of energy in production than who were the physiocrats.

35
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,600
They were a bunch of 19th and 18th century French, mainly French, but also some Irish

36
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,080
economists who worked in French. And this is in France. And this is before we actually had

37
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,480
the term of economist in many ways. So there are people who are trying to analyze how the production

38
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:32,480
system works. And the they're called physiocrats because the leading personality, the leading

39
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,320
intellect in the group was Francois Connais. And Connais was the physician to the king of France.

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,080
And he was working at the time when we were having the very first autopsies to find out,

41
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,480
you know, what was inside a body, because for a long time in the West, there were religious

42
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,200
laws, rules against carving open a dead body. And then we started to do it. And Connais was

43
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,240
involved in this. He found all these tubes running all over the body and had this vision of a system

44
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,680
of circulation for the body. And then when it came to looking at the economy, they had the same

45
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,880
idea. There's a system of circulation, goods go from one spot to another money goes in the

46
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,800
opposite direction. And there was this sense of saying, we can see the economy is a dynamic

47
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,560
system in the same way we're now realizing the body is because all these tubes flow down and

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,600
flow back up again, the arteries go through the body, they become veins come back up again,

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,360
there's circulation of blood, there's mixing of blood with oxygen, all these sorts of things were

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,960
the vision and in that sense, the basic paradigm they started from wasn't mechanics as neoclassical

51
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,560
economists have ended up doing, it was biology. And that was a far more sensible starting place.

52
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,360
And so instead of calling them bureaucrats, they were physicians that were advising the king. So

53
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,800
they call them physiocrats. Well, the most dominant personality was Cannae. And there's

54
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,200
two combinations. He was a physician for the king, literally the king's physician. Now,

55
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,760
that did two things, gave him enormous prominence. It also gave him plenty of spare time because

56
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,680
he only got one person to occasionally have to do something medical with. So for the rest of the

57
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,600
time he was working in trying to work, and the interest was in how the economy functions as a

58
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:37,760
sort of monetary and physical goods version of a body circulation system. This was in the 18th

59
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:49,200
century in Europe? 1700s, yeah. So as people like William Petty was trying to work out how the economy

60
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:56,800
functioned in England at similar times, Sip Smith afterwards, of course. But the curious thing about

61
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,840
being based in France is that France at the time compared to Scotland, it's we're not comparing

62
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,760
France to England, but France to Scotland because of Smith. France was still overwhelmingly

63
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,240
agricultural, okay? Agriculture dominated production in France. You had, you know, some

64
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,560
level of manufacturing with nothing like what was developing in Scotland at the time. Sip Smith's

65
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,120
book came out, I think the same year as the very first James Watt steam engine was sold. And but

66
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,600
of course we had the previous models before which are much less efficient was still steam engines.

67
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,680
And you had steam power and water power and wind power being used in all the factories in Scotland.

68
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:47,040
But from the point of view of the physiocrats, they said, well, what they were looking at was,

69
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,480
you know, rural France. And what they saw was a farmer would plant one seed and a thousand seeds

70
00:07:52,480 --> 00:08:00,640
would come out of it. And so their orientation was that wealth comes from the land. And it isn't

71
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:05,120
the labor that goes into making something that gives it the value. They didn't even talk about

72
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,400
that. Well, they did, but we're as a secondary factor. So they said the source of wealth is the

73
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:17,760
land. And the husbandman as they call the farmer is the one who exploits what they call the free gift

74
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:26,080
of nature. And their perspective was first of all to say that the land is the source of all value.

75
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,920
That was the opening four or five words of Richard Cantillon's an essay on economic theory,

76
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:37,840
which was published in French 21 years before Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations.

77
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,600
First of all, for the French, not only did Smith read French, he was in France taking a young

78
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:50,960
nobleman around for education and met Cannae. So he was quite aware of the literature in French

79
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:57,920
before he wrote the Wealth of Nations. And we'll never know whether Smith derived his ideas partially

80
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,360
from the physiocrats and interactions with them, because he insisted that all his notes were burnt

81
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,600
upon his death. So we don't have any long term record of influences on Smith. But this school

82
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,960
of thought was very strong and had a definitive foundation for explaining where wealth came

83
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:23,840
from. And it wasn't from labor, it was from land. And then there was steam engines. And we were off

84
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,840
to the races. And our stories changed influenced by Adam Smith.

85
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,320
Well, that's much right in the wrong direction. Because what the physiocrats also said was,

86
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,760
because with land, they said, well, the land receives the free gift of nature. And that

87
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,600
had many potential meanings. But fundamentally, from our perspective, looking back, it was energy.

88
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,000
Because the sun's energy lands on the soil, plants absorb the energy, the plants grow,

89
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,760
the husbandman's actual labor is far less important than the productivity of the soil

90
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,480
and the exposures of natural elements, the climate, the sunshine coming in. And that was the source

91
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,560
of wealth. And they said the husbandman is the only source of wealth. And if you look at the

92
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,240
writings that people like Turgo and Candle on and can they had, and you look at it from the

93
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,400
point of view that you and I have of the role of energy and production, they are fundamentally

94
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:28,960
saying the free gift of energy is what enables us to produce anything. And what we often would

95
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,080
be called a surplus by other schools of thought is the gap between the energy put in by the husbandman

96
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,680
and the energy retrieved. And there's a wonderful sentence from Turgo, where he says the husband

97
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,480
receives the free gift of nature, which he did not pay for and which he sells. Okay.

98
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,280
Well, that's a microcosm of our entire economic system today.

99
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:54,880
Exactly. So in that sense, the physiocrats had it right. The one mistake they made,

100
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,720
and this is the thing where the whole thing fell over. And Smith played a role on this,

101
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,600
is that they could not see the same thing in manufacturing. So what they saw for manufacturing

102
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,400
is that manufacturing receives the output of the agricultural sector and transforms it to

103
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:18,480
some different form, but does not add value. Now, what we know, of course, is that manufacturing

104
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,200
also receives the free gift of nature in the sense that we're exploiting fossil fuel energy,

105
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,040
which has been there for millions of years, but it's basically stored solar power.

106
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,960
And without that input in manufacturing, there'd be no production for manufacturing either.

107
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:38,000
And at the same point, the manufacturing transformed the free gift of nature, which

108
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,840
is raw energy, into useful energy. So the sensible perspective would have been

109
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,920
to go from the physiocrats' vision of the role of agriculture to then say,

110
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,000
well, it's also in manufacturing. And Smith could have done that, because Smith could have thought,

111
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,080
well, we don't have much farming in Scotland comparatively compared to France,

112
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,960
but we do have manufacturing. And in manufacturing, we're using the free gift of

113
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,480
nature as well. We're putting coal into the early steam engines. We've got water power,

114
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,760
which is another gift of nature, wind power to some extent. But predominantly,

115
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:20,000
it was steam power and charcoal power, and coal. Coal is becoming very important,

116
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,200
becoming dominant actually, before Smith published The Wealth of Nations. So he could have said,

117
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,720
well, that's also the free gift of nature. But he didn't. What he said instead was,

118
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,920
labour is the source of value. What you have out of that is a switch from seeing

119
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,320
the external, the existing universe, being the source of us transforming the inputs we

120
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:50,000
form, find there, into something useful for us, which is consistent with the laws of

121
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
the laws of thermodynamics, into labour being the source of wealth and division of labour

122
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,040
being the source of growth of wealth. And this is all effectively inside the economy.

123
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:08,000
There's no reference to outside the economy. So I see Smith, by simply changing one word,

124
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,080
you have Richard Cantillon saying that land is the source of wealth,

125
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,560
to Smith saying labour is the source of wealth. And that completely pushed economics off the rails.

126
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,360
We can only speculate why that happened, but possibly because Scotland was

127
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,280
further along on industrialization. And all of a sudden, we had this wealth and

128
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:38,400
higher goods and services than a few decades earlier. And there was maybe a human exceptionalism

129
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:44,640
dynamic. Look at how clever we are and how industrious our citizens of Scotland are.

130
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:51,440
We're creating these machines and we're creating this productivity. And so that statement, that

131
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,240
shift from the focus of free gifts from nature to the husbandman, the farmer or the labourer,

132
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,280
that was the origin of our current energy blindness, you're saying?

133
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:08,480
I think so. I can't criticise Smith for this. I'm a great pity,

134
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,360
but I can't criticise him because he had no idea of the consequences. He didn't know

135
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,000
the laws of thermodynamics. He can't criticising for breaching something which wasn't developed

136
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
for a century after he actually spoke. But when you look at the... I'm not going to look at some of

137
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,400
the... And even the word energy was invented after he wrote Wealth of Nations, I think.

138
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,280
Did you know either 802 or 809, I think. So the word itself was taken from Greek,

139
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,080
but it was made up in the early 18th century by an English... 19th century.

140
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,360
Early 19th century. It's easy to make that mistake.

141
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,480
No, no, no. I always get that confused too. Sorry, I interrupted you. You were saying...

142
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,280
It's quite an 802. So we can't blame them for not using post-language and we can't

143
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,520
blame Smith for not knowing that there's a law of conservation of energy.

144
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,000
The story continues, though. It wasn't just Smith. The heirs compounded. So what's next?

145
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,480
Well, the next stage is once he said... Smith said that labour is a source of all value

146
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
and division of labour is the increase in value and wealth.

147
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,800
You then... Initially, that was used by Smith and Ricardo to attack feudalism and argue in favour

148
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:23,200
of capitalism. When you look at the role of the classical theory of economics played,

149
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,320
it was to promote trade, it was to promote freedom of movement and freedom of enterprise

150
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,080
against all the restrictions of the feudal system. So in that sense, it was pro-capitalist and that

151
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,120
was the way in which it was used by Smith and Ricardo. Nobody regarded... Smith and Ricardo

152
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,840
was calling for the other side of capitalism, but along comes Marx. Now, Marx... Not only Marx

153
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,960
were plenty of what they call Ricardian socialists before Marx turned up, who took the same idea

154
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,160
that if labour is a source of value, why does... Is the wage not equal to the entire product?

155
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,480
Why does profit exist? That was the twist that was then taken of the interpreting...

156
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,400
Interpreting the classical argument that labour is the source of wealth. Say, well,

157
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,880
it were the source of wealth, why don't we get it? And you have to go back and think about the state

158
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:18,960
of industry in the... In the 18th and early 19th centuries, kind of fall over that 21st century

159
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:24,240
thing in the 1900s, all the damn time. But if you think about the state of Scotland at the time,

160
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,120
if I have any analogy to what it was like, it was Calcutta in the 1950s. It was

161
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:41,280
stench everywhere from pigs being disemboweled, chemicals pumping out, smoke out of the chimney

162
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,840
stacks, et cetera, et cetera. And I've forgotten who coined the phrase of the dark satanic mills,

163
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,200
but that was what Scotland looked like at the time. And you had people who used to work in an

164
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:58,720
agricultural environment with quite a few rights that the peasants had back in that time,

165
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,320
who pushed through the enclosures movement, became landless labourers fundamentally, had to work

166
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,200
in the industrial systems, then found themselves working 14-hour days, normally six days a week,

167
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:17,040
thank God, for the Sabbath. But six days a week, often sleeping inside the factories,

168
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,120
it wasn't exactly going to conducive to making you think what a great system capitalism is.

169
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,440
On the other hand, of course, the capitalists themselves were benefiting from all this,

170
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,040
and bleeding the industrialisation and so on. And the technological change, they thought it was

171
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:38,000
great. So what you had was for the working class and for the urban poor, Ricardian and

172
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,560
Smithian economics became a ground for arguing for revolution and for a fairer share of what's

173
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:53,920
being produced. And that political shift was brought to a head by Marx in starting in 1857,

174
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:59,200
where he was prominent well before then, but 1857 with his work on what's called the Grangerisa.

175
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:08,800
And arguments for developing Marx's particular version of the classical theory. And Marx was

176
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:16,080
far more eloquent than saying capitalist exploit labour. He actually said capitalist pay workers

177
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,960
precisely what they deserve to be paid in the commodity production system. They get their

178
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:29,280
means of subsistence. That's the cost of reproducing the worker. It's again for the buyer of labour

179
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,880
power that there's a gap between labour and labour power, but by no means an injustice to the seller.

180
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,320
That's a quote from Marx. But anyway, what you got was Marx being used as the means for saying

181
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:48,560
let's have a revolution. And now in that setting, the classical school from being regarded as positive

182
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:55,440
by the capitalist class and the ruling class. The classical school being Adam Smith in the lake.

183
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:02,000
Adam Smith, Ricardo, and through to ultimately to Marx. But all the time there was a subgroup,

184
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,440
which was called, it had no particular name, but they were what I'd call proto-neoclassical

185
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,560
economists. And the most prominent would be Augustine Corner, who gave us the mathematics that

186
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,080
did what's called corner oligopoly theory and so on, comes from Augustine Corner back in the 1820s.

187
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:26,080
And Jean Baptiste, who was a complete believer in a utility maximizing view of human behavior

188
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:35,680
and equal utility maximizing view of capitalism as a system. And he was vehemently pro-capitalism,

189
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,400
which I'm not criticizing here at the moment at all, but I'm saying he had a subjective theory

190
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,440
of value, whereas the classical school was objective. So Ricardo, for example, at one stage said

191
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,880
the price of co-products are set by the cost of production and not, as has often been said,

192
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,720
by supply and demand. So Ricardo was anti-supply and demand. Most people, including the classical

193
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:06,880
economists, don't realize that. But when Marx became the bastion of the classical school,

194
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,280
this is in the 1860s and 1870s. At that stage, there was a very rapid turnover in economic

195
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,240
teaching at the universities where the subjective theory of value became dominant.

196
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,120
And it's passing on from, say, in Corner to Marshall and Jevons and Wal-Rah.

197
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,960
Can you briefly state what subjective versus objective theory of value would be?

198
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,160
The objective value theory says that the price of something is set by cost of production.

199
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,440
So they ultimately, the cost of production determines the price something sells for.

200
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,800
Whereas the subjective theory says it's a combination of the utility maximizing

201
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:50,560
desires of the buyer and the profit maximizing desires of the seller. The two together set

202
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:57,520
the price. And as Marshall ultimately says, it is as ridiculous to ask whether supply and demand

203
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:04,320
sets price as to ask which blade of a pair of scissors cuts the paper. So they saw both having

204
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,840
to play a role. But they also came down to saying that it isn't just labor that is a source of value.

205
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:15,680
Capital is also a source of value. Now, Marx, when you read Marx properly, and I think there are three

206
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,680
people have done that on one of them. Rostovsky is another. But most Marxists don't realize that

207
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:27,680
Marx actually had an explanation for how capital can add value or be a source of surplus value in

208
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,680
his terms. I won't get into that here, but that's saying the Marxists don't read Marx properly.

209
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,520
Let me ask you a clarifying question because where we're headed, we're going to talk a lot

210
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:46,400
about labor and value. Labor is pretty clear. It's the husbandman. It's the worker. Now,

211
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,040
how do you define capital back then? And is it the same today?

212
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,400
That's two of the most difficult questions in economics. Capital is fundamentally machinery.

213
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,320
Capital is a word for machinery, which we also use almost identically as a word for

214
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:11,440
money, a cumulative value of money. There is no simple mapping from the physical machines

215
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,880
to the monetary value of machines. And we'll talk a bit about how an energy approach makes

216
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,480
it easy to understand the role of machinery later in our conversation.

217
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:29,520
So with the old equations, if you substitute the word machinery for capital, and then you

218
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,120
say labor and machinery in these 19th century formulas, that would be correct. That would be

219
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,600
the same inference. That makes sense. So the Marx art, the physical machine adds no value to

220
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,640
production. This poses a distortion of his own philosophy, which is a yet another issue for

221
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,000
another day. But if you have the labor theory of value interpretation of Marx, a machine adds

222
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,640
nothing. It simply contributes to the output, what it cost to make it in the first place. And

223
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,520
there's a famous phrase in volume one of Capital, which says, no matter how productive the machine

224
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:15,680
is, if it costs 150 pounds to make or three weeks of labor, then it adds to the product 150

225
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,480
pounds or three weeks of labor. So it simply transfers its value, whereas the increase in

226
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,440
value comes from labor. That was Marx's labor theory of value argument. Now that

227
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,640
contributes to the whole political battle between workers and capitalists over who should get

228
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,840
profit, should the capitalists deserve a profit, etc, etc. And that was where the classical school

229
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,680
suddenly became on the nose for most capitalists. So the subjective arguments of Sey and Corno

230
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:52,880
and then ultimately, Vorar, Jevons and Menga became much preferred. And I really don't know the

231
00:23:52,880 --> 00:24:02,160
politics of the switch in the 1870s. But in 1850s and mid 1860s, the classical school was still

232
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:08,560
dominant at universities and dominant in public discourse. By the 1870s, it was the neoclassical

233
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,920
school, which was completely dominant. And classicals were effectively marginalized, pardon

234
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:18,880
the pun. So the marginal school takes over. And the argument is both labor and capital

235
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:25,280
contribute to production and contribute to output. So Marx actually directly or indirectly

236
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:32,800
influenced the birth of what we refer to as neoclassical takeover of economics?

237
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:37,920
Yeah. Now, when that happened, of course, the real thing I'm interested in is not Marx in

238
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,920
particular. It's a piece of particular. He's an actor in causing this, but he's not the main

239
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:51,680
stage. What started with the physiocrats had the proto version of energy as the source of value.

240
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:56,240
And that's correct. We know from the point of theory of thermodynamics, we know that

241
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,760
there is a set amount of energy in the universe. And what humanity does in its manufacturing

242
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,800
process is take significant concentrations of energy and use those to either to convert energy

243
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:17,120
something more useful or to do motive force with that energy. And that is work. And that is what

244
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,760
enables us to produce goods and services. But we cannot create energy. We take energy in one form.

245
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,200
We put it transferred into another. We actually degraded according to the second law of thermodynamics.

246
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:34,720
So there's no surplus in that sense. What there is is a gap between the energy input needed to

247
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:41,200
harness this free energy and the energy in the free that the energy contained by that free

248
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:52,080
source as well, the coal mine or etc, etc. And that is what we're we're taking advantage of.

249
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,600
So we should have an energy theory of production. And if we'd had the physiocrats, we would have

250
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,240
got there because once the physicists in that sense caught up with the economists and developed the

251
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,040
laws of thermodynamics, economists said, ah, that's what we've been talking about.

252
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,440
And we can simply integrate perfectly with that. Instead, we got the wars between labor and capital,

253
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,920
workers and capitalists over who's the who's the source of value. And that completely ignored the

254
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:32,320
role of energy. And so the neoclassical economists starting in the 1870s continued to build on this

255
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,040
separation from a biophysical physiocrat explanation of our wealth and productivity,

256
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,520
kind of at the same time that coal started to expand, we had just found oil and we started

257
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,640
the Industrial Revolution in earnest. Then what happened in the field of economics and the description

258
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,920
of our productivity and bring us gradually up to the present moment?

259
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,720
Well, you had Kanae having a theory of production, which is fundamentally a

260
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:11,040
multiplier version of investment and being multiplied by transfer between different sectors

261
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,000
and so on. The first mathematical models came out with both Marx and the classical school

262
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:25,520
and the neoclassical school. But there was still no, as we're used to today, no models,

263
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,760
no series of production, which is the mathematical equation saying, here are your inputs, there's

264
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:37,760
your GDP as output. So until that point, it was just stories and rhetoric. And all of a sudden,

265
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,200
then at the late 19th century, we started to put math to it and equations.

266
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,680
Marshall and Volra and Jevons being the main three that did that, Marshall writing into the 1920s.

267
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,000
But the first attempt to have an actual, it's called aggregate production function.

268
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,320
So trying to relate the aggregate level of output to the aggregate level of inputs at the level of

269
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,360
a macro economy, the first attempt to do that in the neoclassical school was the Cobb Douglas

270
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:15,760
production function. And in both Marshall's work and in Jevons' work, you can find this idea of

271
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,800
inputs having marginal productivity. So you put a certain amount of labor in and you get a certain

272
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:26,880
level of output, you add more labor, you get not as much increase in output as the previous level,

273
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,760
but still some positive returns. So this idea of marginal productivity of labor

274
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,240
and marginal productivity of machinery, which turned up in the neoclassical theory.

275
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:47,440
And I think in the 1890s, J.B. Clarke developed the marginal productivity theory of income

276
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:54,240
distribution, which said that workers receive the marginal product and capital,

277
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,240
capitalists receive their marginal product. And so that concept became built into neoclassical

278
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,120
theory. So the wage is supposed to reflect the contribution to output of the last worker

279
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,480
hired and the rate of profit is supposed to reflect the contribution to output of the last

280
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:17,520
meat machine turned on. But how did they know what percentage of the value of the

281
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,280
product that was created was from the worker and from the machine?

282
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:28,800
Well, they didn't actually know in that sense, and they're wrong with the answers they gave.

283
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:33,440
But the basic concept with the marginal productivity theory of income distribution

284
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,080
was that the marginal products would be based upon the share of income going to different

285
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:47,680
what economists call factors of production. So if labor gets 75% of GDP, and that was roughly

286
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,640
the term that applied in the 1920s, and capitalists get 25%, then the marginal product of labor

287
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:02,480
is 0.75 and the marginal product of capital is 0.25. So that was the general expectation,

288
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,760
but nobody put a mathematical number on it until Cob and Douglas, one being a mathematician,

289
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,080
the other being an economist. Douglas being the economist.

290
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,480
And this was 1920s, 1930s?

291
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,240
1928, I think it was. Cob and Douglas?

292
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:22,800
Yeah. So they had painstakingly assembled a set of index numbers. Again, this is why

293
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:28,320
it's important to know your history because as well as knowing how things happen, you also know

294
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,920
the context in which they happen. And today we're used to getting GDP figures off the

295
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:41,440
bureau of economic analysis every three months. And then we get a breakdown of the

296
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,600
distributions from different sectors, and there's huge tables and statisticians,

297
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,240
groups of statisticians that are involved in making this all look consistent. Back then,

298
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,000
there were no numbers. There was one person maintaining an index series for GDP,

299
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,640
but there were no numbers on the amount of labor and no numbers on the amount of machinery.

300
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:06,720
So Douglas made up fairly carefully, but put together a number of different series that

301
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,040
he could find to produce an index of labor, an index of capital, and had this index of

302
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:18,240
the output of machinery, not the entire GDP, that was preexisting at the time,

303
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:26,960
and put together the data, annual data between 1899 and 1922. And then fitted that data

304
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:31,360
with the mathematician Cobb doing the work there. Again, of course, this is on paper.

305
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,000
We probably had manual calculators back then. I imagine that would be extremely expensive.

306
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,800
They would have existed. Maybe it was done by hand, but the calculations were much,

307
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,560
much more painstaking than we're used to today by pumping numbers into a

308
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,240
computer programming, almost instantly getting the result. So just 23 numbers,

309
00:31:52,800 --> 00:32:00,080
all index numbers, all starting at 118.99, and then going through to different values in 1922.

310
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:07,040
And when they did a regression against that, they use what's called a homogenous of degree one

311
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:13,040
production function. And what that means is that you had output being some constant, and it was a

312
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:21,040
constant, not a variable, a constant, multiplied by capital raised to one power times labor raised

313
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:29,360
to one minus that power. And so the question was, what is the term? I'll call it alpha here,

314
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,080
because they use k and one minus k, and that's getting too confusing. Most economists use alpha

315
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,040
for the share of machinery in GDP, a share of capitalists in GDP. Now, back at the time,

316
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:49,360
roughly speaking, the share of capitalists in GDP is 25%. So the value for alpha is 0.25,

317
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,760
and therefore the value for one minus alpha is 0.75. And the reason it's homogenous of degree one,

318
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,840
if you multiply all labor and all capital, you double it, you get twice as much output

319
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,320
because the exponents sum to one. So that's the term they found. And lo and behold,

320
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,480
the regression came back with values of 0.76 and 0.24. And they said, hey, this is so close to what

321
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,640
we expected. That's pretty close to 0.75 and 0.25. Yeah. So they got a number which, and in fact,

322
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,600
I've redone it just using a modern program, of course, and I get exactly 0.25. So you get a

323
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,760
very strong apparent confirmation of their data. And the correlation, they gave this a correlation

324
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,560
coefficient. The r squared is the square of that, of course. And the r squared for doing it now is

325
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,800
0.94. Now, the correlation coefficient is 0.97. The response is all that looks fabulously high

326
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,280
correlation coefficient. And it fits exactly what we expected from neoclassical theory. Now,

327
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,720
they got a lot of pushback initially, but that was a major reason for why it became so popular,

328
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,960
because the results looked very strong and they supported neoclassical theory.

329
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:08,240
But the entire formula was based on a data set from 1899 to 1922.

330
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,560
Yep. And what Colburn Douglas did, they showed the numbers, the regression for

331
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:28,160
regressing GDP against the index for capital and the index for labor. But they said that their

332
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:37,760
change data also gave the same correlation coefficient at 0.97. And what they used was not

333
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,600
what we do use today, which is the annual change in the indices would take the log and

334
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,880
the log difference. Or you'd, they'd look at percentage rate of change and say,

335
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:54,080
what's the percentage rate of change? That, when you do it, and this is where I start finding a

336
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,080
bit of, you know, there's a hole in the bucket, derelizor, derelizor. The correlation coefficient

337
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:08,880
that they claimed was 0.97 for exactly the same value of alpha. So you got a, you know,

338
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,280
higher at confirming, you didn't just get the high correlation with what's your GDP and out labor

339
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,680
and capital, which are all growing. Okay. So there's a good, you know, the fact that they're all

340
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,760
rising at the one time will give you a higher correlation. They said same correlation coefficient,

341
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,640
same value for alpha. When I do it over the alpha minus 0.15.

342
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,160
And why is that? Because they didn't use the annual, the percentage change. They used the

343
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,600
three year moving average. And I don't know, there would be, you know, we can't, I wouldn't

344
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,840
be able to find the original notes, but it wasn't the, the same result that they got for the

345
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,680
data, which was all rising at one time. And any statistician will tell you that if you have data,

346
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,720
which is all rising, you're going to get a high correlation coefficient

347
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,840
just because they're all growing, not because they're related to each other.

348
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,560
So we should be looking for the differences and try to get something where the trend

349
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:08,080
should be around zero. And, and even that doesn't apply to the first differences here.

350
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:13,440
But it's, in other words, they didn't get the results that people accepted that they did.

351
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,640
And the confidence people had in their results wasn't justified.

352
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:26,800
But people were confident. Like in the 1930s and 1940s, this was considered a valid and profound

353
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,200
explanation of the inputs and outputs of an economic system describing our wealth and productivity.

354
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,680
Yeah. Now we had all sorts of other approaches to how you model production in the meantime.

355
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,440
And there was a long time, and this actually still applied when I was doing my PhD back in the 1980s

356
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:50,320
or 1990s, that the neoclassical economists were doing what they call computable general

357
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,360
equilibrium models. And these models had an input-output table as part of their production

358
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:59,120
system. Now that's all sorts of issues for them, which we dig in that's

359
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,720
tangential to what we're talking about. But at the same time, you had the rise of the,

360
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,440
what they call, called themselves the new classical economists. And these were neoclassical

361
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,960
economists who wanted to revive the idea of the market economy being perfectly flexible,

362
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,840
get rid of this nasty Keynesian stuff. And they started using, much more commonly,

363
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,320
the Cobb-Douglas production function, because they replaced an input-output model for the

364
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,160
production today with the idea of production over time. And they went back to a single commodity

365
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,480
idea. This is the aggregate production function. Of course, they used the Cobb-Douglas production

366
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,920
function. Now, we've had 30 or 40 years of that, and typical neoclassicals, they don't know their

367
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,160
own history. They've forgotten they ever used anything different to that. And all of them

368
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,280
use a Cobb-Douglas production function. And they've all done what Solo brought in in the 1950s.

369
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,120
And that's bringing in what they call technological change as part of the system. So they have

370
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:04,160
output as a product of the state of technology, which they use the capital that are A for,

371
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:12,080
multiplied by labor to 1 minus alpha times capital to alpha. And that's where I think

372
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:15,840
everything went wrong. Not that there was already going wrong with Cobb-Douglas, but

373
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,440
this is where you got myths taking over economics. Well, it was already going wrong with Adam Smith.

374
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:25,680
Yeah. It's era after era. I can define economics as compound era.

375
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:34,240
All right. We're going to eventually translate all this because I'm mostly tracking with,

376
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,160
I mean, you're an economist and you're a friend and you care about the system of humans and our

377
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,960
planet. But you're also here, you're functioning as a historian, which is a totally separate skill

378
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,440
that you have. And I've talked to you offline on what you've all been working on. And it's

379
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,240
quite the detective story. So keep going and bring us up to the present. So what did Solo do?

380
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,560
Well, you started with the Cobb-Douglas having their function was a constant,

381
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,520
multiplied by alpha the 1 minus alpha times K to the alpha as the production function.

382
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,960
Now, then one of the criticisms that was made of Cobb-Douglas by other neoclassicals is always

383
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,720
technological change here. And Solo said, well, we can bring technological change in. This is in 1956

384
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,280
and says 57. We can bring it in. And the way we have to do it, there's a cost to actually read

385
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,840
them here. The new wrinkle I want to describe is an elementary way of segregating variations in

386
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:42,880
output per head due to technical change than those due to changes in the availability of

387
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,480
capital per head. Naturally, every additional bit of information has its price. In this case,

388
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,160
the price consists of one new required time series to the share of labor in total income

389
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,720
and one new assumption. And here we go. That factors are paid their marginal products.

390
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,040
There was rather than being a mathematical derivation by Cobb-Douglas that alpha is 0.25 and

391
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,920
1 minus alpha is 0.75. Let's just assume that they're what the current values of the share of

392
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,080
labor and capital in output are. Alpha is 0.3, which means capital is to get 30% of output and

393
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:29,520
labor gets 0.7. So we just assume that. And then we fit the data to the, we have a data series for

394
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,760
labor, a data series for capital, a data series for GDP. We don't have technology. So the gap

395
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:44,160
between the result we get for GDP and the sum of labor and capital is what they call the growth

396
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:51,760
of technological change. And that ended up being 0.85. So 85% of the variation in output

397
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,840
was explained not by the proportions of labor and capital to each other, but by this technological

398
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:04,240
component. And that became known as a solar residual. So hold on a second. So from 1928 onwards,

399
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:13,280
they had 75% was described by labor and 25% by capital of our productivity.

400
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,400
Productivity is basically could be, could be said our wealth change year over year. Then

401
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:28,960
30 years later, they changed it and said that 85% is, is unexplained, but it's by some change in

402
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:37,840
technology. Yeah. And how does technology, how does technology in, in, in, in solos definition

403
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,120
versus your definition, how does technology differ from capital?

404
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,200
Well, this is the problem. Technology, in my opinion, is embodied in the capital.

405
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,520
In that sense, when we have technological change, we get as new machines that have a

406
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,840
higher capacity to process energy and produce more complex goods than the previous ones had.

407
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,760
So Cobb and Douglas were, in that sense, right, not to differentiate out technology and capital,

408
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,600
but by solar bringing in this idea of a residual. First of all, he assumed that the

409
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,320
exponents for labor and capital were given by income distribution data. By that stage,

410
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:22,880
it was 30% going to capitals rather than 25%. So he did do data from, from the 1920s to the 1950s

411
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,800
at the, the 0.25, 0.75 shifted to 0.3 and 0.7. That's what he found when he's looking at his,

412
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,960
his, in his paper, he does include the national distribution of income. And it's pretty much

413
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,440
the 30%, 70% capitalists and workers. But he found, he looked at the numbers and said,

414
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,120
wait a minute, there's something not right here. And when you find a residual of something,

415
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:51,280
a residual effect, sometimes it's 5% or 10%. But in his case, it was 85%.

416
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,360
85%. The vast majority of the productivity was not just, could not be described by capital and

417
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:04,160
labor. Well, actually 87.5% national paper. And that's, that's okay in one sense. You can say,

418
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,480
well, the most of our improvement isn't because of adding more labor or more capital or getting

419
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:14,160
the ratio between labor and capital correct. It's technological change. But fundamentally,

420
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,280
that was because technological change turns up on the machines. And you think the labor component,

421
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,680
when we're talking about unskilled workers, you basically have people working on a process line.

422
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,040
I've actually done that at some stage in my youth. But, you know, you just get told,

423
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,920
now press this button, pull this lever, press that put that, dig that hanging magic and that

424
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,520
watch them or call it. And that's your role. Okay. So what, where the technological change

425
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,160
actually turns up as the machine itself. So if you go back before I worked as a manual

426
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:55,040
hand inside a factory, one search, you would have used rivets to weld aluminium together. And now

427
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,440
you're using spot welding machines. And so the technology is actually embodied in the machinery.

428
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,480
And this is where the confusion of machines with money becomes a reason why you,

429
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,840
your mind gets clouded if you don't distinguish the two. But the terms we use, capital for machinery

430
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:19,440
and capital for money, and capitalists for the social class, does confuse the matters.

431
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,760
And what I'm talking about is progressive confusion.

432
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,240
Yeah, I'm a little confused myself now, but I know you're telling a really important story,

433
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,160
which you outlined to me on the phone. I mean, on our call earlier this week. So keep going.

434
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:45,200
And by the way, from Marx onward, Marx and Cobb and Douglas and Solo in the 1950s,

435
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,240
they're all using terms like land and capital and technology. And the word energy is found nowhere

436
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,400
in these papers, correct? The only one who really does, I mean, for example,

437
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,680
Marshall talks about energy. He uses the word 79 times in his Principles of Economics. Every last

438
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,680
time talking about the innovative spirit of humans, not energy. Right, energy is our,

439
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,840
is our, yeah, not fossil energy, but the human spirit. Yeah, human spirit. So he actually talked

440
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:24,240
about energy as various raw materials, which of course contain energy, coal and oil as inputs.

441
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,440
But when it came to talking about energy itself, there was no awareness of the theories of

442
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:36,000
thermodynamics or the, the role of energy as a production force. Whereas in Marx, Marx was actually

443
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,280
reading the early thermodynamic workers and going to lectures in London and so on. So there's more

444
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,480
awareness of the role of energy in Marx than there is in the neoclassicals. But what's happened

445
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,880
is energies dropped completely out of the picture at this stage. So first of all, Cobb and Douglas

446
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:57,440
give you a theory of production, which fits the marginal productivity theory of income distribution.

447
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:02,320
They give you coefficients, which are what neoclassicals expect them to do,

448
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:07,120
but they're derived from the data. And then along comes a cell and said, let's assume those

449
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:14,480
coefficients are correct. So the marginal product of labor is 0.7 and it is equal to their

450
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:20,320
contribution, their share of GDP. And then let's work out the residual on, oh my God,

451
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,200
87.5. But that's okay. We're talking about technological change. But it was an unnecessary

452
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,080
fudge. And it then shielded neoclassical economists from looking at the data again

453
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:38,560
to see whether the share of workers in GDP is equivalent to the contribution that labor

454
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:46,160
makes to output and capital makes to output. And that's where it goes all orry, because when you

455
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:53,360
take a look at the data that solar was looking at and data subsequent to that, and you do a regression

456
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:58,160
based on the change in white GDP, the change in labor and change in capital,

457
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:04,320
rather than getting a coefficient for labor of capital of 0.3, which is close to the income

458
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:10,880
distribution, you get a coefficient for capital of 0.85. And that suddenly means hang on a sec,

459
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:17,120
we've got a contradiction between an empirically derived term for the contribution of capital to

460
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:24,080
output and the theory of income distribution. The return to capital is actually much higher.

461
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:32,400
So the the exponent for capital is much higher than capital share in GDP. And suddenly,

462
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,880
we would have seen this if solar hadn't jumped in with the idea of separating our technological

463
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:48,480
change from capital itself. So that was like red herring that took us down a different flawed

464
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,640
pathway on understanding the production function. So what happened after? Go ahead.

465
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,040
We're leaving energy out all the way through. So what we have is in the neoclassical camp,

466
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,960
the idea that labor and capital get the payment of the labor and capital affects

467
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,000
their marginal product becomes just ingrained in the mindset of neoclassicals. And they stick

468
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,280
with the coefficients that that solar first worked on in 1957, and half a century still today,

469
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,920
still today, they haven't changed them. So if you look in any almost any neoclassical paper,

470
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,520
it will assume the exponent for capital is 0.3, and the exponent for labor is 0.7.

471
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,680
Using data that's that's solo used from 1928 to 1950s.

472
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,120
Yeah, if anybody's smart, they might go and take a look at the income distribution and find that

473
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:45,280
capital now gets 40% and labor gets 60%. So they change to the 0.4 and 0.6. But they simply

474
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,440
assume they can use the income distribution data to choose what the exponents are on the

475
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,560
production function. When you're getting a PhD in economics today, or when you were in school,

476
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:03,520
was it a requirement to read these fundamental papers of Marshall and Cobb Douglas and Marx and

477
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,880
no, no, I mean, that's one of the reasons why neoclassical economics has gone so totally off

478
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,280
the rails, they don't even know their own history. And so they did, if you go to a like when I went

479
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:20,960
through, you had to sit through master's courses on advanced micro and advanced macro and so on,

480
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:27,680
they were part of, there's now what's called an America ABD, all but dissertation. So you do,

481
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,520
and the American system has enormous coursework load, and I'm not sure, thankfully, they didn't

482
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,680
go through the American system. But I think something like two thirds of your time is spent

483
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,320
doing courses rather than writing a thesis. And in you don't go back, the oldest paper you might

484
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,720
read is one where the Lucas critique was developed in the 1970s. So they just don't know their own

485
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:58,240
history. What's the Lucas critique? There's another rabbit hole, but arguing that microeconomic

486
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:02,960
macro should be based on micro, that's the fundamental idea behind the Lucas critique.

487
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:13,280
Okay, so from Adam Smith, to Marx, to Marshall, to Cobb and Douglas, to Solo,

488
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:22,080
we've had a progression away from the physiocrats of something physical. Back in France,

489
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:29,760
it was land and the free energy from the earth. And then we had a bonanza of fossil carbon added

490
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,840
to our economic system. What happened next? Solo all the way to the present day, or was there

491
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:40,160
another? Solo all the way to the present day, in terms of production and function that neoclassicals

492
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,760
use. And then, of course, energy, we've got to bring our people back to energy all the time,

493
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,400
because the thing is, what happened to energy? We know energy is absolutely critical for production,

494
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:56,560
but it's left out of these theories. And you then had a group of non-orthodox economists,

495
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:04,000
Bob Ayers being the main one, a physicist who became fascinated with economics, and then

496
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,680
realized economics didn't include the role of energy and thought we've got to bring energy

497
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:12,320
into production, working with Coomble and quite a range of other non-orthodox economists.

498
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,720
I know both Bob and Reiner. And so did I. And you. Yeah.

499
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,840
So for our Bob Harding, what about three, four weeks ago?

500
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,240
I know. I know. I saw that. Maybe two months ago. Now, I'm glad I got to see him.

501
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,320
Would have been only two months before he died in Holland at a conference that we caught up.

502
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:35,360
So working with Bob, I thought we've got to bring energy in. There simply has to be a way

503
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:41,360
of bringing energy into production. And what Coomble and Bob were doing was, at some point,

504
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:46,880
they went from using total numbers to index numbers in what they call the Linux production

505
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,600
function. This was the attempt to bring energy in, but through the legs of the Cobb Douglas

506
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:59,200
production function. So at some point, they had the idea of index number values for output, labor,

507
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,760
energy and capital being part of the way they derived the Linux function.

508
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:10,080
And my discomfort was that fundamentally what they were doing, and this is what neoclassicals

509
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:15,120
themselves have also done, is add energy in as an additional factor of production.

510
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,200
So you see the way you produce output is you combine labor and capital and energy.

511
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,840
Now, there's two problems with that. One is that if you combine labor independently and

512
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:32,160
machinery independently and energy-produced independently, you don't have output. You've

513
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:39,040
got an explosion. Energy has to be an input to labor and capital. And so what finally occurred

514
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,480
to me, literally while being in Bob, is this flat in France, which was full of statues,

515
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,920
the walking through it one day and a trip from the bathroom, the little thought popped in my brain,

516
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,360
labor without energy is a corpse, capital without energy is a sculpture. And bang, that's it.

517
00:52:55,360 --> 00:53:01,760
And I sat down at a table, five minutes typing in a program called MathCat, as it happens,

518
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:07,840
and feed that into the Cobduckers production function. So the basic idea was that energy is

519
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:13,200
not an independent factor. It's a factor you have to input to labor in one form and input

520
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,880
into machinery in a different form. Otherwise, they can't produce anything.

521
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:24,160
So it said differently, the laborers need food and housing and shelter and such,

522
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:30,960
and the machine's capital need to be turned on and powered by electricity or heat or movement,

523
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,680
absolutely requires energy. Without energy, the machines are worthless.

524
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,080
Yeah. Now, what then happened out of that was that in the Cobduckers production function,

525
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:48,080
if I fed energy as an input to labor, the basic point was that the number of workers you've got

526
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:53,360
times how much energy they consume multiplied by how much of that energy is used in production.

527
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:59,120
Now, if we go back to the days of the Roman slaves, most of the energy they consumed went

528
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:08,000
into production. Now, Feta-Pittons worked to the bone, and therefore, if they got given like

529
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,480
200 watts equivalent of energy input, they could put out 100 watts output, and so their factor is

530
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,520
50%. But if you fast forward today, you and I are surrounded by energy. We're consuming tens of

531
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:26,480
thousands of watts of energy in our houses with our devices, the heating, hot water, etc., etc.

532
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,960
But only a tiny amount of our energy actually now goes into production. And fundamentally,

533
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,160
the amount of physical work we can do runs out at about 100 watts. And I'm terrible on the terms,

534
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:41,760
by the way, being an economist, I haven't been properly trained on the terms of energy and

535
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,320
watts and jewels and so on. So I'll make all sorts of mistakes there. But the basic point is

536
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:53,200
the energy input of a worker to production is in terms of actual measures of energy is no greater

537
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,880
than it was 2000 years ago because we haven't evolved in any sense to be able to consume more

538
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:04,080
energy and output more energy. On the other hand, machinery has had an incredible increase in the

539
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:12,240
energy input that I mean, sharing can take. My favorite instance, I like what Musk is doing

540
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:18,640
with SpaceX. So I'm a bit of a space junkie. And a friend of mine was being abusive about this

541
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,720
last rocket blowing up. And I finally, I worked out what was the energy equivalent of the energy

542
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:31,120
inside that rocket was one third of a Hiroshima bomb. Now, for that to actually not lead to an

543
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:37,280
explosion, the devastated Boca Chica, but led to a rocket taking off and reaching 100 kilometers

544
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:43,680
above the surface in a few minutes, that is the amount of energy that the ultimate machine of

545
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:51,440
our day can consume. If you go back to James Watt steam engine, it was about 30 tons of coal a day.

546
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,400
Now, that's a dam site less than one third of a Hiroshima Hiroshima bomb. So most of what we've

547
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,360
seen is a growth in our wealth, our growth in the consumption levels we have have come from that

548
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,840
increase in energy. And now we're now we're cooking with gas in that sense, because we're

549
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:11,680
finally we're acknowledging the role of energy in production. But that's what may not what

550
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:23,840
neoclassicals doing, of course. So this was a story of kind of false turns at at intersections all

551
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:30,480
the way. And now, what would what would a neoclassical economist listening to this

552
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:40,640
last 45 minutes of say to you in in rebuttal or defense or contradiction or alarm?

553
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,320
I'm going to get a bit of fun here. Rudy, if you're listening, Rudy Bachman

554
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:50,800
sold me the case of saying what a neoclassical economist would say by actually saying what he

555
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:56,160
said in a paper, because now I'm going to come down to how have economists on the very few occasions

556
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:00,080
they've tried to include energy in a Cobb Doctor's production function, what they've done and

557
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,840
therefore deduced about the role of energy and production. And I really think I haven't got

558
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:11,200
a sense of him, but I laugh at him all the time. So I want to show what I do that. So Bachman and

559
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,040
Co, about three or four authors wrote a paper for German, a German work language working

560
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:22,720
paper with an English translation on the issue of what's going to happen to output in GDP of

561
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:29,280
Germany, if we're caught off from Russian energy during the Ukraine war. And the argument they

562
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,560
made was that was done by saying, we're going to include energy in the Cobb Doctor's production

563
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:40,160
function. Now what they did, and this is where the mistakes compound upon mistakes, is they took

564
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:49,520
the standard coefficients of 0.7 and 0.3 and then said, let's allocate 0.04 of the capital's

565
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:55,280
coefficient to energy. So you still got the same homogenous production. Because energy is four percent

566
00:57:55,360 --> 00:58:02,880
of four percent of GDP. Therefore, okay, the coefficient is 0.04. And this is where you get

567
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,800
the total, this is where the twist comes in. Because the coefficient is 0.04, the mathematics

568
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,520
of the Cobb Doctor's production function that entails you, that the contribution of energy

569
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:20,800
to change in output is also 0.04. But all of the labor and all the machinery is fully dependent

570
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:25,200
on the energy. Far more important. Now here, I'm going to get some quotes out of Rudy here.

571
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:33,600
Okay. So they compared their work to the, what's called the Lyontia production function,

572
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,600
which we haven't even mentioned yet, but I'll bring that in now. And Lyontia,

573
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:41,920
vassally Lyontia, was one of the few winners of the Nobel Prize that I absolutely applaud.

574
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:47,760
He was a Russian mathematician, stroke economist, and he gave us input, output analysis, and a whole

575
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,840
range of other positive contributions. But when looking at the ratio, a good level of capital,

576
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:58,320
a level of output in most economies doing whatever, how other than others were developed,

577
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,480
what he realized was the ratio of labor to capital to output was roughly constant,

578
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,480
different between different countries, very different between developing and developed

579
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,040
countries. But generally speaking, the ratio, whichever your way was roughly constant. And

580
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:17,440
he then said you could use that as an aggregate production function. So rather than saying the

581
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,440
aggregate level of output is, you know, labor to one power times capital one minus that power,

582
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,480
you said output is capital divided by capital output ratio. And it was just an empirical

583
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:35,040
regularity. And the post Keynesian school, which I'm part of, basically said that'll be our production

584
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:40,560
function. So rather than the complicated neoclassical with, you know, exponents and marginal products,

585
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:46,720
et cetera, et cetera, we just say output is K divided by V. And V, normally in terms of the

586
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,920
conventional figure, people normally used about point about three for the value of V. So output

587
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,600
each year is one third the value of capital that same year. And that's what near and then we get

588
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:03,120
ridiculed for that. And because it's all you don't enable the possibility of substitution between

589
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,520
labor and capital as input. So you must be less sophisticated than we are with the

590
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,920
production function that can enable for substitution of labor for capital.

591
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,000
So Rudy then dived in, and Rudy, which I've dived in this and took a look and compared

592
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,520
the Cobb Douglas production function to the Leontief using a form which is called constant

593
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:28,480
elasticity of substitution. But I won't go into that basically in regard the Cobb Douglas is one

594
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:36,880
extreme of that and the Leontief at the other. And they said that if you, if you have the

595
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,240
standard Cobb like this production function, then it tells you to have a 10% fall in energy

596
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:51,600
inputs, you will have a 0.4% fall in GDP. So we lose 10% of our energy and GDP goes down by 0.4%.

597
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:59,760
Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's ridiculous. I know. You and I both know that's ridiculous. But he didn't

598
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:06,560
know that because they don't look at the data. So what they then said was that, and this is the

599
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:11,440
quote from Rudy's paper, it's in the heading as extreme scenarios with low elasticity of

600
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:19,600
substitution and why Leontief production at the macro level is nonsensical. So they had the blue

601
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,560
dashed line and the figure shows that output falls one for one with energy supply into the Leontief

602
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:29,520
case. The marginal product of energy jumps to one over alpha, which is the exponent they use for it,

603
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,400
so one over 0.04. Well, the marginal products of the other factors falls to zero and then

604
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,480
is an assumption. If factor prices equal marginal products, this then implies the price of energy

605
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,920
jumps to one over alpha and prices of others fall to zero. This also implies expenditure energy

606
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:50,800
jumps to 100%, blah, blah, blah. We consider these predictions to be economically nonsensical.

607
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:56,800
They are, but not because the Leontief case is wrong. The Leontief actually fits the data.

608
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,200
It's because the assumption that wages equal marginal product of labor is wrong.

609
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:07,520
So it's an empirical contradiction of the neopastical theory of production.

610
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:17,040
And the basic argument is that they think that production is quite insensitive to energy. That's

611
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:24,720
also a quote from the paper. So because the exponent of 0.04, that means that 10% change in

612
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:32,240
energy causes 0.4% change in output. So labor is far more significant than capital

613
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:38,560
second and energy of far distant third. When you look on the data, energy is 100% of the answer.

614
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:45,280
Explain that. I mean, what is the truth based on all your work with Bob Ayers and Reiner Kuhl

615
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:53,920
and others? What is the actual equation of labor and capital and whatever other variables?

616
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,920
The basic truth is that the output is fundamentally energy transformed into a useful form.

617
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:07,040
If you take a look at the rate of growth of energy, the rate of change of energy,

618
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:13,360
and the rate of change of GDP at the global level, you find a correlation coefficient for them.

619
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:21,200
I'm looking for this now of 0.7 roughly. And the relationship between change in GDP

620
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:29,120
and change in energy is 0.97 times change in energy. So in other words, fundamentally,

621
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:37,200
what GDP is, is energy transformed into useful work. And so the core flawed assumption, which is

622
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:50,640
taken, built upon some basic flawed assumptions and changed over centuries, is that we can describe

623
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,080
our wealth. I mean, it's almost like there's been a supernova the last two centuries of energy

624
01:03:56,080 --> 01:04:00,960
use and wealth and productivity. And people are just trying to scramble in real time putting

625
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:10,480
math equations on that and increasingly divorced from the truth because the supernova keeps growing.

626
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:20,400
And so the energy blindness is that adding more energy, particularly energy dense,

627
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:28,160
fossil energy to the whole thing every year, that itself, that little addition of more energy

628
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:33,840
is a big explainer of our productivity. It's the fundamental explainer. And therefore, if we,

629
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:37,760
and what we've really done over time is develop machines which can handle more and more energy,

630
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,040
more and more precisely, that's where our wealth has come from. And we've, again, economists have

631
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:48,320
been blind to that by having this, first of all, inversion by David Smith to throw out the physiocrats

632
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:53,600
and say, labor is the source of value. And then you have the neoclassical saying it's labor and

633
01:04:53,600 --> 01:05:01,440
capital. Then you had Cobb and Douglas saying it's 0.7 and 0.3, which means that the contribution

634
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:08,080
of labor to change in output is 70%. And the contribution of capital is 30%. That then gets

635
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:14,080
locked in by a solo to turning their empirical nondiscovery into an assumption and then putting

636
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:20,400
it all in technological change which becomes disembodied from capital itself, but also hides

637
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,360
them from the fact that the relationship doesn't hold up on the data anymore anyway. And now,

638
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:29,360
when they come bringing energy, they just tack it on as a third factor and give it a coefficient

639
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:36,000
based on the percentage of energy in GDP, which is trivially low, and therefore say energy has

640
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,080
almost no role in production, which is complete bollocks. And part of the reason is that the

641
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:50,960
energy input into our machines and into our economy is only the cost of energy that it is to

642
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:58,160
extract, plus a little profit for the oil company or whatever. It's not the value that it provides,

643
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:03,280
which is four or five years of my physical labor and all that.

644
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:13,760
Yeah, I mean, seriously, this is Nobel Prize sort of observation,

645
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:22,160
I think, because it's so decoupled from what people say at high positions of authority in our

646
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:30,240
world. Again, I'll ask you what is just a standard economist, not Rudy, someone you know, but just

647
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:36,480
anyone listening to this who has a PhD in economics or maybe someone who's in grad school

648
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:40,720
getting a master's or a PhD in economics listening to this program,

649
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:49,120
is their initial reaction going to be one of critical rejection? Steve doesn't know what

650
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:55,120
he's talking about, or is it like, yeah? Absolutely. I mean, because it affects their

651
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:59,040
identity or because they know otherwise in their research? It affects their identity. I mean,

652
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,160
if a younger one might actually go, oh, hang on, that's surprising, you'll get a few who might

653
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:09,280
react that way and change, but the old ones are locked in their ways. Okay, so speak to the

654
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:15,440
young ones right now. If they're curious about this and something doesn't sit right with what

655
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:22,960
they've been told and what they've just heard, what would you recommend that they do to get clarity

656
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,720
on the truth? The main thing is to realize that economics can't be derived from the laws of

657
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,360
thermodynamics, but it can't be inconsistent with them either. And what you're being taught within

658
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:38,720
your production functions and so on is leaving out the role of energy in an absolutely critical way.

659
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,080
Now, if you go and want to do it empirically, you're going to take a look at what is the

660
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:47,600
relationship between energy and production, drive it empirically, and you'll find that

661
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:54,640
it's somewhere between like a point in GDP is 0.7 to say 0.95 minus 0.97 as I got in that particular

662
01:07:54,640 --> 01:08:03,040
Excel regression of the value of change in GDP. So the fundamental insight from a thermodynamical

663
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:09,440
point of view within economics is that the first to a first approximation, GDP is energy

664
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:15,520
turned into useful work. And then that means that the whole argument you were taught in

665
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,640
neoclassical economics that the wage reflects the marginal product of labor is completely wrong.

666
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:27,360
The wage and the return to capital for that matter have nothing to do with their contribution to

667
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:33,920
production. What labor and capital do is harness energy successfully in factories to produce output.

668
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:39,120
And that will normally be done with machines that machines have very

669
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:47,280
fixed ratios of per workers per machine and energy throughput per machine. So fundamentally,

670
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:53,040
you get a fixed ratio on that sense. Leonty is an empirical observation we now have an explanation

671
01:08:53,040 --> 01:09:01,280
for that explanation is that the Leonty production function is actually output is equal to machinery

672
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:05,600
multiplied by the efficiency with which machines turn energy into useful work.

673
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:13,280
Neoclassical economists I mean back when I was in school are among the smartest people in my class

674
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:22,880
and smart people can be fooled, but they're not dumb. So like really, it still today boggles

675
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:30,320
my mind how neoclassical economists can totally neglect energy given anyone with three minutes

676
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:38,400
on the internet can find that a barrel of oil has 5.7 million BTUs in it, which is a lot of energy

677
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:44,480
relative to the 0.6 kilowatt hours that I do per day. So what do they really think this?

678
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,440
They really do and the trouble is this is where your mind gets set by your training.

679
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,520
So if you get trained on the idea that production is a combination of technology,

680
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:58,560
labor and capital and energy doesn't even turn up there, you don't even think about energy and

681
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,520
you can be completely energy blind in the sense that I now lead that book with that it would like

682
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,280
where we know humans know better much about energy as fish do about water,

683
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:12,320
they simply take it for granted. And then you see this when neoclassicals actually come to pose

684
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:15,920
themselves the question of what is the role of energy in production. So this is again,

685
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:22,080
this is from the paper by Back When and Co about the impact of the loss of Russian energy on German

686
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:27,760
output and they to take the Klobdokos production function and differentiate it with respect to

687
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:34,880
the inputs and then say that we can say what's going to happen to GDP from a change in energy

688
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:40,320
and here's a quote from the paper. Therefore, for example, a drop in energy supply of minus 10

689
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:47,360
percent reduces production by 0.4 percent, which shows that production is quite insensitive to

690
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:56,400
energy as expected. This is expected. Production is quite insensitive to energy as expected.

691
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:05,040
Expected on neoclassical economists. Right, it's a tautology of sorts. It's a tautology. They think

692
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,920
that energy has a trivial role because it has no role in their production function. But when you

693
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:18,160
revise it... Why aren't there people calling them on this? Like a... Well, I am. The Prime Minister

694
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:25,680
or a Senator or a CEO. They all do one unit of economics. They all get the idea of labor and

695
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:30,560
capital producing output and the production function if they go that detailed in first year.

696
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:36,560
But fundamentally, they get taught the whole idea that we get paid our factor products and that

697
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:43,520
actually ideologically is very reinforcing for a CEO because it says my enormous weight per salary

698
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:48,880
is because of my huge contribution to production. So it ends up having an ideological role and that

699
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:57,120
lines them to the physical reality that you simply don't have that impact on production.

700
01:11:57,120 --> 01:12:01,520
If you come down to the nuts and bolts of it, it's energy which is producing the output

701
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,160
and you are getting a share of it and now an overblown share given your system and the power

702
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:13,440
structure of capitalism. So if we truly defined energy correctly in the production function,

703
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:21,600
that giant gift from nature might not all be funneled to the top the way it is now.

704
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:27,360
And that of course leads to one of the reasons why people continue being energy blind because

705
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:34,720
it enables them to be blind to their outsized share of the wealth of the civilization

706
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:43,440
that goes their way. And also continues to indicate why we're blind to the waste component

707
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:49,760
as well because if you include that, that reduces. Yeah. The other side of the production

708
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:56,160
function is waste and when I do the ontario function which makes sense with the empirical

709
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:01,360
interpretation or the logical reinterpretation of the empirical regularity of the ontario

710
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:07,200
that output is capital divided by capital output ratio, the coming output is capital times the

711
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:13,760
efficiency with which machines turn energy into useful work, that coefficient is going to be less

712
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:20,640
than 0.5, substantially less than 0.5. So it means most of what we've used is waste, waste energy.

713
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:26,160
It can quantify it and say if the energy, the efficiency with which machines turn energy

714
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:34,480
useful work is about roughly 0.2 or 0.25, then 0.8 to 0.75 is of energy input produces waste.

715
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,440
And that's what we dump into the environment and that of course feeds back and damages our

716
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:46,160
capacity to produce output. If we had that inside 50 or 60 years ago, we would never have got to

717
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:52,560
the conundrum where we are now overlying so much upon fossil fuel energy for our production today.

718
01:13:53,360 --> 01:13:59,440
Okay. I'm going to ask you an easier question but it might be a harder question for you specifically,

719
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:10,000
Steve. What would you tell to a graduate student learning about the world in another discipline

720
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:17,840
like philosophy or French or chemistry or biology who will never take a class in economics?

721
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:27,920
Can you, to those people, why is it important that energy underpins the production function

722
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:34,320
and that our economists and therefore our politicians and such have been misled about the

723
01:14:35,040 --> 01:14:39,360
the core driver of our wealth the last century plus?

724
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:45,520
Fundamentally, humans as the lasation only exists because we exploit energy. If we didn't have

725
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:52,160
energy in the form of the coal and oil deposits we found, we would still be sitting around

726
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:59,680
fireplaces starting fires with flints. We might have moderately sophisticated culture to the

727
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:06,320
stage that you got with your animal power and slave power under Romans and the medieval period

728
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:11,360
and serfs and so on. But there wouldn't be the philosophy, there wouldn't be the art,

729
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:15,920
there wouldn't be the computers that we take for granted today. So if we don't understand

730
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,120
the role of energy, we don't understand where our civilization came from.

731
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:28,400
And how does your view and that of Bob Ayers and Reiner Kuml and other what we might call

732
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:35,040
biophysical economists or in your case post-Kinsey economists, how does your current

733
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:41,600
understanding of energy and the production function differ from the biophysical economists

734
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:51,360
that started to gain traction in the 1970s? You know, Howard O'odham and George Eskewer-Roligan

735
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:56,400
and Charlie Hall and such. Is it nuance? Is it different?

736
01:15:56,720 --> 01:15:59,840
It is just basically finding a better way to put it together. I mean, for example,

737
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:04,240
Bob, of course, was in the house when I made that discovery with the listang in his flat.

738
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:11,360
And it took me 10 minutes or less to work out the mathematics. It's ridiculously simple.

739
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:15,200
But he then just said that that solves it. That rings in the role of energy.

740
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:22,640
So because he and O'Kuml had ever thought making energy and input into the labor and

741
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:27,520
capital, they had energy as a third factor. And once you've just said it's got to be an input,

742
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:32,960
it all falls apart, falls together, pardon me. I totally agree with that. But here's what I

743
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:40,240
don't understand. If we don't have energy, all technologies are sculptures. And I added to

744
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:48,400
your statement and said cities are museums. But we do have energy. And we're probably going to have

745
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:54,960
less energy in the future. But how we use that energy, how we combine that energy with materials

746
01:16:54,960 --> 01:17:03,520
and human imagination and creativity, that does add something to just the raw value of the energy.

747
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:14,960
So it's the combination of machines, raw materials like copper and silicon and

748
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:25,280
phosphorus, you know, neodymium and water and phosphorus, and the fire, some electrons or flame,

749
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:32,000
either kinetic or potential energy. And that comes up with a product that humans value.

750
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:41,360
And so how do you distinguish the contribution of actually the flame or the electrons versus

751
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:47,200
the machine and the new invention? I'm actually going to go right back to 1774

752
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,000
and give you an explanation for that. And I quote this in my new book, because I think

753
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:57,600
Turgo wrote one of the most brilliant paragraphs in the history of economics. And I just wish this

754
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,720
had been where economics came from rather than 1776, two years later, with Adam Smith. So pardon

755
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:07,440
me, reading out a substantial slapper and looking above the camera to do it. The husband and the

756
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:13,600
mistakes are seen as just being with agriculture as any production system, including manufacturing,

757
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:17,760
obviously. The husband and the man is the only person whose labor produces something over and

758
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:22,640
above the wages of labor. He is therefore the sole source of all wealth. The land pays him

759
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,960
directly the price of his labor, independently of any other man or agreement. Nature does not

760
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,440
bargain with him to oblige him to content himself with what is absolutely necessary,

761
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:36,400
what she grants his proportional neither to his wants nor would have contractual valuation of

762
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:40,800
the price of his days of labor. And this is one of the punchlines. It is the physical result of

763
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:46,560
the fertility of the soil and of the wisdom, far more than of the laboriousness of the means with

764
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:51,120
which he is employed to render it fertile. So that's the role of humans in involving

765
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:58,640
concepts, changing how we bring out the energy. As soon as the labor that the husband produces

766
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,920
more than his wants, he can with this superfluity that nature records him as a pure gift over and

767
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:09,280
above the wages of his toil. There's energy return and energy invested by the labors of the

768
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,520
other members of society. This latter and selling to him gain only their livelihood,

769
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:19,200
but the husband and gathers beyond his subsistence a wealth which is independent and disposable,

770
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:25,360
which he has not bought and which he sells. Now all the ideas we're talking about are tied

771
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:33,680
up in that one paragraph. Earlier you said you had a quote that you start with a seed and

772
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:40,560
you plant it and nature gives you back 1,000 seeds. But what if the husband was really clever

773
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:48,000
and found out a way to plant a seed and get back 2,000 seeds? The gift would still be from nature,

774
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,760
but it was doubled because of his creativity and intelligence.

775
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:55,280
And that's the line in the middle. It is the physical result of the fertility of the soil

776
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:01,120
and of the wisdom, far more so than the laboriousness. So in the terms of wisdom,

777
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:07,840
what he's saying is we devise new ways of doing different things and that wisdom is far more

778
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:13,520
important than the effort we put in physically to do it. So again our ideas play an essential role

779
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:19,440
and we wouldn't be able to exploit this free energy without our minds that can devise new ways

780
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:27,760
of harnessing the energy far more rapidly and far more effectively. So the wisdom is definitely in

781
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:34,480
there and the wisdom itself turns up in the machines. So it is embodied in the machines. So

782
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:42,240
all this stuff, right back in 774, that paragraph has far more wisdom than the whole world of nations.

783
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:50,480
So this is all kind of testable although we're on a roller coaster ride. So I think there's a

784
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:57,440
possibility and I know this is a totally separate conversation that we could lose

785
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:04,880
20% of our energy in coming decades for various reasons or more or more. But let's just say 20%.

786
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:13,680
So I would think that would cause a 20% or more drop in GDP. What would economists say?

787
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:21,760
They'd say, of course, 0.8% drop in GDP. 0.8. That's a strict timeless thing.

788
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,640
Do you think most economists actually believe that?

789
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,320
Yep, I do. I've worked with them for long enough to know they swallow this stuff.

790
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:35,600
So if you look at the data, like changing in GDP and changing in energy, that's figure 57 at the

791
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:41,600
moment in my book, it may change. But it's such a one-for-one relationship, it's ridiculous.

792
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:47,680
And yet they don't even look at it. And when Rudy and Berkman and friends made that comment

793
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:55,600
about the 0.10% fall in energy, 0.4% fall in GDP,

794
01:21:56,240 --> 01:22:00,320
obviously they didn't look at the data. And they ridiculed Leontia when Leontia actually

795
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,080
reproduces the data. That would be like the opposite of a Nobel Prize. We should develop

796
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:10,320
something like that. Well, the Nobel Prize isn't the opposite of a Nobel Prize. Do you

797
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,640
know why? No, I don't. Okay, so there's that.

798
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:19,440
In economics, yeah. The synergy. All right, big, big picture. Let's move to the stratosphere here.

799
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:25,840
What are the implications of everything that you've said for our modern society and for our future

800
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,600
and for our decisions and planning for that moment?

801
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:37,600
The fundamental grounding is that without energy, there is no GDP. And we have been getting our

802
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,400
energy out of fossil fuel forms. And of course, with fossil fuels, we generate carbon dioxide

803
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:46,880
that is causing global warming. And that is destabilizing the climate on which our production

804
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:53,200
systems depend. And we've been blind of that, particularly the economists who so-called specialists

805
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,360
in climate change, William Nordhaus and friends, have no idea of this either.

806
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:03,760
So that's another flaw in the production function is there's not the waste capacity that feeds back

807
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:09,360
in to the biosphere that is our only source of wealth. Because without oxygen and

808
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,600
viable ecosystems, we all die.

809
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:15,760
Yeah. Now, that's not concluded in the way the neoclassicals think about climate change.

810
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,240
And that's why we've got nonsense statements like by Nordhaus, for example, saying that

811
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:24,800
it's really, really difficult to find any direct impacts of the expected climate change

812
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:29,760
on the bulk of the economy in the next 50 to 75 years. Now, by the bulk of the economy,

813
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:36,000
all of manufacturing, even included all of mining, services, industries, government, etc., etc.,

814
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:41,600
could see no way in which climate change will affect that. Well, if we have energy, if we get

815
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:46,560
like a blanket ban on using fossil fuels because of totally destructive change to the climate

816
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,040
in the next five years or so, or 10 years, there'll be an incredible plunge in GDP.

817
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:52,400
And we're not prepared for it at all.

818
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:58,640
And I think if James Hansen and his colleagues are right, we're going to have a spike in

819
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:09,200
climate warming temperatures in 2024 because we're shifting from the PDO from La Niña to El Niño

820
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:16,800
on the backs of the sulfur aerosols being reduced as a masking of the thermal inertia.

821
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:24,160
So, we're going to see. And if we go up a half a degree Celsius next year, as they're suggesting,

822
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:28,720
that's going to have massive impacts around the world. And then, yes, you're right, people are

823
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:36,000
going to be like, oh my God, this is like real and our emissions are rising and fossil energy is to

824
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,880
blame. But I think most people still don't understand the deep linkage between fossil

825
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:47,760
energy and the size and scope of our economy because they're energy blind.

826
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,680
Yeah, and economists have contributed to this blindness rather than

827
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:58,320
clarifying that it's absolutely essential. And on your previous podcast here, this is your third

828
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:05,840
appearance on this show, you predicted that economists, because of their identities and

829
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:13,520
status and built personal situation, they will not change until there's a crisis.

830
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:20,720
So, can we anticipate what's going to happen with the environment with

831
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:28,480
oil depletion, though that's going to happen gradually, with what's coming and create some

832
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:34,320
blueprints and break grass and case of emergency plans that are actually based on

833
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:39,760
what a physiocrat might advise the French king, the modern equivalent of that?

834
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,440
Can we do that?

835
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:46,880
I think it's incredibly late timing to be doing that. But as you know, we've depended on

836
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:52,720
fossil fuels for about 85% of our energy. And that hasn't changed much in the last 20 years.

837
01:25:52,720 --> 01:25:57,520
It's gone down to some extent for some time because of growth in fossil fuel production

838
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:03,600
decline in hydroelectric, which is the main form. That's the main form of renewables,

839
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:11,760
even now as hydroelectric, it's not wind and solar. So, we're going to see

840
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:17,440
quite serious climate catastrophes coming our way. The ones with most of the climate

841
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:22,800
scientists I'm in touch with are scared about are global famine caused by a collapse in

842
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:28,240
food output from one of the wheat belts or corn belts of the world. And that then leading to

843
01:26:28,240 --> 01:26:33,440
social breakdown because suddenly we haven't got the food we need. Or, you know, wet bold

844
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:38,880
catastrophes, the other one, which would hit third world countries more than it would hit

845
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:44,320
westerns probably. But something which is catastrophic, which causes a massive collapse

846
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:50,800
in population and then leads to probably rogue behavior by governments around the world then

847
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:55,920
because we haven't managed to even reach an agreement to phase our fossil fuels

848
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:03,360
at the last cop-out meeting. It'll be every country for itself in what could be a very chaotic

849
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:08,160
environment, will be a very chaotic environment if we see something like a global famine.

850
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,400
So, you're saying that we shouldn't look to the neoclassical economists who are the

851
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:22,000
current economic shaman and cheerleaders of our cultural narrative of the early 21st century.

852
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:26,640
We shouldn't look to them to change their minds and chart a different course.

853
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:30,560
They will be the most shocked and most confused while it happens completely. They're useless.

854
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:36,480
They've led us astray. It's just been a cascade of errors right back to Smith as I've said that

855
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:40,880
led us to the situation. But the last people have any understanding of the physical role of

856
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:45,440
production on the planet are economists. And the last ones who realize the dangers of climate

857
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:50,320
change are also economists. So, I would just like kick them out of the room. They don't belong here.

858
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:55,600
I tend to agree, but let me play devil's advocate. There are a lot of bright,

859
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:02,080
pro-future young people in college, in graduate school, in postgraduate. Couldn't some of them

860
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:11,280
take the kernels of truth bombs that you've been laying out here and contribute to the science

861
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:19,760
and understanding and translate between what you're saying and what the traditional neoclassical

862
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,240
economics departments around the world? I suspect your answer is going to be no, because

863
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:29,680
their boss and the people that gets the funding are the tenured economists and they're not going

864
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:36,880
to fund this sort of research. Or what do you think? It's a waste of time. I mean, some of the

865
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:41,680
young ones are worth reaching to say, look, if the cards say join rethinking economics,

866
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,640
fight against your curriculum. But fundamentally, if you want people to give you a guidance right

867
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:53,600
now, it's going to be the engineers. And they're the ones we should be. Get the engineers to look

868
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:59,360
at it. The first thing an engineer is going to look at is the energy supply. That's the nature

869
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:04,800
of training of engineers. It's all about how you use energy and how you direct it to produce useful

870
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,040
outcomes rather than blowing things up. So, the engineers are the ones we need to rely upon,

871
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:15,120
and we should have been getting them to build the alternative technologies in the last 40 or 50 years

872
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:19,840
rather than me getting a lot of them to go off and work out as financial engineers instead and

873
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:26,000
give us speculative bubbles in real estate and shares. So, we have had a huge misdirection of

874
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:30,960
our intelligence for the last 40 or 50 years. And again, economists, it'll blame for that.

875
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,000
When does your book come out and what's it called?

876
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:38,480
Hopefully it'll be coming out. It depends upon the publisher's process, of course,

877
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:44,400
but hopefully by March, I would say. And the title is going to be the rebuilding economics

878
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:52,800
from the top down. Well, I've read the energy chapter and it is quite compelling. Steve, you

879
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:58,960
and I talk about what's going on now in the world, but I didn't know a lot of the things that you

880
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:04,560
have dug up by reading these original papers. You also told me that most people in economics

881
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:08,560
don't even read these original papers. No, they never go back and read the original.

882
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:16,320
Yeah, originals is just terrible. Yeah. So, this was a little bit of a Sherlock Holmes treatment

883
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:24,960
of the history of the production function and the complete absence of energy in describing

884
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:31,360
our wealth and productivity. And yet, energy is embedded in everything including the labor

885
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:37,280
and capital functions. Do you have any closing words for listeners who might be a little shell

886
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:45,200
shocked by this conversation? The main thing comes down to how economists, by not understanding

887
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:51,120
energy, have trivialized the dangers of climate change. So, we are likely to see that striking

888
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:58,000
this decade. I mean, we both know the potential 0.5 degree increase in global temperatures out of

889
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:07,120
the both El Nino plus the hypothetical role of losing, leaving the sulfur emissions as

890
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:12,080
we've been masking some increase in global temperatures. That should cause absolutely

891
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:18,160
chaotic weather, probably starting in the next northern summer. So, it's going to be brutally

892
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:23,120
certain that this starts happening and we have to prepare as soon as possible that all the XR

893
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:32,000
activists dial it up. Engineers start realizing we have to, as soon as possible,

894
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,640
start producing whatever alternatives we can work out to reduce the amount of carbon we're

895
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:42,080
putting into the atmosphere as soon as possible. That's the most important thing to have some

896
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:47,600
potential to hang onto human civilization over the next two decades. If we don't do it, it's back

897
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:53,360
to the starting edge. Thank you, Steve, as always, to be continued, my friend, and good luck with
