1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Unfortunately, the dynamic of positive feedback and super linear skating leads to the speeding

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,320
up with the pace of life. So you have to do things faster and faster, and that eventually

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,560
leads to a socioeconomic heart attack. And that's the issue. And so how do you get around that?

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,920
I am pleased and honored to welcome my next guest, the physicist Jeffrey West to the program.

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,840
Jeffrey was a professor at Stanford. He was the leader and founder of a high-energy physics

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,400
group at Los Alamos. And most recently, he was the president of the Santa Fe Institute. He has been

7
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:51,200
long fascinated with general scaling phenomenon in biology and nature. Today, we talk, among other

8
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:59,200
things, about Kleiber's law, which states that the metabolism or the energy use of an organism

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,200
scales to the three-quarter power of its size. And we apply that not only to human bodies,

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,080
but to human exosomatic energy, how much we use in cities and the whole world with fascinating

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,000
ominous implications. For those of you that have long followed this podcast, this conversation

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,960
is a must-watch and also enjoyable. Jeffrey is kind of like a wise kind of physicist version of

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:40,720
Gandolf. And I learned a lot. I think this is at the core of what people need to understand

14
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,760
about the linkage between human nurture and human nature as biological organisms,

15
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:53,280
how we use energy and materials. Hope you enjoy it. Please welcome Jeffrey West.

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,560
Jeffrey West, welcome to the program.

17
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,280
Nate, thank you so much for having me. I'm delighted to be on your podcast.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,640
You are an important human to have on this podcast because the great simplification at its core

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:29,680
is about the metabolism of cities, economies, our culture. And you are probably the most world-renowned

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:37,120
scientist on the concept of metabolism and scale. So I really wanted to get you on,

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,800
and I'm glad we finally connected. Yes. As I said, I'm delighted to be on,

22
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,400
and I'm sorry we couldn't do it sooner. So I, of course, have like 20 questions

23
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,240
just for starters. But if you could, in your lifetime of work at the Santa Fe Institute

24
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:04,640
and elsewhere, you have a very wide biology systems approach to the world. If we could start

25
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,400
with just a flash round of explaining some key concepts in not too lengthy answers,

26
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,720
just as a foundation that apply to the theme of this podcast. So let's start with the basics.

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:26,560
What is Kleiber's law? So Kleiber's law is, first of all, is named after a man named Max Kleiber,

28
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:37,200
who was a biologist, what is now UC Davis in California. And he discovered, I guess is the

29
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:48,160
right word, a remarkable systematic law in biology for what is presumably the most fundamental

30
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:54,880
quantity of interest, not just for an organism, but almost for any system. That is, how much

31
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:01,760
energy does it need to sustain itself and indeed to do the activities to function.

32
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,760
And that's called, of course, in biology, that's called metabolic rate. Roughly speaking,

33
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,520
it's equivalent to how much food you need each day to stay alive. And what Kleiber did was he

34
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:25,120
both gathered past evidence and did some measurements himself of metabolic rate

35
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:36,400
for a whole spectrum of animals, mostly sort of from mice to elephants. And what he discovered

36
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:44,000
was that there was a very systematic and mathematically extremely simple scaling law

37
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,800
for how that quantity scaled from the, well, in this case, the smallest mammal to the largest

38
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
mammal that he could measure at the time, although he did also have some measurements

39
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,760
someone else had taken on whales, blue whales. But what he discovered that was so important

40
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,800
was the following. So first of all, you have to recognize to plot a mouse and an elephant on the

41
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:20,240
same graph is a challenge of itself because an elephant is maybe 100,000 times heavier than a mouse.

42
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:29,920
And so instead of plotting it 1234 in terms of grams, the natural way to plot it is by factors of 10.

43
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:39,200
One, 10, 100,000, etc. In which case on ordinary sheet of paper, you can get both a mouse and

44
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:44,320
an elephant. And when he did that, and that's called plotting it logarithmically, when he did that,

45
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,560
he found something extraordinary. The points lie almost precisely on a straight line,

46
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:01,840
which is kind of amazing because each one of these organisms has evolved by natural selection.

47
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:08,160
So by which we mean that it's gone through this sort of, roughly speaking, arbitrary and chaotic

48
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,360
process in competition with every other organism in the biosphere, so to speak. And so it's

49
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:21,360
historically contingent. That's how we think of organisms as historically contingent,

50
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,400
meaning that if you plotted it the way I just described, you would expect, okay,

51
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,040
there might be some correlations, but they would sort of be spread all over the graph,

52
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:39,600
each point reflecting, so to speak, the historical trajectory of the organism. Quite the contrary,

53
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,240
they all line up beautifully on a straight line. And what in addition that he discovered was that

54
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:53,760
the slope of that line was very close to the number three quarters, 0.75. And that became known

55
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:02,240
as Kleiber's law for metabolic rates. So if it was so robust across all these organisms

56
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,520
of historical contingency, the implication is it functions akin to a natural law,

57
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,160
something going on on our planet and with species alive here.

58
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,440
Yeah, so one of the things that you've implied by that is that what Kleiber did was, of course,

59
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,400
for some subset of organisms, almost entirely mammals, but later he and others expanded it

60
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:36,160
across the entire sort of spectrum of organisms from cells all the way up to ecosystems. And

61
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,440
they discovered this law is indeed incredibly robust. It applies to any taxonomic group of

62
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:52,320
organisms, whether fish, birds, mammals, cells and so forth. And so therefore, it's sort of natural

63
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,960
to conclude that this is in that sense, a law of nature. It may not be a law of nature, sort of

64
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,960
like Newton's laws with governing motions and so on, in the sense that they're precise. Because if

65
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,080
you look at the graph, each point lies just, you know, slightly off from that straight line a little

66
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,360
bit. But in that statistical sense, it's an extraordinarily robust law that metabolic rate

67
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:24,000
scales the language of it as the three quarters power of mass across the biosphere.

68
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,840
So as you survey an animal and their size gets bigger, the amount of energy they need to sustain

69
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:39,440
themselves per day scales according to their mass, but not one for one, but to the three quarters power.

70
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,560
Indeed. And what is the scientific speculation on why it's three quarters power?

71
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,880
Yeah. So first of all, let me just say a word about that three quarters. That three quarters

72
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,120
obviously less than one. So we call that sublinear. And three quarters less than one means that,

73
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,760
you know, if it were one, the slope of one, that would be linear, which means if you

74
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,000
double the size, you would double the number. So you would double, you'd need twice as much food.

75
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,640
So this law has this extraordinary consequence that every time you double, you actually save 25%.

76
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,680
So there's this systematic economy of scale that goes from the smallest to the largest.

77
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,160
And that has profound consequences for the whole structure of the biosphere,

78
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,640
including the sustainability of the biosphere, which maybe we can come to later.

79
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,360
But going to your question, namely, you know, what is the origin of it? That's what got me into the

80
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,000
game because I learned about this scaling law many years ago. And for various reasons started

81
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,240
getting very intrigued by it, especially because it's so antithetical to one's sort of naive idea

82
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,160
of what evolution by natural selection is going to produce, all this sort of randomness and

83
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,760
sort of arbitrariness. And quite the contrary, as I said earlier, this is very highly systematic

84
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,440
and predictable. And that got me involved in trying to understand it, especially because

85
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,960
I learned that there wasn't any generic sort of universal explanation. And I got involved in it.

86
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:28,880
And I came up with this idea, the following, that if you ask what is common to not just birds,

87
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:37,440
birds, fish, mammals, and so forth, but also plants, plants also satisfy the same law,

88
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,320
which are quite different. What is similar about, well, the thing that's similar is that

89
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,200
they have this huge challenge of having a huge number of component cells. We have about 100

90
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:58,880
trillion inside us, and they have to be sustained, fed in a sort of roughly speaking egalitarian and

91
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:05,040
efficient way. And the way we've done it, we, meaning natural selection, have done it, is evolve

92
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,640
these networks that serve as cells, either like a circulatory system, respiratory systems, and so

93
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:21,680
on. And the idea was that I worked on was the idea was that this is universal, and that it is the

94
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:31,120
mathematics and physics of these distribution networks of energy, resources, oxygen to the cells

95
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,880
that is constraining metabolic rate to have this simple scaling law. And if I could understand it

96
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:45,360
and do the mathematics properly, I would be able to derive the number three quarters

97
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:54,720
from the properties of the networks. So between a mouse and an elephant is a human. So the human

98
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:03,760
would be our internal body with 100 trillion cells would lie in that logarithmic chart between a mouse

99
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,040
and an elephant. But what about outside of the body, our transportation networks in our cities,

100
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:20,720
in our global economy? How does that apply? Because that isn't an animal. That is a social

101
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:29,520
and economic structure built by animals. So, yes, so let me just give us a little, a few words

102
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:38,240
about the background to this. So this theory was developed based on networks, just thinking about

103
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:46,480
organisms to begin with. It was actually extended to forests, which is a community of organisms.

104
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,320
And does it apply to forests as well? Yes, it applies to forests. That's what's amazing, actually.

105
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:00,560
It applies to trees, plants. And when you put those all together to form a community,

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,080
it applies to them. So it was very natural when we extended it to all these things we found,

107
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,360
you know, it was sort of almost a complete theory of the scaling of almost any

108
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:24,400
physiological attribute or trait of an organism, and to any of its life history events, like, you

109
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:30,480
know, how long you live, how long you take to mature and so on. But then when all that work was done,

110
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,520
brewing in the background was your question. Human beings are special. We've done something

111
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,560
extraordinary, including what we're doing here. We've created this incredible technology. We,

112
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:52,080
once we discovered language, which this technology doesn't seem to the viewers, but we are using

113
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,400
quite a bit of energy right now with the light and the internet connection and the

114
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,160
embedded energy and all the microphones and everything. Absolutely. And so it was natural

115
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:09,440
to ask the question, you know, what about the what, you know, the socioeconomic activity

116
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,160
that we have created, which for one of a better word, I like to now use anthroposphere,

117
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,240
or sometimes I like the word a bannosphere, because one of the things that has become very

118
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,040
apparent in this last century is the planet is dominated by cities, which is our very

119
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:37,360
manifestation of our evolution from hunter-gatherers to becoming sedentary communities, and then

120
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,320
forming these massive cities and all the fantastic things and also the bad things that come along with

121
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,800
urban living. So going to your very question about how does that change metabolic rate?

122
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,200
And this is a fundamental question. First of all, you have to ask the question

123
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:04,640
about just organisms in their natural state. In their natural state, what I talked about,

124
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,560
metabolic rate scaling with the three quarters power, you have to ask yourself, first of all,

125
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:16,000
what is the what is our metabolic rate? How big is it? First of all, what we call our basal

126
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,600
metabolic rate, which is simply the amount of energy you use. So sitting around doing nothing,

127
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:31,200
doing that number is 100 watts. That is two, but most people don't realize that's 2000 food calories

128
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:39,360
a day, which is how much food you need to eat to stay alive, is only 100 watts. You only operate

129
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,440
the energy of a light bulb, which is truly extraordinary. Now, if you add in your hunting

130
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,120
and gathering, so to speak, I mean, before we became this marvelous socioeconomic entity,

131
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,120
it goes up by a factor of two or three. And that's true across all mammals. That's true of a mouse,

132
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,480
it's true of an elephant. If you include their actual activity, it's two or three hundred, two

133
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,280
to three times bigger. So our sort of natural active metabolic rate, and there's still people on the

134
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:18,480
planet that live this way, is somewhere between 200 and 300 watts. So anyway, so now you ask about us

135
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:28,240
participating as we are here, as you said, using energy to fuel this communication system, to have

136
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,200
the energy that was used to make the laptop that sits in front of me, to have this office,

137
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:39,200
this nice office I'm in, to produce all those books behind me, to have an automobile out in

138
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,280
the parking lot that I'm going to go home, I have a home, I have all this stuff that's part of me.

139
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,040
We think of it as, it's actually me and it's you. It's your exosomatic metabolism. Exactly,

140
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:00,400
exactly. And if you add all that up and you ask how big is it, it's not a hundred watts,

141
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,520
it's not even two or three hundred watts. If you're an American, it's about 11,000 watts.

142
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:15,200
Our social metabolic rate is about a hundred times what our natural basal metabolic rate is.

143
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,200
So on on Kleiber scale, 11,000 watts would scale to what size of an animal?

144
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:30,480
It's about 30, what is it? It's equivalent to about a dozen elephants. That's the number I

145
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,720
usually keep in mind. It's about the blue whale is the biggest mammal, the biggest organism that's

146
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,000
ever existed. It's not quite a blue whale. We're maybe a half to three quarters somewhere in there,

147
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,440
the size of a blue whale. So each of us on the planet roughly, or each of us certainly in the

148
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,800
United States and developed countries are acting as if we were the size of almost a blue whale.

149
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,960
Or 10 to 12 elephants. Certainly about a dozen elephants.

150
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,880
So that's the U.S., which is about four or five times the global average, right?

151
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,720
No, it's not even four or five times. It's more like about two to three, actually,

152
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,960
believe it or not. It's kind of amazing, actually. It's not as big as people think.

153
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,600
And it depends a little bit, you know, I mean, getting measurements of social

154
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,160
metabolic rate is actually quite a challenge to know exactly what you put in there and what you

155
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,720
don't. You do include the military, you know, questions like that. Exactly. So there's all

156
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,880
kinds of question mark, but nevertheless, you know, there and this is work, you know, that now

157
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:48,720
I'm beginning to push very hard on that we need seriously to come to terms with what we mean by

158
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,400
that and what that number is and get it for different countries, different cultures and so

159
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:02,240
forth. Let me ask you this. So you've been a lifetime scientist and systems analyst. At some

160
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,720
point in the last 20 or 30 years, you were working at a computer or a notebook and you

161
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:16,640
discovered that the metabolism of the average American was a dozen elephants. Did you at that

162
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,720
moment like, was that like disgusting and profound? Like, oh my God, like, was that a shock to you?

163
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,360
Yes, I think it was at the time because I really was, you know, this was near the beginning of the

164
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,520
work and I hadn't sort of put it all together and I hadn't seen its extent. And most importantly, I

165
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:45,440
hadn't seen its consequences. And this was one way that sort of made me sit up when I realized,

166
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,400
when I turned the equation around, that is, given if I take seriously that metabolic rate

167
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:01,120
of 11,000 and ask that question, how big an animal are we actually equivalent to? And seeing

168
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,080
how big it is, that already blew my mind. And then beginning to realize that, well, at that time,

169
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,720
there were, you know, 7.2 billion people on the planet. And each one of us in our own way wants to be

170
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,560
having a social metabolic rate of over 10,000 watts. And that is extraordinary. And that brought

171
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,200
to home to me the challenge that we have in sustaining, you know, what is brought to us

172
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:37,200
so far to this stage. So not only are we functioning metabolically as a dozen elephants,

173
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,960
but that is our global cultural goal is to get to that point or beyond that point.

174
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:50,240
Yeah, no, I think that's right. I think that's, you know, and, of course, it's even more so,

175
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:58,800
it's, you know, those of us, the leading edge of this, namely in Western Europe and the United

176
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:04,960
States are pushing to get more, actually. I mean, that's what the economy, you know, that's the

177
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,560
paradigm that we're in. You know, it's been most successful, it's been an extraordinarily successful

178
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:17,760
paradigm, you know, the discovery and exploitation of fossil fuels coupled with the discovery and

179
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,080
exploitation of capitalism and entrepreneurship and, you know, the extraordinary creation of wealth.

180
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:33,280
It's been phenomenal. I understand the natural law aspect of Kleiber's law as it pertains to mice

181
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:41,840
and individual humans and elephants and forests and the like. But if a human system like a city

182
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:51,680
or an economy, the social metabolism got bigger, does Kleiber's law automatically apply to that?

183
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:57,760
Or is there, on the social metabolism, is there less of a natural law and more of maybe a nature

184
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:06,000
versus nurture wide boundary of possibilities? Yeah, this is a really important question and

185
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,520
not one that's easy to answer. First of all, what you call Kleiber's law strictly only applies to

186
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,320
organisms. That's this three quarters. When you look at analogs to social metabolic rate,

187
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:29,440
they could be proxies like, you know, GDP, GDP of a city could be GDP of the planet, but GDP of a

188
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:39,040
city or, you know, the wages in a city or the number of patents it produces in a city, how

189
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:46,160
much innovation is produced, all these are sort of proxies for or results of social metabolism.

190
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:55,040
What we discovered was that instead of the three quarters, we see a number like 1.15,

191
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,760
and which is instead of being less than one, which meant sublinear was the word I use, which meant

192
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:11,280
the bigger you are, the less you need per capita, in that case, per cell for an organism.

193
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,840
When you come to a city, you're exactly the opposite. The bigger you are, the more you need

194
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:23,680
per capita, in that case, per human being. There's a metabolic positive feedback. Exactly.

195
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,960
As a positive feedback, and that positive feedback can be traced back to the positive feedback

196
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,920
for the dynamic and the process of what cities were evolved to be, namely to facilitate and

197
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:46,320
encourage social interaction. And so that positive feedback is a result of the positive feedback

198
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:53,040
in social interaction that comes from me talking to you until you talk about this thing that we

199
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,160
build on each other. So it's creating new nodes and each node requires more energy.

200
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,720
It creates new nodes and it creates new ideas. We're continually creating ideas and creating

201
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,560
wealth. And that, as I say, has been enormously successful, and that leads to this super linear

202
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:18,080
scaling. And what about villages or people living in the countryside? Are those smaller

203
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,520
entities with 10 houses or 100 houses different than a big city like Santa Fe or New York?

204
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:31,920
Well, Santa Fe is a small city. It's bigger than a few houses. It's bigger than a small village,

205
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:39,920
that's for sure. Well, the thing is that what is amazing is that the data shows that this dynamic

206
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:48,000
systematically increases with size of the city. Because it increases the chance of more interactions

207
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:55,360
and great cities encourage more interaction. I mean, New York is maybe the prime example of a

208
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,560
place where the buzz of the city is visceral and really encourages, not only that, it encourages

209
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:11,120
not just interactions, but it encourages potential and possibility. And that tends to be absent

210
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,720
as you go down in size. This may have to be a three-part podcast because now you're getting

211
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,200
into some deep areas that I've speculated a long time. Let me first ask you,

212
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:30,240
do you have an opinion on what Howard Odom called the fourth law of thermodynamics, which is the

213
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:37,040
maximum power principle? Which maybe that's related to Kleiber's law, that organisms and ecosystems

214
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:44,320
self-organize to take advantage or to degrade an energy gradient. Do you believe that?

215
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:49,760
Well, in some form of it, I do believe. Yes. And in fact, all the work that I do

216
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,400
is based on something that's slightly more general than that, in fact. And that is, all of these

217
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,120
systems evolve towards optimizing something. We're called it something. So for example,

218
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:10,960
just to give you, just to go back to take it out of the socioeconomic characteristics to talk about

219
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,960
organisms again. So the way the derivation and calculation of Kleiber's law follows

220
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:27,680
from the network theory is that all mammals that have ever existed share the same kind of

221
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,000
cardiovascular system that has evolved to minimize the amount of work your heart has to do

222
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:42,640
in order to pump blood through the system to supply energy to the cells, energy and oxygen

223
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:51,360
to the cells to sustain life. And the idea is that you minimize that in order to gain a

224
00:26:52,160 --> 00:27:00,320
fitness advantage by being able to devote more energy in the case of organisms to sex and

225
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,960
reproduction and the rearing of offspring, which is Darwinian fitness to project into the future

226
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:16,320
your genes. And so there's a kind of, so you optimize the structure of the network in order to

227
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:25,360
minimize the amount of energy. And so this is one of a number of these kinds of optimization

228
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:33,920
principles of which Odoms is another one. And cities, you could argue, have evolved to do two

229
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:42,960
things because they are much more sophisticated in some ways than an organism because they have

230
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,720
two pieces. They have infrastructure, which is the analog to your circulatory and respiratory

231
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,560
system and all the rest. But they also have something that we've just touched on, and that is

232
00:27:54,560 --> 00:28:00,640
social networks, that feedback, positive feedback. And the city is sort of the integration and

233
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,760
tension between those two. And so in the social, in that, well, let's talk the infrastructure

234
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:13,120
network, you might hypothesize that the thing that's being optimized is, or as cities evolve,

235
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:20,960
was that the transport system, whatever it was, even if it's just walking, was such that the

236
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:27,040
structure of the city evolves so that you minimize the time in order to get from A to B, wherever

237
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:32,560
A and B are, you minimize the time and the distance. And that's what you try to do when you,

238
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,360
you know, when you go home, you don't take some arbitrary route, you try to, you know, a route

239
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:46,240
that is optimal in terms of your time and distance and so forth. The social network, on the other hand,

240
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,880
might optimize in order to simply to create interaction, the way the system is to facilitate

241
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,920
more and more interactions, so that more ideas can come to the surface, more wealth can be produced,

242
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,320
and so on. So here's why I brought up maximum power principle. Yeah, so it's very similar to that.

243
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:17,760
So if we had a city of a thousand elephants, that city would largely have the same metabolism

244
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:25,680
of the individual elephants times a thousand. Exactly. But if we have humans, there are social

245
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:35,040
status pressures, there's moving upward in the social hierarchy, there's novelty, there's discovery,

246
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:43,440
there's incentive, and so I would argue that that dopamine, in a way, is part of the origin

247
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,760
when humans are living in proximity like that in large numbers, that might explain some of your

248
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:59,200
1.15 positive extra linear dynamic, which is almost a brain equivalent of the maximum power

249
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,760
principle. There's something that we're trying to optimize that's outside our basal metabolism.

250
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,360
It's something social, which is why there's a positive feedback there. Yeah, absolutely. No,

251
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,760
it's exactly right. And by the way, just going back to the biological for a moment,

252
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,400
I said you only require about 100 watts, 2000 food calories a day. But if you took all your cells,

253
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:29,920
all that 10 to the 12th, 100 trillion of them, and just put them aside and asked,

254
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,360
how much energy does all those cells, if they were not interacting and be part of you,

255
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:43,200
just laid them out on a table, if you could imagine it, you would require 50 times as much food.

256
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:52,560
So you have an extraordinary economy of scale in bringing all this together in all of us,

257
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,960
in your whole body, interacting in a highly coherent, integrated way. And so it is with the

258
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:09,280
city. And I'll give you an example. I think what is in New York is about

259
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:22,320
100 times bigger than Santa Fe in population, turns out, roughly. And New York produces,

260
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,680
so you might have a naively guess, New York will produce 100 times more patents.

261
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:36,240
It doesn't. It produces 200 times as many than Santa Fe. And you could ask, how many patents,

262
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,440
if we took all of the individuals in Santa Fe or New York, and you made them into some guru that

263
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,880
sits on the top of a mountain and contemplates the mysteries of the universe, how many patents

264
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,000
would that produce if you took all 15 million New Yorkers and put them on the top of the mountain

265
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,320
and so on. You know how many patents they produce? Zero.

266
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,280
Well, because they no longer care about social status, they want to reflect.

267
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,800
Exactly. So that's all part of what a city is. But without passing judgment, good or bad on it,

268
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,000
that's who we are.

269
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,800
Okay. So if you don't mind, I'm going to read out loud to you one of my favorite quotes that

270
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:26,800
was in my academic paper on the superorganism, and I'd like your opinion on it because I have

271
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,760
a deep philosophical question for you, and you're one of the first people that I've had live to

272
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,720
be able to answer it. So this is a quote from a book called A Short History of Progress by

273
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,280
Ronald Wright. What took place in the early 1500s was truly exceptional, something that had never

274
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:52,160
happened before and never will again. Two cultural experiments running in isolation for 15,000 years

275
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,240
or more at last came face to face. Amazingly, after all that time, each could recognize the

276
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:07,120
other's institution. When Cortez landed in Mexico, he found roads, canals, cities, palaces, schools,

277
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,800
law courts, markets, irrigation works, kings, priests, temples, peasants, artisans, armies,

278
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:19,920
astronomers, merchants, sports, theater, art, music, and books. High civilization, differing

279
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,160
in detail, but alike in essentials, had evolved independently on both sides of the earth. So

280
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:37,280
my question to you is, when humans encountered energy surplus, which was the unspent metabolism

281
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,040
outside the bodies in the form of agricultural surplus and eventually fossil hydrocarbons,

282
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:53,360
was this kind of inevitable, this scaling of cities like almost a cancer that is unfolding?

283
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:59,680
What are your thoughts? How can you explain that quote that I just said from your biological

284
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:09,920
systems background? Well, I guess I would have to say, to some degree, it was inevitable.

285
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:17,840
Namely, you might have even extended that because it was true of China. I mean,

286
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,160
when Marco Polo went to China, he discovered that he immediately recognized city, right? I mean,

287
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:30,320
and in fact, they'd existed way before the cities of Europe that he'd come from.

288
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,520
So, you know, we have, you know, there's only those three examples, and I'm a physicist,

289
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,000
a scientist, and one has to be careful about extrapolating from special cases or specifics.

290
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:54,320
Nevertheless, the theory that I have expounded of the origin of scaling, namely that it has its

291
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,680
origins in the networks that support these systems. On the one hand, let's just stay with

292
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,800
cities now for the moment. On the one hand, their infrastructural networks, the roads,

293
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:14,880
general transport lines, the supply lines, I mean, in modern cities, that would be electricity,

294
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,080
gas, water, and so on. But those are networks, and those are much like biological networks.

295
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,760
And on the other hand, the social networks that we just discussed,

296
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,480
the interaction between human beings, which is universal. I mean, we may look different,

297
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,480
and we have different cultures and different histories and geographies, but roughly speaking,

298
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,080
at the level of which we're having this conversation, human beings are pretty much

299
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:48,240
identical across the globe. Were you social? Absolutely. So that's who we are. It's in our

300
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,520
DNA, because we evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherers, forming sedentary communities,

301
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,960
discovering language and agriculture, and so forth, and leading eventually to

302
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:11,200
cities and megalopolises that we have now. So here's the thing, the evidence in favor of believing

303
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,720
that it was potentially inevitable. We discovered all these scaling laws for cities,

304
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,480
namely that and our stages with the superlinear for the moment. If you look at all socioeconomic

305
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:32,320
activities, whether the kinds of things I mentioned earlier, wages, number of patents produced,

306
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:39,440
amount of crime, amount of disease, et cetera, anything that involved the interaction of human

307
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,160
beings with each other, and you plot them versus city size, you see these beautiful scaling laws,

308
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,760
namely on a logarithmic plot, straight lines, and the slope is superlinear. It's about 1.15,

309
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,120
and it's the same for all these different metrics, but what is amazing and relevant to the question

310
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:05,200
you brought up, it's the same pretty much across the globe. That is, the scaling of cities within

311
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:14,000
the United States is the same as it is in Argentina, as it is in Spain, as it is in Portugal,

312
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:25,760
wherever. Therefore, it's as if, it's as if in, I don't know, 1800. People realize, my God, the

313
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,120
industrial revolution has come, this extraordinary expansion is going to be happening, we're building

314
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,400
cities like crazy, we need an international convention to bring together as to how we're

315
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,760
going to design cities, and these are the scaling laws that you have to obey, and go out there and

316
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,400
build your cities, but these are, well, of course none of that happened. It never happened. It never

317
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,040
happened, it happened totally organically, the Japanese cities which had nothing to do with

318
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:01,360
cities in Portugal, I presume, or very little, and cities in the United Kingdom all scaled in a

319
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:10,000
similar way, indicating that there was this organic dynamic that is already somehow in a DNA

320
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,720
which is being expressed in the organization and dynamic of city.

321
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:25,840
I sometimes in my public presentation show a graph of CO2 in the atmosphere from Montaloa

322
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:34,480
overlaid with all of the convening of parties, Kyoto Protocol, all the different meetings,

323
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,760
and you might say, oh, the CO2 is because of those meetings, but the CO2 increase is an

324
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,440
externality of the scaling that you're describing. Yes, absolutely. Oh, absolutely. In fact, I often

325
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:58,800
show a graph of the scaling of carbon emissions versus city size. So I really, I'm so honored to

326
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:06,320
have you because I really care about this, not only in what do we do about it, how can we steer

327
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,160
humanity to a better place, but it's just so fascinating. It's like a forensic detective

328
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:25,040
story, so it's cool despite the horror of the implications. So in theory, though, yes, humans

329
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:34,800
are you social, we have nature and nurture. Our bodies have this metabolic need, but our 10,000

330
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:44,640
watts outside of our 100 watt body, that is a social phenomenon. So is there a way that

331
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:54,000
governance or degrowth or something could come up with social structures that have a sublinear

332
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,360
metabolic scaling instead of a 1.15? Maybe we could reduce that in the future hypothetically.

333
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:08,320
What are your thoughts on that? Well, that's a tough question, one I quite a bit of thought to

334
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:15,600
without great success, to be honest. That is the implications of these scaling laws

335
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,920
for future growth and the future of the planet don't look good. I mean, in fact,

336
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,560
if you just take them to the logical conclusion, it's very hard to see how we can sustain things

337
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:37,520
as they are. So if we just simply continue in the same mode, I think we're due for some

338
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:45,760
major collapse at some stage. I hate to be so pessimistic, but it's hard to see how it can

339
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:53,840
sustain itself. It's sort of Malthusian in a way, but it's much more goes way beyond Malthus because

340
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,200
that statement includes the effects of innovation. I mean, the work that we've done,

341
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,160
you can put in an innovation plays a crucial role in it, in fact, but all it does in quotes all is,

342
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:17,520
yes, it postpones the problem till later, but unfortunately, the dynamic of positive feedback

343
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,720
and super linear scaling leads to the speeding up of the pace of life. So you have to do things

344
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:28,960
faster and faster, and that eventually leads to a socioeconomic heart attack, and that's the issue.

345
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,640
And so how do you get around that? Well, you have to change something fundamental,

346
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,920
and that's something to do with, if you believe any of this, it's to do with social networks and

347
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,760
social interaction, which means that it has to be almost revolutionary in the way we interact with

348
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:56,160
each other and form communities. And ultimately, that's not a scientific question, it's a political

349
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:00,800
question, it's a sociopolitical question. Or a spiritual question. Or a spiritual question,

350
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,000
yes, absolutely. Because if you took those, I don't know what the number you said, if you took

351
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,040
the 15 million people in New York that were developing patents and put them in the wilderness

352
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,920
somewhere, they would develop zero patents. But then when they came back to New York,

353
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,200
maybe they would have a change in consciousness, and there would also be less patents and less

354
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,600
social striving for competition, because maybe the definition of their self

355
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,880
expanded to include the biosphere and the future and other creatures.

356
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:44,640
Yeah, I think that's right. Because mostly, the baggage we have, that is us, is mostly material.

357
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:49,040
I mean, that's the way we think, you know, we identify ourselves with our jobs and our houses

358
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,280
and so on. And at best, in terms of human interaction, we identify with our loved ones and

359
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:03,360
people very close to us. But we don't identify very much with nature being part of us, even though

360
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:10,320
we're so obviously kind of came from the natural world, we are part of the natural world, but also

361
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:17,760
that we're all part of each other. I mean, it's, I know this sounds a bit flaky, but it's sort of

362
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,760
love thy neighbor as thyself kind of thing. And, you know, we are yearning in order to solve this

363
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:39,440
problem for, you know, some spark, some leadership that inspires us to rethink who we are and move

364
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:45,280
in a direction towards it. I mean, it's the image, I hate to say it, I'm not a religious person,

365
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:51,840
I'm not a Christian. But to have a Jesus Christ or a Mahatma Gandhi or a Martin Luther King,

366
00:43:51,840 --> 00:44:00,480
someone that inspires the good in people and the collective. And somehow we've lost that.

367
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,560
That's where my thinking has been going of late.

368
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:11,600
It's so weird. I mean, I'm, you know, I'm sufficiently old that I grew up in the city,

369
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:17,840
you know, my very formative years as an adult, with the 60s and 70s, and all the, you know,

370
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:23,680
flower children and love and all that, which is, you know, but I realized in my old age,

371
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,160
my science is sort of taking me back to realize that has sort of misguided as much of that was

372
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,600
the, you know, that, that sense of love and that sense of being part of the collective

373
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:44,480
and that it isn't just material well-being that is going to make you happy, that you need

374
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:51,840
also both, for one of a better word, spiritual, whatever that may mean to the individual,

375
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,880
but you need to be filled part of both the natural and social world.

376
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:03,680
I agree with that. And that's really the foundation and the ethos of, of this channel.

377
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:14,800
And, you know, here's a profound question in the same way that an addict can't solve his or her

378
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:24,320
addiction until he or she has awareness. Can we change our metabolism as a culture without,

379
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:30,560
without realizing that we have a metabolism? I think we have to recognize these metabolic

380
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,440
scaling laws that you've been working on because if we take that into account, it suggests some of

381
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:43,280
our, you know, strategies that we're striving for are kind of dead ends and it might suggest other

382
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:48,720
ones. What are your thoughts on that? Yes, but I don't know, I don't know what those are. I mean,

383
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:56,000
as I say, I just, you know, I mean, I must say, just going back before that,

384
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:03,840
it's very hard not to be very pessimistic until you move into this, until you take it out of the

385
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:14,000
context of materialism and the idea that paradigm shifts and innovation means technology.

386
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:24,000
It needs to also have that idea of a paradigm shift or a rebirthing needs to be something

387
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:33,280
that is socioeconomic. And how you do that, I don't know, because I did, I guess my present

388
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:39,920
thinking, and I basically said it a moment ago, is that I would love to think that it could be

389
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:48,000
bottom up, but I have a, my experience says that it needs to have some top down meaning

390
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,080
leadership. I mean, I mean, enforced on you, but, but you need, I mean, that's why Donald Trump

391
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:02,000
really intrigues me in this sense that Trump was, is extraordinary in terms of his charisma

392
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,040
and his being able to tap into what I consider the negative parts of this, the parts that encourage

393
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,840
you to feel very individualistic, not to feel you're part of the collective, not to care about

394
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:21,280
nature and so on. You know, it's all part of us. I mean, we have all these things, each one of us

395
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:29,440
contains all this stuff inside us. And he, in some extraordinary way, somehow, what's the

396
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:40,000
Waltonshowong, he had this moment that he tapped into this part of our nature,

397
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,440
which I think goes against all of this and only encourages us to go further and further and deeper

398
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:55,040
and deeper in towards the collapse of modern society. And we need, so to speak, an anti-Trump.

399
00:47:55,120 --> 00:48:02,080
You know, someone with Trump's charisma and ability to sense, forget about, you know,

400
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:07,520
whether he's articulate and intelligent, but he has an extraordinary genius for sensing something.

401
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:13,120
I agree with you, but let me ask you a scientific follow-up question to that.

402
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:16,320
Yeah, so this is not, by the way, that was not science, what I said.

403
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,440
Oh, but I know.

404
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,600
This was my personal, emotive opinion.

405
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:28,640
But scientifically is the anti-Trump, someone that would exhort and inspire the opposite

406
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:38,160
attributes, would that individual counter the go against the grain of this metabolic

407
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,600
dynamic that you're talking about, this positive energy scaling that we've seen

408
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,120
in human history and around the world?

409
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:52,960
That's the big question. That is the big question because, you know, the, you know,

410
00:48:52,960 --> 00:49:01,040
another way, a very crude way of saying, well, the origin of this continuous open-ended growth

411
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:09,440
and super linear scaling is that the principle that, you know, in our socioeconomic activity,

412
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:16,960
the optimization is that each individual wants more, you know, greed, greed being sort of the

413
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:24,640
fundamental driving force. And is that part of our DNA? Is that what's been actually happening?

414
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,400
Because by the way, greed is not necessarily always negative. I'm not even being

415
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,680
necessarily pejorative about it because that greed is also to do better, to run faster, to

416
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:45,920
whatever. So I used it in a very general, not necessarily pejorative sense.

417
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,280
So it's using that energy, turning that energy into positive energy.

418
00:49:52,560 --> 00:50:00,400
A lot of this has to do with metabolic scaling laws on energy use. And the other point that we

419
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:07,440
haven't made yet is when energy scales, even if we had the ability to scale our continued

420
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,200
energy, the environmental impact and the materials and minerals and all the other stuff scales as

421
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:22,240
well. But I think on the energy sense, for 95% plus of our history, we didn't have any external

422
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,720
metabolism because we were hunter-gatherers in Tanzania. And so I almost think that our fall

423
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,440
from grace was when we started to store energy surplus. And until energy surplus goes down

424
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:42,480
and stabilizes, we're going to have these issues. Yes, no, that's of course true. I agree with you.

425
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,200
So, but that also leads to something we haven't discussed and something I'm not an expert on

426
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:56,160
at all. And that is a source of energy and the idea that, of course, from a physical

427
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,720
viewpoint, there's enough energy to continue this or add infinite of almost the energy of the sun

428
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:12,880
is clear. We use a very small amount and our problems began. Well, they did begin, of course,

429
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:19,040
as you say, when we created surplus energy, especially from agriculture and so forth. But

430
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,760
they got amplified enormously in the industrial revolution where we found it very easy not to

431
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,960
use the energy that we are having, getting from the sun, but to use the energy that we got from

432
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:39,040
the sun and stored on the surface of the earth. And so we just just, you know, what we've done

433
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:44,720
since about 1800 is simply burnt the surface of the earth. I mean, that's what it is. We're just

434
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:51,680
burning the surface of the earth as we speak. And which by the way, you don't have to be a physicist

435
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:57,280
to know that if you're burning the surface of a sphere, it's going to get hot and the flows

436
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:02,080
of currents of air and things are going to change. So it's sort of a no brainer that you're going to

437
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:09,680
change the climate and the system is going to get warmer. So that's one of its consequences.

438
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:17,600
But what we need to do is to change from what is effectively a closed system, namely just the

439
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:24,240
energy that's already here, to return ourselves once we came to where we have an open system.

440
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:29,360
We're just using the energy of the sun, which leads us of course to this whole question about

441
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:35,680
the economics of renewables and the technology associated with it and so on. But in principle,

442
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,120
as I understand it from my colleagues who are experts in this, you know, if there were a serious

443
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,440
global program, we could turn this over and change everything in a relatively short time.

444
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:54,400
But you'd have to have dedicate, you know, you'd have to give up so much to do that.

445
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:05,360
It's not feasible. I want to focus on your core expertise, but briefly, I don't think it's possible

446
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:13,040
because we would have to continually regenerate those constantly. But let's just assume that

447
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:19,040
you're right that it is possible to get rid of fossil carbon and to replace it with renewables.

448
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,640
Let's assume for the moment that that's right. Don't we still run into the metabolic scaling

449
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:30,720
of the 1.15 if we have the same governance and cultural aspirations? Absolutely. Absolutely.

450
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:36,720
No, absolutely. And I'm very glad you brought that back because that's part of my whole sort of

451
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:45,760
bully pulpit is exactly that is that just solving, just in quotes, solving the energy problem

452
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:54,400
or global warming or whatever you want to call it is not enough because you're going to put yourself

453
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:03,280
back potentially in that situation again. It goes a hell of a long way if you could, if it's correct

454
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:12,320
that we can release ourselves from the dependence on fossil fuel would go a hell of a long way.

455
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:18,720
But you still have to deal with the social problem or the sociopolitical problem

456
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,920
that is sort of underlying this that's coming from this dynamic in social networks.

457
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,960
I want to move to some deeper, more forward-looking questions, but I have a couple more

458
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:35,680
like factual ones related to cities. So you said that cities and you explained why

459
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:47,280
scale super linearly at 1.15, not 0.75. What about the global economy? Is it a collection

460
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,320
of cities from a math standpoint or how does that map? Yes. So this is work that still has

461
00:54:54,320 --> 00:55:02,240
to be done and it's work in progress and it's something. So there's two to come from both

462
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:10,400
directions. One is that you, you know, you can say, look, the city, the city, the globe

463
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:17,120
is dominated by cities. You know, in 20 or 30 years, it'll be 70 or 80% urbanized.

464
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,000
Certainly by the end of the century, it'll be, you know, 80% urbanized, which is what

465
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,400
most developed countries or all developed countries are over 80% urbanized. So to all

466
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:35,840
intensive purposes, you can, certainly thinking longer term, you can think of the city as the

467
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:43,120
globe, as of some of all the cities. Okay. And that's one way of setting up, setting it up,

468
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,560
so to speak, mathematically and conceptually. But you could also sort of shortcut that,

469
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:58,080
meanwhile, by asking, just finding out how much energy is being used globally, how much water,

470
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:06,160
et cetera, et cetera. And then you can think of the globe, the planet, as a single entity.

471
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:11,920
Okay. Not the sum. It is the sum of everything, but it's also in the same way that you can think of

472
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:19,280
you as this, as yourself or the sum of all yourselves. And you have to do both, of course.

473
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,680
This is our first conversation. So you probably don't know a lot about my work,

474
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:30,720
but I wrote a paper called Beyond the Superorganism. And I believe that global human society,

475
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:37,520
not the hunter-gatherer cultures, but the mass of most of the developed world and those following,

476
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,920
function metabolically like an energy-hungry, mindless superorganism.

477
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:49,440
Yes, I'm afraid that's true. I had to put the emphasis on mindless, unfortunately.

478
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:58,880
Mindless in the same way that you said this was inevitable and that we build cities and

479
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:06,560
Marco Polo and Cortez in that sense. We're not, let's plan this. Let's build this out. No, it's

480
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:14,240
like those subterranean ant colonies. There's no architectural plan for those. It's a by-product

481
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:20,080
of them seeking out energy in the most efficient way for their colony. Exactly. That's the idea.

482
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:31,360
Exactly. Okay. So you have proven that cities are centralized units of society that use resources

483
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:40,480
more efficiently. And what about as people start to understand biophysical, ecological limits,

484
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:47,440
and there's many people now advocating for more decentralized models. We need to spread out and

485
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:55,760
decentralize and not have the central markets and globally interconnected things. How does that fit

486
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:03,040
in with your scaling models? If instead of having 100 huge cities in the world, we have 10,000

487
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:10,000
small cities, does that mean we're less efficient and actually have more environmental

488
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,240
ecological impact? Or what are your thoughts on that? Yeah, so that's a very tough question.

489
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:20,480
The work has not been done, by the way. And I've not given it much thought till recently and I've

490
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:27,760
not worked on it seriously. And I've only started thinking about it because of this idea of the

491
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:34,480
so-called 15-minute city, which is, do you know what I'm talking about? No. So it's been proposed,

492
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:41,760
in fact, one of my collaborators, a very interesting man, and Carlo Racci, an architect at MIT,

493
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:51,520
is one of the major proponents of this. And that is we need to sort of retrofit cities

494
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:59,280
so that you can do everything within 15 minutes of where you live. That's it. So it's localizing

495
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:08,240
this big agglomeration, you know, rather than this sort of old image, which is partially true. That

496
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:13,760
is, there's a central downtown and then there's all these layers going out to the suburbs outside

497
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:20,320
of kind of almost concentric, almost onion-like. Instead of that, you have lots of these centers,

498
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,600
which had been talked about before anyway, but now it's people are taking it quite seriously

499
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:32,960
and putting numbers to it, like making it sort of this 15-minute idea. Anyway, so that got me

500
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:41,840
thinking about that. And indeed, you know, naively, and I've not done the work, it does what you said.

501
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:48,640
It would mean that it's less efficient for the collective. You know, that is in the same way

502
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:56,000
as I said, if you, oh, here's another, here's an example that is like the one I said earlier. If you

503
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:04,080
took an elephant and you asked the equivalent biomass in mice, so it's the same number of cells,

504
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:12,000
except in one, on one side you make all those cells an elephant, on the other you make it into,

505
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:18,560
and I forget the number, you know, 200 mice are equivalent. And you ask, how much energy do they

506
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:25,120
need? An elephant, the 200 mice, if that number is right, I don't remember the number, but that

507
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:34,400
number of mice requires, I think it's 20 times as much food as that single elephant. So there's

508
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:40,880
extraordinary price to pay, you know, you've got to produce so 20 times as much food,

509
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,960
and you're going to produce 20 times as much entropy, therefore 20 times as much pollution,

510
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:55,200
and waste, and so forth. So applying that example to humans, a bunch of small cities

511
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:02,000
with the same population and same resource throughput would be an environmentally deteriorating

512
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,120
factor. Yes, they would produce much more. So if you did the same, if you took New York

513
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:14,960
and you made it into its hundred centipedes, naively, you would, you know, you would produce

514
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,400
much more pollution, you would require much more energy, and you would produce less ideas.

515
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:28,160
So did you know... That would be the idea. Did you know E.L. Wilson, he passed away?

516
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:36,640
I did know. He's someone I always wanted to meet. One of his ideas endures, and I have all of his

517
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:45,040
books, I only have one of yours, is the idea of half Earth, where humans have half the Earth and

518
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,960
all the other nature in wildlife has the rest. I'm just wondering if we just have one giant city,

519
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:56,080
I mean, how would that work? I mean, I don't think that works either. So the other end of the

520
01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:02,080
spectrum doesn't work either. Okay. Because one of the things you discover, which we only touched

521
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:10,640
on earlier, is if you start putting, because you need a system, then it turns out you actually need

522
01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,600
and you optimize the entire system. And I talked about it in terms of the forest. I said, you know,

523
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:20,800
we did work on individual trees, and then we put the trees together for the forest. It turns out

524
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:30,320
you need a distribution of sizes and in order to optimize the system. And that's roughly what we

525
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:37,280
see. It turns out that is what has evolved. So would you call that a power law? Yeah, that's

526
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:44,400
also a power law. That also works as a power law. So I often hear about power law in public

527
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:52,560
conversations that 80% of the points in the National Basketball League are scored by 20%

528
01:02:52,560 --> 01:03:00,720
of the players. Is this really a robust finding? It's a robust, but it works very, very roughly.

529
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,560
You know, rule of thumb, the 80-20 rule, as it's called, sort of works.

530
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:18,880
I don't know how close it is, but 80% of the GDP is produced by 20% of the cities or 20%

531
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,960
of the people or whatever it is. That's roughly correct. I mean, certainly what is the spirit

532
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,800
of it is certainly correct. Well, the spirit of it is what I'm curious about. How can you explain,

533
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:38,400
as a physicist, as a scientist, why that happens? Why does that 80-20 rule roughly hold?

534
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:47,520
Well, that again is the work to show that the optimum structure for optimal use of resources

535
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,920
and energy, if that's how the system, as the system has evolved and new things grow, new towns,

536
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,160
new cities, and the thing is continually adapting and evolving and minor changes.

537
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:10,160
That arranges itself following a distribution that is a power law. And, you know, just for the

538
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,920
distribution of cities, that's called Zip's Law, after a man named Zip, who discovered it in the

539
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:27,760
in the 1930s, like Kleiber discovered his law. And most entities do that. You know, the distributions

540
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:35,600
follow, roughly speaking, that rule. And that rule has that power law as its consequence,

541
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:43,680
this kind of 80-20 number, roughly. So let me ask you a difficult or at least uncomfortable

542
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:50,480
question. Again, one of these that I've saved for you specifically. If you took a time lapse,

543
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:58,560
aerial view of our planet over the last 50 years, 30 years, 100 years,

544
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:08,800
it looks a lot like a cancer growth. So there are 200 types of cancer. Do you assimilate the

545
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,280
growing form of some cities, metabolisms, and what's happening in the world to different types of

546
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:24,160
cancers using common descriptors like aggressiveness or speed growth or metastatic, or where does

547
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:32,720
this analogy hold? And where does it break down? Yeah, I don't know the answer to that. And I

548
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,600
occasionally think about it. And it may be that I don't think about it very much because

549
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:46,640
some years ago, or I don't know, probably 15 years ago or more, I was interviewed by the

550
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:55,920
economist about some of this work. And it was about the growth of cities and the growth of

551
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,800
what are called informal communities and the old language slums, basically.

552
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:11,760
And the word cancer came up in that context. And I meant it very much in terms of

553
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:24,160
the idea that you have an organism, which is sort of in a metastable situation.

554
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:31,840
And then at some stage, you know, something starts growing inside it, which maybe shouldn't be there

555
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:38,000
or should be there, whatever, but it starts growing. And in that sense, that's how I thought of

556
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:45,360
a slum or an informal community. That's something that's slightly outside, outside of

557
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:55,200
what was the host system. And this thing is growing in a way that is sort of in some way or another

558
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:02,640
violating the rules. And I referred to that as cancer without, and I got into trouble.

559
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:07,600
Because along with the word cancer, obviously, can note something.

560
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:14,240
Cancer is a physical scientific description, but it's also kind of like a verb.

561
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:20,320
Yeah, it is. No, and it carries an enormous weight. So I've been very reluctant to...

562
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:28,560
But it's a little bit... I hear you, and it just looks like visually similar.

563
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:34,640
And in fact, I suppose, I thought the question I thought you were going to ask, and maybe it was

564
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:45,120
implied by it, you know, if you were some alien, whatever, taking photographs of this planet

565
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:58,960
over the last 100,000 years, it would be for the first 95,000, maybe 98,000,

566
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:03,840
it would not much would change. I mean, there'd be seasonal changes, of course.

567
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:10,640
But the overall structure wouldn't change drastically, and it would look so. And then,

568
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:17,520
beginning that last couple of thousand years, it would have gone bonkers. It would have been all

569
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:27,040
this stuff started growing on it and taking over. And then the last 30 years, it doubled again.

570
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:33,920
Absolutely. Just going completely crazy. And you might think of that as a cancer from the outside.

571
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:42,400
That is... Oh, I mean, that's not casting aspersions on anybody except us, us as human beings.

572
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,800
I know. Cancer cells don't like to label themselves as cancer because it's...

573
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,080
No, I'm sure they don't. I mean, I'm sure they're doing what they think is...

574
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:52,640
They are doing what's best for them. And by the way,

575
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,640
cancers, literally, cancers are us. They're our DNA. They are us.

576
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,320
So is cancer in a human body an example of a super-linear scaling?

577
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:11,280
No, but cancer, no, it doesn't, actually. What is interesting about cancers is they

578
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:23,040
are left to their own devices, so to speak. That is, if the body went on living forever

579
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:27,280
and the cancer just kept growing, it would do what the body did. It would grow and then eventually

580
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:34,960
stop growing. And some cancers do that. They grow quickly and then they stop. There are some.

581
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:42,320
But usually what happens before then, of course, they metastasize that is they start

582
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:47,360
doing bad things elsewhere and then shutting down organs and sort of the

583
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:53,600
terrible things that lead to mortality. So let me shift this to forward-looking.

584
01:09:54,160 --> 01:10:01,280
Given what you've laid out here on the metabolism and energy use of organisms

585
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:08,000
and outside of the body exosomatically, how would a physicist listening to this program

586
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:15,760
who understands metabolism of cities and the inevitable end of linear scaling because we are

587
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:22,720
on a finite system, the linear scaling of cities, advise government planners on planning?

588
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:31,200
Well, let's make it first of all local. And I've interacted with many cities.

589
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:43,200
This work, I would be very reluctant to be prescriptive to actually say,

590
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:56,960
you know, I'm not a McKinsey. But the thing I tell cities is that you should be cognizant

591
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:03,760
of these scaling laws because unbeknownst to you and all your predecessors that have been

592
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:12,880
city planners and builders and so on and extending cities and so forth,

593
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:24,240
there was this dynamic that is going on in a kind of hidden way. And if you build a city in

594
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:31,760
violation of the scaling laws, you're going to run into trouble. And indeed, the history of

595
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:37,840
building major cities, as well as minor ones, but big cities, which, you know, like

596
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:47,040
Brazil and Islamabad and Canberra, even Washington DC, building cities, de novo, planning cities.

597
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:51,360
I don't think there's a single one that has been successful.

598
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:59,680
You know, I mean, they've always been highly criticized. They don't work. They tend to be

599
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:07,680
soulless. People are very unhappy, dissatisfied. Now, eventually, those organic forces of nature

600
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:15,520
take over. And eventually, Washington DC turns from being a boring city that most people don't

601
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:22,640
want to go to and live in, to a city that has only happened in the last maybe 20 years or 30 years,

602
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,720
become a city that's like every other big city of that size, exciting, interesting,

603
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:35,280
lots of young people, ideas floating around and so forth. But it took, you know, 100 years to do

604
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:43,360
that, whatever it was. Brazilia is just beginning to turn that corner. It was built in the 1960s

605
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:55,920
and is at last beginning to somehow evolve into a real city. So, and the point is what happens is,

606
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,600
of course, people determine the structure of a city. So, people don't, you know, you know what

607
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:06,640
it's like, I always give this example, because I hang around universities, typically, you know,

608
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:13,360
they build some new quadrangle or whatever in a city, and they have the various buildings around it,

609
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:19,840
and then they put in paths going across it to go from A to B. And of course, then they open it all

610
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:26,160
up, and the students and faculty start using it. And some of those paths they use, but many of those

611
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:30,560
paths they don't, and they start walking across the grass in a certain direction, and they form

612
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:36,080
their own. Well, that's the sort of thing that happens in a city. Gradually, the city organically

613
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:43,760
adjusts to optimize whatever it is, the function of that. In that case, this university is four.

614
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:51,680
So, that's what happens to these cities. The city evolves and changes so as to optimize what it's

615
01:13:51,680 --> 01:14:00,080
there for, and it becomes a real place. So, my advice is follow the, be cognizant when you do it,

616
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:06,880
of those scaling laws, because most of the things that are done in the building of new towns and

617
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:13,520
cities is really sort of almost rules of thumb. So, if you followed the scaling laws, you would make

618
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,880
some decisions that would prevent disasters 10 or 20 years from now because of the scaling laws.

619
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:25,760
That's right. They're there to prevent disasters and mitigate or at least minimize. I wouldn't

620
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:31,440
say even prevent. I wouldn't be as arrogant as to say that. Minimize. I would say minimize disasters

621
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:37,600
that are going to occur because of some, you know, we decide, oh yeah, we should put a park here,

622
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:41,600
we should build this building here, and it should be this time, we should do this and that.

623
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:47,040
So, on a national level, the horses already left the barn. I'm afraid so.

624
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,640
Yeah, but on a local level, we can maybe take this wisdom.

625
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:57,360
Absolutely. Or if you are building a new city, which doesn't happen very often,

626
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:03,120
any longer in the United States, but is happening elsewhere, please for goodness sake,

627
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:11,040
be cognizant of that. And not just of the scaling laws themselves, but of the underlying dynamic

628
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:18,640
that is encapsulated in those scaling laws and to do with social interactions and also to think

629
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:28,560
about how those fold into the functionality of what you want that city to be. It's so interesting.

630
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:36,160
I'm taking up a lot of your time, but I want to get to some of the key questions that I had

631
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:46,640
planned to ask you in no particular order. Do the energy use curves of dying societies resemble

632
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:52,560
those of biological creatures dying of old age? Oh boy, I don't know the answer to that. I don't

633
01:15:52,560 --> 01:16:01,280
know. That would be a very interesting question to do some work on actually. I suspect it's extremely

634
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:09,760
hard to get data. One of the things that is very hard in this, which surprised me in this work on

635
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:17,760
cities especially, is difficulty in getting data. The data is out there, but it's all modern data.

636
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:28,880
You'd also like to get data from 1920, 1820, 1620. Historical data geographically spread around

637
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:35,200
so that you can start to address these very questions. Now, some of my younger colleagues

638
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:42,720
looked into this in terms of pre-Columbian cities in Mexico, for example, where there's

639
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:49,360
archaeological, a lot of huge amount of archaeological data, and using that data to show that urban

640
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:56,480
systems, ancient urban systems, actually followed these scaling laws. That was very encouraging,

641
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:03,040
actually. But the question you're asking would be very hard to eke out data. We're very interesting

642
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:10,880
to think what you could use for proxies for the decaying city and what are you going to measure

643
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:17,120
that would tell you about it. I mean, there is data, and people have started to look at it,

644
01:17:17,120 --> 01:17:22,160
and I haven't followed it very carefully that came out of our work, looking at ancient Rome,

645
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:29,600
because there you have the build-up and then the sustenance of a powerful, all-powerful

646
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:38,400
city empire, and then its decay into the first part of the millennium.

647
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:45,920
So, in your opinion, are we running our governments more like cities or more like companies?

648
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:48,960
And what does this mean for the livelihood of our nations?

649
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:53,600
That's a question, believe it or not, where we're sort of doing ongoing research.

650
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,880
So, let me just tell you, I can't answer that question directly. It's probably more like cities,

651
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:06,960
actually, but we did ask the question, we asked two questions that have been worked on.

652
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,840
One is, first of all, about universities, people we've asked about. So, there was, you know,

653
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:17,040
are they more like cities or companies kind of question? I won't go into that, but the question

654
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:23,040
maybe more direct relevance came out of a conversation which I'm sure you've had informally

655
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:30,800
with some friend or colleague where you sit around and you bitch about administration and bureaucracy

656
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:37,040
and how it's getting in the way and it's destroying everything. You know, for us, you know, why is the

657
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:40,960
National Science Foundation so full of idiots that don't understand?

658
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,400
What is the role of that bureaucracy with metabolism?

659
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:51,840
Doing, you know, what is all that? So, we, myself and a colleague started talking about this,

660
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:57,520
you know, bitching, and then it sort of hit me, actually, that, you know, I said, you know,

661
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:06,880
is it conceivable that actually these bureaucracies are actually quite efficient and optimized

662
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:12,800
for the collective but are very bad for the individual? That is, at the individual level

663
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,840
dealing with it, it just always seems to get in the way, there's too much of it and so on. But

664
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:24,320
actually, if you looked at the whole system and the function of whatever that agency is or that

665
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:34,000
company or that whatever, actually, it's tending towards optimization. So, it's got a very long

666
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:41,520
story short. We, after several attempts at writing little white papers that got summarily rejected

667
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,600
by funding agencies, eventually it was picked up and given very large funding by the National

668
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:54,560
Science Foundation. So, we have this big grant to do that and we have a, we have some extremely

669
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,720
good people, people that work with us and we have someone at Harvard Business School,

670
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:06,160
someone in the Sloan School at MIT and so forth. So, what are you mostly doing with your time now?

671
01:20:06,160 --> 01:20:12,240
What questions are like keeping you up at night that are you're fascinated by and want to pursue?

672
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:20,880
Well, lots of them, too many questions, but the two major things, and by the way, at the same time,

673
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:29,120
unfortunately, because I'm into, well into my 80s, dealing with health issues myself, my wife,

674
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:37,040
inevitably. So, I don't, and I obviously don't have quite the same energy to stay up to two or

675
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:41,600
three in the morning doing the calculations. You seem like you have a hell of a lot of energy.

676
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:50,160
I'm doing sort of okay, but nevertheless, so with that caveat, the two things that I'm most

677
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:56,640
interested in, of the many that I'm working on with colleagues, one that's been a theme throughout

678
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:03,680
all of this work, and I've never really completed it, and that is, I have this sort of long-term,

679
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:15,040
morbid interest in aging and mortality, death, and understanding what that process is, and in

680
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:22,960
particular, to understand why it is that human beings live of the order of a hundred years,

681
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:27,040
where does the hundred years come from? And that, in a sense, that's why I've got me into all this

682
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:34,720
work, that, you know, just a side personal comment, that I come from a family of short-lived males,

683
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:41,680
you know, but my, they all die in their 50s and 60s. Occasionally, someone manages to reach 70,

684
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:48,000
but so, I assumed I would be dead in my mid-60s, and I started to worry about this question,

685
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:52,720
which got me interested in the many of these questions that we're now talking about,

686
01:21:53,520 --> 01:22:00,480
and I've somehow violated the genetic rule of my family, because I'm now 83 and I'm still going,

687
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:05,760
so that's interesting of itself, you know, what is going on here with that, so that interests me very

688
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:15,760
much, and I'm, but the other question, which I suppose is related to it in a way, is the whole

689
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:22,400
question that we've touched on is the sustainability, and therefore the mortality of the anthroposphere,

690
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:30,160
of this fantastic socioeconomic system that we have developed, so, you know, I'm one of these

691
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:37,360
people that don't fear the fact that human beings will somehow go extinct, I don't think that's

692
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:45,120
going to happen, and I sort of don't care, what I care about is that we're socioeconomic human

693
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:50,240
beings will go extinct, I don't want to lose all this, it's fantastic what we've created,

694
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:58,240
even though it has built into it, in a certain sense, its own demise, can we save it and keep

695
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:03,760
it going, and try to understand that, so we discussed this earlier in the conversation,

696
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:13,120
but really trying to develop a science of the anthroposphere, considering it as an integrated

697
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:21,280
whole, that is the planet is an integrated whole of socioeconomic activity, and I more recently

698
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,520
got much more serious about it, because one of the things I didn't say earlier was that,

699
01:23:28,560 --> 01:23:35,520
unbeknownst to me, a few years ago, a man whom I did know, named Will Steffen, an Australian,

700
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:43,600
I think he was an anthropologist by training, but Will was, I think, the first person to put

701
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:52,800
together data of material and socioeconomic metrics for the planet as a whole, and he published this

702
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:59,360
stuff, and all of them looked like hockey sticks, of course, you know, they're zooming up, and the

703
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:06,080
data he collected goes back to somewhere in the fifties, and he turned all this the great

704
01:24:06,080 --> 01:24:15,120
acceleration, okay, so he left it at that, and it became central piece for scientists working on

705
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:21,440
their anthroposphere, now I only came across this by word of mouth a couple of years ago,

706
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:28,240
and I was very excited when I learned that this data existed, because then I could go back to

707
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:35,040
what I had been thinking about much earlier, several years ago, but I'd stopped thinking about it, or

708
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:41,600
so I put it aside, because there wasn't data, and I come from a tradition of physics, that is,

709
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:51,120
we do theory, we make models, we make, we create ideas and concepts, very important to make

710
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:56,320
predictions, to understand what's been done, and make predictions that we can test, and so forth,

711
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:03,120
but this was devoid of data, so I was sort of left hanging, and I thought sometime in the future

712
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:09,600
there will be, now it has happened, it's very crude, but enough, and the good news for me,

713
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:17,200
as a scientist, is I wrote down some equations, which I won't go into, I wrote, and for the

714
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:23,120
anthroposphere, and it made some predictions, they're really post-dictions, because they're for

715
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:29,360
socioeconomic activity, and the data, it agrees beautifully with the data, and so that has given

716
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:35,840
me hope, that we can continue this, and really, you know, this is very much scratching the surface

717
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,160
of work in progress, that we can really make a, you know, a serious theory, or put it slightly

718
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:51,120
differently, a conceptual, quantitative, analytic, mathematical framework, that we can start, start

719
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:57,920
thinking seriously, in terms of something I termed in my book, sort of grand unified theory of

720
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:04,800
sustainability, because we do need to bring everybody into this conversation, and I want to

721
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,920
create a framework where everybody can sort of get involved in it, and we can really come to terms

722
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:16,560
with all these wonderful questions you brought up in the last hour or so. What keeps me up at night

723
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:24,000
is very simple, is how do we save the biosphere and the 10 million other species we share the

724
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:34,000
planet with, but how do we reduce our environmental impact without the violence and collapse that

725
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:40,320
would require us to tighten our belt, and how to how to marry those two things. On your first question

726
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:46,720
though, Jeffrey, and you know, we could come back and do a second podcast on this, but

727
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:54,160
just out of curiosity, do you personally use intermittent fasting? And a more important question

728
01:26:54,160 --> 01:27:02,560
is, how would fasting and reducing the caloric input as an individual organism affect, like

729
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:09,040
consciously having a trump card on your natural impulses at the level of the individual, how would

730
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:16,240
that affect your metabolic scaling and age and all the other things? Do you have an opinion on that?

731
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:21,520
It would not affect the metabolic scaling per se, but it would lead to longer life.

732
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:27,440
Really? You're confident of that? I'm very confident that if you were to reduce,

733
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:35,840
if you could reduce your metabolism, you will extend your life. Now, how much is obviously

734
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:41,680
individualistic, and for some people it may not work very much. So do you reduce your

735
01:27:42,240 --> 01:27:48,800
caloric intake? I don't, actually. Well, I don't eat very much. I'm old. I don't eat very much.

736
01:27:54,320 --> 01:28:03,360
So I went through a long period where I did, and I lost 30 pounds. I was 180 and I went down

737
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:08,800
to 150 without even realizing it. Yeah, it was terrible. And I freaked out when the doctor,

738
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:13,680
you know, I went for some, you know, this got sort of nothing to with anything, but I went for my

739
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:19,920
annual exam and I was standing there and naked, and the doctor looked at me and said, Jeffrey,

740
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:27,120
come into the next room. I want you to look in the mirror. And I looked and it was quite sobering,

741
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:35,520
I have to tell you. And I did think, gee whiz, I better do something. But I'm now, but I did

742
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:42,720
reduce it to what I was naturally, you know, more naturally earlier. I now stay around 165 to 70.

743
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:49,600
So in that sense, the answer is yes. But I don't, I'm not, you know, I'm not obsessive about it.

744
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:55,920
And it's not sort of part of my consciousness. I agree with that. And it seems logical and

745
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:01,040
scientifically grounded. The question is, is how do we apply that from the level of the individual

746
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:06,240
to the level of society? I think that's extraordinarily difficult because of the, again,

747
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:11,920
the commercial pressures on food and especially fast food and so on. I mean, that's another one

748
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:18,960
of these things where, you know, sometimes in my darkest moments, I think, yeah, there's a lot to

749
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:26,720
be said for benevolent dictatorship, you know. Yeah. But I'm such a committed Democrat. And

750
01:29:26,720 --> 01:29:31,200
now you're Democrat, it's ridiculous. Yeah, those two words are, you know what I mean?

751
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:36,000
It's don't fit in the same sentence. So I've taken up a lot of your time. I have a few questions

752
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,440
that I ask all my guests. And this has been great. I love your work. And I've learned some new

753
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:47,200
things in this conversation. So you've thought about and worked as a macro observer at the Santa

754
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:54,080
Fe Institute for a long career on these issues. Do you have any personal advice to the viewers of

755
01:29:54,080 --> 01:30:00,800
this program for their own lives, given the global upheaval and the anthroposphere and the

756
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:06,720
metacrisis and everything else? Do you have any personal advice given your lifetime of experience

757
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:12,960
and wisdom? Well, I'm very reluctant to give advice, I have to tell you. Just my... You're a scientist.

758
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:18,320
Yeah, exactly. So my science gets in the way in a certain sense. On the other hand,

759
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:27,200
I'm a human being and you know... Exactly. So, you know, I guess it's sort of

760
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:33,520
hops on what we talked about earlier. And I try to do it myself and I don't succeed.

761
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:41,040
And that is just be much more cognizant of the fact that I'm really part of the community.

762
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:48,400
And therefore, the community is part of me. You know, I'm carrying that around with me. And the

763
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:56,160
community is everything from my community of colleagues here at the Institute to the community

764
01:30:56,160 --> 01:31:03,840
I'm part of in terms of a city, Santa Fe. Part of a community I am as part of being an American,

765
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:09,040
living in America. I'm part of being a human being that we're all interrelated, interconnected.

766
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:15,920
And, you know, it sounds again a bit hokey. You know, it doesn't matter what side I'm on,

767
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:22,960
but you know, people dying in Ukraine or Gaza or wherever, Syria, that hurts.

768
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:31,280
Because the thing that I began to realize in addition to what we've already said is that,

769
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:36,960
as far as I can tell, we are the only part of the universe that actually cares.

770
01:31:39,200 --> 01:31:44,880
It's kind of sobering. I mean, I love nature and I can say all those things about nature

771
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:51,680
that I said about my fellow human beings and community, that I'm also that advice that to

772
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:57,360
recognize that you are part of nature and nature is part of you. That's where we came from.

773
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:05,600
And, you know, we're in it together kind of thing. But there is, you know, but the fact is

774
01:32:06,160 --> 01:32:14,880
that nature doesn't care. You know, it does not care. We invented, as far as I can tell,

775
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,880
ethics and morality. We've done terrible things and we're doing terrible things,

776
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:28,000
but we also do wonderful things and we need to be conscious that we are the only ones.

777
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:34,400
And that is an incredible burden and incredible responsibility and we should all be aware of it.

778
01:32:34,400 --> 01:32:41,760
So it's me being, we used the word spiritual earlier. I'm not a religious person. I'm not

779
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:49,440
a believer, but that's my version of belief. I think it's beautiful. We don't have the right

780
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:57,840
to assume that this story is inevitable and we are the only species able to care.

781
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:03,200
That's well said. We're the agency of care. You know, I mean,

782
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:10,480
and that is a hell of a responsibility. We're also, by the way, the agency of understanding.

783
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:16,480
And we're also the agency of metabolic impact.

784
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:25,040
All wrapped into one. And all of that stuff. The thing I loved about my own work, I have to tell

785
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:33,280
you, is the recognition that all these things which are considered disparate and interconnected

786
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:38,640
sort of don't have much to do with one another. And I've kind of, you know, put into boxes.

787
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:45,440
Actually, it turns out they're all interconnected and they all do the same thing. I mean, in very

788
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:53,200
generic terms. But they're all manifestations of the same theme. They're all variations on

789
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:58,400
the same theme. But that is extraordinary. For the record, I also love that about your work.

790
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:05,360
So you have been around universities and young people for a long time. How would you change

791
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:12,480
your advice? What advice would you give to an 18, 22-year-old human who is starting to understand

792
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:16,400
the broader biophysical backdrop of their time?

793
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:29,440
Well, do science. I believe in science, strongly. Be a humanist. Read the great books.

794
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:41,600
And recognize that the two most important things in the universe for human beings

795
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:47,440
are love and understanding. And if you could, I mean, I say those. It's not that I've heard

796
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:54,080
here to those. I've tried, but I've failed, of course. But I try to keep those as part of my life.

797
01:34:54,800 --> 01:35:00,960
I can see those right beneath the surface of your science and scaling. I can see those.

798
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:07,040
This has been an amazing conversation. And I've never met you before this phone call. So

799
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:12,320
hopefully we can stay in touch. And I'd love to help you with your work.

800
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:20,240
If you were to come back in six months for a follow-up, what is one topic that we would

801
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:25,520
just focus on that topic that you're extremely passionate about that you think is relevant

802
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:30,480
to human futures as esoteric as it might be? Do you have anything like that?

803
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:36,480
Well, I would, I mean, we've already discussed a lot of it. But I think because that's what I'm

804
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:44,560
thinking about so much recently is it would be this long-term future of the planet, global

805
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,040
sustainability. Are you writing a new book on that? Are you actively researching that?

806
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:55,200
I'm actively researching it. It's the question about writing another book. You know, when I

807
01:35:55,200 --> 01:36:02,560
wrote my book, one book, I mean, I've edited all kinds of things, books and so forth. But to write

808
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:14,400
solo this book, I put called Scale, which I was a, you know, I'm not a natural writer in the sense

809
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:20,480
that I labor overwriting. I'm happy with the book, but I do labor over it. You know, every

810
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:26,400
sentence is like, you know, pulling teeth, feeling, which is crazy. You know, I'm warranted,

811
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:30,000
but I do it. Well, on the next one, just get a ghostwriter. Get all your ideas out and get a

812
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:38,480
ghostwriter. That book, by the way, the book Scale, I was strongly urged by some very, very

813
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,680
influential people extreme that I, because I was sitting on my butt, not doing anything,

814
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:51,680
that get a ghostwriter. I had some extremely good people willing to write it. And that actually

815
01:36:51,680 --> 01:36:56,640
got to me in the end, because I said in the end, you know, I can't do that. I'm too much of a control

816
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:03,600
freak. Yeah, these are my words. Exactly. So, but, and I have even thought about it for, I know,

817
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,480
so I said, after that, I'll never write another book again. I sort of put everything into that.

818
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:16,320
There's no way. But two things changed that might make me change my mind. One is,

819
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:25,280
I realized that I sh that book in a way could have been three books or four books, actually,

820
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:35,360
because it's and one of the things I tried to do in that book was explain everything, meaning

821
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:40,880
I didn't want to pull things out of the hat. I didn't want it sort of gee whiz and so on.

822
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:49,120
And the good thing about that now is that if I write another book, I can point to the old book

823
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:54,000
and say, look, it's already there. Yeah, it's already there. Go read those pages. You're fine.

824
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:00,720
You know, well, I'm just going to tell you this. I encourage you to write another book or some

825
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:07,920
version of it because I think at the core of your work is the fundamental question that humanity

826
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:16,400
faces, which is can knowledge and understanding of metabolism impact our metabolism?

827
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:23,520
Yes, that's a very interesting way of stating it. Yes, that's exactly right. That's exactly

828
01:38:23,520 --> 01:38:28,080
courted. But by the way, I've got one other thing I wanted to say about why I would write it. And

829
01:38:28,080 --> 01:38:38,080
this shows a slightly negative side of my personality. And that is, you know, I know many

830
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:42,800
of the science writers that have been very successful and I shot name names. But one of the

831
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:50,880
things I began to realize is that they were sort of writing the same book again, and they get more

832
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:57,040
for it and so on. And I was sort of getting frustrated. Why did they do that? You know,

833
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:03,120
it was and I thought, shit, maybe that's what I should I should actually rewrite some of this

834
01:39:03,120 --> 01:39:09,040
and so on and cash it. And then the other thing was I've worked and it came yesterday. Here's my friend

835
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:17,360
Venky Ramakrishnan, who is a well known, he just this book just came out. Why we die. Oh, wow.

836
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:26,480
And Venky is a wonderful man. He's a Nobel Prize winner. And he's a Cambridge University in England,

837
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:30,240
lovely man. And he's talked to me a lot about this. And I'm glad to see him,

838
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,560
even though I've not written much about it, he referenced me. But I saw that book and it was

839
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,680
again one of these things which happens. I think, bloody hell, I should have written my book on

840
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:44,960
aging and death, even though there's, you know, there's a whole chapter to it. But people don't

841
01:39:44,960 --> 01:39:51,920
notice that. So it's part of this ego. There's this kind of ego driven thing. Narcissism,

842
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:57,360
there's ego, but there's also emergence. Because since you wrote read, wrote your book,

843
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:01,760
you're learning about interconnected things that you have deeper insights now.

844
