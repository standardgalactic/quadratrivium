1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,900
The

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,720
world to come will be different from our expectations.

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,460
The arc of human history informs the trajectory of our future.

4
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:33,740
We need to know who we are and how we got here, the ecology, biology, and physics.

5
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:40,300
To know which paths remain open to us and which lead to dead ends.

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:46,220
Four and a half billion years ago, stardust coalesced to form a planet.

7
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:51,220
A billion years later, simple life emerged.

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:59,460
By 500 million years ago, a profusion of life had exploded on our blue-green planet.

9
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,140
Fast forward to 66 million years ago, and dinosaurs were taken out by our planet's

10
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:10,980
most recent mass extinction.

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:16,980
And small shrew-like survivors continued an evolutionary line that would eventually

12
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:20,540
become us.

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:28,860
Of all our hominid ancestors, one species would ultimately remain homo sapiens, a creature

14
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:40,300
variously curious, creative, kind, cruel, cooperative, competitive, combative, and clever.

15
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:46,540
When Earth's climate warmed and stabilized around 10,000 years ago, homo sapiens tribes

16
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:55,540
who pivoted en masse to agriculture and pastoralism out-reproduced their hunter-gatherer cousins.

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,660
Unbeknownst to them and to most of us, this was a planet-changing event.

18
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:08,060
Sustained by new agricultural surplus, these early humans slowly spread out around the

19
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,900
globe, expanding trade and technology.

20
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:19,460
For thousands of years, the average annual growth in the size of the human economy would

21
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:24,580
be unnoticeable from one generation to the next.

22
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:31,380
By the 16th century, however, more complex social organization and advanced navigational

23
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:37,620
technology kick-started a unique period in human history.

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:44,300
Yet even with these advances, human cultures remained powered by biomass in the muscles

25
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:49,700
of humans and our draft animals, limiting growth.

26
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:56,940
Until in the early 19th century, 10,000 years after the agricultural revolution, humans

27
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,420
discovered how to extract fossil energy and materials from under-Earth's surface to

28
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,740
boost their economies.

29
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:14,460
This new discovery of geologically stored sunlight in the form of coal, oil and gas

30
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,180
changed everything.

31
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,460
For the first time, human and animal labor played second fiddle to the power of these

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,180
new energy sources.

33
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,180
When combined with a machine, a gallon of gasoline could output the same work in a few

34
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,500
minutes as a person laboring for an entire month.

35
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:47,060
We increasingly replaced manual human tasks with machines at a tiny fraction of the cost.

36
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,740
The result?

37
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:54,540
Higher profits, higher wages and cheaper goods.

38
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,300
Sudden access to this bank account of stored carbon energy turbocharged our populations,

39
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,380
access to good services and technology, and quadrupled our economic growth rate.

40
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,820
Yet humanity's great acceleration was still ahead.

41
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,460
In the latter half of the 20th century, with this new power source and an upgrade from

42
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:25,300
coal to higher quality liquid oil, the human economy's average growth rate doubled yet

43
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,660
again.

44
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:34,020
To now over 30 times what it had averaged during the last few thousand years.

45
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,980
Compared to a global labor force of around 5 billion real humans, the machines and work

46
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:49,020
powered by access to buried carbon energy added the equivalent power of 500 billion

47
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,100
human workers.

48
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:58,100
Access to these fossil energies and materials brought billions more humans into existence

49
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:06,740
and brought billions more out of poverty and led to the creation of new myths, institutions

50
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,220
and expectations.

51
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:17,020
Our ancestors' lives were tightly linked to the natural flows of the earth, the sun,

52
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,020
the rain and the soil.

53
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:26,860
But during this moonshot of growth and consumption, our fundamental tether to nature was first

54
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,420
neglected and then forgotten.

55
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,620
The main inputs to our economies were now mostly free.

56
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:43,540
We nearly had to pay for the cost of their extraction, not the cost of their creation,

57
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,420
their true worth, nor their pollution.

58
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:53,940
To our ancestors, the benefits from carbon energy would have appeared indistinguishable

59
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,780
from magic.

60
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:04,300
And instead of appreciating this giant one-time windfall, we developed stories that our new

61
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:11,060
found wealth and progress had emerged purely from human ingenuity.

62
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:18,740
We had become energy blind.

63
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:23,980
Energy is and always will be the currency of life.

64
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,700
Animals were the first investors.

65
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,980
Obtaining a larger energy surplus gives an animal a competitive advantage for survival

66
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,420
and reproduction.

67
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:42,300
This role of surplus energy is a core driver of the natural world and dictates what can

68
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,900
and can't happen.

69
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:51,260
We rarely think about it or talk about it, but we're all alive during the carbon pulse,

70
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:56,900
the few hundred years where humans are drawing down earth's energy battery millions of times

71
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,300
faster than it was trickle-charged by daily photosynthesis.

72
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:09,140
Chemical hydrocarbons at a vast scale have enormously increased the surplus energy available

73
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,340
to human economies.

74
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,980
Pulses, by definition, don't last forever.

75
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,900
High-quality ores and energy deposits are now mostly things of the past.

76
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,140
Plenty remains, but it's of lower quality and both more costly and ecologically destructive

77
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,300
to extract.

78
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,740
In nature, there are countless examples where energy exists, but the effort to obtain it

79
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:41,300
is so large that the meal is effectively off the menu.

80
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:48,300
In our lifetimes, society will have to redirect increasing amounts of our energy surplus towards

81
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:54,660
obtaining the surplus itself, leaving less affordable energy to support many of our current

82
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,900
economic activities.

83
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,660
One day, the energy it will cost to extract energy will be so large it won't make sense

84
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,060
to do so, even though resources remain.

85
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:15,540
Energy depletion will act as a growing tax on human societies.

86
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:22,980
In this unprecedented era of large surplus, we have excelled at combining energy and materials

87
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:27,860
into technology and inventions that improve the human experience.

88
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,660
New technology can allow us to use resources more efficiently or it can transform natural

89
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,740
flows into energy.

90
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:42,860
But mostly, technology just creates new ways for humans to consume and builds higher future

91
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,460
requirements for energy and materials.

92
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,380
Things that are more complex require more energy.

93
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,500
When we add nodes to a supply chain, each connection requires energy to maintain.

94
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:03,020
The complexity of our globally interconnected system currently requires the equivalent of

95
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:12,940
170 billion light bulbs constantly turned on, burning brightly, powered by the carbon pulse.

96
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,620
Even rebuildable technology that harnesses the sun and the wind grows our total consumption

97
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,340
and has not yet reduced the use of carbon energy globally.

98
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:31,260
Most people believe that money is real wealth, yet everything we spend money on requires

99
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,420
energy to mine, create, deliver, run, maintain, and dispose of.

100
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:45,220
In this way, money is ultimately a direct claim on energy and resources.

101
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:51,700
More economic stories assert that with more money, we can create more of anything.

102
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,960
The truth is, we cannot create energy.

103
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:02,220
We both extract it and burn it faster by using technology and printing money.

104
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,940
Natural capital, particularly energy, is the true foundation of our monetary systems.

105
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:17,060
As we create more money, we don't create more resources, we merely access them faster.

106
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:23,620
The highest sustained growth rate of human economies ever before and likely ever again

107
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:29,460
peaked 50 years ago when oil production growth was at its highest.

108
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,180
But rather than living within our means, we found creative ways to extend growth for a

109
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,420
while longer.

110
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:43,140
We created complex supply chains, outsourcing the heavy lifting to countries with cheaper

111
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,460
labor.

112
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,420
We turned to debt in a large way to maintain high levels of consumption, a behavior that

113
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:56,380
accelerated in 2008 and has gone into overdrive since 2020.

114
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,300
Debt allows us to spend resources from the future and call it economic growth.

115
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:07,780
This phenomenon has become so pervasive in the last 50 years that we think it's normal

116
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,860
to consume today and pay tomorrow.

117
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:17,460
The developed world is now using debt to enable the extraction of things we couldn't otherwise

118
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,460
afford to extract.

119
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,100
To produce things we otherwise couldn't afford to consume.

120
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:30,100
This strategy has an expiration date because all this new money will one day be spent on

121
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:34,940
real things requiring energy.

122
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:42,660
Enabled by an extraordinary but temporary energy surplus, the human economy is now over

123
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,340
1,000 times bigger than it was just five centuries ago.

124
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,140
Most of the benefits of this one-time geological surplus now flow to a fraction of people,

125
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:00,700
not to the rest of living humans, nor future generations.

126
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,260
As we extract minerals and burn fossil carbon to support modern living standards, their

127
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:12,260
waste streams are in turn diminishing the life support systems of other species and

128
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,940
future beings.

129
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:22,900
The impact of our global energy metabolism on nature has been tragic and is now accelerating,

130
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:29,060
resulting in, among other things, animal bird and fish populations dropping by 50% since

131
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:36,300
the 1970s, plastic now weighing more than all animals on land and in the sea, and a

132
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:44,220
child born today being expected to outlive Earth's coral reefs.

133
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:52,580
As a culture, we have recently, but almost entirely, financialized the human experience.

134
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:58,940
Not only have we parsed the rich fabric of human life into a single monetary marker,

135
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,500
but in doing so, we've used the wrong prices.

136
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,780
The price of money is wrong, because we grow it with a keystroke with no tether to finite

137
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,380
natural capital.

138
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:19,020
The price of energy is wrong, because we don't treat it as the extraordinary, irreplaceable

139
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:24,860
resource it is, non-renewable on any human timescale.

140
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:31,140
And in setting prices on everything, we've lost sight of the large cost their use has

141
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:34,220
on Earth's ecosystems.

142
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:41,500
This biophysical story is all connected in an emergent and unexpected way.

143
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:48,700
As the carbon pulse boosted our economies, our institutions and governments self-organized

144
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,140
around expectations of growth.

145
00:13:52,140 --> 00:14:00,140
Now, 8 billion members of a social species collectively seek profits, which are linked

146
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,620
to energy, which is linked to fossil hydrocarbons and minerals.

147
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,940
Growth, as measured by increases in GDP, is now required for stability.

148
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:19,220
We have arrived at a place where we as a culture have outsourced our decisions and

149
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,580
planning to the financial system.

150
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:31,620
The market's compulsion to grow now outcompetes any alternative paths of wisdom or constraint.

151
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,340
The system is no longer in anyone's control.

152
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:45,300
The human species, at least to this point, has become a mindless, insatiable, energy-hungry

153
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,300
superorganism.

154
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:59,820
The superorganism is an emergent phenomenon of the animals that comprise it, us.

155
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,500
Human beings are related to all other creatures on Earth.

156
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:11,220
We are the product of an unbroken chain connecting to the first life, which means that hidden

157
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,260
beneath our stated motivations of what we do every day in industrial society, we are

158
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:23,740
driven to pursue the same neurochemical brain rewards our ancestors pursued.

159
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,900
This has huge implications for our behaviors, our economies and our futures.

160
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,500
Reaching for our phone to see if someone liked our Facebook post or to see if Bitcoin

161
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,380
is up or down, aren't really our goals.

162
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:46,220
We are in reality just seeking the same brain rewards that led to success for our hunter-gatherer

163
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,220
ancestors.

164
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:56,180
Dopamine is a molecule that in animals and in humans leads to motivation and action.

165
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:03,780
In a materially rich modern world, the habituation to the action of consumption leads to the

166
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:11,780
wanting of things, culture-wide, being stronger than the reward we get from having them.

167
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:17,540
This is a fundamental problem for an economic system that's turning billions of barrels

168
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:23,940
of oil into microliters of dopamine.

169
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:31,500
As a carryover from ancestral tribal life, we are highly tuned to social signals, comparing

170
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,660
ourselves to others seeking approval, acceptance and jockeying for status.

171
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:44,740
With material and now digital wealth as today's primary status signal, consumerism is now

172
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:52,260
largely based on having as much or more than those around us, rather than focusing on what

173
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:57,580
we may actually need.

174
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Modern humans are still tribal beings.

175
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,420
We staunchly support those in our in-groups and easily ostracize out-groups, from trivial

176
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:13,260
divisions like sports teams to political affiliation, race or nationality.

177
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:20,020
Our evolution has primed us to blame other humans for situations we don't like or understand.

178
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:32,020
We have rich, creative and colorful imaginations that reside in the virtual worlds of our minds.

179
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:40,100
The human brain can imagine and verbalize limitless combinations of physical impossibilities,

180
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:46,900
sustainable outposts on Mars, self-perpetuating energy machines, and an economy based on

181
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:53,780
physical consumption growing continually for centuries.

182
00:17:53,780 --> 00:18:00,940
In ancestral times, these virtual worlds overlapped with the physical worlds we inhabited, making

183
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,780
us more content and effective as a tribal unit.

184
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:12,140
But in a culture of vast material wealth, information overload and social media, it's

185
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:18,580
increasingly difficult for us to separate fantasy from reality.

186
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:25,500
When these individual virtual worlds connect with the virtual worlds of others, the result

187
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:32,580
is widespread shared beliefs that money is real, that our current wealth is due mostly

188
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:41,220
to our cleverness, and that technology will lead to limitless growth.

189
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:47,180
When we look to others to try and understand our complex modern world, as social beings

190
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:54,780
who said it, becomes more important than logic or the quality of the evidence, celebrity

191
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:01,460
and group affiliation now matter more than truth.

192
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,220
Our stone age brains are no match for the social media algorithms that now constantly

193
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,060
hijack our attention.

194
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:16,620
Modern media outlets prey on our evolutionary inclinations for novelty and in-group defense,

195
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:24,780
via capturing our attention and turning clicks and shares into consumption.

196
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:31,020
Computer algorithms optimized for profit are splintering our society by reducing attention

197
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:39,220
spans, accelerating addiction, polarization, apathy, and mistrust in science.

198
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:47,140
A metaphorical technology worm driven by exponentially improving artificial intelligence

199
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:53,500
is silently eating our minds.

200
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,780
Humans are creatures with finite lifespans.

201
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,380
The future is not a priority to us emotionally.

202
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:07,460
Instead, we are focused on the very short term, this weekend's plans, this quarter's

203
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
earnings.

204
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,740
In this term's election, the next set of compelling images were urged to scroll to.

205
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:22,780
We often promise to make big changes starting tomorrow, until tomorrow becomes today, and

206
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:29,420
the cycle repeats delaying any actual change.

207
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:36,900
Like other biological organisms, humans seek gains and are averse to losses.

208
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,340
We look for undervalued stocks to invest in, sales on new shoes, or two-for-one cocktails

209
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,980
at happy hour.

210
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:51,260
Unlike squirrels or cheetahs, we are an extremely social species.

211
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:59,700
We coordinate as families, small businesses, corporations, and nation states to maximize

212
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:07,300
our virtual surplus, dollars, which we then spend on real things.

213
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:16,020
Our core economic and environmental challenges stem from a mismatch of hunter-gatherer minds

214
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,740
inhabiting a competitive consumer growth culture.

215
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:28,980
Together, these human universals have led to incentives and behaviors which have created

216
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:36,620
a metabolic superorganism whose objective is disconnected from the well-being of its

217
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,180
parts, us.

218
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:49,260
It is tempting to look at how we live today and conclude that this is how humans are.

219
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:55,700
But modern society is only a single brief example out of thousands of successful arrangements

220
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,860
in human history.

221
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,100
Humans alive today don't choose to be hierarchical or greedy.

222
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:11,380
Many of our choices are constrained by the economic system we were born into.

223
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:17,700
Our current high consumption, high inequality, high technological distraction, and low levels

224
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:26,180
of daily human connection are a direct product of the carbon pulse.

225
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:32,420
Though human brains don't change quickly under the right circumstances, our behaviors

226
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,300
and cultural norms can move at lightning speed.

227
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:42,420
Our species is incredibly adaptive when we're challenged.

228
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:49,700
The way we've been living is an anomaly, but we take it for granted because as individuals,

229
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:53,540
it's all we've ever known.

230
00:22:53,540 --> 00:23:00,900
Going forward, a lifestyle adapted to lower energy use will reconnect our virtual and

231
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,780
physical worlds.

232
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:10,340
By necessity, our lives will become less global, more interpersonally engaged, and more tethered

233
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,940
to natural flows.

234
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:21,500
As a species, a global superorganism is not our destiny.

235
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,260
Who we are has brought us to this precipice.

236
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:32,660
Who we are capable of becoming as individuals and as a society will be the question of our

237
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,020
time.

238
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,340
We are alive at a time of wonder, peril, and possibility.

239
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,500
Ahead are a million unknown destinations, some dark and foreboding, and some welcoming

240
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,580
and beautiful.

241
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:58,180
Many of us sense that something is different, something is coming, but we lack a shared

242
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:04,780
understanding of the path that brought us here and of the terrain ahead.

243
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:11,660
Each future we expect depends upon which lens we use to see the road.

244
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:18,980
Modern society is polarized, stressed, and overwhelmed with information, good and bad.

245
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:26,260
As a result, common points of view are lenses, focused on the road just in front of us.

246
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:32,140
For the view to the future, we defer to culturally accepted guides who are confident they know

247
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:35,220
the way forward.

248
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,860
Through the lens of an economist, for example, we see a glorious road leading to growth that

249
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,700
never stops.

250
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,620
Any scarcity of energy or material inputs will be solved by price signals, creating incentives

251
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,140
which increase our productivity and growth.

252
00:24:53,140 --> 00:25:01,900
The economic lens shows us that human ingenuity and the market will solve everything.

253
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:09,260
A financial lens translates stock markets at all time highs as a sign of society's health,

254
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:12,740
pretending a rich and virtuous future.

255
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:19,420
With enough financial capital, we'll be able to build roads to anywhere.

256
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:26,060
A technology lens promises a shiny road of comfort, novelty, and prosperity, enabled

257
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,260
by future inventions.

258
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:34,220
Innovation, artificial intelligence, and a vibrant metaverse will sidestep any energy

259
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,580
or resource constraints.

260
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,260
We envision future humans breaking free from the confines of Earth and enjoying high-tech

261
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,580
lifestyles where the biggest problem is runaway robots.

262
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,380
These lenses are all optimistic, but misguided.

263
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,220
All these lenses are energy blind.

264
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:03,220
The real paths ahead can only be seen by integrating energy awareness with biology,

265
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,060
sociology, physics, and everything science has discovered.

266
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:11,980
We need a systems lens to read the map.

267
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:19,100
A systems lens reveals the holistic story that explains humanity's path.

268
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,740
In pursuit of the same emotional experiences of our ancient ancestors, we transform materials

269
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,780
and energy into technologies that make our lives more comfortable and fun.

270
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:37,980
We keep score of our progress using money, which has become a psychological stand-in

271
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,460
for all the things our ancestors valued.

272
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,660
The massive scale of humanity's consumption is evidenced by the excess CO2 being absorbed

273
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,020
by Earth's oceans and atmosphere.

274
00:26:52,020 --> 00:27:00,700
The emergent result is a metabolic superorganism, with oil as its hemoglobin transporting goods

275
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,300
through the arteries and veins of a global supply network.

276
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:11,660
Like a shark needing to swim to get oxygen flowing through its gills, our current economic

277
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:18,540
system has an imperative to grow in order to satisfy prior financial commitments.

278
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,260
We can't stop, nor can we slow down, or the system will crash.

279
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:30,700
A systems lens reveals that the road ahead is closed to our current cultural expectations,

280
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,300
yet we continue to bear down on the accelerator.

281
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:42,460
Wearing systems lenses removes the blind spots created by any single issue lens.

282
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,660
Global economic growth will never meaningfully decouple from energy consumption.

283
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:55,620
It cannot, because the world's GDP, by definition, has always been a proxy for how much energy

284
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,180
we burn.

285
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:03,420
If we were to grow the global economy at 3% a year, as most governments and institutions

286
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:11,100
expect, we would use as much energy and materials in the next 30 years as we have in the past

287
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,540
10,000.

288
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:20,620
Stock markets are poor guideposts for prosperity when inflated by government and central bank

289
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,120
support.

290
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,860
All the cash, stocks, bonds, and pension funds in the world will need energy and materials

291
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,340
to be cashed out and turned into real wealth.

292
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:39,980
Creativity and innovation will be central to human futures, but modern technology requires

293
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,860
huge amounts of energy to build and to operate.

294
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:53,900
As long as GDP is our goal, efficiency gains from new technology will serve the superorganism.

295
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,260
Transitioning from fossil hydrocarbon to rebuildable energy won't change this dynamic.

296
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:08,620
Ultimately, in addition to using different energy, we'll need to use energy differently.

297
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,820
Bringing our future through a systems lens changes everything.

298
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:20,460
We have spent the last century harnessing enormous amounts of fossil energy to build

299
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:25,180
a world of complexity like nothing seen before.

300
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:33,020
In the coming century, humanity will experience a great simplification.

301
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:40,260
There will always be energy on earth as long as the sun burns, but the amount of surplus

302
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:45,420
energy available to human societies will soon be diminished.

303
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:51,040
As the extraction of geologically stored energy becomes more difficult, everything we're

304
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:56,580
used to in society will become more costly or less available.

305
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,220
We are not planning for this because it's never happened before.

306
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:07,180
The onset of the great simplification will be financial and economic turbulence followed

307
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,940
by contraction.

308
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,980
When we can no longer grow fast enough to maintain all the increased financial claims,

309
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:21,340
economies will recede to a scale that can again be supported by physical flows without

310
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,260
credit.

311
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:28,860
Complex global supply chains, the related high consumption lifestyles, and many of

312
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:34,660
the conveniences and freedoms we take for granted in this era of abundant energy surplus

313
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,860
will diminish.

314
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:43,060
The ensuing simplification will be among the most significant events ever experienced

315
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,620
by our species.

316
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:52,260
Those who look through a systems lens can serve as early visionaries of a simpler life with

317
00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:00,620
new ways of relating to technology, to consumption, to each other, and to earth's ecosystems.

318
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,740
There are many pathways wending through a great simplification.

319
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:11,060
Some are wise, humane, and even preferable to what we have now.

320
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:18,940
Some are so dark as to be nearly unthinkable, yet it is precisely thinking about these pathways

321
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:26,140
and actively choosing among them, which offers the only realistic hope for a long and meaningful

322
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,420
human future.

323
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:35,060
Nature has gifted us with a productive and beautiful home, the ability to understand

324
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:42,020
how we got here, and the creativity to imagine which paths are possible.

325
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,500
The future need not be dystopian.

326
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:51,420
But cleverness alone will no longer suffice for the next leg of our journey.

327
00:31:51,420 --> 00:32:00,380
We will need imagination, foresight, empathy, and above all, wisdom to navigate the path

328
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,540
