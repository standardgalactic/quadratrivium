00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
There are so many contingencies, particularly actually on the geopolitical side, that can

00:10.320 --> 00:15.360
derail what seem to be passive development at any one time. And it's a strange...

00:15.360 --> 00:19.040
And this is what I think it's hard to think about, because on the one hand it is systemic,

00:19.040 --> 00:22.320
but on the other hand, it is vulnerable to contingent events.

00:23.040 --> 00:30.080
Today's guest is Professor Helen Thompson. Helen works at Cambridge University, where she

00:30.080 --> 00:36.880
researches the political economy of energy and the long history that underpins the democratic,

00:36.880 --> 00:44.160
economic, and geopolitical disruptions that we are seeing now in the 21st century. Her most

00:44.720 --> 00:52.160
recent book, Disorder, hard times in the 21st century, is kind of a political science

00:53.280 --> 01:01.280
mirror twin of the logic of the great simplification. Today we talk about the history of the United

01:01.280 --> 01:10.240
States in the Middle East, Israel and Hamas and Qatar, Ukraine and Russia, the importance of energy

01:10.240 --> 01:18.160
in the history of the world, and some speculation on what's ahead. Please welcome Professor Helen

01:18.160 --> 01:35.280
Thompson. Hi Helen, great to see you. Hi Nate, good to see you too. Although we've never met in

01:35.280 --> 01:43.440
person, maybe I should call you Professor Thompson. No, call me Helen. So you have an impressive

01:43.440 --> 01:51.440
economic, political, science background covering history, energy, economics, politics, and much

01:51.440 --> 01:57.120
more. Can you just give a brief introduction, and how did you first get interested in these

01:57.120 --> 02:04.640
topics all the way back to college or high school, or what was your path? Not a tour really. I basically

02:05.280 --> 02:18.240
got seriously interested in energy in I think 2013. And I came at it via really the monetary

02:18.240 --> 02:25.840
environment of the post-2008 world. And I was sufficiently, I wouldn't say aware about energy

02:25.840 --> 02:29.760
questions, but I was sufficiently aware of the macroeconomic implications of energy

02:30.720 --> 02:36.560
to understand that there was a relationship between the post-2008 monetary environment,

02:37.120 --> 02:44.400
quantitative easing, zero interest rates, and the shale boom in the US. And to understand that the

02:44.400 --> 02:49.200
world economy needed shale oil, I wouldn't say that my understanding was much better than that

02:49.200 --> 02:58.720
at that point. But I was trying to work out what I might write as a long book project for

02:59.360 --> 03:05.600
academically that turned out not to materialize for various reasons. And I kept thinking, you know

03:05.600 --> 03:09.280
what, I'm going to have to bring oil into this. And I kept trying to work out a way of doing what

03:09.280 --> 03:14.640
I wanted to do about the crash and about the eurozone crisis, and bring oil into it. And then I

03:14.640 --> 03:18.800
realized that was completely the wrong way to think about things and that I just needed to go in like

03:18.800 --> 03:25.520
via oil. So I started trying to think about how I might write a short book by this point about

03:25.520 --> 03:33.040
the macroeconomic consequences of what I now believe to be a serious oil problem for the world

03:33.040 --> 03:38.320
economy. But I quickly understood that in order to think about that, I needed to think about

03:38.320 --> 03:43.920
geopolitics in a way which I'd never really done before, not in any sharply incisive way anyway.

03:43.920 --> 03:51.840
So I try to teach myself to think geopolitically around this time as well. And things have really

03:51.840 --> 03:57.600
moved from there. I mean, the only thing I would add to that is I'm a child of the 70s. I was born

03:57.600 --> 04:08.160
in 1967 in Britain. My first memory of national life in Britain is the winter of 1974, sitting around

04:08.720 --> 04:15.920
at home, seven years old, my mother trying to cook in the dark evening after evening,

04:15.920 --> 04:23.200
with two small children, candlelight. So I understood in a quite visual sense in a way

04:23.200 --> 04:29.280
that energy had a profound impact or could have a profound impact on daily life. And I never lost

04:29.280 --> 04:35.360
that. But I wouldn't say that until some point after 2013, I connected that in any way to what I

04:35.360 --> 04:40.240
was trying to do as a scholar. I have a ton of questions for you, as you might imagine. Could

04:40.240 --> 04:47.760
you give a one or two minute elevator pitch of your latest book Disorder Hard Times in the 21st

04:47.760 --> 04:55.600
century? So what I really wanted to do in Disorder was try to explain the political shocks of the

04:55.600 --> 05:00.320
2010s, with which people obviously were very familiar, not least in Britain and the United

05:00.320 --> 05:05.200
States, because high on the list of shocks of that year were obviously Brexit, or were seen to be

05:05.200 --> 05:13.200
anyway, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and to give them a long history. And I didn't think

05:13.200 --> 05:18.880
that they were just episodes, if you like, of psychodrama in British politics or American

05:19.520 --> 05:25.440
politics. I thought that each of those two things had more of a structural explanation than that.

05:26.480 --> 05:33.840
And I wanted to run with the thought that actually, if I started thinking seriously

05:33.840 --> 05:39.840
and systematically about these events having an energy history, that I will be able to get

05:39.840 --> 05:45.920
somewhere in explaining them that more conventional accounts wouldn't. Now, I'm not enough of an energy

05:45.920 --> 05:50.560
determinist where politics is concerned to think that energy explains absolutely everything. And

05:50.560 --> 05:55.200
indeed, if I had thought that I probably wouldn't have spent time in the third part of Disorder,

05:55.200 --> 06:00.240
writing about democracies quite in the way in which I do. But I wanted also to grapple with

06:00.240 --> 06:06.480
what I see as the longstanding historical problems that representative democracy faces

06:06.480 --> 06:11.040
as a form of government. And I thought there were some things, particularly actually in relation to

06:11.040 --> 06:18.880
the United States and its history as a domestic oil producer, where it was possible to say that

06:18.880 --> 06:24.400
there was a story to be told about the American Republic and what was going on in oil politics

06:24.400 --> 06:33.440
as well. So my book kind of tries to say, look, we should have expected the disorder of the 2010s

06:33.440 --> 06:39.040
because there were these significant structural forces at work centered around not only the

06:39.040 --> 06:43.360
problems of fossil fuel energy, but the difficulties of the energy transition, the geopolitics of the

06:43.360 --> 06:47.760
energy transition. And then unless we could understand those things, we won't get really

06:47.760 --> 06:52.160
anywhere in understanding the economic, political and geopolitical world in which we live.

06:53.120 --> 07:00.000
So I'm glad we're finally having a conversation on camera. My work, as you know,

07:00.000 --> 07:07.280
focuses around the concept of energy blindness in finance, in economic theory, and in broader

07:07.280 --> 07:14.720
culture. And it's always refreshing to talk to someone who sees not energy as everything,

07:14.720 --> 07:22.480
but energy in everything like I do in a different field. So you're a political scientist and a

07:22.480 --> 07:30.560
political economist in your academic stripes. Are your fields political science? Is that

07:30.560 --> 07:38.160
energy blind as well? And is that changing? I'd say that political science is energy blind largely.

07:38.800 --> 07:46.960
I'd say that political economy has a more complicated relationship to this. I think

07:46.960 --> 07:52.640
if you go back to the 1970s and the political economy that came out of the 1970s, indeed,

07:52.640 --> 07:59.200
some of the stuff that, say, I was taught as an undergraduate, I don't think it was energy blind.

07:59.200 --> 08:05.280
I think that political economy was relatively energy aware, not necessarily in the

08:06.160 --> 08:12.400
system dynamics of energy, but the economic and geopolitical importance of energy.

08:12.400 --> 08:18.320
And then it lost that awareness. I think it kind of lost the awareness at the same time in a way

08:18.320 --> 08:24.560
in which the politicians in Western countries lost their awareness. So sometime, and I struggle

08:24.560 --> 08:30.320
sometimes to think, to know where I think this began, it was the late 80s or sometime in the

08:30.320 --> 08:37.920
90s when I think then an energy blindness took over. I think in political economy over the last

08:38.560 --> 08:46.400
few years, there is quite a bit of evidence that actually at least some people are getting serious

08:46.400 --> 08:54.240
about energy again. And I've had a lot less difficulty explaining to people since my book,

08:54.240 --> 09:00.960
this book came out, this longer book Disorder, why energy is as important as I'm presenting it to

09:00.960 --> 09:07.520
be. When I wrote this short book called Oil on the Western Economic Crisis, which came out in 2017,

09:08.080 --> 09:12.080
then I still think most people thought, why is she writing about that?

09:13.280 --> 09:20.080
Well, it didn't hurt the tailwinds for your book that it came out the exact same time that Putin

09:20.080 --> 09:26.560
invaded Ukraine. No, I mean, in the UK, it came out on the actual day of the invasion.

09:26.560 --> 09:34.320
Oh my gosh. So that was a strange experience in itself. But there were things that I was saying

09:34.320 --> 09:39.040
that suddenly people who weren't particularly interested in energy and I think didn't think

09:39.040 --> 09:42.880
they wanted to be interested in energy suddenly would tell me that they were reading it and they

09:42.880 --> 09:48.240
would say, oh, that makes sense. And I give you one clear example of that was what I wrote about

09:48.240 --> 09:52.960
the Suez Crisis. And I spent a lot of time thinking about the Suez Crisis trying to offer a somewhat

09:52.960 --> 09:59.920
different interpretation than certainly we usually get in Britain. And I remember when I was writing

09:59.920 --> 10:04.560
that chapter, and I just took the decision one day that I was actually going to make it the structural

10:04.560 --> 10:10.080
pivot of the second geopolitical chapter. And I thought this could go very wrong. I mean, people

10:10.080 --> 10:14.880
would just think that it's some kind of apology for British imperialism. And then because of what

10:14.880 --> 10:19.840
was happening with Ukraine and the pipelines and the issue of transit and these big shifts,

10:20.880 --> 10:26.240
then almost everybody who was asking me questions in the first few weeks after the book came out

10:26.240 --> 10:31.680
in the UK wanted to talk to me about the Suez Crisis. I'm going to jump around a bit, Helen,

10:31.680 --> 10:39.280
but since you brought that up, could you briefly describe the Suez Crisis and speculate on whether

10:39.280 --> 10:46.320
we're going to have another one? Yeah, I mean, the second part of that's a really very interesting

10:47.200 --> 10:53.600
question. I think that what's important to see from the British point of view, which I'll start with,

10:53.600 --> 11:02.640
on the Suez Crisis, is that in 1956, when the British took military action with France and Israel

11:02.720 --> 11:11.920
against Egypt in the light of NASA and the Egyptian president nationalising the company that owned

11:12.640 --> 11:19.760
Suez Canal, in the British government mine, the British were doing exactly what they were supposed

11:19.760 --> 11:26.480
to do in the post-second world war, which was to act as an imperial power in the Middle East

11:26.480 --> 11:32.400
to guarantee the oil security of Western European countries. Because American presidents were very

11:32.400 --> 11:38.560
clear in the post-war second world war world, they wanted largely the oil of the Western hemisphere

11:38.560 --> 11:43.760
for the Western hemisphere, obviously not least the United States itself. They were only willing to

11:43.760 --> 11:50.640
provide oil to Western Europe countries in an emergency. They didn't really want Western European

11:50.640 --> 11:55.120
countries buying oil from the Soviet Union, certainly once the Cold War got going, that

11:55.120 --> 12:01.040
meant Western European countries and Japan needed to import oil from the Middle East and they didn't

12:01.040 --> 12:06.240
want to have any military responsibility in the Middle East for ensuring the free flow of oil

12:06.240 --> 12:11.520
through the Persian Gulf. That was the British job. Obviously they didn't want the British

12:11.520 --> 12:17.520
behaving in brazen ways like an imperial power that made it very difficult for them with Arab

12:17.520 --> 12:22.560
states, but nonetheless, if there was a threat to Western European energy security, then Britain

12:22.560 --> 12:27.120
was supposed to act as an imperial power and do something about it, which is what British did in

12:28.000 --> 12:34.640
the autumn of 1956 and then Eisenhower obviously up for re-election didn't want that kind of display

12:34.640 --> 12:41.520
of European imperialism, particularly at a time when the Soviet Union was sending tanks into

12:42.240 --> 12:50.160
Budapest and put such financial pressure on the British government, financial pressure that was

12:50.160 --> 12:56.720
made possible by Britain's desperate need now to find dollars to buy American oil because

12:57.920 --> 13:03.680
the Arab states were boycotting the sale of oil through one of the pipelines and the Suez canal

13:03.680 --> 13:09.520
was closed, that it was very easy for Eisenhower to tell the British Prime Minister Antony Eden,

13:10.320 --> 13:14.480
you're out. With the British not being able to continue neither could the French and neither

13:14.480 --> 13:19.120
ultimately could the Israelis. If we just look at it for a moment from the Israeli

13:20.000 --> 13:27.920
point of view, what that showed in 1956 was how vulnerable that they were on transit issues

13:27.920 --> 13:32.960
and that was both about the Suez canal itself, but it was also about the Strait of Turan,

13:32.960 --> 13:40.720
which is like water that gets them up the eastern side of the Sinai Peninsula and made

13:40.720 --> 13:48.480
it possible, would make it possible in time for Iran to sell oil to Israel and that became

13:48.480 --> 13:56.800
a really central issue for Israel, including then in 1967 when NASA closed the Strait of Turan

13:56.800 --> 14:03.600
again and then kept the Suez canal closed for eight years, the second time.

14:03.600 --> 14:07.120
So what happened then during those eight years, the ships had to go all the way around?

14:07.920 --> 14:15.280
Yeah, I mean if it wasn't coming pipeline, it has to go all the way around Africa and

14:15.280 --> 14:21.360
interestingly in that context that is part of the reason then why from 1967 the British

14:21.360 --> 14:25.600
government concludes it can no longer stay in the Middle East, it can no longer carry on being an

14:25.600 --> 14:32.400
imperial power there because suddenly the the oil costs that Britain faces in the wake of the

14:32.400 --> 14:36.960
Six Day War where it's also subject to a embargo, a much greater.

14:37.680 --> 14:44.880
So in addition to culture being energy blind, it's possible that energy experts and

14:44.880 --> 14:52.560
culture are geopolitics and complexity blind. I mean can you imagine, I'm sure you can,

14:53.280 --> 15:00.320
you're an expert on this, the importance of the Suez canal and the Strait of Hormuz as being open

15:00.320 --> 15:09.120
and free and navigable for the rest of the world just in time things and both of those are within

15:09.120 --> 15:16.320
the arena of the current conflict. I think most people don't even think about those important

15:16.320 --> 15:23.440
choke points. No, I mean obviously this raises the second part of your question. I mean if we

15:23.440 --> 15:28.240
look at Israel's position in this though, there's been a really quite substantial change

15:28.960 --> 15:36.240
from the situation either in 1956 for Israel or in 1967. So in the aftermath of the Suez

15:37.200 --> 15:46.480
crisis through to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, then Iran was the principal exporter of oil

15:46.480 --> 15:52.880
to Israel. None of the Arab states were willing to sell oil to Israel. The United States was

15:52.880 --> 16:01.760
operating with its not exports accepting an emergency. So the only state really that was

16:01.840 --> 16:14.160
willing to sell oil to Israel on a contracted basis was with the Iranians. And that was one of

16:14.160 --> 16:21.600
the reasons why in 1967 that NASA blockaded the Straits of Tehran because he wanted to stop

16:22.240 --> 16:27.040
Iran selling oil to Israel. He thought that that was a fundamental weakness of the Islamic world

16:27.040 --> 16:37.760
in dealing with Israel back in 1967. But then when we get to the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution,

16:37.760 --> 16:44.560
although that there's some covert selling of oil by Iran to Israel, this time like through a land

16:45.360 --> 16:53.280
pipeline rather than through the Straits of Tehran, Israel starts looking for other options.

16:53.280 --> 16:59.040
It gets a guarantee from the Americans that in an absolute emergency the Americans will provide

16:59.040 --> 17:06.080
oil. But if we look at who is the number one exporter of oil to Israel today, it's Azerbaijan.

17:07.360 --> 17:13.360
It comes via like pipeline that the vulnerability for Israel in that is actually Turkey's position

17:13.360 --> 17:19.360
because the pipeline's coming through Turkey. In terms of the relationship between the Israeli

17:19.360 --> 17:23.120
government and the Azerbaijani government, it's quite strong. Israel's also selling arms

17:24.000 --> 17:29.040
to Azerbaijan. But it's the transit. It's the transit through Turkey that is probably on that

17:29.040 --> 17:39.440
respect, Israel's vulnerability. So let's put a pin in that. 1979 was a key year in the Middle

17:39.440 --> 17:46.160
East because Egypt recognized Israel. The Shah of Iran was overthrown. Israel gave up its oil

17:46.640 --> 17:54.720
in Sinai as a part of developing better relations with Egypt. And the Iranian Revolution then cut

17:54.720 --> 18:00.640
off Israel from oil supply that the Shah had provided, as you mentioned. So you've observed

18:00.640 --> 18:07.600
that these events made the USSR somewhat irrelevant in that part of the world until the

18:08.320 --> 18:14.800
Syrian civil war 30 years later, 40 years later. Is there a parallel between the Abraham Accords

18:16.640 --> 18:24.080
in which Saudi Arabia was poised to join the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco in normalizing relations with

18:24.080 --> 18:30.960
Israel earlier this year? And Iran now feeling potentially less relevant in the Middle East

18:30.960 --> 18:38.000
in the same way Russia became after 1979? I think there are possibly some parallels here.

18:38.320 --> 18:45.440
I think that there's, well, I think that there's a paradox, which I don't still think I really

18:45.440 --> 18:50.720
have got to grips with in trying to understand the events of the last few weeks. Because if we

18:50.720 --> 18:57.440
think about the course of the last few years, in particularly actually the first part of this year,

18:58.000 --> 19:03.440
we could see two different things, at least two different things, really opposite things going

19:03.440 --> 19:09.280
on. The first of them, as you said, Nate, was the possibility, the strong possibility it would seem

19:10.400 --> 19:16.160
that the Abraham Accords were going to be extended to Saudi Arabia. And at that point,

19:16.160 --> 19:24.240
you could see that actually not only was Israel going to be able to normalize relations with a

19:24.240 --> 19:29.280
growing number of Arab states, including now the most significant one, but that that was quite

19:29.360 --> 19:35.600
complementary to various of the economic relations, including energy relations that Israel was

19:35.600 --> 19:42.560
cultivating with Arab states, not least being able to do so, because since some point in the 2010s,

19:42.560 --> 19:49.120
Israel has been able to export, I think it's from 2017, has been able to export gas from its offshore

19:49.920 --> 19:58.960
eastern Mediterranean gas fields, and two of the states that it exports to have been Jordan

19:58.960 --> 20:06.240
and Egypt. You've also got UAE involvement in at least one of those gas fields. So you could see

20:06.240 --> 20:11.680
that there was a kind of, not economic unity would be going too far, but economic interdependence

20:11.680 --> 20:18.560
growing between Israel and various of the Arab states takes Saudi Arabia into that. That is a

20:18.640 --> 20:25.360
big deal, a really big deal. And in one sense transformative, I think, from Israel's point of

20:25.360 --> 20:33.280
view. And then you might say, well, Iran shut out of that, no possibility of that kind of

20:33.280 --> 20:39.520
relationship between Israel and Iran tries to sabotage it, though that runs into the issue of

20:39.520 --> 20:44.080
whether they really did know that Hamas was going to attack. But on the other hand, if you look

20:44.160 --> 20:48.320
up to what was going on this year, is you had the rapprochement, the diplomatic rapprochement

20:48.320 --> 20:55.520
between Saudi Arabia and Iran, brokered it would seem on the surface anyway, by the Chinese,

20:55.520 --> 21:01.920
perhaps United Arab Emirates played some part, perhaps Putin played some part. So actually,

21:01.920 --> 21:10.560
you had growing Saudi, apparently anyway, growing Saudi Iranian relations or defrosting, let's say,

21:10.560 --> 21:15.680
relations during the same period in which Iran might not like it's been left out of the Abraham

21:15.680 --> 21:21.200
Accords. And I still think trying to understand how both those things were going on at the same

21:21.200 --> 21:29.440
time, I still think that's a bit of a puzzle. Is it possible? I am absolutely no expert here,

21:29.440 --> 21:38.000
which is why I'm asking you. But there has been obviously tribal conflicts in humanity back to

21:38.000 --> 21:45.520
the Pleistocene. But a big one is between the Shia and Sunni factions of the Muslim

21:45.520 --> 21:53.760
faith. Is it possible that the aversion to the West, the United States, Israel,

21:55.360 --> 22:04.320
is enough an aversion that it could unite some of the previous antagonistic tribes in the area?

22:04.320 --> 22:09.840
And it could be Middle East, Asia versus the West from this current conflict. Do you have

22:09.840 --> 22:21.920
any thoughts on that? I think that that is quite hard to imagine or at least not to see that the

22:22.720 --> 22:30.560
fault lines would assert themselves quite quickly. I mean, I give you one like example,

22:30.560 --> 22:38.880
is the complete difficulty that the Bush administration had persuading the Saudis that

22:38.880 --> 22:46.560
they had to make some kind of accommodation with post Saddam's Iraq, once the Shia majority were

22:46.560 --> 22:55.680
the dominant political force in Iraq. And in that sense, it was easier for the Saudis to have,

22:56.640 --> 23:00.000
I wouldn't say necessarily straightforwardly positive relations with the United States,

23:00.000 --> 23:05.520
but at least complicated relations with the United States that had some payoff potentially for each

23:05.520 --> 23:15.280
side, then it was to reestablish Iraq-Saudi relations in the post Saddam era. I think as well

23:15.280 --> 23:24.960
that if you look at the internal politics of a number of Arab countries, including now like

23:25.360 --> 23:34.480
Egypt as well, the idea that they really want to make common cause with Hamas, both in its

23:34.480 --> 23:40.480
relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood, who obviously were in power in Egypt from 2011-2013,

23:40.480 --> 23:49.280
but also then around support for Hamas, that's I think pretty destabilizing prospect in Egyptian

23:50.080 --> 23:55.760
politics. So I think we always have got a factor into this, like what the risks around domestic

23:55.760 --> 24:03.120
political stability are for any of the Arab states in their relations, not only with Iran,

24:03.120 --> 24:12.640
but also with the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian cause is obviously prominent in

24:12.720 --> 24:20.560
everyday news right now. This is recorded on Monday, October 30th. Obvious to those people that

24:20.560 --> 24:28.400
understand the centrality of energy to our world, the effects of the Israel Hamas situation have

24:28.400 --> 24:35.360
clear consequences for the availability of oil globally, something like half to two thirds of

24:35.360 --> 24:43.840
the world's oil reserves are within 800 miles of Israel. But how is this conflict taken a bird's

24:43.840 --> 24:51.760
eye view, especially during the late 20th century? How is the energy at the center of this

24:52.720 --> 24:57.840
current conflict? Can you give a stratospheric view of that?

24:58.400 --> 25:09.600
Well, I think there are several different things going on here. The first of them is that

25:11.440 --> 25:16.960
Iran's position in the Persian Gulf, and to some extent its relationship with China

25:17.920 --> 25:28.400
around the Persian Gulf are pretty central to any question about the conflict between Israel

25:28.400 --> 25:36.400
and Hamas, spelling out into an original conflict or original war. And I think that there's a way

25:36.400 --> 25:43.360
of thinking about that question that actually goes back to the summer of 2019, which is actually

25:43.440 --> 25:53.040
where I started disorder. Because there we saw what happened when Iran responded to what Trump

25:53.040 --> 25:59.440
called the maximum economic pressure being applied after Trump had entered the Iran nuclear deal with

25:59.440 --> 26:06.560
various attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf. Then there was the attacks probably by Iranian

26:06.640 --> 26:13.680
proxies on the Saudi oil facilities, Saudi defense system essentially failed.

26:15.440 --> 26:20.080
And then it looked like the Americans, even under Trump, weren't going to make any response to that,

26:20.080 --> 26:25.360
which made the Saudis incredibly angry. And then in January of 2020, so just as the pandemic was

26:25.360 --> 26:32.720
starting in China, we had Trump ordering the assassination of Soleimani, the head of the Iranian

26:32.720 --> 26:38.640
Revolutionary Guard. And the response of a lot of Trump's critics to that was he's so mad, he's

26:38.640 --> 26:46.000
just about to start like World War Three. So even in the quite recent years with pandemic got in

26:46.000 --> 26:52.000
the way of people, I think remembering what was going on in the second half of 2019 and early 2020,

26:52.560 --> 26:59.120
we can see that conflict in the Persian Gulf has got the potential to be incredibly destabilizing.

27:00.080 --> 27:07.600
And so any, for any conflict that moves into regional war in the Middle East, that is

27:08.560 --> 27:15.680
will be central to it. How are we going to avoid a major war in the Middle East?

27:18.160 --> 27:24.640
I mean, what would be the, I think you don't need to paint the worst case. Worst case is

27:24.960 --> 27:31.840
nukes all around the world. You don't even need to paint the bad case, which is the Strait of

27:31.840 --> 27:40.880
Hormuz closes and there's giant bombs and destruction in Middle Eastern countries. What

27:40.880 --> 27:46.400
would be a somewhat benign and a hopeful outcome of the current situation?

27:47.360 --> 27:54.960
I think the benign version is that the presence of the American Navy in the way in which it is

27:54.960 --> 28:04.640
now in the Mediterranean is sufficient deterrent to Iran to ensure that Hezbollah stays out of

28:04.640 --> 28:12.240
anything, doing anything particularly significant in northern Israel. And Iran understood stands

28:12.320 --> 28:21.920
that there would be very direct consequences for it if it were to engage in, even in maybe even

28:21.920 --> 28:28.640
the kind of action that it engaged in the summer of 2019 in the Strait of Hormuz.

28:30.480 --> 28:36.880
A lot of times when there's, and here's me saying this to a political scientist expert,

28:37.440 --> 28:43.680
it seems like there's a conflict between a country and another country. But here it's like this

28:44.640 --> 28:51.360
complicated rat's nest of multiple countries and multiple groups and demographics and

28:51.360 --> 28:57.200
initiatives. I mean, there's Lebanon, there's Syria, there's Russian support there, there's Iran,

28:57.200 --> 29:04.320
there's Hezbollah, there's Hamas, there's all kinds of Houthi rebels. And it seems like there are

29:04.400 --> 29:07.760
tiny little Archduke Ferdinand possibilities everywhere.

29:08.720 --> 29:19.920
No, absolutely. But I think some of that, though, there's a positive story to tell about some of

29:19.920 --> 29:28.480
the complexities of the interdependence. For instance, as I said earlier, Israel exports

29:28.480 --> 29:35.200
gas now, at least it has been to Jordan and to Egypt. That means that these are countries that

29:35.200 --> 29:45.280
have got something to lose from conflict with Israel in a way which has never historically

29:45.280 --> 29:54.000
been true before the 2010s when this offshore Israeli gas production began. Now, there is some

29:54.000 --> 29:57.680
difficulty for Egypt coming out of this. And unfortunately, it does have, I think, potential

29:57.680 --> 30:05.200
ramifications for Europe, because one of the fields, the three main fields in the Eastern

30:05.200 --> 30:13.920
Mediterranean that belong to Israel, Tamar is in the rocket range of Hamas. And so production is

30:13.920 --> 30:18.880
shut down at the moment, which means that Egypt isn't getting the liquid natural gas exports

30:18.880 --> 30:23.280
from Israel that it would usually do. It also exports itself because it has fields in the

30:23.280 --> 30:28.640
Eastern Mediterranean. That means you'll be exporting less to Europe. And we know that European

30:28.640 --> 30:33.200
demand for liquid natural gas is much higher than it was two years ago because of Russia's

30:33.200 --> 30:38.400
war against Ukraine. And so these things become interconnected and disruptive.

30:39.200 --> 30:49.920
So I'm an American and I remember what happened with President Bush and the war in Iraq.

30:50.160 --> 30:57.920
And I have other memories of subsequent presidents. Can you outline the shifting

30:57.920 --> 31:03.120
relationships and perspectives with the United States president's administrations

31:03.920 --> 31:11.200
towards Saudi Arabia and the Middle East from Obama to Trump to currently Biden with the

31:11.200 --> 31:17.920
fist bump to MBS or he refused to shake hands? But it seems like this is all an unfolding soap

31:17.920 --> 31:23.440
opera with massive consequences for our future. Yeah, I think you'd probably need to just start

31:23.440 --> 31:32.480
with like where things were in the Bush Jr presidency. Let's say particularly by 2005.

31:33.200 --> 31:44.480
So once it's clear that Iraq is going to be a quagmire at best and that if a crucial purpose

31:44.480 --> 31:53.680
which to my mind it was of the Iraq war was to remove the sanctions from Iraq's oil exports,

31:53.680 --> 32:01.680
rebuild the Iraqi oil industry, get international oil companies back into Iraq, turn Iraq into

32:03.680 --> 32:09.760
a large-scale oil producer rather than as it had previously been before the sanctions a medium-sized

32:09.760 --> 32:16.320
oil producer. So producing more like 10 or 11 million barrels a day like the Saudis could.

32:16.960 --> 32:22.640
That wasn't going to work out. It's very clear by 2005. So what we see in 2005 and I think that

32:22.640 --> 32:30.480
the shapes of a world that we still live in is essentially that world oil production stagnated.

32:31.760 --> 32:38.800
And then into that in the 2010s came the shale oil boom in the United States and meant that

32:38.880 --> 32:44.880
that stagnation of production that was there I think by 2005 and it was for a whole set of reasons

32:45.920 --> 32:52.080
including geopolitical reasons didn't play out in the way in which it would have done otherwise.

32:52.080 --> 32:58.000
So there was no way that George Bush could find a way out of the Middle East or even think that he

32:58.000 --> 33:03.760
could find a way out of the Middle East. I think the Iraq war should be understood as trying to

33:03.760 --> 33:10.880
address what that administration understood really quite well was the stagnation of production that

33:10.880 --> 33:16.000
was coming in a world in which Asian demand in general and Chinese in particular was growing

33:16.000 --> 33:25.040
quite rapidly. I think by the time that Obama has been in office a couple of years by 2011 probably

33:25.760 --> 33:31.360
the people in the White House with him buy this idea that shale is the fix.

33:32.480 --> 33:40.080
Now shale is a partial fix. It stops I think economically the 2010s being a lot more difficult

33:40.080 --> 33:45.920
than they would otherwise have been but it isn't actually a route out of the United States from

33:45.920 --> 33:51.680
the Middle East altogether. Not least because it's the question of like where the shale oil is

33:51.680 --> 33:57.280
going to be refined and where the American refineries are themselves well suited to all the shale that's

33:57.280 --> 34:03.920
being produced. So the United States isn't actually losing its need to import oil from the Middle

34:03.920 --> 34:09.040
East. It's simply reducing its need to import oil from the Middle East but I think the Obama

34:09.040 --> 34:15.360
administration is emboldened by shale. I think it does several things. It first of all thinks okay

34:15.360 --> 34:20.560
we can now sanction Iran which they've been quite wary about because the Europeans will protest

34:20.560 --> 34:26.000
the oil prices will go too high if too much Iranian oil is taken off the market. We sanction them,

34:26.000 --> 34:31.600
we bring them to the table, we get a nuclear deal with Iran. The sanctions can come off,

34:31.600 --> 34:37.680
we can normalize relations, largely normalize relations like with Iran. That will put the

34:37.680 --> 34:42.880
Saudis in their place a bit too. We don't have to treat them so seriously as we've

34:43.840 --> 34:49.840
as we've generally been doing since the 1970s because we don't need them so much

34:50.400 --> 34:54.880
and obviously it doesn't turn out like that in terms of getting out of the Middle East not least

34:54.880 --> 35:00.880
because ISIS comes along and then he's got American troops out of Iraq by 2012 but the

35:00.880 --> 35:09.600
Air Force is going back in in 2014. Now Trump I think then comes in the exact opposite way of

35:10.160 --> 35:15.360
well let's I use Trump as a shorthand because who knows who exactly was making all the decisions in

35:15.360 --> 35:22.640
the Trump White House but comes in and he is like no we need to be close to the Saudis still

35:22.640 --> 35:31.360
we need to be tough on Iran and so he's willing to be quite tolerant of most things to do with

35:31.360 --> 35:39.040
MBS cultivates personal relationship probably get some payoff in terms of his own corporate

35:39.040 --> 35:47.120
material interfamily interests but I think it's quite then revealing that even when Trump is

35:47.120 --> 35:54.160
the president in the September of 2019 when those Saudi oil facilities are attacked that

35:54.160 --> 36:03.760
the Americans don't actually make a response. I think Biden comes in then and he's back to

36:03.760 --> 36:11.120
flipping it the other way and he's got an added component to it which is that he I think quite

36:11.120 --> 36:17.760
desperately wants the Iran nuclear deal back because he wants Iranian more Iranian oil on the

36:17.760 --> 36:23.120
world markets because he doesn't want to look like he's got an oil policy at all he wants his energy

36:23.120 --> 36:31.120
policy to look like it's just about climate and the energy transition so Iran nuclear deal you

36:31.120 --> 36:36.880
have to know something to understand that that's it oil policy but he's not able to but in that case

36:38.800 --> 36:48.320
you just made the supposition that Biden cares more about appearing to be a climate president

36:48.320 --> 36:58.480
rather than actually being one because he wants the US to use less oil but if more Iranian oil

36:58.560 --> 37:04.160
is on the world market from a CO2 perspective that's more fossil carbon being burned right?

37:06.000 --> 37:13.600
Yeah I mean I think there obviously are like levels of like complexity to that I mean you

37:13.600 --> 37:22.560
might also say I mean you know I don't suppose to know how much deep thinking there has been

37:22.560 --> 37:29.520
about this question inside the Biden White House you might also say that it's quite useful if you

37:29.520 --> 37:37.600
really understand that might be a medium to long-term oil problem that actually you keep some American

37:37.600 --> 37:44.160
production like back and let others like take this case so there's level draining America first

37:46.160 --> 37:49.840
absolutely I don't think that's the deep thinking but maybe maybe it is

37:50.720 --> 37:59.920
but what we know whatever thinking was going on the policy didn't work and so already by the summer

37:59.920 --> 38:11.520
of 2021 he was having to ask the Saudis essentially to increase output which they weren't willing to do

38:11.520 --> 38:22.800
he then made is rather humiliating visit to Riyadh in the next summer in 2022 and the Saudis

38:22.800 --> 38:30.560
have shown no willingness really despite the fact of working with the administration about the Abraham

38:30.560 --> 38:39.120
accords to accommodate the Biden administration's persistent desire for more oil output from OPEC

38:39.120 --> 38:49.200
plus so what do you think about the fact that if you add UAE Saudi Arabia and the new BRICS

38:49.200 --> 38:58.400
nations including Russia that the amount of oil purchasable in the open market not the oil

38:58.400 --> 39:06.800
production but the available oil exports are now over 50 percent controlled by BRICS nations

39:07.440 --> 39:17.440
first of all is that important and a related question I'm just curious from a political

39:17.440 --> 39:26.400
perspective people living in those nations in the Middle East that are selling the stored sunlight

39:26.400 --> 39:35.040
from beneath their lands to the global west and of course they're getting dollars or financial

39:35.600 --> 39:44.080
remuneration for that but it's their legacy of what they have in their lands and it's being

39:44.080 --> 39:50.880
sold to the west do the people there ever get patriotic and nationalistic about that I mean

39:50.880 --> 39:56.240
what is the real feeling beneath the dollar signs and barrels of oil that are flowing

39:56.240 --> 40:05.680
I mean on the first question I think that OPEC plus matters a lot more than the BRICS

40:05.680 --> 40:14.800
okay I mean I think if you look at it in energy terms that India and China and and Brazil as

40:14.800 --> 40:25.040
founders are in a very different position than Russia and I think that China has its own really

40:25.040 --> 40:34.960
quite severe still constraints around its foreign oil and gas dependency and I think it's well aware

40:34.960 --> 40:44.480
of those I think in this case the Chinese leadership really is energy aware yeah so I think that in

40:44.480 --> 40:53.520
terms of is there a power block that would use energy as a weapon against western countries we

40:53.520 --> 41:01.280
should think in terms of like OPEC plus and not think in terms of BRICS okay and I think you might

41:01.280 --> 41:08.400
say that it then really is quite significant that the Saudi Russian axis in OPEC plus has held

41:08.400 --> 41:14.880
through Russia's invasion of Ukraine indeed strengthened because if you go back to the

41:15.840 --> 41:20.480
aftermath of those attacks on the Saudi oil facilities you pretty much had Putin laughing

41:20.480 --> 41:25.200
at the Saudis about the fact that the air defense system that they bought from the United States

41:25.200 --> 41:35.920
didn't work if you go to the spring of 2020 so when the pandemic really started you have been

41:35.920 --> 41:41.600
salmon trying to flood the market with oil after you can't reach an agreement with Putin about how

41:41.600 --> 41:47.680
to deal with the pandemic and then you effectively have Donald Trump putting OPEC plus back together

41:47.680 --> 41:53.760
again because he doesn't want the price of oil on the floor for American shale producers and having

41:53.760 --> 42:00.000
to threaten the Saudis like with military withdrawal or you know military less military support unless

42:00.000 --> 42:08.880
that they play nice with him about that so I mean OPEC plus looks pretty like weak as any kind of

42:08.960 --> 42:17.760
cohesive block in the spring of 2020 we're a long way away from that now OPEC plus can choose to

42:17.760 --> 42:24.000
inflict harm on the Biden administration and I think chose to do so in the run up to those mid-term

42:24.000 --> 42:32.320
elections last November when a quite substantial cut was announced just in the weeks before when

42:32.320 --> 42:38.800
Biden had been pressing obviously for increased output. I was going to ask you this near the end

42:38.800 --> 42:46.240
of the interview but I'll ask it right now given what you just said have we reached the point

42:46.240 --> 42:53.280
or are we approaching a point where the rest of the world can decouple or de facto sanction the

42:53.280 --> 43:01.280
US and other countries in the US orbit without it having disastrous effects on their own economies?

43:02.320 --> 43:12.960
I think you can see that in Russia's case that it has been able to inflict quite substantial harm

43:12.960 --> 43:21.600
on European countries and in particular Germany by cutting off the supply of gas through the

43:21.600 --> 43:28.480
Nord Stream 1 pipeline which just began to do from the summer of 2022 if you look at the economic

43:28.480 --> 43:35.920
data coming out of Germany over the last few months it's pretty difficult that Germany has

43:35.920 --> 43:44.560
experienced a major industrial blow by what has happened and it's not clear that the Russian economy

43:45.200 --> 43:53.040
has taken such a big hit for having done this certainly where oil is concerned it's been able

43:53.040 --> 43:58.640
to sell pretty much the same amount of oil as it was previously doing for a reasonably long

43:58.640 --> 44:05.200
period of time at a lower price than the market price but even that it's not clear that that's true

44:06.400 --> 44:13.840
any longer it's been able to increase its liquid natural gas exports it obviously doesn't yet

44:13.840 --> 44:20.640
compensate from those for what it's lost through selling through the the pipelines that the Yamaha

44:20.640 --> 44:26.080
pipeline and the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to European countries but it's got the capacity

44:26.960 --> 44:35.120
to increase LNG exports further I think the Saudi question is like more difficult because the

44:35.120 --> 44:40.720
Saudis are obviously more integrated financially into the US world and the way that the Russians

44:40.720 --> 44:46.000
were much less so since even just then since 2014 and certainly since those financial

44:46.960 --> 44:52.960
sanctions and Saudi obviously has this does have a military relationship with the United States and

44:52.960 --> 44:59.600
so that acts as some kind of constraint on what the Saudis can do too so it was three weeks ago

44:59.600 --> 45:11.040
just over when the Hamas-Israel situation exploded and at that time I thought that the

45:12.000 --> 45:22.960
implications would be a premium on long dated oil futures and instability to the financial system

45:24.240 --> 45:31.200
and instead oil as of today three weeks later is about at the same level it was before that

45:31.200 --> 45:40.080
happened maybe because you say the US Navy is suppressing volatility but I was surprised and

45:40.080 --> 45:47.120
I don't like to talk about this much because you can get in in social trouble really easily but

45:47.120 --> 45:53.840
since you're a professional in this domain it almost feels like this entire situation

45:53.840 --> 46:01.920
unexpectedly to me and many people is like a Middle East version of a George Floyd moment

46:02.880 --> 46:11.920
where there are people around the world reacting to what's happening and it it it seems like that

46:11.920 --> 46:19.680
puts the international social contract of agreements and supply chains and geopolitical

46:19.680 --> 46:30.160
alliances and everything that we kind of assumed would continue before October 2023 might might

46:30.160 --> 46:37.680
change just because of this you know this this zeitgeist is is changing what do you think about

46:37.680 --> 46:44.400
that Helen well I think there's definitely something going on in that respect I think that

46:47.280 --> 46:52.800
particularly consequentially for the Biden administration just because the US is much more

46:53.600 --> 46:59.040
important as a power than the European states although they face some of the same domestic

46:59.040 --> 47:05.600
political issues around this they're going to come under considerable pressure and obviously in the

47:05.600 --> 47:11.200
case of the United States with an election next year that is going to intensify that pressure

47:11.200 --> 47:19.440
of how far they can go in supporting Israel without causing themselves very considerable

47:20.000 --> 47:27.360
political problems I mean I think that it it is though aided by the fact that the energy

47:27.360 --> 47:35.120
situation thus far is not particularly I wouldn't say it's not particularly worrying because I think

47:35.120 --> 47:41.840
it is worrying but we're not seeing a serious crisis in the energy markets in a way in which we did

47:41.840 --> 47:49.360
pretty much immediately on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and I think that does go back to the fact

47:49.360 --> 47:55.280
that the energy situation in the Middle East including Israel's vulnerability on energy

47:55.280 --> 48:02.400
security issues is just not what it was in the past then we can add in the fact that the United

48:02.400 --> 48:10.560
States as well as being now not insignificant exporter of oil has got the capacity to release more

48:10.560 --> 48:16.080
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 180 million barrels released really in the context of the

48:17.600 --> 48:23.920
Russia's invasion of Ukraine none of these things were true in the 1970s indeed the whole

48:23.920 --> 48:31.520
Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in response to the crisis of the 1970s instead of

48:31.520 --> 48:36.480
being an exporter the United States was on a trajectory in the 1970s to become in the largest

48:36.480 --> 48:44.880
oil importer in the in the world and so I think that the immediate crunch points around the energy

48:44.880 --> 48:53.120
situation are nowhere near as difficult as they were in the 70s but just to go back to a question

48:53.120 --> 48:56.880
that I didn't answer and I think this does come into matters though is I do think there's they

48:56.880 --> 49:01.920
are still you know very profound resentment in a lot of oil producing countries amongst citizens

49:03.040 --> 49:08.240
about what they look what looks to them like foreign extractivism with heavy legacy heavy

49:08.240 --> 49:17.200
undertone still of the imperial past I think if you say like why was it not possible for the

49:17.200 --> 49:22.720
international oil companies that got those contracts from the Iraqi government the western ones

49:23.760 --> 49:29.440
essentially to stay there and do well and turn Iraq into the kind of large-scale oil producer

49:29.440 --> 49:35.520
that the Bush administration had in mind in partly it is because of the domestic resistance that they

49:35.520 --> 49:42.160
ran into in Iraq the political situation now partly that's to do with ISIS but it was also to do

49:42.160 --> 49:53.440
with direct attacks on the headquarters of oil companies from angry Iraqi citizens I mean if the

49:53.440 --> 50:02.080
experiment was can Western oil companies go back into a Middle Eastern country after the age of

50:02.080 --> 50:06.720
energy nationalism of the 1970s and succeed well the answer turned out to be no they can't

50:07.680 --> 50:12.560
have you been over there have you traveled in Iraq Iran no I've never been to the Middle East no

50:12.560 --> 50:19.440
okay um and just as an aside are you teaching right now like this semester what are the what

50:19.440 --> 50:25.120
classes are you teaching what is the title of the class I teach uh first year I part

50:25.120 --> 50:28.720
teacher first year course which is the introduction to politics for the students and the undergraduate

50:28.720 --> 50:33.120
program and then I teach a course called the politics of the international economy to the

50:33.200 --> 50:40.480
third years wow and how do you enjoy that a lot I really like teaching yeah I miss it

50:42.160 --> 50:47.600
I'm kind of teaching with the podcast but it's not the same as sitting in the room with 20 19

50:47.600 --> 50:54.080
year olds and having a conversation you know and they're so curious and bright and have their whole

50:54.080 --> 50:59.200
lives ahead of them and it it feels like a privilege and also a responsibility you know

50:59.200 --> 51:06.240
completely yeah yeah yeah um so we're going to get back to the Middle East and I also want to talk

51:06.240 --> 51:13.520
to you about Ukraine but you're a historian and could you speak briefly because I also want to

51:13.520 --> 51:19.520
talk about the United States can you talk briefly about how energy and oil in particular really

51:19.600 --> 51:28.560
set up Britain and later Germany to become key powers in Europe I don't think most people

51:29.200 --> 51:36.880
look at that history from an energy perspective yeah I think that if we look at the the 19th

51:36.880 --> 51:46.720
century and the real rise to economic preeminence of Britain I mean Britain had obviously established

51:46.720 --> 51:56.240
itself as a perhaps the dominant naval power even in the 18th by the middle second third of the the

51:56.240 --> 52:03.920
18th century before the industrial revolution but its economic preeminence comes with the

52:03.920 --> 52:09.280
industrial revolution and if we say then like well why did Britain industrialize before

52:10.240 --> 52:17.200
um any other country in the world I think that the the answer is not only that it had

52:17.760 --> 52:24.480
significant or abundant domestic coal but also because they've been using coal actually for

52:24.480 --> 52:29.040
a very long time for heating purposes pretty much again unlike anywhere else going back

52:30.080 --> 52:36.400
even the 12th century certainly in the third by the 13th century uh it had

52:37.040 --> 52:45.520
incentive to find ways of extracting deeper coal and the steam engine the first point

52:45.520 --> 52:51.440
purpose of the steam engine was to do precisely that to be used in mining and then the steam engine

52:51.440 --> 52:58.320
ran off coal so you kind of like it's a it's a circular phenomenon if you then look at the way

52:58.320 --> 53:04.560
in which British naval power developed in the 19th century and you look at something that I think is

53:04.560 --> 53:09.920
pretty significant in in in world history which is the and I say world history very deliberately

53:09.920 --> 53:18.880
is the first opium war and the opening up of imperial um china its British steam ships um that

53:18.880 --> 53:30.160
now um are able to be much more powerful than any sail based um navy um could be if you then look

53:30.160 --> 53:39.440
at the German um story Germany um is advantaged like Britain by having coal a lot of coal um

53:39.440 --> 53:44.880
but unlike Britain uh it actually doesn't have iron deposits that are adjacent to the coal

53:44.880 --> 53:51.280
a quite a lot of the iron deposits are in Alsace-Lorraine France doesn't have coal even just saying

53:51.280 --> 53:56.560
that like that explains I think quite a lot as to why between 1870 and the creation of Germany

53:57.520 --> 54:02.000
through the Second World War Alsace-Lorraine is a central part of the conflict between

54:02.000 --> 54:09.600
like France and Germany explains why the European coal and steel community the first part of

54:10.720 --> 54:17.760
the the European project effectively was a means of giving France access to that West German

54:18.800 --> 54:24.640
coal if we then bring oil into it the thing that's really hard for every European power except for

54:24.640 --> 54:29.360
Austria really in the beginning of the 20th century is they don't have any domestically

54:30.160 --> 54:33.440
if you look at the beginning of the 20th century the two large oil producers of the

54:33.440 --> 54:39.120
United States and Russia I don't think it's a coincidence that they are going to go on

54:39.120 --> 54:45.520
albeit in the case of Russia in the form of the Soviet Union to dominate the 20th century geopolitically

54:45.520 --> 54:52.240
to take over the European imperial powers by contrast are going to be you know eclipsed Britain

54:52.240 --> 54:57.120
tries to deal with its oil problem which it does sort of moderately successfully by extending its

54:57.120 --> 55:07.280
empire around oil i.e sphere of influence in Persia what will be Iraq in the post what was

55:07.280 --> 55:15.360
Mesopotamia what will become Iraq in the post First World War world Germany loses desperately

55:15.360 --> 55:19.840
in that contest during the in the in the First World War it ends up with nothing in the Middle

55:20.800 --> 55:25.600
it tries to take Baku which is the basis of the now Soviet oil industry and fails

55:26.480 --> 55:33.120
so Hitler's invasion of Russia has puzzled historians but you suggested it was at least

55:33.120 --> 55:38.640
partly about oil did i understand that correctly from from your work yeah i mean i'm not the first

55:38.640 --> 55:44.400
person who who who he's made this argument though people who know a lot more about that about this

55:45.280 --> 55:56.640
than than i do but i think that if you understand that Germany was in from its point of view and

55:56.640 --> 56:02.400
this is i'm not talking about Weimar Germany so after the the first war in a really very difficult

56:02.400 --> 56:12.880
position because it had lost the war in the Middle East is its bank made well one of its most

56:12.880 --> 56:18.080
important banks if not the its most important bank Deutsche Bank which had effectively operated as

56:18.080 --> 56:26.800
its international oil company in the pre-1914 world held 25 percent of the shares in the what was

56:26.800 --> 56:33.120
then called the Turkish Petroleum Company which had the mandate for the concession rather sorry

56:33.120 --> 56:39.920
for drilling in Mesopotamia and as part of the peace then Germany had to hand over or Deutsche

56:40.000 --> 56:50.560
Bank had to hand over that ultimately to France so the Germans begin in the Weimar period on a

56:50.560 --> 56:56.000
program of creating synthetic fuel which is essentially to create an artificial version of

56:56.000 --> 57:04.960
oil from coal Hitler expands yeah Hitler expands that program but there is no way that he can engage

57:04.960 --> 57:11.200
the Nazis under Hitler can engage in wall of conquest without much more oil supply than they

57:11.200 --> 57:18.560
actually have and by 1941 the second half well by the summer of 1941 it's it's pretty clear

57:18.560 --> 57:25.200
that the conquered territories that Germany Nazi Germany has by that point plus synthetic fuel

57:25.200 --> 57:33.600
is not sufficient and that Hitler and Hitler was i would say apocalyptically obsessed with energy

57:34.560 --> 57:39.120
is is that he thought that there's only way forward for Germany if he was going to stay in

57:39.120 --> 57:44.720
the war was to conquer Baku which is in present day Abajajam which was then the center of the

57:44.720 --> 57:56.080
Soviet oil industry this is going to sound like a obtuse question but if oil is the master resource

57:56.080 --> 58:01.200
and what you said Hitler was obsessed with oil and

58:03.280 --> 58:10.560
homo sapiens historically have gone to war when there are resource or geographical limits

58:10.560 --> 58:15.360
could you imagine fighting a war a kinetic war on renewable energy

58:16.320 --> 58:26.000
no not the same way i mean i think that i think that there is a difference between

58:28.880 --> 58:37.920
the geopolitical ramifications of the arbitrary distribution either under the earth's surface

58:38.080 --> 58:45.600
or under the earth's waters of oil and gas then there is of metals which is what is obviously

58:45.600 --> 58:57.120
an issue in low carbon energy leaving the uranium question aside on on on nuclear and

59:00.400 --> 59:03.680
at a certain point i mean people who are

59:08.720 --> 59:15.120
engineers uh where we engineers is perhaps not the right word but there are people who know a

59:15.120 --> 59:22.080
lot more about metals they just put it that way then than i do and it's not difficult i think

59:22.080 --> 59:31.200
there to imagine that at a certain point that it will be possible to recycle the metals that are

59:31.200 --> 59:40.320
necessary for the energy transition and that it is also possible that it will be possible to

59:41.360 --> 59:49.600
innovate technologically and find ways to do what are presently being done done let's say by like

59:49.600 --> 59:55.760
lithium in relation to batteries in different ways now energies we both know now isn't like that

59:56.720 --> 01:00:03.760
you extract oil or gas and you get to use it once

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:12.480
and i think that that makes a like that is quite a fundamental difference between where we might be

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:21.280
going geopolitically with the um now that isn't to say that i'm somebody who is really like gong

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:31.920
how optimistic about the energy transition but i'm not at least yet convinced that the the geopolitics

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:41.440
of metals has to be quite as dangerous and fraught as the geopolitics of oil and gas and

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:50.560
particularly oil were in the 20th century so your summary comments there are that we're going to need

01:00:50.560 --> 01:01:00.000
a lot of metals and materials in order to decarbonize but that rematerialization won't have the same

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.720
geopolitical constraints of those nations that happen to live where there were ancient oceans

01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.720
and therefore hydrocarbons were buried but let me ask a subset of that which is

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:23.120
is the global cooperation and the geopolitics such that with this George Floyd moment in the Middle

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:33.760
East and the anti-colonialist kind of simmering up around the world will the global north and west

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:42.640
be able to forge agreements in african nations and in southeast asia where a lot of these

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:52.800
metals reside is is there still the the political economy that existed 50 years ago to scale that

01:01:53.840 --> 01:02:00.880
is that a constraint yeah i mean that's the point where i'm much more pessimistic i think it's a

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:11.280
particular problem for european countries um both because european countries are significantly

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:20.720
more resource poor than the united states they're also largely quite densely populated there's

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:29.120
going to be much more resistance to domestic exploration for mining in european countries

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:33.760
and i think that ultimately will be in the united states i'm not saying there won't be but i i just

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:39.920
think in europe it's a really made proof to be a really hard constraint on exploring those domestic

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:48.560
possibilities and then for the european countries they're going back to try and cultivate private

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:57.360
sector investment backed by state support often in parts of the world that they once colonized

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:07.760
where people have got long memories about europeans and resource extraction in those countries

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:18.480
and i think you can see that in what was happening in west africa just over the course of the summer

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:25.200
niger in particular where france had been getting a quarter of its uranium

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:35.680
from there was a coup the language of this is partly bound up i think with a certain kind of

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:44.560
resource nationalism and i think that is going to be the the norm for western countries and

01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:51.920
particularly european ones in trying to cultivate relationships economic relationships in places

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:59.920
that are metal rich and it's going to be even harder when actually european well it's not here

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:04.880
it's just actually everybody western countries are saying look we're going to do the energy

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:10.080
transition while we've got to keep our fossil fuel energy system going we're going to use that

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:18.080
basically as our insurance policy but you can't do that you've got to jump straight into this energy

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:22.960
future that we don't really trust is quite right coming and we're going to make it a condition

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:29.200
of us doing things that might help you with the energy transition and facilitate our investments

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:36.960
in your metal supply chains by with conditional demands that you don't build new pipelines so

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:46.320
oil pipelines or like gas pipelines or you don't build new coal fired power stations and i just

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.600
think that that that that's just like politically just not it's not going to work at all and i think

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:56.960
that everything that happened last year in terms of russia's invasion of ukraine and the european

01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:02.800
reaction to that which was when there was a difficulty european countries including britain

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:10.160
which was hardly the most exposed where russian gas was concerned went back to keeping coal fired

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:15.680
power stations that were due to close open and they did this in the british case like just

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.520
months after they'd been caught by glasgow lecturing the chinese and the indians and indonesians

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:28.800
about how they had to make commitments to phase out coal by 2045 and what they showed was britain

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.400
and others european countries was in the emergency where electricity was concerned coal was the energy

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:40.160
source of like last resort so why should anybody listen so anything european countries have got

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:45.920
to say about phasing out coal when they've when when they've seen that and i think you can hear

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.800
quite a number of like indian diplomats or indian ministers say things that make pretty clear well

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:55.440
your hypocrisy was exposed really very very clearly we're just not we were not really interested in

01:05:55.440 --> 01:06:02.960
listening to what you've got to say and right now as we speak india is bursting through all time

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:12.000
coal production in that nation and the world for that matter yeah yeah um so let's move to the united

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:20.160
states uh i knew that i would be running out of time with you um and we're we're halfway through

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:28.000
the the time period that i i promised um because you know there's horizontal and and deep vertical

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:36.640
complexity on this entire situation um there's geopolitics uh there's history uh there's energy

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:42.000
and then there's there's money which we haven't talked about so a large part of the united states

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:48.800
geopolitical strength in the mid 20th century came from dominance in energy markets and then we had

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:57.840
the conventional peak of us crude in 1970 followed by uh nixon eliminating the gold standard and from

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:05.680
that period on much of the u.s geopolitical power has come from a huge expansion of dollar

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:11.920
denominated debt predominantly uh and developing nations in combination with the petrodollar to

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:18.320
support the largest military in the world uh is this source of strength from dollar denominated

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:27.440
debt strong enough to hold the geopolitical sway that the u.s is used to even if the dollar were

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:32.400
to become unlinked from the purchase of oil in effect a decline of the the petrodollar

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:41.680
i i think this is a really important question night i think if we go back to the the 70s

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:49.200
and we say why didn't american power unravel more than it did in the 70s because obviously

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:58.720
in significant ways militarily it really did unravel in the in the the 1970s i think the moves

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:06.640
towards financial liberalization and the ability to reconstruct a new dollar system after dollar

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:12.000
gold convertibility been ended by nixon and after the fixed exchange rate regime had come

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:19.840
to an end uh in march 1973 that is absolutely like central to that and if you push that thought

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:27.600
a little bit further and said like why didn't the world that was imagined by some in what now

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.640
gets called the global south uh of commodity exporters becoming more powerful commodity

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:41.040
importers falling down the hierarchy so to speak i think a significant part of the answer

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:48.000
is because finance became much more uh central to the way in which the the world economy

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:55.840
worked and the united states was able as you said to basically have world economy on the

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:02.720
debt side credit side run through dollar debt it was able to pay for

01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:11.760
its own imports of oil in its own currency which was a luxury that that nobody else had the

01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:18.320
buddhist had it for a while and got them in a way like through the the 60s but in the 70s they

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:24.720
into need well until the north sea oil started but they end up with a dollar buying buying

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:34.000
oil in dollar problem indeed just on that i mean the french in the 1980s described the strength

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:44.000
of the dollar after the vulgar shock as a third oil price shock so that there's lots of things

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:50.320
that privileged the united states still about that world that emerges out the world economy that

01:09:50.320 --> 01:10:00.080
merges out of the um the 1970s now i think there's an absolutely no doubt whatsoever that that some

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:06.480
of the large oil imports is obviously starting with china would like nothing more than to be able

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:14.000
to be done with the dollar when it comes to buying oil imports and gas imports for that

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.760
matter um too i mean china has enough problems it's generated by its foreign and oil gas dependency

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:27.600
without having to deal with the need to pay for this uh in dollars on on on on top of um or else

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:34.000
but i think it's not so clear yet that that's really a very attractive proposition to the

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:40.560
sellers and certainly where Saudi Arabia um is um concerned because Saudi Arabia became

01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:47.200
deeply integrated itself into that dollar world the post 19 the post gold dollar world let's call

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:55.200
it that that emerged in the in in the 70s it's willingness to buy um american um debt and i

01:10:55.200 --> 01:11:02.320
think then what has happened since 2008 really actually since 2007 since the first bit of the

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:08.960
financial crash in august of 2007 is in terms of dollar credit um the position of the united

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.960
states and the federal reserve in particular they've become significantly more important

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:19.280
since then than they even than they were um before and that china is much more vulnerable

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.560
to the fed's monetary decision making to crises of confidence in the euro dollar system than it

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:34.640
was pre um 2008 because it was less involved in it so is is that i think now that the the euro

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:42.000
dollar system and and and dollar um dollar debt is actually probably more important than ever

01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:48.960
in some respects at least and whatever the incentives to get out of the system which are

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:55.520
overwhelming from the point of view of of china the actual ability to do so is the actual capacity

01:11:55.520 --> 01:12:02.720
to do that is is much harder than it would seem i think so there might be a desire to get off of

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:09.280
the dollar as the world's reserve currency um and the way that countries have to buy oil but the

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.000
mechanics of doing that i mean the dollar has lots of problems but it's better than all the

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.960
alternatives let me ask you this yeah no no go on well i this is kind of a meta question but

01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:28.320
what really underpins the strength and ubiquity and confidence in the u.s dollar

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:34.160
is it the productivity and the size of the economy or that we're 90 plus percent energy

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:40.160
independent or is it really the military and if it's the military we're printing more dollars and

01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:46.480
going further into debt a trillion dollars every couple months to pay for the military and everything

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:53.600
else there's this like uh unraveling there of of of how it was all put together what do you think

01:12:53.600 --> 01:13:02.000
about that i mean i i i think that this is a is is a quite hard question to unpack all the different

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:08.720
ways in which dollar strength works but my instinct is that actually it's the way the

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:16.000
international banking system works that's actually the most important thing now about

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:25.520
the dollar's position um and i think you can see that in the ways in which the united states

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:32.960
has under the last few presidents pretty much like all of them being able to use other countries

01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:40.480
companies access to the american banking system to basically make various bits of foreign policy

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:47.360
work so if you say like why would they be able to bring the europeans in line on the sanctions

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:56.880
against iran both in terms of obama's initial policy of getting around to the negotiating table

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:04.800
and then in terms of after trump ended the iran nuclear agreement it's because it's just too

01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:13.120
difficult for anyone's companies to be shut out of the american banking system now again

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:24.560
the willingness to use that weapon incentivizes resistance to it because who wants to be constrained

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:31.600
by american foreign policy if they can not be but actually finding ways out i mean the european

01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:40.320
as i understand it anyway the european countries tried quite hard to find ways of still being able to

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.880
make financial transactions with iran after 2018 and found it really pretty much impossible to do so

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:56.720
so let's move to russia and the ukraine since we're doing a whirlwind tour of international

01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:04.080
political economy so russia's invasion in ukraine despite the tragedy there nicely timed for your

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:11.360
book release had profound energy price and security implications for europe as well as other parts of

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:19.680
the world so putin my colleague art burman said on a podcast has a a degree in economics focused on

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:25.440
energy and there are some people believe it was this ghost written or plagiarized but still he

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:32.000
seems to know a lot more about energy than most of his western counterparts so how much of this

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:40.320
ukraine invasion in february of 2022 was about energy versus just a territorial play and how

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:48.480
did his earlier campaign and Crimea fit into this strategy i think that you can't begin to understand

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:55.040
relations between russia and post independence ukraine so going back to december of 1991

01:15:55.600 --> 01:16:03.600
without making energy quite central to that and a significant part of that is obviously the pipelines

01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:11.600
that ran through ukraine or run through ukraine i should say both oil and gas right so from the

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:18.720
point of view of russia the disillusion of the soviet union and the independence of ukraine was

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:26.400
a complete strategic disaster where energy was concerned because at that point in the 90s all its

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:34.800
oil and gas markets go westwards and the pipelines now go through an independent

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:43.760
state with which it's got historically extremely complicated and so then i think you can say is

01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:53.520
is that putin from relatively early from when he came into power kind of worked quite systematically

01:16:53.520 --> 01:17:01.200
to try to change that on terms of european markets and that was really not just what the

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:07.040
Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were about but his moves to build more pipelines under

01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:14.480
the black sea and he wanted to be able to weaken ukraine by shutting it out of russia's transit

01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:22.400
system and indeed from his point of view eliminate the risk that ukraine posed to the reliability

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:29.440
of russia as an energy exporter i think if you then go to the Crimea crisis you can see that he

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:36.560
even with Yanukovych he was supposedly russia friendly in office is Yanukovych had been making

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:42.320
deals with various of the western oil companies including for exploration under the for the exploration

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:49.440
under the the black sea and by taking control of Crimea and proving russia's position in the black

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:57.520
sea the direct control of savastopol there was a certain energy logic to that too i think if you

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:06.400
then go though to the events of february of 2022 and say is energy an explanation of this move this is

01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:11.520
where i think it's a lot harder to say that there was an energy motive that doesn't mean to say that

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:21.440
there aren't resource energy resources that issue particularly in the in the Donbas and that that

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:26.640
was the area or part of the area anyway where there were some prospects of ukrainian shale

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:33.840
though i should say you shale gas that is that by the time that even by the time that the Crimea

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:39.440
had happened the annexation of Crimea had happened it was already clear that the shale in poland which

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:46.240
had been particularly hyped up as possibly the equivalent to the united states turned out not

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.480
to be like that the rocks didn't fracture like in the same way so it may be that ukrainian shale

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:59.440
was always a dead end but he kind of brought that to an end by the moves in 2014 but i struggled to

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:06.400
see really an energy motive for what happened last year i think that's much more about a

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:14.560
basic rejection of ukraine as an independent nation state and some concern about the growth

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:22.320
of nato power around the black sea do you think putin imagined or predicted or believed that he

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:28.960
would lose europe as a gas market when he invaded ukraine i think this is hard i think you can see

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:37.360
that he tried to put some pressure on the european governments in the latter months of 2021 so there

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:43.360
was some reduced supply through various of the pipelines going on often sort of presented as

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:48.960
being for technical reasons but i think it's probably better seen as kind of like warnings

01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:58.080
that i could i could do a lot inflict a lot more harm on you um than um this

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:09.200
i think that the thing where you can say that he may have misread the signals quite a bit

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:16.400
is actually on Nord Stream 2 encouraged really by the biden administration which would

01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:25.600
move the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 about six i think it was it was at a may or june of 2021

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:31.680
so from that point of view i mean the germans who've basically been fighting a rearguard

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:37.520
action trying to defend Nord Stream 2 ever since the annexation of crime area sorry the year after

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:45.200
so 2015 when they made the agreement to build Nord Stream 2 must have looked like well we've

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:50.800
held on despite all that american pressure we've been vindicated we've got our pipeline we won't

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:58.560
be dependent on that unreliable supply coming through ukraine for very much longer and i could

01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:06.720
see that putin could have thought the germans aren't going to give up on this just at the point when

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:13.440
they've got what they've been secured what they've invested spent a lot of political credibility

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:20.640
um on but i think he just misjudged really quite profoundly how difficult it would be

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.720
for a german government to legitimate the energy relationship with russia in the context of all

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:33.200
our war against ukraine i just think that that was such a shock in germany that for germany to then

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.360
carry on with the status quo now in lots of ways i think they carried on with the status quo more

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:44.080
than it seems but they had rhetorically to impudiate that relationship and i think perhaps he didn't

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:52.560
really understand that how did europe become so dependent on russian oil and natural gas and given

01:21:52.640 --> 01:22:01.760
your knowledge of history and the world wars in the 20th century based on oil

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:10.720
and coal underpinning the first industrial economies led by the uk and and and germany

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:18.000
is this going to be the beginning of a phase of deindustrialization because of what's happening

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:24.160
in europe i mean i i think the answer from um germany's point of view which i think is the

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:32.080
the crucial european country where this russian energy relationship is um concern that in the age

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:38.800
of oil that russia whether it was russia or whether it was the soviet union whether it's back to

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:43.760
russia again is the most obvious

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:54.800
oil relationship for germany to have if you think of it as there being three big blocks the americas

01:22:56.480 --> 01:23:07.920
the middle east and russia just geography alone would align germany in russia's direction

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:14.480
and then if you think about it um historically the periods of aberration

01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:23.360
until what's happened in the last year were the period when hitler went from the nazi

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:34.880
soviet pact to outright conquest and then the period between well the first 15 years or so of

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:44.240
the cold war when west germany wasn't buying oil from the soviet union so in one sense you could

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:50.000
put the question the other way around is like let's explain why those ones were the way that they

01:23:51.200 --> 01:24:00.000
were if you look at it then in terms of post war history so why did that period of the

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:06.080
early cold war come to an end the beginning of the answer for west germany is the serious crisis

01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:14.880
because aden hara the conrad aden hara the west german chancellor at the time he was utterly

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:20.400
appalled by what eisen hara did he went off to paris to see the french prime minister guy

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:27.440
moley he was there i believe when eden rang moley to tell him that they were going to have to

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.480
pull out and aden hara said europe will be your revenge

01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:42.480
meaning the creation of the european economic community but in practical terms is they began

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.920
which had already been started by italian oil company further discussions with the soviet

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:54.160
regime about buying oil from the the the soviet union now the americans put sufficient pressure

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:59.600
on west germany to make that really difficult again use of extraterritorial pressure of

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:08.560
extraterritorial sanctions so actually west germany was quite late of the european countries

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:12.960
or put it this way it wasn't the first of the european countries to either get soviet oil

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:19.360
or later to make gas agreements but once the taboo in cold war terms are being lifted which

01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:24.560
it really was by the johnson administration in the united states then i think west germany went

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:31.840
back to what is the more geographically obvious thing for it to do which is to have a energy

01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:38.720
relationship with what was then the the soviet union the the big problem for germany in the

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:43.440
post cold war world was really this ukrain issue in this sense germany and russia were in the same

01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:51.360
place about this because they the germans didn't want to be dependent for their energy supply on a

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:59.520
ukrainian economically christian ridden country for a lot of the time in the post independence period

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:07.200
where at times of difficulty there was siphoning off of the gas coming through the pipelines

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:13.520
in terms of the conflicts about pricing between russia and ukraine and and that germany would take

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:20.320
an energy security hit for the nature of the russia ukraine relationship far better logically

01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:24.880
from its point of view to have a pipeline that went under the Baltic sea or two pipelines that

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:30.000
went under the Baltic sea and bypassed russia so bypass ukraine and allowed for direct russia

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.400
relationship but but now that's ancient history so now they're dependent on middle eastern

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:42.080
lng and stuff from all over the world but now the middle east is in crisis too so that adds

01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:51.040
further risk to future energy imports for for europe now completely i mean you you can see that this

01:26:52.880 --> 01:27:00.960
this nightmare in terms of like which poison do you pick here continues to you have three european

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:07.200
countries in the space of the last three months that have signed long term 20 year plus 27 year

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:14.800
plus i think in each case lng agreements with katar the dutch the italians and the french

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:24.240
and katar as we know is the at least as important sponsor in a way of of hamas as iran

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:34.640
is and that would be if there is a if there's an equivalent of the arab oil embargo on the

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:44.960
us and the netherlands back in 19 october 73 to march 74 it would be katar embargoing the sale of

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.760
liquid natural gas to european countries including britain with who've with with which it's had

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:56.080
long-term contracts for quite a while if that were to happen i mean that would be

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.720
a cataclysmic event for the world economy and for europe yeah and this goes back to the question

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.320
that we came up that you asked and i don't think i answered about the prospects for

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:12.240
deindustrialization essentially in germany and i think that that is real i mean maybe

01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:21.520
deindustrialization is you know too hyperbolic but we can see that the german industrial economy

01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:30.160
benefited very much from cheap relatively cheap pipeline gas from russia take that away

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:37.600
germany has to import significantly more expensive liquid natural gas from a starting

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:42.480
place in which it had no liquid natural gas ports let alone any literally long-term liquid

01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:49.040
natural gas contracts it had to be bought in the in the spot market you can see all kinds of

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.680
industrial production that was heavily gas dependent closed down during the course of

01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:58.720
last winter that's one of the reasons why european countries got through last winter

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.720
without more problems where gas supply is concerned because there was you know demand

01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:13.840
destruction in the industrial sector particularly in germany if you then were to have katar being

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:19.200
willing to use a gas weapon against european countries after they've already taken it from

01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.240
russia because we should remember it wasn't european countries that stopped buying pipeline gas

01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:35.200
from Nord Stream 1 it was russia that effectively embargoed the sale of that gas is katar politically

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:44.000
and diplomatically friendly with iran i mean i think that that's that's not an entirely

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:51.920
straightforward relationship either what is true is is that unlike the arab other arab states

01:29:52.640 --> 01:30:00.080
they have shared gas interests with iran though those two countries have massive amounts of natural

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:07.200
gas yeah i mean it's because they're basically it's like one big gas field with a katar side and a

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:14.400
iranian side to it so where where does the uk your country stand in all this your well past peak

01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:20.800
in your domestic energy production but like the usa you're also a financial and a military hub

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:30.000
so is the multipolar world the united states the uk and then a few satellites that that need our

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.440
military and energy support or where does the uk stand in all of this well i think one of the

01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:42.240
things that's really interesting if you look at long history uh and look for the patterns like

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:50.560
over time um is britain withdrew from east of syria so it ended as i said earlier

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:58.960
it's imperial presence um a military presence in the middle east um in 1971 announced that in january

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:07.440
of 1968 it did the buddhist navy did have some presence around the persian gulf by the end of

01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:14.320
the decade but nothing like the scale of the americans um then we have the period from late

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:22.480
70s through the 80s into the into the 90s uh of um domestic oil production being quite high

01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:32.080
via the uh north sea and then since i think it's 2004 um buddhants basically become a net energy

01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:37.120
importer again so we're quite some time now we're nearly two decades into britain being back to

01:31:37.120 --> 01:31:45.200
being a net energy importer and what you can see in the 2010s under the david camberans

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:52.000
government is that a reorientation back to the middle east you might even say that britain

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:58.800
has come back east of syria again 2015 announced there'd be a new naval base in like borrain

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:07.360
clearly um cultivating um relations with the united arab emirates which is an important

01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:13.840
investor uh in the uk and i think that the finance is i think it was actually another agreement

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:20.000
with the united arab emirates just like a couple of weeks ago a new investment um agreement sort

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.400
of tied to energy transition too but the gulf that the britain is going back to where it's been

01:32:26.400 --> 01:32:30.720
because it's gone back into the middle east because it's still got that historical relationship

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:37.840
particularly with those with those smaller um gulf states because it's become much more dependent

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:44.400
back on that part of the world post north sea oil so when i talk to you helen it's like a positive

01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:51.360
feedback dynamic that i don't have fewer questions i have more questions um let me ask you a couple

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:59.600
really hard questions about the middle east so if israel pursues the brass ring moment of

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:06.080
evicting palestinian populations from gaza and the west bank possibly

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:13.200
is it possible that arab governments collectively will have to respond to that and what would be

01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:20.800
the implications i think that arab governments would have to like respond to that um but i think

01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:31.120
that that very fact and the fact that the israelis need to find a way of dealing with or they have

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:36.320
to have some kind of plan for what happens in gaza once the military action is over i mean that they

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:45.360
can't alienate arab states like that and cause them that kind of um difficulty i mean i think in

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:53.920
this respect we really need to like understand just like what a colossal problem is well now

01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:02.000
faces after what has happened because the status quo any version of the status quo of the the

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.680
previous day before the 7th of um october is completely gone i mean they're basically under

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:22.160
netanaryu treated hamas as uh a quasi partner even though it goes far as saying for isolating the

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:29.840
gaza problem from israel and then relying on the technology of the wall and the iron dome to deal

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:40.240
with any potential security threat from hamas so let hamas rule um gaza let it be the case that

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:46.160
because they're hamas you can't engage with a question about a palestinian state we defend

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:51.120
ourselves with technology and it's all come crashing like down around them but when all said

01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:57.920
and done whenever they do militarily somebody's going to have to take responsibility for gaza

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:02.480
for them because i cannot believe that they're going to go back in there either and expel the

01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:07.520
entire population because the united states won't let them do that um or thing that they can rule it

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:13.040
directly themselves they need arab help in order to do that some by some means or another

01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:21.280
okay this is a crazy question to ask uh and i know you're not a religious scholar um a political

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:28.320
scholar but how much do end time prophecies around various religious groups play into

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:36.000
this situation specifically israel's claim to rebuild the third temple and muslim and evangelical

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:42.720
christians and mormons saying that such event would trigger the return of christ i've heard this

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:49.360
all pined in the recent week i mean i actually am interest very interested in religious questions

01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:56.320
but i mean i i don't even know really begin to begin to know how to answer that um question i mean

01:35:56.320 --> 01:36:04.960
all i would say is this is that i think that one of the conceptual failures let's call it that um

01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:11.360
of the way in which the israeli government under net and r u dealt with hamas was an inability to see

01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:21.840
its millenarian fundamentally millenarian tendencies uh and that millenarian what is that

01:36:21.840 --> 01:36:30.960
meaning like the the end times okay yeah justify any kind of like destruction in order to bring

01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:38.480
like the new world right um about and i i i think that they didn't understand that aspect

01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:40.880
they turned a blind eye to that aspect of hamas

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:51.280
so how how are let's let's bring it down to a a fine point here with everything going on

01:36:52.240 --> 01:37:02.240
china russia the us debts hamas israel energy depletion we haven't talked much about climate

01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:08.800
change um but as geopolitical tension increases across these different power nodes globally

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:18.080
i think energy insecurity for a number of nations will increasingly uh be um politically very

01:37:18.080 --> 01:37:25.360
important do you think that this is going to push nations towards green energy aspirations

01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:33.120
or uh in contrast to our resurgence of coal use or maybe we're going to have to learn to cope with

01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:40.160
a lower energy lifestyle which we've seen some previews with uh last year in in europe uh what

01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:47.120
do you what do you think about all that i think that there's no doubt you can see this clearly

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:57.120
in europe that energy insecurity driven by geopolitics increased the desire to speed up

01:37:57.120 --> 01:38:02.080
the energy transition but nothing that happened in europe last year in that respect changed the

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.840
difficulties facing the energy transition indeed you could argue and i would argue that they increased

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:13.200
the difficulties because they made the monetary and financial environment in which it has to happen

01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:20.480
harder than was previously the case because they intensified what were already the growing pressures

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:26.880
on energy um inflation so

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:37.920
you can try and speed things up but desires say isn't going isn't going to do that i find it hard to see

01:38:38.880 --> 01:38:46.080
a world over the next five years let's say certainly five to ten years where there isn't

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:53.440
going to be a politics of reduced energy consumption i think the politicians in western countries will

01:38:53.440 --> 01:39:03.680
try very very hard to avoid that they will keep looking for fixes that aren't really there to deal

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:11.920
with these problems to you know kick the can down the road some more but um

01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:21.920
there are just a whole set and i think we would agree about this of systemic energy

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:29.520
difficulties across the different energy sources they interact with each other in

01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:37.360
quite dysfunctional um ways and there is of some kind going to be some kind of reckoning with that

01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:47.440
i don't know i i i know enough to understand that making predictions about when those dynamics are

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:53.680
going to play themselves out all the form in which they're going to take it is is is very very difficult

01:39:53.840 --> 01:40:01.040
um because there are so many contingencies particularly actually on the on the on the

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:10.640
geopolitical side that can derail what seem to be passive development at any any any one time

01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:13.840
and it's a it's a strange and this is why i think it's hard to think about because on the one hand

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:18.720
it's it is systemic but on the other hand it is vulnerable to contingent events

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:26.480
well it's been forestalled by debt writ large um around the world um i i want to be respectful

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:34.160
of of your evening um well let me ask you a few more questions um you're an energy scholar and a

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:42.960
historian uh given everything you just outlined for me what would be a couple of uh unofficial

01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:49.280
unofficial pieces of advice you would have to the leaders on Downing Street or in in your

01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:59.760
country ahead of um probably um reduced energy use you said earlier the political uh um football

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:05.680
of energy and using less in the uk is probably in not too distant future do you have any thoughts

01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:13.840
of recommendations i mean the the thing that frustrates me um in terms of what i see in in

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:21.600
britain and i wouldn't go any further than that in this respect is that i don't see much evidence the

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:32.720
politicians think about energy across the board yeah i think they have bits of energy policy

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:40.240
here and there some of it perhaps better thought out than others but i don't think

01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:48.400
that they see the ways in which all these different problems interact with each other

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:53.360
and all the way in which that they interact with the monetary environment in a way i think they've

01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:01.600
got better understanding the geopolitics perhaps in the last year to some extent um anyway i think

01:42:01.680 --> 01:42:09.680
that is it possible that they could could they be educated uh or is this systemic story that

01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:14.640
you and i are painting almost like impossible for an elected official to integrate

01:42:18.400 --> 01:42:22.240
i think this is a really interesting question because i think in the past the politicians

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:31.120
have actually understood this quite well in western countries so i think that energy blindness to

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:41.440
use your language now has got a history to it it's not just a like static conceptual failure

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:49.520
it's things happen at some point in let's say we're gonna this you know 80s 90s whenever

01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:59.760
it whenever uh it is some i think um understanding that was sort of passed generationally down at

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:04.800
least top-level politicians and officials that say in civil servants like in britain

01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:13.440
somewhere got lost that is my i don't have a uh i really worked out history of that but

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:20.640
i have a strong sense that that general picture that i just said there um is um true so in principle

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:28.160
i can't see any reason why today's politicians today's officials can't understand the kind of

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:33.360
things in which we've been talking about indeed quite the contrary i mean i'd just say look at

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:40.000
myself you know 10 10 years ago when i started things so you know this is literally 10 2013

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.760
i couldn't be gone so i've had this conversation that we've been having now for like the best part

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:52.400
like of two hours most of this is like self education over a decade because i understood

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:58.080
enough back in 2013 to think i really really should try to understand this because i think it's

01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:05.760
going to shape the world in which we all live for some time to come now i see no reason that i

01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:10.720
can educate myself to do that i take it from your story you've done that at some point too

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:16.400
that other people who in positions of power can't do this as well well the differences they are playing

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:22.800
whack-a-mole every day and they have 15 minute uh time spans let me ask you this so you're an

01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:29.840
energy scholar uh and a teacher i was a professor but only a teacher really how much time do you

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:38.080
spend uh helen every week reading uh or listening to podcasts or educating yourself on on the world

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:46.960
or the world's history i mean i try to yeah i i try to spend quite a reasonable amount of time

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:57.200
each um week uh i'm also like uh very busy uh as an academic uh i teach quite a lot i enjoy

01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:04.080
teaching um quite a lot so some weeks that i do better than others and sometimes like a few months

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:08.560
will go by and then i'll see something and think god i should have understood that like at least

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:15.360
six weeks ago and i've missed something like quite significant and and then you here dive into it to

01:45:15.360 --> 01:45:22.320
and then i dive into it and try it yeah and then so i i'm i learn a lot on the run to be honest i mean

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:31.200
that's part of the nature of the world in which we live me too so so like me you are an analyst

01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:37.840
that sees all this unfolding but we're kind of observing it like we're watching a movie and we're

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:46.960
explaining it but we're also living it helen um so how do you personally cope with learning about

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:56.160
the energy geopolitical financial crisis that we're facing and then living and this is your life

01:45:56.160 --> 01:46:01.520
and our life that that we're a part of that how do you compartmentalize or how do you manage that

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:10.800
that's a good question i um there are times and to be honest it's usually like at night

01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:23.280
when i just think this is this is a world of like such such danger uh it's quite terrifying

01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:31.600
um my day mind is generally a lot better at coping and that was because you're surrounded by bright

01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:39.280
smiling curious young humans and uh nice buildings and lots of books and food and such night mind

01:46:39.280 --> 01:46:48.080
yeah but i i mean i'm a quite a fan of lord of the rings me too and um i say to myself and i say

01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:53.360
i say this to my niece sometimes that i like that bit when gandalf's trying to explain to

01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:02.480
frodo why when frodo says i wish it hadn't happened in my time and gandalf says basically so do i so

01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:09.680
does everyone who gets to live in such a time but we don't get to choose when we um live we just

01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:14.960
get to choose what to do with our time we just get to choose what to do with our time and i think

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:22.960
that is probably kind of the way that i do try and live in um this respect and i find for myself

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:30.480
i'm not saying this would be true for everybody that i find that trying to live open-eyed and trying

01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:40.800
to cultivate inner resilience that that is better for me than living with denial well i think that

01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:47.760
is true for many of us and many of the people listening to this podcast um and building on that

01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:54.960
do you have recommendations for those listening who agree with your overview and synthesis uh

01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:03.040
and kind of foresight of how things might if you squint uh your your picture will hold together in

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:12.640
coming decades do you have advice uh for listeners i mean i'm always very uh cautious about um

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:20.240
advice i mean because i just kind of think um it's hard enough for me to like get to

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:32.960
grit with advice in myself um i mean i think that you know the the the qualities that um are needed

01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:39.200
for the times in which we live well the the quality perhaps is resilience and then we have to cultivate

01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:46.720
that in our cells and sometimes that is going to mean changing um that i think particularly like

01:48:47.520 --> 01:48:52.480
in western countries those of us who've been incredibly privileged in so many um

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:56.720
ways certainly those of us who live absolute lives in western countries because obviously there are

01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:04.480
people um who don't the more that we can understand i think the the economic and the geopolitical

01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:13.680
contingency of the material lives that we have then the easier it is psychologically to to deal with

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:22.320
um to deal with what is coming and that i think it though when it goes back you know

01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:27.920
i think it does matter how we choose to how we choose to live in these times i don't think

01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:34.560
there's any reason to say that because it's hard and there's so many um difficulties and

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:38.720
dangers ahead that that doesn't mean that we can't live our lives well

01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:45.440
and you're a teacher and i don't know how much uh in those two classes you're currently teaching

01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:52.560
you get to the depth of what the conversation we just had um but clearly your students are aware

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:58.720
of what's going on in the middle east and russia um and ukraine so what do you what advice do you

01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:04.400
give your students um at the end of the semester and and what advice would you give to young humans

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:13.440
listening to this episode i mean i don't tend to like advise um the students i have in the way

01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:19.920
that the Cambridge system like works i have about 25 students who i have a very direct

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:29.200
responsibility for like beyond um teaching um very interested in their lives and i try to engage

01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:36.560
with them about that i have a strong sense that it really matters what is passed from like one

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:45.440
generation to the next i'm very conscious of what my inheritances have been in that um respect

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:51.440
and i'm interested i suppose as much in trying to give something back to them in the way in which

01:50:51.440 --> 01:51:00.560
i think something was like given to me and that they then might like pass on um to i mean i do

01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:13.760
think i probably encourage them to to try to historicize the moment and to try to uh understand

01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:22.160
that um human beings have they've lived through some much harder times than even the ones that we

01:51:22.160 --> 01:51:29.040
get far harder and that they've survived and that the human spirit has like survived through

01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:32.480
that i mean i think about europe through the the black death

01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:46.640
century and that there are all kinds of good things in the future we may well not live to see

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:54.400
in this um respect but it's never if you look at human history just a story of permanent disaster

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:58.720
from which that there is no escape and i'm not saying that because i want to minimize any of

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:07.440
the catastrophes in the first part of the 20th century which quite quite um the contrary um

01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.000
but we don't have to well our own lives are concerned i don't think we don't have to be fatalistic

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:22.640
yep i agree let me ask you this it's my belief um that there's around 240 million college students

01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:30.000
in the world and i think humans in grad school particularly and postdocs are an incredible

01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:40.080
and underutilized natural resource um that we can have help tackling the systemic overview that

01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:47.280
that you and i have discussed um but within the current academy which is kind of part of the energy

01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:54.240
hungry superorganism and linear and business as usual i don't think the creativity is being

01:52:54.240 --> 01:53:03.440
directed towards its best use so in your field um political economy political science uh energy

01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:11.840
with an energy lens can you offer a few big questions that uh postdocs uh and such around

01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:18.880
the world listening to this program could be working on that need uh research and answers but

01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:25.360
might not be what's conventionally chosen i mean i think there's one here i really would

01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:33.600
pick and uh for political economy and that is the relationship between monetary history and energy

01:53:34.240 --> 01:53:45.120
history okay i mean i spent some time in um in disorder trying to think about that in relationship

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:52.080
to the end of dollar gold convertibility and in relation to the 2008 crash but the nature of

01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:58.400
the book meant that i was just scratching like at the surface i actually had an idea of trying

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:05.120
to do something more systematically about uh this myself including trying to think about the

01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:12.960
relationship between the the 1929 crash the end of the the gold standard the interwar gold standard

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:18.960
and changes in the energy world particularly the um return of the soviet union as a as an oil

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:28.160
export and i think there's there may be something um in that but i think that that gets as well at

01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:34.800
a question that i think that is really important beyond political economy and in some ways it goes

01:54:34.800 --> 01:54:41.760
to the heart of like the way in which economics is done academically which is this presumption

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:50.320
that actually we understand the economic world via a monetary lens rather than via an energy lens

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:56.000
and i think that once you bring the energy lens into political economy a lot of things start to look

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:05.760
quite different and so i think um a project which looked at the relationship between monetary

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:09.440
history and energy history through the entirety of the 20th century and maybe even going back to the

01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:18.240
origins of the of the gold standard in the in the in the 1870s would be very would be very revealing

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:27.200
and would have some significance beyond just the actual history in terms of trying to bring a more

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:32.960
well trying to you know move the dial away from a monetary focus to an energy focus and understanding

01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:41.840
the economic world okay thank you a couple closing questions helen what do you care most about in the

01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:51.760
world uh that's that is um that is a non-academic question yeah because it presumes a quite high

01:55:51.760 --> 01:56:03.440
level of self-awareness that one really knows what one does um care um about uh i mean in a

01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:11.600
personal sense i i'm i'm passionate about the pursuit of knowledge that's i'm very intellectually

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:24.320
curious that drives quite a lot of um of what i do um i'm also um very interested in

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:34.160
cultural and spiritual questions i don't think of this uh in terms of being focused on political

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:41.280
economy i don't think of that as being at odds with a more spiritual way of thinking about

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:47.120
the world i'd rather try and think both materially and um spiritually i mean beyond myself i'd go

01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.400
back in a way to the answer that i gave you know like earlier i mean i care very deeply about what

01:56:52.400 --> 01:57:00.560
is passed between the generations i feel very that inwardly quite strongly uh in terms of my own

01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:07.440
personal history but in tools also the fact that you know i've been working in a university as a

01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:18.240
educator for nearly three decades um now and that i find that it's very uh well it's just

01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:21.840
rewarding to i was going to say emotionally but that's not actually sufficient it's rewarding to

01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:28.080
me as a human being to do that and it's very important to me that i continue to do that

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:35.680
i fully agree uh i feel the same way and that is uh why i continue to do this podcast because

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:45.280
i think education is the single no regret strategy given what we face um to to uh pass the baton to

01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:51.360
the next generation as you say um if you uh and you i know you listen to my podcast so you know

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:57.040
what question i'm i'm about to ask if you had a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to

01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:02.960
your decision what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures

01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:13.520
i mean i thought about this quite hard and in one sense the easy answer i think given we're

01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:21.280
talking about energy would be to say the success of fusion so something that would that that would

01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:27.120
basically mean the human beings didn't have to think about energy in the same way that they could

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:32.560
take it like for for granted but they want to start to think about that i thought well actually

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:39.280
nobody's got any idea what it would mean to be a human being under conditions in which

01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:49.920
energy could just be like taken for granted maybe that just because for a couple of centuries

01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:57.280
certainly that energy is being fossil fuel energy drove such conflict between states that if we had

01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:01.280
an abundant energy didn't have to think about it maybe we would just do other find other ways of

01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:08.000
doing bad things because we wouldn't be constrained by energy so i kind of a little bit more would go

01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:15.840
with the uh making us all changing or having higher levels of self-awareness a consciousness thing

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:25.120
rather than the materials first thing uh more aware of our own um shared humanity more aware

01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:34.320
less selfish um consciousness more aware of our relationship to the uh to to the to the planet

01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:44.720
and i don't think obviously that's a fix in um any sense whatsoever um but i think that the

01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:52.000
world would be would be a better place that's a good wish

01:59:52.880 --> 02:00:00.640
um to be continued my friend thank you for your scholarship and your teaching and we'll be in touch
