00:00.000 --> 00:03.680
Bienvenue Ã  la grande simplification.

00:03.680 --> 00:09.120
I'd like to welcome to the show Jean-Marc Giancovici.

00:09.120 --> 00:13.600
Jean-Marc is a French engineering consultant, professor,

00:13.600 --> 00:16.160
author, and independent columnist.

00:16.160 --> 00:18.720
He is very well known in France.

00:18.720 --> 00:22.000
He's been working at the intersection of climate, energy,

00:22.000 --> 00:25.120
and economics for over 20 years.

00:25.120 --> 00:30.240
He's the co-founder and associate at the Carbone 4 consultancy firm,

00:30.240 --> 00:33.280
as well as the founding president of the Think Tank,

00:33.280 --> 00:35.280
the SHIFT project.

00:35.280 --> 00:41.360
This was a weird conversation because I have never watched until a few hours

00:41.360 --> 00:46.000
before this any of his work, and he's never watched any of my work.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.640
And we're saying almost the same things, which to me is a robust finding.

00:52.640 --> 00:55.760
And I hope to collaborate with Jean-Marc in the future.

00:55.760 --> 00:58.640
Please welcome Jean-Marc Giancovici.

01:10.560 --> 01:13.280
Jean-Marc, good to see you. Welcome to the program.

01:14.640 --> 01:15.200
Good morning.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.400
Oh, good afternoon. I just know.

01:17.920 --> 01:20.640
It is almost, almost afternoon here.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.160
You are seven hours ahead of me.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.760
So you and I have been sharing similar stories and viewpoints.

01:28.480 --> 01:31.360
From what I understand, the past two decades,

01:31.360 --> 01:33.680
a lot of people have told me about your work.

01:33.680 --> 01:37.840
It was only this morning that I watched one of your English videos.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.760
So could you start us off by, in your own words,

01:42.400 --> 01:48.160
give us kind of a long elevator pitch of how you see the human situation

01:48.160 --> 01:53.280
with respect to energy, climate, systems, oil depletion, etc.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.560
What's the big picture?

01:54.560 --> 01:58.480
Well, actually, the big picture goes back to two centuries in rough figures.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.560
The reason why we're today able to talk together,

02:03.280 --> 02:05.760
even though we are thousands of miles apart,

02:07.120 --> 02:11.120
and we all have a computer, and we all have plenty of food to eat,

02:11.120 --> 02:13.360
and we all have a big house, and we all have

02:13.680 --> 02:19.200
a means to move around, for actually not a lot of money,

02:20.240 --> 02:21.360
is called fossil fuels.

02:22.400 --> 02:25.200
What happened to humanity for the last two centuries

02:25.200 --> 02:28.720
is that thanks to fossil fuels and thanks to machines

02:28.720 --> 02:31.360
that were put in motion by these fossil fuels,

02:31.360 --> 02:37.760
we have progressively replaced hard human labor by easy,

02:37.760 --> 02:41.280
so to say human labor, which consists in giving orders to machines,

02:42.240 --> 02:44.480
that plant and harvest the crops for us,

02:46.960 --> 02:50.000
plant and harvest cotton and need clothes for us.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.560
We have machines that move us around, manufacture the billions of goods

02:56.560 --> 02:58.960
that we can now purchase in stores.

03:00.000 --> 03:05.440
We have all these machines that fly, sail, move around, etc.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.320
We have the machines that build our homes, etc.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.040
Basically, we live in a world of machines,

03:11.600 --> 03:16.480
and the conclusion to which I've come, I would say,

03:16.480 --> 03:21.520
during the last 20 years, is that what freed the 19th and 20th centuries

03:23.200 --> 03:26.640
actually bears a very simple name, coal, oil and gas,

03:26.640 --> 03:29.840
and the internal combustion engine and the steam machine.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.120
Basically, that's what happened to humanity for the last two centuries.

03:34.080 --> 03:37.280
Thanks to our thanks, or no thanks, I don't know, to fossil fuels,

03:38.240 --> 03:42.640
the number of people on earth grew from 1 billion to 8 billion.

03:42.640 --> 03:49.200
Life expectancy at birth went from, let's say, a little bit under 30 in 1800

03:49.200 --> 03:53.760
to the world average is probably around 65 today.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.080
Even in India, life expectancy at birth is over 70,

03:59.360 --> 04:05.520
so we have, again, all the material goods that we have today

04:06.240 --> 04:07.520
is due to fossil fuels.

04:08.320 --> 04:16.000
This has also framed the geography and, I would say, settlements of people,

04:17.200 --> 04:22.240
as it is no longer necessary to have people in the fields growing fruit.

04:23.040 --> 04:28.960
We have progressively shifted to industrial, then office jobs,

04:28.960 --> 04:34.720
or tertiary jobs, so to say, that we have in cities.

04:35.520 --> 04:42.240
We progressively went to a type of settlement where most people live in cities,

04:42.240 --> 04:44.560
and actually you can observe that everywhere in the world,

04:44.560 --> 04:47.760
the more energy per capita you have and the more people live in cities.

04:51.680 --> 04:59.680
The modern urban world with people working in offices or in commercial buildings,

05:00.640 --> 05:07.680
living at home and owning a car is basically the way of living that you have everywhere

05:08.720 --> 05:10.640
when abundant energy comes in.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.200
It's basically what happened everywhere.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.960
And, of course, this comes with the price.

05:18.240 --> 05:24.160
Actually, the first price that it comes with is that all these fossil fuels have changed the

05:24.240 --> 05:29.920
composition of the atmosphere through their burning, and it has increased a natural effect

05:29.920 --> 05:35.840
called the greenhouse effect that was discovered by a French two centuries ago, Joseph Fourier,

05:36.640 --> 05:37.840
in 1824.

05:38.960 --> 05:45.520
And this greenhouse effect is being increased or enhanced by all the extra CO2 that we pour

05:45.520 --> 05:49.840
into the atmosphere, knowing that the CO2 is a very stable molecule because it's an oxide,

05:49.840 --> 05:52.400
and oxides are very stable chemical compounds.

05:53.360 --> 05:58.640
And it leads to a change of the climate system, a climate drift, so to say,

05:59.600 --> 06:01.600
which is going to be an increasing burden.

06:02.640 --> 06:08.400
And the other price that we have to pay is that all this, I would say, industrial civilization

06:09.680 --> 06:17.440
rests on non-renewable resources that we have to use and destroy when we use them

06:17.680 --> 06:23.760
more and more, fossil fuels, they need, we destroy them when we use them, but also metals.

06:24.320 --> 06:29.040
Today, our modern civilization needs all the metals that we have found on Earth.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.760
The computer that I'm using right now and that you are using right now needs 40 to 60 different

06:35.760 --> 06:37.040
metals to be manufactured.

06:37.040 --> 06:49.520
So the civilization that we have built is increasingly complex and dependent on

06:49.520 --> 06:51.760
non-natural resources that can be depleted.

06:53.360 --> 06:58.640
So the two main challenges, I would say, the two main global limits that we face today

06:58.640 --> 07:04.160
is a global limit regarding the environment that cannot accept all the waste that we pour

07:04.160 --> 07:12.560
into it, CO2 being one of it, being one of the, I would say, the best documented and addressed

07:12.560 --> 07:22.000
today, but there are many more, and an upstream bottleneck on non-renewable resources that we

07:22.000 --> 07:23.440
would like to have more and more.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.360
And it's not sure that we will have more.

07:26.000 --> 07:30.080
Actually regarding oil, it's almost sure that we will not have more and more.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.920
And in a couple of years, we will have less and less.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.840
Globally speaking, in the world.

07:35.520 --> 07:36.960
So that's the challenge we address.

07:37.520 --> 07:42.720
And one of the difficulties that comes with it is that very few people understand the challenge

07:43.360 --> 07:48.480
because it is not something that you can get through the most common indicator that we use

07:49.920 --> 07:51.200
every day, which is money.

07:52.640 --> 08:00.240
The challenge that I just evoked is not embedded into current prices because basically

08:00.240 --> 08:01.840
natural assets have no price.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.640
And so we cannot realize that there is a challenge through prices.

08:07.760 --> 08:12.560
But it happens that the only quantitative indicator that we use every day is money.

08:14.800 --> 08:16.720
You don't take your block pressure every day.

08:16.720 --> 08:20.320
You don't measure the amount of CO2 that you put into the air every day.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.600
You don't measure the mass of copper that you use every day.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.920
I mean, the only thing that you count every day is money, basically.

08:26.880 --> 08:31.840
And so the difficulty is that as the challenge is not embedded into prices,

08:33.120 --> 08:40.000
it is very difficult for people that have not devoted their life to studying the challenge,

08:40.000 --> 08:43.840
as I have done, to understand it easily.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.720
Magnifique, that was a better summary than I've ever done, I think,

08:48.720 --> 08:50.480
even though we're telling the same story.

08:51.040 --> 08:56.640
When was your red pill moment, Jean-Marc, when you first realized how central that

08:56.640 --> 09:03.520
energy was to the entire civilization and our expectations and everything?

09:03.520 --> 09:06.320
Actually, I had a collection of red pills, of small red pills.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.440
My first red pill was when I realized the magnitude of the challenge regarding climate change.

09:14.960 --> 09:19.280
Actually, historically, I came to climate change before coming to energy.

09:21.040 --> 09:28.560
The way I got my revelation, so to say, is that at the end of the 90s,

09:29.680 --> 09:38.480
I was working in the telecommunication sector, and it was the time where the operators were

09:38.480 --> 09:41.600
very excited by the idea of developing remote activities.

09:41.600 --> 09:47.680
It was the beginning of telework, remote learning, and all these things.

09:48.640 --> 09:54.960
And I was as a basic consultant during business plans for the main French operator

09:54.960 --> 09:59.040
in telecommunications, Orange, today, at the time it was France Telecom,

10:00.720 --> 10:04.640
and studying the fact, well, looking at the fact that

10:06.160 --> 10:12.560
home offices could spare people moving or could spare car commuting.

10:12.880 --> 10:21.360
I came across the word greenhouse gases, and I asked myself, what is that?

10:22.560 --> 10:26.080
So I began looking, so that was my first red pill moment.

10:26.880 --> 10:31.600
I understood that we were changing the composition of the atmosphere, and that it could,

10:32.320 --> 10:36.480
I would say, trigger a change of climate era in one century.

10:37.440 --> 10:42.400
Whereas in the past, it was done in 10,000 years with people able to move around,

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
which is not the case today, because we have settled.

10:46.800 --> 10:55.600
My second red pill moment was when I tried to understand what was causing this,

10:55.600 --> 11:00.400
and the link between the way we live and energy.

11:01.040 --> 11:05.360
And my second red pill moment was when I realized that actually,

11:05.360 --> 11:14.080
energy or the increase of energy supply had been the main driver over a century, say,

11:15.360 --> 11:17.440
that frayed all the countries in the world.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.200
Basically, you give machines to a country, and the evolution is always the same.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.560
People leave the fields, go to factories, then to sit, then to offices,

11:27.120 --> 11:28.080
live in cities.

11:28.080 --> 11:31.760
They are purchasing power increases, they get retirement, they get long studies,

11:31.760 --> 11:36.560
they get vacations, they get their weekends, they work less in the week, they vote.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.840
I mean, everything came in with energy.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.560
And that was my second red pill moment, because then I asked myself,

11:45.760 --> 11:50.000
where will the world go the day we have less and less energy?

11:50.720 --> 11:56.000
Will we keep democracies, or will we have rights everywhere and social unrest?

11:57.120 --> 11:59.840
Which is unfortunately happening here and there more and more.

12:01.680 --> 12:06.480
Will we keep peace, or is something that won't happen?

12:06.480 --> 12:14.480
How are we going to, in a way, become sober without the whole society collapsing?

12:17.280 --> 12:23.520
I still haven't the complete answer, but that was my second red pill moment.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.760
Then I had another red pill moment when I realized the way democracies operate.

12:29.360 --> 12:34.560
And I realized that a fast reaction to that issue would not happen.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.640
That was, I would say, a third red pill moment.

12:38.640 --> 12:43.040
So I had at least three, and maybe through our discussion, I will discover that I have more.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.320
Yeah, the room is full of red pills.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.360
We actually have so much in common on how we see this.

12:49.920 --> 12:55.280
So if I was an economist or a world leader listening to your summary,

12:56.160 --> 13:03.680
I might say, yes, but it's technology that caused all the increase in population and the increase in

13:04.240 --> 13:09.760
wealth and services and the increase in city and retirement and vacation.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.760
It's human innovation that caused it.

13:12.720 --> 13:15.520
Do you encounter that pushback, and how do you respond to it?

13:15.840 --> 13:24.480
Well, it's an easy answer, because actually, to spread technology, you basically have to spread the

13:24.480 --> 13:27.200
objects that embed the technology.

13:27.200 --> 13:33.680
So you have to manufacture plenty of objects, and manufacturing plenty of objects per the name,

13:33.680 --> 13:39.040
which is energy, because you need plenty of energy into the industrial system.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.240
I can put it the other way around.

13:42.240 --> 13:46.720
Tomorrow morning, you don't have much energy, and you can't manufacture cars anymore.

13:47.920 --> 13:52.720
Even if you have brilliant engineers, how do you spread technical progress in cars?

13:52.720 --> 13:55.120
If you can't manufacture cars, obviously you can't.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.800
And if you can't manufacture cars that people can't use, because there is no energy to use the cars,

14:00.800 --> 14:03.840
how do you spread technical progress in cars?

14:03.840 --> 14:04.240
You can't.

14:04.880 --> 14:11.360
So it's very easy to explain that actually spreading technical, finding something which is new

14:11.360 --> 14:12.560
doesn't require much energy.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.360
Actually, it requires a little energy, because it requires free time.

14:16.800 --> 14:24.400
In the Middle Ages, people were busy feeling themselves, because it's the first need of humanity.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.160
And once the day was over, and they had worked all day to feed themselves,

14:28.160 --> 14:33.040
they had no spare time to find whatever the proton, or the neutron, or the electron,

14:34.240 --> 14:38.720
or the way to conceive the electric energy.

14:39.040 --> 14:46.640
One of the reasons why we have plenty of researchers today able to, and Mr. Musk and

14:46.640 --> 14:51.360
hire plenty of engineers, is that precisely machines are growing the food for us.

14:52.000 --> 14:56.000
If we're a busy harvesting potatoes, we wouldn't do any research.

14:56.800 --> 14:58.320
Wouldn't have the time to do so.

14:58.320 --> 15:03.840
When you look at countries that are still very sober regarding their energy consumption in Africa,

15:03.840 --> 15:07.920
for example, they do not have many engineers, and they don't have many researchers.

15:08.560 --> 15:14.960
So it's also the result of abundant energy that we can have research and technology.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.880
But to spread, again, technology, we need plenty of energy,

15:18.880 --> 15:20.880
because we need to manufacture plenty of objects.

15:21.520 --> 15:29.280
So there are a lot of very ambitious technological plans in the future,

15:29.280 --> 15:39.040
such as net zero. And there are promises of decoupling or dematerializing GDP from energy

15:39.040 --> 15:42.240
and materials. What are your thoughts on that?

15:42.880 --> 15:50.800
So far, it never happened. Actually, 15 years ago, I began doing something very simple,

15:52.000 --> 15:56.640
which is plotting the world GDP against the world energy consumption.

15:57.600 --> 16:04.560
I've got data going up to 1965, and I was astonished to discover that I got almost a

16:04.560 --> 16:10.640
straight line. So when you plot the world GDP in constant dollars against the world energy

16:10.640 --> 16:15.120
consumption, which is actually the size of the active fleet of machines in the world,

16:15.120 --> 16:19.360
that's what the energy consumption is, you get almost a straight line,

16:19.360 --> 16:22.640
you have a little improvement of the energy efficiency every year.

16:22.640 --> 16:26.640
So actually, it's not exactly a straight line, something which is slightly convex,

16:27.680 --> 16:33.040
but you get almost a straight line. And the reason why is very simple, actually,

16:33.040 --> 16:39.360
to have as long as the GDP counts the same thing, that is square feet of construction,

16:42.080 --> 16:48.320
goods moving around, goods being manufactured, number of ships operating in the world, etc.

16:48.320 --> 16:55.200
You have physical things. And in the physical world, you have rules that you cannot,

16:55.200 --> 16:59.920
sorry for the repetition, overrule. I mean, like for example, to put a mass in motion,

16:59.920 --> 17:07.440
you require a minimum energy, which is the mass times the square of the speed times one half.

17:08.400 --> 17:13.600
And you cannot say it's one quarter, because it would be, I would save energy if it were one

17:13.600 --> 17:17.120
quarter. So I'm going to vote at the Congress that it's one quarter, you can't do that.

17:18.080 --> 17:26.640
It's always one half. So you have limits, you can near the limit, but you cannot overcome it.

17:27.680 --> 17:35.760
I'm going to take another example. To go from iron ore to iron, you have to remove the oxygen

17:35.760 --> 17:42.720
in the iron ore. Actually, iron ore is an iron oxide. The most common molecule in iron ore is

17:42.720 --> 17:51.040
two atoms of iron for three atoms of oxygen. To remove the oxygen, you use carbon, coal,

17:51.040 --> 17:59.040
actually, metallurgical coal. You need 1.5 atom of carbon to remove the three atoms of oxygen,

17:59.040 --> 18:05.600
and it will never be one, and it will never be 0.8. It will always be 1.5. So in the physical

18:05.600 --> 18:11.280
world, you have physical limits. And it's the reason why when you look at the energy consumption

18:11.280 --> 18:17.440
per physical unit, per kilogram of steel, per kilogram of copper, the improvement actually

18:17.440 --> 18:22.960
is very low. It's very slow. It doesn't go fast, and you have an absolute limit that you cannot

18:22.960 --> 18:31.920
overcome. So in the future, we might even degrade the energy efficiency of the industry,

18:31.920 --> 18:37.680
because the concentration of copper in the copper ore, for example, decreases with time,

18:37.680 --> 18:42.720
which means that you need more and more energy to get 1 kilogram of copper. And so at the

18:42.720 --> 18:47.600
certain point with time, you will not have an improvement of the energy efficiency of mining

18:47.600 --> 18:52.240
copper, but you will have a degradation of the energy efficiency of mining copper.

18:53.280 --> 19:00.800
So but again, when you look at the past, you have there is no decoupling at the world level.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.840
You have a slight decoupling in some given countries, but that's thanks to trade,

19:06.480 --> 19:13.040
because you have the added value in the country, and the industrial process that or the physical

19:13.040 --> 19:19.280
flow that provides this added value, which is outside the country. So it's an illusion. When

19:19.280 --> 19:23.760
you look at the world as a whole, you have no decoupling in the past, and there is no major

19:23.760 --> 19:28.880
reason that you can get a decoupling in the future. Jean-Marc, have you ever watched one of my lectures

19:28.880 --> 19:39.200
or any of my videos? I confess that I have not done so recently. Well, then I'm very happy,

19:39.200 --> 19:45.040
because you are telling my story, and we've never met and never watched each other's videos,

19:45.040 --> 19:50.400
which means the story is robust. I feel like I found a brother from another mother. I mean,

19:50.400 --> 19:57.360
I say these same things over independent research for the last 20 years. And I just

19:57.440 --> 20:06.320
question why it is that so few people have connected these dots. And I suspect that one

20:06.320 --> 20:12.480
reason is that the total, as you said earlier, the total amount of energy available to society

20:12.480 --> 20:20.560
is increased every year, and that is hiding all of the future assumptions and plans just

20:20.560 --> 20:28.960
implicitly assume that will continue. So they miss the centrality of energy abundant and cheap

20:28.960 --> 20:34.560
are contributing to our society. Why do you think you and I and many others have been

20:35.200 --> 20:40.480
talking about this for 20 years, and it is still not, well, maybe in France it has, but

20:40.480 --> 20:48.000
elsewhere in the world, this is still a narrative of technology and money. And energy materials

20:48.000 --> 20:55.840
are out in the distance in the explanatory stories. You're geographically closer to the answer than I

20:55.840 --> 21:02.400
am. I believe that it's a consequence of the University of Chicago. That's where I went to

21:02.400 --> 21:12.320
graduate school. Yeah, okay. Basically, it goes back to what I said earlier. Many people in the

21:12.400 --> 21:18.640
economic world believe that physical constraints are embedded into prices. And one of the things

21:18.640 --> 21:24.400
that they believe is that there is an elasticity between prices and volumes. So that if you near

21:24.400 --> 21:30.320
a limit, you will see it into prices. And if you don't see anything into prices is that you are far

21:30.320 --> 21:36.160
from the limits. I will explain in a couple of seconds why it is false for commodities that are

21:36.160 --> 21:42.640
essential to our modern economy. For oil or steel, for example, it is false. I can explain that

21:42.640 --> 21:50.720
very easily. There is no elasticity. And that's one of the reasons why. Of course, and it goes back

21:50.720 --> 21:55.600
to framing. Actually, it's not the fault of the University of Chicago because before that it was

21:55.600 --> 22:02.880
the fault of French and English thinkers, earlier thinkers, early thinkers, sorry, of the classical

22:02.880 --> 22:09.680
economy. Two centuries ago, basically, the classical economist said, in the world, we are

22:09.680 --> 22:16.880
going to count what is the limiting factor of production, which is the economic science. Basically,

22:16.880 --> 22:22.880
it is addressing the limiting factors of production. And at the time, two centuries ago,

22:23.600 --> 22:30.080
basically, the economy was still a lot centered on agriculture. There was a little industry,

22:30.080 --> 22:37.120
but basically. And what they said is that there is plenty of land, plenty of resources. We don't

22:37.120 --> 22:43.920
lack iron ore. We don't lack coal. The only thing that we can lack is human labor and human capital.

22:44.640 --> 22:50.720
So the only thing that we are going to count is human labor, which is a way, a kind of energy,

22:51.280 --> 22:59.520
but it's a slight part of the energy that we can get. And human capital, which is also a limiting

22:59.520 --> 23:07.120
factor, but there are plenty other limiting factors among natural capital. If you are a fisherman,

23:08.160 --> 23:13.600
you need a natural capital, which is fish. You don't only need human capital, which is a boat,

23:14.800 --> 23:20.400
and you don't need only sailors. You also need, particularly if you're a modern fisherman,

23:21.440 --> 23:27.920
a little oil or a little diesel oil to put into the engine. So basically, and what they have done

23:27.920 --> 23:33.760
is that they have invented that technological progress, which is, for example, the solo residue

23:33.760 --> 23:42.560
in Solo's vision, which is the total productivity of factor. If you look at Copto Glass, etc.

23:42.560 --> 23:49.200
So they invented that term, which cannot be predicted, which can only explain,

23:49.200 --> 23:55.680
exhaust what happened, which is fantastic, which was called technological progress. And which,

23:55.680 --> 24:01.040
actually, when you look carefully at things, is energy machines and natural resources. That's

24:01.040 --> 24:07.920
what actually it is. But as it is not explicit, people stick to prices, and they believe that

24:07.920 --> 24:13.840
with prices, you can explain all what happens to the productive system. Now, why is it false that

24:13.840 --> 24:19.440
we have no elasticity between prices and volumes regarding oil or steel, for example? It's because

24:19.440 --> 24:25.200
these commodities are essential to modern economy. If you produce less oil in the world, if you have

24:25.200 --> 24:31.600
less oil, you will have less cars, less trucks, less planes, and less boats that can operate.

24:31.600 --> 24:38.480
Therefore, your economy will shrink a little. And if the economy shrinks a little, people earn less,

24:38.480 --> 24:44.080
because basically, the revenues are equal to the production. That's basic macroeconomic

24:44.080 --> 24:49.920
formula. So if people earn less and have less money, and you have less oil to offer them,

24:49.920 --> 24:55.760
you don't know whether the new equilibrium price of oil will be higher or lower than the former

24:55.760 --> 25:00.560
price. And actually, when you look at past prices, there is no clear relationship.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.480
With less oil, you can have prices that are lower, prices that are higher, you can get everything.

25:07.120 --> 25:12.160
Same thing for steel. The modern world fully relies on steel. If you have less steel,

25:12.160 --> 25:17.200
it's an essential commodity for the economy. So if you produce less steel, you will destroy

25:17.200 --> 25:24.000
a little part of the economy. Therefore, producing less, people earn less, and then again, the new

25:24.000 --> 25:29.600
equilibrium price of steel has no reason to be higher or lower than the previous one. So there

25:29.600 --> 25:35.600
is no elasticity between prices and volumes for communities that are essential to the functioning

25:35.600 --> 25:40.560
of the economy. If you take a commodity which is non-essential, like handbags, for example,

25:41.280 --> 25:45.920
if you produce less handbags, of course, it will not destroy the economy. You have this,

25:45.920 --> 25:50.480
people have the same purchasing power, only you have less handbags. And so the price of the handbag

25:50.480 --> 25:59.760
goes up. So that's okay. But this relationship, it doesn't apply to commodities that are essential

25:59.760 --> 26:09.760
to framing the modern economy. Which is why, for example, you won't see oil depletion coming through

26:09.760 --> 26:16.880
oil prices going forever up. You will see them with GDP going forever down.

26:17.920 --> 26:25.600
That's the way you will see it. But nominal prices. And today, as economists have never looked at the

26:25.600 --> 26:32.640
relationship between energy and GDP, when the GDP goes down, it's the fault of bankers, people that

26:32.640 --> 26:38.640
don't want to work, lazy, whatever, but they never see energy in the picture.

26:40.560 --> 26:48.000
So there's a biophysically economist who used to be on our advisory board called Reiner Kumo,

26:48.640 --> 26:58.880
who explained the solo residual is almost all energy. And I think if we did it on a global

26:58.880 --> 27:05.040
basis, it would be like over 90% of it. I think his numbers were 60 some percent. But yeah,

27:07.520 --> 27:14.560
excellent. So what are your thoughts? You mentioned money and GDP. What are your opinions on finance

27:15.200 --> 27:21.920
and quantitative easing as adding false or temporary wealth to the economy in the last couple

27:21.920 --> 27:28.160
decades? And how does that affect some people's claims that we're decoupling energy from GDP?

27:30.080 --> 27:34.640
I am not an expert on quantitative easing, but one of the conclusions that I've come to

27:34.640 --> 27:41.920
is that it led to an inflation of assets. Actually, there is an old theory that says that when you

27:41.920 --> 27:48.880
create money in excess, compared to the physical possibilities of the economy to produce something,

27:49.520 --> 27:56.880
it leads to inflation. Actually, what happened during the last 20 years is that creating money

27:57.520 --> 28:06.960
didn't lead to inflation in common goods, but it led to inflation in assets, real estate, stocks, etc.

28:07.920 --> 28:13.280
So that's what happened basically. And that inflation of assets is not fully corrected

28:14.240 --> 28:21.280
in deflating all that you count in the GDP. For example, if you have a square meter, sorry,

28:21.280 --> 28:29.360
a square foot in a building, which costs twice the price, you will need a mortgage,

28:29.360 --> 28:37.200
which is twice the amount. And you will count the production in banks as twice the previous

28:37.200 --> 28:42.560
production. You will not deflate that production on the basis that it's always a square foot

28:43.520 --> 28:48.640
it is physically still the same goods, only costs twice the price. And so you have no reason

28:49.360 --> 28:58.080
to count twice the bank added value. And you have that same thing for the stock market.

28:59.040 --> 29:05.760
If stocks go up, you will not deflate that saying, okay, it's always a stock, it's always the same

29:05.760 --> 29:12.240
company. There is no reason to count it for twice or 10 times the price. And I have never

29:12.240 --> 29:17.760
had the opportunity to make precise calculations to see what would have,

29:18.880 --> 29:25.520
how the GDP would have evolved if we had discounted, so to say, the inflation of assets

29:25.520 --> 29:30.480
from the GDP. But my belief is that it would have removed something, a little something.

29:30.480 --> 29:35.360
And the other thing that we should have removed from the GDP basically is the debt,

29:35.360 --> 29:41.920
because if you increase the GDP that you count today, through increasing the debt that you

29:41.920 --> 29:52.480
have to reimburse tomorrow, normally, you should have an accounting closer to a certain liability

29:52.480 --> 29:59.600
accounting than to a P&L accounting, which is what we do. So you should count something for

29:59.600 --> 30:06.720
the creation of debt that you should deduct from today's GDP. And that correction also has never

30:06.720 --> 30:11.760
been made. And the level of debt has never been as high, well, actually for the last century,

30:11.760 --> 30:18.720
I mean, it's never been as high as today. Except for the Second World War.

30:18.720 --> 30:25.520
It's even higher than that now as a percentage. But all that debt, Jean-Marc, when it's called in,

30:25.520 --> 30:31.680
when it's created to be paid down, is a claim on energy. So all the debts that exist in the

30:31.680 --> 30:36.400
world when they're eventually paid down, and we don't have that amount of energy. So I think

30:36.880 --> 30:42.720
this one piece alone is being completely missed by the financial markets, in my opinion.

30:43.360 --> 30:47.120
Well, my belief is that it will end through inflation or default,

30:48.160 --> 30:54.640
or a mixture of the two. I, of course, have a preference for inflation because it's softer.

30:56.240 --> 31:02.640
But obviously, we are building a kind of policy pyramid, and we all know how it ends.

31:03.520 --> 31:09.760
But I agree. If you need extra GDP in the future to reimburse the debt, it means that you need

31:09.760 --> 31:17.280
extra energy. And you don't see how it fits if we have less and less energy in the future.

31:18.400 --> 31:24.000
So temporarily, we can print more money, which is a facsimile for more energy,

31:24.000 --> 31:27.040
but it just extracts the existing energy we have faster.

31:27.840 --> 31:35.120
I am not sure that it had a major effect on extraction of energy. It did have,

31:35.120 --> 31:47.760
in the US, a significant effect on the sharehold industry, because during between 2010 and 2018,

31:48.480 --> 31:56.000
during the share boom, as you probably know, share operators didn't earn a single back.

31:57.040 --> 32:03.840
Actually, they were all losing money. And they were also building a kind of policy pyramid.

32:04.880 --> 32:11.920
They were burning cash and refinancing themselves with new stock and new debt.

32:13.680 --> 32:20.080
Until one year before COVID, the financial sector said, now, now, end of the game,

32:21.040 --> 32:25.920
we want our money back. And actually, the only way to get the money back is to stop drilling all

32:25.920 --> 32:33.600
the time. Because with drilling all the time, you have huge capex and you just burn cash,

32:33.600 --> 32:39.840
I mean, you cannot earn money. And the paradox of sharehold is that you can earn money only if you

32:39.840 --> 32:45.520
do not increase production too fast, or if you do not increase it at all. But quantitative easing

32:46.400 --> 32:55.520
did favor that movement, the extraction of sharehold. It did have an effect.

32:55.520 --> 33:00.960
But after shale oil, there's nothing left except for oil shale, which is basically uncooked

33:01.680 --> 33:07.760
rock with oil in it. So this is, that's not going to work.

33:07.760 --> 33:16.000
Sorry, at the SHIP project, which is an NGO that I chair in France, we have done a thorough analysis

33:17.040 --> 33:22.320
with the data coming from Reichstadt Energy. We had access to the full database of all the

33:22.320 --> 33:28.880
oil fields in the world for a very minimum price. And we published, I think there was an English

33:28.880 --> 33:38.880
version, our research on the projections that we make only under geological constraints,

33:38.880 --> 33:44.400
we do not mention above ground constraints, political pressure, climate, whatever.

33:45.040 --> 33:52.720
On the perspective of the 16 top suppliers of Europe, that includes US,

33:53.440 --> 33:58.720
which happened to be the 16 top producers in the world except Canada, which is a significant one,

33:58.720 --> 34:05.040
and Brazil. And the result of our work is that the production, the combined production of these

34:05.040 --> 34:13.200
16 countries should be divided by two between now and 2015, including sharehold and including

34:13.200 --> 34:25.360
Tassen. So 27 years from now, cut in half. By 2050, the combined production of these 16

34:25.360 --> 34:35.600
top suppliers of Europe, which includes all the Middle East, Russia, all the US, Mexico,

34:37.760 --> 34:42.480
all the 16 top producers in the world, but Canada and Brazil, the production should be

34:42.480 --> 34:50.640
divided by two, including sharehold. That's almost best case, unless there's some new technology,

34:51.280 --> 34:57.840
because it doesn't account for geopolitics or climate inability to get water to process the

34:58.400 --> 35:05.200
mining or any any other complexity problems or things like that. I would say it's a no crisis

35:05.200 --> 35:11.200
scenario. Yeah, I think that's plausible. I would expect my numbers might be a little bit higher,

35:11.200 --> 35:19.280
but in that ballpark. So on that note, Jean-Marc, my personal stance, and I expect you would agree

35:19.280 --> 35:26.560
that on a grand scale, climate change is the most existential issue that humanity faces this century.

35:27.840 --> 35:33.520
However, you and I both believe that fossils are going to become economically unavailable

35:33.520 --> 35:39.280
sooner than our cultures are planning for. That eliminates a lot of the more extreme

35:39.280 --> 35:44.000
climate scenarios that some reports predict. What are your thoughts on that?

35:44.720 --> 35:52.960
What it excludes in my view is the most extreme temperature increase coming from greenhouse gases,

35:54.400 --> 36:02.880
but it doesn't exclude consequences much more unpleasant than what we today believe,

36:03.680 --> 36:10.240
coming from the scenarios that remain plausible with the amount of fossil fuels that we can access

36:11.120 --> 36:18.880
if I develop a little bit. I do believe that the higher end of the bracket regarding scenarios,

36:18.880 --> 36:26.160
which is emissions, growing and growing during the 21st century is plausible, because my belief is

36:26.160 --> 36:33.360
that we will experience some kind of slow collapse before the end of the century, preventing the

36:33.360 --> 36:40.960
economy from growing and so preventing emissions from growing. So the scenario which is a healthy

36:40.960 --> 36:50.400
economy and healthier and healthier economy becoming bigger and bigger until 2100 and

36:50.400 --> 36:55.360
powered by fossil fuels is something that I don't believe possible. I don't deem it is physically

36:55.360 --> 37:08.320
possible. What is possible is that we get a peak fossil sometime around 2050, 2060 or so,

37:09.760 --> 37:18.640
but that would be enough to trigger a three degrees plus scenario. What I want to elaborate

37:18.640 --> 37:24.720
is that the consequences of a three degrees plus scenario might be much, much more ample

37:25.360 --> 37:32.720
than what we believe today, because there are plenty of processes with threshold effects

37:32.720 --> 37:39.280
in the world, and basically we discovered them when it's too late. I will give a couple of

37:39.280 --> 37:45.520
examples. 10 years ago, I had never heard of the possible collapse of the western Antarctic ice

37:45.520 --> 37:54.720
sheet, which is today considered possible, starting from 1.5 degrees of global warming.

37:56.000 --> 38:01.760
10 years ago, I had not heard of the possible complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet

38:01.760 --> 38:07.040
in a couple of centuries, of course, which is something which is today considered possible,

38:07.040 --> 38:16.240
not certain, but possible. 10 years ago, I had not heard of the possibility of the whole Amazon

38:16.240 --> 38:23.600
forest turning into a dry forest or even a savannah, which is something which is today

38:23.600 --> 38:31.520
considered possible, et cetera, et cetera. Basically, and I remember that 20 years ago,

38:32.320 --> 38:42.640
I did some kind of TV show in France, and we elaborated a false weather forecast for

38:42.640 --> 38:52.240
2019, and the temperature that we mentioned was 40 degrees Celsius, which is something that we get

38:52.240 --> 39:01.120
today each summer in France. Basically, my belief is that we should not be reassured

39:01.840 --> 39:09.120
by that. The higher end of the warming is not possible, but the higher end of the consequences

39:09.120 --> 39:17.040
that we get for a given warming today will be overcome. The reason why is that the models

39:17.120 --> 39:21.760
that go from a global temperature increase to the consequences in a given sector,

39:22.800 --> 39:30.320
being the possible dismantling of an ice cap, or the evolution of yields regarding maize or rise,

39:31.200 --> 39:38.720
are models that are built with the past variability, and they do not embed the

39:38.720 --> 39:44.000
possible future of variability. And some recent research has been published in nature

39:44.000 --> 39:50.880
saying that if we increased a lot the variability in the future of climate parameters,

39:51.680 --> 39:56.160
we get damage which is much, much higher, but if we do not do that.

39:56.720 --> 40:01.680
I totally agree with you. Yeah, we don't have enough to meet the high threshold,

40:01.680 --> 40:08.640
but we have plenty to have a disaster in the climate. So I have so many questions for you.

40:08.640 --> 40:14.640
Let me just keep firing because you are giving succinct and very articulate answers,

40:14.640 --> 40:17.760
not in your native language, by the way, so thank you for that.

40:19.760 --> 40:27.280
So a main news story in France, kind of ongoing, has been protests and unrest over the raising of

40:27.280 --> 40:33.760
the retirement age and the threshold for pension fund access. Do you think that this connects back

40:33.760 --> 40:39.200
to energy scarcity, and do you think we'll have more of this type of response, or do the French

40:39.200 --> 40:47.200
just have a certain proclivity for civil unrest? Well, without the two. We like to complain,

40:48.000 --> 40:58.480
which is a national sport here, to complain, but the fact is that we today have retirement

40:59.040 --> 41:03.600
thanks to abundant energy. I mean, two centuries ago, there was no retirement.

41:04.400 --> 41:10.880
Actually, it's not true. Retirement was invented by Colbert four centuries ago,

41:11.520 --> 41:18.720
and he did that for the Royal Navy. And at the time, there were 20,000 sailors,

41:18.720 --> 41:25.360
and you could get retirement when you turn 60, and believe me, in 1600 something,

41:26.240 --> 41:30.880
turning 60, which means surviving Scorbert and adverse fire.

41:32.880 --> 41:36.960
I mean, he didn't make a major risk with the budget, our friend Colbert.

41:39.680 --> 41:47.600
But thanks to energy now, we have so much production given by machines that we can feed

41:47.600 --> 41:54.800
and provide clothes and housing and cars and everything to people that work, in quote,

41:54.800 --> 41:59.520
which is giving orders to machines today, working, and people that do not work,

41:59.520 --> 42:03.760
but some of them physically do exactly the same thing. You see, for example, today,

42:03.760 --> 42:08.640
I'm supposed to work. I'm a consultant, I'm sitting behind an office, and I work. What is

42:08.640 --> 42:15.360
working for me talking to you? Is that work? It is not work. I mean, if I, if in a couple of hours,

42:15.360 --> 42:19.360
I will talk to somebody else doing exactly the same thing, sitting on a chair,

42:19.360 --> 42:23.840
will not, will not be through a computer, and it will not be work. It will be later. I mean,

42:23.840 --> 42:28.320
what is the difference in physical terms? No difference. So what we call work today

42:28.320 --> 42:33.760
for plenty of people is something that middle-aged peasants would have called leisure,

42:34.560 --> 42:40.720
sitting on a chair and talking, or sitting on a chair and typing on the, on the, on the, on the

42:40.720 --> 42:45.600
on the keypad of a, on the type pad, sorry, of a computer. Well, okay, big deal. It is not work.

42:46.400 --> 42:53.920
So retirement is actually a gift of abundant energy. You have no retirement in countries

42:53.920 --> 42:58.800
that are very sober regarding their energy consumption. And so of course, unfortunately,

42:58.800 --> 43:05.360
I have to say the long-term trend is that in the future, it will be harder and harder to retire.

43:06.080 --> 43:12.240
So building on that, let me ask you a difficult question. I frequently cite that a barrel of

43:12.240 --> 43:18.160
oil is worth around five years of human labor. You've made similar statements,

43:19.520 --> 43:27.360
including that we've essentially replaced slave labor with, with fossil fuels. So if energy supply

43:27.360 --> 43:32.480
is going to contract, it's not, it's my, it's my, it's my order of magnitude. I've got exactly the

43:32.480 --> 43:38.960
same order of magnitude. Yes. Well, it's five years of work. Yeah. Of hard or very hard work.

43:39.040 --> 43:44.240
Yeah. Very hard work. Yes. Well, it's the actual math is around 12 years, but humans are more

43:44.240 --> 43:49.280
efficient with directing muscle labor to actual work. So you have to handicap it, but it's around

43:49.280 --> 43:55.920
four and a half, five years. So, so you just suggested that of the 16 exporting countries

43:55.920 --> 44:02.720
that Europe imports oil from, they'll be cut in half their production by 2050 plus or minus.

44:02.720 --> 44:10.400
So if we contract energy supply, we're con, we're also GDP and jobs are also going to shrink. So do

44:10.400 --> 44:17.680
you think it's likely or possible that we see a resurgence in things like slavery as fossil

44:17.680 --> 44:23.040
energy availability declines and, and do you have hopes that we can avoid such a scenario?

44:23.040 --> 44:35.520
It's my fear. My fear is that relationships between humans will become, I would say,

44:36.640 --> 44:45.920
harder than they were, but we'll have more. I don't know how the expression in English

44:46.800 --> 44:56.000
uphold the force. We'll have tensions between humans and brutal force

44:57.120 --> 45:04.640
will be more important than, than, than it was. Of course, I'm not sure that we'll have less,

45:04.640 --> 45:14.320
less work. We might have less jobs or less revenues. But, but when we had no machines,

45:15.040 --> 45:20.400
we worked harder. So I do not know exactly how it's going to recompose. I mean, but

45:21.840 --> 45:30.720
the main ideas are we'll work, we'll have more hard work, and we'll earn less, basically,

45:30.720 --> 45:39.360
because what energy did is triggering the exact opposite, working less, and, and, and earning more.

45:39.520 --> 45:45.520
That's what I refer to as the great simplification, the name of this podcast,

45:45.520 --> 45:50.320
based on Tainter's premise of complexification required energy.

45:50.320 --> 45:58.480
If, if it's possible, because you see two centuries ago, the world economy relied on

45:58.480 --> 46:11.920
only nine metals. It relied on iron, copper, zinc, tin, lead, and a couple of them more.

46:13.040 --> 46:19.280
Today, you do not have a single element of the table of Mandelaev that doesn't have an industrial

46:19.280 --> 46:29.120
application, not one. And you and I, we depend on all these 92 elements, because, for example,

46:30.000 --> 46:38.320
you depend as I depend on, on the digital system, which by itself requires 60 to 70 different

46:38.320 --> 46:43.360
elements. Today, there is no single company that can operate within, within an information system.

46:44.000 --> 46:50.960
No one. I mean, if you go back to paper sheets and pencils, you cannot operate any company today.

46:52.480 --> 47:01.920
We, so basically, in simplifying the present world is going to be extremely hard, extremely hard.

47:03.440 --> 47:09.680
So you're getting at complexity, which I refer to as one of the big four risks that we face.

47:10.160 --> 47:16.000
I consider them to be the financial system, geopolitics, complexity, and the social contract.

47:16.640 --> 47:22.720
Not energy per se, but it's the, it's the change from abundant energy to flat or declining that

47:22.720 --> 47:32.560
will trigger those other, those other things. So you've got, in Europe, a real-time trial of this,

47:32.560 --> 47:39.360
of sorts going on right now because of the Russian situation in Ukraine, in your experience in

47:39.360 --> 47:45.680
France. What if people's response has been, especially last winter, to increasing prices

47:46.320 --> 47:54.160
in Europe? Has it created stronger community cohesion and a return to relying on social

47:54.160 --> 47:59.600
capital? Or has it caused more division over scarcity? Or what's been your, your kind of

48:01.280 --> 48:09.200
trial run? Basically, in France, it has triggered very high prices of natural gas

48:09.200 --> 48:18.400
and energy and electricity, sorry. And it has triggered significant savings by people. So they

48:18.400 --> 48:27.840
heated less. They use less electricity. A number of companies and mostly energy-intensive industries

48:27.840 --> 48:36.320
produce less. That's basically what happened. I have not felt a major change in social structures

48:36.320 --> 48:41.440
or the way people behave. Actually, it has nothing to do with what happened during the COVID, for

48:41.440 --> 48:52.560
example. Last year, nothing much happened. The political response has been significant.

48:53.600 --> 49:02.000
And now the word sobriety is everywhere in political speeches. That is something significant.

49:02.720 --> 49:09.760
What does the word sobriety mean? It means, actually, my own classification of energy savings

49:11.600 --> 49:18.160
includes three, well counts three terms. The first one is efficiency. Efficiency is getting

49:18.160 --> 49:23.600
the same service while using less energy, either to manufacture an object or to use it.

49:24.320 --> 49:31.760
The second term that I use is sobriety, which is deliberately waiving a service of good

49:32.400 --> 49:39.680
in order to save resources or energy. For example, I was using a car, I use a bike,

49:39.680 --> 49:47.360
or I commute by train. This is sobriety. And poverty is exactly the same physical

49:47.360 --> 49:54.400
item than sobriety. Only you didn't ask for it. So sobriety is having no longer

49:54.400 --> 50:02.560
the economic means to own a car or to use it. And so you have to use a bike or to go by train.

50:02.560 --> 50:09.200
But you didn't want it. My belief is that today what happens in France is actually poverty.

50:10.080 --> 50:15.120
People didn't ask for it and they have to organize themselves differently.

50:16.080 --> 50:24.720
But the government, no government can use the word poverty. So they use the word sobriety,

50:25.360 --> 50:32.160
which is giving the impression that we do it in an organized and deliberate way.

50:32.640 --> 50:40.640
It gives people agency to have sobriety instead of poverty. So I think the distinction between

50:40.640 --> 50:47.520
those two is really important and clever. Do you think that individuals listening to this program

50:47.520 --> 50:56.000
or cultures, nations, can choose sobriety before it is forced upon us as poverty?

50:56.720 --> 51:07.440
I believe no. One of my friends with whom I work in France says you have the strategy of your sets.

51:10.480 --> 51:20.000
So it basically goes the other way around. So my belief is that the best that you can hope

51:20.240 --> 51:29.440
is that the day you have a shock or a crash, then you can pull out of the drawer a sobriety plan

51:30.480 --> 51:36.560
that was framed or conceived before you had the shock or the crash. But I don't believe that

51:38.800 --> 51:45.600
democracies will spontaneously implement a decrease of their production and their consumption.

51:45.600 --> 51:52.160
But I do believe that they can decide to go that direction the day they realize that anyway,

51:52.160 --> 51:59.040
they do not have the choice. Again, because that's the strategy of your set. And if I can be a little

51:59.040 --> 52:05.920
bit rude, because I understand that I'm talking mostly to US auditors, I believe that it's going

52:05.920 --> 52:12.720
to be even more complicated in the US, which is the land of plenty, which was built on tremendous

52:12.720 --> 52:20.080
resources, tremendous land, and basically through getting rid of all the previous inhabitants and

52:21.360 --> 52:29.120
animals that were there. So the country with no limits by excellence is the US.

52:31.200 --> 52:34.480
And so it's going to be even harder in the US than it is in Europe.

52:35.040 --> 52:42.640
Well, let me ask you about that, because Europe will arguably have to face sobriety

52:42.640 --> 52:49.520
and poverty before the US does, because we still produce 90-some percent of our own energy.

52:50.320 --> 52:56.560
Will that be a blessing or a curse? Will Europe have to suffer the pain first, but

52:56.560 --> 53:01.280
they will reorganize in different ways that will ultimately be more helpful? What do you think?

53:02.080 --> 53:12.480
I think it can be both, and history will tell. I don't know. I mean, it's a blessing in the way that

53:13.840 --> 53:18.240
what I hope is that we use the residual fossil fuels that we have at hand

53:19.120 --> 53:23.440
to build a world that can operate the best it can without fossil fuels.

53:25.280 --> 53:30.560
It is not something that people understand clearly today. It is an idea which is making

53:30.560 --> 53:36.800
its way, but slowly. And of course, I believe that in the US, you are

53:37.600 --> 53:41.600
farther from that idea, because you still have plenty of resources.

53:43.920 --> 53:52.800
And also, I won't, you will not learn with me that actually your country is two countries.

53:54.240 --> 53:57.440
You have the US of the coast and the US of the middle.

53:58.400 --> 54:03.760
And actually, it's two different countries. And the reaction to what I'm explaining right now

54:04.320 --> 54:12.160
is totally different, whether you are talking to Massachusetts or California or Wisconsin

54:13.680 --> 54:21.200
or Ohio. So I'm actually, again, totally aligned with you on this. I don't think we're going to

54:21.200 --> 54:26.640
change until we're forced to. So the best thing that people listening to this and you and I are

54:26.640 --> 54:35.600
working on is building those plans for when that moment comes. So you, among other projects,

54:36.960 --> 54:42.400
you run the shift project, which has plans for transforming the French economy.

54:42.400 --> 54:46.480
Can you give a brief overview of what you're doing and what your hopes are there?

54:46.960 --> 54:59.760
Yes. That work started during the COVID. Actually, when the COVID stroke, it was clear for me

55:00.400 --> 55:06.880
that a number of companies would ask for help. They would say, okay, we cannot operate anymore.

55:06.880 --> 55:10.640
Give us some money or we'll have to fire, we'll go bankrupt and we'll fire everyone,

55:10.720 --> 55:17.120
which in France is much more drama than in the US. And so I thought at the time,

55:17.760 --> 55:22.800
one of the things that we should try to design is the counterparts that the state should ask

55:22.800 --> 55:28.960
to these companies before lending them a helping hand. So, okay, we are going to sign the check,

55:29.520 --> 55:39.200
but we asked you to do this and that regarding being able to operate in a world with less

55:39.200 --> 55:47.280
fossil fuels. And then we realized pretty quickly that our work would never be ready

55:48.320 --> 55:53.760
before the first checks would be signed. And so we said, okay, we are going to do something

55:53.760 --> 56:00.720
slightly different. We are going to design a plan which is how we should reorganize the economy

56:01.680 --> 56:13.440
if we want to align ourselves with a decrease of 5% premiere of the greenhouse gases emissions in the

56:13.440 --> 56:21.520
world. And this is called the plan transformation of the economy franÃ§ais planned to transform

56:21.520 --> 56:27.920
the French economy. And actually, it's an attempt to do economy without talking euros or dollars

56:27.920 --> 56:34.960
at first, but we talk physical flows. So basically what we do is that we look at the physical flows

56:34.960 --> 56:42.640
that frame the economy, the construction sector, the automotive industry, the way we grow food and

56:42.640 --> 56:48.480
transform it, etc. And we say if we want to decrease that by 5%, sorry, if we want to decrease the

56:48.480 --> 56:55.360
greenhouse gases emissions by 5% per year, what does it mean regarding the number of cars that

56:55.360 --> 57:01.360
we manufacture given the energy efficiency of manufacturing one car, the number of houses that

57:01.360 --> 57:08.800
we build, the number of people that can move around in cars and trucks, etc. And the number of

57:08.800 --> 57:17.840
people that are employed in the different sectors. So it's planned to transform the system without

57:17.840 --> 57:24.880
saying we should invest money here, finance such a sector with so many billion dollars here, etc.

57:25.600 --> 57:33.520
Do not talk money at all. And it's a method in a way to address the economy as a physical system.

57:34.880 --> 57:41.920
And we had a huge success in France, because we published a book which was called the plan

57:41.920 --> 57:49.680
transformation of the economy franÃ§ais. And we sold over 1100,000 copies, which in France

57:49.680 --> 57:58.000
is a huge success for a book for an essay. In order to give you a comparison, it happens that

57:58.000 --> 58:04.400
a graphic novel that I wrote with Christophe Blain, which is called the world without end,

58:04.400 --> 58:12.880
the Mont-Saint-FranÃ§ was in 2022, the number one book in France, the most sold book in France,

58:12.880 --> 58:21.520
and we sold a little bit over 500,000 copies. So 100,000 copies for an essay on decarbonizing

58:21.520 --> 58:30.400
the French economy, it's a huge success. I mean, in our wildest dreams, we wouldn't have come up

58:30.400 --> 58:37.040
with such a figure. And plenty of top executives have read it, plenty of politicians have read it,

58:38.000 --> 58:46.640
and I believe that we have oriented a little the debate in France on the way to decarbonize

58:46.640 --> 58:52.160
the economy with this work and with this book. So it's a method, again, and we could apply it to

58:52.160 --> 59:01.280
the US, exactly the same method. It's how do we orient the physical flows of economy if we want

59:01.360 --> 59:04.640
to decrease the greenhouse gases emissions by X percent per year.

59:05.360 --> 59:12.400
So in the global north, I suspect that the country that you live in, France,

59:13.280 --> 59:19.280
may be closer as a culture to understanding climate energy constraints, partially due to

59:19.840 --> 59:23.680
your book, you said 500,000 copies, partially there's this

59:23.760 --> 59:32.400
Collapsology, you know, subculture there, French President Macron periodically voices comments

59:32.400 --> 59:37.920
that the best times are behind us economically. You know, are these books and discussions

59:38.640 --> 59:44.640
allowing France to be ahead of the curve, discussing limits to growth, sobriety,

59:45.760 --> 59:50.800
and is that good or bad? What is your thought? Again, we have the strategy of our sets.

59:51.360 --> 59:59.680
What is our sets? It's our history. For no country, we have experienced hunger,

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:09.680
wars, physical limits of all kinds, and so just as Great Britain, just as Scandinavian countries,

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:16.960
just as Switzerland. So the only countries that had an easy life in the ancient world were Italy

01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:25.040
and Spain, which are countries today that I would say not, they are not as comfortable as

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:31.360
countries that are farther up north with large scale organizations designed to face a constraint.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.560
And so it's only the result of our history. When you look at other countries in the world

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:45.440
that resemble us, you have Japan, a country with no resources, very strong technical culture,

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:50.480
and which is also very conscious of the limits of the physical limits today.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.560
And you have, in a way, China. Same thing. I mean, China is a North country that has experienced

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:04.240
also hunger, wars, physical limits, and which is also a country of engineers historically.

01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:12.320
In ancient China, the top class people were the engineers able to operate all the hydraulic system

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:21.600
feeding the rice paddies, well, or supplying the rice paddies. So all these countries have

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:28.560
things in common, which countries that have been recently occupied and which are very,

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:37.440
I would say, very big, vast countries with plenty of resources are not like the US,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:44.480
like Brazil, like Canada, in a way like Russia, what we could call anti-countries,

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:50.000
while these countries are not so comfortable with global physical limits.

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.880
So in preparing for this interview, Jean-Marc, I was reading about you yesterday,

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:05.360
and you are increasingly being called a guru and a most influential public intellectual

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:13.200
in French media. I'm just curious, how are you navigating, describing,

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:21.840
our extremely challenging biophysical reality in a political system that in France and globally

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:30.880
rewards simplicity and feel-good messaging, where your message is counter to that? How are you finding

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:38.320
that? What has changed the relationship between an individual and the population today is social

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:45.600
networks. My faith would probably have been very different in a world with only media,

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:54.720
because I would have, in that world, without pleasing the journalist, nobody would have heard of me.

01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:59.840
In the modern world, with the social media, you can put online videos, you can put online

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:08.320
long videos or conferences, you can put online explanations, I used to maintain now, it's a

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:18.560
bit old-fashioned, a website to vulgarize energy and climate change issues. And the reason why

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.840
the graphic novel that I mentioned before was a success is that before that, the online videos

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:32.080
of the course that I teach at Mint Paris was already a success. And the reason why is that,

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:40.480
well, success by French figures. I think I went up to one million views or something like that.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:49.440
And it was a success because people appreciate consistency. Actually, I believe that the reason

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:57.600
why I have had a small success is that I offered to a number of people that were

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:05.040
vaguely conscious of something, but couldn't put a name on it, all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:12.400
that they can assemble and get a clear picture of. So I provide them with some kind of comfort

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.400
of not being so stupid because they felt that something was

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:24.320
not corresponding to the explanations they got elsewhere, basically. And

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.160
the fact that I have a base in a way that I can address directly through social media,

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:42.000
like for example today, I write a daily post on LinkedIn, I publish videos online once in a while,

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:50.000
et cetera, makes it so that my reputation cannot be made only by the media.

01:04:52.320 --> 01:05:00.400
Whereas in the past, you were fully dependent on what the media said of you for your reputation.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:09.360
Now it's a little bit different. So the relationship that I have with the press

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:20.560
is, I would say, in between a distant relationship. Whenever I get an invitation,

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.640
I don't say yes all the time. Actually, I say yes one time out of 10 maybe.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:33.840
And I don't feel like I desperately need them. And actually, my day-to-day job doesn't evolve

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:40.800
me. My day-to-day job is to run a company and to chair an NGO. It has nothing to do with the media.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:50.960
So when I'm labeled a guru of whatever, the best thing that I can do is not respond.

01:05:51.840 --> 01:06:03.280
It's not responding. And if some people mention it to me, then I answer saying what I think of it.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:14.960
Well, I think people not only value consistency, but they value truth and authenticity. And I suspect,

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:23.680
I don't know, but I suspect as events get closer, as we have more expensive and less available energy,

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:31.200
that the conventional media will not be able to tell the full biophysical truth that you and I are

01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:40.800
telling. It's just too threatening to the general public. So the role that you and others are playing

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:48.720
is very interesting in informing and hopefully inspiring society towards change. Do you agree?

01:06:49.520 --> 01:07:00.640
Partially only because I think that what the press can do is describe simultaneously

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:09.680
a problem and the way to react to the problem. Just saying over and over and over that there is a

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:16.560
problem is something indeed that they don't appreciate much. And actually, when you look at

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:24.480
the way the vulgarized climate change, they have selected information which is distant in space

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:32.240
and in time. Basically, the information that they like the most is what will happen in 2100

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:40.560
and the global temperature increase. So this is distant in time, 2100, and it is distant in

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.040
space because it's a global temperature and you don't feel a global temperature and I don't feel

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.000
a global temperature. I mean, I feel the temperature which is right now in the room where I am and you

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.960
feel the temperature which is right now in the room where you are. And neither of us feels the

01:07:55.040 --> 01:08:03.360
average temperature. It doesn't exist for our senses. But what the media don't speak of much,

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:07.760
and there was an article published also in the scientific literature pointing that

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:16.720
a couple of months ago, there very much relay information that pertains to things that are

01:08:16.720 --> 01:08:23.520
not so distant in the future and pretty local. Like for example, what will be the flow of the

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:29.920
color of the river in tenures and the consequences that it can have on crops. That is something

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:38.400
that they do not give much audience to this kind of scientific work, even though you have plenty

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:49.680
of scientific publications that pertain to this kind of issue. So what they like again, the media

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:55.760
is talking of an issue when you have the beginning of a solution or the beginning of a way to react

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:02.640
or to act facing the issue. And this is why I've set up the SHIFT project. The SHIFT project is

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:10.400
actually fully devoted to proposing ways to confront the issue and to react to the issue

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:17.840
and to organize ourselves with the issue. So it also tries to provide hope in a way.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:25.440
And then you can get more audience on both the issue and the way to react to the issue.

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:32.240
The leading economic paper in France, which is called MESICO, gives much more audience

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:39.120
to environmental issues now than it did just two years ago. But the reason why is that they

01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:46.640
right now also have many stories to tell regarding companies or action which is being taken

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:54.160
to face the issue. So that's the reason why. And do I believe that France is at the forefront?

01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:04.160
I would say in a bunch which is globally very late, the answer is yes. So what I believe is that

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:12.400
in a collection of countries that are globally extremely late, France is a little bit less late

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:18.880
than the others. We have done a number of things that were done for the first time.

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:25.840
Well, I mean, you and I have been telling variations of this story publicly for 20 years.

01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:33.680
And I feel that the world events have caught up to the story that we're telling. What's your

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:39.680
experience? Are people obviously because of your popularity, people are now more receptive to this?

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:45.440
I believe it goes the other way around. I believe I am popular because people realized.

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:57.520
People realized. I'm surfing on the wave. Yes, because we have heat waves, because we have

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:04.480
prices of gasoline going up and down and up very often. Because we have, I mean, yes.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:12.240
Yeah. Because people realized. So, and for example, let me take another example,

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:21.920
which is the opinion that French have on nuclear energy. It gained recently 20 percentage points

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:29.280
in support. So about 50% of the French population supported nuclear energy two years ago.

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:38.080
One third were against and 15% said they had no opinion. It jumped from 50 to 70% in two years.

01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:45.040
So you could say, okay, that's chocolate, this is false. But actually, it evolved exactly the

01:11:45.040 --> 01:11:49.920
same way in all other European countries. Well, that could be because of Russia and Ukraine.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:58.240
Even in Germany, whatever, even in Germany, it gained 15 percentage points of support.

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.080
And I am sure of one thing that in Germany, people have never heard of me.

01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.200
And in Finland, people have never heard of me. And in Spain, people have never heard of me.

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:15.600
So I think we should put it the other way around. First, people realized. And then

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.240
well, the people that said, I can explain you why become popular.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:31.760
So I have some closing questions that I ask all my guests. I have so much more I want to talk to

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:38.720
you about. But before I get to those questions, let me just ask you one one final content question.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:46.080
What the hell are we going to do? What should we do facing this as nations?

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.280
You're on the spot, Jean-Marc. Go for it.

01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:59.200
As nations, we will do what our populations ask for, as long as we are democracies.

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.200
Which is why at the SHIFT project, we never considered that we should address first and

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:12.000
foremost politicians. But we believe that we should address first and foremost the civil society.

01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:19.200
So the people that we're interested to deal with are people who are deciding in the economic sector,

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:27.200
are deciding as civil servants, are deciding as academics. So people that frame our collective

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:35.280
knowledge and people that are deciding in the NGO sector. So this is our primary audience.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.440
The people that we want to talk to is the civil society. And we believe that the day

01:13:41.440 --> 01:13:47.920
we are able to convince a sufficient fraction of that civil society, that it goes up because

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:54.640
democracies are systems that go up. And the elected people have to take that into account

01:13:54.640 --> 01:14:01.440
in a way or another. And I never believe that we should talk to politicians first. And actually,

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:06.560
I'm not especially eager to talk to them. I mean, once in a while, I've got an invitation

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:13.360
from a minister or whatever, so I'm polite. I go to it. But I don't hope much for it. And what

01:14:14.800 --> 01:14:19.520
my real, the audience that I'm really interested in is the civil society.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:24.320
So we need to shift society before the politicians. Yeah.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:33.920
Yes. Exactly. You have a president elected because you have people voting for him, basically.

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:47.280
And a significant fraction of the civil society in France still, I'm not knowing the word inappropriate,

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:54.240
but escapes our influence. All the people that vote for the populist parties.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.320
Basically, we are not able to talk to them today, which is an issue, which is a big issue. I mean,

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:06.320
we have to talk to these people and I still haven't found a way to do so.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:14.240
Because these people actually are the first losers of the energy contraction. They don't

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:21.840
realize it, but they are the first. So we have to talk to them and we have to embark them on the

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:32.400
on the plan that we believe is, I would say, response correctly to the situation.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:41.280
And I don't see that at my age, there is much more that I can do than going on,

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.480
doing what I've already done, which is working with companies at carbon four,

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.760
working with the civil society and the ship project and writing books.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:59.360
Which, and as you may know, the Le Monde Saint-FranÃ§ois is going to be released in the U.S.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.920
We are currently working right now with my co-author on the U.S. version, because we have to

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:12.720
move from meters to feet, square meters to square feet.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:22.480
And we have to change all the examples that pertain to France into examples that pertain to the U.S.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.800
And when will that be out?

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:32.480
It should be released at the end of the year, if we're lucky. So end of the year or beginning

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:37.520
of next year, if we take too long in finishing the adaptation.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:46.240
So the ultimate plan, then, is to combine efficiency and sobriety at multiple scales

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:54.240
in society to avert collapse and avert just abject poverty, some combination at institutional

01:16:54.240 --> 01:17:00.400
government and individual levels. Yes? Yes. Basically, you've summarized it correctly.

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:07.600
Excellent. I'm looking forward to getting your book. Let me ask you a few closing

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:15.040
questions, Jean-Marc, that I ask all my guests. We've talked about nations, etc.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:21.760
What personal advice do you have to people watching this video, listening to this show,

01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:24.640
at this time of global metacrisis?

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:31.680
I would say I have two. The first one is devote time to understand what's going on,

01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:40.000
because basically, the solid conclusions that you get to is always the conclusions that you

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:50.400
have come to by yourself. We are, I mean, human nature is such that we don't like that much

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:59.680
conclusions that we're afraid by others. We lack our own. So take time, dig into the issue, read,

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:05.520
listen to people, watch conferences, whatever, read scientific literature if you can do it.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.320
Otherwise, watch videos of people that are good at verbalizing the issue.

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:22.880
The second thing is do not stay alone, because it's an issue which is easy to become anxious

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:32.560
when you realize the magnitude of the issue. One of the things that we don't like is to

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:38.320
pull ourselves out of a group, because we have understood something that the rest of the group

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:47.600
hasn't understood. We will never do that to take action. The only action that we're able to take,

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.320
at least in Europe, maybe in the US, it's a little bit different, is collective action,

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:59.840
which is why it's easier to do something in the frame of a job, in the professional world,

01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:06.800
it's easier to do something, because it can be collective action. We need to still have

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:14.560
social relationships. We still need to have a couple friends, kids, relatives, whatever,

01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:22.080
and so moving forward is something which is much easier to do when you belong to a group.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:27.600
Is there a way that the 500,000 people that bought your book or the 100,000 people that

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:35.120
bought your transformation essay or that follow your LinkedIn can connect and actually meet and

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:43.600
talk to each other in France, like Discord? There is a sister association of the SHIFT project,

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:50.480
which is called the SHIFTERS, which is the association of all the people that want to

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:58.480
give a helping hand to the work of the SHIFT project. Actually, this association today has

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:07.760
around 20,000 members, a small number of them being in foreign countries,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:15.840
of course, but by and large, the two first foreign countries are Belgium and Switzerland,

01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:23.120
because it's French-speaking countries, but we have a group in the UK, and we probably have a

01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:33.120
small group in the US. This association is very well structured. It's structured as a company,

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:41.520
because most people that belong to that association come from the professional world,

01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.800
and so they have organized the association basically as a company. So it's very well

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:54.880
structured. Yes, we have that. How would you change your answer about those two bits of advice

01:20:54.880 --> 01:21:00.560
if you were talking to young humans in France or in the United States or anywhere in the world?

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:08.000
16, 18, 20 years old who are learning about climate change and that energy availability might be

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:14.720
in oil, half of what it is 30 years from now. What sort of recommendations would you give to

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:23.360
young people? Actually, the youngest people that I often talk to are students,

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:29.440
so I do not talk to people, I do not very often talk to people that are still in high school

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:43.520
or primary school, but I would say that probably my first advice is to be reasonably good

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:53.280
in science, which is the way to connect to the physical world and the way to understand

01:21:53.280 --> 01:22:04.000
how things work, how the world works, where to listen at weak signals, to look at weak

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:11.040
signals before they become of first magnitude. So probably that the best advice that I would give

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:28.000
to young people would be to try to be good in science at large, which is again connecting

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.600
with the physical world. If you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:41.920
decision, what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures?

01:22:44.400 --> 01:22:45.280
Surprise greed?

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:50.720
That would require a magic wand, I think.

01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:59.920
Including for me, including for you, including for everyone, I mean it's one of the things that

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:05.520
gives us, is that desire to have always more?

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:18.080
Well, energy surplus has certainly turbocharged that in humans. I think without as much energy

01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:26.240
surplus, there was no possibility of having more all the time, so that is one of the things that

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:32.160
scares me the most is the concept of loss aversion because we are the richest generation ever to

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:40.560
live of humans on this planet and we would be happy with half what we have, but getting from

01:23:40.560 --> 01:23:47.840
here to there is going to be a doozy because of our psychological expectations are not that as a

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:56.640
culture. Yes, I agree with that. Yeah, so this has been a great first overview of your work. I

01:23:56.640 --> 01:24:03.680
know you are a nuclear, a world expert on nuclear energy and we didn't really have time to dive into

01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:10.800
that. If you were to come back on the program six months from now, what is one particular issue

01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.600
that you are passionate about that's relevant to our future that we could take a deep dive on?

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:23.440
Do you have any speculation? I don't think that all the technological debates,

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:32.320
be it on nuclear energy or wind energy or hydrogen or etc., is a fundamental debate.

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:39.200
Basically, the fundamental debate is on cultural issues, just the one that we stated.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:50.240
We will succeed one day in putting ethics above our greed, for example, we will succeed.

01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:57.200
It seems to me that this debate is much more fundamental even though I've been

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:03.840
trained as an engineer and for a very, very long time I was convinced that the future was in technical

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:21.600
fixes. Well, now I believe that actually it's in the way we accept to change our cultural references,

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:29.600
which is much harder actually. It's much easier to build a nuclear reactor than changing our minds.

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:37.760
Yeah, the next tech is maybe inner tech, the tech in our minds on how we experience the world

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:44.480
and how we can get most of the things we really want without using a lot of energy and materials.

01:25:44.480 --> 01:25:50.240
At least that's my hope. This has been great. It was so nice to meet you and like I said,

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.320
it feels like we're on parallel paths and different parts of the world and if I can help you in your

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:03.120
work, let me know and I will definitely get your book when it comes to the United States and we'll

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.760
put all the show notes on this episode of your references and such. Thank you very much.
