0	4960	So most of what we've seen is a growth in our wealth, our growth in the consumption levels we
4960	9920	have, has come from that increase in energy. And now we're cooking with gas in that sense
9920	14320	because we're finally acknowledging the role of energy in production. But that's not what
14320	23120	neoclassicals are doing, of course. I'd like to welcome Professor Steve Keen back to the podcast.
23120	29760	Steve is author of Debunking Economics and the New Economics of Manifesto.
30640	35680	Steve is, among many other things, a research fellow at the Institute for Strategy, Resilience,
35680	43280	and Security at University College in London. He is writing a new book, and today we discuss
43280	52240	one of the chapters in his book, which is an economic sleuth story on the origins of energy
52320	61680	blindness. We go back all the way to Adam Smith and look at a series of wrong turns in the road
61680	71200	that neoclassical economists made on the treatment of land, energy, and things that are not
71200	77920	capital and labor. This is a difficult podcast. Steve is an economist, talks in a lot of
77920	84880	economist language. I barely understood what he was saying, but I did understand the critical
84880	92880	importance of his main message is that our main shaman of our culture today, those that we look
92880	97840	to for answers and explanations of what's happening and what will happen in the future,
98480	104160	are truly divorced from our biophysical and ecological reality in their formulas.
104800	111360	This ultimately is a really big deal. There's a chapter in Steve's upcoming book on that,
112240	121440	but this is a one and a half hour treatment of energy blindness and its origins. Please welcome
121440	138000	back to the show Steve Keane. Steve Keane, good to see you. Welcome to the good of you back again,
138000	146080	my good talk. This is a monumental podcast for three reasons. One, it's my last podcast of 2023
146160	153040	recording. Two, it's my first podcast on prep for a colonoscopy, so hopefully we won't have to
153040	161840	interrupt it too many times. And third, I think you have just finished a detective story about a
161840	169760	concept that I often talk about, energy blindness. I know the result of why our culture, why our
169840	177280	institutions are energy blind, but you have just written a book and a chapter on the energy
177280	184000	production function and you've gone back to the original papers from the classical neoclassical
184000	191760	economists and figured out why humanity has over time completely neglected the role of energy
192400	198400	in our descriptions of wealth and productivity. So we could talk about climate change, you know a
198400	202560	lot about that, we could talk about money and you know a lot about that and we probably should,
202560	209680	but today I want to just unpack your story of what you've been working on the last couple months
209680	217600	with respect to energy blindness. Okay, let's roll. First question. All right, so take me to the
217600	226240	beginning. We had classical economists back in the day, right? Yeah, and virtually every economist,
226320	232560	if you ask them who's the father of economics, going to answer Adam Smith. And in a sense, I was
233440	238880	inclined that way, except that I've read previous economists to Smith as well,
238880	244320	including the physiocrats. And my attitude was that the physiocrats were more advanced on important
244320	251680	issues, both macroeconomics and the role of energy in production than who were the physiocrats.
251680	257600	They were a bunch of 19th and 18th century French, mainly French, but also some Irish
257600	262080	economists who worked in French. And this is in France. And this is before we actually had
262080	266480	the term of economist in many ways. So there are people who are trying to analyze how the production
266480	272480	system works. And the they're called physiocrats because the leading personality, the leading
272480	278320	intellect in the group was Francois Connais. And Connais was the physician to the king of France.
278880	286080	And he was working at the time when we were having the very first autopsies to find out,
286080	290480	you know, what was inside a body, because for a long time in the West, there were religious
291680	299200	laws, rules against carving open a dead body. And then we started to do it. And Connais was
299200	304240	involved in this. He found all these tubes running all over the body and had this vision of a system
304240	309680	of circulation for the body. And then when it came to looking at the economy, they had the same
309680	314880	idea. There's a system of circulation, goods go from one spot to another money goes in the
314880	322800	opposite direction. And there was this sense of saying, we can see the economy is a dynamic
322800	328560	system in the same way we're now realizing the body is because all these tubes flow down and
328560	333600	flow back up again, the arteries go through the body, they become veins come back up again,
333600	339360	there's circulation of blood, there's mixing of blood with oxygen, all these sorts of things were
339360	344960	the vision and in that sense, the basic paradigm they started from wasn't mechanics as neoclassical
344960	350560	economists have ended up doing, it was biology. And that was a far more sensible starting place.
351360	357360	And so instead of calling them bureaucrats, they were physicians that were advising the king. So
357360	364800	they call them physiocrats. Well, the most dominant personality was Cannae. And there's
364800	371200	two combinations. He was a physician for the king, literally the king's physician. Now,
371200	377760	that did two things, gave him enormous prominence. It also gave him plenty of spare time because
378400	383680	he only got one person to occasionally have to do something medical with. So for the rest of the
383680	389600	time he was working in trying to work, and the interest was in how the economy functions as a
389600	397760	sort of monetary and physical goods version of a body circulation system. This was in the 18th
397760	409200	century in Europe? 1700s, yeah. So as people like William Petty was trying to work out how the economy
409200	416800	functioned in England at similar times, Sip Smith afterwards, of course. But the curious thing about
416800	421840	being based in France is that France at the time compared to Scotland, it's we're not comparing
421840	427760	France to England, but France to Scotland because of Smith. France was still overwhelmingly
427760	434240	agricultural, okay? Agriculture dominated production in France. You had, you know, some
434240	440560	level of manufacturing with nothing like what was developing in Scotland at the time. Sip Smith's
440560	447120	book came out, I think the same year as the very first James Watt steam engine was sold. And but
447120	453600	of course we had the previous models before which are much less efficient was still steam engines.
453600	459680	And you had steam power and water power and wind power being used in all the factories in Scotland.
460640	467040	But from the point of view of the physiocrats, they said, well, what they were looking at was,
467040	472480	you know, rural France. And what they saw was a farmer would plant one seed and a thousand seeds
472480	480640	would come out of it. And so their orientation was that wealth comes from the land. And it isn't
480640	485120	the labor that goes into making something that gives it the value. They didn't even talk about
485200	490400	that. Well, they did, but we're as a secondary factor. So they said the source of wealth is the
490400	497760	land. And the husbandman as they call the farmer is the one who exploits what they call the free gift
497760	506080	of nature. And their perspective was first of all to say that the land is the source of all value.
506080	511920	That was the opening four or five words of Richard Cantillon's an essay on economic theory,
511920	517840	which was published in French 21 years before Smith wrote the Wealth of Nations.
517840	523600	First of all, for the French, not only did Smith read French, he was in France taking a young
523600	530960	nobleman around for education and met Cannae. So he was quite aware of the literature in French
530960	537920	before he wrote the Wealth of Nations. And we'll never know whether Smith derived his ideas partially
537920	543360	from the physiocrats and interactions with them, because he insisted that all his notes were burnt
543920	549600	upon his death. So we don't have any long term record of influences on Smith. But this school
549600	556960	of thought was very strong and had a definitive foundation for explaining where wealth came
556960	563840	from. And it wasn't from labor, it was from land. And then there was steam engines. And we were off
563920	567840	to the races. And our stories changed influenced by Adam Smith.
568400	574320	Well, that's much right in the wrong direction. Because what the physiocrats also said was,
574320	579760	because with land, they said, well, the land receives the free gift of nature. And that
579760	585600	had many potential meanings. But fundamentally, from our perspective, looking back, it was energy.
586800	592000	Because the sun's energy lands on the soil, plants absorb the energy, the plants grow,
592640	597760	the husbandman's actual labor is far less important than the productivity of the soil
597760	604480	and the exposures of natural elements, the climate, the sunshine coming in. And that was the source
604480	610560	of wealth. And they said the husbandman is the only source of wealth. And if you look at the
610560	616240	writings that people like Turgo and Candle on and can they had, and you look at it from the
616240	620400	point of view that you and I have of the role of energy and production, they are fundamentally
620400	628960	saying the free gift of energy is what enables us to produce anything. And what we often would
628960	634080	be called a surplus by other schools of thought is the gap between the energy put in by the husbandman
634080	639680	and the energy retrieved. And there's a wonderful sentence from Turgo, where he says the husband
639680	644480	receives the free gift of nature, which he did not pay for and which he sells. Okay.
645200	649280	Well, that's a microcosm of our entire economic system today.
649280	654880	Exactly. So in that sense, the physiocrats had it right. The one mistake they made,
654880	658720	and this is the thing where the whole thing fell over. And Smith played a role on this,
658720	663600	is that they could not see the same thing in manufacturing. So what they saw for manufacturing
663600	670400	is that manufacturing receives the output of the agricultural sector and transforms it to
670400	678480	some different form, but does not add value. Now, what we know, of course, is that manufacturing
678480	683200	also receives the free gift of nature in the sense that we're exploiting fossil fuel energy,
683200	687040	which has been there for millions of years, but it's basically stored solar power.
687680	692960	And without that input in manufacturing, there'd be no production for manufacturing either.
692960	698000	And at the same point, the manufacturing transformed the free gift of nature, which
698000	703840	is raw energy, into useful energy. So the sensible perspective would have been
703840	707920	to go from the physiocrats' vision of the role of agriculture to then say,
707920	714000	well, it's also in manufacturing. And Smith could have done that, because Smith could have thought,
714000	718080	well, we don't have much farming in Scotland comparatively compared to France,
718080	722960	but we do have manufacturing. And in manufacturing, we're using the free gift of
722960	728480	nature as well. We're putting coal into the early steam engines. We've got water power,
728480	733760	which is another gift of nature, wind power to some extent. But predominantly,
733760	740000	it was steam power and charcoal power, and coal. Coal is becoming very important,
741360	747200	becoming dominant actually, before Smith published The Wealth of Nations. So he could have said,
747200	750720	well, that's also the free gift of nature. But he didn't. What he said instead was,
750800	755920	labour is the source of value. What you have out of that is a switch from seeing
756880	764320	the external, the existing universe, being the source of us transforming the inputs we
764320	770000	form, find there, into something useful for us, which is consistent with the laws of
770000	776000	the laws of thermodynamics, into labour being the source of wealth and division of labour
776000	781040	being the source of growth of wealth. And this is all effectively inside the economy.
781040	788000	There's no reference to outside the economy. So I see Smith, by simply changing one word,
788000	792080	you have Richard Cantillon saying that land is the source of wealth,
792720	798560	to Smith saying labour is the source of wealth. And that completely pushed economics off the rails.
798640	805360	We can only speculate why that happened, but possibly because Scotland was
806080	811280	further along on industrialization. And all of a sudden, we had this wealth and
811280	818400	higher goods and services than a few decades earlier. And there was maybe a human exceptionalism
818400	824640	dynamic. Look at how clever we are and how industrious our citizens of Scotland are.
825360	831440	We're creating these machines and we're creating this productivity. And so that statement, that
831440	838240	shift from the focus of free gifts from nature to the husbandman, the farmer or the labourer,
839040	843280	that was the origin of our current energy blindness, you're saying?
843280	848480	I think so. I can't criticise Smith for this. I'm a great pity,
848480	853360	but I can't criticise him because he had no idea of the consequences. He didn't know
853360	858000	the laws of thermodynamics. He can't criticising for breaching something which wasn't developed
858000	862720	for a century after he actually spoke. But when you look at the... I'm not going to look at some of
862720	868400	the... And even the word energy was invented after he wrote Wealth of Nations, I think.
868400	875280	Did you know either 802 or 809, I think. So the word itself was taken from Greek,
875280	880080	but it was made up in the early 18th century by an English... 19th century.
880080	883360	Early 19th century. It's easy to make that mistake.
883360	886480	No, no, no. I always get that confused too. Sorry, I interrupted you. You were saying...
886480	891280	It's quite an 802. So we can't blame them for not using post-language and we can't
891280	895520	blame Smith for not knowing that there's a law of conservation of energy.
895520	902000	The story continues, though. It wasn't just Smith. The heirs compounded. So what's next?
902000	906480	Well, the next stage is once he said... Smith said that labour is a source of all value
906560	909680	and division of labour is the increase in value and wealth.
910640	916800	You then... Initially, that was used by Smith and Ricardo to attack feudalism and argue in favour
916800	923200	of capitalism. When you look at the role of the classical theory of economics played,
923200	928320	it was to promote trade, it was to promote freedom of movement and freedom of enterprise
928320	934080	against all the restrictions of the feudal system. So in that sense, it was pro-capitalist and that
934080	939120	was the way in which it was used by Smith and Ricardo. Nobody regarded... Smith and Ricardo
939120	945840	was calling for the other side of capitalism, but along comes Marx. Now, Marx... Not only Marx
945840	950960	were plenty of what they call Ricardian socialists before Marx turned up, who took the same idea
950960	956160	that if labour is a source of value, why does... Is the wage not equal to the entire product?
956160	962480	Why does profit exist? That was the twist that was then taken of the interpreting...
962480	966400	Interpreting the classical argument that labour is the source of wealth. Say, well,
966400	970880	it were the source of wealth, why don't we get it? And you have to go back and think about the state
970880	978960	of industry in the... In the 18th and early 19th centuries, kind of fall over that 21st century
978960	984240	thing in the 1900s, all the damn time. But if you think about the state of Scotland at the time,
985040	991120	if I have any analogy to what it was like, it was Calcutta in the 1950s. It was
991680	1001280	stench everywhere from pigs being disemboweled, chemicals pumping out, smoke out of the chimney
1001280	1007840	stacks, et cetera, et cetera. And I've forgotten who coined the phrase of the dark satanic mills,
1007840	1013200	but that was what Scotland looked like at the time. And you had people who used to work in an
1013200	1018720	agricultural environment with quite a few rights that the peasants had back in that time,
1018720	1024320	who pushed through the enclosures movement, became landless labourers fundamentally, had to work
1024320	1031200	in the industrial systems, then found themselves working 14-hour days, normally six days a week,
1031200	1037040	thank God, for the Sabbath. But six days a week, often sleeping inside the factories,
1037040	1041120	it wasn't exactly going to conducive to making you think what a great system capitalism is.
1041760	1045440	On the other hand, of course, the capitalists themselves were benefiting from all this,
1045920	1051040	and bleeding the industrialisation and so on. And the technological change, they thought it was
1051040	1058000	great. So what you had was for the working class and for the urban poor, Ricardian and
1058000	1064560	Smithian economics became a ground for arguing for revolution and for a fairer share of what's
1064560	1073920	being produced. And that political shift was brought to a head by Marx in starting in 1857,
1073920	1079200	where he was prominent well before then, but 1857 with his work on what's called the Grangerisa.
1080560	1088800	And arguments for developing Marx's particular version of the classical theory. And Marx was
1088800	1096080	far more eloquent than saying capitalist exploit labour. He actually said capitalist pay workers
1096080	1100960	precisely what they deserve to be paid in the commodity production system. They get their
1100960	1109280	means of subsistence. That's the cost of reproducing the worker. It's again for the buyer of labour
1109280	1114880	power that there's a gap between labour and labour power, but by no means an injustice to the seller.
1114880	1120320	That's a quote from Marx. But anyway, what you got was Marx being used as the means for saying
1120320	1128560	let's have a revolution. And now in that setting, the classical school from being regarded as positive
1128560	1135440	by the capitalist class and the ruling class. The classical school being Adam Smith in the lake.
1135440	1142000	Adam Smith, Ricardo, and through to ultimately to Marx. But all the time there was a subgroup,
1142000	1147440	which was called, it had no particular name, but they were what I'd call proto-neoclassical
1147440	1152560	economists. And the most prominent would be Augustine Corner, who gave us the mathematics that
1152560	1158080	did what's called corner oligopoly theory and so on, comes from Augustine Corner back in the 1820s.
1158560	1166080	And Jean Baptiste, who was a complete believer in a utility maximizing view of human behavior
1166080	1175680	and equal utility maximizing view of capitalism as a system. And he was vehemently pro-capitalism,
1175680	1180400	which I'm not criticizing here at the moment at all, but I'm saying he had a subjective theory
1180400	1185440	of value, whereas the classical school was objective. So Ricardo, for example, at one stage said
1186400	1192880	the price of co-products are set by the cost of production and not, as has often been said,
1192880	1198720	by supply and demand. So Ricardo was anti-supply and demand. Most people, including the classical
1198720	1206880	economists, don't realize that. But when Marx became the bastion of the classical school,
1207440	1213280	this is in the 1860s and 1870s. At that stage, there was a very rapid turnover in economic
1213280	1218240	teaching at the universities where the subjective theory of value became dominant.
1218800	1223120	And it's passing on from, say, in Corner to Marshall and Jevons and Wal-Rah.
1224160	1228960	Can you briefly state what subjective versus objective theory of value would be?
1229520	1234160	The objective value theory says that the price of something is set by cost of production.
1235520	1239440	So they ultimately, the cost of production determines the price something sells for.
1239520	1244800	Whereas the subjective theory says it's a combination of the utility maximizing
1244800	1250560	desires of the buyer and the profit maximizing desires of the seller. The two together set
1250560	1257520	the price. And as Marshall ultimately says, it is as ridiculous to ask whether supply and demand
1257520	1264320	sets price as to ask which blade of a pair of scissors cuts the paper. So they saw both having
1264320	1269840	to play a role. But they also came down to saying that it isn't just labor that is a source of value.
1269840	1275680	Capital is also a source of value. Now, Marx, when you read Marx properly, and I think there are three
1275680	1281680	people have done that on one of them. Rostovsky is another. But most Marxists don't realize that
1281680	1287680	Marx actually had an explanation for how capital can add value or be a source of surplus value in
1287680	1293680	his terms. I won't get into that here, but that's saying the Marxists don't read Marx properly.
1294880	1299520	Let me ask you a clarifying question because where we're headed, we're going to talk a lot
1299520	1306400	about labor and value. Labor is pretty clear. It's the husbandman. It's the worker. Now,
1306400	1311040	how do you define capital back then? And is it the same today?
1311040	1316400	That's two of the most difficult questions in economics. Capital is fundamentally machinery.
1316400	1322320	Capital is a word for machinery, which we also use almost identically as a word for
1322320	1331440	money, a cumulative value of money. There is no simple mapping from the physical machines
1331440	1338880	to the monetary value of machines. And we'll talk a bit about how an energy approach makes
1338880	1342480	it easy to understand the role of machinery later in our conversation.
1343040	1349520	So with the old equations, if you substitute the word machinery for capital, and then you
1349520	1355120	say labor and machinery in these 19th century formulas, that would be correct. That would be
1355120	1361600	the same inference. That makes sense. So the Marx art, the physical machine adds no value to
1361600	1368640	production. This poses a distortion of his own philosophy, which is a yet another issue for
1368640	1374000	another day. But if you have the labor theory of value interpretation of Marx, a machine adds
1374000	1378640	nothing. It simply contributes to the output, what it cost to make it in the first place. And
1378640	1385520	there's a famous phrase in volume one of Capital, which says, no matter how productive the machine
1385520	1395680	is, if it costs 150 pounds to make or three weeks of labor, then it adds to the product 150
1395680	1400480	pounds or three weeks of labor. So it simply transfers its value, whereas the increase in
1400480	1405440	value comes from labor. That was Marx's labor theory of value argument. Now that
1406400	1412640	contributes to the whole political battle between workers and capitalists over who should get
1414000	1419840	profit, should the capitalists deserve a profit, etc, etc. And that was where the classical school
1419840	1425680	suddenly became on the nose for most capitalists. So the subjective arguments of Sey and Corno
1425680	1432880	and then ultimately, Vorar, Jevons and Menga became much preferred. And I really don't know the
1432880	1442160	politics of the switch in the 1870s. But in 1850s and mid 1860s, the classical school was still
1442160	1448560	dominant at universities and dominant in public discourse. By the 1870s, it was the neoclassical
1448560	1453920	school, which was completely dominant. And classicals were effectively marginalized, pardon
1453920	1458880	the pun. So the marginal school takes over. And the argument is both labor and capital
1458880	1465280	contribute to production and contribute to output. So Marx actually directly or indirectly
1466720	1472800	influenced the birth of what we refer to as neoclassical takeover of economics?
1472800	1477920	Yeah. Now, when that happened, of course, the real thing I'm interested in is not Marx in
1477920	1483920	particular. It's a piece of particular. He's an actor in causing this, but he's not the main
1483920	1491680	stage. What started with the physiocrats had the proto version of energy as the source of value.
1491680	1496240	And that's correct. We know from the point of theory of thermodynamics, we know that
1496240	1503760	there is a set amount of energy in the universe. And what humanity does in its manufacturing
1503760	1510800	process is take significant concentrations of energy and use those to either to convert energy
1510800	1517120	something more useful or to do motive force with that energy. And that is work. And that is what
1517120	1523760	enables us to produce goods and services. But we cannot create energy. We take energy in one form.
1523760	1529200	We put it transferred into another. We actually degraded according to the second law of thermodynamics.
1529200	1534720	So there's no surplus in that sense. What there is is a gap between the energy input needed to
1535200	1541200	harness this free energy and the energy in the free that the energy contained by that free
1541200	1552080	source as well, the coal mine or etc, etc. And that is what we're we're taking advantage of.
1552080	1557600	So we should have an energy theory of production. And if we'd had the physiocrats, we would have
1557600	1564240	got there because once the physicists in that sense caught up with the economists and developed the
1565200	1569040	laws of thermodynamics, economists said, ah, that's what we've been talking about.
1569600	1575440	And we can simply integrate perfectly with that. Instead, we got the wars between labor and capital,
1576480	1581920	workers and capitalists over who's the who's the source of value. And that completely ignored the
1581920	1592320	role of energy. And so the neoclassical economists starting in the 1870s continued to build on this
1592320	1599040	separation from a biophysical physiocrat explanation of our wealth and productivity,
1599040	1605520	kind of at the same time that coal started to expand, we had just found oil and we started
1605520	1612640	the Industrial Revolution in earnest. Then what happened in the field of economics and the description
1612640	1617920	of our productivity and bring us gradually up to the present moment?
1617920	1622720	Well, you had Kanae having a theory of production, which is fundamentally a
1625680	1631040	multiplier version of investment and being multiplied by transfer between different sectors
1631040	1636000	and so on. The first mathematical models came out with both Marx and the classical school
1637200	1645520	and the neoclassical school. But there was still no, as we're used to today, no models,
1645520	1649760	no series of production, which is the mathematical equation saying, here are your inputs, there's
1649760	1657760	your GDP as output. So until that point, it was just stories and rhetoric. And all of a sudden,
1657760	1663200	then at the late 19th century, we started to put math to it and equations.
1663200	1669680	Marshall and Volra and Jevons being the main three that did that, Marshall writing into the 1920s.
1669680	1674000	But the first attempt to have an actual, it's called aggregate production function.
1674000	1680320	So trying to relate the aggregate level of output to the aggregate level of inputs at the level of
1680320	1685360	a macro economy, the first attempt to do that in the neoclassical school was the Cobb Douglas
1685360	1695760	production function. And in both Marshall's work and in Jevons' work, you can find this idea of
1695760	1700800	inputs having marginal productivity. So you put a certain amount of labor in and you get a certain
1700800	1706880	level of output, you add more labor, you get not as much increase in output as the previous level,
1706880	1711760	but still some positive returns. So this idea of marginal productivity of labor
1711760	1718240	and marginal productivity of machinery, which turned up in the neoclassical theory.
1718240	1727440	And I think in the 1890s, J.B. Clarke developed the marginal productivity theory of income
1727440	1734240	distribution, which said that workers receive the marginal product and capital,
1734240	1740240	capitalists receive their marginal product. And so that concept became built into neoclassical
1740240	1745120	theory. So the wage is supposed to reflect the contribution to output of the last worker
1745120	1750480	hired and the rate of profit is supposed to reflect the contribution to output of the last
1750480	1757520	meat machine turned on. But how did they know what percentage of the value of the
1758400	1763280	product that was created was from the worker and from the machine?
1763280	1768800	Well, they didn't actually know in that sense, and they're wrong with the answers they gave.
1768800	1773440	But the basic concept with the marginal productivity theory of income distribution
1773440	1780080	was that the marginal products would be based upon the share of income going to different
1780640	1787680	what economists call factors of production. So if labor gets 75% of GDP, and that was roughly
1787680	1794640	the term that applied in the 1920s, and capitalists get 25%, then the marginal product of labor
1794640	1802480	is 0.75 and the marginal product of capital is 0.25. So that was the general expectation,
1802480	1807760	but nobody put a mathematical number on it until Cob and Douglas, one being a mathematician,
1807760	1810080	the other being an economist. Douglas being the economist.
1810080	1812480	And this was 1920s, 1930s?
1812480	1814240	1928, I think it was. Cob and Douglas?
1814240	1822800	Yeah. So they had painstakingly assembled a set of index numbers. Again, this is why
1822800	1828320	it's important to know your history because as well as knowing how things happen, you also know
1828320	1833920	the context in which they happen. And today we're used to getting GDP figures off the
1834800	1841440	bureau of economic analysis every three months. And then we get a breakdown of the
1841440	1845600	distributions from different sectors, and there's huge tables and statisticians,
1846560	1850240	groups of statisticians that are involved in making this all look consistent. Back then,
1850240	1856000	there were no numbers. There was one person maintaining an index series for GDP,
1856720	1860640	but there were no numbers on the amount of labor and no numbers on the amount of machinery.
1860640	1866720	So Douglas made up fairly carefully, but put together a number of different series that
1866720	1873040	he could find to produce an index of labor, an index of capital, and had this index of
1873040	1878240	the output of machinery, not the entire GDP, that was preexisting at the time,
1878800	1886960	and put together the data, annual data between 1899 and 1922. And then fitted that data
1887520	1891360	with the mathematician Cobb doing the work there. Again, of course, this is on paper.
1892880	1898000	We probably had manual calculators back then. I imagine that would be extremely expensive.
1898000	1902800	They would have existed. Maybe it was done by hand, but the calculations were much,
1902800	1906560	much more painstaking than we're used to today by pumping numbers into a
1907360	1912240	computer programming, almost instantly getting the result. So just 23 numbers,
1912800	1920080	all index numbers, all starting at 118.99, and then going through to different values in 1922.
1920080	1927040	And when they did a regression against that, they use what's called a homogenous of degree one
1927040	1933040	production function. And what that means is that you had output being some constant, and it was a
1933040	1941040	constant, not a variable, a constant, multiplied by capital raised to one power times labor raised
1941040	1949360	to one minus that power. And so the question was, what is the term? I'll call it alpha here,
1949360	1956080	because they use k and one minus k, and that's getting too confusing. Most economists use alpha
1956080	1963040	for the share of machinery in GDP, a share of capitalists in GDP. Now, back at the time,
1963040	1969360	roughly speaking, the share of capitalists in GDP is 25%. So the value for alpha is 0.25,
1969440	1975760	and therefore the value for one minus alpha is 0.75. And the reason it's homogenous of degree one,
1975760	1979840	if you multiply all labor and all capital, you double it, you get twice as much output
1979840	1984320	because the exponents sum to one. So that's the term they found. And lo and behold,
1984320	1992480	the regression came back with values of 0.76 and 0.24. And they said, hey, this is so close to what
1992480	1998640	we expected. That's pretty close to 0.75 and 0.25. Yeah. So they got a number which, and in fact,
1998640	2005600	I've redone it just using a modern program, of course, and I get exactly 0.25. So you get a
2006480	2013760	very strong apparent confirmation of their data. And the correlation, they gave this a correlation
2013760	2018560	coefficient. The r squared is the square of that, of course. And the r squared for doing it now is
2018560	2024800	0.94. Now, the correlation coefficient is 0.97. The response is all that looks fabulously high
2024800	2031280	correlation coefficient. And it fits exactly what we expected from neoclassical theory. Now,
2031280	2036720	they got a lot of pushback initially, but that was a major reason for why it became so popular,
2036720	2040960	because the results looked very strong and they supported neoclassical theory.
2041760	2048240	But the entire formula was based on a data set from 1899 to 1922.
2048240	2054560	Yep. And what Colburn Douglas did, they showed the numbers, the regression for
2058000	2068160	regressing GDP against the index for capital and the index for labor. But they said that their
2068800	2077760	change data also gave the same correlation coefficient at 0.97. And what they used was not
2077760	2083600	what we do use today, which is the annual change in the indices would take the log and
2083600	2086880	the log difference. Or you'd, they'd look at percentage rate of change and say,
2086880	2094080	what's the percentage rate of change? That, when you do it, and this is where I start finding a
2094080	2100080	bit of, you know, there's a hole in the bucket, derelizor, derelizor. The correlation coefficient
2100160	2108880	that they claimed was 0.97 for exactly the same value of alpha. So you got a, you know,
2108880	2115280	higher at confirming, you didn't just get the high correlation with what's your GDP and out labor
2115280	2119680	and capital, which are all growing. Okay. So there's a good, you know, the fact that they're all
2119680	2123760	rising at the one time will give you a higher correlation. They said same correlation coefficient,
2123760	2128640	same value for alpha. When I do it over the alpha minus 0.15.
2129680	2134160	And why is that? Because they didn't use the annual, the percentage change. They used the
2134160	2139600	three year moving average. And I don't know, there would be, you know, we can't, I wouldn't
2139600	2145840	be able to find the original notes, but it wasn't the, the same result that they got for the
2146720	2151680	data, which was all rising at one time. And any statistician will tell you that if you have data,
2151680	2154720	which is all rising, you're going to get a high correlation coefficient
2154720	2157840	just because they're all growing, not because they're related to each other.
2158640	2162560	So we should be looking for the differences and try to get something where the trend
2162560	2168080	should be around zero. And, and even that doesn't apply to the first differences here.
2168080	2173440	But it's, in other words, they didn't get the results that people accepted that they did.
2173440	2176640	And the confidence people had in their results wasn't justified.
2177520	2186800	But people were confident. Like in the 1930s and 1940s, this was considered a valid and profound
2186800	2193200	explanation of the inputs and outputs of an economic system describing our wealth and productivity.
2193200	2197680	Yeah. Now we had all sorts of other approaches to how you model production in the meantime.
2197680	2203440	And there was a long time, and this actually still applied when I was doing my PhD back in the 1980s
2204240	2210320	or 1990s, that the neoclassical economists were doing what they call computable general
2210320	2215360	equilibrium models. And these models had an input-output table as part of their production
2215360	2219120	system. Now that's all sorts of issues for them, which we dig in that's
2220160	2224720	tangential to what we're talking about. But at the same time, you had the rise of the,
2224720	2229440	what they call, called themselves the new classical economists. And these were neoclassical
2229440	2234960	economists who wanted to revive the idea of the market economy being perfectly flexible,
2234960	2241840	get rid of this nasty Keynesian stuff. And they started using, much more commonly,
2241840	2246320	the Cobb-Douglas production function, because they replaced an input-output model for the
2246320	2252160	production today with the idea of production over time. And they went back to a single commodity
2252160	2256480	idea. This is the aggregate production function. Of course, they used the Cobb-Douglas production
2256480	2261920	function. Now, we've had 30 or 40 years of that, and typical neoclassicals, they don't know their
2261920	2266160	own history. They've forgotten they ever used anything different to that. And all of them
2266160	2273280	use a Cobb-Douglas production function. And they've all done what Solo brought in in the 1950s.
2273280	2279120	And that's bringing in what they call technological change as part of the system. So they have
2279120	2284160	output as a product of the state of technology, which they use the capital that are A for,
2284160	2292080	multiplied by labor to 1 minus alpha times capital to alpha. And that's where I think
2292080	2295840	everything went wrong. Not that there was already going wrong with Cobb-Douglas, but
2295840	2299440	this is where you got myths taking over economics. Well, it was already going wrong with Adam Smith.
2300080	2305680	Yeah. It's era after era. I can define economics as compound era.
2305840	2314240	All right. We're going to eventually translate all this because I'm mostly tracking with,
2314800	2320160	I mean, you're an economist and you're a friend and you care about the system of humans and our
2320160	2326960	planet. But you're also here, you're functioning as a historian, which is a totally separate skill
2327680	2333440	that you have. And I've talked to you offline on what you've all been working on. And it's
2333520	2340240	quite the detective story. So keep going and bring us up to the present. So what did Solo do?
2340240	2344560	Well, you started with the Cobb-Douglas having their function was a constant,
2344560	2351520	multiplied by alpha the 1 minus alpha times K to the alpha as the production function.
2351520	2358960	Now, then one of the criticisms that was made of Cobb-Douglas by other neoclassicals is always
2358960	2366720	technological change here. And Solo said, well, we can bring technological change in. This is in 1956
2366720	2373280	and says 57. We can bring it in. And the way we have to do it, there's a cost to actually read
2373280	2377840	them here. The new wrinkle I want to describe is an elementary way of segregating variations in
2377840	2382880	output per head due to technical change than those due to changes in the availability of
2382880	2388480	capital per head. Naturally, every additional bit of information has its price. In this case,
2388480	2394160	the price consists of one new required time series to the share of labor in total income
2394880	2400720	and one new assumption. And here we go. That factors are paid their marginal products.
2402160	2409040	There was rather than being a mathematical derivation by Cobb-Douglas that alpha is 0.25 and
2409040	2415920	1 minus alpha is 0.75. Let's just assume that they're what the current values of the share of
2415920	2422080	labor and capital in output are. Alpha is 0.3, which means capital is to get 30% of output and
2422080	2429520	labor gets 0.7. So we just assume that. And then we fit the data to the, we have a data series for
2429520	2435760	labor, a data series for capital, a data series for GDP. We don't have technology. So the gap
2435760	2444160	between the result we get for GDP and the sum of labor and capital is what they call the growth
2444160	2451760	of technological change. And that ended up being 0.85. So 85% of the variation in output
2451760	2457840	was explained not by the proportions of labor and capital to each other, but by this technological
2457840	2464240	component. And that became known as a solar residual. So hold on a second. So from 1928 onwards,
2464960	2473280	they had 75% was described by labor and 25% by capital of our productivity.
2473280	2480400	Productivity is basically could be, could be said our wealth change year over year. Then
2481120	2488960	30 years later, they changed it and said that 85% is, is unexplained, but it's by some change in
2488960	2497840	technology. Yeah. And how does technology, how does technology in, in, in, in solos definition
2497840	2501120	versus your definition, how does technology differ from capital?
2501760	2505200	Well, this is the problem. Technology, in my opinion, is embodied in the capital.
2507280	2511520	In that sense, when we have technological change, we get as new machines that have a
2511520	2517840	higher capacity to process energy and produce more complex goods than the previous ones had.
2517840	2523760	So Cobb and Douglas were, in that sense, right, not to differentiate out technology and capital,
2523760	2529600	but by solar bringing in this idea of a residual. First of all, he assumed that the
2529680	2534320	exponents for labor and capital were given by income distribution data. By that stage,
2534320	2542880	it was 30% going to capitals rather than 25%. So he did do data from, from the 1920s to the 1950s
2542880	2548800	at the, the 0.25, 0.75 shifted to 0.3 and 0.7. That's what he found when he's looking at his,
2548800	2552960	his, in his paper, he does include the national distribution of income. And it's pretty much
2552960	2559440	the 30%, 70% capitalists and workers. But he found, he looked at the numbers and said,
2559440	2565120	wait a minute, there's something not right here. And when you find a residual of something,
2565120	2571280	a residual effect, sometimes it's 5% or 10%. But in his case, it was 85%.
2571280	2577360	85%. The vast majority of the productivity was not just, could not be described by capital and
2577360	2584160	labor. Well, actually 87.5% national paper. And that's, that's okay in one sense. You can say,
2584160	2588480	well, the most of our improvement isn't because of adding more labor or more capital or getting
2588480	2594160	the ratio between labor and capital correct. It's technological change. But fundamentally,
2594160	2599280	that was because technological change turns up on the machines. And you think the labor component,
2599280	2605680	when we're talking about unskilled workers, you basically have people working on a process line.
2606240	2611040	I've actually done that at some stage in my youth. But, you know, you just get told,
2611040	2615920	now press this button, pull this lever, press that put that, dig that hanging magic and that
2615920	2621520	watch them or call it. And that's your role. Okay. So what, where the technological change
2621520	2626160	actually turns up as the machine itself. So if you go back before I worked as a manual
2627360	2635040	hand inside a factory, one search, you would have used rivets to weld aluminium together. And now
2635040	2641440	you're using spot welding machines. And so the technology is actually embodied in the machinery.
2641440	2648480	And this is where the confusion of machines with money becomes a reason why you,
2648480	2653840	your mind gets clouded if you don't distinguish the two. But the terms we use, capital for machinery
2653840	2659440	and capital for money, and capitalists for the social class, does confuse the matters.
2659440	2661760	And what I'm talking about is progressive confusion.
2662480	2668240	Yeah, I'm a little confused myself now, but I know you're telling a really important story,
2668240	2674160	which you outlined to me on the phone. I mean, on our call earlier this week. So keep going.
2675040	2685200	And by the way, from Marx onward, Marx and Cobb and Douglas and Solo in the 1950s,
2685920	2692240	they're all using terms like land and capital and technology. And the word energy is found nowhere
2693120	2696400	in these papers, correct? The only one who really does, I mean, for example,
2696400	2703680	Marshall talks about energy. He uses the word 79 times in his Principles of Economics. Every last
2703680	2709680	time talking about the innovative spirit of humans, not energy. Right, energy is our,
2709680	2715840	is our, yeah, not fossil energy, but the human spirit. Yeah, human spirit. So he actually talked
2715840	2724240	about energy as various raw materials, which of course contain energy, coal and oil as inputs.
2724880	2729440	But when it came to talking about energy itself, there was no awareness of the theories of
2729440	2736000	thermodynamics or the, the role of energy as a production force. Whereas in Marx, Marx was actually
2736000	2741280	reading the early thermodynamic workers and going to lectures in London and so on. So there's more
2741280	2746480	awareness of the role of energy in Marx than there is in the neoclassicals. But what's happened
2746480	2750880	is energies dropped completely out of the picture at this stage. So first of all, Cobb and Douglas
2750880	2757440	give you a theory of production, which fits the marginal productivity theory of income distribution.
2758080	2762320	They give you coefficients, which are what neoclassicals expect them to do,
2762320	2767120	but they're derived from the data. And then along comes a cell and said, let's assume those
2767120	2774480	coefficients are correct. So the marginal product of labor is 0.7 and it is equal to their
2774480	2780320	contribution, their share of GDP. And then let's work out the residual on, oh my God,
2780320	2785200	87.5. But that's okay. We're talking about technological change. But it was an unnecessary
2785200	2790080	fudge. And it then shielded neoclassical economists from looking at the data again
2790640	2798560	to see whether the share of workers in GDP is equivalent to the contribution that labor
2798560	2806160	makes to output and capital makes to output. And that's where it goes all orry, because when you
2806160	2813360	take a look at the data that solar was looking at and data subsequent to that, and you do a regression
2813360	2818160	based on the change in white GDP, the change in labor and change in capital,
2818800	2824320	rather than getting a coefficient for labor of capital of 0.3, which is close to the income
2824320	2830880	distribution, you get a coefficient for capital of 0.85. And that suddenly means hang on a sec,
2830880	2837120	we've got a contradiction between an empirically derived term for the contribution of capital to
2837120	2844080	output and the theory of income distribution. The return to capital is actually much higher.
2844800	2852400	So the the exponent for capital is much higher than capital share in GDP. And suddenly,
2853040	2858880	we would have seen this if solar hadn't jumped in with the idea of separating our technological
2858880	2868480	change from capital itself. So that was like red herring that took us down a different flawed
2868480	2874640	pathway on understanding the production function. So what happened after? Go ahead.
2874640	2881040	We're leaving energy out all the way through. So what we have is in the neoclassical camp,
2881600	2886960	the idea that labor and capital get the payment of the labor and capital affects
2886960	2892000	their marginal product becomes just ingrained in the mindset of neoclassicals. And they stick
2892000	2899280	with the coefficients that that solar first worked on in 1957, and half a century still today,
2899280	2903920	still today, they haven't changed them. So if you look in any almost any neoclassical paper,
2903920	2909520	it will assume the exponent for capital is 0.3, and the exponent for labor is 0.7.
2909680	2915680	Using data that's that's solo used from 1928 to 1950s.
2915680	2919120	Yeah, if anybody's smart, they might go and take a look at the income distribution and find that
2919120	2925280	capital now gets 40% and labor gets 60%. So they change to the 0.4 and 0.6. But they simply
2925280	2929440	assume they can use the income distribution data to choose what the exponents are on the
2929440	2936560	production function. When you're getting a PhD in economics today, or when you were in school,
2936560	2943520	was it a requirement to read these fundamental papers of Marshall and Cobb Douglas and Marx and
2943520	2948880	no, no, I mean, that's one of the reasons why neoclassical economics has gone so totally off
2948880	2955280	the rails, they don't even know their own history. And so they did, if you go to a like when I went
2955280	2960960	through, you had to sit through master's courses on advanced micro and advanced macro and so on,
2960960	2967680	they were part of, there's now what's called an America ABD, all but dissertation. So you do,
2967680	2973520	and the American system has enormous coursework load, and I'm not sure, thankfully, they didn't
2973520	2977680	go through the American system. But I think something like two thirds of your time is spent
2977680	2984320	doing courses rather than writing a thesis. And in you don't go back, the oldest paper you might
2984320	2990720	read is one where the Lucas critique was developed in the 1970s. So they just don't know their own
2990720	2998240	history. What's the Lucas critique? There's another rabbit hole, but arguing that microeconomic
2998240	3002960	macro should be based on micro, that's the fundamental idea behind the Lucas critique.
3004080	3013280	Okay, so from Adam Smith, to Marx, to Marshall, to Cobb and Douglas, to Solo,
3013840	3022080	we've had a progression away from the physiocrats of something physical. Back in France,
3022080	3029760	it was land and the free energy from the earth. And then we had a bonanza of fossil carbon added
3029760	3035840	to our economic system. What happened next? Solo all the way to the present day, or was there
3035840	3040160	another? Solo all the way to the present day, in terms of production and function that neoclassicals
3040160	3045760	use. And then, of course, energy, we've got to bring our people back to energy all the time,
3045760	3050400	because the thing is, what happened to energy? We know energy is absolutely critical for production,
3051120	3056560	but it's left out of these theories. And you then had a group of non-orthodox economists,
3057600	3064000	Bob Ayers being the main one, a physicist who became fascinated with economics, and then
3064000	3067680	realized economics didn't include the role of energy and thought we've got to bring energy
3067760	3072320	into production, working with Coomble and quite a range of other non-orthodox economists.
3072320	3076720	I know both Bob and Reiner. And so did I. And you. Yeah.
3076720	3079840	So for our Bob Harding, what about three, four weeks ago?
3080560	3084240	I know. I know. I saw that. Maybe two months ago. Now, I'm glad I got to see him.
3084960	3090320	Would have been only two months before he died in Holland at a conference that we caught up.
3091360	3095360	So working with Bob, I thought we've got to bring energy in. There simply has to be a way
3095440	3101360	of bringing energy into production. And what Coomble and Bob were doing was, at some point,
3101360	3106880	they went from using total numbers to index numbers in what they call the Linux production
3106880	3111600	function. This was the attempt to bring energy in, but through the legs of the Cobb Douglas
3111600	3119200	production function. So at some point, they had the idea of index number values for output, labor,
3119200	3123760	energy and capital being part of the way they derived the Linux function.
3123760	3130080	And my discomfort was that fundamentally what they were doing, and this is what neoclassicals
3130080	3135120	themselves have also done, is add energy in as an additional factor of production.
3135120	3139200	So you see the way you produce output is you combine labor and capital and energy.
3140720	3147840	Now, there's two problems with that. One is that if you combine labor independently and
3147840	3152160	machinery independently and energy-produced independently, you don't have output. You've
3152160	3159040	got an explosion. Energy has to be an input to labor and capital. And so what finally occurred
3159040	3164480	to me, literally while being in Bob, is this flat in France, which was full of statues,
3164480	3169920	the walking through it one day and a trip from the bathroom, the little thought popped in my brain,
3169920	3175360	labor without energy is a corpse, capital without energy is a sculpture. And bang, that's it.
3175360	3181760	And I sat down at a table, five minutes typing in a program called MathCat, as it happens,
3181760	3187840	and feed that into the Cobduckers production function. So the basic idea was that energy is
3187840	3193200	not an independent factor. It's a factor you have to input to labor in one form and input
3193200	3196880	into machinery in a different form. Otherwise, they can't produce anything.
3196880	3204160	So it said differently, the laborers need food and housing and shelter and such,
3204160	3210960	and the machine's capital need to be turned on and powered by electricity or heat or movement,
3212000	3215680	absolutely requires energy. Without energy, the machines are worthless.
3215680	3220080	Yeah. Now, what then happened out of that was that in the Cobduckers production function,
3221200	3228080	if I fed energy as an input to labor, the basic point was that the number of workers you've got
3228080	3233360	times how much energy they consume multiplied by how much of that energy is used in production.
3233360	3239120	Now, if we go back to the days of the Roman slaves, most of the energy they consumed went
3239120	3248000	into production. Now, Feta-Pittons worked to the bone, and therefore, if they got given like
3248000	3254480	200 watts equivalent of energy input, they could put out 100 watts output, and so their factor is
3254480	3259520	50%. But if you fast forward today, you and I are surrounded by energy. We're consuming tens of
3259600	3266480	thousands of watts of energy in our houses with our devices, the heating, hot water, etc., etc.
3266480	3270960	But only a tiny amount of our energy actually now goes into production. And fundamentally,
3270960	3276160	the amount of physical work we can do runs out at about 100 watts. And I'm terrible on the terms,
3276160	3281760	by the way, being an economist, I haven't been properly trained on the terms of energy and
3281760	3286320	watts and jewels and so on. So I'll make all sorts of mistakes there. But the basic point is
3286320	3293200	the energy input of a worker to production is in terms of actual measures of energy is no greater
3293200	3298880	than it was 2000 years ago because we haven't evolved in any sense to be able to consume more
3298880	3304080	energy and output more energy. On the other hand, machinery has had an incredible increase in the
3304080	3312240	energy input that I mean, sharing can take. My favorite instance, I like what Musk is doing
3312240	3318640	with SpaceX. So I'm a bit of a space junkie. And a friend of mine was being abusive about this
3318640	3324720	last rocket blowing up. And I finally, I worked out what was the energy equivalent of the energy
3324720	3331120	inside that rocket was one third of a Hiroshima bomb. Now, for that to actually not lead to an
3331120	3337280	explosion, the devastated Boca Chica, but led to a rocket taking off and reaching 100 kilometers
3337360	3343680	above the surface in a few minutes, that is the amount of energy that the ultimate machine of
3343680	3351440	our day can consume. If you go back to James Watt steam engine, it was about 30 tons of coal a day.
3353600	3358400	Now, that's a dam site less than one third of a Hiroshima Hiroshima bomb. So most of what we've
3358400	3363360	seen is a growth in our wealth, our growth in the consumption levels we have have come from that
3363360	3367840	increase in energy. And now we're now we're cooking with gas in that sense, because we're
3367840	3371680	finally we're acknowledging the role of energy in production. But that's what may not what
3371680	3383840	neoclassicals doing, of course. So this was a story of kind of false turns at at intersections all
3383840	3390480	the way. And now, what would what would a neoclassical economist listening to this
3391280	3400640	last 45 minutes of say to you in in rebuttal or defense or contradiction or alarm?
3400640	3404320	I'm going to get a bit of fun here. Rudy, if you're listening, Rudy Bachman
3404960	3410800	sold me the case of saying what a neoclassical economist would say by actually saying what he
3410800	3416160	said in a paper, because now I'm going to come down to how have economists on the very few occasions
3416160	3420080	they've tried to include energy in a Cobb Doctor's production function, what they've done and
3420400	3425840	therefore deduced about the role of energy and production. And I really think I haven't got
3425840	3431200	a sense of him, but I laugh at him all the time. So I want to show what I do that. So Bachman and
3431200	3437040	Co, about three or four authors wrote a paper for German, a German work language working
3437040	3442720	paper with an English translation on the issue of what's going to happen to output in GDP of
3442720	3449280	Germany, if we're caught off from Russian energy during the Ukraine war. And the argument they
3449280	3454560	made was that was done by saying, we're going to include energy in the Cobb Doctor's production
3454560	3460160	function. Now what they did, and this is where the mistakes compound upon mistakes, is they took
3460160	3469520	the standard coefficients of 0.7 and 0.3 and then said, let's allocate 0.04 of the capital's
3469520	3475280	coefficient to energy. So you still got the same homogenous production. Because energy is four percent
3475360	3482880	of four percent of GDP. Therefore, okay, the coefficient is 0.04. And this is where you get
3482880	3488800	the total, this is where the twist comes in. Because the coefficient is 0.04, the mathematics
3488800	3493520	of the Cobb Doctor's production function that entails you, that the contribution of energy
3493520	3500800	to change in output is also 0.04. But all of the labor and all the machinery is fully dependent
3500800	3505200	on the energy. Far more important. Now here, I'm going to get some quotes out of Rudy here.
3505200	3513600	Okay. So they compared their work to the, what's called the Lyontia production function,
3513600	3517600	which we haven't even mentioned yet, but I'll bring that in now. And Lyontia,
3517600	3521920	vassally Lyontia, was one of the few winners of the Nobel Prize that I absolutely applaud.
3521920	3527760	He was a Russian mathematician, stroke economist, and he gave us input, output analysis, and a whole
3527760	3533840	range of other positive contributions. But when looking at the ratio, a good level of capital,
3533840	3538320	a level of output in most economies doing whatever, how other than others were developed,
3538880	3544480	what he realized was the ratio of labor to capital to output was roughly constant,
3544480	3548480	different between different countries, very different between developing and developed
3548480	3553040	countries. But generally speaking, the ratio, whichever your way was roughly constant. And
3553040	3557440	he then said you could use that as an aggregate production function. So rather than saying the
3557440	3563440	aggregate level of output is, you know, labor to one power times capital one minus that power,
3563440	3568480	you said output is capital divided by capital output ratio. And it was just an empirical
3568480	3575040	regularity. And the post Keynesian school, which I'm part of, basically said that'll be our production
3575040	3580560	function. So rather than the complicated neoclassical with, you know, exponents and marginal products,
3580560	3586720	et cetera, et cetera, we just say output is K divided by V. And V, normally in terms of the
3586720	3591920	conventional figure, people normally used about point about three for the value of V. So output
3591920	3597600	each year is one third the value of capital that same year. And that's what near and then we get
3597600	3603120	ridiculed for that. And because it's all you don't enable the possibility of substitution between
3603120	3607520	labor and capital as input. So you must be less sophisticated than we are with the
3608240	3611920	production function that can enable for substitution of labor for capital.
3612640	3618000	So Rudy then dived in, and Rudy, which I've dived in this and took a look and compared
3618000	3623520	the Cobb Douglas production function to the Leontief using a form which is called constant
3623520	3628480	elasticity of substitution. But I won't go into that basically in regard the Cobb Douglas is one
3628480	3636880	extreme of that and the Leontief at the other. And they said that if you, if you have the
3636880	3642240	standard Cobb like this production function, then it tells you to have a 10% fall in energy
3642240	3651600	inputs, you will have a 0.4% fall in GDP. So we lose 10% of our energy and GDP goes down by 0.4%.
3652160	3659760	Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's ridiculous. I know. You and I both know that's ridiculous. But he didn't
3659760	3666560	know that because they don't look at the data. So what they then said was that, and this is the
3666560	3671440	quote from Rudy's paper, it's in the heading as extreme scenarios with low elasticity of
3671440	3679600	substitution and why Leontief production at the macro level is nonsensical. So they had the blue
3679600	3684560	dashed line and the figure shows that output falls one for one with energy supply into the Leontief
3684560	3689520	case. The marginal product of energy jumps to one over alpha, which is the exponent they use for it,
3689520	3694400	so one over 0.04. Well, the marginal products of the other factors falls to zero and then
3694400	3700480	is an assumption. If factor prices equal marginal products, this then implies the price of energy
3700480	3705920	jumps to one over alpha and prices of others fall to zero. This also implies expenditure energy
3705920	3710800	jumps to 100%, blah, blah, blah. We consider these predictions to be economically nonsensical.
3711440	3716800	They are, but not because the Leontief case is wrong. The Leontief actually fits the data.
3716800	3721200	It's because the assumption that wages equal marginal product of labor is wrong.
3722160	3727520	So it's an empirical contradiction of the neopastical theory of production.
3729040	3737040	And the basic argument is that they think that production is quite insensitive to energy. That's
3737040	3744720	also a quote from the paper. So because the exponent of 0.04, that means that 10% change in
3744720	3752240	energy causes 0.4% change in output. So labor is far more significant than capital
3752240	3758560	second and energy of far distant third. When you look on the data, energy is 100% of the answer.
3759600	3765280	Explain that. I mean, what is the truth based on all your work with Bob Ayers and Reiner Kuhl
3765280	3773920	and others? What is the actual equation of labor and capital and whatever other variables?
3773920	3779920	The basic truth is that the output is fundamentally energy transformed into a useful form.
3780560	3787040	If you take a look at the rate of growth of energy, the rate of change of energy,
3787040	3793360	and the rate of change of GDP at the global level, you find a correlation coefficient for them.
3793360	3801200	I'm looking for this now of 0.7 roughly. And the relationship between change in GDP
3801280	3809120	and change in energy is 0.97 times change in energy. So in other words, fundamentally,
3809120	3817200	what GDP is, is energy transformed into useful work. And so the core flawed assumption, which is
3817200	3830640	taken, built upon some basic flawed assumptions and changed over centuries, is that we can describe
3830640	3836080	our wealth. I mean, it's almost like there's been a supernova the last two centuries of energy
3836080	3840960	use and wealth and productivity. And people are just trying to scramble in real time putting
3840960	3850480	math equations on that and increasingly divorced from the truth because the supernova keeps growing.
3851680	3860400	And so the energy blindness is that adding more energy, particularly energy dense,
3861200	3868160	fossil energy to the whole thing every year, that itself, that little addition of more energy
3868160	3873840	is a big explainer of our productivity. It's the fundamental explainer. And therefore, if we,
3873840	3877760	and what we've really done over time is develop machines which can handle more and more energy,
3878400	3883040	more and more precisely, that's where our wealth has come from. And we've, again, economists have
3883040	3888320	been blind to that by having this, first of all, inversion by David Smith to throw out the physiocrats
3888320	3893600	and say, labor is the source of value. And then you have the neoclassical saying it's labor and
3893600	3901440	capital. Then you had Cobb and Douglas saying it's 0.7 and 0.3, which means that the contribution
3901440	3908080	of labor to change in output is 70%. And the contribution of capital is 30%. That then gets
3908080	3914080	locked in by a solo to turning their empirical nondiscovery into an assumption and then putting
3914080	3920400	it all in technological change which becomes disembodied from capital itself, but also hides
3920400	3925360	them from the fact that the relationship doesn't hold up on the data anymore anyway. And now,
3925360	3929360	when they come bringing energy, they just tack it on as a third factor and give it a coefficient
3929360	3936000	based on the percentage of energy in GDP, which is trivially low, and therefore say energy has
3936000	3942080	almost no role in production, which is complete bollocks. And part of the reason is that the
3942160	3950960	energy input into our machines and into our economy is only the cost of energy that it is to
3950960	3958160	extract, plus a little profit for the oil company or whatever. It's not the value that it provides,
3958160	3963280	which is four or five years of my physical labor and all that.
3964240	3973760	Yeah, I mean, seriously, this is Nobel Prize sort of observation,
3974560	3982160	I think, because it's so decoupled from what people say at high positions of authority in our
3982160	3990240	world. Again, I'll ask you what is just a standard economist, not Rudy, someone you know, but just
3990240	3996480	anyone listening to this who has a PhD in economics or maybe someone who's in grad school
3996480	4000720	getting a master's or a PhD in economics listening to this program,
4002320	4009120	is their initial reaction going to be one of critical rejection? Steve doesn't know what
4009120	4015120	he's talking about, or is it like, yeah? Absolutely. I mean, because it affects their
4015200	4019040	identity or because they know otherwise in their research? It affects their identity. I mean,
4019920	4024160	if a younger one might actually go, oh, hang on, that's surprising, you'll get a few who might
4024160	4029280	react that way and change, but the old ones are locked in their ways. Okay, so speak to the
4029280	4035440	young ones right now. If they're curious about this and something doesn't sit right with what
4035440	4042960	they've been told and what they've just heard, what would you recommend that they do to get clarity
4042960	4048720	on the truth? The main thing is to realize that economics can't be derived from the laws of
4048720	4053360	thermodynamics, but it can't be inconsistent with them either. And what you're being taught within
4053360	4058720	your production functions and so on is leaving out the role of energy in an absolutely critical way.
4058720	4062080	Now, if you go and want to do it empirically, you're going to take a look at what is the
4062080	4067600	relationship between energy and production, drive it empirically, and you'll find that
4068320	4074640	it's somewhere between like a point in GDP is 0.7 to say 0.95 minus 0.97 as I got in that particular
4074640	4083040	Excel regression of the value of change in GDP. So the fundamental insight from a thermodynamical
4083040	4089440	point of view within economics is that the first to a first approximation, GDP is energy
4089440	4095520	turned into useful work. And then that means that the whole argument you were taught in
4095520	4100640	neoclassical economics that the wage reflects the marginal product of labor is completely wrong.
4101200	4107360	The wage and the return to capital for that matter have nothing to do with their contribution to
4107360	4113920	production. What labor and capital do is harness energy successfully in factories to produce output.
4114720	4119120	And that will normally be done with machines that machines have very
4119840	4127280	fixed ratios of per workers per machine and energy throughput per machine. So fundamentally,
4127280	4133040	you get a fixed ratio on that sense. Leonty is an empirical observation we now have an explanation
4133040	4141280	for that explanation is that the Leonty production function is actually output is equal to machinery
4141280	4145600	multiplied by the efficiency with which machines turn energy into useful work.
4146560	4153280	Neoclassical economists I mean back when I was in school are among the smartest people in my class
4153280	4162880	and smart people can be fooled, but they're not dumb. So like really, it still today boggles
4162880	4170320	my mind how neoclassical economists can totally neglect energy given anyone with three minutes
4170320	4178400	on the internet can find that a barrel of oil has 5.7 million BTUs in it, which is a lot of energy
4178400	4184480	relative to the 0.6 kilowatt hours that I do per day. So what do they really think this?
4185200	4189440	They really do and the trouble is this is where your mind gets set by your training.
4189440	4193520	So if you get trained on the idea that production is a combination of technology,
4193520	4198560	labor and capital and energy doesn't even turn up there, you don't even think about energy and
4198560	4203520	you can be completely energy blind in the sense that I now lead that book with that it would like
4203520	4207280	where we know humans know better much about energy as fish do about water,
4207280	4212320	they simply take it for granted. And then you see this when neoclassicals actually come to pose
4212320	4215920	themselves the question of what is the role of energy in production. So this is again,
4215920	4222080	this is from the paper by Back When and Co about the impact of the loss of Russian energy on German
4222080	4227760	output and they to take the Klobdokos production function and differentiate it with respect to
4227760	4234880	the inputs and then say that we can say what's going to happen to GDP from a change in energy
4234880	4240320	and here's a quote from the paper. Therefore, for example, a drop in energy supply of minus 10
4240320	4247360	percent reduces production by 0.4 percent, which shows that production is quite insensitive to
4247360	4256400	energy as expected. This is expected. Production is quite insensitive to energy as expected.
4258000	4265040	Expected on neoclassical economists. Right, it's a tautology of sorts. It's a tautology. They think
4265040	4269920	that energy has a trivial role because it has no role in their production function. But when you
4270640	4278160	revise it... Why aren't there people calling them on this? Like a... Well, I am. The Prime Minister
4278160	4285680	or a Senator or a CEO. They all do one unit of economics. They all get the idea of labor and
4285680	4290560	capital producing output and the production function if they go that detailed in first year.
4290560	4296560	But fundamentally, they get taught the whole idea that we get paid our factor products and that
4296560	4303520	actually ideologically is very reinforcing for a CEO because it says my enormous weight per salary
4303520	4308880	is because of my huge contribution to production. So it ends up having an ideological role and that
4308880	4317120	lines them to the physical reality that you simply don't have that impact on production.
4317120	4321520	If you come down to the nuts and bolts of it, it's energy which is producing the output
4321600	4326160	and you are getting a share of it and now an overblown share given your system and the power
4326160	4333440	structure of capitalism. So if we truly defined energy correctly in the production function,
4334240	4341600	that giant gift from nature might not all be funneled to the top the way it is now.
4342160	4347360	And that of course leads to one of the reasons why people continue being energy blind because
4347360	4354720	it enables them to be blind to their outsized share of the wealth of the civilization
4354720	4363440	that goes their way. And also continues to indicate why we're blind to the waste component
4364480	4369760	as well because if you include that, that reduces. Yeah. The other side of the production
4369760	4376160	function is waste and when I do the ontario function which makes sense with the empirical
4376400	4381360	interpretation or the logical reinterpretation of the empirical regularity of the ontario
4381360	4387200	that output is capital divided by capital output ratio, the coming output is capital times the
4387200	4393760	efficiency with which machines turn energy into useful work, that coefficient is going to be less
4393760	4400640	than 0.5, substantially less than 0.5. So it means most of what we've used is waste, waste energy.
4400640	4406160	It can quantify it and say if the energy, the efficiency with which machines turn energy
4406160	4414480	useful work is about roughly 0.2 or 0.25, then 0.8 to 0.75 is of energy input produces waste.
4415440	4419440	And that's what we dump into the environment and that of course feeds back and damages our
4419440	4426160	capacity to produce output. If we had that inside 50 or 60 years ago, we would never have got to
4426160	4432560	the conundrum where we are now overlying so much upon fossil fuel energy for our production today.
4433360	4439440	Okay. I'm going to ask you an easier question but it might be a harder question for you specifically,
4439440	4450000	Steve. What would you tell to a graduate student learning about the world in another discipline
4450000	4457840	like philosophy or French or chemistry or biology who will never take a class in economics?
4461040	4467920	Can you, to those people, why is it important that energy underpins the production function
4467920	4474320	and that our economists and therefore our politicians and such have been misled about the
4475040	4479360	the core driver of our wealth the last century plus?
4480240	4485520	Fundamentally, humans as the lasation only exists because we exploit energy. If we didn't have
4485520	4492160	energy in the form of the coal and oil deposits we found, we would still be sitting around
4492160	4499680	fireplaces starting fires with flints. We might have moderately sophisticated culture to the
4499680	4506320	stage that you got with your animal power and slave power under Romans and the medieval period
4506320	4511360	and serfs and so on. But there wouldn't be the philosophy, there wouldn't be the art,
4511360	4515920	there wouldn't be the computers that we take for granted today. So if we don't understand
4515920	4519120	the role of energy, we don't understand where our civilization came from.
4519760	4528400	And how does your view and that of Bob Ayers and Reiner Kuml and other what we might call
4528400	4535040	biophysical economists or in your case post-Kinsey economists, how does your current
4535040	4541600	understanding of energy and the production function differ from the biophysical economists
4541600	4551360	that started to gain traction in the 1970s? You know, Howard O'odham and George Eskewer-Roligan
4551360	4556400	and Charlie Hall and such. Is it nuance? Is it different?
4556720	4559840	It is just basically finding a better way to put it together. I mean, for example,
4559840	4564240	Bob, of course, was in the house when I made that discovery with the listang in his flat.
4564880	4571360	And it took me 10 minutes or less to work out the mathematics. It's ridiculously simple.
4571360	4575200	But he then just said that that solves it. That rings in the role of energy.
4575760	4582640	So because he and O'Kuml had ever thought making energy and input into the labor and
4582640	4587520	capital, they had energy as a third factor. And once you've just said it's got to be an input,
4587520	4592960	it all falls apart, falls together, pardon me. I totally agree with that. But here's what I
4592960	4600240	don't understand. If we don't have energy, all technologies are sculptures. And I added to
4600240	4608400	your statement and said cities are museums. But we do have energy. And we're probably going to have
4608400	4614960	less energy in the future. But how we use that energy, how we combine that energy with materials
4614960	4623520	and human imagination and creativity, that does add something to just the raw value of the energy.
4626080	4634960	So it's the combination of machines, raw materials like copper and silicon and
4634960	4645280	phosphorus, you know, neodymium and water and phosphorus, and the fire, some electrons or flame,
4645280	4652000	either kinetic or potential energy. And that comes up with a product that humans value.
4652960	4661360	And so how do you distinguish the contribution of actually the flame or the electrons versus
4662160	4667200	the machine and the new invention? I'm actually going to go right back to 1774
4667760	4672000	and give you an explanation for that. And I quote this in my new book, because I think
4672000	4677600	Turgo wrote one of the most brilliant paragraphs in the history of economics. And I just wish this
4677600	4682720	had been where economics came from rather than 1776, two years later, with Adam Smith. So pardon
4682720	4687440	me, reading out a substantial slapper and looking above the camera to do it. The husband and the
4687760	4693600	mistakes are seen as just being with agriculture as any production system, including manufacturing,
4693600	4697760	obviously. The husband and the man is the only person whose labor produces something over and
4697760	4702640	above the wages of labor. He is therefore the sole source of all wealth. The land pays him
4702640	4706960	directly the price of his labor, independently of any other man or agreement. Nature does not
4706960	4711440	bargain with him to oblige him to content himself with what is absolutely necessary,
4711440	4716400	what she grants his proportional neither to his wants nor would have contractual valuation of
4716400	4720800	the price of his days of labor. And this is one of the punchlines. It is the physical result of
4720800	4726560	the fertility of the soil and of the wisdom, far more than of the laboriousness of the means with
4726560	4731120	which he is employed to render it fertile. So that's the role of humans in involving
4732320	4738640	concepts, changing how we bring out the energy. As soon as the labor that the husband produces
4738640	4743920	more than his wants, he can with this superfluity that nature records him as a pure gift over and
4743920	4749280	above the wages of his toil. There's energy return and energy invested by the labors of the
4749280	4753520	other members of society. This latter and selling to him gain only their livelihood,
4753520	4759200	but the husband and gathers beyond his subsistence a wealth which is independent and disposable,
4759200	4765360	which he has not bought and which he sells. Now all the ideas we're talking about are tied
4765360	4773680	up in that one paragraph. Earlier you said you had a quote that you start with a seed and
4773680	4780560	you plant it and nature gives you back 1,000 seeds. But what if the husband was really clever
4780560	4788000	and found out a way to plant a seed and get back 2,000 seeds? The gift would still be from nature,
4788000	4791760	but it was doubled because of his creativity and intelligence.
4791760	4795280	And that's the line in the middle. It is the physical result of the fertility of the soil
4795280	4801120	and of the wisdom, far more so than the laboriousness. So in the terms of wisdom,
4801120	4807840	what he's saying is we devise new ways of doing different things and that wisdom is far more
4807840	4813520	important than the effort we put in physically to do it. So again our ideas play an essential role
4813520	4819440	and we wouldn't be able to exploit this free energy without our minds that can devise new ways
4819440	4827760	of harnessing the energy far more rapidly and far more effectively. So the wisdom is definitely in
4827840	4834480	there and the wisdom itself turns up in the machines. So it is embodied in the machines. So
4834480	4842240	all this stuff, right back in 774, that paragraph has far more wisdom than the whole world of nations.
4843040	4850480	So this is all kind of testable although we're on a roller coaster ride. So I think there's a
4850480	4857440	possibility and I know this is a totally separate conversation that we could lose
4857520	4864880	20% of our energy in coming decades for various reasons or more or more. But let's just say 20%.
4866160	4873680	So I would think that would cause a 20% or more drop in GDP. What would economists say?
4874320	4881760	They'd say, of course, 0.8% drop in GDP. 0.8. That's a strict timeless thing.
4881760	4884640	Do you think most economists actually believe that?
4884640	4888320	Yep, I do. I've worked with them for long enough to know they swallow this stuff.
4888320	4895600	So if you look at the data, like changing in GDP and changing in energy, that's figure 57 at the
4895600	4901600	moment in my book, it may change. But it's such a one-for-one relationship, it's ridiculous.
4902160	4907680	And yet they don't even look at it. And when Rudy and Berkman and friends made that comment
4908480	4915600	about the 0.10% fall in energy, 0.4% fall in GDP,
4916240	4920320	obviously they didn't look at the data. And they ridiculed Leontia when Leontia actually
4920320	4926080	reproduces the data. That would be like the opposite of a Nobel Prize. We should develop
4926080	4930320	something like that. Well, the Nobel Prize isn't the opposite of a Nobel Prize. Do you
4930400	4932640	know why? No, I don't. Okay, so there's that.
4932640	4939440	In economics, yeah. The synergy. All right, big, big picture. Let's move to the stratosphere here.
4940480	4945840	What are the implications of everything that you've said for our modern society and for our future
4946560	4949600	and for our decisions and planning for that moment?
4949600	4957600	The fundamental grounding is that without energy, there is no GDP. And we have been getting our
4957600	4962400	energy out of fossil fuel forms. And of course, with fossil fuels, we generate carbon dioxide
4962400	4966880	that is causing global warming. And that is destabilizing the climate on which our production
4966880	4973200	systems depend. And we've been blind of that, particularly the economists who so-called specialists
4973200	4977360	in climate change, William Nordhaus and friends, have no idea of this either.
4977360	4983760	So that's another flaw in the production function is there's not the waste capacity that feeds back
4983760	4989360	in to the biosphere that is our only source of wealth. Because without oxygen and
4989360	4991600	viable ecosystems, we all die.
4991600	4995760	Yeah. Now, that's not concluded in the way the neoclassicals think about climate change.
4995760	5000240	And that's why we've got nonsense statements like by Nordhaus, for example, saying that
5000240	5004800	it's really, really difficult to find any direct impacts of the expected climate change
5004800	5009760	on the bulk of the economy in the next 50 to 75 years. Now, by the bulk of the economy,
5010000	5016000	all of manufacturing, even included all of mining, services, industries, government, etc., etc.,
5016000	5021600	could see no way in which climate change will affect that. Well, if we have energy, if we get
5021600	5026560	like a blanket ban on using fossil fuels because of totally destructive change to the climate
5026560	5031040	in the next five years or so, or 10 years, there'll be an incredible plunge in GDP.
5031040	5032400	And we're not prepared for it at all.
5033440	5038640	And I think if James Hansen and his colleagues are right, we're going to have a spike in
5039520	5049200	climate warming temperatures in 2024 because we're shifting from the PDO from La Niña to El Niño
5049200	5056800	on the backs of the sulfur aerosols being reduced as a masking of the thermal inertia.
5056800	5064160	So, we're going to see. And if we go up a half a degree Celsius next year, as they're suggesting,
5064160	5068720	that's going to have massive impacts around the world. And then, yes, you're right, people are
5068720	5076000	going to be like, oh my God, this is like real and our emissions are rising and fossil energy is to
5076000	5082880	blame. But I think most people still don't understand the deep linkage between fossil
5082880	5087760	energy and the size and scope of our economy because they're energy blind.
5088320	5091680	Yeah, and economists have contributed to this blindness rather than
5091680	5098320	clarifying that it's absolutely essential. And on your previous podcast here, this is your third
5098320	5105840	appearance on this show, you predicted that economists, because of their identities and
5105840	5113520	status and built personal situation, they will not change until there's a crisis.
5114240	5120720	So, can we anticipate what's going to happen with the environment with
5122400	5128480	oil depletion, though that's going to happen gradually, with what's coming and create some
5128480	5134320	blueprints and break grass and case of emergency plans that are actually based on
5135040	5139760	what a physiocrat might advise the French king, the modern equivalent of that?
5140480	5141440	Can we do that?
5141440	5146880	I think it's incredibly late timing to be doing that. But as you know, we've depended on
5146880	5152720	fossil fuels for about 85% of our energy. And that hasn't changed much in the last 20 years.
5152720	5157520	It's gone down to some extent for some time because of growth in fossil fuel production
5157520	5163600	decline in hydroelectric, which is the main form. That's the main form of renewables,
5163600	5171760	even now as hydroelectric, it's not wind and solar. So, we're going to see
5172560	5177440	quite serious climate catastrophes coming our way. The ones with most of the climate
5177440	5182800	scientists I'm in touch with are scared about are global famine caused by a collapse in
5182800	5188240	food output from one of the wheat belts or corn belts of the world. And that then leading to
5188240	5193440	social breakdown because suddenly we haven't got the food we need. Or, you know, wet bold
5193440	5198880	catastrophes, the other one, which would hit third world countries more than it would hit
5198880	5204320	westerns probably. But something which is catastrophic, which causes a massive collapse
5204320	5210800	in population and then leads to probably rogue behavior by governments around the world then
5210800	5215920	because we haven't managed to even reach an agreement to phase our fossil fuels
5216000	5223360	at the last cop-out meeting. It'll be every country for itself in what could be a very chaotic
5223360	5228160	environment, will be a very chaotic environment if we see something like a global famine.
5228880	5234400	So, you're saying that we shouldn't look to the neoclassical economists who are the
5234400	5242000	current economic shaman and cheerleaders of our cultural narrative of the early 21st century.
5242000	5246640	We shouldn't look to them to change their minds and chart a different course.
5246640	5250560	They will be the most shocked and most confused while it happens completely. They're useless.
5250560	5256480	They've led us astray. It's just been a cascade of errors right back to Smith as I've said that
5256480	5260880	led us to the situation. But the last people have any understanding of the physical role of
5260880	5265440	production on the planet are economists. And the last ones who realize the dangers of climate
5265440	5270320	change are also economists. So, I would just like kick them out of the room. They don't belong here.
5270960	5275600	I tend to agree, but let me play devil's advocate. There are a lot of bright,
5275600	5282080	pro-future young people in college, in graduate school, in postgraduate. Couldn't some of them
5282800	5291280	take the kernels of truth bombs that you've been laying out here and contribute to the science
5292480	5299760	and understanding and translate between what you're saying and what the traditional neoclassical
5299760	5304240	economics departments around the world? I suspect your answer is going to be no, because
5305040	5309680	their boss and the people that gets the funding are the tenured economists and they're not going
5309680	5316880	to fund this sort of research. Or what do you think? It's a waste of time. I mean, some of the
5316880	5321680	young ones are worth reaching to say, look, if the cards say join rethinking economics,
5322880	5326640	fight against your curriculum. But fundamentally, if you want people to give you a guidance right
5326640	5333600	now, it's going to be the engineers. And they're the ones we should be. Get the engineers to look
5333600	5339360	at it. The first thing an engineer is going to look at is the energy supply. That's the nature
5339360	5344800	of training of engineers. It's all about how you use energy and how you direct it to produce useful
5344800	5349040	outcomes rather than blowing things up. So, the engineers are the ones we need to rely upon,
5349040	5355120	and we should have been getting them to build the alternative technologies in the last 40 or 50 years
5355120	5359840	rather than me getting a lot of them to go off and work out as financial engineers instead and
5359840	5366000	give us speculative bubbles in real estate and shares. So, we have had a huge misdirection of
5366000	5370960	our intelligence for the last 40 or 50 years. And again, economists, it'll blame for that.
5372160	5374000	When does your book come out and what's it called?
5375280	5378480	Hopefully it'll be coming out. It depends upon the publisher's process, of course,
5378480	5384400	but hopefully by March, I would say. And the title is going to be the rebuilding economics
5384400	5392800	from the top down. Well, I've read the energy chapter and it is quite compelling. Steve, you
5392800	5398960	and I talk about what's going on now in the world, but I didn't know a lot of the things that you
5398960	5404560	have dug up by reading these original papers. You also told me that most people in economics
5404560	5408560	don't even read these original papers. No, they never go back and read the original.
5408560	5416320	Yeah, originals is just terrible. Yeah. So, this was a little bit of a Sherlock Holmes treatment
5416320	5424960	of the history of the production function and the complete absence of energy in describing
5424960	5431360	our wealth and productivity. And yet, energy is embedded in everything including the labor
5431360	5437280	and capital functions. Do you have any closing words for listeners who might be a little shell
5437280	5445200	shocked by this conversation? The main thing comes down to how economists, by not understanding
5445200	5451120	energy, have trivialized the dangers of climate change. So, we are likely to see that striking
5451120	5458000	this decade. I mean, we both know the potential 0.5 degree increase in global temperatures out of
5458000	5467120	the both El Nino plus the hypothetical role of losing, leaving the sulfur emissions as
5467120	5472080	we've been masking some increase in global temperatures. That should cause absolutely
5472080	5478160	chaotic weather, probably starting in the next northern summer. So, it's going to be brutally
5478160	5483120	certain that this starts happening and we have to prepare as soon as possible that all the XR
5483120	5492000	activists dial it up. Engineers start realizing we have to, as soon as possible,
5492000	5496640	start producing whatever alternatives we can work out to reduce the amount of carbon we're
5496640	5502080	putting into the atmosphere as soon as possible. That's the most important thing to have some
5502080	5507600	potential to hang onto human civilization over the next two decades. If we don't do it, it's back
5507600	5513360	to the starting edge. Thank you, Steve, as always, to be continued, my friend, and good luck with
5513360	5521280	your book and all your future sleuthing. Indeed. If you enjoyed or learned from this episode of
