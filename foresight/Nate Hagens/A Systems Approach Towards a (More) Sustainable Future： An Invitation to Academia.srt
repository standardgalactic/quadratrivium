1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
Bienvenue. My name is Nate Higgins. I am the director of the United States

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,360
Nonprofit Energy in Our Future. I am also the host of the podcast, The Great

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,040
Simplification. Yesterday, upon the invitation of my colleague in Canada,

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:26,740
Kira Cooper, I gave a presentation to the Environmental Studies Association of

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:33,500
Canada to the Academic Congress of Canada 2024, which next week will be viewed by

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:42,880
some 10,000 to 15,000 professors and affiliates of universities. Kira was

7
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,720
gracious in allowing me to speak as long as I wanted to. So of all the

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,300
presentations I've done, this is the most comprehensive, most up-to-date. I forgot

9
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,500
a few things. I'm sure I'm missing some things. The world is changing. I'm still

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,900
learning. But if you're looking for one-stop-shop, it's about an hour and

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,980
45-minute talk. There's a brief intro by Kira, followed by a part one, the drivers

12
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,260
and constraints of our situation, the implications and scenarios followed by a

13
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:22,260
multiple-scale portfolio of potential responses by us. It is my hope that many

14
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:27,340
professors around the world start to integrate this system science of our

15
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:32,860
human predicament instead of continuing to work in silos. We need the silos, but

16
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,580
as part of a larger collective of information and cross-disciplinary

17
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:45,220
sharing, I hope you learn from this presentation and share it. It will take a

18
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:52,660
village. Here's Kira Abiento. Greetings et bienvenue au congrès 2024. Au nom de

19
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,260
l'Association canadienne d'études environnementales et de nos partenaires, j'ai le

20
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,700
grand honor de vous présenter Dr. Nate Higgins. Nate est le directeur de l'Institut

21
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,660
for the Study of Energy and our Future et haute to podcast the great

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,980
simplification. Welcome. My name is Kira Cooper and I'm the co-president of the

23
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,060
Environmental Studies Association of Canada. I wish to acknowledge that today

24
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,620
I'm speaking to you from the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee, Anishinaabe

25
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,100
and Neutral Peoples. I would also like to recognize the immense natural resources,

26
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,620
energy and human capital that make it possible for us to be here on this call.

27
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:34,860
On behalf of ESAC and our partners, I am honored to welcome Dr. Nate Higgins as

28
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,260
our 2024 Congress keynote speaker. Nate is the co-founder and director of the

29
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,420
Institute for the Study of Energy and our Future and host of the great

30
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,020
simplification podcast. He is a highly respected and widely trusted thought

31
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,940
leader and communicator extraordinaire at the nexus of energy, environment and

32
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,300
finance. I am thrilled to have Nate join us as we discuss what sustaining shared

33
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,940
futures means in these critical times. Without further ado, bienvenue and

34
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,220
welcome, Nate. Merci beaucoup, Kira. Thank you for the nice introduction. This

35
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,140
will be the longest presentation I've ever given in my life. This is a

36
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,460
culmination of 20 years of research on multiple disciplines. I know most of you

37
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:25,500
are scientists and academics and probably haven't heard some of this. Some of

38
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,300
this can be a little bit hard hitting. There will be references on every page

39
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,940
of my slides. You can watch the video later and research things. And Kira,

40
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,060
I'll offer now since we'll be on a tight timeline. I know we'll have time for

41
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,540
a few questions, but if you wanted to reconvene another time for your

42
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,380
colleagues in Canada to have a conversation and questions, I'd be happy

43
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,460
to do that. So I'm going to speak fast. There's a lot of slides. We are part of

44
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:00,180
a systems story. If you are a member of our species, which if you're watching

45
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,060
this, you are. In the 300,000 years we've been a species, there's about an eight

46
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:10,020
to 10% chance that if you're human, you're alive right now. And we've arrived

47
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:15,140
at a species level conversation, which is what I'm going to discuss today. I'm

48
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:18,380
going to have five sections, a brief introduction. I'm going to describe the

49
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,980
human ecosystem, the super organism implications and scenarios for the

50
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,980
future. And then I've got quite a long what to do section. This isn't a

51
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:35,140
prescriptive talk, but I can give ideas for direction for the world, for

52
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,500
Canada, for civil society, for the Academy and for you as individual humans.

53
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,020
Okay, a brief introduction. So those of you watching this, since this is a

54
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:55,740
scientist plenary, you have different priorities. You also want to contribute

55
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,660
to better futures for humanity. And you want to live a good life. I couldn't

56
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,100
find a transparent image of a toke here. I'm going to focus on your research

57
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,860
hat a little bit and make you think about what we need to be researching and

58
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,540
the role of the Academy in the future. And I'll come back to that at the

59
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,060
conclusion. We hear a lot of stories in the news about what's going right and

60
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,900
what's going wrong with the world. And I won't spend bandwidth here. But in

61
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,380
order to diagnose the patient and figure out what to do, we first have to

62
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,980
understand actually what's wrong and the drivers and the constraints of what we

63
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,380
face. And that's what this talk is going to be about. The two predominant

64
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:44,500
cultural narratives, at least in North America, are a green new deal. We migrate

65
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:50,500
our energy systems to 100% renewables, work towards net zero emissions, and

66
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,220
everything will be fine. There's also business as usual. There's nothing wrong

67
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,460
with our past model. There's no shortages for anything we need to

68
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:04,860
deregulate and reduce taxes. This story is going to tell a wider and deeper

69
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:12,380
history and explanation of our human predicament. From a siloed perspective,

70
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,700
there's lots of important aspects to a more sustainable future, renewable

71
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,140
energy. There's a lot of experts on that. But if we take an aerial view, we can

72
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:27,100
see that we have islands of expertise in our world that rarely talk to each

73
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:34,740
other. And that ends up meaning that we have lots of concurrent, urgent and

74
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:40,980
eloquent and erudite conversations that lack the aerial view that look at how

75
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,860
things are connected. We have islands of expertise in our cultural

76
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:51,900
conversations separated by oceans of incoherence. Okay, so how do we make

77
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:57,340
sense of things and put them together? The human ecosystem. I'm going to go

78
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:04,140
over this in several slides. We take energy, invent things, combine it with

79
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:09,660
materials, develop products, represent these in our economic system by

80
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:16,500
dollars, Canadian or US or others. And we do this all to generate the same

81
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:21,180
emotional states of our ancestors and the whole thing creates pollution. I'm

82
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,260
going to first talk about the biophysical side of this. So energy is vital in

83
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:33,580
nature. Nothing in nature moves without energy and energy is also vital in human

84
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:39,620
systems. Every single good or service in our global economic system that results

85
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:46,540
in economic growth requires energy to invent, to mine, to create, to manufacture,

86
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,100
to package, to deliver, to maintain, to repair, to run, to dispose of. There is

87
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:58,580
not a single thing that contributes to GDP that doesn't require energy. I don't

88
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,100
know about Canada, but in the United States, the average household has over 60

89
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:08,660
devices plugged in all the time, even if they're not running. And we take this

90
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:14,820
for granted. We don't see the sea of energy that we are swimming in. This is a

91
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:21,100
picture of me on my farm here in Wisconsin. That's a picture of my horse who

92
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,260
does the work of about one horse, which is 10 times more work than I can do.

93
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,980
That's my utility vehicle with a little bit of gasoline can do the work of 45

94
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,180
horses. And that's my truck with some diesel fuel can do the work of 300

95
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,980
horses. The next time you're taking a flight to Toronto or Vancouver, imagine

96
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:50,180
100,000 horses invisibly pulling that jet across the sky. This is the power and

97
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,460
the benefit that we get from this ancient carbon, which is oil. One barrel of

98
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:03,460
oil has 5.7 million British thermal units worth of energy, which equates to

99
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,820
around 1700 kilowatt hours worth of work potential compared to about 0.6

100
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,500
kilowatt hours in human daily work output. And after you do the math, that's

101
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,620
around four and a half years of physical human labor is in every barrel of oil.

102
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:28,420
We use in the global economy about 100 million barrel of oil equivalents of coal

103
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:34,220
oil and natural gas every year, which means we effectively have armies of

104
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,660
fossil helpers to the tune of 400 or 500 billion human equivalents compared to

105
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:48,220
around 4 to 5 billion actual human workers. So what this has done is underpin the

106
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:53,100
story of industrialization, where humans have replaced things we used to do

107
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,020
manually or with draft horses by adding machines. And those machines and various

108
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:05,380
technologies are all powered by energy, mostly fossil energy. And what this has

109
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:11,260
done is raised our profits and our incomes and the size of the human

110
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:16,140
enterprise. Here's an example of something in Wisconsin. We still are the dairy

111
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:23,460
state. We have cows. The benefits that we get massively increase our profits and

112
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,820
our wages. A person milking a cow spends around 30 minutes manually and makes

113
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:35,500
around $5 an hour. If you add an automated system, you're adding 180 times

114
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,100
more energy with the technology, but you're boosting the profits or the wages by

115
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,420
almost four times to $20 per hour. Then you can even take it further and add a

116
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:52,060
fully automated milking machine, which is 400 times more energy than an

117
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:58,220
individual human. And that boosts the profit to around $25 an hour. What's

118
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,100
really important and one of the key takeaways from this presentation is as

119
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:12,860
energy prices increase, very energy heavy processes like aircraft or aluminum

120
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,780
smelting, many mining things, not only become less profitable, but become

121
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:25,860
unprofitable. The left panel here, the blue, orange and gray are what happens to

122
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,700
the hand milking if prices increase, nothing. The middle example shows if

123
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,100
prices go from five cents in blue to 10 cents in orange to 15 cents a kilowatt

124
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,180
hour in gray, there's a reduction in the profits. But as you'll see in the right

125
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:48,300
panel here and a doubling of energy prices from five cents to 10 cents,

126
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:55,060
there's a massive drop in the heavy industry processes. And if we triple,

127
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,940
we're now operating at a loss. And this was started to see last year because of

128
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,300
the Ukraine war in Europe as natural gas prices spiked. Our economies are

129
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:10,460
incredibly sensitive to increases in the main input to our current global

130
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,020
enterprise, which is energy. So because of this industrialization, we have

131
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:20,700
higher wages, higher profits, lower price stuff, and economic growth for more

132
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,820
people. We actually do have more people. In the last few hundred years, we've

133
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,580
gone from a billion people to eight billion people alive today. But even more

134
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,420
dramatic is the goods and services available per person. The average human

135
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:42,940
today is 14 times materially wealthier than the average person 200 years ago.

136
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:47,460
And the average person in the United States is 50 times as wealthy as the

137
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,340
average human was 200 years ago. This doesn't account for inequalities and

138
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:58,420
such. This is just geometric arithmetic average. If you combine these two

139
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,300
stats, the human economy measured by the number of people times the average

140
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,980
goods and service consumption of those people is a thousand times bigger than

141
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:15,540
it was in the year 1500. But in our economic schools, our business schools

142
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:21,540
at McGill University, we don't teach that energy is important. We teach that

143
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:29,780
energy is its cost share of an input to a process. So $1,000 worth of oil is

144
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,660
equal to our economy as $1,000 worth of pencils or bike helmets or water bottles

145
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,300
or cupcakes. So in effect, our culture has become energy blind. This is a

146
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,380
circular economy graph that's shown in beginnings, econ 101 classes that show

147
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:52,420
that people demand things, corporations and the market produce the things. And

148
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:58,020
there's this virtuous cycle. And that's how the economy goes forward. This

149
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:02,620
cycle neglects the source of the majority of the inputs, which is the

150
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,580
non-renewable energy and materials. And it neglects the sink, which is the carbon

151
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:15,660
and other waste capacities of our planet. So our current economic system conflates

152
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:21,140
the dollar value of energy with the work value. And we largely don't include the

153
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:27,820
cost of pollution at all. We are energy blind. And if you look at what we are

154
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:34,260
doing, we are drawing down ancient carbon millions of times faster than it was

155
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:39,980
geologically sequestered and trickle charged by the son of ancient phytoplankton

156
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,860
and algae and diatoms. So we are alive during what one day may be referred to

157
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,100
as the carbon pulse. And we have 300,000 year history as a species and it might

158
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,660
look like this. Zooming in on a 20,000 year horizon, the carbon pulse might

159
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:01,300
look like this of all the coal, oil and natural gas stacked on top of each other.

160
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:07,620
Out of 1000 year period, it might look like this. And we are near the top of

161
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,580
this carbon pulse. We're somewhere between the yellow star and the red star.

162
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,700
Because energy is so important and vital from an economic perspective, we hope

163
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,340
we're near the white, the yellow star, because that means we have more decades

164
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:27,940
ahead of this cheap fossil armies to support our technology and consumption.

165
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:31,980
From a biosphere climate, which I'm going to talk about a little later

166
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,300
standpoint, we hope we're at the red star because we've been emitting this

167
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,660
this warming effect, a thermal blanket from adding this ancient carbon so fast

168
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,020
to the atmosphere that we don't want to continue to do that. But this carbon

169
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:55,220
that we've taken for granted is finite. We take out the best first, then we get

170
00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:01,060
complicated tools to get more. But it is finite and depleting quite rapidly.

171
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:07,340
The graph on the left shows a story of humans overcoming energy depletion

172
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,540
with technology. The United States peaked in oil production in 1970, decline,

173
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:18,220
decline for 40 years, and then we discovered how to frack and technology

174
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:24,780
overcame depletion. Well, a different story is using the exact same data and

175
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:30,180
charts, but broken out by geological province. The green shows the lower

176
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:36,660
48 states, the conventional oil. The orange shows Alaska, which is separated

177
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,340
from the United States by Canada. It's not even a contiguous part of our

178
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,020
country. The blue is offshore oil. It's not on the land. It's underneath the

179
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:53,260
Gulf of Mexico. And this red is what has been fracked, the light tight oil.

180
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,180
The light tight oil depletes at 80% in the first 18 months, and you have to

181
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:04,460
continue to drill to find more. And there's nothing left after the tight

182
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,940
oil. This is the source rock for where all the other oil originated.

183
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,740
And what ends up happening is, I'll go through this really quickly, the gray

184
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:22,460
here shows the decline rate of all the oil wells drilled in the United

185
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,540
States before 2014. The orange shows the decline rate, and it's a little bit

186
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:35,140
steeper for 2014, all the way up to 2019 in the red. And you can see every year

187
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,900
we add more and more wells, and the United States has drilled more wells

188
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,540
than the rest of the world combined, and the decline rate becomes steeper. So

189
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,660
we are having to run faster and faster in place just to stay in place. So what

190
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:56,820
ends up happening is technology, in the case of shale oil, acts as a larger

191
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,540
straw. Largely the same amount of original oil is there, but we're just

192
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,420
getting it out faster and becoming that much closer to the slurping sound,

193
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,940
which we hear at the end of the milkshake. Yes, new technology does

194
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,940
access some resources that we wouldn't have been able to, but largely it just

195
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:20,620
takes things out faster than we would have got without technology. What

196
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,980
about so-called renewable energy? So one of the important concepts of energy

197
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:32,900
blindness is the fact that all energy is not fungible. It's not equal. It's not

198
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:37,340
interchangeable. So here are a few points on renewable energy. First of all,

199
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:44,460
renewable energy isn't. It's a meme. Renewable energy is rebuildable. Oak

200
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,620
tree is renewable. A chicken is renewable. As long as we find an acorn or a male

201
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:55,900
and female chicken to make an egg, they are renewable. Wind turbines, solar

202
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:02,820
panels, etc. are complicated machinery with polysilicon and a global supply

203
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,260
chain. They are no more renewable than a pickup truck. The sun and the wind are

204
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:12,140
renewable, but the devices we use to make them are not. Another point is renewable

205
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,980
energy produces electricity, but only 20% of global energy use at the present

206
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,820
moment is electric. There are lots of things that because of the energy

207
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,940
density don't run on electricity. They could in the future, but only at a much

208
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:30,540
higher cost. And I showed you early the impact of profits and viability from a

209
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:39,380
higher cost. There is also all of our plans for a techno utopia future kind

210
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,460
of wave away the fact that we've been growing, growing, growing our energy every

211
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,500
single year with the exception of recessions for the last 100 years. This

212
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,100
at some point in the near future will change. And what will renewable energy

213
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,260
and other technology do on the downslope of the carbon pulse? Once these 500

214
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:06,020
billion fossil workers start to retire. Also higher full system cost means lower

215
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,060
economic benefits. As I said before, there's a difference between a technology

216
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:17,300
being viable and being affordable and scalable. Also, there are around 6000

217
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,420
other products that are generated from oil and natural gas. And, you know, we

218
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,900
have asphalt and plastic and medicines and tires and all kinds of medical

219
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,300
devices, etc. These all come from oil. So if we stopped using oil, we would need

220
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:40,140
to find alternatives for many of these 6000 inputs that are byproducts of our

221
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,620
current barrel of oil. So far, the energy transition has not been. It's been more

222
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:53,300
of an energy addition. If you look at the last 200 years of human energy use, the

223
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,980
green is biomass, the brown is coal, the black is oil, the dark blue is gas,

224
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:05,020
nuclear, etc. Solar and wind end up being about two and a half percent of final

225
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,540
consumption. They are growing quite rapidly, but in an absolute and they're

226
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,460
growing faster than fossil fuels. But on an absolute basis, globally fossil

227
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,220
fuels are still growing. They've grown 55 percent in the last 15 years. So far,

228
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,900
there has not been a green revolution, only a green addition. And by the way,

229
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:32,300
we are now using more biomass shown in green here than we were in the year 1850,

230
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:38,860
which was before we started using fossil fuels. Lastly, it is true that

231
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:46,460
renewable energy is much more efficient than coal or oil in various processes.

232
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:53,300
However, society doesn't maximize energy use or maximize efficiency. We

233
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:59,580
maximize power, which is energy use per unit time that creates work. This is

234
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,900
called the fourth law of thermodynamics, which is the maximum power principle,

235
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,740
which is we operate in nature at intermediate states between efficiency

236
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,780
and full resource use. And usually that's at an intermediate state. And the

237
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:20,900
implications for this is that this is an average load at three different times

238
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:27,740
during the year. This is what our societal demands require. And this is what

239
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,340
we work during the day and there's a spike and then we go to sleep at night,

240
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,780
but we still have a lot of baseline things that are going. But society

241
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:41,540
cares about creating this graph. And the best thing for that is potential

242
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:45,580
energy that is stored that we can burn at a flick of a switch and meet these

243
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:51,540
demand curves. We can use solar and wind better than we are doing now, but

244
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:56,380
it's going to look like a much different society. Okay, briefly on materials,

245
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:05,500
energy and GDP are 99% correlated globally. Materials and GDP are 100%

246
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,300
correlated. So if you look at the red line here is global GDP. The purple line

247
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,580
is the material footprint, which is a composite of energy and materials. And

248
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,780
you can see they're incredibly tightly linked. We are growing renewable

249
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,900
energy faster than we're growing fossil fuels, which is why the global CO2

250
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:30,340
continues to increase, but increases at a lower rate than energy and GDP, but

251
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,100
they're very tightly linked. The problem is, is as we decarbonize, we're going

252
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:43,380
to have to rematerialize because renewable energy is very copper, metal,

253
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:49,940
rare earth dependent. Another issue is much of these materials like cobalt

254
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,020
and nickel and lithium and copper are found in countries that are in the

255
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:58,820
global south. They are poorer material countries. They already have civil

256
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:03,580
strife and they're going to be experiencing higher wet bulb temperatures

257
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,500
and chaos and uncertainty from a warming climate. This is a real problem for

258
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:16,980
the scaling of the current net zero EV plans. This graph shows the blue lines

259
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,500
are the production of the country of Chile of copper and the red line are the

260
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,980
consumption of energy. In the United States, we used to have 20% ore grade in

261
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:36,860
the 19th century that went down to 2% ore grade and now is two tenths of 1%. So

262
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,700
we have to get more and more rock and overburden to get the same amount of

263
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:47,940
copper. The point here is that even in materials and in every aspect of society,

264
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:52,300
everything we do will become more expensive if we can't reduce the energy

265
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:57,020
consumption of various processes faster than energy prices grow. Okay, what

266
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,980
about technology? How does technology fit into this? Well, every unit of GDP has

267
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,740
three things in common, energy, materials and information or the technology.

268
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:14,220
There are no exceptions. So there are two types of technology. The first type is

269
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:22,180
ways to make energy use more efficient or a new energy technology like a better

270
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:30,500
solar panel. The other type of technology type two is creating devices that replace

271
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:36,540
what humans used to do manually or new inventions that our prior ancestors never

272
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:41,620
had access to. The vast majority of technology in our world today is of this

273
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:47,140
type two, which ends up increasing the baseline for more energy requirement the

274
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:55,780
following year. So this graph shows that humans get better at inventions and we

275
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:02,140
get more efficient in our energy use over time, around 1.2% a year more

276
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,100
efficient over the last 200 years. However, during that same time, this is

277
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:15,220
another color chart showing the energy stack of various energies over the last

278
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,820
200 years. We continue to grow our total energy. In fact, energy efficiency has

279
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:28,820
increased 36% in the last 35 years. But during that time, our energy consumption

280
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:35,380
has increased 63%. This is called the rebound effect or Jevons paradox that as

281
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:40,340
we make more profits because we got more efficient, we funnel those profits back

282
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:46,420
into economic growth, which is a draw on energy. What about money? Money is what

283
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:51,540
makes the world go round, right? Well, money is actually a claim on energy. When

284
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:59,020
you spend your loony at Tim Hortons or any other thing in our daily lives, every

285
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:05,140
time we spend something, it's a call on energy. Economic textbooks tell us that

286
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:11,780
money is lent out from existing capital at banks. This is incorrect. The reality is

287
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:17,140
is that the vast majority of money is lent into existence. Banks don't lend

288
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,020
money. They create it. And when they create it, the financial system is in

289
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:28,020
balance. There's the same amount of assets and liabilities. But the bio

290
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:33,580
physical world is not because when 10 million Canadian dollars come into the

291
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,460
system from a bank, the same amount of timber or moose or copper or dolphins or

292
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:47,340
trees exist. So here's a conceptual showing from time from left to right

293
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:54,300
that we had sustainable flows of the biogeochemical use of nature, the soil,

294
00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:01,300
the sun and the wind. And in around the 1700s, we hit a capacity on that. There's

295
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,580
a different sort of curve, which is a Gaussian or normal curve, which is for

296
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,620
finite resources. And we started to access things like oil and copper and

297
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,620
coal. These were buried underground, but they're finite. And we started to add

298
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,900
them to our economic system. But there will be a peak and a decline of these

299
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:25,540
like their will on the carbon pulse. Overlaid on all that is a monetary thing,

300
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,540
which is a cultural creation by our species that we create monetary markers

301
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,780
for all this stuff. And if you put all these three things together, they create

302
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,220
this little graphic. And with access to these, this ancient sunlight, which is

303
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:45,620
indistinguishable from magic on human time scales, our economic system grew so

304
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,020
fast and large that land no longer explained our wealth. And gradually,

305
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,740
the economics profession parsed our explanations into capital and labor.

306
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:01,300
And using the social construct of credit, which is largely run by central banks

307
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,460
in the world right now, we pulled resource consumption forward in time. Now

308
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:12,020
our world views our future and our culture through a financial lens. We have

309
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,580
not only financialized the human experience, but also the explanation of

310
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:22,580
it. Okay, that's the energy material tech part of the story. Now, what about

311
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:28,100
the environment? What about the pollution that comes from our economic system?

312
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,380
This could be its own two hour talk, but I'll just give the highlights right

313
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:40,140
here. It's not just climate, but there are many aspects that the human system

314
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:47,580
is affecting the natural world. This shows the last 400,000 years of CO2 in

315
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,860
the atmosphere shown in green, global temperatures shown in the middle panel

316
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:58,100
in red, and sea level rise shown in the bottom in blue. We have already had

317
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,580
400 feet of sea level rise in the last 20,000 years, and we are in uncharted

318
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:10,100
territories from any time before the emion. We are now going into a warmer

319
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:15,020
period than at any time when humans lived on this planet. And I could argue

320
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:20,580
that humans are changing climate today, but climate change actually caused

321
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:26,900
humans. The red chart in the bottom is expanded here in the last 20,000 years.

322
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:34,060
Around 15,000 years ago, the climate warmed and stabilized, unbelievably

323
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,580
stable for the last 10,000 years, which is when we expanded around the world

324
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,780
with agriculture and settlements and hierarchy and technology, etc. And now

325
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,140
we're moving out of that stable band into the unknown. The only known is

326
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:53,580
it's barring a nuclear holocaust. It's likely to be warmer to much warmer.

327
00:30:53,780 --> 00:31:00,340
So this carbon pulse that we are living through, yet it's invisible to us, is

328
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:07,060
really distinctly important because many, most of the prior mass and many

329
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:13,820
extinctions were correlated with carbon pulses. The blue spikes here show the

330
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:18,500
percentage of the genus level extinctions on Earth over the last

331
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,780
300 million years. And the magenta bars are when there were large outgassings

332
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:32,220
of volcanic provinces that were near term pulses of carbon. And this ended up

333
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,100
being disastrous for species on the planet. Unlike most mass extinctions

334
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,780
linked to volcanic pulses, our pulse is not from volcanoes, but from Volkswagen's

335
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:50,340
and vacations and deforestation and other things. This is a monthly graph of

336
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,860
the temperature anomaly from the pre-industrial baseline. You can see

337
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:04,700
that many of the hottest divergences are this year, 2024. One could argue that

338
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:08,860
this would be the coolest year of the rest of your lives. I'm not sure that's

339
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:15,220
entirely valid because this is an El Nino year, but you can see that the heat

340
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:21,420
is on. Part of the climate discussion that is not often discussed is the impact

341
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,780
on oceans and there are many, many ocean risks. There's ocean acidification.

342
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:34,380
There is the erosion of coastlines since the sea level is going to rise as the

343
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:41,660
glacier and ice melts. There's overfishing. There is the loss of some calcium

344
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,580
carbonate in shells. There's the impact on food webs. Ocean oxygen content is

345
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:54,820
already declined by 2% and 20% in the shallows. There are many, the AMOC, the

346
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,980
Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, has

347
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,340
slowed already 15%. This is all because the oceans are absorbing 90% of the

348
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,300
heat from the extra thermal warming from fossil fuels. Beyond climate itself

349
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,380
and climate is the key because it affects all the other things I'm talking

350
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,140
about, we neglect our impact on the other 10 million species we share this

351
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:27,620
planet with, what I refer to as the real stock market. Since I was born, we have

352
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:34,340
lost almost 70% of the animal populations on this planet and it's

353
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,460
probably worse than that because that's status is six years old. We don't see

354
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:45,100
that that much in North America because we've only lost 25% here, but in Asia

355
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:51,100
and Latin and South America, it's much more extreme. This chart shows on the

356
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:57,780
left the estimated biomass of wild animals 100,000 years ago relative to

357
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:04,220
the orange of wild animals today, relative to the light pink, which is our

358
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,580
cows, pigs and sheep and humans. So humans in our livestock now outweigh wild

359
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:16,260
mammals at a ratio of 50 to 1. It's not only animals, insects are declining at

360
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:22,260
1 to 2% a year in biomass. This is trillions of tiny robots doing tasks

361
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,300
humans couldn't do without them that we take for granted. Birds eat insects.

362
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:32,380
Birds are also declining. These are Canadian statistics here showing the

363
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:38,260
percentage decline of various types of birds. One thing that's increasingly in

364
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,540
the media is the impact not only of plastics like plastic bottles and the

365
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,500
fact that plastic now outweighs all animals on earth and will eventually

366
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,220
outweigh all the fish in the ocean, but microplastics. There's something called

367
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:59,260
PFAS, which is a forever chemical. We don't, scientists don't really understand

368
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,780
the endocrine disrupting impacts. However, sperm count in humans and in other

369
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,980
animals is declining at an accelerated pace globally. Sperm count is dropping at

370
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:17,580
around 2.5% a year. Right now, one couple in seven cannot have a baby because

371
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:22,660
of lack of sperm motility. And that's shocking. But what's even more shocking

372
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,220
is 20 years ago, it was zero in seven. And there are some estimates by 2050

373
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,300
under current trends that we won't be able to have babies. Okay, that's a

374
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:36,580
pretty rugged little summary I went through there. And it's as many times as I

375
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,700
say it, I still get kind of a pit in my stomach as I'm sharing this with

376
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,340
strangers online, because many of you are aware of those things. But if you

377
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,660
haven't heard those things before, it can feel like a punch to the gut. And I

378
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:55,460
will just empathize with you that that is a normal, totally acceptable reaction.

379
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,020
And if that is your reaction, I offer you a brief apology, but these are the

380
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,340
times we're alive. This is why I'm sharing this stuff, because I think most

381
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:08,060
people, more people need to understand and engage with these issues. Okay, let's

382
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,940
moving on to the core driver of this stuff, which is the human human behavior,

383
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:21,620
starting with our feelings. So we are related to every single other creature

384
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:27,380
on earth. We share a common universal ancestor. If you look on the tree of

385
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:33,100
life, there's humans way down here in the corner. We're 99.9% related to all

386
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,460
other humans, including Canadians, were 98% related to other apes, bonobos and

387
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:44,940
chimpanzees, 90% related to cats, 85% genetically related to mice, 80% to

388
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:51,740
cows, 60% to fruit flies, 60% to chickens, and we are 50% genetically related to

389
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:56,300
mushrooms. We are kin with everything else on this blue green earth. And we

390
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:01,940
often forget that. We go through our life, like other biological organisms,

391
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:08,260
trying to match the same emotional states of our successful ancestors. So

392
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:14,020
bagging a gazelle on the Pleistocene savanna. Today we make a stock trade or

393
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:21,620
make a Bitcoin profit and with the same areas in our brain light up. Humans are

394
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:27,540
intensely social and status conscious. This has to do with the concept of sexual

395
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:34,980
selection in nature, which in the case of a peacock, this giant ornate tail has

396
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:41,260
three fitness hits to the peacock. It is a cost of all its minerals and

397
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,580
calories going to this tail. It makes it more apparent and obvious to a predator

398
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,300
and if a predator chase it, it's harder to get away. All three of those were

399
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,900
overcome by the preference from the female peacock for such a display. And

400
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,060
are we that different than this? This picture here shows Tiger Woods, who's a

401
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:06,740
billionaire, his yacht pulling into a marina where his ex-wife's boyfriend's

402
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:13,220
yacht is 10 feet longer than his. So we constantly compare ourselves to others

403
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:21,300
at various scales, planet wide. We also have neural circuitry that hijacks our

404
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,500
ancestral reward system and tricks us into thinking that the things we're

405
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:32,020
doing are actually good for us and good for our status and our respect in our

406
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:37,860
tribe. For instance, some students may be watching this presentation, might play

407
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:45,380
Overwatch or some video game and their brains feel like they're bagging a

408
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,940
gazelle for their tribe, but they're actually sitting in a couch in their mom's

409
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:55,060
basement accessing a coal-fired server. The dopamine superhighway is really

410
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:59,700
central to planetary overshoot and our consumption because what ends up

411
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:04,580
happening, shown in this graph, there's academic research reference on the

412
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,660
bottom, that we get the signal and the signal causes the behavior and we do

413
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,380
the work and then we get the reward. We don't get the dopamine when the reward

414
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,340
happens, but before it's the anticipation of reward. But what ends up

415
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:25,060
happening in our culture is energy has become so cheap and we have such a

416
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,100
smorgasbord of consumption that our work and our behavior is disconnected from

417
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,020
the reward because we get reward all over the place all the time without doing

418
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,860
the work. So we end up in a situation and this is a picture of my storage shed

419
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:47,220
where the ghost of dopamine past ends up buying things constantly and the

420
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:53,220
wanting of things ends up being a more powerful driver of our behavior than

421
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:57,220
the having of them. All of you go home this weekend and look in your

422
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:02,660
garage, in your storage shed, etc. We got short-term dopamine hits for those

423
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,540
purchases, but they weren't sustainable and we had to buy more to feel the

424
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:13,300
same way at some point in the future. So important point, our brains are flow-based,

425
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:19,380
but our world, our economic system is stock-based and we're driving down the

426
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:25,460
stocks of non-reluable energy and resources millions of times faster than

427
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,500
they were built up in order to get ephemeral dopamine. In effect, we're

428
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,940
turning billions of barrels of ancient sunlight into microliters of neurotransmitters.

429
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:42,100
We also have different belief systems and the human brain can utter millions of times

430
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,460
more sentences than can exist in biophysical reality. So the virtual world in our minds

431
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:56,420
is really more powerful than our biophysical reality and this is why science in the academy

432
00:40:56,900 --> 00:41:04,100
are hopefully can play a vital role in our path going forward because science is

433
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:10,900
a light in the dark and can distinguish fantasy from reality. It's the best tool that we have.

434
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:20,180
We are incredibly in-group and out-group oriented. We quickly and strongly form groups and we defend

435
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,620
and support our group and tend to ostracize and root against others. Groups could be a few people

436
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:31,860
or they could be nation-state size. Shown here is Canada beating the U.S. in hockey.

437
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:41,380
We are very social. We're ultra-social so our behaviors are plastic but we copy other humans

438
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:47,620
and this is good news because cultural evolution happens at lightning speed versus biological

439
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:55,460
evolution. Okay so those are the the primary drivers of the human ecosystem. How do those

440
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,980
fit together? How does the whole system fit together into a narrative that explains our

441
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:07,780
current reality? I'm sure you've seen starlings in nature. Starlings follow three simple rules.

442
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:14,500
Do what your neighbor does. Don't get too close and fly towards the center. Those three simple

443
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:21,460
rules result in this emergent behavior of these beautiful murmurations of birds in the sky that

444
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:27,620
look like they're choreographed but they're not. It's an emergent property. Humans do something

445
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:34,260
similar. In our current world importantly this is not the way that it always was and it's not the

446
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:41,860
way that it has to be in the future but we coordinate in our families, in our small businesses,

447
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:49,940
in our corporations, even as entire nations to acquire financial surplus which is linked to energy.

448
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:56,420
We spend the surplus and we pursue culturally accepted behaviors. The emergent property of that

449
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:06,820
is this vast interconnected material and energy hungry system of human habitation and commerce

450
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:13,300
across the planet. If you look at this, the brake lights and the headlights in this aerial view of a

451
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:20,900
city are not biophysically too dissimilar than the veins in the arteries of a human body and the

452
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,820
hemoglobin that is being passed through these veins and arteries is gasoline and diesel fuel

453
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:33,540
from oil and we have a global transport system. This is the airline routes through the earth.

454
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:40,740
So our culture keeps score of this system by gross domestic product. If you add up all the

455
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:49,620
countries in the world it's gross world product. Well GWP given the 99% correlation between energy

456
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:59,460
and GDP could rightly be named gross world burning because energy and GDP are and will remain tightly

457
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:07,700
linked. So my economic research, my academic research has likened human culture to an energy

458
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:16,500
dissipating structure, a mindless superorganism akin to a blind hungry amoeba. So human society

459
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:23,860
has a metabolism and metabolism has a waste product in the form of CO2 and other things.

460
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:31,940
So the global north has been trying to go to renewable energy, getting rid of coal although

461
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:37,940
we're still using natural gas, but the developing world especially China and India are growing

462
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:45,300
as much energy as they can. So since the 2015 Paris Agreement we actually have a global increase

463
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:51,860
in coal use. China is building six times more new coal plants. India plans to double their coal

464
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:56,740
production. They are aware of climate. India is going to be one of the most susceptible countries

465
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,900
to climate. The reason they're doubling their coal is because it's the cheapest thing that they can

466
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:07,620
do and they need more air conditioning and fans. So trying to mitigate climate change within our

467
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:14,580
existing economic structure is like arguing with a forest fire. This is an uncomfortable conclusion

468
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:21,300
but it's one that I've come to believe. There is no one driving the bus of our economic system,

469
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:29,220
not politicians, not billionaires, not the rich and powerful. The market is pulling us forward

470
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:34,980
and we have outsourced our wisdom and decision making to the financial markets. So this is kind

471
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:42,020
of a metaphor from Lord of the Rings, the Tower of Sauron. I've graphically shown here the history

472
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:49,620
of humans and technology. Shown in the bottom is we left our hunter-gatherer ancestry and started

473
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:56,260
to produce agriculture which created agricultural surplus which we could trade. We had hierarchy

474
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:02,980
then. We had mayors and kings and artisans and warriors and accountants and then a couple hundred

475
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:10,020
years ago we accessed the power in flammable fossils and then we turbocharged this faster by

476
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:16,420
creating fiat currency that were markers for real things and we accelerated the whole thing

477
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:23,620
and now we're using artificial intelligence to make all these processes even faster and this whole

478
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:32,740
thing is this Borg or this Eye of Sauron pulling this economic system forward and it's my opinion

479
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:38,420
and there's ample evidence in the last few months to underpin this is under our current

480
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:45,540
economic aspirations and goals which are of course fluid in our lifetimes. Artificial intelligence

481
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:52,180
is going to much like shale fracking act as a larger draw on the energy in the environment and

482
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:57,940
that doesn't include it doesn't focus only on how much energy the servers are. Today a news story

483
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:03,700
came out that said that just the data servers alone in the United States are going to use as much

484
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:11,700
energy between now and 2030 as 150 million electric vehicles. That's not the point. The point is that

485
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:16,660
AI is going to make energy extraction. It's going to make alternative energy. It's going to make

486
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:23,380
all the processes in our world more efficient potentially and all of that is going to accelerate

487
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:28,260
impact on the environment. Okay we're getting nearer to the conclusions of this part one.

488
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:32,740
Under the framing that I presented here what is not likely to happen?

489
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:37,780
Growing the economy and mitigating climate change and the six mass extinction.

490
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,860
Growing the economy by replacing fossil fuels with renewables we're actually adding.

491
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:51,460
Culture en masse choosing to leave fossil carbon in the ground and governments embracing limits

492
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:57,940
to growth before limits to growth are well past. Under this framing what is likely to happen?

493
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:04,340
A growth in gross energy while net energy declines. Massive money creation and financial

494
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:10,980
market support by central banks and governments. Wider and deeper poverty globally and more inequality.

495
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:17,780
AI is going to accelerate the energy and environmental problems unless we shift our goals.

496
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:25,860
A right word shift in politics because as things get scary and uncertain people tend to get more

497
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:31,540
conservative and want ways things to be the way they used to be in the past. This is happening

498
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:37,780
rapidly in Europe. We're yet to see what's going to happen in North America. A reduction paradoxically

499
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:43,140
in global environmental regulations and under the superorganism framing it's going to be

500
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:49,860
pedal to the metal until we hit some sort of a crisis or hit a wall. Implications and scenarios

501
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:58,420
of all this. So there are generally four scenarios that are discussable. One is a green growth future

502
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:04,500
that we use technology and create more productivity in the world and we become

503
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,220
so profitable and productive that we can use the excess to heal the environment.

504
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:16,900
The second scenario is what I refer to as the Mordor economy which is we are going to continue

505
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:25,460
to grow but more and more of our economic energy and materials will be directed to the energy and

506
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:32,660
mining sector of the economy meaning there will be less available for hospitals and universities

507
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:40,340
and entertainment and travel and things like that because our economy will instead of using

508
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:45,700
five percent of our energy to get the energy materials it'll be 10 percent and 15 percent and

509
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:52,740
18 percent leaving less for discretionary society. I call this the Mordor economy and I would say

510
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:59,620
this is the default. We're also going to need more and more energy and money to mitigate environmental

511
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:08,580
problems like droughts and floods and hurricanes and heat problems etc. Let me explain the trajectory

512
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:16,500
of the Mordor economy using this chart. The red line on the far left is when Reverend Thomas Malthus

513
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:24,740
lived on the planet and he said that the geometric production of humans would outstrip our arithmetic

514
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:31,700
production of food and he was wrong. He was wrong because he didn't know about fossil fuels that were

515
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:38,420
underneath the ground. Fast forward to 1969 and Paul Ehrlich wrote a book called The Population Bomb

516
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:44,820
saying many similar things and he was wrong at least about that at that time because he didn't

517
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:52,740
know about debt that we have increased our debt faster than we've increased our GDP in every single

518
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:59,940
year since 1969 and he didn't know about globalization that we could outsource the production of things

519
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:07,620
to the least cost areas in the world. Fast forward to 2009 the next red line and we had a great financial

520
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:14,420
crisis that was bailed out by the central banks taking over the role of monetary creation from

521
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:21,140
the commercial banks. We had COVID in 2020 again the bazooka of the Federal Reserve and other

522
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:31,220
financial guarantees and what will be the next can to kick. If we grow at 3% a year that means the

523
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:39,540
energy and materials given the stats I said earlier will double every 30 years so if there is a 15

524
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:46,100
year old watching this presentation by the time she is 75 there will not only be a doubling but

525
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:54,500
a quadrupling in the energy and material use of the human economy. Is that possible? Is that desirable?

526
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:58,900
What happens if that happens? What happens if it doesn't happen? These are some of the central

527
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:05,620
questions of our time. So that is the Mordor economy. The third category which is what I've

528
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:11,940
named my podcast in my work is called the great simplification which is we will not continue

529
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:19,540
to grow but we manage a graceful descent. The average person in America uses 100 times more

530
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:25,620
energy than our bodies need in terms of calories. If we went down to 70 or 60 or 50 it wouldn't

531
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:33,060
necessarily be a bad thing. So the great simplification is at some point in coming decades

532
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:39,780
when we remove this ubiquitous credit with a shift to more costly energy and resources

533
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:45,780
and a return to solar inputs and renewables which are viable but more costly in a system wide

534
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:51,220
perspective we will no longer be able to maintain our system of financial claims and one of the

535
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:57,860
next three recessions will be a depression. There is a musical chair element to our current

536
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:03,700
system of claims and I refer to this as a great simplification shown here as one trajectory out

537
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:11,220
for the next 30 years. Lastly there would be the fourth quadrant would be the Mad Max scenario

538
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:18,900
which is that we decline and there is no stability and social contract holding things together and

539
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:24,500
I'm sure you've seen enough movies about that scenario. However in our social discourse the

540
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:30,020
vast majority of people talk about this one scenario and the other three scenarios are really

541
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:37,620
not given that much discourse. I would argue that the true odds are more like the areas of

542
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:45,140
these shapes shown here and I'm advocating that we should consciously try towards a great simplification

543
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:52,740
which is a smaller more local economy that still has the benefits of civilization but different

544
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:59,460
relationships with each other with the natural world and hopefully less pollution to the other

545
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:06,980
species and ecosystems. Between here and there however we have some constraints that are now

546
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:13,300
unavoidable and I want to briefly talk about what I call the four horsemen of the 2020s

547
00:54:14,260 --> 00:54:20,260
which I have recently changed the five horsemen. The first one is a financial bend or break moment.

548
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:26,740
We keep papering over our problems with more credit and central bank largesse. In the past 10

549
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:32,820
years government debt has grown 60 percent to 83 trillion dollars. Corporate debt household debt have

550
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:39,540
also grown. We are in a new era where every few months we're increasing the debt in the United

551
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:46,340
States by a trillion dollars. We're just adding that we're transmuting wealth into income. We have

552
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:53,060
this natural endowment of resources energy and ecosystems and we're creating new claims on that

553
00:54:53,060 --> 00:55:02,180
at an accelerating rate. So we create debt much more faster than GDP but we're stretching this

554
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:09,140
relationship to our underpinning reality and there's going to be a snapback at some point because

555
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:15,220
all these financial claims that we're creating will eventually have to be paid back in energy and

556
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:20,660
materials and ecosystem services. The reason that you don't hear talks like this is there is no

557
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:26,980
credible institution or government body in the world that is specifically planning for an end

558
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,100
to growth because it's a very uncomfortable conversation to have. So in the meantime we're

559
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,540
papering over our problems with more and more credit while the energetic and material basis for

560
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:44,100
our currencies deplete. So we don't think of it this way but when we take on debt as a nation,

561
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:49,940
as a company or as a person, the debt must be paid back with energy but as I said earlier our

562
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:56,660
energy, our high quality energy is starting to flatline and will eventually start to decline

563
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,420
but at the same time we're growing the red line which is our monetary markers.

564
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:09,780
Okay second horseman of the next decade is geopolitics. This is June 7th. There are Russian

565
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:16,180
warships headed to the Caribbean. Russia announced yesterday they're going to be selling weapons to

566
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:23,460
countries that are antagonistic to the West. We are approaching this biophysical shift from a world

567
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:30,500
that focused on money and technology to one that focuses on energy and ecology and a lot of the

568
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:36,900
energy in the world is in countries that aren't necessarily so friendly to us. Around two-thirds

569
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:44,820
of the remaining oil is within 600 miles of Israel. Around half of the world's purchasable oil

570
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:51,700
navigates this strait of Hormuz, this two-mile wide strait between Iran and Saudi Arabia every

571
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:59,860
day. These are things that we take for granted. In the, I would say unlikely, I don't know how

572
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:06,980
unlikely it is, it's certainly possible but we have between the United States and Russia about

573
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:15,060
12,000 nuclear warheads and if there were to be an exchange or a strategic escalation this graph

574
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:20,580
shows the impact on climate. This is one way that the climate would actually cool is if there were

575
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:26,180
enough nuclear weapons sent into the atmosphere that the soot blocked out the sun. This would be

576
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:32,580
the absolute worst Armageddon disaster scenario of all because although the climate would ultimately

577
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:38,820
be cooler it would wipe out most of complex life in the process. This is a crappy thing to say to

578
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:44,740
a bunch of Canadian scientists but this is something that our society has shrugged under the carpet

579
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:49,780
and is a very real risk in our world. People were really worried about it 50, 60 years ago

580
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:59,140
and now it's really not in part of our discourse. Also we have to realize that we have a six

581
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:09,060
continent supply chain, this globally interconnected economy that is just in time products. 80% of our

582
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:14,820
pharmaceutical ingredients are made in China and India for the United States which has 4%

583
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:20,500
of the world's population and 50% of the world's medical prescriptions. We have many many just in

584
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:27,060
time supply chains that some complicated part is made in South Korea and ends up in Toronto

585
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:32,980
three days later that without that part we couldn't do some industrial process so this is something

586
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,580
that we take for granted. Also the social contract I don't know how things are in Canada

587
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:45,620
but things are really starting to get a little uncomfortable in the United States.

588
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:50,180
There is an enormous partisan divide in the media in the United States. Very few people

589
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:56,340
read the same news sources, we have different facts, artificial intelligence is making it

590
00:58:56,340 --> 00:59:02,100
difficult to believe what is true or what is not which is another reason that the academy is vital

591
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:08,660
for coming decades because we trust in scientists is declining but it's still among the highest

592
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:15,460
trust that people have is in science. The fifth horseman which if you live in British Columbia

593
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:22,180
and other places you're already aware of is the ongoing impacts of climate change on our ecosystem.

594
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:27,940
There are droughts, there are floods, there are fires, there are wet bulb temperatures where

595
00:59:27,940 --> 00:59:36,980
people can't survive. The other day in Delhi, India it was 129 degrees in early June.

596
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:43,540
Climate is warming right now and this is going to be a story for the rest of our lives. I promise

597
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:49,460
you that I'm going to leave you with some actionable ideas and directions but I do think

598
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:54,340
it's important to understand the landscape of what we face. Here are some summary points

599
00:59:54,340 --> 01:00:01,700
of the first part of this presentation. Long term growth was not the norm. We are living through a

600
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:10,180
unique exponential period of economic growth for our species. There were several periods in the last

601
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:18,260
2,000 years that lasted for hundreds of years with flat to declining growth. All of our economic

602
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:25,700
rules and explanations of how the world works were created in this little red bubble here

603
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:31,220
and what does that pretend for the future. Cheap abundant fossil energy underpins our

604
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:37,620
societies and our society's expectations. This is a stock that we have culturally treated as a flow.

605
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:45,220
It is principle we're drawing down, not interest. We have completed the proximate drivers of

606
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:50,660
progress and growth with the ultimate drivers. Most people think that politics, technology,

607
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:58,500
and money are what drive our economic systems but they are sitting on top of a large

608
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:08,100
flux of around half a billion fossil worker equivalents and on the living, breathing

609
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:14,660
biosphere of which we're all dependent. We don't pay for the ecosystem services of Mother Earth.

610
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:21,700
As long as growing GDP is our global goal, better technology is going to tend to grow and

611
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:27,620
not shrink CO2 emissions and impact because of the rebound effect and Jeven's paradox.

612
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:35,460
Technology could be really important for future decades but it's going to have to be stuff that

613
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:40,420
is appropriate for our economies and we're going to have to change our economic system

614
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:45,140
if this is no longer going to be the case. In other words, the energy transition which is

615
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:51,220
oft lauded in the press is not really about energy. It's ultimately about how we relate to

616
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:57,060
each other, how we relate to the natural world, our levels of consumption, our change in consciousness,

617
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:02,180
and all that. Yes, energy will also play a role but it's not the driver. Barring a new

618
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:07,460
boost in productivity which is possible. It's kind of on the come. I don't know from artificial

619
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:13,860
intelligence. Growth is likely soon over and when that happens there is a musical chair situation

620
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:19,620
and the first challenge is going to be responding to a financial recalibration. At that moment we

621
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:25,940
should aim for bending which is holding the system together and landing at a lower material

622
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:32,660
throughput scale as opposed to breaking. Breaking would be bad. Rather than choose austerity,

623
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:37,940
governments and central banks will continue to print and monetize debt eventually leading

624
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:45,300
to currency debasement and possibly currency reform. We do not actually face a resource

625
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:52,260
shortage but rather a longage of expectations. As I said earlier, the average American uses

626
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:59,460
100 times more energy than our bodies need. Most of the best things in life are free after basic

627
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:07,060
needs are met. Here's me reading a story to my dog at bedtime with two of my college friends

628
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:13,460
talking about birds and doing bird songs with a bunch of kindergarteners in India

629
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:18,820
and some friends I met. I just got back from India a couple months ago. Another point,

630
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:22,980
we do need renewables and technology but the way they're touted now,

631
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:30,260
the renewables are the right answer to the wrong question. The question is how do we land the

632
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:37,380
plane this century with viable technology that supports ecosystems and a thriving human population?

633
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:44,260
Right now we're just using renewables as kind of an appendage to the global super organism,

634
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:51,220
not as a construction of a new system. There is a biophysical phase shift occurring in global

635
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:58,260
politics, alliances and agreements. This means there's a shift between, as I said earlier,

636
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:03,860
money and technology narratives to energy and material narratives and that is going to change

637
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:09,300
the power structure and the international agreements and the trade and the economic growth

638
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:15,540
in the future. Climate change is not the problem but climate change is one of many

639
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:21,300
symptoms of a much larger dynamic dysfunction which is the ecological concept of overshoot

640
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:27,220
which is a species, in this case ours, has overshot the carrying capacity of the planet

641
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:34,020
given our current population and consumption levels. This is a scene from the movie Don't

642
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:41,220
Look Up which was so spot on that I included it in this presentation. This presentation that I'm

643
01:04:41,220 --> 01:04:48,500
telling you all today cannot be voiced aloud in politics and media because it's too strange,

644
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:53,940
it's too complex, it's too abstract, it's too threatening, there are no easy answers and if

645
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:59,940
senior people verbally share that they agree with this, what are the solutions? It becomes

646
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:05,140
politically dicey and uncomfortable. That doesn't mean we shouldn't discuss it, we have to discuss

647
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:09,940
it behind the scenes to create blueprints, a break glass in case of emergency and other

648
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:19,060
paths forward. Last point here is our current resource tech situation can power a great culture

649
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:26,420
and a meaningful civilization, just not this one, not at this size and scale. The current system uses

650
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:36,180
19 terawatts of power continuously which is 190 billion light bulbs turned on 24-7,

651
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:43,940
that is not sustainable. What do we do to get out of this? I think the only way out is through

652
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:51,780
and here are some thoughts at various scales of what we should do. I no longer talk about solutions,

653
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:58,740
I prefer to talk about responses and there are million possible responses. Each of you sitting

654
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:04,740
in the audience or sitting at your office or at your home, just briefly think about what do you

655
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:10,420
think the solution is? What do you think some of the responses should be to the human predicament

656
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:16,660
that I've just laid out the choreography of? And by the way, I may have some pieces of it wrong

657
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:22,500
and I learn stuff every day and I may be missing some important things, but I think if you squint

658
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:28,980
and look at how the pieces fit together, I think what I've described will roughly hold its shape

659
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:36,340
in the coming decades. So if you think about what would be the responses to what I just described,

660
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:42,900
they are different to different people based on what they care about, where they live,

661
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:50,660
what their value system is. There are a list of solutions for rich or well off people or

662
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:56,580
rich or well off countries. There is a list of solutions for poorer countries and people.

663
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:02,500
There is a list of responses and solutions for other species and other ecosystems.

664
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:09,300
And there's a list of unborn humans of future generations and unborn of other species of the

665
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:16,500
10 million currently species we share the planet with. So there's not one size fit all responses.

666
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:22,500
So keeping that in mind, most people care about themselves. The only thing we might care about

667
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:28,260
more than ourselves is our children. But beyond that, our family, our community, our region,

668
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:34,340
our nation, our world, other species, other generations get exponentially less care and

669
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:40,820
our economic decisions. This is also something that we have to recognize when we talk about responses.

670
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:49,300
So in effect, we are somewhere between the yellow star and the red star. And all of our cultural

671
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:58,900
stories are about the green arrow continuing forward in time. So here is the way that I

672
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:06,260
think about this. There are three distinct timelines for interventions. The red is the

673
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:14,340
time now before the crises arrive that we have to prepare as best as we can as individuals,

674
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:21,620
as universities, as communities, as nations, given the synthesis I've laid out. The yellow

675
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:27,700
is the time where there this financial recalibration happens that could be as soon as three months or

676
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:37,220
15 years. I don't know. But that is when there's going to be a currency bond financial reckoning.

677
01:08:37,940 --> 01:08:43,460
And I think we have to focus in that moment and now in preparing for that moment to bend

678
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:50,660
and not break. And then where do we land this plane metaphorically? What are the sustainable

679
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:59,540
practices that Canadians and humans around the earth should start practicing for the longer term?

680
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,340
Because that's what's going to be more sustainable. So there are people that should be working on all

681
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:11,300
three of these timelines and everyone's preference is different. But it's not just let's do one thing.

682
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:16,100
There are three timelines. And not only are there different timelines, but there are different

683
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:22,660
scales. And I'm going to briefly give a list here of some some categories of response at the global

684
01:09:22,660 --> 01:09:29,620
level, the civil society community level for the academy and universities and for individual humans.

685
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:36,260
So culturally, we have a road closed sign ahead of us. And many of us are starting to

686
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:43,620
see that in the distance that what we're doing is unsustainable. So what is the goal of a talk

687
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:50,180
like this? What is the goal of my podcast and my work? It's to normalize the conversations around

688
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:56,420
these topics. So we get more people involved in discussing them, being pro-social and being creative

689
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:01,860
and rolling up their sleeves and getting engaged. What we're trying to do now is change the initial

690
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:08,900
conditions of the future moments when these events start to ensue. So what we're doing is kind of

691
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:15,620
creating a time capsule to imagine what are the things we're going to be need to be doing in coming

692
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:21,300
decades. So here's some categories to consider. At the global level, first of all, as I mentioned

693
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:28,340
earlier, we are moving from a unipolar world to a multipolar world. And what are the governance

694
01:10:28,340 --> 01:10:34,420
structures and ways of doing things that will allow a peaceful navigation through that period?

695
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:41,220
Another is our incentives. We look at the prices of things, and then we make economic decisions.

696
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:50,900
But everything that our culture aspires to is linked to GDP, monetary surplus, and growth. And

697
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:57,300
if we change our incentives to include nature and human health and well-being and the ecosystem

698
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:03,140
health of the world, that's going to mean different incentives, different prices, and different

699
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:10,340
signals. So one thing that I don't know how viable it is to do right now, but we could add

700
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:18,020
a tax to anything that is an input to our economic system that is non-renewable in nature. Not only

701
01:11:18,020 --> 01:11:26,420
carbon, but copper or fossil water aquifers or lithium or anything like that. If we add a tax to

702
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:34,500
these things, what will happen is our devices will be much more expensive, but we will give

703
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:41,540
signals to consumers to conserve things that are mostly non-renewable. And we will give signals to

704
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:47,220
inventors and innovators about the real cost of depleting things, and they will use these

705
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:55,140
scarcer resources more sparingly. So we will conserve and innovate at a better level. The main

706
01:11:55,220 --> 01:12:01,620
input to renewables is human labor. So if we added a tax and we taxed everything that was

707
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:06,820
non-renewable, we would remove all taxes on individuals and corporations. We would have to

708
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:14,580
have some sort of a regressive help for that would be a regressive tax scheme, but it would

709
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:20,980
favor renewable buildout and other things that weren't dependent on non-renewable inputs.

710
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:26,100
In addition to changing the incentives, we need to change the aspirations. So this graph is from

711
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:32,580
Canadian Voslav Smil, who is at Winnipeg, showing that the energy supply used per capita

712
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:40,900
gives us a massive increase in well-being and a human development index from low levels. But once

713
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:47,540
we're at around 100 gigajoules per capita, any additional increase in energy consumption per

714
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:54,100
capita doesn't give us that much. The United States uses almost three times as much energy per

715
01:12:54,100 --> 01:13:00,420
capita as Italy or Japan, yet we're about the same on the human development index, and we're

716
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:08,980
actually declining in life expectation and other diseases of despair in my nation. So to move beyond

717
01:13:08,980 --> 01:13:18,820
GDP, again, most of the best things in life are free after basic needs are met. If I asked you

718
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:24,500
while watching this presentation, what are your five best memories of your life, most of you would

719
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:30,740
not say that they required a lot of money or energy, but it would be playing cards at a slumber party

720
01:13:30,740 --> 01:13:37,700
with your friends or fishing on Lake of the Woods with your family or time in nature in the beautiful

721
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:43,940
forests in Canada with your dogs or things that don't require a lot of energy and money in our

722
01:13:43,940 --> 01:13:49,860
society. Our individuals recognize this, but our society, because we've outsourced things to the

723
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:58,180
market, do not. We need an icon to represent the future of the 3000-some emojis on our phone. There

724
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:06,420
is no icon to represent the future. My colleague, DJ White and I created this tee with an arrow,

725
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:13,220
just as a suggestion, but we need something to represent the future. Another category is advanced

726
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:17,780
policy. The reason that it's called advance and not policy is the things that we're going to need to

727
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:25,700
do as a governing body in Canada and the US and the world can't be happening at the margin because

728
01:14:25,700 --> 01:14:32,100
they're too politically or socially difficult now. So we need to have something like a council of

729
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:38,900
elders that is building break glass plans or blueprints or in case of emergency do this ahead

730
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:45,220
of time so we know what to do when some of these events come to pass. Like the Bender Break moment,

731
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:51,860
I talked about the rubber band snapping back in the financial system. From the perspective of

732
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:58,260
the carbon pulse, what governance structures best fit after the red star? I don't know the answer to

733
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:05,620
that, but democracy and communism and things like that were designed for small groups of people,

734
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:13,060
not necessarily 8 billion people. This is a conversation for a political scientist to integrate

735
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:20,020
the biophysical story that I'm telling here. We need different technology. Technology is vital,

736
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:26,820
but the technology that we have now is just feeding the hungry ghost of the economic super

737
01:15:26,820 --> 01:15:33,060
organism. As I said earlier, solar panels can power a wonderful civilization, just not this one.

738
01:15:33,620 --> 01:15:38,980
So from the perspective of the carbon pulse, what are the top four human inventions of all time?

739
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:46,340
According to Nate, the bicycle is the most energy efficient invention ever made to get a person from

740
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:52,420
point A to point B using the least amount of energy is a bicycle. The story or playing Dungeons

741
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:58,260
and Dragons or anything that is in the virtual world of our mind, sitting with other humans,

742
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:04,740
the unexpected reward and novelty of listening to other people is free, and it's an amazing

743
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:10,500
invention. Number two is the dog, which really isn't an invention. It's a co-evolution. This is my

744
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:19,380
Golden Retriever Quinn. They give us unlimited oxytocin, serotonin, and some dopamine,

745
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:26,500
and what a wonderful thing. By the way, I could not do this work without having a Golden Retriever

746
01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:31,780
around because it's pretty intense. And the number one invention could be music because we are,

747
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:38,100
can be transformed again with not a lot of energy and materials into a different mental

748
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:47,300
state and emotional state and physical state from music. So Homo sapiens is wise man. So far,

749
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:53,460
we've been much more clever than wise. What sort of technology will be most suited for the downslope

750
01:16:53,460 --> 01:17:01,460
of the carbon pulse? I think something that I would refer to as Goldilocks tech, which is not

751
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:09,300
some fancy drone gadget and not going back to the Stone Age, but something in between that's

752
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:16,820
scalable and affordable and sensible. For instance, instead of lithium mining in Bolivia, we can make

753
01:17:16,820 --> 01:17:22,180
batteries from sodium, which is from salt. It's a simpler material. It's not as powerful,

754
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:30,660
not as great as lithium, but it's a Goldilocks tech. There are many, many such things like that,

755
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:35,700
and I think we should start thinking two or three steps ahead about that sort of technology.

756
01:17:35,700 --> 01:17:42,100
Of course, the market and the superorganism will continue forward and do all kinds of fancy dopamine

757
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:50,180
creating expensive splashes of technology, but we need to at the same time simultaneously be

758
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:55,860
building out these alternative technologies and using them and scaling them in communities around

759
01:17:55,860 --> 01:18:03,940
the world. Globally, we also need to change our culture towards more of a regenerative society,

760
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:11,060
and that means right now we are not only the regeneration that hits the earth and net primary

761
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:17,620
productivity all over the earth, how much plants grow every year. We're taking 40% of that and adding

762
01:18:17,620 --> 01:18:24,420
it to the human system, leaving 60% for the other 10 million species, but in addition to that, we're

763
01:18:24,420 --> 01:18:29,860
taking millions of years of stored productivity and adding it to the system. This is patently

764
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:38,100
unsustainable, and for instance, we need to have global cooling shown on the left is whale poop.

765
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:43,700
Whale poop acts as a carbon sink in the ocean because the phytoplankton bloom and then drop

766
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:50,980
to the bottom and they sequester carbon. Shown here is biochar, a new farming technology that

767
01:18:53,460 --> 01:19:02,420
absorbs carbon into the soil, so we need a whole new culture shift in the way that we think about

768
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:09,300
our economic system. I would offer, especially to the young people watching this, that we have

769
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:17,780
arrived at a species-level conversation where we know GDP is ultimately self-terminating either

770
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:26,020
ecologically or with war on our current path. I offer perhaps we could aspire to a life ethic,

771
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:32,180
and I'll briefly read the components of that. Life existing is preferable to no life existing.

772
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:39,380
More kinds of life existing is preferable to fewer. Vibrant, complex ecosystems are preferable to

773
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:45,940
small, fragmented, brittle ecosystems. Ecosystems with large, complex life are preferable to

774
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:51,860
ecosystems with only microscopic life. Ecosystems supporting conscious minds, which are the

775
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:59,380
virtual worlds of human minds and gorillas and dolphins, etc., are preferable to ecosystems

776
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:05,700
without them. It is preferable to maximize existence, happiness, love, and understanding,

777
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:12,820
and to minimize the suffering of minds in the universe. The future, both near and far, is real

778
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:19,220
in the same sense that now is real, and via causality is determined by what is done now.

779
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:25,060
Things which are preferable by this definition may be considered good. Things which are less

780
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:31,460
preferable may be considered evil. We should maximize good and minimize evil since the universe

781
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:37,540
does not. So it's one of my wishes is to educate and inspire humans, to culturally extend,

782
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:44,340
not narrow our circle of care. This is happening around the world with ecosystem restoration,

783
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:50,260
and there are a lot of humans that are trying to step towards a regenerative culture.

784
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:57,620
That's at the top scale. What about civil society? We need better education, shown here

785
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:08,580
as a civilian land core of young people learning ecological skills and how to sequester carbon

786
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:16,580
and grow food and other things. We are headed for a simplification. We see this road close sign

787
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:22,100
ahead. All many of us feel it. I call it the walking worried, and yet there's still all this

788
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:28,580
entertainment and smorgasbord and Amazon brown truck deliveries and cool vacation junkets and

789
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:33,700
hockey games and all this stuff. In the meantime, so we get distracted. But if you look two or three

790
01:21:33,700 --> 01:21:39,220
steps ahead, all this information, especially if you understand human behavior, you know that

791
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:44,900
en masse as a culture, we're not going to voluntarily tighten our belt, which means we will eventually

792
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:52,100
hit a wall. What can we do to simplify ahead of that time? By simplify, I mean reduce complexity,

793
01:21:52,100 --> 01:22:00,580
reduce energy consumption, and any individual, any town, any country that voluntarily reduces

794
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:09,780
complexity first will be outcompeted by other individuals, towns and nations, which is something

795
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:17,380
called a multipolar trap. But some nations or towns will be forced to do this because maybe

796
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:24,580
there's a natural gas pipeline is shut off to Germany, etc. So there is a short term cost to

797
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:32,260
simplifying, but a long term gain because those people, towns, universities, nations that do this

798
01:22:32,260 --> 01:22:38,260
first, while everything holds together are going to develop new models and new ways of doing things

799
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:46,180
that those that are still the the rabbit running around at the high consumption level won't have

800
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:53,300
time to do it once things change. Supply chains, again, showing this Byzantine structured

801
01:22:54,900 --> 01:23:01,860
Rube Goldberg machine, which is the global supply chain, as things become more sensitive

802
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:07,940
and fragile in the global system, and as energy becomes more expensive, and as credit becomes

803
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:13,540
less available, the world is beginning to going to become a larger place again. So localizing,

804
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:20,900
on shoring, near shoring, regionalizing supply chains, especially for basic goods and important

805
01:23:20,900 --> 01:23:28,500
things is going to be important. Shown here is the red circle. I think Toronto is within that

806
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:34,740
circle. I'm not even sure. And, you know, that would be the real core stuff. And then the blue

807
01:23:34,740 --> 01:23:41,780
circle is, you know, you trade with with other areas. But those areas are much easier to get to

808
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:49,220
than China or India or South Korea, etc. A shadow council, one of my favorite movies was

809
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:54,740
Contact with Jody Foster, and they built a machine that would travel to outer space. But there was

810
01:23:54,740 --> 01:24:00,100
a religious fundamentalist that sabotage the machine, and we thought the movie was over.

811
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:07,700
But lo and behold, they had another machine that they built not telling anyone in Hokkaido, Japan,

812
01:24:07,700 --> 01:24:13,860
and Jody Foster, spoiler alert, ended up traveling to another dimension. In the same way,

813
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:20,820
our city councils and the high status humans at universities as well will be resistant to the

814
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:29,300
information in this presentation for many very valid reasons. So to construct a shadow council,

815
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:34,180
which ostensibly doesn't have the power and the authority as the regular city council,

816
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:38,260
but they can be talking about these things and learning and building social capital and

817
01:24:38,260 --> 01:24:43,940
creating ideas ahead of time. It's something that's working off to the side that's unofficial,

818
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:49,940
but it's still working towards a great simplification. I can't speak to Canada, but the

819
01:24:49,940 --> 01:24:58,420
United States is really bifurcated. We have echo chambers, many, many of them. Here's a list of

820
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:05,460
memetic tribes from left to right politically. There are many different social groups that

821
01:25:05,460 --> 01:25:11,060
really don't talk to each other, and we're going to need diplomats that can suppress their own

822
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,500
political agendas and the things that they care about in order to host discussions

823
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:21,940
with wider groups of humans, because without that, we're really in trouble. So we need to have

824
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:28,980
diplomacy and facilitation with people that don't agree with us. Transmutation,

825
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:36,660
a word from King Midas who everything he touched turned to gold. Everything we've been doing is

826
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:48,100
transmuting the natural world over time into money over time. So while we can change monetary

827
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:54,180
markers into real capital, real capital is natural capital, which is our forests and our

828
01:25:54,180 --> 01:26:00,420
healthy soil and our rivers. Social capital is our friends, our relationships. Here's two of my dogs.

829
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:07,300
That dog shown there, Maisie, is going to be 14 in September, by the way. This is my house,

830
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:12,900
built capital. There's solar panels and chainsaws and an aloe vera plant and human capital, which is

831
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:20,660
our health and our knowledge and our skills. These are real capital, and we should use our

832
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:30,740
monetary markers to turn into more of these things. Healing. We have, most of our population

833
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:37,460
has experienced trauma. Some of you are probably experiencing trauma watching this presentation.

834
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:43,700
We are increasingly an unhealthy society, and in order to address some of the challenges I'm

835
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:49,780
presenting today, I suggest we need in every community across Canada and in the United States

836
01:26:49,780 --> 01:26:57,140
and in the world libraries, but we also need libraries of healing, where we have mental health,

837
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:04,900
buttressing and meditation and exercise and healthy food and dance and community events and

838
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:11,460
social interactions. I spent six weeks in India earlier this year, and I was surrounded with 30

839
01:27:11,460 --> 01:27:17,460
people for six weeks, and we chanted and sang every morning and did calisthenics. Then we had

840
01:27:17,460 --> 01:27:25,300
lectures, and we've become so rich as a culture, on average, that we just live in our own little

841
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:30,900
castles and order stuff online, and we don't need people anymore. But in the near future,

842
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:37,620
we're going to need people again, and we're going to need to have healing of people. I think mental

843
01:27:37,620 --> 01:27:43,540
health, as we approach the Great Simplification, is going to be a huge issue. There are many people

844
01:27:43,540 --> 01:27:51,220
who are qualified, who are watching this show, this presentation right now, in Canada that have

845
01:27:51,220 --> 01:28:00,180
abilities to make this happen. A life brigade, again, this is my appeal to an animist respect

846
01:28:00,180 --> 01:28:09,060
of nature. We need a cultural change, some of us, to say, no, the superorganism is not allowed

847
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:16,660
in this corner of Canada, in this part of my community in Saskatchewan or in Ontario. This

848
01:28:16,660 --> 01:28:23,220
part is sacred, and the economic superorganism is not allowed here. This is not an economic

849
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:30,420
statistical argument. This is an argument from the heart that we treat these things as sacred.

850
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:38,500
As this entire economic system has increased, and now including artificial intelligence,

851
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:46,500
are we in service of power or of life is a central question for the coming decades.

852
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:55,140
Moving to the academy, and again, I have a PhD, but I'm not affiliated with the university now. I

853
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:59,700
used to teach at the University of Minnesota. These are just some suggestions of the importance

854
01:29:00,900 --> 01:29:05,380
that the universities around the world and in Canada can play towards this story.

855
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:12,980
First of all, is we need to realize the context of our lives. So, again, the global human economy

856
01:29:12,980 --> 01:29:19,700
is a thousand times bigger than it was five centuries ago. Most of the science about humans

857
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:25,940
and about human societies, especially social science, was developed during this very anomalous

858
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:32,420
period. I think the academy needs to understand the carbon pulse and the moment that we're at

859
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:40,260
because it informs all of our futures, and so this should be a driving backdrop for all

860
01:29:40,260 --> 01:29:48,260
people at universities is to understand some part of the system's story. So, instead of silos,

861
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:54,820
academic silos, we really need to integrate the disciplines at universities around the world and

862
01:29:54,820 --> 01:30:02,660
have people horizontally doing horizontal and vertical research and sharing and integrating

863
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:08,580
because it's the system science integration that matters. The time of reductionist

864
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:16,180
expertise is over. We still need that, but only as part of a larger narrative.

865
01:30:17,540 --> 01:30:23,060
What does education look like? What are the things that we need to be teaching young people

866
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:31,700
as we approach the nadir of the carbon pulse? What are some of the things we teach at universities

867
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:37,860
that are really trivia and facts and figures that are no longer relevant to the future? What are the

868
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:44,100
things that are going to matter to the young humans that will live during the 21st century?

869
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:53,860
I think it's an incredible opportunity for the privileged academic curious people who are professors

870
01:30:54,580 --> 01:31:02,020
to apply whatever their knowledge is with a passion and intensity that matches the scale

871
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:08,020
and stakes of our time, and so still be scientists, be the best scientists you can be,

872
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:13,700
but also be warriors at the same time because you have a contribution to make. Maybe it's

873
01:31:14,180 --> 01:31:21,620
developing an alternative to PFAS chemistry in our products, or maybe it's a new

874
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:28,260
collective governance system, or maybe it's a regenerative agricultural technology. I mean,

875
01:31:28,260 --> 01:31:34,900
there's vast contributions that the academy can make, but we need to wake up and really rise to

876
01:31:34,900 --> 01:31:41,700
the occasion because the academy has more degrees of freedom than a lot of areas of our culture.

877
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:47,060
I suggest that for those professors that are approaching retirement,

878
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:54,900
that in the last few years before they retire, they do a pro-social capstone that is relevant

879
01:31:54,900 --> 01:32:02,180
to this biophysical story of humans in our future, that is a contribution to the future of humanity

880
01:32:02,180 --> 01:32:09,700
given their domain and their expertise. And lastly, I suggest that many social

881
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:15,940
contracts have occurred in the past. This is 20,000 years ago, the Cave of the Hands in Lascaux,

882
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:27,540
but in my experience, the vibrance and curiosity and revolutionary spirit often happens in cities

883
01:32:27,540 --> 01:32:34,260
that have universities. And it's at a university that the mitochondria of something to replace the

884
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:41,700
superorganism may be born. And as stewards and chaperones of these young humans, I think you,

885
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:50,740
as professors, can breathe life into this new mitochondria. Last but not least, you are professors,

886
01:32:50,740 --> 01:32:57,940
you are citizens, but you're also humans. And I'm going to finish with some recommendations

887
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:03,220
of how to take this all on board in your own life. First category is being. How do you be

888
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:11,220
during this time? First of all, it is totally normal to grieve of the future that we thought

889
01:33:11,220 --> 01:33:18,420
existed, but now you're starting to understand that a different future lies ahead. And if you're

890
01:33:18,420 --> 01:33:24,260
sad about this, it's totally normal. What's not normal is you're dismissive or laughed about this

891
01:33:24,260 --> 01:33:32,100
or felt indifferent. Grieve is appropriate to what we face. So give yourself some time to reflect

892
01:33:32,100 --> 01:33:40,020
on this. And by the way, don't believe me in what I'm saying this. Research for yourself and come

893
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:45,220
to your own conclusions. But even if you think I have a 10% chance of being right in what I've

894
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:52,020
said today, I hope you will integrate some of these ideas into your work. Remember to keep

895
01:33:52,020 --> 01:33:57,860
perspective. If we're alive at the top of the carbon pulse, that seems like a really scary thing.

896
01:33:57,860 --> 01:34:04,980
But what about the Inuits in Nunavut or the Yukon or up in the north of Canada? If you told them,

897
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:10,820
if you told a human, I'm going to set you out on a minus 50 degrees Celsius ice flow,

898
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:15,060
you would think that's a death sentence. But to the people living up there, it's just another

899
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:22,340
normal day. So we have to keep perspective of how much amazing opportunity we have. We have

900
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:28,340
access to all the information ever acquired by our species for free at our fingertips to give

901
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:33,860
one example. Don't forget to live. I forget this a lot because this is stressful toxic stuff that

902
01:34:33,860 --> 01:34:40,580
I've chosen as my job to teach. But we have to live and love and play music and dance and play with

903
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:48,260
baby ducks and go on hikes and take naps and all the things that humans do. And not forget to have

904
01:34:48,260 --> 01:34:55,540
gratitude every day for all the amazing things in this time that we have, these perilous risks,

905
01:34:55,540 --> 01:35:01,940
but there's a lot to be grateful for. And I'm grateful for a lot in my life. We have to remember

906
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:07,380
that this is a marathon and not a sprint and to nourish our own bodies and souls and minds

907
01:35:08,260 --> 01:35:16,820
with healthy food, with exercise, with timeouts. We have to heal our amygdala and our fight or

908
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:24,900
flight response of our reptilian system and pause and reflect and be healthy. I think in addition

909
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:32,180
to Goldilocks tech, inner tech is going to be a necessity, something I will benefit from myself.

910
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:39,700
I need to walk the talk before I really advise this, but we are faced with a smorgasbord of different

911
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:47,620
advice and opportunities and dopamine and consumption and travel. But really our culture

912
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:52,900
has shortened and shortened our attention spans and dopamine has become a predominant

913
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:58,980
neurotransmitter in our behaviors. And especially young people, they increasingly have lower

914
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:04,900
attention spans. They can't read a book. They can only watch short TikTok videos. And my advice,

915
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:11,060
especially to the young humans watching this, is to avoid the shallows and make sure to have dates

916
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:18,180
where you set technology aside, dates and windows and times, because your brain is your most important

917
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:23,300
asset going forward. And you want to have the attention span to be able to plant gardens

918
01:36:23,300 --> 01:36:29,700
and read a book and do longer term projects. So the real asset allocation shift isn't necessarily

919
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:37,300
from money into real capital. It's also from our focus on dopamine into a more healthy portfolio

920
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:44,020
of neurotransmitters like serotonin, endorphins and oxytocin. Doing, what do we do with all this

921
01:36:44,020 --> 01:36:50,100
information? Well, you simplify first and beat the rush. Most of the best things in life are free

922
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:56,020
after basic needs are met. And to simplify, if you really understand that society is not going to do

923
01:36:56,020 --> 01:37:02,260
these things ahead of time, that gives you an interesting impulse on the back end because it

924
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:08,900
empowers you to do things now because you know that society probably won't. And to simplify your own

925
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:18,180
life and don't be reliant on a large house that's going to be a lot of money to heat or cool or a

926
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:24,580
boyfriend in Holland or any, well, if you really want a boyfriend in Holland, I'm not going to

927
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:29,620
gainsay you, but my point is that energy and money are going to become more expensive in the

928
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:36,740
not too distant future. Learn skills. You can imagine what skills are going to be needed in

929
01:37:36,740 --> 01:37:44,740
coming decades. And a lot of us are neglecting physical skills because our culture is so rich

930
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:50,420
that we can outsource the skills to someone else. Ask yourself if half of what I'm saying comes to

931
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:55,380
pass. What is a skill that you could contribute to in your own community that you're kind of good

932
01:37:55,380 --> 01:38:00,740
at and are interested in? Avoid the consensus trance. We are such social creatures that we

933
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:07,860
look to others to confirm what's true and have as academics, you're probably not as prone to this,

934
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:15,540
but avoid group think and what other people think you should do and think what is our reality

935
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:21,380
and come to your own conclusions. Intermittence. Humans don't need baseload energy. We are

936
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:27,940
baseload energy, so we get massive energy benefits from the first few of the 100

937
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:38,100
light bulbs we have invisibly behind us. The first few have sufficiency, and then there's enough,

938
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:42,740
and then there's plenty, and our current cultural goal is more and more and more stuff. So we have

939
01:38:42,740 --> 01:38:48,820
to remember that we don't have a true resource scarcity, but rather a longage of expectations.

940
01:38:48,820 --> 01:38:54,900
Carrying dissonance. Uncertainty is physically uncomfortable for humans, which is why people

941
01:38:55,540 --> 01:39:00,260
tend to gravitate towards really polarized positions, because then they don't have to

942
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:08,660
devote any mental energy towards other what-ifs. So the natural response to a presentation like this,

943
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:13,780
if you haven't studied it, is, oh my gosh, technology will solve it. This is too Malthusian.

944
01:39:13,780 --> 01:39:18,660
We'll figure something out. There's no problem. Or, oh my god, we're screwed. It's Mad Max.

945
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:25,380
But the reality is going to be in the middle, and we have to become more comfortable with

946
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:34,580
uncertainty and navigate the pathways between fantasy and doom. Find the others. This is a

947
01:39:34,580 --> 01:39:38,900
scene from Lord of the Rings, and one of the reasons that I love the book, and many people love

948
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:44,820
the book, is the fellowship. The fact that these nine, they're not even people. They were

949
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:51,380
hobbits and men and dwarves, and they got together and shared an experience. We need to do the same

950
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:57,220
thing. We are on a runaway train where the market and the superorganism is shoveling fuel into the

951
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:03,540
engine car. So we need to meet with others in the dining car and have conversations about what

952
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:10,260
matters and work on things that we're passionate about, and just enjoy life with people and find

953
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:18,260
the others that are on the same moral, intellectual, educational pathway that you are.

954
01:40:19,540 --> 01:40:26,180
Sharpen the sword. We have the agenda of the gene as biological organisms. We are a product of what

955
01:40:26,180 --> 01:40:31,700
worked in the past. We're walking forward, but our eyes are looking backward. But we don't have to

956
01:40:32,340 --> 01:40:37,940
follow the agenda of the gene. It is not our friend. So sharpening the sword is improving

957
01:40:37,940 --> 01:40:44,020
yourself towards a direction that you care about and you're capable of, and sharpen the sword because

958
01:40:44,020 --> 01:40:51,380
the sword is you. We are an intense comparing social species. We compare ourselves to others.

959
01:40:51,380 --> 01:40:57,380
I talked about Tiger Woods and his wife's new boyfriend, but we do this all the time. We flex

960
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:03,140
and do other things just to raise our status. But we have to keep in mind that on an absolute

961
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:09,860
basis, the average person in North America is richer materially than kings and queens of old

962
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:15,700
from an energy and material standpoint. And yet, a lot of us feel like we're failing because we're

963
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:23,300
comparing ourselves to the advertisements on television. So consider the absolute wealth that

964
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:29,460
you have in the access to things that you have instead of comparing yourself all the time to

965
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:38,740
others. Lastly, being, doing, and we, we need to expand the definition of self to be commensurate

966
01:41:38,740 --> 01:41:48,500
with our times. So one pro-social thing we can do is there is a autocorrelation with negative

967
01:41:48,580 --> 01:41:56,420
sentiments and negative emotions and anger and distrust. One person smiling and changing the

968
01:41:56,420 --> 01:42:02,180
behavior can break the chain of this. So don't be afraid to be kind and smile at strangers

969
01:42:02,180 --> 01:42:09,460
and do unexpected behaviors of grace because you never know what sort of chain you're going to

970
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:14,820
disrupt and start a new chain in a new direction. We don't know what's going to happen in the future.

971
01:42:14,820 --> 01:42:21,140
I think this presentation might have put some new walls on the probability distribution of what's

972
01:42:21,140 --> 01:42:26,980
possible. But one suggestion I have is to wend your way towards something that you're passionate

973
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:32,740
about and care about. This is my good friend and colleague, DJ White, who ended up being the co-founder

974
01:42:32,740 --> 01:42:40,660
of Greenpeace International and he ran Earth Trust. This is when he was 22. He was a geologist living

975
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:48,420
in Indiana and he didn't really know much about the world except he loved dolphins and whales.

976
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:52,500
But he determined there were no dolphins and whales in Indiana and he bought a one-way ticket to

977
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:59,220
Hawaii and volunteered cleaning dolphin poop out of aquariums. And within 15 years, he was the

978
01:42:59,220 --> 01:43:06,900
single most effective environmental activist of our time. He stopped the drift nets in the oceans.

979
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:14,900
He did the Flipper dolphin safe tuna at Starkist. He stopped a dolphin drive kill in Taiwan

980
01:43:14,900 --> 01:43:20,740
and many other success stories just because he took a step in a direction without a plan of

981
01:43:20,740 --> 01:43:27,940
something he was passionate about. So I recommend that you wend yourself towards something that

982
01:43:27,940 --> 01:43:34,580
you feel passionate about with a purpose. Towards that end, give yourself a 24-hour vacation from

983
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:39,700
other people and technology in a place you personally find meaningful and ask yourself,

984
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:45,940
who do I wish to be in this life? Why do I wish that? And how might that may be made real?

985
01:43:45,940 --> 01:43:55,060
And the answers are for you alone, but you might be glad to have them. Intrinsic. We often get

986
01:43:55,060 --> 01:44:02,740
validation externally for our behaviors and our self-worth, but given the stakes of everything

987
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:08,660
I've described today, we have to follow our own moral compass of what feels right and what feels

988
01:44:08,660 --> 01:44:15,780
wrong and what feels rewarding and meaningful and follow a true north moral compass according to you,

989
01:44:15,780 --> 01:44:22,340
not according to other people, and be intrinsically motivated. Do something for the benefit of someone

990
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:29,300
else that nobody else, including the person or animal or forest, will ever know. Examine closely

991
01:44:29,300 --> 01:44:35,860
the complex feelings this causes to arise within you as a first step in sorting social motivation

992
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:41,780
from personal altruism, especially for the younger people. Rocks in the river metaphorically,

993
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:48,340
as the water starts rushing in our economic systems, many people who are not grounded are

994
01:44:48,340 --> 01:44:54,980
going to metaphorically tumble downstream. And if you have resources and you are psychologically

995
01:44:55,940 --> 01:45:03,140
sound and have a pro-social outlook, try to ground yourself as a large rock in the river of your

996
01:45:03,140 --> 01:45:08,980
community that other people can rely on. And if enough people do this, we can actually not only

997
01:45:08,980 --> 01:45:15,620
help our community and our university, but we can redirect the flow of the water. Maximize your

998
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:20,820
impact. Once we hear about climate change and all the negative things going on in the biosphere,

999
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:27,140
there's a tendency to try to be perfect and not eat meat and drive electric cars and not travel

1000
01:45:27,140 --> 01:45:32,660
and recycle. And the list gets endless. And I think that all those things are good personal

1001
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:38,260
hygiene at these times. But I would much rather you, especially as universities in a wealthy

1002
01:45:38,260 --> 01:45:44,820
country of Canada, to take this opportunity to maximize your impact on the planet as opposed to

1003
01:45:44,820 --> 01:45:51,460
just being one eighth billionth of a slightly smaller part of a problem. So this is the list

1004
01:45:51,460 --> 01:45:59,060
of advice I have for you. I'll close with this quote from Ilia Priogen, an ecological economist.

1005
01:45:59,060 --> 01:46:06,260
When a system is far from equilibrium, small islands of coherence can shift the entire system.

1006
01:46:06,260 --> 01:46:10,260
Maybe some of those islands of coherence could be universities in Canada

1007
01:46:10,260 --> 01:46:17,460
as a mitochondria of a new cultural social system. Thank you all. So Kira, you

1008
01:46:18,660 --> 01:46:23,540
had no idea what I was going to say. You know my work. I hope this wasn't too much for your

1009
01:46:23,540 --> 01:46:28,980
colleagues in Canada. This is the longest talk I've ever given, but I do think it's important to see

1010
01:46:28,980 --> 01:46:34,100
the bird's eye picture. And we've got some time for some questions if you have any.

1011
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:41,620
I have tons of questions, but I want to respect your time as well. One of the things that really

1012
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:46,740
jumped out on me in this talk and some more recent talks I've heard you give is around this idea of

1013
01:46:46,740 --> 01:46:52,900
libraries of care. And why this is really salient, I think when I'm educating in this space, one of

1014
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:58,180
the hardest things, hardest questions that I hear from students is what's the point? And that breaks

1015
01:46:58,180 --> 01:47:03,620
my heart in a million different directions. What's the point from the sense of like an apathy or a

1016
01:47:03,620 --> 01:47:09,060
system overload where they're witnessing the foreclosure of nature. They're seeing the horsemen

1017
01:47:09,060 --> 01:47:14,980
come in. They are watching war, live streaming war on their phones and they say, what's the point?

1018
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:19,940
Or I can't do anything. Or on the flip side, they'll say something like, what's the point? Technology

1019
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:26,660
will save us. And that is baked into this very short-sighted dopamine reward system that they're

1020
01:47:26,660 --> 01:47:32,340
working within. When you brought up the idea of libraries of care, I immediately thought, well,

1021
01:47:32,340 --> 01:47:39,700
the institution is this incredible library. We have many libraries on campus, but how can we

1022
01:47:39,700 --> 01:47:44,020
nurture a different kind of library? And what would that look like for healing and building

1023
01:47:44,020 --> 01:47:50,900
capacity and resilience that would really support the young people who will be alive much longer

1024
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:57,540
than we will, who will be inheriting the mess we're giving them? I think you kind of answered

1025
01:47:57,540 --> 01:48:03,140
your own question. I mean, we need people organically to step up and say, this is what our

1026
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:10,420
young humans need as part of a university of experience. There needs to be a feeling of community

1027
01:48:10,420 --> 01:48:18,260
that goes beyond competition for grades and getting a resume, but actually involves meditation

1028
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:31,540
and cooking and singing and outdoor group activities. And I think the antidote to apathy

1029
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:38,660
is finding other people in a community, because as I mentioned, I deal with this toxic stuff a

1030
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:47,140
lot. And the thing that supports me and leads me away from apathy is the dozens and now hundreds

1031
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:53,140
and growing to be more than that, people that have my back that I talk to about this and feel

1032
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:58,900
as passionate about it as I do, and we're sharing ideas and working on projects, and we're rolling

1033
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:04,740
up our sleeves. And doing it alone feels like what's the point, but doing it in a small group

1034
01:49:04,740 --> 01:49:11,140
as Margaret Mead said, it's small groups of humans are the only thing that can change the

1035
01:49:11,140 --> 01:49:21,460
planet. Or something she said, I forgot the exact words. But I think we need to heal our

1036
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:31,220
reptilian and emotional systems as a precursor to the intellectual thing, because our cognitive

1037
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:40,900
brain that perceives facts and studies for tests sits atop a much larger pyramid of things going on

1038
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:46,980
that in our modern age, we're not that healthy or regulated, we're constantly in a

1039
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:55,860
fight or flight mode and our amygdalas are activated. And so universities need to, I think,

1040
01:49:55,860 --> 01:50:04,820
and communities have to have places to go that aren't scarlet letters, stigma for people that

1041
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:09,940
have, oh, they went to the mental health clinic. It's not like that. It's actually, this is where

1042
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:16,020
I go to be human. It should be promoted. And I want to go there and be with these other humans,

1043
01:50:16,020 --> 01:50:20,340
because we're talking about all this stuff, and we're doing cool things and activities,

1044
01:50:20,340 --> 01:50:27,300
and we need to exercise and good food. And I don't know the university structure, the way it is now,

1045
01:50:27,300 --> 01:50:31,860
how to go from here to there. But something like that is sorely needed.

1046
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:40,100
Hmm. Another thing that comes to mind is how can we widen our boundaries for imaginaries and

1047
01:50:40,100 --> 01:50:46,100
possibilities? We're working in these silos, literally the climate control, everything is

1048
01:50:46,100 --> 01:50:52,420
within these boxes. Do you have any ideas as an educator, as a communicator? Do you think getting

1049
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:58,180
people outside, maybe outdoors? Is there anything you can think of that might be helpful there?

1050
01:50:58,980 --> 01:51:04,020
Well, first of all, ask what would nature do? Spend as much time in nature as you can.

1051
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:12,980
It calms your nervous system. It grounds you. And living in Canada, you have plenty of access

1052
01:51:12,980 --> 01:51:20,260
to that that some people in the world don't. I think we need tangible examples. We need more

1053
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:28,180
examples and pilots of people doing cool, interesting things. There's research shown that

1054
01:51:28,180 --> 01:51:34,420
if someone sees another person doing an act of altruism, they're 300% more likely to do

1055
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:40,020
an altruistic thing themselves. So I think the problem with many of these lectures and these

1056
01:51:40,020 --> 01:51:45,620
concepts is they're all a bunch of scary facts. And then another to-do list of what to do in

1057
01:51:45,620 --> 01:51:53,220
your own life without tangible examples. But the people listening to this, we need to start doing

1058
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:59,380
those tangible examples and promoting them and showing that life doesn't have to be a disaster

1059
01:51:59,380 --> 01:52:07,860
if we're using less energy and less stuff. And so I think just start by doing more things with

1060
01:52:07,860 --> 01:52:16,660
other people in the direction of a simplification. Very cool. And a question for Nate Hagins as a

1061
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:22,100
human, not a communicator and an educator. But you know, I always like to ask you, what are the

1062
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:26,340
coolest birds you've seen lately? And also, what is growing in your garden right now?

1063
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:35,620
Well, I see a lot of birds. And as you know, I think I told you I have the Merlin

1064
01:52:36,180 --> 01:52:43,380
Cornell thing on my phone that identifies them. And yesterday and the day before, I identified a

1065
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:49,540
black-billed cuckoo, which you can look it up. I've never seen one, but I hear it now,

1066
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:53,700
two days in a row, and I'm trying to see it. And I looked it up online. And sure enough,

1067
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:58,340
that is the sound that I'm hearing. I see pilliated woodpeckers every day.

1068
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:05,540
I will give you an honest answer about my garden. My girlfriend is growing a lot of things, garlic,

1069
01:53:05,620 --> 01:53:15,060
and tomatoes, and onions, and spinach, and kale. I'm responsible for potatoes. And the potato

1070
01:53:15,780 --> 01:53:20,260
patch looks like the Tasmanian devil went through there, because I've been so freaking busy that

1071
01:53:20,260 --> 01:53:25,780
the weeds are larger than the potato plants. So I will be frequenting my farmer's market this fall.

1072
01:53:27,540 --> 01:53:31,700
But it is a failing of mine that I've been working too much this spring,

1073
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:41,220
because not only is the produce itself yummy and rewarding in the fall, but it's the act of being

1074
01:53:41,220 --> 01:53:51,700
out in the soil with my birds, my chickens, and ducks, and guinea fowl, and dogs. So my garden

1075
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:57,460
is not as it should be this year, Kira, but I endeavor to change that in the future.

1076
01:53:58,340 --> 01:53:59,860
Through a great simplification.

1077
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:09,380
Well, it's a challenge, right? Because I know this is coming, and I'm trying to affect it with our

1078
01:54:09,380 --> 01:54:16,420
work of our channel and our communication. And in doing that, I've complexified my own life at

1079
01:54:16,420 --> 01:54:21,940
a same time that I know a simplification is coming. And I'm sure many people can relate to that.

1080
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:27,380
But I have grown a wonderful garden in past years, so I at least have the skills.

1081
01:54:28,660 --> 01:54:34,900
And I can still cook this stuff. But to be totally blunt and honest, we were just talking about this

1082
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:41,060
last week. Red Wing, Minnesota, where I live, has a huge farmer's market. And in September,

1083
01:54:41,940 --> 01:54:49,700
in between traveling, I'm going to go there and support the local CSAs and put away our V8 and

1084
01:54:49,780 --> 01:54:55,380
our tomato sauce and our pumpkins and squash and the root cellar and things like that.

1085
01:54:56,260 --> 01:55:03,940
Amazing. Nate, it has been an honor, a pleasure, and I am super grateful for your time on behalf

1086
01:55:03,940 --> 01:55:09,220
of the Environmental Studies Association of Canada and our partners. Thank you very much.

1087
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:15,780
Nothing but amazing things to say about your work. Thank you also to the people behind the scenes,

1088
01:55:15,780 --> 01:55:21,380
to Leslie, to Luke, and to Misty, everyone who's contributed today. Deep thanks from Canada. We

1089
01:55:21,380 --> 01:55:26,740
are very grateful. Good day, my friend. Merci beaucoup.
