WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
We don't change. We don't choose to change, but we sure are changed. And we have to make use

00:07.600 --> 00:12.480
of our knowledge about how that change comes about, because if we don't think the change happens,

00:12.480 --> 00:20.960
we're totally screwed. It is an honor to introduce my next guest, Professor Robert Sapulski,

00:21.600 --> 00:27.600
who at Stanford University is a professor of biology, neurology, and neurosurgery,

00:27.680 --> 00:34.480
as well as a research associate at the Institute of Primary Research at the National Museum of Kenya.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.920
Over the past 30 years, Professor Sapulski has divided his time between the lab,

00:40.480 --> 00:46.080
where he studies how stress hormones can damage the brain, as well as in East Africa,

00:46.080 --> 00:50.960
where he studies the impact of chronic stress on the health of baboons.

00:51.600 --> 01:00.560
Robert is the author of numerous books, of which I have all of them, including his new book

01:00.560 --> 01:09.520
out in October called Determined, A Science of Life Without Free Will. This was a wide-ranging,

01:09.520 --> 01:17.440
intense, and challenging conversation, one of my favorite ever. Robert has had a big influence

01:17.440 --> 01:22.720
on my thinking these last 20 years, and it was a real treat to talk to him in person,

01:22.720 --> 01:28.400
even though when I scheduled the interview, I didn't know his next book was on free will.

01:30.160 --> 01:37.920
I'm still making my mind up on what I think on this topic, but this guy has been working on

01:37.920 --> 01:45.520
this for 40 years, and this is an amazing conversation with insight into the constraints

01:45.520 --> 02:01.440
that biology poses for the great simplification. Please welcome Professor Robert Sapulski.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.480
Professor Sapulski, welcome to the program.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.280
Well, thanks for having me here.

02:12.800 --> 02:18.960
I know you well enough to call you Robert, but I've learned so much from you over the last

02:18.960 --> 02:22.560
couple decades that I feel Professor Sapulski is more appropriate.

02:23.120 --> 02:32.240
Well, all that does is make me feel elderly and having a large prostate, so Robert's just fine.

02:32.240 --> 02:40.800
Okay, Robert, it is. You have a new book coming out called Determined, A Science of Life Without

02:40.800 --> 02:49.120
Free Will, and we're going to get to that, but it is very hard for me as someone who has all of

02:49.120 --> 02:56.080
your books, has watched almost all of your online biology lectures to pass over your decades of

02:56.080 --> 03:01.920
scholarship on the human brain and behavior that's relevant to the subject of this podcast,

03:01.920 --> 03:08.480
which is the great simplification. I know you watched my movie earlier, so let's start with

03:08.480 --> 03:16.000
this, though. How and when did you first realize that you wanted to be a biologist and study animals

03:16.000 --> 03:24.080
and behavior? I was about eight years old when I decided I wanted to be a primatologist,

03:24.800 --> 03:32.480
go study primates in the wild. I've run across a lot of field work people over the years,

03:33.200 --> 03:39.040
not surprisingly, and about two-thirds of them grew up someplace exotic.

03:40.160 --> 03:48.160
Their parents were field researchers or missionaries or some governmental NGO thing in some exotic

03:48.160 --> 03:56.080
place, and then the remaining third would be people who grew up in some god-awful urban,

03:58.240 --> 04:04.400
I'm trying not to use hellhole, but in some ways, yes, and then at some point they stumbled into

04:04.400 --> 04:10.240
the Natural History Museum and imprinted on something, and that was my version of it,

04:10.240 --> 04:16.720
the American Museum of Natural History, and in retrospect, I probably could just as easily have

04:17.280 --> 04:24.880
imprinted on geckos or horseshoe crabs if I had taken a left or instead of a right in the hallway,

04:24.880 --> 04:32.080
but I wound up in the primate exhibit and that's it. I decided I wanted to go live with

04:32.960 --> 04:42.960
primates, non-human ones, forever after. You wrote a primate's memoir and why zebras don't

04:42.960 --> 04:48.960
get ulcers, but recently for a long time you've been at Stanford. When's the last time you've

04:48.960 --> 04:56.560
been to Africa and do you miss that type of work? Let's see, the rhythm I maintained was

04:56.560 --> 05:02.640
nine months a year in a laboratory being a neurobiologist with a lab coat, and during the

05:02.640 --> 05:09.440
summer's three months a year back out in a tent with baboons in the Serengeti, I managed to keep

05:09.440 --> 05:19.520
that going for 33 summers until 13, 12 years ago when things just fell apart there on a whole

05:19.520 --> 05:27.920
bunch of fronts and it was time to pack it in and decide 33 was pretty damn lucky. Yeah, I miss it.

05:28.640 --> 05:36.160
Yeah, I've been to Africa four times, including Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Botswana, Zambia, and I

05:36.720 --> 05:41.840
was enthralled every single time and I wish I could have in a different lifetime

05:43.040 --> 05:53.600
done something like you did. So we are getting into the brain and behavior. Humanity and the

05:53.600 --> 06:01.440
biosphere are facing multiple interconnected challenges. In my own writing and speaking,

06:01.440 --> 06:07.680
I point out and have for 20 years that we don't so much have an environmental problem

06:07.680 --> 06:15.040
or an economic problem, but rather that most of our challenges emanate from a mismatch of the human

06:15.040 --> 06:23.440
brain, modern human brain from our ancestral environment. What do you think about that broadly?

06:24.400 --> 06:32.480
I love your emphasis on that and your work. I mean, it's a obligatory cliche in my field to

06:32.480 --> 06:39.440
like once every 10 minutes start a sentence by saying, well, realizing that for 99% of human

06:39.440 --> 06:45.680
history was spent in small hunter-gatherer bands, it's a total cliche because it's true and it's

06:45.840 --> 06:54.640
incredibly important. Not only are microwaves like a relatively recent invention that don't

06:54.640 --> 07:03.120
particularly fit with our evolutionary past, but agriculture isn't either. Living in sedentary,

07:03.120 --> 07:10.400
settled communities isn't either. All of that is in a blink of an eye. The notion that culture

07:10.400 --> 07:20.160
evolves faster than brains do is at the core exactly of a huge amount of what ails humans.

07:20.960 --> 07:26.720
So historically, culturally, it's been common to think of our emotions, our psyche,

07:27.360 --> 07:34.800
and human personalities as completely separate from the body and physiology. Back 30, 40 years ago,

07:34.800 --> 07:41.520
there was the standard social science model, but a lot of emerging work in the past decades,

07:41.520 --> 07:48.240
including yours, has suggested that that's not true and that these two things are in fact deeply

07:48.240 --> 07:54.800
intertwined. Where did this separation come about in the first place?

07:56.160 --> 08:01.920
Well, you know, everybody has to pull out Descartes at this point who was going on about how

08:01.920 --> 08:08.400
animals are machines and humans have souls and that sort of set up the basic dichotomy

08:08.400 --> 08:16.240
that people have run with ever since between humans and other species or between the brain and the

08:16.240 --> 08:23.040
body or between the brain and the mind. And what everybody's very fond of saying now is Descartes

08:23.040 --> 08:29.520
was totally wrong, which is animals have emotions and empathy and all of that also.

08:29.520 --> 08:36.800
My take is Descartes was totally wrong because, yeah, animals are biological machines and so

08:36.800 --> 08:44.000
are we. We're just really much more complicated versions, but we're built out of the same stuff.

08:44.800 --> 08:53.600
And where the mismatches become most interesting is when we're working with the exact same blueprint

08:54.400 --> 08:59.200
and the brain and the hormones, all of that of any other species out that were just like them,

08:59.200 --> 09:06.160
that were just like them. And then we go use it in a way that like no orangutan could ever dream of.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.000
And there you have the mismatch.

09:11.520 --> 09:17.520
It's so bizarre having a conversation with you. I just realized something as you were speaking

09:17.600 --> 09:24.400
that in reading your latest book determined when I'm reading, your voice is in my head

09:24.400 --> 09:30.000
reading the words like your voice and your diction. And I didn't realize it till just now,

09:30.000 --> 09:34.960
but it's interesting because I've listened to so many of your lectures. I wonder if that's true

09:34.960 --> 09:44.080
for a lot of people. So building on your point in our culture, in our polarized social media

09:44.080 --> 09:51.600
addicted soundbite culture on the conservative side, a lot of humans don't actually believe in

09:51.600 --> 09:58.800
evolution. And on the more liberal side, anything that is explained as having biological origins

09:58.800 --> 10:05.680
or biological explanations can now get you canceled. What do you think about that? And

10:05.680 --> 10:12.240
will it ever be possible for a plurality or a majority of society to have a broad

10:12.240 --> 10:15.600
understanding of the biological origins of human behaviors?

10:16.400 --> 10:23.920
Well, just to be pessimistic, I think there's always going to be a divide. And it's often going

10:23.920 --> 10:33.760
to be able to be framed in terms of a conservative versus a progressive orientation or a made excited

10:33.760 --> 10:40.240
by novelty versus made anxious by novelty sort of dichotomy. Amid that though, there's like

10:40.240 --> 10:50.400
interesting stuff like a standard progressive stance is to have apoplexy when people start

10:50.400 --> 10:58.000
talking about biological roots, genetic roots, genetic inevitability of something like intelligence.

10:58.640 --> 11:06.640
And obviously, all sorts of right wing ideologues have run with the pseudoscience of like genetic

11:06.640 --> 11:12.800
determinism of IQ, things like that. So that's exactly the dichotomy you've set up there. On the

11:12.800 --> 11:23.840
other hand, when it comes to sexual orientation, the left has been pioneering in the notion that

11:23.840 --> 11:31.360
like being gay is not a choice, let alone a choice that soils your extensive soul or whatever.

11:31.360 --> 11:36.320
It's a biological trait on a continuum. While in this case, it's the right that says there's no

11:36.320 --> 11:44.000
biology there at all. So it's a little bit a function of what the topic is. But all of that is

11:44.000 --> 11:51.920
within, yes, indeed, this very narrow edge that one has to walk on these days between

11:52.720 --> 12:07.920
being canceled and going in a left position that places a humane ideology way above scientific

12:07.920 --> 12:13.040
facts now and then, and then all the folks who want to burn science textbooks.

12:13.680 --> 12:17.920
So do you find it teaching at one of the premier universities in the world

12:18.160 --> 12:26.080
more difficult today than it was 10 or 15 years ago to discuss the biological origins of many

12:26.080 --> 12:36.640
human behaviors? Yes, maybe a little bit. Every other year, I teach this big class. It's been

12:36.640 --> 12:42.960
getting like five, 600 students per round in sort of the last decade or so about the biological

12:43.040 --> 12:49.520
roots of human behavior, human social behavior. And I always say for the next to last lecture,

12:49.520 --> 12:58.240
one of the biological roots of religiosity. And like I realized after a while that I didn't record

12:58.240 --> 13:06.080
it because it came back and bit me in the rear in some ways. And inevitably, you know, my theme

13:06.080 --> 13:13.760
and it was, you know, religious belief or the lack of capacity for religious belief or biological

13:13.760 --> 13:18.800
phenomena, just like anything else. And they're interesting to analyze and they've got all sorts

13:18.800 --> 13:24.480
of unexpected twists and it's complicated as hell or all that. But we're biological organisms.

13:25.120 --> 13:34.240
And inevitably, there's always some religious students who are offended. Very nicely inevitably,

13:34.240 --> 13:42.240
there's always some religious students who instead have an epiphany. And usually earlier in the

13:42.240 --> 13:49.200
quarter come to me and say, oh, my God, I'm like kind of having a crisis here. And I say, me too,

13:49.200 --> 13:55.360
that's what that's what I had as well. At least they're not hostile. No one's condemning me to

13:56.560 --> 14:03.840
Hades. What I've noticed is the pattern instead is a few weeks later when they graduate, they

14:03.840 --> 14:08.800
leave me a little gift, which is always like a little pocket Bible saying, please, please,

14:08.800 --> 14:14.400
please read this. I'm really concerned for you. So if that's my version of getting in trouble,

14:14.400 --> 14:20.480
that's okay by me. It's education at this level is kind of like selling insurance. You have to

14:20.480 --> 14:28.000
make 100 calls to get 10 meetings to have one sale and changing minds about the state of the

14:28.000 --> 14:34.960
world is difficult. On that note, I also taught for nine years a class called Reality 101. I'm

14:34.960 --> 14:43.760
just curious, you've been teaching what 40 years now almost, do you have people from your classes

14:43.760 --> 14:50.480
20, 30 years ago that reach out to you and say this was a foundational epiphany for me and it

14:50.480 --> 14:58.240
changed my life and my worldview? I imagine you do. You know, I'd love to hear that every day,

14:58.240 --> 15:04.560
but more than more often than I've had any reasonable expectation of that sort. But

15:05.760 --> 15:10.960
yeah, and it's it's very pleasurable. It's nice. It's nice to see my ex students who are like

15:10.960 --> 15:16.960
chairs of psychiatry or this or that at med school. It's like even more nice to see

15:17.920 --> 15:24.080
someone who's using a biological model now in the social work they've been doing for the last 25

15:24.080 --> 15:32.080
years. I've got two ex students who are senators now and one of them I take complete credit for

15:32.080 --> 15:39.520
and the other I run from in a panic. So that counts as a net zero there and I won't use names, but

15:40.320 --> 15:46.960
you know, education is kind of a cool thing. My father was a professor architectural history

15:47.600 --> 15:53.920
in New York City and at his death sort of we went through the number crunching to figure out

15:53.920 --> 15:59.680
14% of New York City's licensed architects had been in a class of his at some point

16:00.320 --> 16:05.440
and that felt really damn good to see. So that's cultural evolution?

16:05.680 --> 16:15.920
Yeah. And in a very exciting way, you know, students have learned all sorts of stuff about

16:15.920 --> 16:21.040
stress hormones from me. I've learned all sorts of interesting vocalizations from baboons.

16:22.640 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, culture rolls along and it involves acquiring new behavioral characteristics.

16:30.960 --> 16:37.520
So let's get into this. This is a difficult interview for me to have because if we weren't

16:37.520 --> 16:42.480
time or energy constrained, it would probably go on for five or six hours because there's

16:42.480 --> 16:48.320
so much to cover in your work that's relevant to the coming decades of humanity. So let's do

16:48.320 --> 16:56.720
just a real quick flash round on three hormones that seem prominent in your research on the brain

16:56.720 --> 17:02.240
and behavior. Dopamine, serotonin, sorry, well, you could include serotonin, dopamine,

17:02.240 --> 17:08.400
testosterone and oxytocin. So could you briefly maybe tell a little story about what are the

17:08.400 --> 17:14.800
common misconceptions of these neurotransmitter slash hormones and what roles do they actually

17:16.080 --> 17:17.840
play in shaping our behavior?

17:18.560 --> 17:24.000
Great. And you're absolutely right to say the slash because it used to be testosterone

17:24.000 --> 17:29.440
only belong to the endocrinologists, but then it's due in something neurotransmitter is in the

17:29.440 --> 17:34.800
brain and dopamine used to only belong to the neurocanus. So yeah, it's on a continuum, of course.

17:35.600 --> 17:40.000
Testosterone, everybody knows exactly what testosterone is about, which is the hormone

17:40.000 --> 17:45.920
that makes you aggressive. It explains why males the world over in species after species are such

17:45.920 --> 17:52.240
pains in the asses because testosterone causes aggression. Testosterone does not cause aggression.

17:52.240 --> 17:59.120
What testosterone does mostly is it amplifies, it increases the volume

17:59.120 --> 18:03.680
on the aggression that's already there, the aggression that's been socially learned.

18:04.560 --> 18:12.400
And that's a very different story. A perfect example of it, you take five male monkeys,

18:12.400 --> 18:18.160
they've formed a dominance hierarchy, number one, trashes two through five, two trashes three

18:18.160 --> 18:23.280
through five, all of that. So you take number three in the hierarchy and shoot them up with

18:23.280 --> 18:29.440
testosterone, shoot them up with like so much of it, like he's growing out or something.

18:29.440 --> 18:35.520
And does he get in more fights? Absolutely. Whoa, testosterone causes aggression.

18:35.520 --> 18:40.560
But what you might speculate at that point is as a result of that testosterone,

18:40.560 --> 18:47.200
number three is suddenly like confronting numbers two and one and maybe toppling the

18:47.200 --> 18:53.280
nah, you never see that. He still is just as brown nosing with them as he used to be.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.600
All that happens is he's become a total nightmare to numbers four and five.

18:58.640 --> 19:04.080
All the testosterone has done is amplify the social learning that was there already.

19:04.080 --> 19:09.680
One and two, you have to pretend you like they're like haircuts. Four and five, you can do anything

19:09.680 --> 19:15.760
you want to. So let's do it 10 times as much as normal. Testosterone doesn't cause aggression.

19:15.760 --> 19:22.880
Testosterone amplifies what's already been socially learned. And testosterone even more so

19:24.080 --> 19:31.360
is about defending challenges to your status. But then humans have come up all sorts of

19:31.360 --> 19:37.600
circumstances where defending your status does not involve aggression. Just look at a bunch of

19:37.600 --> 19:45.120
rich half-drunk people at a charity auction and they're competing for status over who could

19:45.120 --> 19:50.400
give away the most money conspicuously. That one doesn't make a whole lot of sense when

19:50.400 --> 19:57.680
testosterone is all about aggression. And in studies where people get status by being more

19:57.680 --> 20:04.400
generous, you give people testosterone and they become more generous. It's not about making you

20:04.400 --> 20:10.480
aggressive. It's a making about amplifying whatever you've learned is good for holding on to status

20:10.480 --> 20:17.520
in your little sliver of the universe. That's fascinating. I didn't know that. And how we get

20:17.520 --> 20:23.520
status in our culture is probably going to have to change away from conspicuous consumption,

20:23.520 --> 20:30.400
et cetera. So testosterone will play a role. Exactly. And I mean, what that tells us at the

20:30.400 --> 20:35.600
end of the day with like human aggression, testosterone isn't the problem. The problem

20:35.600 --> 20:43.920
is that we hand out so damn much social status for aggression. That's the thing that needs to be

20:43.920 --> 20:50.640
solved. And as you know, that's immediately intertwined with who's got how many toys and how

20:50.640 --> 20:58.080
conspicuously can you display it, et cetera, et cetera. We may not be economically rational,

20:58.080 --> 21:04.720
but we are economically competitive and testosterone just feeds into that in ways no other

21:04.800 --> 21:15.600
ape can make sense of. And what about dopamine? Dopamine, totally great, exciting neurotransmitter.

21:16.240 --> 21:21.920
Another one where everybody knows what dopamine is about, which is dopamine is about reward.

21:21.920 --> 21:29.840
It's about pleasure. Cocaine works on the dopamine system, various euphorians. You like give somebody

21:29.840 --> 21:35.360
cocaine and they're releasing a thousandfold more dopamine than like some key parts of the

21:35.360 --> 21:41.920
brain ever do. And whoa, it's amazing. Dopamine is about reward. It's about pleasure. And

21:41.920 --> 21:48.800
superficially, it seems that way. You take a person or a monkey or a rat and you give them a

21:48.800 --> 21:54.400
reward from completely out of nowhere and they have a rush of dopamine. Yeah, that's great.

21:55.200 --> 22:00.720
Then you look more closely. And what you do is you take a paradigm and it works this way in a

22:00.720 --> 22:06.880
human or a monkey or a rat. You like train the individual that, okay, we put you in a room and

22:06.880 --> 22:13.280
as soon as the little light comes on, it means every time you press this lever 10 times, you're

22:13.280 --> 22:22.000
going to get a little reward. Signal work reward, signal work reward. So the organism learns that

22:22.560 --> 22:29.520
the college freshman in psych 101 or the lab or whatever, and they learn this. So you put them

22:29.520 --> 22:35.120
in the situation, the light comes on, they do the work and they get the reward. When did dopamine

22:35.120 --> 22:42.960
rise? And if dopamine is just about reward, it rises after you get the reward. That's not what

22:42.960 --> 22:50.960
you see. It rises when the little light comes on. What's that about? That's you sitting there saying,

22:50.960 --> 22:56.400
yeah, I'm all over this. I know about this lever pressing stuff. This is going to be great. I'm

22:56.400 --> 23:02.960
like completely master of the universe at this lever pressing. Dopamine isn't about reward as

23:02.960 --> 23:09.680
much as it's about the anticipation of reward. And we sure know endless ways in life in which the

23:09.680 --> 23:15.760
anticipation turned out to be better than the actual thing. And most importantly, if you block

23:15.760 --> 23:21.440
dopamine from being released at that time, you don't get the lever pressing. It's about the

23:21.440 --> 23:27.840
anticipation and it's about the motivation and the goal directed behavior that's generated by that

23:27.840 --> 23:35.120
anticipation. And our entire economic system is turning billions of barrels of ancient sunlight

23:35.120 --> 23:42.640
into micro leaders of dopamine in anticipating what is better than the actual result of consuming

23:42.640 --> 23:49.040
all these non-renewable natural resources. So it really is at part of the core of our current

23:49.840 --> 23:54.240
superorganism, energy, hungry dynamic of human society.

23:54.960 --> 23:59.440
Absolutely. And a weird human specific feature of the dopamine system

24:00.000 --> 24:06.480
explains, you know, if you want to be grandiose, 99% of what's going wrong with this, which is

24:06.480 --> 24:13.040
like you're a baboon. What are your sources of pleasure in life? You get to hassle somebody

24:13.040 --> 24:18.640
lower ranking than you. You get to have sex. You're hungry and you eat something good. That's

24:18.640 --> 24:25.040
about it. Like if you're human, all of those things feel good, but also like solving

24:25.040 --> 24:34.400
Fermat's last theorem feels good. And like reading about, you know, acts of random kindness on the

24:34.400 --> 24:40.720
and seeing an arousing scene in a movie involving characters who aren't even real and listening

24:40.720 --> 24:48.240
to a symphony and smelling a flower in early and spring to all of that. We've got a system

24:48.240 --> 24:56.720
that has to incorporate responding to rewarding things that range from like remembering a line

24:56.720 --> 25:04.320
of poetry to quadruple orgasms. And the only way you can get a dopamine system that could handle

25:04.320 --> 25:12.800
that large of a range is it's got to reset quickly. It's got to habituate quickly. It's

25:12.800 --> 25:19.520
got to be able to go from okay, we're now going from the good to bad poetry range. We're now going

25:19.520 --> 25:25.680
to the good or bad outcome of a billion dollar lottery and my one ticket range. It's got to

25:25.680 --> 25:33.040
reset frequently. And there's some totally cool research showing some weirdo wiring things about

25:33.040 --> 25:38.720
the human dopamine system that's very unique that probably explains the rapid resetting.

25:39.440 --> 25:45.280
So that's great, but it sets you off for exactly the problem you've spent all your time thinking

25:45.280 --> 25:53.440
about, which is if the dopamine system quickly resets by definition, whatever was an amazing

25:53.440 --> 26:00.240
reward that came out from nowhere yesterday is going to be what you feel like you're entitled to

26:00.240 --> 26:09.280
today and is going to feel insufficient tomorrow. And that's your whole world of like what has gone

26:09.280 --> 26:17.440
wrong. We inevitably habituate to unexpected good stuff. And before you know it, not only is it like

26:17.440 --> 26:24.560
the norm, it's not enough anymore. We get hungry again. Can that can that be trained? I don't

26:24.560 --> 26:31.840
know you very well. So I don't know your own social media and internet habits. But being a

26:31.840 --> 26:40.560
professor of neuroscience and being a dopamine expert, have you created a firewall in your own

26:40.560 --> 26:49.760
behaviors so that your dopamine can, you know, your superhighway can reset to normal things

26:49.760 --> 26:54.240
like flowers in the spring or playing with your dog or going for a walk in the forest?

26:54.240 --> 27:04.000
Or what do you do about that? Well, I try a little bit of a Luddite. So I think I'm protected from

27:04.640 --> 27:11.840
an awful lot of that pumbling. And I think it's sufficiently large and upper generations away

27:11.840 --> 27:16.960
from where the culture is at that like not only don't I know how to access that stuff, but it

27:16.960 --> 27:24.400
probably isn't going to do dopamine things to me that it does for 18 year olds. But in retrospect,

27:24.400 --> 27:31.680
in some ways, that's what spending three months a year alone in a tent in the Serengeti would do.

27:32.800 --> 27:38.480
The nearest electric outlet was like 90 miles away. Mail would be dropped off once every two weeks.

27:39.440 --> 27:46.320
We got water from a river. There was no electricity, all of that. And, you know,

27:46.320 --> 27:52.720
you do that and, you know, baboons are interesting. But I think what kept me spending

27:53.360 --> 27:59.600
now 50% of my life going there back and forth is like at the end of the day,

28:00.560 --> 28:07.520
you are so damn tired from the physical work and from the bright sun and from the cool things that

28:07.520 --> 28:14.320
you saw. And whatever rice and beans you're eating for dinner, you cannot believe how good it tastes.

28:14.320 --> 28:22.960
And it's hot as hell midday, but there was a breeze and you're like euphoric. That's the resetting.

28:23.440 --> 28:30.240
And of course, what I would find is, you know, back in this world, that would have wonderfully

28:30.240 --> 28:35.840
protective residual effects for about six and a half days. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting.

28:36.640 --> 28:43.040
I'm trying to do this Silent Saturdays thing now, just because as the podcast gets more popular,

28:43.040 --> 28:48.720
I have so many emails and social media and stuff and it's becoming becoming a little much. So I'm

28:48.720 --> 28:55.840
trying to ratchet down my baseline a little bit and just do mundane things on Saturday

28:55.920 --> 28:59.680
with limited success so far, because I don't have free will, but we're going to get to that.

29:02.000 --> 29:09.360
So and oxytocin, what about oxytocin? Okay, oxytocin, it's the grooviest hormone on earth.

29:09.360 --> 29:19.120
Oxytocin is about love and trust and social intelligence and all of that. Oxytocin is

29:19.120 --> 29:25.200
this amazing hormone, best evidence is it's about 100 million years old. And what it first evolved

29:25.200 --> 29:30.000
for was like the most basic thing that mammals were getting around to doing, which was making

29:30.000 --> 29:35.760
mothers get attached to their kids and kids attached to their mothers, which is really essential

29:35.760 --> 29:41.120
if you're going to do that mammal dependent on mom stuff. So that's been around for about 100

29:41.120 --> 29:48.000
million years. Best evidence is about 30, 20 million years ago, it then got, you know,

29:48.000 --> 29:56.560
refigured and started being used as well for pair bonding, you know, monogamy. And it's just a

29:56.560 --> 30:03.200
tiny percentage of social mammals that are monogamous, but they make heavy use of oxytocin.

30:03.200 --> 30:09.440
And whether we are one of those species is a really interesting topic in and of itself because

30:10.000 --> 30:16.080
we're not, but we're kind of a little bit and we're very confused. And then I don't know,

30:16.080 --> 30:22.800
maybe in the last five million years, oxytocin then got reconfigured again for things like

30:22.800 --> 30:29.680
trust and social cooperation and generosity and game theory settings and all that.

30:29.680 --> 30:35.760
Here's the naughtiest thing we've done with oxytocin, this 100 million year old hormone.

30:35.760 --> 30:43.520
And in the last 20,000 years, we've reconfigured it again so that we secrete it and our dogs

30:43.520 --> 30:51.600
secrete it when we're looking into each other's eyes. Like, whoa, we're now using oxytocin for

30:51.600 --> 30:57.760
feeling attached to our ex wolves, like 20,000 years, a blink of an eye and now we use it for that

30:57.760 --> 31:03.520
and you give a dog oxytocin and it looks at its human longer. Okay, so everything about oxytocin

31:03.520 --> 31:08.640
there is great. And if we could just dump oxytocin in the water supply, this would be a wonderful

31:08.720 --> 31:18.320
planet. Oxytocin promotes prosociality, it doesn't. Oxytocin promotes prosociality with people who

31:18.320 --> 31:26.240
you consider to be an us, people like me. And your pet dog who you spend more on for food each

31:26.240 --> 31:32.800
year than your Sudanese gets in a decade counts as an us. What does oxytocin do when you're

31:32.800 --> 31:40.080
encountering thems? It makes you crappier to them. It makes you more preemptively aggressive.

31:40.080 --> 31:46.400
It makes you less trustworthy. Oxytocin doesn't make you nice. It makes you nice to people who

31:46.400 --> 31:53.440
already count as a you and it makes you awful to them. It just takes this us them like fracture

31:53.440 --> 31:59.680
line we have in our heads and it just pushes it apart further. And amazing studies showing you

31:59.680 --> 32:04.080
give people oxytocin and they become more cooperative to their team members and they

32:04.080 --> 32:10.560
become awful to the people on the other team. It is not this groovy hormone. It is this hormone

32:10.560 --> 32:18.640
that makes parochial, you know, provinciality more dramatic and that's not often a good thing.

32:19.280 --> 32:26.960
It's just so obvious to me how critical biology and where these neurotransmitters originated

32:27.600 --> 32:35.200
and why and what they're doing to our behaviors and our culture are so relevant to what we face.

32:38.000 --> 32:42.400
What do you know about how oxytocin or anything else can change

32:44.080 --> 32:48.800
the dynamic or who is us and who is them? How does that change?

32:49.520 --> 32:57.200
Well, what it's really ideal for is what a lot of these hormones that expect

32:58.960 --> 33:04.080
affect social behavior are good for. Yeah, you get someone who's super aggressive and testosterone

33:04.080 --> 33:09.440
makes them more aggressive. You get someone who's incredibly altruistic and prosocial and oxytocin

33:09.440 --> 33:14.800
probably makes them more so. Who you want to get are the folks in the middle when they're looking

33:14.800 --> 33:22.000
at an ambiguous stimulus. Is this face angry, threatening or what? And most people would say

33:22.000 --> 33:28.000
looks neutral to me and give someone testosterone and they now perceive it as being threatening.

33:28.000 --> 33:34.400
Take a neutral face and give somebody oxytocin and they're now more likely to look at as friendly

33:34.400 --> 33:41.600
or trustworthy. Where these hormones do their most modulatory things is the gray zone where what

33:41.600 --> 33:48.560
you're perceiving really is much more in the eye of the beholder than the external realities of your

33:48.560 --> 33:56.000
perceptions. It's really good at influencing interpretations in the gray zone. And that's

33:58.320 --> 34:04.720
once again, it doesn't really require a hormone to have hated Nazis even more than you hated them

34:04.720 --> 34:12.320
before. But depending on which politician is spouting which stuff, a hormone that turns a

34:12.320 --> 34:18.880
neutral ambiguous signal into a strongly felt one for good or bad, that's where you really

34:18.880 --> 34:25.520
see the interesting consequences. It's so fascinating. So I want to get to your new book.

34:26.320 --> 34:33.600
But one of my staff members is a fan of your work and she wanted me to ask something related to

34:33.600 --> 34:40.320
one of your books, why zebras don't get ulcers, you talked about stress. And for an individual

34:40.320 --> 34:47.920
making a decision now, the effects of stress in the last few months of their life will, if I

34:47.920 --> 34:53.600
understand it correctly, shrink the prefrontal cortex and enlarge the amygdala affecting whatever

34:53.600 --> 35:00.640
decision that that individual will make. So following the logic of the great simplification

35:00.640 --> 35:07.600
that we're approaching the peak of the carbon pulse and we're going to have less energy to power

35:07.600 --> 35:13.840
society, if individuals who are barely having their basic needs met stressed out in terms of

35:13.840 --> 35:20.640
survival, are those individuals less likely then to be pro-social and more prone towards

35:20.640 --> 35:26.240
violence and effect in a society with less access to resources and lower standard of living?

35:26.960 --> 35:32.000
Does that itself change the brains of its citizens immersed in that, causing

35:32.640 --> 35:38.560
a negative feedbacks and less trust, etc? Yep, absolutely. And in all the bad ways,

35:39.520 --> 35:46.640
you especially, you might imagine, it's not just in the previous few months, it's already,

35:47.200 --> 35:51.680
you look at this, this is one of these findings where you should be up and screaming at how the

35:51.680 --> 35:57.200
world works this way. You use some totally fancy brain imaging techniques that you could use on a

35:57.200 --> 36:05.680
fetus. And by a third trimester fetus, their mother's socioeconomic status is already affecting

36:05.680 --> 36:10.880
their brain development by way of the mother's stress hormones. So it was not just in the last

36:10.880 --> 36:16.080
few months, it's starting from when you were still like mostly being fed by mom's blood and her

36:16.080 --> 36:24.240
stress hormones. So in that regard, it's an entire lifetime worth of good or bad luck that is sculpting

36:24.240 --> 36:31.280
your brain into a more reactive this or a sluggish that and all of that absolutely plays out.

36:32.720 --> 36:38.640
In terms of your specific question of a world of more and more deprivation,

36:39.200 --> 36:51.280
hunger, fear, stress, uncertainty, all of that, temperature, ambient temperature. In cities,

36:51.280 --> 36:57.520
the ambient temperature on a particular day is a statistically significant predictor of levels

36:57.520 --> 37:04.000
of violence. As this planet gets hotter, cities are going to be more violent. You look at people,

37:04.000 --> 37:09.920
not where they live now, but where they grew up. And you look at people who grew up in cities versus

37:09.920 --> 37:15.840
rural areas and their structural differences in their brain on the average. Whoa, is this

37:15.840 --> 37:21.040
pertinent to our everyday lives? Absolutely. And I think we're three and a half years into seeing

37:21.040 --> 37:26.800
one of the most tragic versions of it, which is for about a week or so into COVID. Everyone said,

37:26.800 --> 37:34.240
wow, we're all in this together. And that lasted about a week. And all it has done is polarized

37:34.240 --> 37:40.080
people and bring out the worst in an awful lot of people while bringing out the best in some people,

37:40.960 --> 37:48.000
but exaggerating us them contrasts and making empathy totally tunnel visioned. And

37:49.440 --> 37:55.280
that's been awful seeing that for the last three and a half years. And just to be really pessimistic,

37:55.280 --> 37:59.760
oh my God, there's this new virus that suddenly is the most important thing in the world.

38:00.640 --> 38:07.760
We blew it with our response to that. That's a pretty unappealing trial run for what the

38:07.760 --> 38:12.640
equivalent's going to be when our cities are flooding and there's not enough crops being

38:12.640 --> 38:22.240
grown anymore. Yeah, this was not a good dress rehearsal. Yeah, I hear you on that. So if it

38:22.240 --> 38:30.800
were possible and fundable, and there was political will, if we truly cared about the

38:30.800 --> 38:38.000
society of the future and what Palo Alto and San Francisco might look like in 2050 or any city

38:38.000 --> 38:49.040
in the world, wouldn't it make sense to invest in third trimester security and oxytocin with groups

38:49.040 --> 38:55.760
of happy people surrounding pregnant women so that they don't have stress? I don't know how

38:55.760 --> 39:01.520
feasible it is, but would it pay dividends over decades if such a thing were pursued?

39:03.360 --> 39:10.640
Actually, multiple lifetimes, which brings in this. Okay, so how did your brain construct

39:10.640 --> 39:15.600
genes had something to do with it, but environment beginning and fuel life has something to do with?

39:15.600 --> 39:21.920
What does that actually mean on a nuts and bolts level? Environmental stimuli starting from where

39:21.920 --> 39:27.840
you were fetus to what you had for breakfast this morning will change which genes in your brain

39:27.840 --> 39:34.080
are active and which are turned off. And in some cases, we'll turn some of them on permanently

39:34.080 --> 39:39.920
and some of them off permanently. And then there's these amazing mechanisms, something that's called

39:39.920 --> 39:46.560
non Mendelian inheritance of traits that because of something in the world you developed in,

39:47.920 --> 39:52.960
you have a body with a certain physiological profile such that when you are pregnant,

39:54.240 --> 39:59.680
you will pass on some of those traits to your fetus, not through genes, but because of the

39:59.680 --> 40:05.040
hormonal environment that's been generated, things like that, where it will affect your

40:05.040 --> 40:10.720
parenting style in a way that will produce a kid who as an adult will be just like you.

40:10.720 --> 40:17.600
Some of these things are multi-generational. Now, amid that, you've got this like

40:18.800 --> 40:28.160
narrow line to the sort of tread there, which an awful lot of like social progressives have to do,

40:28.160 --> 40:37.920
which is, wow, adversity, societal adversity, social adversity, all of that is so, so bad for you

40:37.920 --> 40:44.000
that could actually have multi-generational consequences. Wow, that's really bad. That's

40:44.000 --> 40:49.360
really bad. But where the temptation then is to say, and these are such strong effects, there's

40:49.360 --> 40:56.320
nothing we could do about it. The other side of it is there's very little of that biology

40:56.320 --> 41:02.160
that winds up being written in stone. Interventions at every point in life

41:02.160 --> 41:08.640
can undo some of those things. It's this whole like trendy sexy field called neuroplasticity.

41:08.640 --> 41:15.760
You make the environments of 90-year-olds more sensorially stimulating and at postmortem,

41:15.760 --> 41:22.560
they were making neuronal connections in the park. So, wow, bad stuff leaves long,

41:22.560 --> 41:28.800
long scar tissue, but it's reversible. How do you reconcile these two that seemingly

41:28.800 --> 41:34.880
are contradictory? Yeah, bad stuff leaves consequences for a long time afterward,

41:34.880 --> 41:41.680
and the longer you wait to try to reverse it, to try to counter it, the more of an uphill

41:41.680 --> 41:48.240
battle it's going to be. You want to fix somebody who has been mired in the neurodevelopmental

41:48.240 --> 41:53.840
consequences of poverty. Do something about it when they're four years old, not when they're

41:53.840 --> 41:59.440
applying to college. Thank you for all that. Let's move on to your new book, Determined,

41:59.440 --> 42:05.600
A Science of Life Without Free Will, which is, as I looked this morning, is available for pre-order

42:05.600 --> 42:13.440
on Amazon and elsewhere. Can you give an overview of the main thesis and maybe in there, please

42:13.440 --> 42:21.200
start by defining what you mean by free will. Okay. I published this book about five years ago

42:21.200 --> 42:27.920
called Behave, The Biology of Humans at Their Best and Worst, and it was like the original

42:27.920 --> 42:34.240
draft was a thousand pages, and my publisher had a panic attack, and it was eventually merely an

42:34.240 --> 42:39.840
impossible 700 pages. It was, how do you understand where social behavior comes from? Yeah, it was

42:39.840 --> 42:47.520
caused by neurons one second ago, but it was also caused by whatever environmental stimuli in the

42:47.520 --> 42:52.960
previous minute made those neurons do that, and it was also caused by your hormone levels this

42:52.960 --> 42:58.640
morning that made this or that part of the brain more or less sensitive to these stimuli, and it

42:58.640 --> 43:04.320
has to do with trauma or stimulation in the last year, and it's got to do with adolescence and

43:04.400 --> 43:11.520
fetal life, and your genes interacting with all of that, and what's most like charming to me. It

43:11.520 --> 43:18.640
also has something to do with what kind of culture your ancestors invented 400 years ago, because

43:18.640 --> 43:24.880
that's going to have affected how your mother was mothering you within minutes of birth, cultural

43:24.880 --> 43:32.640
differences with that, and thereafter. So everything from like, was there a good or bad smell in the

43:32.640 --> 43:41.360
room just now, affects people's opinions about social politics to where your ancestors dealing

43:41.360 --> 43:47.440
with a high infectious disease load, and thus they were spooked by foreigners coming in, and that

43:47.440 --> 43:52.800
influences cultural differences and xenophobia today. All of that stuff matters, so you know,

43:52.800 --> 43:57.440
I'd stand up in front of like a bunch of people and go on about this for 60 minutes, and at the

43:57.440 --> 44:04.560
end, the ones who were like still standing, inevitably someone would say, whoa, you know,

44:04.560 --> 44:13.040
this seems to kind of challenge the notion of free will, and like my immediate response was,

44:13.840 --> 44:19.280
yeah, you think, you know, I haven't believed in free will since I was 13 or so, but it was

44:19.280 --> 44:26.640
a little bit of a revelation of, okay, I got to like do son of that previous book and make

44:26.640 --> 44:33.840
explicit, when you put all these pieces together, there is no room for free will whatsoever, we are

44:33.840 --> 44:40.080
nothing more or less than the biology, which brought us to this moment over which we had no

44:40.080 --> 44:46.000
control, and its interactions with environment that brought us to this moment, which over which we

44:46.000 --> 44:53.600
had no control. So the first half of the book is like trying to, in a less screechy way, like

44:53.600 --> 45:00.640
convince somebody of that, and basically go after all of the contemporary compatibilist

45:00.640 --> 45:05.840
arguments where you don't have to deal with like a medium of peasant, you can deal with someone

45:05.840 --> 45:11.200
contemporary who says, yeah, atoms exist, and molecules exist, and neurons are for real, but

45:11.200 --> 45:18.240
here is somehow how you still pull free will out of the rabbit's hat there of like taking on the

45:18.240 --> 45:24.800
contemporary arguments for free will. The second half of the book is the one that's been much more

45:24.800 --> 45:32.080
challenging to me since I was 13, which is, okay, okay, you convince me there's no free will, I give

45:32.080 --> 45:40.560
up, okay. Oh my God, what if people actually started believing this? How are we supposed to

45:40.560 --> 45:47.920
function? What's the world supposed to look like if we all accepted that there's no free will at all,

45:47.920 --> 45:55.360
and what the second half of the book is about is like trying to wrestle with that, and the themes

45:55.360 --> 46:00.880
over and over and there are number one, the roof isn't going to cave in, we're not going to have

46:00.880 --> 46:06.640
like murderers running throughout the streets, because over and over we've been able to deal with

46:06.640 --> 46:13.680
subtracting responsibility out of our understanding of where behavior comes from, and not only doesn't

46:13.680 --> 46:19.760
the world run amuck at that point, it's become a more humane place. Wow, witches really don't

46:19.760 --> 46:26.720
cause hailstorms, so that is one point. Another is this sort of knee jerk responsive, oh my God,

46:26.720 --> 46:32.160
if it's deterministic world and there's no free will, does that mean nothing can change? No, it means

46:32.160 --> 46:39.600
this is exactly how we change. Here's the biology of how you turn Nazis into ex-Nazis 40 years later

46:39.600 --> 46:47.840
who were remorseful, all of that, and I guess the third final theme in there is if you look at this

46:47.840 --> 46:55.520
and this is depressing as hell, oh my God, maybe my corner office and my corporation

46:55.520 --> 47:00.960
and my sense of self-esteem that I've gotten from that wasn't earned because there's no free will

47:00.960 --> 47:06.960
or whatever, what a bummer, maybe this leaves a big existential void, if that's your response to

47:06.960 --> 47:14.160
there being no free will, you're one of the lucky ones. For most humans on earth, their experience

47:14.160 --> 47:20.560
isn't being given credit for stuff that they really aren't worthy worthy of being credited for,

47:20.560 --> 47:26.480
for most humans it's being blamed for stuff that was out of your control, and a world in which

47:26.480 --> 47:33.040
people stop believing in free will is going to be a hell of a lot more humane. I have a lot of

47:33.120 --> 47:43.120
questions, Robert. I sent a note around to my inner circle about a week ago in anticipation

47:43.120 --> 47:49.840
and preparation for this interview, and the response on this topic was very polarizing. There

47:49.840 --> 47:55.840
were some people who thought there were three responses in three groups. One group was like,

47:55.840 --> 48:01.280
it doesn't matter, a book is, we've been having this discussion of free will for centuries,

48:01.280 --> 48:05.680
a book isn't going to change that. There was another camp that said this is horribly dangerous

48:05.680 --> 48:12.160
because it could lead to nihilism at a time when we need a pro-social response from more people.

48:13.360 --> 48:17.280
And then another camp, which was actually the majority, including my girlfriend,

48:17.920 --> 48:24.800
they felt liberated by it because it got them off the hook of things that had been bothering them

48:24.800 --> 48:30.240
and their content in their own lives, so it made them, this is what I'm good at, this is what I'm

48:30.240 --> 48:37.600
doing. So it was really fascinating, three categories of response, and these are largely

48:37.600 --> 48:44.800
intellectual, well-read people that I shared it with. But before I ask you further questions,

48:44.800 --> 48:53.120
could you just define what you mean by free will? Is it a binary thing, yes or no, or is it a spectrum

48:53.120 --> 49:01.360
or a continuum? Yeah, and this part of the debate itself, and apropos of that, and you're

49:01.360 --> 49:07.520
canvassing people, it's interesting that you didn't get, in fact, the most common response,

49:07.520 --> 49:11.840
including people who think about this a lot, including people who make a profession think

49:11.840 --> 49:16.160
about this a lot, saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, this is how the brain works, this is how genes work,

49:16.160 --> 49:23.520
this is how, but somehow, I still believe in free will and it's still there, which is very

49:23.520 --> 49:29.760
different from your people who said, oh my god, nihilism, the people who say, well, even if there

49:29.760 --> 49:34.560
isn't free will, we probably shouldn't tell people that because things are going to go crazy after

49:34.560 --> 49:41.120
that. Most people somehow are, the term is, compatibilists, they're able to believe in

49:41.120 --> 49:47.760
things like 21st century technology and science and stuff, but somehow, there's still a way of

49:47.760 --> 49:52.960
getting free will out of there, and that's 90 to 95% of contemporary philosophers.

49:55.040 --> 49:59.840
It's almost like a religion then, like, I'm not going to die, climate change isn't going to be

49:59.840 --> 50:05.280
a disaster because the truth is so painful that you don't, it's like cognitive dissonance of sorts.

50:05.280 --> 50:13.040
Yeah, and of course, the most interesting ones are these super smart philosophers who go on

50:13.040 --> 50:18.400
and on in books that I can't understand about how, yes, yes, yes, I'm willing to admit, I believe

50:18.400 --> 50:24.400
this is a physical universe, but here's where we get free will from, and when you really, really

50:24.400 --> 50:29.680
look at what they're saying, and when you look at their like YouTube lectures and you look at

50:29.680 --> 50:35.600
where their faces get sort of wincy and pain-looking and stuff, most of the time what they're saying

50:35.600 --> 50:40.720
is, please, let's pretend there's free will, because damn, this is going to be scary if there

50:40.720 --> 50:49.040
isn't, which puts you, you know, one of those circles of your friends. Okay, so what do I

50:49.040 --> 50:56.640
mean by free will? People who get gummed up with free will stuff in the legal realm, it's always

50:56.640 --> 51:03.840
stuff like, did you know you had options to behave differently? Were you aware of what the

51:03.840 --> 51:09.440
consequences would be of the option you did choose? That's all the stuff about intent,

51:11.520 --> 51:17.200
and that's completely boring to me. Then there's a whole school of people neurobiologists who

51:17.200 --> 51:23.200
think about free will, and what they say is something that's sort of like the cousin of,

51:23.280 --> 51:30.720
like the legal approach, which is when you first become aware that you intend to do something,

51:31.760 --> 51:38.400
is it possible to show that your brain already decided to do that? Is the awareness, is your

51:38.400 --> 51:44.400
sense of intent just a total red herring? And in fact, your brain decided before you think

51:44.400 --> 51:49.600
you're decided, whoa, there's no free will. And this was from some landmark experiments in the

51:49.600 --> 51:56.880
1980s, and people have been fighting about the interpretation of that ever since. And, you know,

51:56.880 --> 52:04.880
it's not clear, and it totally bores me also, because both the legal realm and the, ooh,

52:06.800 --> 52:13.280
when do you become aware of intent? And is that different from when you become aware of being

52:13.280 --> 52:18.240
aware of intent? And here we're going to fight that for the next 10 years between the neuroscientists

52:18.320 --> 52:24.320
and the philosophers. None of those people and none of the legal people ask, where did that

52:24.320 --> 52:31.520
intent come from in the first place? And that's where things fall apart, because the intent came

52:31.520 --> 52:35.680
from what those neurons were doing a second ago, and what the hormones were doing this morning,

52:35.680 --> 52:41.280
and what your fetal life and genes and culture and all of that. And when you look closely at that,

52:41.280 --> 52:48.000
there isn't a crack in that edifice of biology, interacting environment from what your ancestors

52:48.000 --> 52:53.360
were up to, to what happened a millisecond ago. There isn't a crack in there in which you can

52:53.360 --> 52:58.640
shoehorn in this non-biological notion that there's free will.

53:00.880 --> 53:09.280
So one of my coaches has been talking to me about meditation and other things,

53:09.920 --> 53:16.000
and shares this famous quote from Victor Frankel, between stimulus and response,

53:16.000 --> 53:24.240
there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our

53:24.240 --> 53:29.840
growth and our freedom. And I've always loved this quote. But in light of your recent book,

53:29.840 --> 53:40.320
what are your thoughts on that quote? It's beautiful. It's clearly what was needed to sustain

53:40.960 --> 53:44.880
people who survived concentration camps, and Victor Frankel was one of them,

53:45.760 --> 53:52.720
but he understood the reality of it. People who became depressed and gave up and concentration

53:52.720 --> 54:02.480
camps died. People who were able to quote, choose to hold on to what mattered to them, and you know,

54:02.480 --> 54:07.760
there are sense of self-worth and whatever, and had these amazing abilities to resist during this

54:07.760 --> 54:14.400
hellhole. They only survived if they had all those admirable traits, plus a hell of a lot of luck,

54:15.120 --> 54:19.920
because if you didn't have that luck, if your number came up today, it didn't matter how,

54:20.960 --> 54:29.200
you know, optimistic your basic temperament was. So he was taking basically the lesson that got

54:29.200 --> 54:36.240
him through that, and it's incredibly powerful. Nonetheless, that's not how the biology of it

54:36.240 --> 54:43.600
works. You look at somebody in a concentration camp who sunk into depression, and they were dead

54:43.600 --> 54:49.360
two months later, even before starvation was enough to explain it. And you look at someone

54:49.360 --> 54:56.160
like Victor Frankel, who was able to find meaning in life, which plus a hell of a lot of luck,

54:56.160 --> 55:00.160
got him out the other end. And it's not by chance that those two people differed.

55:00.640 --> 55:07.440
But maybe it's the belief in free will, in this case, was more important than actual free will.

55:07.440 --> 55:14.400
Absolutely. On the other hand, if you believe you were responsible for the fact that you

55:14.400 --> 55:22.000
haven't become rich, just because you happened to have been born poor, that's not a very good

55:22.000 --> 55:27.600
recipe for coming out the other end, feeling good about yourself. Okay, here's a great example of

55:27.600 --> 55:32.640
this. Like one of the stupidest ways in which we could think about, ooh, biology affects our

55:32.640 --> 55:40.400
perceptions of us, like the shape of your skull, the shape of your skull, how symmetrical it is,

55:40.400 --> 55:46.880
whether the zygomatic arches underneath your eyes that make your cheekbones are of a particular

55:46.880 --> 55:52.160
shape or, you know, yeah, it's got nothing to do with free will. It's got to do, we know, bone,

55:52.240 --> 55:59.360
morphogenic proteins and all of that. And it just so happens that in one realm,

56:00.000 --> 56:05.600
if you luck out and you have one of these nice symmetrical faces that counts as more attractive,

56:06.320 --> 56:13.040
people like you more. They treat you better. They unconsciously are more cooperative with you.

56:13.040 --> 56:18.960
They're more likely to vote for you. So you get somebody who like is sitting in the corner office

56:18.960 --> 56:24.480
and part of it is that they've got magnificent cheekbones and, whoa, there's no free will. Maybe

56:24.480 --> 56:28.640
you shouldn't feel quite so proud of all your accomplishments because your cheekbones are just

56:28.640 --> 56:35.920
the first of the zoolian things that you didn't control. But then in another setting, if you're

56:35.920 --> 56:42.640
sitting in a defendancy in a courtroom and you happen to have those cheekbones that are not of

56:42.640 --> 56:49.920
the beautiful type, you're more likely to get convicted. The attractiveness of a defendant

56:51.600 --> 56:57.120
influences for the same exact circumstances with mock turies and experiments, the likelihood of

56:57.120 --> 57:06.160
getting convicted. People who are more attractive, African American men who have less aphro stereotypical

57:06.160 --> 57:11.680
features to their face are less likely to get convicted. That's not stop feeling so good about

57:11.680 --> 57:18.480
yourself about your corner office that you were more likely to get sent to jail because of this

57:18.480 --> 57:24.080
like dumbass business about the symmetry of your skull. What kind of world is this?

57:24.960 --> 57:32.240
What does 18 to 20 year old listening to this podcast who does not have a symmetrical face

57:32.240 --> 57:40.400
to make of what you just said? It sucks. It sucks because this is a very deeply ingrained

57:42.560 --> 57:50.480
you know, primates and other animals like more attractive organisms, fruit flies,

57:50.480 --> 57:56.800
like more symmetrical ones. And symmetrical here is just like the tip of the iceberg of all the

57:56.800 --> 58:08.640
versions of good biological luck. It sucks. Amid that, the notion that there is an average, that

58:08.640 --> 58:16.000
there is a norm out there. This is what a normal person is supposed to look like. This is a normal

58:16.000 --> 58:21.280
height. This is a normal degree of extroversion. This is a normal degree of beauty. This is a

58:21.280 --> 58:30.480
normal. Normal is an emergent artifact. There is no normal. There is no human who is normal. And

58:30.480 --> 58:37.840
normal is an artifact that every one of those traits just to get all like chaos theory stuff

58:37.840 --> 58:45.760
is a strange attractor. Nobody is normal. What we call normal is people whose collections of traits

58:45.760 --> 58:50.960
are statistically closest to what we've decided counts as desirable and healthy.

58:51.600 --> 58:54.800
There's no normal out there that you're failing to live up to.

58:55.360 --> 59:04.240
Is there something interesting on the other side of this that someone listening to this or even

59:04.240 --> 59:11.760
myself, when I hear you don't have free will, I'm like, hell yeah, I do. I'm going to show you.

59:12.400 --> 59:20.000
And it actually becomes a flipping moment where it may not actually be free will, but it may become

59:20.000 --> 59:27.280
dedication or motivation that was nationed within them towards some life of purpose or something

59:27.280 --> 59:32.320
different that was triggered by someone telling them they didn't have free will. What do you think

59:32.320 --> 59:38.960
about that? Yeah, here's a scenario I've experienced. Like I can almost see it coming

59:38.960 --> 59:45.040
and I'm like not trying to sound snarky here, but like it's kind of like this. I'm sitting there. I

59:45.040 --> 59:50.160
have office hours. Two students are there taking my class and they're saying, I don't know about

59:50.160 --> 59:56.080
this free will stuff. But you know, what about I feel like I'm having free will and I'm saying

59:56.080 --> 01:00:01.040
there's no free will. And here's the biological explanation for what you just brought up. And

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:08.880
at an incredibly high rate over my like 40 years of doing this, at some point, one of the students

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:16.560
is going to lean forward, pick up a pen and say, I just decided to pick up that pen. Are you telling

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:24.240
me I had no free will on this? And over these years, asking the question, which of those two

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:32.080
students are going to do that? And I will bet you I have about 85 90% predictability. If I know

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:39.120
one of them is male, one of them is female. I'm betting it's more likely to be the male.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:44.880
One of them is male, who is heterosexual and the female is attractive. I'm betting it's more

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:50.640
likely to be the male. One of them is first generation from an immigrant group that came here

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:56.160
as refugees. They're less likely to challenge me. One of them hates their father and I keep

01:00:56.160 --> 01:01:01.680
reminding them of that. They're more likely to challenge me. One of them had higher testosterone

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:06.400
levels this morning. They're the one who's more likely to challenge. One of them has more self

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.440
esteem problems. And the one time they stood up to a bully in middle school, they got a sense of

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:17.200
self esteem from that they're more likely to give me all tell me how their frontal cortex is wired.

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:23.200
Tell me what their fetal life was like. Tell me what culture. Tell me if their fourth generation

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:28.880
going to my like elite school or if they got into the first generation, fourth generation,

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:35.760
they're much more likely to want to take on some like dead white males sitting there. First generation,

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:41.920
they're more likely to feel grateful or intimidated about challenging. Like throw all those variables

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:50.800
together. And I got like 90% predictability with that. And that's because where did that intent

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.000
to pick up that pen just come from? Where did that intent and the other person did not pick

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.720
up the pen where it came from? It came from one second before and a decade before and a thousand

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:08.800
years before and all of that. Wow. I was about to tell you something that happened to me this

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:14.400
morning. But but then you're going to psychoanalyze me. But on the days of our podcast, I go for a

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:19.680
long bike ride because it oxygenates me and I came back and I was craving like protein,

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:28.480
an omelet with cheese. And I was opening the fridge. And I just, it wasn't like I'm going to show

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:33.440
Robert, it was unbidden to me. And I said, you know what, I'm not going to have an omelet. I'm

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:39.520
going to have an oatmeal. So I didn't want oatmeal, but I just approved myself. It's a tiny little

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:46.160
trivial example. But is that free will that in the moment I changed what I wanted to do,

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.760
but kind of because I wanted to prove you wrong a little bit or what's going on there?

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:57.840
No, of course not. There was no free will there at all. Like if you, okay, as a canonical example,

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:04.160
if you grow up thinking your parents are the greatest and as an adult, you wind up exactly

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:10.720
like them, you didn't choose to be that way. If you grow up and circumstances has caused you to

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:16.560
hate and despise your parents and as an adult, you make sure you do exactly the opposite of them

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:23.120
in every single possible domain, you're just as determined. You're just as there's no more free

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.480
will in that case than the other. Or if you've decided you love some of these attributes of them

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:34.000
and hate others, so you're a hybrid of them. Okay, so you this morning after the bike ride looking

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:42.800
in there. So first thing, where'd your self reflection come from? You didn't choose to be

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.000
someone capable of like emotionally intelligent self reflection and examination of your motives

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.920
and behaviors. Next, where did your sense of like to the extent that I represent any sort of like

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:04.000
neurobiological authority, where did your sense of like occasionally challenging their bullshit

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.560
come from? You're higher up on the baboon hierarchy than me. Well, in talking about how

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:16.080
neurons work, I definitely am. In navigating the social world, my guess is I'm definitely not, but

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.800
where did where did you become the sort of person who would want to say some version of

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:30.480
I'm going to show them? Where did you become somebody who would have critical thinking and

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:36.720
enough respect for critical thinking to think critically and say this maybe constitutes a

01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:45.120
refutation of this stance where that didn't come from nowhere. If you had grown up marinating an

01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.000
alcohol from your mom when you were a fetus, you wouldn't have been capable of that critical

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:56.320
self reflection. If you had grown up in a culture where they said what you were told is true and

01:04:56.320 --> 01:05:03.840
do not challenge authority, or if you were thrown growing up in a culture where you're like ethos is

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:09.120
anything the man says is bullshit and you should challenge it, you didn't choose which of those

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:16.480
cultures and every one of those steps along the way, nor did you choose the neurochemical

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:24.160
makeup of the part of your brain that does starch craving versus protein craving. And depending on

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:30.080
how those two places were wired through no credit to you, it would have something to do with how

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.880
readily you could think about this intellectual thought experiment of taking on this stance

01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:38.960
that there's no free will and showing that it's not really the case here by foregoing

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:46.640
starch instead of protein. Maybe in some other case you're the reinforcement you would get from

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:52.960
one of those was so powerful that you would do the I'm going to show him in some other setting.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:59.760
You're going to wait for the next elevator instead of cramming in there. You see I chose to do that

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:05.520
because you happen to have a brain this wired for really, really liking like starch after a bike

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:11.520
ride. So that's not where you would have done that experiment. Every one of those steps, none of that

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:18.640
was free. So actually that brings up another kind of profound insight while you were speaking and I

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:23.680
don't I don't want to make all these examples about me. But when we're talking about free will,

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:32.480
I only know my own brain. So I worked on Wall Street, I was a teacher and then all of a sudden

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:38.880
I've got this podcast and it's becoming more popular. I'm getting emails from around the world.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:45.200
I'm getting traction with people in government, with universities and it feels like my life is no

01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:57.440
longer my own. And listening to you speaking, it makes me even more have a fiduciary responsibility

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:06.240
to these times and to help midwife society through to a softer landing than the defaults.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:13.600
And you talking about that we don't free have free will actually makes me feel more

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:21.920
of of that drive and and that, you know, acting as a golden retriever,

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:27.520
Overton Windows sort of a vector in these conversations. What's going on there as I'm

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:34.560
feeling that? Well, once again, you're proving there's no free will because

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:41.440
lots of other people at your juncture would decide it's hopeless. And instead, you take this

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:47.120
information and you've turned it into some sort of moral imperative to try to like make the world

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:54.160
whole. That doesn't happen by chance. That's not random who's capable of doing that. Lots of people

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:59.840
who find out about this like collapse into like self interest or a nihilistic nothingness or

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:06.080
sure. Where did that response come from? That's an incredibly healthy response, especially for

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:12.240
all the people in the world around you. That's a great way as and that didn't come from out of

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:19.840
nowhere. Nothing comes from nothing. But like your dad had 14% of the architects had learned

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.920
from him, cultural evolution can happen that way, irrespective of whether there is free will or not.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:35.200
Of course, but whether culture evolves isn't dependent on whether or not there's free will.

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:42.240
I don't think there is free will. Cultural phenomenon could be explained with the same

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.760
biology interacting with environment, blah, blah, blah, that I've been spouting.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.240
Cultural evolution could be explained by the myth of free will as well. It's in some ways

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.440
a separate topic until you start getting into what were the nuts and bolts about how the culture

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:08.160
just evolved. What about free won't? About 10 years ago, I like you love dogs and I realized

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:14.080
that pigs were smarter than dogs or as smart. One of my favorite things to eat was bacon,

01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:19.920
lettuce and tomato sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't eat meat and I'm giving up pork,

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:26.960
but it was very difficult. I created this image in my head of trucks on the highway that had pigs

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:34.880
in them, but instead they were dogs. I had this visceral negative response to any menu with pork

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:44.240
on it and I haven't had pork in 10 years. That's not free will, but I call it free won't. I decided

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:50.720
something that was ethically important to me and I created a way for my neocortex to

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:54.080
trump my limbic system in the moment. How do you explain that?

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.800
It's a little bit of a semantic issue as to what counts as free will versus free won't.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:07.360
Your experience can be an example of free won't. I'm not going to eat pig anymore,

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:12.240
or it could be an example of free will. I'm going to stick to a moral stance of mine,

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:18.800
so it's a little bit semantic. Insofar as it's semantic, it's the same answer.

01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:27.920
Where'd that free won't come from in you? First off, where'd your knowledge of what gets done

01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:34.960
to pigs? Where did your love of dogs come from? Where did your capacity to generalize empathy

01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:40.640
from dogs to pigs? Where did your knowledge of pig intelligence come from? Where did your frontal

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:48.400
cortex get the means for you to look at the bacon lettuce tomato sandwich on the menu,

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:57.920
and somehow to suppress the associated cravings and instead pull up an image of terrified dogs

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:06.240
in a transport truck? Your mother did something right by you that you have a frontal cortex that

01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:14.080
was capable of regulating impulsive cravings to that extent, because that got constructed at you

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:22.160
at some point. Your brain is of a type where whatever rewards bacon gives to your the correct

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:29.200
neurons in there, it's not so powerful that it overwhelms your capacity for, you know,

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:35.120
emotional regulation, and it's quite possible that you have lurking in there a craving for

01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:41.040
something else that you wouldn't be able to override. You have not because you lack

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:48.000
self-confidence, self-discipline there, but because, oh, you're wiring, you know, Ben and Jerry's

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.440
ice cream sets off neurons that will not be said no to, but bacon didn't once you set your conscious

01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:04.960
frontal cortex to it sufficiently. So if there is free will, would it reside in the

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:14.480
frontal cortex? Well, again, not to sound snarky, but that's a hard one for me to answer, because

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:23.600
that's, in a sense, asking me if the tooth fairy existed, which much neurons would

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:30.960
let me rephrase the question. Let me rephrase the question. So in the Amazon bio for determined,

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:38.080
they write that Sapolsky mounts a full frontal assault on the pleasant fantasy that there is

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:45.520
some separate self telling our biology what to do, but couldn't biology itself in our ancestral

01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:53.280
environment created via evolution and adaptation such a separate self from novel historical

01:12:53.280 --> 01:13:02.320
circumstances that that is the part of a body that exerts control in certain situations in my

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:16.000
situation to decide not to eat pork? Well, yes and no. This puts us into sort of your area of

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.560
like thinking about emergence. This is totally cool phenomenon. One of the like most interesting

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.840
things about neuroscience is you take a neuron from a fruit fly and you take a neuron from us

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.720
and they're the same thing. They're the same cell. They use the same neurotransmitters, the same wiring.

01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:39.600
We did not become human because we invented new parts of the brain or new types of neurotransmitters.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:46.880
What happened instead is one of those more is different scenarios of we've got 100 million

01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:53.440
neurons for every neuron that a fly has and you put that many of them together and unexpected

01:13:54.240 --> 01:14:01.840
complicated adaptive totally beautiful stuff emerges and the interesting stuff in our brains

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:07.760
are a merchant phenomenon like you give a chimp as many neurons as us and it would come up with

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.640
theology. It would come up with a totally different theology and it would come up with aesthetics and

01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:21.920
would come up with okay so why isn't free will just an emergent phenomenon? The belief in free will,

01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:28.880
the invention of the notion, the emotional connectedness to it and dependence upon the notion

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:37.120
is certainly emergent but free will is not because neurons don't work that way.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.560
Okay what do I mean by that? The coolest thing about emergence is you take an ant

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.640
and it's making no sense at all and you put 10 ants and they're just doing random incoherent

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:57.680
stuff and you put 10,000 of them and they build a whole society and it's not because

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:04.560
when you get 10,000 of them suddenly the ants understand geometry or something. They know

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:12.320
exactly the same simple stupid few local neighbor interaction rules that they did when there was

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:19.280
just three of them but when you put enough of them together out pops this and all of the models

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:28.800
for how free will can be an emergent property requires you to break that rule and instead allow

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:34.800
that once you get enough ants together all of the ants can speak French and once you get neurons

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:42.240
together all of them could work in ways that the physical universe doesn't allow. The coolest thing

01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:48.800
about like emergence is you look at our brains inventing stuff and we're made out of the same

01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:56.480
cells as Drosophila brains are and they're still doing the same stupid things. The amazingness is

01:15:57.200 --> 01:16:04.320
what is like totally provincial three or four local neighbor rules and suddenly you throw enough

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:12.240
of them together and they're still just as simple. That's the thing that makes me like almost want

01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:20.560
to weep at how cool emergence is and it explains so many things out there but any model in which

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:28.960
you have to speculate that the emergent meta-level property now suddenly gets the ability to reach

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:36.000
down to the micro level of the constituent parts and make them work differently in much cooler

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:42.000
ways it can't work that way and every version of free will coming out of an emergence requires that.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:49.920
So my work and you watched my movie recently looks at the emergent constraints of the macro

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:57.120
human economy the eight billion ants eight billion humans that no one is in control and that society

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:06.960
at least for now is this functioning as an energy hungry super organism but your recent work suggests

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:14.320
the same is happening at the micro level in an individual brain of sorts so am I correct in saying

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:23.920
that biology constrains both our micro and our macro systems but it doesn't determine it what do

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:31.600
you think about that? Well of course I'm going to disagree because I don't think it just constrains

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:36.800
when you look at all of the biological influences from the second ago to a million years ago and

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:43.840
you look at all the ways that biology interacts with environment not only isn't it constraining

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:51.120
or facilitating that's all there is that is what's there that is who we are that is

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:58.320
how we arrived at being who we are at this moment there's nothing but that but you bring up

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:05.520
in your bringing up the micro level stuff one of the like inevitable things that people get

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:11.120
pulled to at this point which is oh a deterministic universe and deterministic interactions of

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.120
deterministic biology and interactive ways with deterministic environment blah blah blah etc

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:24.640
what about quantum indeterminacy and what's that because you that you get down at a sufficiently

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:34.160
micro subatomic level and events right now were not caused by the events that just came before that

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:42.240
there is complete unpredictable randomness about how subatomic particles work and people

01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.960
still like are boggled by it and don't fully understand it and there's still like a counter

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.640
revolutionary old guard of physicists who say there's got to be actually a deterministic thing

01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:01.440
lurking in there someplace but on a very very subatomic level things appear not to be deterministic

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:07.120
and are totally random and thus what do you know there's a whole school of philosophers who say

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:14.320
free will comes out of quantum indeterminism and that doesn't make any sense either so let me go

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:21.520
down a little bit of an academic rabbit hole here my phd advisor who's since passed away

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:27.040
trials good night was an evolutionary biologist who focused on multi-level selection the fact

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:35.840
that it wasn't just selfishness but it was the individual competitiveness with group behavior

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:43.840
with maybe some bacteria or things in your gut that our selection was happened at multiple

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:52.320
different levels and he called that contextual analysis so with respect to free will doesn't

01:19:52.320 --> 01:20:00.480
it depend on multiple scales and dimensions like what's happened to an organism's life

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:08.000
we say organisms have will which might also describe as desire or preference so an organism

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.800
feels hunger okay so it seeks food finds it eats is satisfied then other drivers come kick in after

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:22.160
it's satisfied it has defense or shelter or to go to the bathroom or to mate so these are all

01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:28.640
genetic programs with chemical rewards but what about this case the organism feels hunger

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:36.080
but because of the complexity of its emotions its life the society um it considers whether or not

01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:42.880
to act on that feeling and especially if it's a human organism such a complex animal with

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:49.680
hundreds of millions of neurons it might weigh or defer or change the paths because of these other

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:56.640
contexts in its life so how does context fit in with free will especially with human animals

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:04.960
it's beautiful it's incredibly important and I have I have such respect for multi-level

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:10.320
selection people just because they were like out crying of the wilderness for such a long time

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:17.840
people like David Sloan Wilson and he's been on my podcast yeah okay he's great and he was like

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:27.360
pariah for yeah like until uh not in an active kin selection but David Sloan Wilson and EO

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.480
Wilson decided that they actually agreed on more things than they disagreed about and it was like

01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:38.800
totally beautiful and the resolution was context in some settings this is the most appropriate

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:46.800
level of analysis at the level of groups in some settings it's you know genomic non-expressed DNA

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:52.640
and you're looking at selfish DNA at sometimes just the whole genome is sometimes and yeah it's

01:21:52.640 --> 01:22:01.120
context dependent and context is like the most interesting thing about us because like this

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:06.720
was my last book was all about this uh you know the biology of our best behaviors and our worst

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:15.360
behaviors what's most interesting about it is you could have the exact same behavior the same

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:21.680
neurons telling the same muscles do the same exact thing and depending on the context you could just

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:27.920
be ethnically cleansing a village or you could be Mother Teresa in one setting pulling a trigger

01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:33.680
is like self-sacrificial and amazing and in another it's like one of the most heartless things to do

01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:41.520
like the motoric aspects of the behavior we carry out yeah that's kind of interesting

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:47.280
to learn the biology that there's nowhere near as interesting as what it means in that context

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:56.960
and that's exactly what all of this is about so your dog just shook his head and I heard the chain

01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:03.840
and the chain reminded me that you have a golden retriever in your office and that made me happy

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.760
and it made me more positive and maybe that changed the framing of my next question so that's also

01:23:09.840 --> 01:23:16.960
context or is that totally unrelated to free will okay so that's context that that's that's

01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:26.080
one of the sets of webs which went all wound together and in that case context was about

01:23:26.080 --> 01:23:32.720
five minutes long knowing I had a golden but also 30 years long since you were growing up with

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:39.600
goldens and 40 000 years long since you were of a culture that like likes dogs instead of eating

01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:48.240
them all of that but yeah that's exactly where that came from so how do you define Robert the

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:55.120
difference between free will and agency do you feel any sort of agency in your life and how do you

01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:02.640
still feel a drive to contribute to good in the world if you don't see us as as having free will

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:11.840
well this is where like there's no such thing as free will there's no such thing as agency

01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:19.760
a criminal justice system that uses the notion of responsibility and blame and punish punishment

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:27.360
makes no sense whatsoever at the same time a meritocracy that runs on notions of praise and

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:36.960
reward makes just as little sense none of it makes any sense and someone like telling you you did

01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:42.160
something rotten ultimately if you really really believe it makes as little sense as saying that

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.920
earthquake did something rotten and someone telling you just did something great and what a good job

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:54.000
makes as little sense is telling a flower that's a great like odor that do you release a fragrance

01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:00.320
or whatever like that's the reality how in hell do you function that way how do i function that way

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:08.480
i function that way about one tenth of one percent of the time where i truly truly am able to think

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.800
i don't deserve anything i am not entitled to anything i have earned nothing where i truly

01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:20.320
can think hating somebody makes as little sense as hating an earthquake yeah i could pull that

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:27.120
off for about three and a half seconds at a time before i fall into my lifetime of cultural training

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:35.280
um or framed a different way one tenth of one percent of the time i can actually function

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:41.760
in a way that i think is the only morally acceptable way for us to function in other words it's not

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:48.640
easy and like we all got a long way to go with it but at least start trying to think that way in

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:56.160
the domains that really matter uh when you're deciding like who gets a life sentence without

01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:02.400
parole or when you're deciding who gets a corporate salary that's a hundred times higher than the

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:08.800
people working in the warehouse and like if you don't want to have to try to figure out why that

01:26:08.800 --> 01:26:16.320
explains why you like uh you know bacon constitutively more than you like ben and jerry's that's fine

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:21.760
you know leave the science alone for that just go with your instincts that there's agency there

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.600
but when it comes to the big stuff if we can only pull it off some of the time that's where we have

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:35.520
the moral obligation to do that so what are the societal i mean you've spent years presumably

01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:40.160
writing this book and you said that you've been since you were 13 you believe this way

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:47.120
so you've obviously thought about the implications of this could we use the the scientific uh

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:53.520
foundations that you outline and determined uh to influence the behavior or the policies the

01:26:53.520 --> 01:27:03.520
institutions of our world in a positive way well i guess at this point am i going to sound like an

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:13.120
npr tote bag toting liberal or am i going to sound like someone who's much more left in my extreme

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.560
or am i going to sound someone who's so far out like i'm not even in the same playing field in

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:29.120
terms of lunatic fringe the only it puts you at the lunatic fringe somebody tells you nice cheek

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:36.720
bones and that makes this little sense to feel good afterward as somebody telling you have a good

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:42.880
moral philosophy and you have just used that to make a million lives better and thank you for being

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:50.320
that person that makes this little none of it makes any sense if you really really follow this stuff out

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:57.680
and the cheekbone end it doesn't really matter but getting people to think more correctly about

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:06.000
punishment and reward and who deserves anything um and whether hate ever makes sense at all

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:12.800
that's where it has some major societal consequences i mean just you know as one example of that

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:20.880
we understand how epilepsy works to some degree there was a time when people didn't and if somebody

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:25.520
had an epileptic seizure what they did to you in their 15th century village was burn you at the

01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:32.320
stake because you were demonically possessed whoa understanding how this stuff works has societal

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:41.120
implications that's thousands of people who were burned at the stake understanding that schizophrenia

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:48.720
isn't caused by crappy psychodynamically hostile mothering and instead a neurogenetic disorder

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:56.160
whoa that makes a big difference in how the world works and in every one of these cases

01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.880
it makes for a more humane world it's like really good that we don't burn people with

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:07.120
epilepsy at the stakes or tell mothers of teenagers who've just been diagnosed with schizophrenia

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:14.240
some Freudian bile that you caused it because unconsciously you hate your child like it's a

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:19.840
better world at each one of these steps so what what is the difference between a deterministic

01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:29.200
world which you are describing and a fatalistic or nihilistic mindset or worldview great um

01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:39.280
the fatalistic one is the worst place you could arrive from all of this stuff which is to look at

01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:46.160
all of these biological threads around our fingers and all of these environmental and all

01:29:46.160 --> 01:29:51.680
these biology environment interaction threads and and collectively they're much more than threads

01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:59.040
they're a gigantic cocoon blah blah blah to conclude nothing can change so why bother

01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:08.960
what you proved is something can change you don't eat bacon anymore um it's not really

01:30:08.960 --> 01:30:15.840
because you chose to no longer eat bacon it's because you were you were changed previously

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:22.000
in life in ways that made it possible for you to learn about pig intelligence and to evoke

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:28.880
images of puppies and trucks we don't change we don't choose to change but we sure are changed

01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:35.840
and we have to make use of our knowledge about how that change comes about because if we don't

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:42.400
think the change happens we're totally screwed nihilism is not like a very happy picture for how

01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:47.920
we should go about looking at what else there is out there so this is really a huge call to

01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.720
changing our cultural environment but really to education um and many other things because

01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:02.720
humans can change but only if our two seconds ago one month ago five years ago 40 years ago

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:10.480
and we can't change the 40 years ago or the 400 years ago but we can change our cultural stimuli

01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:16.880
at least in theory right so education and and moving in the direction of some of these pro-social

01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:23.440
outcomes will be able to change other people and empower them to do the environmental equivalent

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:31.360
of giving up pork or whatever it is absolutely so you get somebody who because of environmental

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:39.840
events learns that something crummy is going on in Ukraine and they say wow I'm going to educate

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:48.000
myself about the history of like Slavic you know tribalism or whatever and they come out the other

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.800
end and tell people you know any of this Putin saying this is about NATO this is about this is

01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.560
nonsense in the 19th century the Russians were saying the Ukrainians couldn't use their own

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:07.280
language this is centuries old what have you just done there you have been exposed to environmental

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:12.720
stimuli telling you that something's going on in Ukraine and you decide I'm going to learn

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:19.920
more about it how do you turn into the sort of person who at that juncture would say I'm even

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:25.760
interested in the news I want to learn more about it I'm going to use my critical thinking to see

01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:31.520
maybe one of the stories being spouted here isn't actually all that accurate who taught you

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:36.960
challenge stuff like that who taught you to read who to blah blah all the ways in which you could

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:43.200
have been a different person in no ways that you can control and once that brought about a change in

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:49.200
you whoa this has nothing to do with NATO this has to do with different Slavic tribes hating

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:55.600
each other for half a millennium then you're capable of telling that to somebody else and

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:03.920
perhaps they're in a position to be changed by that as a result like on the most basic like

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:09.040
concrete are you kidding me you know yeah actually the world needs to work this way

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:16.720
if you've been listening to this podcast and you've decided this is incredibly galvanizing to you

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:21.200
or if you've decided this is totally wrong or if you've decided this is boring or if you've

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:29.280
decided you really want to get like a cookie your brain is structurally different than it was two

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:36.560
seconds ago because it has to be that's how it works if what you've concluded is this is boring

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:41.120
I'm going to get a cookie your brain has probably changed in a way that's not going to have a whole

01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:47.200
lot of long-term consequences but somewhere in there there are three and a half synapses

01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:52.480
that are now working differently than they were working 10 minutes ago they may no longer be

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:57.680
working differently 10 minutes from now it's a very transient effect or if this decides

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:01.840
makes you decide you're going to go out and become like a Baptist preacher or something

01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:10.240
that change persisted but everything something just changed in your brain in a way that is

01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:18.400
ultimately only explainable by the physical universe and thus like you go get a cookie

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:24.000
or thus you go devote the rest of your life to a different cause than you would have 10 minutes ago

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:29.840
because that's all there is there's nothing more than that in anything more you would invoke to

01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:38.160
explain that you're invoking magic that defies how the physical universe works and how emergent

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:43.760
systems work and whether or not quantum indeterminacy has anything to do with what

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:51.680
you order on the menu it simply doesn't work that way why did you write this book it wasn't free

01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:57.520
will you had to have an idea in your mind other than getting the science right you've been a

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:04.320
lifelong scholar of the human and and primate brain but what was your hope in in writing this book

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:11.600
um well everything ranging from

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:22.320
to make this a more human humane world to showing those asshole bullies when I was 14

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:29.680
year old in junior high and they were bullying me look what I've done to making money to having

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:36.800
people think I'm a kind person to having people think I have nice cheekbones because they're

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.880
confusing writing a good book with all sorts of other things that have nothing to do with it and

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:47.920
are not based in reality yeah all this stuff because my parents wanted me to be a doctor and

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:53.440
they went to their graves wanting me to be a doctor and I turned it to this instead yeah look at this

01:35:53.440 --> 01:36:01.120
look at you see you see because they wanted me to be a critical thinker yeah look at this you see

01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:07.520
so it had to come out this book had it was like you had to give birth to this book as a natural

01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:14.560
continuum of your life's work yeah but in the exact same way but in a much less interesting

01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.480
level that I forgot to bring the charger with me when I went from outside back to here

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:27.760
so I mean I love all of your books I've read about a third of this one because it's 500 pages

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:38.000
and 10s and I've been really busy but I can see this book striking a nerve especially with

01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:44.240
what's going on in our social discourse today are you worried at all about the academic

01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:52.240
public response to this book it could there be a similar drama like there was created by

01:36:52.240 --> 01:37:01.040
Richard Dawkins's selfish gene in the 70s which was a naive interpretation of selfishness back

01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:06.960
then but could there be a naive interpretation of the science that could rationalize apathy

01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:12.960
and nihilism are you are you excited about that do you have some trepidation what are you what can

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:22.480
you share um and by the way characterizing that is naive with Dawkins is exactly one would get

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:31.600
from a card-carrying multi-level selectionist yeah I'm pretty pretty damn naive and uh and dogmatic

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:38.880
but but it but it did become popular and it was grabbed by people to rationalize look humans are

01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:45.040
naturally this way which was an incorrect interpretation but are you worried that we might

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:50.880
get the same reaction with your book I don't have any free will that's what made me do it I wasn't my

01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:59.840
fault um absolutely and some of that's exciting and some of that's terrifying because I'm just like

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:09.840
this torpy professor sitting someplace and if somebody decides um like maligning their religious

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:16.160
beliefs or at the other end of the spectrum if I'm maligning their social identity and their

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:24.240
validation of it or and they're gonna hate me that's gonna suck um I I have a bit of a conundrum

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:32.960
in that intellectually um very very combative and love it and interpersonally I am totally meek

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:41.760
and skittish so there's going to be an interesting balancing of those tendencies

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:48.720
depending on how much somebody hates my ideas versus if they wind up hating me I get it so

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.680
intellectually Robert how could you be wrong about this is there an experiment or something

01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:04.400
that you could discover that would change your mind that humans have free will absolutely um

01:39:04.960 --> 01:39:12.640
and conveniently it's an impossible experiment but what the hell um okay you've just done something

01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:19.040
with like incredible consequence you've pulled a trigger as highly context-dependent like this

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:27.120
matters it makes a difference and it's possible to track down like the one little node of neurons

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:34.960
that told your muscle to do that so let's look at that node of neurons if you could show me

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:42.000
they would have done the exact same thing regardless of what any of the neighboring neurons

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:50.160
did in the previous seconds that's kind of interesting and impressive but then show me

01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:57.200
that they would have done the exact same thing regardless of what you had for breakfast whether

01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:02.240
you were tired scared stressed aroused whatever and then show me it would have done the same thing

01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:06.880
no matter what your hormone levels were and show me they would have done the exact same thing

01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:11.920
whether you grew up in an individualist or a collectivist culture and show me that if you

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:17.680
changed every gene inside those neurons into the set of genes that the person sitting next to you

01:40:17.680 --> 01:40:23.760
had do all of those things and if those neurons still made you do the exact same thing you've

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:37.200
just proven free will go good luck yeah yeah i see um okay i i as i said i have hours of questions

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:43.120
for you but i want to be respectful of your time i have one more question related to your book

01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:49.120
and your work and then and then we'll get to the closing questions that i ask all my guests so

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:59.760
what might be some some key components or even key questions uh in a new systems informed design

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:07.200
of society based on an understanding of neuroscience physiology and and no free will

01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:17.840
um writ small a huge challenge for the field is we know a lot about how like a neuron works

01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:25.280
or a little a little circuit of neurons and we know about like the kind of stuff that brains

01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:34.160
produce like ideology or or love or things like that it's really tough the scaling up problem the

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:41.200
intermediate range is the big challenge um because traditionally you could look at the electrical

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:48.960
activity of three neurons at a time now these days you can canvas activity in 10 000 neurons

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:55.760
and look at their gene expression profiles and you get these massive bioinformatic data sets and

01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:02.160
nobody is smart enough to be able to think in 11 dimensions at once so the connecting the two

01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:08.240
levels okay so that's uh let's see i hope lots of grad students are able to do that in the centuries

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:21.520
to come um the much bigger to do is how do we get past this sense that uh judgment makes sense

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:33.920
and punishment makes sense and praise makes sense and that somebody really isn't responsible for the

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:39.360
most wondrous things you can imagine or the most damaging and how do you get past that fact

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.880
that in the right circumstances it feels really good to punish someone for righteous reasons

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:53.280
how are you going to do this but you know three four hundred years ago people managed to do that

01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:00.320
in thinking about the biologically deterministic phenomenon of epilepsy and subtract satan out

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:06.960
of it and we've done it over and over again in all sorts of other realms this kid is having trouble

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:12.640
reading because of a biologically deterministic thing called dyslexia not because they're lazy

01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:17.120
we've done it we've done it over and over we got to do it over and over again

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:25.840
i sometimes feel that we're in this like twilight zone movie and often in my lectures i say that

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.760
we've arrived at a species level conversation that we're the first generation of homo sapiens

01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:39.600
to be able to not not necessarily that we are but we have the ability to figure out where we

01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:45.840
came from how we got here what we're doing to each other to the planet what our biology is

01:43:45.840 --> 01:43:51.840
what we actually need what our natural resource balance sheet is or that of the earth and it

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:58.400
feels like your story is a piece of this it's like looking in the mirror at homo sapiens and

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:04.640
looking all around us and are we gonna have enough time to integrate this stuff do you get that feeling

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:13.760
or how do you respond to what i just said absolutely uh as as a way of kind of summarizing everything

01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:21.840
you preach about the clocks ticking and we got a lot of stuff to overcome and a lot of

01:44:21.840 --> 01:44:31.520
it taps into this sort of frame from my view of the world what is the universe of circumstance

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:39.360
that has made us into a species that's insatiable why was something wonderful yesterday not enough

01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:46.800
tomorrow why are there a few exceptions to that why are there some people who didn't turn out that

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:52.080
way how can we you know opportunize knowledge about that to get to save the world in time

01:44:52.880 --> 01:45:00.000
whereas your level of solving the same problem is uh hey you know oil reserves are not going to

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:06.560
last forever this is an anomaly you know there's all these different levels of attacking the same

01:45:06.560 --> 01:45:13.600
problem uh the clock is ticking we're running out of all sorts of important stuff and it's very

01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:24.640
much in our nature to be awful to have knots when times get bad and like go for it there's no

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:30.800
shortage of approaches that are desperately needed to try to fix some of this stuff what what would

01:45:30.800 --> 01:45:37.200
you like the viewers and listeners of this podcast to take away from this brief overview

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:44.720
a little bit of your earlier work but primarily your new book determined a science of life without

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:52.640
free will well how how would you like people to to take this subject on after hearing this

01:45:52.640 --> 01:46:02.240
this isn't scary because oh my god science i hated ninth grade biology this isn't scary

01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:08.880
because the concepts are like inaccessible this isn't scary because it means there's no purpose

01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:15.040
in life anything but that this isn't scary because it means we're all going to run amuck

01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:22.960
the world's going to become more humane um and this isn't scary because if you're one of the

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:28.800
lucky ones it's going to make you feel like you don't deserve all the great things you've gotten

01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:34.640
you don't deserve the great things you've gotten but for most people on earth what they're going to

01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:40.080
find out is they don't deserve to have not gotten most of the great things they were deprived so this

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:48.720
is a wonderful thing so this is not oh my god this is like the roof isn't going to cave in

01:46:48.720 --> 01:46:55.600
it's going to be better afterward inter individually and on a societal level if we understand like

01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:02.320
where we're coming from and where we're coming from is it doesn't make sense to feel like you are

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:07.280
entitled to be treated better than another human and it doesn't make sense to think that there's

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:14.720
something like evil in looking at the damaging things that this collection of atoms we call humans

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:20.240
are doing versus damaging things that other collections of atoms are doing like this can

01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:26.320
only be good things and again i could manage to think this way like one percent of the time

01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:32.880
so nobody is saying this is going to be easy but like we got to try so broader than that

01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:40.000
not on the topic of free will but you've thought about the human condition and and have a career

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:46.160
choice on human behavioral biology do you have any personal advice to the viewers of this show at

01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:52.960
this time of global inequality and anxiety and crazy politics and climate change and and other

01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:58.400
things what some people would call the the poly crisis do you have any recommendations to to people

01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:05.040
all i can say is it takes a hell of a lot of work not to sink into

01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.880
a depression and a sense of helplessness and my basic nature is such that i do that with a second's

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:26.160
notice um you're not alone things can change big potentially revolutionary things could emerge

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:35.680
from a lot of little component parts uh coming together uh empathy goes a hell of a long way

01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.400
especially when it's empathy for someone where the empathy doesn't come naturally

01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:51.280
and if you want to be a primate and decrease your stress hormone levels it's great if people

01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:56.800
treat you nicely and groom you but it turns out it's even better if you groom them instead

01:48:57.920 --> 01:49:07.280
and you know maybe all these pieces together you know keeps keeps the clouds away for a few

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:15.200
more seconds at a time and you know take advantage of those few seconds and be proactive so you've

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:22.240
been teaching for 40 years or so um what recommendations do you give to your 18 to 20

01:49:22.240 --> 01:49:27.520
year old young humans that take your class at at the end after learning about this and after also

01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:34.400
living in a time of of environmental damage and social stress etc or do you not give them advice

01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:43.360
at all oh i i pontificate out the wazoo i'm i'm insufferable um and most of them appropriately

01:49:43.360 --> 01:49:51.200
glaze over at that point um what what would i tell them what do i tell them um

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:59.200
it looks really tough to make a change but by definition because of my privilege in life

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:05.680
i've wound up spending my career interacting with students who are uber privileged um so if

01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:11.360
anyone's going to do it it's you guys yeah because not only did you get to go to one of the best

01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:17.680
universities on earth you almost certainly don't have horrible gut parasites because you're one of

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:26.480
the lucky ones um maybe the next thing is this thing that fascinates me trying to make sense of

01:50:27.360 --> 01:50:32.720
in terms of like making the world whole and one of the completely irrational things we're

01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:39.360
capable of doing as humans and have to do the more hopeless the process the problem seems

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.720
the more you have to decide that you're one of the ones who can solve the problem

01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:52.560
which is a version of this impossible religious stance of the less lovable the person the more

01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:59.920
you have to find the means to love them uh you're one of the lucky ones go and do it and keep in

01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:05.120
mind it's not going to come cheap and you're going to have to make a lot of personal choices as to

01:51:05.120 --> 01:51:09.760
what you're willing to give up along the way uh no one said this is going to be easy

01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:18.960
that's kind of the underlying feeling that i'm getting from this great conversation

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:26.320
irrespective of whether i fully buy that there's no free will or not listening to you i feel that

01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:32.400
i am one of the lucky ones and i have to do more than i have been doing to pass the baton or at

01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:39.040
least you know accelerate this so that's the emotion that i'm feeling listening to you on this topic

01:51:39.040 --> 01:51:46.160
but of course i can only understand my own mind i don't understand anyone else's and to incorporate

01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:53.520
something i have to tell myself 99 percent of the time which is when you lapse and you fail to be

01:51:53.520 --> 01:52:02.080
that wonderful you're no less a biological machine yeah that's we're we're dealing with some tough

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:10.560
things here and so we have to be kind to ourselves yeah and it's like a little bit self-serving to do

01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:18.240
that almost fatuous you have to love yourself before you can love others but it helps yeah i've

01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:22.400
i'm told that often what do you care most about in the world robert

01:52:25.680 --> 01:52:40.080
um the scientist in me says being able to sit quietly and see how pieces of things fit together

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:50.480
um the 60 something this says being able to sit quietly and see how pieces of things fit together

01:52:51.120 --> 01:53:01.440
and there's less pain afterward yeah i hear you um if you could make i ask this of all my guests

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:07.680
if you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:14.640
thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures um you know knowing that you're a scientist

01:53:14.640 --> 01:53:20.320
and you don't believe in magic wands but just hypothetically well i'll take two since this is

01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:30.240
like imaginary one is that we habituate to good stuff more slowly um we may not invent that many

01:53:30.240 --> 01:53:40.240
the next big things but that's probably a good thing in the long run um and i guess the other is

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:55.200
to be able to understand all of the circumstances in which we lose empathy and to understand why it

01:53:55.200 --> 01:54:01.360
is that it's so much easier to make a neutral somebody into a them than to make them into an us

01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:09.120
let alone to make a them into an us because we can do it and there's circumstances that make it easier

01:54:09.120 --> 01:54:18.080
to do um why does adversity bring out the worst and so many of us this has been a fantastic

01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:24.640
conversation um another thought that came to my mind is 20 years ago when i started reading

01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:29.280
your books and watching your lectures was it predetermined that i would do a podcast with

01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:38.240
you in 2023 um i i so value your intellect and your heart um if you were to come back in the

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:46.800
future on this show um the free will book determined coming out soon aside what is one topic that you

01:54:46.800 --> 01:54:52.320
were passionate about relevant to human futures that you'd be curious or willing to take a deep

01:54:52.320 --> 01:55:03.680
dive with me on well one that is derivative of all of this and maybe it's because i can't think of

01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:08.400
anything these days i can't think of which socks i'm putting on without thinking about this damn

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:20.400
book i've been obsessing over since i was 13 um but maybe on the level of

01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:30.320
how do we remember that no matter what amid all of these explanations and stuff

01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:39.520
uh we're biological machines who believe they can feel sad

01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:47.280
and because of how the world works thus we actually are sad when that's happening

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:56.320
and we actually are feeling less pain when our machinist has led us to that we are biological

01:55:56.400 --> 01:56:04.560
machines who could know our machinists but it doesn't take the the emotional implications of

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:11.040
it away in the slightest it doesn't make pleasure any less pleasurable unhappiness and it doesn't

01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:18.080
make pain any less painful i'm going to think about that um thank you so much uh professor

01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.000
sepalski for for your time today and for your your work and we will uh post a link to your book

01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:30.720
online and let's you and i stay in touch good let's do that this was totally fun and

01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:37.760
meeting a a distant cousin who not only likes multi-level selection but emergence so

01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:44.320
well we're also distant cousins from when pro console came down from the tree 17 million years ago

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:52.720
