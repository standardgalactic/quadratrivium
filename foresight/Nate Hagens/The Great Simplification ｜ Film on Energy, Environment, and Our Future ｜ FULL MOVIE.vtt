00:00.000 --> 00:13.900
The

00:13.900 --> 00:18.720
world to come will be different from our expectations.

00:18.720 --> 00:25.460
The arc of human history informs the trajectory of our future.

00:25.460 --> 00:33.740
We need to know who we are and how we got here, the ecology, biology, and physics.

00:33.740 --> 00:40.300
To know which paths remain open to us and which lead to dead ends.

00:40.300 --> 00:46.220
Four and a half billion years ago, stardust coalesced to form a planet.

00:46.220 --> 00:51.220
A billion years later, simple life emerged.

00:51.220 --> 00:59.460
By 500 million years ago, a profusion of life had exploded on our blue-green planet.

00:59.460 --> 01:05.140
Fast forward to 66 million years ago, and dinosaurs were taken out by our planet's

01:05.140 --> 01:10.980
most recent mass extinction.

01:10.980 --> 01:16.980
And small shrew-like survivors continued an evolutionary line that would eventually

01:16.980 --> 01:20.540
become us.

01:20.540 --> 01:28.860
Of all our hominid ancestors, one species would ultimately remain homo sapiens, a creature

01:28.860 --> 01:40.300
variously curious, creative, kind, cruel, cooperative, competitive, combative, and clever.

01:40.300 --> 01:46.540
When Earth's climate warmed and stabilized around 10,000 years ago, homo sapiens tribes

01:46.540 --> 01:55.540
who pivoted en masse to agriculture and pastoralism out-reproduced their hunter-gatherer cousins.

01:55.540 --> 02:02.660
Unbeknownst to them and to most of us, this was a planet-changing event.

02:02.660 --> 02:08.060
Sustained by new agricultural surplus, these early humans slowly spread out around the

02:08.060 --> 02:13.900
globe, expanding trade and technology.

02:13.900 --> 02:19.460
For thousands of years, the average annual growth in the size of the human economy would

02:19.460 --> 02:24.580
be unnoticeable from one generation to the next.

02:24.580 --> 02:31.380
By the 16th century, however, more complex social organization and advanced navigational

02:31.380 --> 02:37.620
technology kick-started a unique period in human history.

02:37.700 --> 02:44.300
Yet even with these advances, human cultures remained powered by biomass in the muscles

02:44.300 --> 02:49.700
of humans and our draft animals, limiting growth.

02:49.700 --> 02:56.940
Until in the early 19th century, 10,000 years after the agricultural revolution, humans

02:56.940 --> 03:03.420
discovered how to extract fossil energy and materials from under-Earth's surface to

03:03.420 --> 03:06.740
boost their economies.

03:06.740 --> 03:14.460
This new discovery of geologically stored sunlight in the form of coal, oil and gas

03:14.460 --> 03:18.180
changed everything.

03:18.180 --> 03:23.460
For the first time, human and animal labor played second fiddle to the power of these

03:23.460 --> 03:27.180
new energy sources.

03:27.180 --> 03:33.180
When combined with a machine, a gallon of gasoline could output the same work in a few

03:33.180 --> 03:38.500
minutes as a person laboring for an entire month.

03:38.500 --> 03:47.060
We increasingly replaced manual human tasks with machines at a tiny fraction of the cost.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.740
The result?

03:48.740 --> 03:54.540
Higher profits, higher wages and cheaper goods.

03:54.540 --> 04:01.300
Sudden access to this bank account of stored carbon energy turbocharged our populations,

04:01.300 --> 04:08.380
access to good services and technology, and quadrupled our economic growth rate.

04:08.380 --> 04:12.820
Yet humanity's great acceleration was still ahead.

04:12.820 --> 04:18.460
In the latter half of the 20th century, with this new power source and an upgrade from

04:18.460 --> 04:25.300
coal to higher quality liquid oil, the human economy's average growth rate doubled yet

04:25.300 --> 04:26.660
again.

04:26.660 --> 04:34.020
To now over 30 times what it had averaged during the last few thousand years.

04:34.020 --> 04:40.980
Compared to a global labor force of around 5 billion real humans, the machines and work

04:40.980 --> 04:49.020
powered by access to buried carbon energy added the equivalent power of 500 billion

04:49.020 --> 04:52.100
human workers.

04:52.100 --> 04:58.100
Access to these fossil energies and materials brought billions more humans into existence

04:58.100 --> 05:06.740
and brought billions more out of poverty and led to the creation of new myths, institutions

05:06.740 --> 05:10.220
and expectations.

05:10.220 --> 05:17.020
Our ancestors' lives were tightly linked to the natural flows of the earth, the sun,

05:17.020 --> 05:20.020
the rain and the soil.

05:20.020 --> 05:26.860
But during this moonshot of growth and consumption, our fundamental tether to nature was first

05:26.860 --> 05:31.420
neglected and then forgotten.

05:31.420 --> 05:36.620
The main inputs to our economies were now mostly free.

05:36.620 --> 05:43.540
We nearly had to pay for the cost of their extraction, not the cost of their creation,

05:43.540 --> 05:47.420
their true worth, nor their pollution.

05:47.420 --> 05:53.940
To our ancestors, the benefits from carbon energy would have appeared indistinguishable

05:53.940 --> 05:56.780
from magic.

05:56.780 --> 06:04.300
And instead of appreciating this giant one-time windfall, we developed stories that our new

06:04.300 --> 06:11.060
found wealth and progress had emerged purely from human ingenuity.

06:11.060 --> 06:18.740
We had become energy blind.

06:18.740 --> 06:23.980
Energy is and always will be the currency of life.

06:23.980 --> 06:26.700
Animals were the first investors.

06:26.700 --> 06:32.980
Obtaining a larger energy surplus gives an animal a competitive advantage for survival

06:32.980 --> 06:35.420
and reproduction.

06:35.420 --> 06:42.300
This role of surplus energy is a core driver of the natural world and dictates what can

06:42.300 --> 06:44.900
and can't happen.

06:44.900 --> 06:51.260
We rarely think about it or talk about it, but we're all alive during the carbon pulse,

06:51.260 --> 06:56.900
the few hundred years where humans are drawing down earth's energy battery millions of times

06:56.900 --> 07:02.300
faster than it was trickle-charged by daily photosynthesis.

07:02.300 --> 07:09.140
Chemical hydrocarbons at a vast scale have enormously increased the surplus energy available

07:09.140 --> 07:13.340
to human economies.

07:13.340 --> 07:16.980
Pulses, by definition, don't last forever.

07:16.980 --> 07:21.900
High-quality ores and energy deposits are now mostly things of the past.

07:21.900 --> 07:28.140
Plenty remains, but it's of lower quality and both more costly and ecologically destructive

07:28.140 --> 07:30.300
to extract.

07:30.300 --> 07:35.740
In nature, there are countless examples where energy exists, but the effort to obtain it

07:35.740 --> 07:41.300
is so large that the meal is effectively off the menu.

07:41.300 --> 07:48.300
In our lifetimes, society will have to redirect increasing amounts of our energy surplus towards

07:48.300 --> 07:54.660
obtaining the surplus itself, leaving less affordable energy to support many of our current

07:54.660 --> 07:57.900
economic activities.

07:57.900 --> 08:04.660
One day, the energy it will cost to extract energy will be so large it won't make sense

08:04.660 --> 08:09.060
to do so, even though resources remain.

08:09.060 --> 08:15.540
Energy depletion will act as a growing tax on human societies.

08:15.540 --> 08:22.980
In this unprecedented era of large surplus, we have excelled at combining energy and materials

08:22.980 --> 08:27.860
into technology and inventions that improve the human experience.

08:27.860 --> 08:33.660
New technology can allow us to use resources more efficiently or it can transform natural

08:33.660 --> 08:35.740
flows into energy.

08:35.740 --> 08:42.860
But mostly, technology just creates new ways for humans to consume and builds higher future

08:42.860 --> 08:46.460
requirements for energy and materials.

08:46.460 --> 08:50.380
Things that are more complex require more energy.

08:50.380 --> 08:56.500
When we add nodes to a supply chain, each connection requires energy to maintain.

08:56.500 --> 09:03.020
The complexity of our globally interconnected system currently requires the equivalent of

09:03.020 --> 09:12.940
170 billion light bulbs constantly turned on, burning brightly, powered by the carbon pulse.

09:12.940 --> 09:19.620
Even rebuildable technology that harnesses the sun and the wind grows our total consumption

09:19.620 --> 09:25.340
and has not yet reduced the use of carbon energy globally.

09:25.340 --> 09:31.260
Most people believe that money is real wealth, yet everything we spend money on requires

09:31.260 --> 09:38.420
energy to mine, create, deliver, run, maintain, and dispose of.

09:38.420 --> 09:45.220
In this way, money is ultimately a direct claim on energy and resources.

09:45.220 --> 09:51.700
More economic stories assert that with more money, we can create more of anything.

09:51.700 --> 09:55.960
The truth is, we cannot create energy.

09:55.960 --> 10:02.220
We both extract it and burn it faster by using technology and printing money.

10:02.220 --> 10:08.940
Natural capital, particularly energy, is the true foundation of our monetary systems.

10:08.940 --> 10:17.060
As we create more money, we don't create more resources, we merely access them faster.

10:17.060 --> 10:23.620
The highest sustained growth rate of human economies ever before and likely ever again

10:23.620 --> 10:29.460
peaked 50 years ago when oil production growth was at its highest.

10:29.460 --> 10:35.180
But rather than living within our means, we found creative ways to extend growth for a

10:35.180 --> 10:37.420
while longer.

10:37.420 --> 10:43.140
We created complex supply chains, outsourcing the heavy lifting to countries with cheaper

10:43.140 --> 10:44.460
labor.

10:44.460 --> 10:50.420
We turned to debt in a large way to maintain high levels of consumption, a behavior that

10:50.420 --> 10:56.380
accelerated in 2008 and has gone into overdrive since 2020.

10:56.380 --> 11:02.300
Debt allows us to spend resources from the future and call it economic growth.

11:02.300 --> 11:07.780
This phenomenon has become so pervasive in the last 50 years that we think it's normal

11:07.780 --> 11:11.860
to consume today and pay tomorrow.

11:11.860 --> 11:17.460
The developed world is now using debt to enable the extraction of things we couldn't otherwise

11:17.460 --> 11:19.460
afford to extract.

11:19.460 --> 11:24.100
To produce things we otherwise couldn't afford to consume.

11:24.100 --> 11:30.100
This strategy has an expiration date because all this new money will one day be spent on

11:30.100 --> 11:34.940
real things requiring energy.

11:34.940 --> 11:42.660
Enabled by an extraordinary but temporary energy surplus, the human economy is now over

11:42.660 --> 11:48.340
1,000 times bigger than it was just five centuries ago.

11:48.340 --> 11:55.140
Most of the benefits of this one-time geological surplus now flow to a fraction of people,

11:55.140 --> 12:00.700
not to the rest of living humans, nor future generations.

12:00.700 --> 12:06.260
As we extract minerals and burn fossil carbon to support modern living standards, their

12:06.260 --> 12:12.260
waste streams are in turn diminishing the life support systems of other species and

12:12.260 --> 12:14.940
future beings.

12:14.940 --> 12:22.900
The impact of our global energy metabolism on nature has been tragic and is now accelerating,

12:22.900 --> 12:29.060
resulting in, among other things, animal bird and fish populations dropping by 50% since

12:29.060 --> 12:36.300
the 1970s, plastic now weighing more than all animals on land and in the sea, and a

12:36.300 --> 12:44.220
child born today being expected to outlive Earth's coral reefs.

12:44.220 --> 12:52.580
As a culture, we have recently, but almost entirely, financialized the human experience.

12:52.580 --> 12:58.940
Not only have we parsed the rich fabric of human life into a single monetary marker,

12:58.940 --> 13:03.500
but in doing so, we've used the wrong prices.

13:03.500 --> 13:09.780
The price of money is wrong, because we grow it with a keystroke with no tether to finite

13:09.780 --> 13:12.380
natural capital.

13:12.380 --> 13:19.020
The price of energy is wrong, because we don't treat it as the extraordinary, irreplaceable

13:19.020 --> 13:24.860
resource it is, non-renewable on any human timescale.

13:24.860 --> 13:31.140
And in setting prices on everything, we've lost sight of the large cost their use has

13:31.140 --> 13:34.220
on Earth's ecosystems.

13:34.220 --> 13:41.500
This biophysical story is all connected in an emergent and unexpected way.

13:41.500 --> 13:48.700
As the carbon pulse boosted our economies, our institutions and governments self-organized

13:48.700 --> 13:52.140
around expectations of growth.

13:52.140 --> 14:00.140
Now, 8 billion members of a social species collectively seek profits, which are linked

14:00.140 --> 14:05.620
to energy, which is linked to fossil hydrocarbons and minerals.

14:05.620 --> 14:12.940
Growth, as measured by increases in GDP, is now required for stability.

14:12.940 --> 14:19.220
We have arrived at a place where we as a culture have outsourced our decisions and

14:19.220 --> 14:22.580
planning to the financial system.

14:22.580 --> 14:31.620
The market's compulsion to grow now outcompetes any alternative paths of wisdom or constraint.

14:31.620 --> 14:36.340
The system is no longer in anyone's control.

14:36.340 --> 14:45.300
The human species, at least to this point, has become a mindless, insatiable, energy-hungry

14:45.300 --> 14:51.300
superorganism.

14:51.300 --> 14:59.820
The superorganism is an emergent phenomenon of the animals that comprise it, us.

14:59.820 --> 15:04.500
Human beings are related to all other creatures on Earth.

15:04.500 --> 15:11.220
We are the product of an unbroken chain connecting to the first life, which means that hidden

15:11.220 --> 15:17.260
beneath our stated motivations of what we do every day in industrial society, we are

15:17.260 --> 15:23.740
driven to pursue the same neurochemical brain rewards our ancestors pursued.

15:23.740 --> 15:30.900
This has huge implications for our behaviors, our economies and our futures.

15:30.900 --> 15:35.500
Reaching for our phone to see if someone liked our Facebook post or to see if Bitcoin

15:35.500 --> 15:39.380
is up or down, aren't really our goals.

15:39.380 --> 15:46.220
We are in reality just seeking the same brain rewards that led to success for our hunter-gatherer

15:46.220 --> 15:48.220
ancestors.

15:48.220 --> 15:56.180
Dopamine is a molecule that in animals and in humans leads to motivation and action.

15:56.180 --> 16:03.780
In a materially rich modern world, the habituation to the action of consumption leads to the

16:03.780 --> 16:11.780
wanting of things, culture-wide, being stronger than the reward we get from having them.

16:11.780 --> 16:17.540
This is a fundamental problem for an economic system that's turning billions of barrels

16:17.540 --> 16:23.940
of oil into microliters of dopamine.

16:23.940 --> 16:31.500
As a carryover from ancestral tribal life, we are highly tuned to social signals, comparing

16:31.500 --> 16:37.660
ourselves to others seeking approval, acceptance and jockeying for status.

16:37.660 --> 16:44.740
With material and now digital wealth as today's primary status signal, consumerism is now

16:44.740 --> 16:52.260
largely based on having as much or more than those around us, rather than focusing on what

16:52.340 --> 16:57.580
we may actually need.

16:57.580 --> 17:00.580
Modern humans are still tribal beings.

17:00.580 --> 17:06.420
We staunchly support those in our in-groups and easily ostracize out-groups, from trivial

17:06.420 --> 17:13.260
divisions like sports teams to political affiliation, race or nationality.

17:13.260 --> 17:20.020
Our evolution has primed us to blame other humans for situations we don't like or understand.

17:22.900 --> 17:32.020
We have rich, creative and colorful imaginations that reside in the virtual worlds of our minds.

17:32.020 --> 17:40.100
The human brain can imagine and verbalize limitless combinations of physical impossibilities,

17:40.100 --> 17:46.900
sustainable outposts on Mars, self-perpetuating energy machines, and an economy based on

17:46.900 --> 17:53.780
physical consumption growing continually for centuries.

17:53.780 --> 18:00.940
In ancestral times, these virtual worlds overlapped with the physical worlds we inhabited, making

18:00.940 --> 18:04.780
us more content and effective as a tribal unit.

18:04.780 --> 18:12.140
But in a culture of vast material wealth, information overload and social media, it's

18:12.140 --> 18:18.580
increasingly difficult for us to separate fantasy from reality.

18:18.580 --> 18:25.500
When these individual virtual worlds connect with the virtual worlds of others, the result

18:25.500 --> 18:32.580
is widespread shared beliefs that money is real, that our current wealth is due mostly

18:32.580 --> 18:41.220
to our cleverness, and that technology will lead to limitless growth.

18:41.220 --> 18:47.180
When we look to others to try and understand our complex modern world, as social beings

18:47.180 --> 18:54.780
who said it, becomes more important than logic or the quality of the evidence, celebrity

18:54.780 --> 19:01.460
and group affiliation now matter more than truth.

19:01.460 --> 19:07.220
Our stone age brains are no match for the social media algorithms that now constantly

19:07.220 --> 19:10.060
hijack our attention.

19:10.060 --> 19:16.620
Modern media outlets prey on our evolutionary inclinations for novelty and in-group defense,

19:16.620 --> 19:24.780
via capturing our attention and turning clicks and shares into consumption.

19:24.780 --> 19:31.020
Computer algorithms optimized for profit are splintering our society by reducing attention

19:31.020 --> 19:39.220
spans, accelerating addiction, polarization, apathy, and mistrust in science.

19:39.220 --> 19:47.140
A metaphorical technology worm driven by exponentially improving artificial intelligence

19:47.140 --> 19:53.500
is silently eating our minds.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.780
Humans are creatures with finite lifespans.

19:56.780 --> 20:00.380
The future is not a priority to us emotionally.

20:00.380 --> 20:07.460
Instead, we are focused on the very short term, this weekend's plans, this quarter's

20:07.460 --> 20:08.460
earnings.

20:08.460 --> 20:14.740
In this term's election, the next set of compelling images were urged to scroll to.

20:14.740 --> 20:22.780
We often promise to make big changes starting tomorrow, until tomorrow becomes today, and

20:22.780 --> 20:29.420
the cycle repeats delaying any actual change.

20:29.420 --> 20:36.900
Like other biological organisms, humans seek gains and are averse to losses.

20:36.900 --> 20:43.340
We look for undervalued stocks to invest in, sales on new shoes, or two-for-one cocktails

20:43.340 --> 20:44.980
at happy hour.

20:44.980 --> 20:51.260
Unlike squirrels or cheetahs, we are an extremely social species.

20:51.260 --> 20:59.700
We coordinate as families, small businesses, corporations, and nation states to maximize

20:59.700 --> 21:07.300
our virtual surplus, dollars, which we then spend on real things.

21:07.300 --> 21:16.020
Our core economic and environmental challenges stem from a mismatch of hunter-gatherer minds

21:16.020 --> 21:20.740
inhabiting a competitive consumer growth culture.

21:20.740 --> 21:28.980
Together, these human universals have led to incentives and behaviors which have created

21:28.980 --> 21:36.620
a metabolic superorganism whose objective is disconnected from the well-being of its

21:36.620 --> 21:41.180
parts, us.

21:41.180 --> 21:49.260
It is tempting to look at how we live today and conclude that this is how humans are.

21:49.260 --> 21:55.700
But modern society is only a single brief example out of thousands of successful arrangements

21:55.700 --> 21:57.860
in human history.

21:57.860 --> 22:03.100
Humans alive today don't choose to be hierarchical or greedy.

22:03.100 --> 22:11.380
Many of our choices are constrained by the economic system we were born into.

22:11.380 --> 22:17.700
Our current high consumption, high inequality, high technological distraction, and low levels

22:17.700 --> 22:26.180
of daily human connection are a direct product of the carbon pulse.

22:26.180 --> 22:32.420
Though human brains don't change quickly under the right circumstances, our behaviors

22:32.420 --> 22:36.300
and cultural norms can move at lightning speed.

22:36.300 --> 22:42.420
Our species is incredibly adaptive when we're challenged.

22:42.420 --> 22:49.700
The way we've been living is an anomaly, but we take it for granted because as individuals,

22:49.700 --> 22:53.540
it's all we've ever known.

22:53.540 --> 23:00.900
Going forward, a lifestyle adapted to lower energy use will reconnect our virtual and

23:00.900 --> 23:02.780
physical worlds.

23:02.780 --> 23:10.340
By necessity, our lives will become less global, more interpersonally engaged, and more tethered

23:10.340 --> 23:15.940
to natural flows.

23:15.940 --> 23:21.500
As a species, a global superorganism is not our destiny.

23:21.500 --> 23:25.260
Who we are has brought us to this precipice.

23:25.260 --> 23:32.660
Who we are capable of becoming as individuals and as a society will be the question of our

23:32.660 --> 23:37.020
time.

23:37.020 --> 23:43.340
We are alive at a time of wonder, peril, and possibility.

23:43.340 --> 23:49.500
Ahead are a million unknown destinations, some dark and foreboding, and some welcoming

23:49.500 --> 23:51.580
and beautiful.

23:51.580 --> 23:58.180
Many of us sense that something is different, something is coming, but we lack a shared

23:58.180 --> 24:04.780
understanding of the path that brought us here and of the terrain ahead.

24:04.780 --> 24:11.660
Each future we expect depends upon which lens we use to see the road.

24:11.660 --> 24:18.980
Modern society is polarized, stressed, and overwhelmed with information, good and bad.

24:18.980 --> 24:26.260
As a result, common points of view are lenses, focused on the road just in front of us.

24:26.260 --> 24:32.140
For the view to the future, we defer to culturally accepted guides who are confident they know

24:32.140 --> 24:35.220
the way forward.

24:35.220 --> 24:40.860
Through the lens of an economist, for example, we see a glorious road leading to growth that

24:40.860 --> 24:42.700
never stops.

24:42.700 --> 24:49.620
Any scarcity of energy or material inputs will be solved by price signals, creating incentives

24:49.620 --> 24:53.140
which increase our productivity and growth.

24:53.140 --> 25:01.900
The economic lens shows us that human ingenuity and the market will solve everything.

25:01.900 --> 25:09.260
A financial lens translates stock markets at all time highs as a sign of society's health,

25:09.260 --> 25:12.740
pretending a rich and virtuous future.

25:12.740 --> 25:19.420
With enough financial capital, we'll be able to build roads to anywhere.

25:19.420 --> 25:26.060
A technology lens promises a shiny road of comfort, novelty, and prosperity, enabled

25:26.060 --> 25:28.260
by future inventions.

25:28.260 --> 25:34.220
Innovation, artificial intelligence, and a vibrant metaverse will sidestep any energy

25:34.220 --> 25:36.580
or resource constraints.

25:36.580 --> 25:42.260
We envision future humans breaking free from the confines of Earth and enjoying high-tech

25:42.260 --> 25:47.580
lifestyles where the biggest problem is runaway robots.

25:47.580 --> 25:52.380
These lenses are all optimistic, but misguided.

25:52.380 --> 25:56.220
All these lenses are energy blind.

25:56.220 --> 26:03.220
The real paths ahead can only be seen by integrating energy awareness with biology,

26:03.220 --> 26:08.060
sociology, physics, and everything science has discovered.

26:08.060 --> 26:11.980
We need a systems lens to read the map.

26:11.980 --> 26:19.100
A systems lens reveals the holistic story that explains humanity's path.

26:19.100 --> 26:25.740
In pursuit of the same emotional experiences of our ancient ancestors, we transform materials

26:25.740 --> 26:31.780
and energy into technologies that make our lives more comfortable and fun.

26:31.780 --> 26:37.980
We keep score of our progress using money, which has become a psychological stand-in

26:37.980 --> 26:41.460
for all the things our ancestors valued.

26:41.460 --> 26:48.660
The massive scale of humanity's consumption is evidenced by the excess CO2 being absorbed

26:48.660 --> 26:52.020
by Earth's oceans and atmosphere.

26:52.020 --> 27:00.700
The emergent result is a metabolic superorganism, with oil as its hemoglobin transporting goods

27:00.700 --> 27:05.300
through the arteries and veins of a global supply network.

27:05.300 --> 27:11.660
Like a shark needing to swim to get oxygen flowing through its gills, our current economic

27:11.660 --> 27:18.540
system has an imperative to grow in order to satisfy prior financial commitments.

27:18.540 --> 27:24.260
We can't stop, nor can we slow down, or the system will crash.

27:24.260 --> 27:30.700
A systems lens reveals that the road ahead is closed to our current cultural expectations,

27:30.700 --> 27:34.300
yet we continue to bear down on the accelerator.

27:34.300 --> 27:42.460
Wearing systems lenses removes the blind spots created by any single issue lens.

27:42.460 --> 27:47.660
Global economic growth will never meaningfully decouple from energy consumption.

27:47.660 --> 27:55.620
It cannot, because the world's GDP, by definition, has always been a proxy for how much energy

27:55.620 --> 27:57.180
we burn.

27:57.180 --> 28:03.420
If we were to grow the global economy at 3% a year, as most governments and institutions

28:03.420 --> 28:11.100
expect, we would use as much energy and materials in the next 30 years as we have in the past

28:11.100 --> 28:14.540
10,000.

28:14.540 --> 28:20.620
Stock markets are poor guideposts for prosperity when inflated by government and central bank

28:20.620 --> 28:22.120
support.

28:22.120 --> 28:28.860
All the cash, stocks, bonds, and pension funds in the world will need energy and materials

28:28.860 --> 28:33.340
to be cashed out and turned into real wealth.

28:33.340 --> 28:39.980
Creativity and innovation will be central to human futures, but modern technology requires

28:39.980 --> 28:44.860
huge amounts of energy to build and to operate.

28:44.860 --> 28:53.900
As long as GDP is our goal, efficiency gains from new technology will serve the superorganism.

28:53.900 --> 29:00.260
Transitioning from fossil hydrocarbon to rebuildable energy won't change this dynamic.

29:00.260 --> 29:08.620
Ultimately, in addition to using different energy, we'll need to use energy differently.

29:08.620 --> 29:13.820
Bringing our future through a systems lens changes everything.

29:13.820 --> 29:20.460
We have spent the last century harnessing enormous amounts of fossil energy to build

29:20.460 --> 29:25.180
a world of complexity like nothing seen before.

29:25.180 --> 29:33.020
In the coming century, humanity will experience a great simplification.

29:33.020 --> 29:40.260
There will always be energy on earth as long as the sun burns, but the amount of surplus

29:40.260 --> 29:45.420
energy available to human societies will soon be diminished.

29:45.420 --> 29:51.040
As the extraction of geologically stored energy becomes more difficult, everything we're

29:51.040 --> 29:56.580
used to in society will become more costly or less available.

29:56.580 --> 30:01.220
We are not planning for this because it's never happened before.

30:01.220 --> 30:07.180
The onset of the great simplification will be financial and economic turbulence followed

30:07.180 --> 30:08.940
by contraction.

30:08.940 --> 30:14.980
When we can no longer grow fast enough to maintain all the increased financial claims,

30:14.980 --> 30:21.340
economies will recede to a scale that can again be supported by physical flows without

30:21.340 --> 30:23.260
credit.

30:23.260 --> 30:28.860
Complex global supply chains, the related high consumption lifestyles, and many of

30:28.860 --> 30:34.660
the conveniences and freedoms we take for granted in this era of abundant energy surplus

30:34.660 --> 30:36.860
will diminish.

30:36.860 --> 30:43.060
The ensuing simplification will be among the most significant events ever experienced

30:43.060 --> 30:45.620
by our species.

30:45.620 --> 30:52.260
Those who look through a systems lens can serve as early visionaries of a simpler life with

30:52.260 --> 31:00.620
new ways of relating to technology, to consumption, to each other, and to earth's ecosystems.

31:00.620 --> 31:05.740
There are many pathways wending through a great simplification.

31:05.740 --> 31:11.060
Some are wise, humane, and even preferable to what we have now.

31:11.060 --> 31:18.940
Some are so dark as to be nearly unthinkable, yet it is precisely thinking about these pathways

31:18.940 --> 31:26.140
and actively choosing among them, which offers the only realistic hope for a long and meaningful

31:26.140 --> 31:28.420
human future.

31:28.420 --> 31:35.060
Nature has gifted us with a productive and beautiful home, the ability to understand

31:35.060 --> 31:42.020
how we got here, and the creativity to imagine which paths are possible.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.500
The future need not be dystopian.

31:45.540 --> 31:51.420
But cleverness alone will no longer suffice for the next leg of our journey.

31:51.420 --> 32:00.380
We will need imagination, foresight, empathy, and above all, wisdom to navigate the path

32:00.380 --> 32:03.540
to the future that is arriving.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.300
The great simplification.
