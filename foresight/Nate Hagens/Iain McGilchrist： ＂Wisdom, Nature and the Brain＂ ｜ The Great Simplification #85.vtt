00:00.000 --> 00:08.160
I would like to warmly welcome my next guest, Ian McGilchrist. Ian is a psychiatrist,

00:08.880 --> 00:16.000
a neuroscience researcher, an author, a philosopher, a literary scholar. He is an

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
associate, a fellow of the Green Templeton College, Oxford, a fellow of the Royal College

00:22.000 --> 00:28.400
of Psychiatrists, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a consultant emeritus of the Bethlehem

00:28.400 --> 00:35.760
and Maudsley Hospital in London. Professor McGilchrist came into prominence with the publication of

00:35.760 --> 00:42.960
his tome, The Master and His Emissary, The Divided Brain, and The Making of the Western World,

00:44.160 --> 00:50.320
which is how I came to be exposed to his work. And then 14 years later, his most recent book

00:50.320 --> 00:56.880
titled The Matter with Things, Our Brains, Our Delusions, and The Unmaking of the World.

00:57.840 --> 01:06.320
This was one of those conversations that was both profound, wise, and intimate. I had never

01:06.320 --> 01:12.880
met or spoken with Ian before the camera was turned on, and I learned continually during this

01:12.880 --> 01:20.960
podcast, and I immediately felt a kinship with this man who deeply cares about the state of the

01:20.960 --> 01:28.400
world and has spent a lifetime researching what I think is the most important aspect of our situation,

01:28.400 --> 01:35.680
which is the human brain and our disconnect from the types of experience and perspectives of our

01:35.680 --> 01:42.880
ancestors. I hope you enjoy this episode as much as I did. Please welcome Dr. Ian McGilchrist.

01:51.440 --> 02:01.280
Dr. Ian McGilchrist, good to meet you, sir. Very good to be with you, Nate. Thank you for asking me along.

02:03.840 --> 02:09.360
I've been making it a habit when I say hello to people in other countries that I greet them in

02:09.360 --> 02:14.480
their language, but since you're in Scotland, I didn't know if I should just start swearing or

02:14.560 --> 02:24.160
how to greet someone in Scottish. Any kind of suitable animal noise that suggests some

02:24.160 --> 02:34.160
appreciation will do. Let me bring you up to speed here. Some things you might not know.

02:35.600 --> 02:43.120
20 years ago, I started my PhD. I left Wall Street because I could see how the pieces were

02:43.120 --> 02:48.240
starting to connect and that humans were having a real problem with climate change, the environment,

02:49.440 --> 02:56.880
resources, et cetera. I started my PhD with a British psychiatrist on my advisory committee

02:56.880 --> 03:03.520
by the name of Dr. Peter Weibrow. We were going to look at why we don't so much face

03:04.320 --> 03:10.320
an environmental problem or a resource problem, but a mismatch of the human brain with our current

03:10.320 --> 03:18.960
situation. Then I ended up diving into energy and I left that aside, but reading your books and,

03:18.960 --> 03:24.160
to be honest, I've had them for two months and I've not made my way through them. I called Daniel

03:24.160 --> 03:29.520
Schmacktenberger and said, I'm interviewing Ian McGillchrist next week. Could you leave me some

03:29.520 --> 03:36.640
pointers? He left me a 19-minute boxer that I would need a librarian to translate, but it seems

03:36.720 --> 03:47.840
that all along you have been talking about the same thing, which is that our brains are driving

03:49.040 --> 03:55.200
much of what's going on. I don't want to rehash what you've done on lots of other excellent

03:55.200 --> 04:01.360
podcasts and videos and you sent me that animated video, which I think is great. I want to apply it

04:01.360 --> 04:07.440
to this superorganism environmental dynamic, but for those people who are not familiar with your

04:07.440 --> 04:15.840
work, could you give kind of an elevator pitch but a longish one on the core points in your two

04:15.840 --> 04:22.080
main books, The Master and his Emissary and The Matter With Things, if you would?

04:22.960 --> 04:29.200
Yes, I can do that. I think the first thing that I would point out is I don't believe that the brain

04:29.200 --> 04:36.080
is driving these things in some sort of way. I believe that there are many causes of the crisis

04:36.080 --> 04:43.280
that we're in now, some of them economic, some of them political, some of them sociological and it

04:43.280 --> 04:50.000
has many aspects. So I'm not saying it's the brain that causes the crisis we're in, but the brain

04:50.960 --> 04:56.000
has become hijacked in a way by the way we're thinking now and that that's important for us

04:56.080 --> 05:05.040
to realise. So in those books, essentially they start from a few interesting questions which puzzle

05:05.040 --> 05:11.200
me a lot and we're not talked about in my medical training. Why is the brain divided at all? If it's

05:11.200 --> 05:17.520
this supercomputer, why waste computing power by dividing it into two chunks in this way?

05:19.120 --> 05:24.640
I don't believe it is a computer by the way. I can tell you a half a dozen reasons why it's not

05:24.640 --> 05:33.120
like a computer, but nonetheless, why is it divided? Why is it asymmetrical? And why for most of the

05:33.120 --> 05:40.000
history of the brain has there been no band of fibres connecting them? It was a mammalian invention,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.920
the corpus callosum, it's called the body of fibres at the base of the brain that connects the

05:43.920 --> 05:50.800
two hemispheres. But the divided brain goes back millions of years, hundreds of millions of years

05:50.800 --> 05:55.040
and the asymmetry of the brain goes back to the very earliest neural networks. Why?

05:56.240 --> 06:04.560
And the answer to this is simple in a way, at least I think and nobody's suggested anything that goes

06:04.560 --> 06:11.200
near it and explaining why we have this arrangement and nobody suggested I'm wrong to say this.

06:12.480 --> 06:20.480
It stems from a Darwinian problem of survival. How do you pay narrow attention to something

06:20.480 --> 06:25.520
that you need to manipulate to something you need to pick up if you're a bird get that seed

06:25.520 --> 06:32.320
quickly, if you're a predator to catch your prey, if you want to pick up sticks or fashion tools,

06:32.320 --> 06:38.880
you've got to have this very manipulative cast of mind in which you're going to target that

06:38.880 --> 06:45.840
whatever it is that you know is important to you in detail. And that requires a very focused

06:45.920 --> 06:52.480
narrow beam attention. If that's the only kind of attention you pay, then you will end up being

06:52.480 --> 06:56.720
someone else's lunch while you're getting your own because you need to be on the lookout for

06:56.720 --> 07:03.040
predators. You need to be on the lookout for your conspecifics, for your mate, for your offspring

07:03.040 --> 07:08.960
that also need to be protected and fed. So the only way in which you can pay these two kinds of

07:08.960 --> 07:16.640
attention at once is to have two neuronal masses each capable of disposing a kind of attention to

07:16.640 --> 07:25.200
the world. One narrow targeted piecemeal, the other uncommitted, broad, sustained and vigilant.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.560
Now that may not sound like a big deal, but the fact that there's a different way of attending

07:30.560 --> 07:37.200
changes everything because how you attend governs what you find. And so effectively these two ways

07:37.200 --> 07:45.600
of attending to the world build completely different images takes whatever you like to call

07:45.600 --> 07:51.600
them of the world in our minds. I hesitate over image because it makes it sound it's just visual,

07:51.600 --> 07:57.600
but I mean in every modality. And what are those differences? Well, there are about a dozen of

07:57.600 --> 08:04.640
them that are isolable. But let me just say this, in the left hemisphere the world seems to be made

08:04.640 --> 08:11.840
up of little bits that have no context, no meaning, they're isolated, atomistic, and if they have any

08:11.840 --> 08:17.200
meaning at all it's because we put them together in some way for some purpose of our own. They're

08:17.200 --> 08:28.160
abstracted from their embodied nature, from their physical context, relatively devoid of any kind

08:28.160 --> 08:35.520
of meaning including emotional, spiritual meaning. And what you have there is a pretty much an

08:35.520 --> 08:41.840
inanimate and mechanical world, a dead world. The right hemisphere on the other hand sees

08:41.840 --> 08:47.680
the broad picture and it sees that everything is ultimately connected with everything else.

08:47.680 --> 08:53.520
That unlike these fixed frames of the left hemisphere everything can be seen to be in

08:53.520 --> 09:00.640
constant movement, nothing ever stops moving in the entire universe. It sees that everything is

09:00.640 --> 09:05.440
what it is only in the context that it's in. So once you've isolated it you've lost most of its

09:05.440 --> 09:13.920
meaning. It sees that, for example, the animals and the people that we see around us are embodied

09:13.920 --> 09:20.640
and that's a very important part of their nature. It sees that the inner life, it sees what is

09:20.720 --> 09:26.160
implicit whereas the left hemisphere sees only the explicit. As a result the left hemisphere

09:26.160 --> 09:33.840
doesn't understand things like tone of voice, facial expressions, bodily gestures, puns,

09:34.800 --> 09:43.200
metaphors, myths, narratives, rites, rituals, anything that isn't just the kind of thing you

09:43.200 --> 09:49.200
could teach a machine by putting in a word box and a kind of syntax box it doesn't really get.

09:50.000 --> 09:56.960
And it's also super confident that it's right. In fact because it knows so very little it thinks

09:56.960 --> 10:02.400
it knows everything. There's something in psychology I'm sure you know called the Dunning-Kruger effect

10:02.400 --> 10:07.120
which dictates that the less you know the more you think you know and the right hemisphere however

10:07.120 --> 10:14.880
sees a great deal and has arranged things so that it can farm out the mere procedural work to the

10:14.880 --> 10:20.160
left hemisphere so that it doesn't get distracted from its job of seeing the overall picture.

10:20.160 --> 10:28.320
So these two work very well in harmony as long as the left hemisphere observes its role as an

10:28.320 --> 10:33.680
adjunct to the right hemisphere. It sees less but it can do certain things very quickly in the way

10:33.680 --> 10:38.960
that a PC can. I mean the PC doesn't know what you know you put data in it doesn't understand them

10:38.960 --> 10:44.240
it spews stuff out it doesn't understand it you do the understanding the PC just does it quickly

10:44.240 --> 10:49.760
and the left hemisphere is like as I say I resist the idea that the brain is a computer but just

10:49.760 --> 10:55.360
for this purpose of this metaphor the left hemisphere is like the personal PC of the right

10:55.360 --> 11:01.760
hemisphere that is the one that we can trust because it's more in touch with reality in every respect.

11:02.480 --> 11:09.200
And so in I expound that to begin with in the master and his emissary and I do it at greater

11:09.200 --> 11:16.560
length in the first part of the matter with things. In the second part of the master and his emissary I

11:16.560 --> 11:25.040
say how has this changed if it has changed over the course of western civilization because I see

11:25.040 --> 11:31.440
that around us we seem to be very much living in a world of the kind that the left hemisphere sees

11:31.440 --> 11:38.560
unsophisticated untempered by what the right hemisphere could teach us. So has it always been

11:38.560 --> 11:44.560
like this and my answer to that is no over the history of the west there have been three points

11:44.560 --> 11:50.400
at which civilization seemed to embody the best of the two working together fruitfully.

11:50.400 --> 11:57.280
And I'd say these moments are around the sixth century BC in ancient Greece around the year

11:57.280 --> 12:05.840
dot in Rome and around the 1415 century the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe.

12:06.560 --> 12:12.400
And at those moments we see something flourishing in the arts in the sciences everywhere because

12:12.400 --> 12:18.240
these hemispheres are feeding one another but in every case after a period of time

12:18.240 --> 12:23.520
things seem to fossilize they become more mechanical more hierarchical more stereotype more

12:23.520 --> 12:30.000
bureaucratic more legalistic and the imaginative part that helps us see and understand the world

12:30.000 --> 12:36.400
we live in begins to erode and the civilization collapses it collapsed in Greece it collapsed in

12:36.400 --> 12:44.240
Rome and it's collapsing for us now I believe. In the matter with things I do a little bit more

12:45.120 --> 12:51.200
and I look more at the philosophical implications of this so I look at the way what neurology can

12:51.200 --> 12:57.040
teach us about the hemispheres what philosophy can teach us about the hemispheres and what physics

12:57.040 --> 13:04.080
can tell us about the world that we live in and I find that these three parts lead from different

13:04.080 --> 13:10.160
very different starting points to the same picture of the world which is very close to the one the

13:10.160 --> 13:15.440
right hemisphere has of something that is never fixed and certain that is always evolving that

13:15.440 --> 13:22.800
is in process that is complex beautiful rich interconnected animate rather than the dead

13:22.800 --> 13:28.320
world of mechanistic reductionism so that's it in a nutshell there's a lot more to say but you

13:28.320 --> 13:35.520
can ask me if you're interested. I am interested and I've got like 14 prepared questions for you

13:35.520 --> 13:40.960
and I think I'm just going to scrap those and ask you whatever comes to my mind because I have a

13:40.960 --> 13:54.320
ton of questions so the left brain puts the bits together and creates a narrative that suits us

13:54.320 --> 14:01.840
right so it uses the left brain in kind of a internal authority bias sort of way and dominates

14:01.840 --> 14:08.320
the narrative which could explain why there's so many people that are cocksure that they understand

14:08.320 --> 14:15.920
the world and trump is right or biden is right or you know climate change is a hoax or we're all

14:15.920 --> 14:24.720
going extinct that it gives people like a overly self-confident because it helps themselves in

14:24.720 --> 14:31.360
their own fitness. I think the left hemisphere envisages only the sort of thing it can know

14:32.320 --> 14:38.880
and it knows how to put things together and make something and so it decides that the world must

14:38.880 --> 14:44.880
be made like that from little bit and in doing so it completely misunderstands its nature and it

14:44.880 --> 14:53.040
produces that kind of cocksure certainty which is surely the sign of a lack of wisdom one of the

14:53.040 --> 14:58.800
signs of wisdom is that one feels less certain that one knows rather than more certain that one

14:58.800 --> 15:06.240
knows in general so yeah I do think that yeah. Did you ever have a chance to watch uh we were

15:06.240 --> 15:11.600
emailing a couple months back the the latest episode with Daniel Schmockenberger and I on

15:11.600 --> 15:18.240
artificial intelligence where we really it was only a little bit on AI it was mostly about how

15:18.240 --> 15:27.360
humans have had narrow boundary criteria nation states economic systems have outcompeted

15:28.000 --> 15:34.960
wide boundary more wisdom types of systems. Did you ever listen to that and what do you think

15:34.960 --> 15:41.360
about that? Intelligence versus wisdom is a little bit of a narrow boundary goal versus a wide

15:41.360 --> 15:48.960
boundary goal. I did listen to part of it but I didn't listen to all of it and I'm very interested

15:48.960 --> 15:56.320
in Daniel's work and he and I are going to do a couple of things together but what I'd say about

15:56.320 --> 16:04.160
that is that first of all human beings are not just the squalid competitive apes that we are

16:04.160 --> 16:10.800
made out to be we have many many interesting traits we are social animals we know how to

16:10.800 --> 16:17.120
sacrifice for another and indeed the history of evolution is as much a history of cooperation

16:17.120 --> 16:22.240
as it is of competition competition is very important of course but the cooperation has

16:22.240 --> 16:28.560
been neglected and we do know how to cooperate and when we're working well both the hemisphere

16:28.560 --> 16:33.840
cooperate with one another and we cooperate with one another so the history I mean the

16:33.840 --> 16:38.240
history of the west is the one that I know best I haven't attempted to write about the history of

16:38.240 --> 16:44.000
the east though I suspect it will tell a different story until very recently when it seems to become

16:44.000 --> 16:49.280
occidentalized in the most lamentable way taking all our worst sins upon it but anyway

16:49.840 --> 17:00.000
and yeah I mean I think that is right wisdom is always going to be relatively rare and involves

17:00.000 --> 17:07.040
a lot of things it involves the putting together of a life well lived and the experience that comes

17:07.040 --> 17:15.440
from that with an understanding of history a sense of the spiritual and an ability to aggregate

17:16.080 --> 17:24.960
information but at the moment I'd say that information is triumphant over a true understanding

17:26.000 --> 17:32.800
and an understanding is what intelligence requires and means so that much of the time

17:32.800 --> 17:38.800
we're amassing information and we kind of know in a technical way certain things we probably know

17:38.800 --> 17:44.640
more in that sense than than humanity has ever known but we're also in my view less wise than

17:44.640 --> 17:50.960
humanity has ever been this fact that we can know things and can do things has gone to our heads

17:50.960 --> 17:58.800
and made us hubristic vain and ridiculous because we think we can solve everything but we don't

17:58.800 --> 18:04.640
understand a half of what we've got hold of here so I think AI is a problem yeah so how

18:04.640 --> 18:11.600
how does that map from an individual to a culture because as individuals we have left

18:11.600 --> 18:15.840
hemispheres and right hemispheres and we have a corpus callosum that divides them

18:16.400 --> 18:23.760
and is getting larger over time implying that there's some narrative control going on

18:24.320 --> 18:29.440
but our culture doesn't have a left or a right hemisphere so is it just the proportion of the

18:29.440 --> 18:35.920
population that is kind of tilted in one direction that periodically you said there were a couple

18:36.000 --> 18:40.640
historical cultures that flourished because they had more of a balanced

18:42.240 --> 18:47.040
what's the difference between individuals population and the whole culture with respect

18:47.040 --> 18:54.560
to this phenomenon yes it's a reasonable question and of course I'm not suggesting that

18:54.560 --> 19:00.640
physically the brain has changed enormously since 2000 years ago it will have changed a bit

19:00.640 --> 19:05.920
because it's always involving but it's not that I'm referring to and it's that we use the brain

19:05.920 --> 19:11.280
in in different ways we can choose to listen to one part of the brain more than another

19:11.280 --> 19:19.120
and I think that what happens it as a society becomes a powerful civilization a number of

19:19.120 --> 19:25.920
things happen one is that it over reaches itself either in terms of its territory or its military

19:25.920 --> 19:34.560
and economic power and in doing that it needs to be able to control or thinks it needs to be able

19:34.560 --> 19:48.000
to control a vast ever vast panoply of of elements in human life and to do that it needs to simplify

19:48.080 --> 19:56.240
to roll out as we say a bureaucratic system and so forth so as a civilization becomes too large

19:56.240 --> 20:01.600
and over reaches itself it moves more and more towards a kind of left hemisphere thinking

20:01.600 --> 20:06.960
that helps it with the map the theory the diagram of life rather than the actual business of life

20:07.680 --> 20:11.120
and I think the other thing that happens well there are many things that happened I think

20:11.120 --> 20:15.680
there are about half a dozen that I refer to in the preface to the matter with things

20:16.240 --> 20:22.640
um sorry the preface to the martian is emissary and take much further in the matter with things

20:22.640 --> 20:30.960
but one is something that the great philosopher A. N. Whitehead said that a civilization thrives

20:30.960 --> 20:37.120
until it over analyzes itself and I think that what's happening in our world is we're we don't

20:37.120 --> 20:44.160
really live connected so much to nature we don't live connected to a spiritual tradition we don't

20:44.160 --> 20:52.720
live connected to our history and culture we our art has become too intellectualized it's become too

20:52.720 --> 21:00.880
conceptual not powerful visceral and metaphoric in its nature as most great art is and so we've

21:00.880 --> 21:07.600
been cut loose and we're all kind of at a loss and when we try to talk to one another across

21:07.600 --> 21:14.640
these spaces we tend to talk in very theoretical terms so people talk about a theory of politics a

21:14.640 --> 21:20.320
theory of economics and a theory of how people behave and so usually this is inaccurate over

21:20.320 --> 21:28.320
simple and so it's that that gets us into this frame of mind because the left hemisphere's message

21:28.320 --> 21:35.440
is money for old road it's incredibly simple we're just apes that compete for territory money and power

21:35.440 --> 21:42.080
that's the left hemisphere's knowledge because let me put it this way the left hemisphere's

21:42.080 --> 21:47.600
resolve debt is to make us powerful to help us grab things it controls the right hand which

21:47.600 --> 21:55.040
from most of us is the one which we do the grabbing and the manipulating and it helps us maintain power

21:55.040 --> 22:00.000
but all the rest of the understanding of everything else that humans are capable of the life of

22:00.960 --> 22:08.560
the spirit the life of of of morality of beauty of goodness of truth all these things are somehow

22:08.560 --> 22:15.440
left out of this picture and become somehow marginalized or trivialized as they have done

22:15.440 --> 22:21.280
I believe in our culture at the moment and so why I wrote the matter with things was because I could

22:21.280 --> 22:27.280
see that we all agree there is something that is the matter with things I mean very few people think

22:27.280 --> 22:36.560
everything's going fine right now but it's also a notice of the fact that we overvalue

22:36.560 --> 22:43.360
matter in the most simple sense I actually say that materialists are not people who overvalue

22:43.360 --> 22:47.440
matter they're people who undervalue matter because matter is a very extraordinary thing

22:48.080 --> 22:55.280
matter is wonderful but this kind of simple idea of matter is what we we tend to overestimate the

22:55.280 --> 23:04.000
power of the consciousness and the spirit the mind is is somehow a secondary secretion of

23:04.560 --> 23:10.080
matter which it cannot be and that we've made a world up out of things which is how the left hand

23:10.080 --> 23:17.040
is here puts things together whereas I believe the importance in in everything lies in relationship

23:17.040 --> 23:20.960
not in what we call the things themselves that are related

23:22.080 --> 23:27.280
So many thoughts Ian let me let me go off on a tangent here

23:29.840 --> 23:38.160
I would say that historically the animus religions would probably have a better

23:38.160 --> 23:44.400
balance between the left and the right hemispheres and the story that I've put together with the

23:44.480 --> 23:54.240
energy hungry emergent cultural super organism kind of started with the agricultural revolution

23:54.240 --> 24:04.720
10 to 12,000 years ago which was in many ways a fall from grace because we were living close

24:04.720 --> 24:14.240
to limits but we were living with the right brain appreciation of the relationships with ourselves

24:14.240 --> 24:22.240
with our surroundings with nature with other species is it possible that as the population

24:22.240 --> 24:31.760
expanded and then exploded that our world is so full of things and stories about the things

24:31.760 --> 24:39.440
and advertising about the things that the left brain has no choice but to intercede and take over

24:40.240 --> 24:43.200
I'm just speculating what do you what do you think about all that

24:45.360 --> 24:52.240
Well I think it's very tempting for the left hemisphere to think that it's going to understand

24:52.240 --> 25:01.120
these things but that is part of the problem I think you're right about animistic cultures

25:01.920 --> 25:10.320
I'm not saying that animism is you know the answer to philosophy not in the least

25:10.320 --> 25:15.200
but I think it's a way of understanding something that's very important which is the

25:15.200 --> 25:22.400
relationship of life to the world at large including things that are in our purview that

25:22.400 --> 25:28.320
we wouldn't normally call animate in fact if you suppress the left hemisphere which you can do

25:29.280 --> 25:35.440
experimentally people see things that we would call inanimate sometimes as animate

25:36.000 --> 25:39.840
and if you do the opposite and suppress the right hemisphere they begin to see

25:39.840 --> 25:46.560
even people and animals as like machines or pieces of furniture so I think animism is an expression

25:46.560 --> 25:54.960
of a kind of vision that we could learn from but I think subsequent philosophy has gone much

25:54.960 --> 26:01.280
further in that and I don't know if we want to go there but I hold a view called panentheism

26:01.280 --> 26:08.000
which is that God is in everything and everything is in God and I think that in fact the great loss

26:08.000 --> 26:15.360
in our time is of any spiritual or moral compass any sense of our groundedness in a cosmos that is

26:15.360 --> 26:21.760
beautiful has a direction to it and has meaning in it I mean we're taught that we just paint these

26:21.760 --> 26:27.360
things on the walls of ourselves to cheer ourselves up that we invent meaning and values

26:27.360 --> 26:32.480
and purpose I don't believe this at all in fact the long book the matter with things is

26:32.480 --> 26:38.080
demonstrating exactly how wrong that is and that in fact we don't invent them but we discover them

26:38.080 --> 26:44.240
we literally find them or fail to find them depending on who we are is it possible that

26:44.240 --> 26:49.920
eight billion well look before I ask that you just said you can suppress the left hemisphere

26:49.920 --> 26:56.560
experimentally is that like in a medical situation or can you are there some parlor tricks you can

26:56.560 --> 27:03.440
do at home because that might be a good thing if we all did those experiments as they used to say

27:03.440 --> 27:12.480
in those films don't attempt this at home okay okay yeah um I'm talking about um I'm talking

27:12.480 --> 27:18.400
effectively about something called transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a a process that

27:18.400 --> 27:25.760
will be done in a in a hospital setting or at least in a in a yes in a clinical setting

27:26.480 --> 27:34.640
Ian let me tell you a story let me tell you a story three years ago I was chainsawing on my

27:34.640 --> 27:41.840
property here and I had to crawl under the horse fence to get to the tree and it's electrified

27:41.840 --> 27:48.960
and the electrical fence hit me squarely on the top of my head and it hurt so badly

27:48.960 --> 27:56.560
for five seconds for the next five hours I was in this like zen state where I felt connected

27:56.560 --> 28:03.040
to everything I didn't have like a compulsion to check my phone it was weird and I just always

28:03.040 --> 28:06.240
wondered if that was like a miniature version of what you're describing

28:07.120 --> 28:14.880
but it's a wonderful story thank you I wouldn't like to say really really but I mean of course

28:14.880 --> 28:22.800
just in case anybody's listening who who knows somebody or has ECT it it's done with an anaesthetic

28:22.800 --> 28:28.960
now and you're not aware of it so it's all fine but okay in any case yet passing electric

28:28.960 --> 28:35.680
current through the brain surely does make some changes um yeah where were we we were talking

28:35.680 --> 28:41.360
about yeah you can isolate one at a time but not you know not to try it at home yeah and and

28:42.480 --> 28:49.920
you asked me that question probably for some reason is there a test that you could give people

28:49.920 --> 28:54.880
other than walking into a cocktail party and talking to someone for five year five minutes and

28:54.880 --> 28:59.760
realizing that they're pretty much left brain dominant but is there is there a test like a

28:59.840 --> 29:06.240
psychological test that can see where people are on on behaviorally on this spectrum or is it not

29:06.240 --> 29:12.000
that refined no I mean there are some terrible things on the internet that tell you whether

29:12.000 --> 29:16.080
you're left or right brain but just forget that forget most of everything that's on the internet

29:16.080 --> 29:23.920
unless it comes from me on this topic because it's going to repeat the awful old the awful

29:24.080 --> 29:29.120
old canards about about the the two hemispheres but no there are proper

29:31.760 --> 29:37.760
neuropsychological instruments as we call them that can be administered questionnaires

29:38.800 --> 29:45.600
and can score people but again largely these things were generated before the huge body

29:45.600 --> 29:53.360
of work that I have done and is the 2000 pages or more of these two books together

29:54.400 --> 30:01.280
which really has completely changed the landscape on hemisphere difference most of the things that

30:01.280 --> 30:07.840
people used to say are wrong and there are one or two things that are broadly right but so it is

30:07.840 --> 30:14.080
important and you can tell yes but I mean especially for psychiatrists you can you can tell fairly

30:14.080 --> 30:22.160
quickly if somebody's autistic and autism is a condition which has different manifestations

30:22.160 --> 30:28.640
I think there are autism rather than one simple autism but the communist form of autism is rather

30:28.640 --> 30:34.880
like trying to understand the world on the basis of your left hemisphere alone here's another question

30:34.880 --> 30:40.160
and I'm going to run out of questions I mean I won't run out of questions so I've been involved

30:40.160 --> 30:48.240
in this systems ecology group for 20 years I've got hundreds and hundreds of contacts who live

30:48.320 --> 30:56.240
around the world who are looking at how energy, money, climate change, biodiversity, politics,

30:56.240 --> 31:04.480
anthropology fit together into cohesive story I would say that relative to the standard population

31:05.280 --> 31:13.520
the preponderance of people with Asperger's or something similar is very much high in this group

31:13.520 --> 31:19.520
of people and I wonder if it's something to do with the ability to separate out the noise

31:20.240 --> 31:26.640
which the left brain is very good at focusing on and stepping back and looking at the whole

31:26.640 --> 31:32.560
picture total speculation just wondering if you have any input there. Well I wouldn't want to be

31:32.560 --> 31:36.960
dogmatic and I think that might come into it but there are a couple of other things that come to

31:36.960 --> 31:49.520
mind and one is the capacity for systematization of a linear and left hemisphere congruent kind

31:50.400 --> 32:02.000
which people with Asperger's or autism have and the other is something I have noticed and was

32:02.000 --> 32:09.840
noticed by others particularly by an important German psychiatrist called Kretschmer in the 1930s

32:10.640 --> 32:18.640
that people who are either come from families of the printer either schizophrenia or autism

32:18.640 --> 32:30.400
or Asperger's the subjects often are very focused on doing good in the abstract but are often not

32:30.400 --> 32:39.280
very good at being warm or kind to individual people so they embrace you know a brilliant idea

32:39.280 --> 32:44.560
that we're going to make the world like this and of course we need people like that but we also need

32:44.560 --> 32:51.120
to have them have their feet planted firmly on the ground because as is well known the most

32:51.840 --> 32:57.920
desperate homicidal and tyrannical regimes in the history of the world started out with people

32:57.920 --> 33:02.560
having an idea how to make humanity better and forcing them to be better.

33:03.360 --> 33:14.240
There are ways that we can expand our boundaries of empathy and care and start to recognize that

33:14.240 --> 33:21.520
we're part of a whole that we're related to all other life on the planet that this is the one blue

33:21.600 --> 33:30.960
green oasis in a dark cold universe and I think we are approaching a species level conversation

33:30.960 --> 33:38.080
so your work I actually think is foundational to that that we have to shift from a me to an us

33:38.640 --> 33:45.600
somehow. Now there's been in the last couple years a lot of movement towards psychedelics like

33:45.600 --> 33:58.640
ayahuasca or five MEO DMT from toad or mushrooms or non-drugs like chanting or rave parties or just

33:58.640 --> 34:08.240
going out in nature but can these substances access the relational skills of the right brain

34:08.240 --> 34:14.800
or what do you think about all that? Well in brief the psychedelics which to me are relatively

34:14.800 --> 34:21.680
uninteresting though they can indeed have lasting effects on people I know from personal testimonies

34:21.680 --> 34:29.680
of people not my own that this can happen. I don't think that it's liberating the right hemisphere

34:30.400 --> 34:35.920
and I explain why I don't think that's what's happening in the matter with things I think

34:35.920 --> 34:42.240
probably what is happening is that the frontal lobes are being suppressed and the frontal lobes are

34:42.240 --> 34:53.440
if you like the filters that by their effect of inhibiting the more posterior cortex shape our

34:53.440 --> 35:00.560
reality by making sense of it and so when you take them off you get a flood of stimuli with no particular

35:02.400 --> 35:09.040
you know way of having filtered that perhaps in the absence of filtering by the frontal cortex

35:09.040 --> 35:15.520
we are more open to spiritual messages but I think that there are very many other ways that we can

35:15.520 --> 35:23.440
much more sound ways you know it's being very much promoted psychedelics as the answer to

35:23.440 --> 35:30.800
depression and other things but the reason for that is that it will cost the pharmaceutical

35:30.800 --> 35:36.160
industry absolutely nothing to market these substances they're already known and they will

35:36.160 --> 35:41.040
have they'll never need to work again because they can just make money out of providing these

35:41.040 --> 35:49.200
purified substances and so they are very much skewing the the dialogue on this and what's not

35:49.200 --> 35:55.040
known so widely is that you can have terrible experiences using psychedelics which are

35:55.600 --> 36:02.560
devastating to your psyche so you're playing with fire so I would like to take the conversation

36:02.560 --> 36:08.480
away from that and to the things that really really do matter if you're happy with that which are

36:09.920 --> 36:19.040
relating to a society to a social group relating to nature and relating to

36:20.160 --> 36:27.920
some whatever you like to call it higher power divine ground the sacred these things are not

36:27.920 --> 36:34.080
just my opinion that they're important for us there is vast research that shows that they are

36:35.440 --> 36:43.520
very important for mental well-being for physical well-being well-being for cognitive skill

36:44.480 --> 36:53.680
and for the cohesion of a society so clearly the sacred or the belief in any deity or god

36:53.680 --> 36:59.760
or anything like that has to emanate from the right hemisphere so

37:01.360 --> 37:11.600
right now to me it seems like the belief in religion is is waning as the driving force

37:11.600 --> 37:18.880
relative to the last couple hundred years but also right now the belief in economic growth

37:18.880 --> 37:25.440
or the you know capitalism and economic growth has become a religion of sorts

37:26.080 --> 37:32.720
so neither of those I mean that's what our sacred is now and you don't know much about my work Ian but

37:33.520 --> 37:40.800
I'm a champion for the 10 million other species we share this planet with and I deeply view the

37:40.800 --> 37:48.160
natural world as sacred and that's what's our calling right now is we kind of had to go through

37:48.160 --> 37:59.760
this last 200 years of Las Vegas smorgasbord uh energy um orgy of of of things uh to maybe recognize

37:59.760 --> 38:09.680
whoa uh maybe the next technology is inner tech in our minds um towards this this sacred

38:09.680 --> 38:12.560
destination uh what what do you think about all that

38:16.640 --> 38:24.000
well first of all I'm I you know that that I believe in the importance of the other living

38:24.720 --> 38:33.280
elements of our of our planet um and even even things that we think of as inanimate and exploits

38:33.840 --> 38:40.080
have their value and their place so I wholly agree with you we're we're seeing from the

38:40.080 --> 38:46.400
hape same hymn sheet there I'm not sure that religion only comes from the right hemisphere

38:46.400 --> 38:52.400
but I do think you're right that the most important parts of religious experience and practice seem

38:52.400 --> 38:58.880
to be the consensus is seem to be underwritten by the right hemisphere the left hemisphere is

38:58.880 --> 39:07.920
was necessary for systematizing it and turning it into a durable um phenomenon such as Christianity

39:07.920 --> 39:19.120
or whatever it may be Islam or but but in doing so it often over legalizes makes over certain

39:19.120 --> 39:26.880
over fixed what should be less certain more fluid more or inspiring in fact I think we've

39:26.880 --> 39:36.160
lost the capacity for three very important things a sense of awe or wonder a sense of our own humility

39:36.800 --> 39:44.000
and or the humility we should have and compassion and I think these are the things that

39:45.440 --> 39:49.520
most religions that are real religions or spiritual traditions that are true spiritual

39:49.520 --> 39:57.600
traditions have in common that they induce and re re can kindle in us a sense of wonder

39:58.480 --> 40:05.200
they make us feel appropriately humble about what we can do and what we can know and they increase

40:06.560 --> 40:14.480
sense of oneness with and compassion towards the rest of the created world now I think that is

40:14.720 --> 40:22.240
is what's going wrong I think this we've completely failed to understand that religion is not

40:23.360 --> 40:29.280
about a matter of propositional belief but dispositional belief belief is a matter of

40:29.280 --> 40:34.720
a disposition of your your your consciousness towards the world in a certain way it's not

40:34.720 --> 40:40.560
about propositions that you know six impossible things that you have to believe before breakfast

40:41.280 --> 40:47.440
that's not for a relationship about and what I want to do in in my work is take people from a

40:47.440 --> 40:52.160
standpoint where they will almost certainly be part of the the culture that believes that only

40:52.160 --> 41:01.280
somebody rather simple or you know uneducated would think that there was a divine realm to

41:01.280 --> 41:07.200
position where they will see that only somebody who's rather simple or uneducated would think that

41:07.200 --> 41:11.840
would just want to rule that out I'm not saying would become suddenly religious but I think it's

41:11.840 --> 41:22.160
extremely clear that people who either are fundamentalist religious or fundamentalist

41:22.160 --> 41:26.800
atheists are on the wrong track and that they have more in common with one another than they

41:26.800 --> 41:32.800
have with true believing people in any case I just think that that business of the ever-evolving

41:32.880 --> 41:38.080
deeper relationship a loving relationship with the world in all its manifestations

41:38.720 --> 41:45.520
is is the secret of human well-being and happiness and you say that there is now a

41:45.520 --> 41:53.120
different religion that of economic growth and so on and I you know have quenched in myself in

41:53.120 --> 41:58.320
the last 24 hours of it with with what you've you've said about this I find it very compelling

41:58.640 --> 42:04.480
I'm sure you're you're broadly right and it reminds me of something that GK Chesterton said

42:04.480 --> 42:09.360
that when people stop believing in God they don't believe in nothing they believe in anything

42:11.120 --> 42:20.880
and that anything for them is their own power to become more and more rich powerful wealthy and

42:20.880 --> 42:27.360
that leaves out of the count just about everything that sustains human happiness and in the seeking

42:27.440 --> 42:33.360
for it they will never find happiness as a psychiatrist I can tell you that the most

42:33.360 --> 42:38.560
successful people the richest people the most powerful people are not the world's happiest people

42:39.760 --> 42:45.760
as a former high net worth stockbroker on wall street I totally concur with that assessment

42:47.600 --> 42:54.480
so you mentioned earlier there were some previous cultures that were successful at this empathy and

42:54.560 --> 43:01.840
compassion and a sense of you didn't mention sacred but what were the commonalities in these

43:01.840 --> 43:09.760
societies and how did that evolve or don't we have historical data to know what happened

43:10.320 --> 43:17.920
yes it's difficult one thing that's a surprise is that a properly functioning society in which

43:17.920 --> 43:22.560
the two hemispheres are really working in the complementary but asymmetrical way that they

43:22.560 --> 43:32.720
should seem to arise just like that that you think that the civilization took a very long time to

43:32.720 --> 43:40.640
build you know but actually these civilizations just sort of seem to arise in a relatively short

43:40.640 --> 43:47.040
time span and work well and then gradually always move further towards the right hemisphere and one

43:47.040 --> 43:53.200
of the aspects of this is I could put it this way that the left hemisphere is always trying to

43:53.200 --> 43:58.880
close down on a certainty but the right hemisphere is always trying to open up to a possibility

43:59.600 --> 44:03.520
and that explains much of the difference between the way the hemisphere see the world

44:04.320 --> 44:12.800
and in these early stages of civilization people are very open to possibility and this is a very

44:12.880 --> 44:19.040
fruitful frame of mind they have very few sentences but they know that nothing will

44:19.040 --> 44:24.960
prosper unless they give of themselves it's no good sitting back and waiting for it to build

44:24.960 --> 44:33.600
itself so a civilization goes through one might say three phrases really and and and this is

44:34.560 --> 44:41.520
being very beautifully written about by Patrick Offalls in a book called a moderate greatness

44:41.520 --> 44:48.720
a very short book when he points out that he was on this podcast Ian oh was he oh fantastic

44:48.720 --> 44:54.400
well he's a bit of a good friend of mine oh yeah that's great he's 90 years old and he's sharp as

44:54.400 --> 45:02.800
attack he's just great I'm always recommending his book to people but as you know I mean he suggested

45:02.800 --> 45:10.400
in the first phase people are very brave um they they give of themselves they're generous spirited

45:10.400 --> 45:15.760
they create things and they defend them and so on and then there comes a period when the as

45:15.760 --> 45:20.800
well the groundwork has been laid and now we can move on to more sophisticated things we get the

45:21.600 --> 45:28.080
arising of philosophy and art and and so forth and that's a very benign phase but after a while

45:28.080 --> 45:33.120
we go into a decadent phase where people just expect that this is the normal that they don't

45:33.120 --> 45:38.640
have to do anything for it to carry on that it's their right that it is you know I'm always when

45:38.720 --> 45:45.760
people say a right I always a little mental question where does this right come from exactly

45:45.760 --> 45:49.360
I'm not saying that there is no use for the term right but I think it needs to be

45:50.160 --> 45:56.320
you know thought about rather more carefully than we do anyway I think this is what happens and I can

45:56.320 --> 46:05.520
see certainly movements in eastern civilizations which all my life have fascinated me I'm probably

46:05.840 --> 46:13.360
a Taoist um I'm probably a Buddhist um and I'm very interested in the Vedanta

46:14.160 --> 46:21.520
and in these traditions you see a kind of wisdom that comes from a degree of humility

46:21.520 --> 46:28.560
of letting go of control of letting go of certain knowledge in order to attain wisdom

46:29.440 --> 46:34.880
you know the the Tao De Ching begins with the line the Tao that can be named is not the real Tao

46:35.600 --> 46:41.360
and you know it also contains the lines that the master does nothing but nothing is left undone

46:41.360 --> 46:47.360
I mean that those those need to be glossed but they're really a way of saying that our obsession

46:47.360 --> 46:56.080
with immediate action and doing and being busy and increasing our knowledge is actually a way of

46:56.080 --> 47:02.000
stopping ourselves achieving either peace or wisdom and in the context of this conversation

47:02.480 --> 47:07.520
I mean whether people in achieve peace for themselves it's a personal matter but if they

47:07.520 --> 47:13.440
don't achieve some wisdom if there aren't people speaking wisely our civilization is definitely

47:13.440 --> 47:22.160
doomed so again this is our first conversation um despite having mutual friends and mutual interest

47:22.160 --> 47:29.920
one of the key learnings for me this past decade uh in brain research was that humans didn't evolve

47:30.880 --> 47:39.680
to see reality um fitness at the time mattered more than than truth and I I've taught a class

47:40.240 --> 47:45.760
at the University of Minnesota called Reality 101 a survey of the human predicament

47:46.560 --> 47:55.200
and it's an environmental class for mostly for freshmen but can learning about reality about

47:55.280 --> 48:01.360
the different hemispheres about our brains about supernormal stimuli and and all the different

48:02.000 --> 48:08.880
things we inherited from our ancestors um and their interrelationships can that change

48:09.440 --> 48:15.760
our behavior at the individual and ultimately at the couch cultural level or does it have to come

48:15.760 --> 48:24.400
at a two-part question so my work here with this podcast is to educate and warn people about the

48:24.400 --> 48:32.000
future that Patrick Ophels uh also believes is happening is that our energy surplus declines

48:32.000 --> 48:38.800
and as the the carrying capacity and environmental health of our world decline we're we're in for a

48:38.800 --> 48:48.880
tough road um so in my articulating and having conversations with you and others do the facts

48:48.880 --> 48:58.960
matter or is it really a do we need like a new narrative of meaning of sacredness and the facts

48:58.960 --> 49:05.680
don't matter as much that's that's a big bite what what do you think about that I think facts are

49:05.680 --> 49:18.000
important um I think in certain areas of life claiming things to be facts needs to be carefully done

49:19.760 --> 49:27.680
but the but we shouldn't lose the sense that there are facts I think that what science teaches us

49:27.680 --> 49:36.560
is important very important as a road to truth I think that reason properly understood are you

49:36.560 --> 49:45.360
not just a kind of rationalizing about things that could be done by chat GPT but I mean the fusion

49:45.360 --> 49:52.560
of the experience of a life well lived and judgment based on that and the ability to see

49:52.560 --> 49:58.880
things in the overall context combined with the ability to think clearly and express oneself clearly

49:58.880 --> 50:04.560
is very important I also think that letting go of those things is important because they have

50:04.560 --> 50:10.400
limitations they can't expect to be used to answer some of the big questions which appear

50:10.400 --> 50:17.600
paradoxical to the left hemisphere but nonetheless are on the path to the deep realities as

50:19.040 --> 50:28.880
Niels Bohr perhaps the greatest figure in the genesis of quantum physics said and as the great

50:28.880 --> 50:35.200
leaders of most religious leads in the mystical traditions of most religions and spiritual pathways

50:35.200 --> 50:42.000
have said so in the second part of the matter with things the first part I'm just looking at

50:42.000 --> 50:48.880
really what we need to understand about the left hemisphere's incapacity to be in touch with the

50:48.880 --> 50:53.840
real world compared with the right hemisphere now that's the reverse of what the prop psychology

50:53.840 --> 51:01.040
thing tells us the left hemisphere may be boring and down to earth but at least it's you know it's

51:01.120 --> 51:06.800
reliable um however that's not the case it's extremely unreliable compared with the right

51:06.800 --> 51:12.160
hemisphere which is much more in touch with reality and a much better touchstone when we

51:12.160 --> 51:17.840
come to decide what we should believe anyway that's part one but in part two I look at the various

51:17.840 --> 51:24.880
pathways to truth and I say they are science reason and intuition and imagination and that

51:24.880 --> 51:30.240
all four of these need to be brought to bear if we're going to function properly as a society and

51:30.480 --> 51:36.880
understand who we are what we're doing here and how we are to relate to the world at large

51:37.760 --> 51:41.840
and then in the last part of the book it's metaphysics and I look at things like

51:41.840 --> 51:49.040
the the coincidence of opposites the one and the many but also things like time space matter

51:49.040 --> 51:56.400
consciousness values purpose and the sense of the sacred so I'm looking at all of those things

51:56.400 --> 52:03.040
so what I want to say is my book is based on science and on a lot of philosophizing so there's

52:03.040 --> 52:10.880
a great deal of facts in it I quote in one book five thousand five hundred sources and in the other

52:10.880 --> 52:16.960
about two and a half thousand so together there's a lot so I do rely on those things and I think

52:16.960 --> 52:23.920
that our tendency to to um for example dismiss science if it happens to say things that are not

52:24.000 --> 52:30.480
fashionable or politically correct is absolutely a disaster for us all and for science so

52:31.040 --> 52:39.120
science is non-negotiable in that sense and although everything can you need to look at

52:39.120 --> 52:44.720
the light in which it's interpreted but we can't do away with it so I think understanding

52:45.600 --> 52:52.560
what is going on in our heads and how it's affecting the way we see the world is really

52:52.560 --> 53:04.560
important and in that sense I'd go as far as to say that if we're to get out of this situation

53:04.560 --> 53:08.560
people always say so what are we to do what are we to do and they want you know half a dozen bullet

53:08.560 --> 53:13.920
points and are you know half a dozen bullet points that I can give but in a way they're

53:13.920 --> 53:17.840
they're at a very low level they're like practical things that can be done now and they're not

53:17.920 --> 53:24.560
unimportant but actually I know that unless we change the whole way we conceive what humanity

53:24.560 --> 53:30.240
is what the world is and how the two create connect we will not get this right and it

53:30.240 --> 53:35.360
wouldn't even matter if we did save our skins because we would not have saved our souls and

53:35.360 --> 53:42.080
without that we would just continue being the same frustrated greedy desperate people that we

53:42.080 --> 53:49.600
seem to be now so I think we have to see the predicament and the reason I think that I would

53:49.600 --> 53:55.680
like as many people as possible to read and talk about my work is it's a contribution to that debate

53:55.680 --> 54:02.240
you know that it's a really substantial thing that it costs me you know decades of my life and I

54:02.240 --> 54:06.960
think that people are responding to it by the messages I get all the time from people saying

54:07.040 --> 54:12.640
your your work has changed my life now if most writers if they get that once they're delighted

54:12.640 --> 54:17.760
but I get that get that every day in fact today amongst several messages that kind of got one

54:17.760 --> 54:22.960
that said it would be an underestimate to say that your work has changed my life so I'm not I'm

54:22.960 --> 54:27.840
delighted always to hear this because I don't know I can only tell whether this is important from

54:27.840 --> 54:33.920
the reactions I get from other people but I think unless you know I'm a psychiatrist and I learned

54:33.920 --> 54:39.680
very early on that you can tell what people need to do very very early on and you can say it but

54:39.680 --> 54:44.560
they won't do it because they need to have been brought to the place where they see for themselves

54:44.560 --> 54:50.080
that that's what they need to do so we need to get humanity to a point where they see for themselves

54:50.080 --> 54:58.960
that what they're doing is crazy suicidal are you taking on new patients no

54:59.040 --> 55:07.760
no I'm 70 and I had to make a decision some time ago that you know I was going to write and

55:07.760 --> 55:15.520
lecture rather than carry on with the day job so no I was being facetious but what you just said

55:15.520 --> 55:22.480
rings hella true to me so I was being facetious so what I hear you saying is that science is

55:22.480 --> 55:29.600
necessary but insufficient and that if we look at the human predicament with climate change and

55:30.160 --> 55:36.160
population and resource depletion and everything else and if we try to construct a path through

55:36.160 --> 55:44.480
that using only engineers and architects we will fail because we have to look at the other uh what

55:44.480 --> 55:50.240
did you say imagination creativity you had four four categories we have to integrate all of those

55:50.240 --> 55:57.840
intuition and imagination and I know that intuition is often a target for people in cognitive

55:57.840 --> 56:02.720
neuroscience and of course some people have made a career out of it like Dan Kahneman and

56:02.720 --> 56:09.440
professionally suspicious of intuition I talk about his work which is in many ways very important

56:09.440 --> 56:16.000
in in my book the matter of things but I think that intuitions had a bad rap and because there

56:16.000 --> 56:20.320
are certain situations which are the highly artificial in which you can show that following

56:20.320 --> 56:26.160
your intuition won't lead to the right answer that is the flip side of the fact that we are

56:27.040 --> 56:35.600
we are able to make very complex decisions fairly quickly using intuition although

56:35.600 --> 56:42.560
intuition is not thinking fast sometimes intuitions are deep and take a long time to come

56:42.560 --> 56:49.200
through and sometimes rationalizing is what we do thinking fast and quickly so you know people

56:49.200 --> 56:55.040
sometimes say is Kahneman's you know type one thinking um the right hemisphere and type two

56:55.040 --> 56:59.280
thinking left no if anything it would be the other way around but it's really more that

57:00.560 --> 57:06.880
type one thinking is sub-cortical is kind of almost instinctive whereas a richer

57:07.440 --> 57:14.480
combination of intuition and reason involves both hemispheres so it's a it's a different thing but

57:14.480 --> 57:22.320
anyway I just wanted to put in a word for intuition because I think our willingness to um discard

57:22.320 --> 57:30.320
discontent to and um generally despise our intuitions is one of the reasons we've become so

57:30.320 --> 57:37.040
stupid I mean there are many things that I believe now that if there is a humanity in the future

57:37.040 --> 57:44.080
people will look back on it as the most absurd era we are part of the most ridiculous era of

57:44.080 --> 57:51.440
humanity in which completely improbable and very stupid things are said by highly intelligent

57:51.440 --> 57:56.720
people and if they had any contact at all with their intuitions they would guide them to a much

57:56.720 --> 58:04.160
much wiser place so I suspect that lots of people in our culture have trauma

58:05.520 --> 58:12.640
we are living through an absolute crazy twilight zone sort of era a lot of people are stressed

58:13.280 --> 58:20.240
I think intuitively the listeners and viewers of this program will agree with you that they would

58:20.320 --> 58:28.240
like to expand or lean into their right brain more they want to be connected with the birds and the

58:28.240 --> 58:34.800
trees and their garden and with relationships at a slower pace and they see how everything is connected

58:34.800 --> 58:39.360
and they care like you and I do about the 10 million other species we share the planet with

58:40.000 --> 58:46.240
but the needs of the day we have to have a job to get health insurance otherwise we go broke if we

58:46.240 --> 58:52.800
get sick we have to build defense mechanisms against all the polarization shouting on on

58:52.800 --> 59:01.360
YouTube and in social media are the wants of the day forcing the left brain to take over and not

59:01.360 --> 59:08.400
allow people to reflect on the relationships between everything what what do you think about that

59:08.400 --> 59:13.360
well let me be clear there is nothing wrong with the left hemisphere in itself

59:13.760 --> 59:20.000
it's a very valuable servant it is the emissary to the master and as such is irreplaceable we need

59:20.000 --> 59:28.080
it and we need the work that it can do all I'm really saying is that it must be aware that it

59:28.080 --> 59:33.920
is a servant not the master and at the moment it thinks it's the master it thinks it has all the

59:33.920 --> 59:40.880
answers and that's the bit that makes it a problem so I'm not saying of course I'm not and I think

59:41.840 --> 59:48.320
I started what I've just been saying by saying that we really do need the everyday stuff we need

59:48.320 --> 59:56.240
the jobs and we need to put in place particular measures legal measures maybe scientific plans

59:56.240 --> 01:00:02.480
to try and stop the poisoning of the oceans all that all of that I agree with but what I'm really

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:09.200
saying is that that's not enough that's only a part of the story and and perhaps in some ways

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:14.960
although it sounds stupid to say this is less important than being able to see things

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:21.360
in a different way because if we did we wouldn't need we wouldn't need to be doing it all by

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:28.240
constraint and restraint we need constraints and restraints in life one of the paradoxes is that

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:34.720
for a society to be free it needs to observe certain restraints but when you say we need to have

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.680
um whatever it was you said mechanisms in place to sort of police the social media

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:50.880
if we were more aware of the shallowness as a way we talk and think so often nowadays

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.560
in sound bites and without having really thought about things deeply and probably not from a

01:00:56.560 --> 01:01:03.520
background of humane education which is now a rarity compared with what it was 40 50 years ago

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.720
if we were aware of that there wouldn't be the need to police it in that way you know I mean

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:16.880
during my lifetime people have become obviously much less civilized they've become um

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.120
willing and able to treat one another with greater violence verbal physical and in other

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:31.680
ways so we're not we're in a realm where we're so badly dehumanized already that the only way

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:37.600
to help is by imposing kind of rules which in themselves constrain our better nature

01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:48.080
as well as our unfortunate tendencies of of now so in that last bit you mentioned the word

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:56.000
aware or awareness four times I right now have a new coach who's an expert in something called

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:06.320
Feldenkrais which is awareness through movement and her advice to me is all I'm asking for you is

01:02:07.440 --> 01:02:13.920
for awareness and once you become aware of something then for the first time you have choices

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:20.800
and a couple days ago she sent me this beautiful quote by Victor Frankel between stimulus and

01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:29.840
response there is a space in that space is our power to choose our response in our response lies

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:36.480
our growth and our freedom so I'm just wondering how that maps if at all to the left brain right

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:42.880
brain story that you're unpacking is the left brain jumping into this space in our culture

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:49.280
and then owning the narrative in response and would more awareness kind of give us a more

01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:57.200
merger of the two hemispheres in a healthy way what I'd certainly say is that that is a wonderful

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:05.520
the quote that I know from Victor Frankel who is a very very great man of course and I think that

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:13.200
what I'm suggesting without going one way or other on the hemispheres is that we

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:25.120
are too ready to jump in we have lost the art of thinking deeply of pondering of embracing silence

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:32.880
of thinking in a longer term over a broader span which you narrow

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.320
especially and temporally if you like in the way in which we think we're too committed to a point

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:47.040
of view that we may never have been taught to challenge and so forth so what I'm saying is

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:57.120
that we live in a society that is becoming stupid because reflective reading proper acquaintance

01:03:57.120 --> 01:04:05.840
with history not in some ridiculous propagandizing way in which we either uncritically accept it or

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:14.320
uncritically despise it but in fact trying to understand the people who are not necessarily

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:19.440
any less wise than we were who came before us and what they created for us and what we owe to them

01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:27.840
so not having that not having been taught to think on two sides of a question we're reacting in

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:34.560
two peremptory way and slowing down would be a very very fine thing most of what we do would be

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:40.400
better done more slowly there are very few things that are done well by just speeding them up and

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.840
yet we live in a world which is constantly demanding more and more speed less and less reflection

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:55.680
right and so we're compelled to use the devil's tools to do guy's work of a sort I mean I feel

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.680
that every day I mean look at us we're using you know high technology to communicate these ideas

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:08.800
to more people in an attempt to hopefully have people learn and slow down in their own lives

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:15.920
so so so getting to that one of my prior guests who I believe is a friend of yours Tomas Bjorkman

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:25.280
he's an advocate of nurturing inner development skills which he categorizes as being thinking

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:35.840
relating collaborating and and acting so do you think reflective practices and teachings such as

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:43.440
those can can reconnect the balancing of the two hemispheres or leaving this hemisphere's aside

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:51.520
just make us more holistic human beings in this time of of tumult yes I do um

01:05:51.520 --> 01:06:00.320
um there are certain things we can't experience unless we slow down and that we must experience

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:07.520
when we speed up when we speed up we become fearful we become panic-stricken and I think we

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:17.600
should stop panicking which is not to say anything about being aware of the gravity of our situation

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:24.560
in fact we'll be more aware of the gravity of our situation if we stop and reflect I think we

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:32.800
should cultivate things like gratitude which we won't do if we're rushing through life appreciating

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:46.080
what we have while we still have it um appreciating silence silence is like water to me it's like some

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:52.880
delicious nourishing liquid I can't get enough of it it's one of the reasons I live where I do

01:06:52.880 --> 01:07:01.280
in a rather remote part of a Scottish island and when I have to go as I quite often do back into

01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:12.480
modern urban life I'm initially overwhelmed by its its madness I'm sure there are pockets where people

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:20.000
can find the necessary stillness but unless they do they're going to rush headlong to their death

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.560
so they're going to push us all over that cliff faster than ever um if we have a chance to stop

01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:34.320
it would be a very good thing to do I think we should reconnect as I say with with the natural

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:41.680
world spend more time there and listen to it we should pray and meditate more and that also

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:51.840
means listening not talking it means adapting your ear to hear what is constantly being said to you by

01:07:53.760 --> 01:08:00.720
by the universe by what exists we have a I'm saying everything is in relationships and

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:08.480
those relationships are always two-way they'll always reverberate it and we drive out what we

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:16.160
could learn by constantly talking and so what we need to do is to cultivate mindfulness if you like

01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:22.400
or an attitude of prayer which which is also a matter of listening not demanding anything but

01:08:22.400 --> 01:08:30.960
trying to reflect on what one can know in relation to spiritual values particularly

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:40.480
um you know and and I think so a slower culture would be a great thing and when we're actually

01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:48.240
hurtling towards the precipice why would we try and speed it up by inventing ever more sophisticated

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:55.600
technology that will push us faster and faster that way is technology is just a way of giving

01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:01.280
people power and power is neither good nor bad it depends on who's wielding it and to what end

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.640
it needs wisdom and at the moment what we're doing is we're creating very powerful mechanism

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:13.120
we're giving them to people who haven't any of the wisdom to use them properly and so what we need

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:20.000
is more wisdom not more power and I'm afraid the way we're talking at the moment it's all about

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:27.120
increasing our power to do things this has got us into the mess and as Einstein famously said

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:31.760
we don't get out of the mess by the same means that got us into it we need to be starting

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:39.920
to simplify I think one of your your terms is the great simplification we need to simplify

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:48.400
our lives our goals uh what do we expect out of life and in some way sophisticated what we

01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:54.560
feel we can give to life I have four questions in response to what you just said my first one is

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:59.600
what sort of megafauna and wildlife do you have on the isle of sky what's interesting there that

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:09.360
you periodically or rarely see um above all we have very interesting bird life there are eagles

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:15.200
that nest on the mountain behind my house golden eagles we also have fish eagles we have raptors

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:24.000
of various kinds but we also have marsh birds we have um woodland birds um in my garden you get

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:32.400
garden birds so we have an extraordinarily rich panoply of of bird life um there are animals

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:42.400
there are deer wild deer of course on the island much of the land is cultivated where it can be

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:51.280
or at least given over to sheep and cattle so the kind of farm animals but there are there is a

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:59.520
range of wildlife as you know if you try to keep chickens as I do and and sometimes that the wild

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:05.600
mammalian life is not necessarily on your side or not on your chicken side anyway um so there's a

01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:12.640
lot of that and very beautiful landscape I mean it's just um a staggering mixture of of

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:19.600
things that I never get used to I see it and it takes my breath away yeah I I'm blessed to live

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:25.280
where I do on the Mississippi River um and there are lots of wild animals here and it's my biggest

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:31.520
joy in life is to see something like a fox when I'm on a bike ride etc so I just wanted to ask

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:41.520
you that so um you talked about us uh slower culture um I agree with that um but how would

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:49.280
that come about it's certainly not from any top down regulations or laws or rules it almost has to

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:57.840
come out about from from individual humans realizing this starting to listen more starting

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:06.160
to focus on relationships and maybe that expands outward to a critical mass do you have any speculation

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:12.480
on that well I think you're exactly right that it must start with individual people but that

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:20.320
sounds like a very tall order when we've got to make things make things happen you know yes we're

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:25.440
in a crisis but we won't be so effective if we think we need to rush to make things happen

01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:36.160
if only three percent of the population saw the kind of vision of the world the kind of

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:45.600
meaning in the world that I hope to unveil to readers we would automatically move not by top

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:54.480
down control but by an inner desire we would be led to things that I can't now specify what they

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:58.720
will be because they will be different from every person that is the wonderful thing about it

01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.680
of something that is generated from within and goes outwards rather than something that is a

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:11.040
straight jacket that comes down from above and I think there's something to be said for relaxing

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:19.520
some of the controls because we need to learn how to discipline ourselves um the culture of

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:26.320
particularly my grandparents and and of my parents was so very much more one of

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:35.200
self-discipline and selflessness than the culture that I now inhabit and it meant that a lot of

01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.160
things didn't have to be policed or ruled or legislated about in the way that they are now

01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:43.600
of course it wasn't a perfect world I'm certainly not suggesting that for a minute

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.880
and you know in the background all sorts of things were undoubtedly going on

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:57.600
but the fact is that we've become morally like somebody who's decided for no very good reason

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.800
that they need a wheelchair and after they've been in the wheelchair for quite a long time

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:08.080
they would be much better off without the wheelchair but they can't now stand without

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:14.080
that wheelchair and we're like that morally speaking we need all these props and supports to

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:20.000
keep us on the right line but if we're to survive we need to get back to a place in which we re

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:27.200
integrate into our personality and into our sense of ourselves some sense of what is now

01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:33.840
seems so old-fashioned like being a decent person like being you know an honorable person

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:40.720
but being magnanimous by being generous by being faithful all these things that you know we now

01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:46.000
think we're far cleverer than that that's the kind of stuff for stupid people who don't really know

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:53.520
how to win we're gonna win and of course that attitude has destroyed a society that was actually

01:14:53.520 --> 01:15:01.200
working relatively well so I think we've got to get back there the bad news is that I don't think

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:11.280
that's going to happen until some sort of catastrophe has happened which will insist on it that we

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:17.360
learn again how to look after one another in small groups to trust one another to work together to

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:25.120
have much simpler ambitions and and demands on the planet to be able to grow our own food

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:29.600
to relearn skills that our ancestors had but we thought we didn't need could we got machines

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:38.000
and generally I think you know people say well you know what's going to happen will life die out

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:43.520
I don't see any evidence that life will die out I think our way of life as it now is must die out

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:51.200
it can't go on and I think that a lot of humans sadly will not survive but I think that humanity

01:15:52.000 --> 01:16:00.000
will probably survive and will be the better for it we need we're so badly adrift now that

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:08.480
we need something that will you know inspire us to re-embrace our deeper humanity that's

01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:16.320
really what I'm saying well it's no wonder that you like Patrick Ophel's writing he says

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:22.800
very similar things and and I say very similar things you're inspiring to me this conversation

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:31.280
is inspiring what we're trying to do is change the initial conditions of that catastrophe or that

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:39.280
moment in the future so that there's a wider array of positive or more benign outcomes that happen

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.800
one of the other constraints that I that I see is there are people listening to this and nodding

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:54.000
their heads and saying this makes sense I want to move my life in this direction a little bit

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:02.480
I want to be one of those 3% but then a few hours later Candy Crush and their little social media

01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:09.840
feeds and the things on their phone and in our our pal mel smorgasbord tech culture

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:18.160
virtual world shouts louder to our brains than the reality that you are describing so we get

01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:24.800
pulled back into that vortex do you have recommendations for for people on how to how

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:32.640
to push that aside or how to inhibit that um that craving a little bit towards this longer

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:39.600
term path well I think as usual it's a matter of finding a balance but a balance that is very far

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:48.240
from where we are now so I think that my advice would be drastically to reduce any use of social

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:55.600
media whatever I don't actually use it myself at all and somebody does my publicity for me so

01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:02.640
that's nice I can it's kind of if you like a hypocrisy for me that you know I need the message

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.680
to get out there but I don't want to be on social media however I work hard at putting the measure

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:13.920
out the message out there by doing things like exactly what we are doing now and some of my friends

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:20.080
say they can't go anywhere on the internet without bumping into me so you can't please everybody

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:28.720
anyway um I think grossly limiting all eliminating all together eliminating social media would be a

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:37.600
very good thing um perhaps limiting how much and in what way you use the internet um trying not to

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:46.240
fuel despair but instead to think of ways in which you can increase love and the embrace of things

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:53.440
that are beautiful and good and truthful and to eliminate resentment from your life and try instead

01:18:53.440 --> 01:19:00.880
to to see what is good and and to listen to other people even if they say things very different from

01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:07.680
you um one of the great calamities of the public debate at the moment is if we don't do a very

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:14.160
very simple thing then you know any therapist who's ever done couple therapy knows which is

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:20.320
you know you get one person talking and you say no no no let him talk and and you'll have your turn

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:25.760
in a minute and then at the end of that you turn to the other partner and say so what did you hear

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:34.160
your partner just say and and that's very instructive for everybody and if we did that more

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.520
we would get round misunderstanding because you say well actually that's what you heard me say but

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:45.920
that's not what I meant what I meant was this I see and then you've got a dialogue Gary but at the

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:51.760
moment we're just shouting one another down and and anybody who has a certain kind of opinion

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:59.120
which embraces many opinions that seem to me to be full of wisdom must be an outcast and so

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:05.040
it's an extraordinary situation in which the people that need to be heard can't speak

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:10.720
without being shouted down by those who are full of their own importance and narcissistically sure

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:15.520
that they are the good people who are fighting for the good only one thing I'd like to get across

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:22.080
is the idea of the dark side very important idea again in psychology everybody has a dark side and

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:27.360
there's a dark side to everything that we promote is good and there's a good side often to things

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:33.120
that we want to eliminate I mean there are certain things that are non-negotiable I agree and we're

01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:38.160
better without them but usually it's complicated and there's good and bad mixed in most of the

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:43.040
things that we need to be thinking about here but anyway that's that that's the kind of advice

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:51.280
that I'd give embrace stillness embrace peace and and and love your friends and love nature and

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:59.600
and love life you know I I just started three weeks ago on the advice of another coach Silent

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:08.400
Saturdays where I turned my phone and computers off and it's been way more difficult than I would

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:14.320
have thought but that's a story for another day but I totally agree with everything you just said

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:22.560
another follow-up question to your previous thing that you mentioned AI again so is this

01:21:22.560 --> 01:21:29.040
another thing that in our race to develop artificial intelligence are we in effect

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:35.280
hypercharging this left brain dynamic that you're talking about and further atrophying

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:41.040
the right brain's contribution and do you think second part of the question do you think

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:48.960
it's possible to create an AI or an AGI that does contain a balance of right and left brain

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:55.600
and and imbues more wisdom into the system or would that only happen after we changed

01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:02.080
the goals of the system away from unbridled economic growth any any thoughts there well

01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:09.600
I have a view that may be unpopular with some but is that when we talk of artificial intelligence

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:15.280
we're not really talking about intelligence at all we're talking about a following of certain

01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:24.400
procedures that gives a simulacrum of intelligence but is not intelligence and and in some sense

01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:33.040
that is important because I don't think that ever-increasing sophistication of AI

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:41.680
will will help us because it can never be wise it for that it would have to have a body it would

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:48.080
have to have emotions it would have to be a truly social being it would have to have empathy it

01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:54.720
would have to have suffered I don't want to be consoled by an AI mechanism created by some clever

01:22:54.720 --> 01:23:00.320
psychology that talks me through a crisis because I want to know that the person I'm talking to

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:06.000
is a fellow member of humanity that has suffered as I suffer and knows that I know that I'm going to

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:14.320
die so I think that is a dead end for what we need um what I worry it will do is make us think

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:21.920
that it's intelligent and give it more credence than it should get and even if that doesn't happen

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:28.000
what is very worrying is that we are seeing people and even talking more and more like

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.320
machines we're seeing people as machines we're becoming more like machines the language in

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:41.360
which we talk about human functions is now the language of AI one's data banks and uploading

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.920
things and in one's mind you know um and because we're in everyday life forced to interact with

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:54.320
incredibly stupid mechanisms that are on the internet I mean the people who used to ring up

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:59.600
to solve a problem weren't Einstein they probably had a fairly low IQ but in five minutes they could

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:06.320
sort out understand exactly what you wanted and get it done now you can spend not only a morning

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:12.240
but I've discovered trying to get one thing changed on Amazon a whole team of us have spent

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.480
nearly eight weeks trying to get it fixed and it's very simple we can we can do all this

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:27.600
you know clever stuff like create a robot that looks somewhat like a kind of an abortion of a

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:33.040
human being but nonetheless we can't do simple stuff and that has an immense impact on daily life

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.840
I know I haven't got much time left to live but an unreasonable amount of it is taken up in doing

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:46.000
procedural stuff that bulks now vastly greater in my life I mean I was just talking to my daughter

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.880
who is training as a psychotherapist and she's saying you know the trouble is I have to spend so

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:56.320
much time filling in things on the internet going on platforms doing this that and the other

01:24:56.320 --> 01:25:02.400
crikey when I was training there was absolutely none of that so we've got ourselves into a really

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:08.800
stupid corner it's artificial stupidity that is taking us over we don't it's artificial so we

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:15.120
don't have to obey it we need to embrace our own capacity for wisdom which is in bringing together

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:22.320
intuition and imagination not fantasy but true imagination to get you into the heart of reality

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:29.440
our only chance of doing so along with science and reason so sorry that was a bit of a bit of a

01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:35.040
splurge there but I think that you know it's important that we can't rely on AI for any of

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.320
these things and that the effort that goes into it would be much better put into things that are

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:47.920
quite practical that we could do so my contribution will be to no longer call it artificial intelligence

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:54.720
or AI but ASI artificial simulacrum intelligence there by naming the beast

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:09.440
so you mentioned imagination along with intuition and in one of your videos or something I read from

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:19.680
you how important is the need for the space to allow creativity in developing the health of an

01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:28.560
individual do you have any stories of that and how does allowing that space contrast with the

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:34.240
expectations and trajectories that we currently put on our youth especially in the United States

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:40.880
context where young people get into debt and get addicted and distracted and all that do you have

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:51.920
any stories or on the importance of imagination and creating space I do indeed you know it's often

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:59.520
said that science was very creative in the period between say the 20s and the 60s or 70s but since

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:04.400
then what has mainly happened is technological refinements rather than real breakthroughs in science

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:11.520
and what happened during that period very often was that people worked either alone or in small

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:17.920
groups of perhaps two or three people but mainly something like the Rand corporation took bright

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:27.840
people gave them an office and a desk and a salary and said do whatever it is that you think is

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:32.560
important to do and you know there's a risk involved in that but one of the problems with our

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:38.240
cultures are so risk averse and if you there is a risk that somebody will abuse it but if you

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:45.520
don't take that risk then we're on to hiding to nothing because nothing will come of micro managing

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:51.360
people towards an outcome if you take creative people and tell them they've got to publish a paper

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:56.000
every few months explaining what they're doing they will never reach the point from which they can

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:02.880
actually see a picture that coheres now I've been fortunate in that I've gone into various things

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.720
quite deeply but I've also been able to see the big picture and one of the reasons why is that in

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:14.320
all my education from my teams onwards I was allowed an enormous amount of freedom I was expected

01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:21.200
to work very hard at technical things at maths at you know at ancient languages and so on which

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.800
are not a piece of cake and that's fine that was part of my education but I was also left with an

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:33.120
immense amount of free time to read as I thought best and follow up things that I was being taught

01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.400
and that went on through university and eventually ended in my getting a kind of fellowship which

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:43.440
a version of which still exists but I think they're trying to make it more left hemisphere I'm

01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:48.080
afraid which is a fellowship a prize fellowship of all souls which you you got after sitting a

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:54.720
three-day exam if you were lucky and that gave me seven years and nobody insisted that I published

01:28:54.720 --> 01:29:00.160
anything in fact I did publish a book about five years or so into the fellowship or maybe it was a

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:06.400
bit longer than that and at the time I wondered what I was doing because I was following many

01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:11.200
things I followed science I went to philosophy seminars I found a teacher so that I could learn

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.240
Russian and it all kinds of things and then at the end of it I thought I needed to train in medicine

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:22.080
which I did and then in psychiatry and neuro psychiatry and all that so but that was because

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.320
I plowed a very unconventional furrow and the system was flexible enough to allow it I don't

01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:34.080
think that system is any longer so flexible I think people will want somebody to account for

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:39.600
themselves all the time now the thing that's important to know is that great scientists and

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:45.760
mathematicians of whom I cite many examples in in the matter with things you usually found out

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:52.480
the great discoveries after a fallow period in which they really were either at a dead end

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:57.040
or they'd stopped thinking about it and their mind had moved on to something else and then

01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:05.440
suddenly one day you know famously as as his foot you know landed on the bus the solution to

01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:13.920
vaccine equations came to um oh god I forgot my own name now but anyway you never have your

01:30:13.920 --> 01:30:22.320
primary so um this this freedom is really important and in retrospect for a long time I

01:30:22.320 --> 01:30:27.840
wondered perhaps I wasted that time but now I know that I didn't waste it because it enabled me to

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:35.200
write books that are both deeply grounded in the kind of technical stuff but also you know spacious

01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:42.320
enough to bring together psychology history anthropology you know with art and Persian

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:48.320
music and and so on and you know some people think that well that must mean that they don't

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:53.040
want to read it and they can't be any good because how can anybody you know seriously know anything

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:58.480
about all those things but fine I don't speaking to them I'm speaking to people who want to know

01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:05.520
something that's come from you know having a lot of free time to think it's not really free

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:12.480
in the sense of pointless or you know it's free in the sense that I can be the decider as to what I

01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:23.440
do so in a way though that's one linkage between your story and mine is the energy surplus of the

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:32.880
industrial revolution and late 20th century enabled someone like you to have the creativity in the

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:41.360
space to lay the foundations of writing two well three really because your last book is in two pieces

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:48.560
tomes on the human condition and the human brain which is kind of a product of energy surplus which

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:56.480
isn't going to be with us for long so this this is it this is our our species level moment to know

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:03.200
where to potentially know where we came from how we got here what we're doing what we really need

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:11.920
what the impacts are what is open to us in the future and it's it's both unbelievably tragic

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:18.240
and stunningly beautiful and profound at the same time you call it energy surplus which is very

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:26.240
much a way of thinking about it I understand that but what I would call it is a sophisticated

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:37.600
civilization the legacy of the Renaissance the Enlightenment Victorian hard work and that the

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:46.320
kind of institutions of now that are now busily trying to destroy their excellence that can provide

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:53.520
that um had it if you like you can call all civilization to do with a kind of energy surplus

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.440
that you know that was true in the Renaissance and so forth I understand that but it wasn't

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:04.320
to do with energy surplus in the sense that we mean since the industrial revolution it had very

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:09.680
little to do with that the kind of work I was encouraged to do and the kind of conversations I

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:15.680
was encouraged to have apart from the fact that they included up-to-date science were very much the

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:23.680
sort of continuation of a tradition of scholarship really and and we seem to have turned our backs

01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:30.080
on that except in some rather wonderful places where people are now starting up colleges that

01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:37.760
really are serious about learning in a broad sense and and and you know not just passing on

01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:43.600
propaganda but actually enabling people to think freely and in a balanced way about the predicament

01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:48.720
we find ourselves in so that's a good sign there are good signs I mean one of the things that really

01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:53.280
encourages me is the number of young people who write to me often scientists and say this stuff

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:58.640
that you're writing is so fantastic and I'm starting to do a project on this and can you

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:04.400
advise and so on which usually I can't but nonetheless the enthusiasm for it is extremely

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:11.040
important to me and gives me hope for the future I I agree with that I get I get similar

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:18.160
feedback all the time I want to be respectful of your time but I do have some some closing

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:23.280
questions that I ask all my viewers but before that a building on what you just said

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:32.800
how would you in a perfect world redesign the education system if if you were in charge

01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:40.240
so that you would take into account a lot of the the wisdom and and the science that you've

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:49.440
discovered over decades towards better preparing young human beings towards the future of the 21st

01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:57.920
century to be you know left brain right brain more balanced to be slower to spend time in nature

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:03.200
to meditate what would you do to change the education system because in my view the education

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:12.000
system itself has become a out of control super organism that feeds on its own demands etc well

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:22.240
in in in short I'd re humanize it and the emphasis only on stem subjects is a product of this

01:35:24.320 --> 01:35:31.600
feeling that we need to increase productivity but that will get us nowhere on its own we desperately

01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:40.720
need to have intelligent knowledgeable human beings who who are aware of the culture that to

01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:48.400
which they owe so much and are not taking a sledgehammer to it and and so I would reintroduce

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:57.440
the humanities including some emphasis on on music on drama on poetry and on philosophy in the sense

01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:02.240
that there are different ways in history of thinking about things and to see some of them

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.440
you'll think like this and to see others you'd think like that and thus broadening people's

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:13.440
horizons and seeing that there are you know there are often many sides to any one question I think

01:36:13.440 --> 01:36:20.000
that would be a very important thing I think that young people should be taught mindfulness

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:29.040
in school from an early age I think the whole rhetoric of mechanistic determinism should not

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:35.360
be the assumed model for the cosmos and that really means introducing I don't know how it

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:43.200
would best be done but something of spirituality again into the into the curriculum the exact

01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:49.680
thousand wherefores are not for me to stay but I think that that would be good I also think that

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:57.360
emphasis on the being right answers in exams rather than demonstrating intelligent thinking

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:07.120
you know that that should be played down you know there are ways in which you can be wrong

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:12.640
but have given a fantastically interesting answer to a question whereas somebody else who just

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:17.840
you know follows everyone else and says the right thing may have been very

01:37:17.840 --> 01:37:22.880
unintelligent in their response so I that's the way I'd look at it we need to be freer we need to

01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:28.400
trust we need to trust teachers for god's sake we need to trust university lectures we need to

01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:34.160
trust doctors we need to you know we we shouldn't be telling them all the time how to do that

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:39.520
let's managerialize out of existence I mean who'd want to be a teacher now who'd want to be a doctor

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:46.640
you know it is a reality that started in the in the in the 80s that managers started to tell

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:51.360
doctors how to do their job well and and there are more of them now than the doctors and they're

01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:56.720
better paid than the doctors and their culture is a nonsense because it you know it's not the

01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.680
culture that you work extremely hard to have the experience and knowledge of a doctor can be and

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.720
the same is true of a teacher a teacher makes a gift of a relationship with a child the people

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:11.760
who really taught me anything we're on fire with the thing is that it that inspired them and they

01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:16.080
communicated that spark to me and it might not have been on the curriculum but I will remember

01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:22.960
it all my life we've turned the planet into a business as a species and I agree with you regarding

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:29.520
teaching I may have no money at all but it was the most rewarding thing I've ever done with these

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:39.440
17 18 19 year olds um yeah ancient wisdom from my understanding in India have long known about the

01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:48.960
brain hemispheres just a penultimate question here from a western medical and psychological

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:55.520
perspective are there specific practices recommended for rebalancing the hemispheres you

01:38:55.520 --> 01:39:03.360
mentioned a few of them earlier but could the wisdom of the eastern religions you mentioned

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:09.280
Taoism Buddhism be integrated with the modern imbalance of the west and how would that come

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:15.440
about well absolutely the people just need to acquaint themselves with this and at school I

01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:21.040
got to know Heraclitus and I thought he was far more interesting than Plato and then about 20 I

01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:28.080
read Alan Watts's Tao the watercourse way and that reconnected me with the pre-socratic philosophers

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:35.360
like Heraclitus and it was another you know life-changing moment when I read that book and

01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:41.600
since then Taoism has always been part of my thinking so people people can start by picking up books

01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:49.120
but it's not about reading a book it's like you can't learn to swim by reading a book about it you

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:56.640
need to get in the water and do it and you can't actually experience what people mean by religious

01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:02.720
religious life by simply reading about it you have to start committing yourself to something

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:10.160
so that's a very important insight on how this sort of thing works but what I would say is that

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.800
I've mentioned already things like mindfulness which is almost the clearest example I can give

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:24.480
of recruiting the right hemisphere and trying to silence the ever chattering ever judgmental

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:32.800
left hemisphere and allowing things as Heidegger says to presence before us rather than simply be

01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:39.680
represented in our minds so that's a good thing and the arts in general as I say but also leading a

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:45.440
certain kind of life and the ambition to lead that life being put into children at school

01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:51.040
and it's not a fix it's not something they can get tomorrow but they need to begin to start the

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:56.640
steps on a journey that will be a lifelong journey that will take them ever deeper into a

01:40:56.640 --> 01:41:03.040
country they need to know and where they belong so it's about it's about changing the way we

01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:06.640
think about everything's got to be a quick fix and there's got to be an answer and a test to

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:10.720
make sure people have got it and all that but that is really beside what I'm talking about

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:20.800
I just want to say can I say add this that it's not just it's not just the eastern religions that

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:25.760
seem to show an understanding of the relationship between the hemispheres and I quote you know the

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:31.280
Daodu Jing and and I quote the Yi Qing and all these things in the book because they have

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.440
extraordinary insights into the relationship between the hemispheres as soon as you know about

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.920
you can see that they intuited this without having brain scanners but the most remarkable

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:49.520
example is a story by the Onondaga people who are part of the Iroquois nation and I tell it at

01:41:50.240 --> 01:41:55.360
you know some length it's the first six pages of part three of the book it's absolutely staggering

01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:00.480
I can't tell it now but these people intuited exactly the relationship between the hemispheres

01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:06.000
and what was going to happen when the the brother as they call the two brothers with one brother who

01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:10.880
doesn't know as much as the other when that brother starts to take control so I mean they saw they

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:18.080
foresaw all of this anyway sorry that was just an addendum to my answer homo sapiens clever but

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:26.880
seldom wise um so you've you've talked about culture and you've talked about from the perspective

01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:34.320
of education system but what about young humans specifically do you have any recommendations

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:42.880
for 18 to 25 year old human beings around the world who are aware of climate change and resource

01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:48.720
depletion and polarization in our economy and the constraints to the human enterprise that are

01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:53.920
listening to this and nodding their heads agreeing with the wisdom that you're sharing what what

01:42:53.920 --> 01:43:02.240
advice do you have for young humans not to be afraid to trust their intuitions but to question them

01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:08.080
as you question everything everything you're told without necessarily that leading to your

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:17.440
dismissing it but just making sure that you've seen both sides of everything um taking strength from

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:26.640
a spiritual tradition knowing the works in it belonging to it nourishing your soul at

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:37.920
the fount of art and music dedicating yourself to practical good works either locally or as part

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:43.600
of an organization that you admire as long as you still are in it and continue to admire it

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:50.560
there can come a time when you may decide it happens so often in institutions as it's become

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:57.840
more of a barrier to achieving its original aim than it is promoting it as William James said

01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:12.160
already in the 19th century um uh not necessarily believing everything that experts tell you but

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.440
at least while you're young thinking it's quite a good idea to listen to what experts say about this

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:28.080
um with time you may see what you can you know what of that that quote wisdom was really wisdom

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:36.240
and what wasn't and and act appropriately believe in the power of humanity to surprise us

01:44:36.560 --> 01:44:46.960
you know there was homo habilis and there is homo sapiens clever homo wise homo and you know

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:54.480
we are supposed to do that homo sapiens but we have it in us to be wise in a way that no other

01:44:54.480 --> 01:45:03.840
creature can be wise that wisdom is the product of hard work long self-discipline and immersion

01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:13.120
in the glorious business of life and it lies the other side of knowledge so there's ignorance on

01:45:13.120 --> 01:45:19.120
one side of knowledge and there's a kind of unknowing which is wise on the other side and it has

01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:26.320
nothing to do with ignorance it's where you are in the position to be wise and so all of these

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:31.920
things are part of a long narrative that may be frustrating to a young person who wants

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:39.200
wisdom now but wisdom cannot be had now but you won't get it unless you make the investments in it

01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:45.600
now so the start of life is making investments in becoming a certain kind of person over time

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:52.400
and society should encourage those steps and not say the only way forward for you is to work in some

01:45:52.400 --> 01:46:02.320
vast organization in which you have no no say no no ability to use your own initiative I think we

01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:08.720
should you know look at it organizations and a healthy one is one in which as far as possible

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:14.000
initiative and freedom to act are passed down the tree there's got to be some upper control I

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:19.360
understand that but as far as possible to let people manage intelligently what they're dealing with

01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:25.840
and be answerable for it and be dismissed if they've done a bad job but to take part in a life which

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:32.400
is not just being embedded in the kind of organizations that now so many people will end up going into

01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.920
and and you know dare to be different but it's going to be hard work you know I dared to be

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:42.240
different I gave up a promising academic career in order to start being a medical student when I

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:47.360
was in my early 30s and already had a couple of children under the age of three so I didn't know

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.160
whether I was more insomniac when I was working 120 hours a week in the hospital which in those days

01:46:52.160 --> 01:47:00.400
was legal it isn't now or at home so you know you live dangerously I've lived dangerously but you

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:06.320
also need to work very very hard but if you can be prepared to work hard be honest to yourself be

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:14.560
honorable to yourself and to others to be to be you know inspired by by some goal that seems you

01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:23.600
real and valuable that is a loving goal not just a selfish goal then go for it go for it and you

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:29.840
know may god be with you that's all I can say and I hope you will because you know the future depends

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:37.040
on people like you doing that I always dared to be different but I'm in my mid 50s right now and

01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:45.040
I'm firstly now investing in the things that will bring me wisdom and I wish I had started that 30

01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:54.480
years ago when I was in my 20s I was I was much more left-brained yeah no I believe that what

01:47:54.480 --> 01:48:01.680
do you care most about in the world Ian? It's a very difficult thing to to say because I

01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:08.240
I just care about the world really you know but I care about it under the aspect of love

01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:18.240
I care about real love continuing and prospering and spreading

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:26.320
I can't say better than that that's ultimately what life's about you can do anything you can be

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:33.920
anything but if you don't experience love and you don't do in your own way what seems to you

01:48:33.920 --> 01:48:41.360
to be the loving thing then I'm not sure what point life has I'm sounding a bit like some fool here

01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:47.280
never a man I particularly have found on my wavelength but there we are but I'm sure he was

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:56.080
very wise and right about many things. Is love a product of both the left and right hemispheres?

01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:00.320
It's much bigger than either hemisphere it comes from somewhere very deep

01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:06.640
below the hemispheres I believe and it takes the whole body and it takes the whole of the

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:14.960
embodied being their heart their gut literally and their brain their soul their spirit their

01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:28.880
intelligence their everything. If you could wave a magic wand even though we know those don't exist

01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:36.240
and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one thing one thing that you would do to

01:49:36.240 --> 01:49:46.720
improve human and planetary futures? It is again almost impossible to say

01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:56.240
and one of the reasons this is of course it can't happen and one's constrained by what can happen but

01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:12.720
I think bringing back into our lives that those things that I talked about of humility and and

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:20.560
or if people could be made to experience those things on the daily basis if scientists could

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:27.280
realize that they don't know so very much it's wonderful that they know what they know and that

01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:34.160
I'm with them every inch of the way in the work that it's done but that really as William James said

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:43.280
ignorance is an ocean what we know is just a drop and that you know that that's how we are and if

01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.960
if we had that sense before the world and we had the sense of awe and wonder in it we would behave

01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:57.040
well to it and to one another in that aspect of love that I've described that's all I can say.

01:50:57.920 --> 01:51:06.000
So are you still writing is this going to be a trilogy maybe the last book will be how the

01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:19.040
emissary relinquished the things? I won't be doing any more big books I don't have the energy

01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:24.880
all the time but I might write a few short books I've just been reminded yesterday by Oxford

01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:30.640
University Press that I promised them a book many years ago which would be a kind of intellectual

01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:39.520
autobiography I hope a short one I'd quite like to write a short book of things I'd like to say to

01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:46.880
my younger self or to people who are growing now about the world and it will have no footnotes

01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:52.640
and no bibliography and it will be no more than a hundred pages probably much less

01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:57.440
and the other thing I've promised for a long time to write and I would very much enjoy is a

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:04.480
book on the art created by psychotic subjects I've collected some from patients of mine I

01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:10.880
was fortunate enough to work at the Bethlehem Royal Hospital the most ancient mental hospital in the

01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:17.200
world founded in the late 14th century and it has a magnificent museum of works done by

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:24.240
some of its patients some of them quite well known and I've always found it utterly fascinating

01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:28.240
and I'd like to write a relatively short monograph illustrated with some of these works

01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:36.000
because I think people would find it intriguing as I do this has been a great conversation

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:42.400
it's been inspiring to me and I'm glad that we met after all this time and and hope we can

01:52:42.400 --> 01:52:48.160
continue a conversation thank you for your lifetime of work and and for your time today

01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:56.960
Dr. Ian McElchrist thank you very much Nate and I too have found it thoroughly enjoyable talking
