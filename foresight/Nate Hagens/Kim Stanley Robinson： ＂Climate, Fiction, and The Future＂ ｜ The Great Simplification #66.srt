1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
Joining me today is Kim Stanley Robinson, a very well-known science fiction author.

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,280
I've long thought that we need to better communicate science to the general public,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,480
but in a way that uses art and literature to be able to change the mental landscapes

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,680
of an individual human mind. Stan has been publishing science fiction novels for almost

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,040
40 years now. He's a leading figure in climate fiction writing. Stan incorporates strong influences

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,840
of ecological, cultural, and political themes and features scientists as the heroes in his work.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,720
Many of you have heard or read his most recent novel, Ministry for the Future,

8
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,480
which has been highly praised for the illumination of possible near-term climate impacts

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:01,280
and how imagining such an issue might change our responses to what we face. How can we incorporate

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,840
fiction into our set of tools to bring more people into awareness of the pressing system dynamics that

11
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,320
underpin global human events? This was a very interesting conversation. I hope you enjoyed it.

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,880
Please welcome Kim Stanley Robinson.

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,920
Hello, Stan. Hey there, Nate. Great to see you.

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,760
Yes, good to see you too. So you, let's dive right into it. I've long known of your name,

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,840
because I've read some of your books long ago, but you've kind of been thrust into a broader

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:55,200
spotlight because of our cultural awareness of climate change and your recent very popular book

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,160
Ministry for the Future, which kind of took a view in the future of accelerating climate damage

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:09,680
to society. You've long been an environmentalist. How did you decide that fiction writing was the

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,520
way that you wanted to get involved and contribute to these issues?

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,520
Well, for me, the fiction writing came first. So the environmentalism came later. I was a

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,360
reader as a kid. I grew up in a suburbia in Southern California. I was a beach kid. I did love the

22
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,160
beach with all my heart, but I didn't think of it as anything but getting out of suburbia into

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,800
something more fun. And then I was an English major. I loved all literature, but the novel sort

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,040
of takes precedence in my reading life and in the world at large these days when it comes to

25
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,760
literature, maybe not compared to screenplays. Anyway, I got into science fiction because it

26
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,400
seemed like the best way of conveying the way my reality felt, which was Southern California

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,400
turning from orange grows into city extremely rapidly. And so science fiction struck a chord

28
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:19,200
with me and I wrote it. That's my start. And then I started going to this year in Nevada when I was

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:28,320
an undergraduate in college and that mountain consciousness was pretty all-encompassing. It

30
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:35,600
reoriented my lowland life to be always thinking about the mountains, my love of the mountains.

31
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,920
What did that mean? What were the threats involved? And I began to notice that California in general

32
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:50,720
is what you could seriously call a terraformed space. The waters distributed by unnatural means.

33
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:59,200
It's an irrigated landscape. It's now urban, but also ag. It made me pay attention. And then

34
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:07,360
by that time the environmental movement was really an active thing in the world,

35
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,400
pointing out the dangers that even preceded our awareness of climate change. And then climate

36
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,280
change was just the, how can you say it, the exponential growth of an environmental consciousness.

37
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,920
And it began to invade my science fiction. Anytime I set a story in the next 100 years or two or

38
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,760
almost anywhere, the climate and the environment were prominent players in the story. So that's how

39
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:43,520
it came about for me. And what's been your experience? Have you found your works, your books to be

40
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,880
effective in educating or swaying people? No, not until the ministry for the future.

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,240
I can say that my books were considered, oh, well, you know, that's Stan, he's our Boy Scout,

42
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,400
he's our nature guy. Science fiction community likes to be ecumenical and welcoming to

43
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:12,000
all kinds of viewpoints. And in the great world of the science fiction community,

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,120
it's a melting pot where no matter what your politics or your interests, you can be taken in

45
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,040
with open arms. So that was the attitude towards me. And in the larger world, I had my readers.

46
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:34,000
But and truthfully, I mean, to be more serious about it, as time passed, it became obvious that I was

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
a leading proponent of climate fiction, which was near future science fiction,

48
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,960
paying attention to the over determining reality of climate change. So in other words,

49
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,520
all nearest future science fiction had to turn into climate fiction to be at all realistic or

50
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,120
relevant. And so it wasn't just the ministry for the future itself, like from zero to 60. But

51
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:11,200
in a growing sense of where I was in the cultural conversation, and New York 2140 was a big step

52
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,520
in that way with its sea level rise and its climate finance, ministry still nevertheless has

53
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,760
joined the or how can I say it, it's it's blown up my life, but it's joined the world

54
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,200
conversation in a way that none of my books ever have before. So I wonder if you had written that

55
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,480
exact same book 20 years ago, if it would have been far, you know, equally well written, if it

56
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:42,640
would have been far less well received, just because the public awareness of climate still

57
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:49,680
wasn't the way it is now where we have events and things that people recognize are out of the normal.

58
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,480
I think that can be a that's almost certainly true. Yes. And we have a small thought experiment

59
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:05,760
that shows how true it is. I published 40 signs of rain in I think 2004. And I want to say that 40

60
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:11,520
signs of rain is not as good at novel as ministry for the future. It's it's confined to Washington,

61
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:18,000
DC to the National Science Foundation. It's an attempt to go local. But because the local was

62
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,520
Washington, DC, that was its supposed international aspect, you know, capital of the world and all

63
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,560
that. But National Science Foundation is not a powerful agency. It was a bit of a joke on my

64
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:37,920
part. I I struggled to convey Washington, DC, and the federal bureaucracy in a novel. And

65
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:44,480
my struggles were, I think, evident on the page. But it was also 2004. And this was just an odd

66
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,640
thing to be interested in then. And I must say Al Gore's in In Can Me In Truth came out almost

67
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:57,360
the same week as my novel. And it did have an impact. So that was partly Al Gore, partly movie,

68
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,280
partly a better demonstration of the severity of the problem than my novel. Nevertheless,

69
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,440
if I had if the if the book I had put out then had been ministry, it wouldn't have gotten the

70
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,320
same attention that it got in 2020.

71
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,680
Just a brief personal question. Did you win like writing awards in your high school English

72
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,560
classes? And were you always like going home and writing short stories and stuff? Or is this

73
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,760
something that evolved into a passion and skill over time?

74
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:34,320
In high school, I loved Shakespeare and poetry and detective novels. And there weren't any prizes

75
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,000
to be had, except for one, my English teacher, Mrs Catherine Lee, a sweetheart, a complete anglophile,

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,200
an elderly woman who seemed of a previous age to us, because I'm talking the late 60s here.

77
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:57,200
And she was probably had her, her looks and her mind formed in the 1930s. So she's probably

78
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,320
was quite a bit younger than I am now, but we considered her to be ancient. But she was lovely.

79
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:08,320
She paid attention. She liked it that I like literature. We were like the two literature

80
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:14,400
lovers in the entirety of Orange County, as far as we could tell. And so she was fond of me.

81
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:21,440
It's amazing how high school memories like that are imprinted on our amygdala.

82
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,120
My high school English teacher Rita Mack, I specifically can see the pen writing blah,

83
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:38,560
boring in red ink on some of my papers. So more broadly, with writing and fiction, etc.,

84
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,920
how important do you think art is, broadly speaking, versus science in our current kind

85
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,320
of poly crisis situation? It's a good question and a hard one. And I'm not

86
00:09:52,640 --> 00:10:00,160
good at answering it because I'm kind of inside my own bubble looking out into the world from a

87
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,880
particular perspective. I'd say it's the sciences that are making all the stuff that keep us alive

88
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,720
and telling us how the world works. And this is the science dominated world or science created

89
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:21,280
world. But then the science at its straightest, where it's really being honest with itself and

90
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:29,200
with everything else, and notice I'm personifying it, is modest in this way. It says we're learning

91
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,080
about the world. We're creating some power over the world. We're not going to tell you what to do

92
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:40,720
with it. That's the job of everybody else. And so they give over, many scientists will just say,

93
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,320
look, this is society's job or this is the work for philosophy. And so there the arts and humanities

94
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,640
come in. What do we do with our new powers? How do we get along with each other? These are not

95
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:02,400
scientific questions. These are humanities questions. And so the arts can come in to tell the story

96
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:11,440
and to create a sense of meaning. And so that is important. It's vaguer and it's also like a

97
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,960
giant echo chamber that we're all inside where everybody's yammering all at once. So in other

98
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:27,200
words, it's quite incoherent. But it is important. Well, I would argue that art is more important,

99
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,960
but it has to be informed by the correct system science. And a lot of our, like you said,

100
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,440
everyone's kind of yammering in the same chamber. A core message in ministry of the future is that

101
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:46,320
civilization has to trust in science. But I wonder what version of science, because economic,

102
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,320
which in my opinion is not a science, is overlaid on top of climate science and gives in my opinion

103
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,480
quite inappropriate roadmaps of the future. In effect, there are no integrated assessment models

104
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,640
that show a decline in growth from today to the year 2100. What do you think of that?

105
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:16,000
Well, I'm with you on that. I think economics is a quantified ethics or a power politics disguised

106
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,160
as a science. So it's an instrument of power to run some numbers and say, we'll do this because of

107
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,640
these reasons, because it makes economic sense. I would divide it, it is a social science and it

108
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:36,160
uses scientific tools. It could be more useful than it is. If you think of it as being something like

109
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,520
geometry where there are theorems, but the theorems are decided based on axioms, then economics needs

110
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:50,640
to go back to the axioms. What are we doing it for? If it's for human welfare and also the welfare

111
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:58,480
of the rest of the biosphere over the long haul, then those axioms would drive the economic

112
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,960
calculations and we would get different rubrics than profit or shareholder value, which are

113
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:11,840
ridiculous rubrics, gross domestic product, ridiculous. And even this word you use growth,

114
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:19,920
when it's used in economics, its meanings are peculiar and various and unhelpful. We need

115
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,240
the poorest people on the planet to live at adequacy, so that's some kind of growth. We don't

116
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:32,000
need the richest people on the planet to get richer, which I have consistently since the 1980s,

117
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,680
but especially during the pandemic, where something like 70% of the quantitative easing value

118
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,760
created in the pandemic to keep the economy going was captured by the top 2% of wealthy people.

119
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,840
Well, not only that, I often ask what is the carbon footprint of quantitative easing,

120
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:57,520
something that people don't ask that question. True. Well, this is an economics question that

121
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,920
gets delinked from physical systems questions like you ask, and so economics is ridiculous in

122
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:10,640
that sense also. It's not rating biosphere impacts, those were used to be negative externalities,

123
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,520
they weren't even included at all. Now they're attempting to include them, but things like the

124
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:23,680
discount rate or the various wiggles that currently enacted, which is to say legal and powerful

125
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:32,800
economic systems, they are still very poorly aligned to people and planet. So it is something

126
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,920
that I talk about, and the fact the discussion of it in Ministry for the Future is one of the

127
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,720
reasons that the book has struck people's imagination, that economics could be changed,

128
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,400
that it could be aimed better, that it could be recalibrated, and that it could be

129
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:56,160
something like the carbon coin, which I would say is a kind of a symbol for power and money being

130
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,640
redirected to the public good and to biosphere health. Well, people were encouraged by that,

131
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,720
they were interested, they were thinking, oh, you know, it's possible to change.

132
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:15,680
That was one of my few criticisms or not criticisms, but points of interest in ministry

133
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:22,400
that you wrote about a pro-social, pro-environmental behavior that sequesters carbon would be rewarded

134
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:29,280
with a carbon coin. But I wondered, in such a society, if you do things and you're rewarded

135
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:36,000
with a carbon coin, then don't you in turn just go and spend it on other things that create or

136
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:46,240
contain indirect carbon? Yes, I think that's valid, and it is a problem. I guess I've been

137
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,640
thinking about this since you've communicated with me before this and pondering it, and I guess

138
00:15:52,640 --> 00:16:02,960
I would say the book is a little cautious in that it tries to propose methods we could use

139
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,280
right now that are not completely shocking, that they're legal. You could imagine them getting

140
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:17,040
passed by central banks and legislatures, and so it's Keynesian. Keynesianism is not radical,

141
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,000
nor is it particularly biosphere friendly. It is a standard economic system where the government

142
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:31,440
actually stimulates the economy in times of distress, like a depression, and that stimulus is

143
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,560
indeed what you're talking about. More carbon ultimately will be burned. If carbon burning

144
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:45,840
is fundamental to the system working, then by keeping it healthy, you're burning more carbon.

145
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:56,400
Yes, but the carbon coin, if it's an adjusted right, then you bring down a ton of CO2 from the

146
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:05,200
atmosphere. Hopefully the creation of the, what can I say, the needs and the wants, the necessities

147
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:12,800
and the toys will be more clean energy created than they were before, so the decarbonization effort

148
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:19,840
would extend to decarbonizing our energy systems, our transport systems. All of those would receive

149
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:26,000
carbon coins, and slowly but surely, even though you might have a quite active and productive

150
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,720
society and civilization and economic system, it at least would be decarbonized.

151
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,120
It wouldn't solve the other problems, and because there's no single solution here, and indeed my

152
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,040
novel talks a lot about biosphere corridors, wildlife corridors. What now is being called the

153
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:50,160
30 by 30 plans, they weren't even quite being discussed when I wrote the book in 2019, and yet

154
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,720
now they're the law of the land because of this Montreal Treaty and because of the Ocean Treaty.

155
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,880
Well, this is astonishing rapid progress on that front, and that's different than,

156
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,480
that's different than economics, that's land use. It has an economic aspect to it, but again,

157
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,560
it's part of, it's not exactly decarbonization, except it does draw down carbon if you leave

158
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,880
wild land alone, but it's more having to do with biosphere health and having the wild animals

159
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,840
not go extinct, so it is a big project. Let me extend that a little bit.

160
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,000
I would argue that decarbonization, the way it's being promoted now is going to lead to a

161
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,400
rematerialization, especially in the global south, and negative impacts on global ecologies in the

162
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,200
countries where there's going to be massive copper and lithium and cobalt mining, etc.

163
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:52,640
So I wonder if you extend the metaphor of the carbon coin in your book to be an ecology coin,

164
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,600
things that are not only optimized for climate, but that are optimized for biosphere health,

165
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,280
writ large, much wider boundary. I wonder if that would, I mean, part of the problem here

166
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,280
is we're trying to optimize so many variables at once, but what do you think about that to

167
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,560
extend it to a broader ecology coin? Well, I've certainly heard about this since my book came out

168
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:27,920
in ways that are super interesting. There were people who are studying the fact that you can

169
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:35,760
tell what's alive in a, in a biome, in a watershed by taking a water sample out of its streams and

170
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:44,080
testing for DNA, and those tests have gotten so good and fine-tuned that you can tell everything

171
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,080
that is alive in that watershed, and then you get a credit for it. Wait, you can just do a DNA test

172
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:56,960
and it shows the species that live in that watershed? Yes. I didn't know that. Well, it's the ETH,

173
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,360
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, is doing some work on this, and I can put you in

174
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,040
contact with the people who are both studying that, and also could that be turned into a form

175
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,320
of credit for the people living in that watershed? So this would be what you were describing, a kind

176
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,760
of biosphere coin, that you would get renumerated or you would get, instead of destroying your

177
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,760
watershed, extracting things and selling it for profit in the old economy, you would begin to be

178
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,160
able to make your living by taking care of your watershed and keeping a whole lot of creatures

179
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,240
alive in it, which you can prove they're alive by this water test of the DNA. Well, it's new and

180
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,680
interesting. I'm totally in favor, long term, of something like that, and all these discussions,

181
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:47,280
I think there's two questions. Where do we want to go, and what's sustainable, and how do we get

182
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,640
there from here? And those are two different questions, but if we could have people making a

183
00:20:52,640 --> 00:21:00,640
living by doing things that are healthy for the ecology, isn't that a much better use of a Keynesian

184
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,680
stimulus than just supporting people to buy flat screen TVs and take junket trips or whatever it

185
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:15,680
is, just the consumption as usual? That's the cultural shift that I think could happen, would

186
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,000
be a fantasy to happen, but I'm hopeful for in coming decades. Seems to me that what you're

187
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:31,280
talking about is also that it's not economic, but it's more experiential or philosophical,

188
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:39,280
or even a religious sensibility. In other words, what's life for? And many of us, and the way that

189
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,320
you live your life, to a certain extent the way I live my life, although I'm a very conventional

190
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,200
suburban guy still, but it's more interesting to do things than it is to watch things being done.

191
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:00,160
This, of course, is a stab to the heart of our current cultural imaginary of

192
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:06,080
social media and watching things on screens, a whole generational problem of your smart

193
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,800
form, your laptop screen, your big wall TV, watching things. And then other people do them,

194
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:21,520
and you watch them. This is so sapping of human spirit. It's so passive and observational.

195
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,480
It's like a half-life. It's like a Philip K. Dick half-life. And many people

196
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,240
live it because they haven't figured out that even just taking a walk down the lane to the

197
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,640
local store would be more interesting than what they were doing, or throwing pebbles at a bottle

198
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,600
on top of a fence top would be more interesting than these incredibly complicated computer games

199
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,400
being played on a flat screen. The third dimension, bodily life in the real world,

200
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:56,880
this is all more interesting than our artificial created advertising culture. So when people will

201
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,640
get that, how people will get that, whether that becomes a general sensibility, I don't know.

202
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,800
To me, it's as obvious as walking outdoors to other people, obviously not so much. So I don't

203
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,480
know exactly how to make that turn. One thing I'll say is that my books are always about people

204
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,680
doing stuff outdoors in the world. And maybe that's why my Washington DC novel was such a

205
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,000
trial for me and for its readers. There were too many meetings and offices.

206
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,120
Didn't you write one of your recent books fully while you were outside? I think I heard that

207
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,960
somewhere. Oh, that's true for my last books since I finished that DC trilogy. I'm starting

208
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,720
with Galileo's Dream, or even the last book of my DC trilogy. But for sure, Galileo's Dream

209
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,360
in every book since, so that's about seven or eight books now I've written entirely outdoors.

210
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,760
Now I'm in California, and in the winter I bundle up, in the summer I put a mister on. It can be

211
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,720
cold, it can be hot. I have a tarp overhead, so the rain just falls around me when there is rain.

212
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,000
And I work outdoors no matter what, very stubbornly, because it turned my writing into a little outdoor

213
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,960
adventure. And it saved my brain. I was a burned out case at that point, and now I'm very energized.

214
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:19,680
That's awesome. So you are a very busy person, Stan. This podcast has been scheduled for four

215
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:26,240
months. After we hang up later, are you going to go outside and write? Are you writing a novel now?

216
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,200
I'm not writing a novel now, and I'm antsy and feeling unhappy about it.

217
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,000
But the Ministry for the Future has kind of eaten my life, and I'm currently like the cardboard cut

218
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,160
out of the minister. I do a lot of events like this. And it's okay. I'm going to write a non-fiction

219
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:52,960
book about Antarctica. So I'm quite excited about that. Have you been there? I have. I've been twice.

220
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:04,240
So the first time was in 1995, and then I went again in 2016. I loved it. It was a big adventure.

221
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,120
A little strand of memoir will be in this book, just like in my Sierra book, where it was a big

222
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,640
strand. But in my Sierra book, I've been going to the Sierras for 50 years, and I've only gone

223
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,320
twice. So that strand will be small. But there'll be history, geology, and a little bit more about

224
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,400
this future plan of slowing the glaciers down so that we save sea level.

225
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,320
So in ministry, you incorporate chapters from mostly unspecified, non-human, non-living perspectives.

226
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,200
Why did you decide to incorporate these different perspectives, and what was your thought process

227
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,080
while writing them and trying to get into the mindset of these creatures or entities?

228
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:54,720
Well, thank you for that. I really enjoyed doing ministry as a kind of a miscellany, an anthology

229
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:03,360
of different styles, and genres, and modes, and character types. So this is actor network theory

230
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:10,560
out of Brunelatur, that our lives include very important contributions by creatures that aren't

231
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:18,480
human. The animals in your life, the microbiota inside your gut, these are actors in your

232
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,720
mentation and your life. And to write about that is a thing that literature ought to be doing

233
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,240
that it hasn't done enough of, because it's somewhat of a new perception. So I was thoroughly enjoying

234
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,680
that, and Anglo-Saxon literature can fit into one thick volume, all that we have left of it,

235
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:42,880
and about a third of that volume is riddles. So I enjoyed having riddles of, oh, well,

236
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,880
I am the thing that is always in control, but I never do anything. And so these riddle modes

237
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,800
were fun for me. I also very much enjoyed the eyewitness account, which I began to understand

238
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:02,320
as a new genre of its own that is not like fiction proper. The eyewitness account, you're usually

239
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:08,720
being interviewed, it's like 10 years later, you don't dramatize the scene, you go really fast,

240
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,520
and you judge what happened, what it meant to you and your life, what it meant to the world.

241
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,800
So the eyewitness account is interesting, and there are bundles of them. There are books of all

242
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:24,320
the things that women saw on their way on the Oregon Trail, or all of the things that happened

243
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:32,800
in Germany in April of 1945, or the French Revolution, etc., etc. It's a mode of history,

244
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:40,240
and when I realized I could do that for my future in ministry, it freed me up. And so it's not just

245
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:47,040
a photon or a carbon atom, or the sun that I have speaking in the first person, it's also individual

246
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,200
humans that you never learn their name, they never come back again, but they tell you something

247
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,200
interesting that they saw and did, and that for me was the key that turned the lock. I was happy.

248
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,720
So Stan, I recently did a podcast with climate modeling expert, Erica Thompson,

249
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,280
where we discussed the idea that models in general can go way beyond computer

250
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:18,560
programings, including the form of novels. So do you feel like the books that you write are a sort

251
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:27,520
of mental model of the potential futures that you see that allow a human, even if they don't

252
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,400
know the science or haven't taken a science course, it helps them construct a mental model?

253
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:40,720
Yes, absolutely. I often compare it to modeling exercises, but then what you would want is to

254
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,640
take the whole spread of science fiction stories and say each one is one run through from the

255
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:53,360
initial conditions to a different outcome, like in any modeling exercise scenarios, it's good to

256
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,320
compare them to scenario building. And the thing I would say that the novel brings to it, that the

257
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,520
others don't have, and there are things the others have that novels don't. But what novels bring,

258
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:13,680
some people call thick texture. And I think it's also just a time involvement and a giving of,

259
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,600
a generous giving of time on the part of the reader who has to imagine those sentences on the page

260
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,320
into some kind of internal lived experience. That takes effort, that takes hours. And when you're

261
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,280
done, you feel like you've kind of lived it. If the novel has worked well, you feel like you've

262
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:37,200
been there, done that, it's a time travel, it's telepathy, it's quite a magical thing, but it's

263
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,560
all in the reader's head. And so it's a modeling exercise with some heft to it, because you've

264
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:49,920
been there for a while and you've kind of lived it. So you've often spoken about narratives,

265
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:55,040
especially speculative fiction as a powerful tool to envision

266
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,600
positive change in the world. However, and despite its transformative intentions,

267
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:13,200
a lot of clarify climate fiction so far has been dystopian. And there has been science showing

268
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,120
that dystopia tends to reinforce the resignation to negative events, climate catastrophe, etc.

269
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,960
What are your thoughts on that? I think that's right. And I think it's a really serious problem.

270
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:35,120
I have become anti dystopian as a utopian science fiction writer. I've always had to acknowledge

271
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,080
that these are two sides of a coin. Utopia dystopia, things could get better, things could get worse.

272
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,360
It's dialectical, they both have their value in imagining. They're like the modeling exercises

273
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,800
we just talked about, and you'd need negative models to convince you don't go that way. So

274
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:02,000
dystopia has always had its use. Susan famously 1984 is a classic case of people saying they didn't

275
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,240
want to go to the land of big brother and false information, which maybe we've ended up at anyway.

276
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,480
But back to dystopias, there are now a kind of a comfort food. People read them or watch them on

277
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:20,080
TV in order to feel like superior, like, well, things may be bad for me, but at least they're

278
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,560
not that bad. And so you come away from them comforted. Is that why the the evening news at

279
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,120
6pm, they always lead with all these bad things happening in the world and my mom is obsessed

280
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,080
with watching the six o'clock news and it's all terrible? Because people, it makes them feel better

281
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,640
about their current situation? Yes, I worry about that. But also, if it bleeds, it leads. When it's

282
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,760
TV news, you need something that you can look at. So it can't be facts, it can't be a report,

283
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,240
it has to be visual and you have to have been able to capture it at that moment. So it's always

284
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:01,200
the aftermath of a crime, red lights, police tape, and a reporter outside going, oh, how horrible,

285
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,720
look how horrible this is. And it's simply a desire for visible drama, something that they

286
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,840
can get on tape within the within the day of what had happened or else it isn't new. So they're

287
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,520
struck by a structural problem of the you can't get visible evidence of the important things

288
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:24,400
that happened that day. So they're stuck with trivia. So the nexus of art and science on

289
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:30,480
environmental catastrophe and risk to the future is a really fine line, isn't it? Because we have to

290
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:40,800
create mental models in people's minds about the science of what is possible, but not so dystopian

291
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,320
that they just check out there's got to be avenues for personal and cultural response.

292
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,480
I think it's it's like what you say. And I think it's I call it a tightrope walk.

293
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,120
You have to convince people to walk the tightrope with you of not falling off on either side.

294
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:06,400
If you pay if you point out the danger that we're in, which is severe and existential,

295
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,000
you know, breaking planetary boundaries, causing a runaway, hot house, earth.

296
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,840
This is a mass extinction event. This is bad as it could get. So on the other hand,

297
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,800
powers of people of society of science in theory, if we got to act together,

298
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,800
a kind of a golden age of certainly the we have the tools and capacities to solve these problems

299
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,480
and get into a good space. And so that's the other side of the of the tightrope falling

300
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,760
off is say, oh, well, that's going to be okay. What gets called cruel optimism, where you just

301
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,160
shrug and say, look, the experts will take care of this. I'm living my life. I don't need to worry

302
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,280
about this. And indeed, you don't need to worry either way. If the world is going to hell in a

303
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,840
handbasket, then there's nothing you can do about it. If the world is headed towards utopia,

304
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,240
then you don't need to do anything about it. So the tightrope walk is very, it's very narrow.

305
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,760
It really is a tightrope that you have to stay a balanced on it and say the situation is dangerous.

306
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,640
There are things we can do and must do. And that's the line you have to hold to.

307
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,760
In your book, Ministry for the Future, one of the beginning premises was that millions of people

308
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,520
in the subcontinent of India died because of higher wet bulb combination of temperature and

309
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:35,360
humidity. How much of that wet bulb India framing was science fiction? And how much of it is what

310
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:42,880
you, Kim Stanley Robinson, actually believe about the future? Well, I'm terrified that it could happen.

311
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:48,800
That is one of the main reasons I wrote Ministry for the Future was reading about the wet bulb 35

312
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,240
limit of human endurance, which I read about in about 2017. And it wasn't that it was a new fact,

313
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,240
it was that the scientific and medical communities had kind of combined. People in the climate

314
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:06,560
community had been saying temperatures could get this high and people in the medical community

315
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,680
were pointing out that would kill a person if you weren't in air conditioning, because we're not good

316
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,960
at, we need to sweat off excess heat as bodily creatures. And that works in dry heat. In wet

317
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,560
heat, it works far less well. And at wet bulb 35, which is, as you said, an index of heat and

318
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,480
humidity in combination, then you die within several hours, whether or not you are in the

319
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,440
shade or not, whether you have a fan on you or not, because sweating stops working at wet bulb

320
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,520
35 in a way that you overheat internally. And hyperthermia will kill you just as fast as hypothermia.

321
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:49,840
This was news to me. And when I read it, I thought the idea that humans could adapt to anything

322
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,200
is a false one that, and this was a thought that was out there in the culture that, oh, humans

323
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,520
are so adaptable. We'll just adapt to higher temperatures. Why are people so worried? This

324
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,000
is sort of the view of what was called for a while the eco modernists, that essentially we're

325
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,040
adaptable, we can solve any problems, quit worrying so much about the carbon burn and a global average

326
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,520
temperature rise of four degrees Celsius. Big deal. Well, that turned out to be wrong. That's

327
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,240
flatly wrong. And they don't say that anymore. And that's partly because of ministry for the future.

328
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,520
I just put it out there that the news, the real news is that will kill us. And and vast swaths

329
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,040
of the world, including the American Southeast and the Midwest, like I know where you live,

330
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,360
the one of the hottest wet bulb temperatures ever recorded was right outside Chicago

331
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,360
in the early 1990s. And it was one of those flukes that happened. But it goes to show that

332
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:55,920
anywhere because it was so humid. Yeah, it was humid heat. It was like a wet bulb 32 or even wet

333
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:05,840
bulb 34 for a couple hours. And well, a functioning electricity system will allow you to get shelter

334
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,640
in air conditioning, you can save your life. But when the grid goes down and you don't have air

335
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:15,040
conditioning, then you'd be doomed. And that's sort of why I put it in India. That's a place

336
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,760
that's going to be very susceptible to these temperatures. It's got a weaker power grid

337
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,280
that fails often. And that was that combination was what I wanted to

338
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,280
indicate could be deadly soon. And so this isn't a real fear that I think a lot of people have,

339
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,440
if they're paying attention, it's we are having heat waves, people are dying in them.

340
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:48,240
I was in a wet bulb 31 in India last April, and I was interested because of having written my book,

341
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,320
maybe interest is too weak of a word. I was highly apprehensive and it turned out it was no worse

342
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:01,600
than a than a day in in Washington DC. You know, Washington DC during a hot summer's day steamy

343
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:07,760
heat, it will it will cook you up quickly. And this day was no worse than that because it wasn't

344
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:16,080
wet bulb 35. But we could get to that soon. So you know, this is a case of starting with dystopia,

345
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,720
of starting a novel with something happening so horrible that it gets the world's attention.

346
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,160
What I'm hoping is that since we know it can happen, we'll act before we have the disaster.

347
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,320
Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that. But that would be like a whole other podcast because I think

348
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,400
there's a systems challenge that we have and climate is but one of the risks that we face.

349
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:50,640
And it's downstream of our culture optimizing for profits tethered to energy tethered to carbon.

350
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,840
And so I personally don't think we are going to we will see foresee unless something radical happens.

351
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,000
But I think to see is pretty baked in the cake and that's going to be bad enough. But we're going

352
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,840
to have many other dystopian aspects to our future than just climate. So let me ask you

353
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:18,240
a hard question maybe. What I'm really interested to see how you will respond

354
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:25,280
is science fiction, not just your writing, but science fiction writ large, inherently techno

355
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,480
optimistic, colonizing space and these things to me seem energy and ecology blind from a

356
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:41,120
biophysical perspective. So I suppose books about an Earth Trek future where humans are using 80%

357
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:47,600
less material throughput and it's a tougher material existence, but perhaps greater spiritual

358
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:54,000
pursuits. That sort of book wouldn't actually be in the sci fi genre, it would be in something else.

359
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,520
But do you have any thoughts on that? No, that would be a science fiction story and it's a good

360
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,960
one. I'm going to make a simple cut and say science fiction is any story you set in the future.

361
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:16,160
So UN demographers, stock forecasters, everybody that pitches their story into the future and says

362
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,520
this is going to happen, they don't know that. The future is unknowable. So they're doing a

363
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,560
science fiction story often it's disguised as nonfiction or as futureology or business prediction.

364
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,480
It's often a scam because anybody who claims to know what the future is bringing is making a

365
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,680
false claim. So you have to be suspicious of it. And one thing science fiction does, it says, look,

366
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,280
this is a fiction. I'm making this up, but it's interesting anyway. And so if you put a story

367
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,160
out like yours, this is a good sign. It's a form of utopian science fiction. Things could be better

368
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:57,040
for these reasons. And that's the kind of science fiction I write all the time. I would agree with

369
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,440
you the dream of space I've written about this often. And I talk about the solar system as our

370
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,320
planetary neighborhood and actually amenable to human visitation in person, which would be more

371
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,320
or less interesting, depending not that interesting, like going to Antarctica, useful, interesting,

372
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:21,920
but not transformative. The dream of going to the stars is a fantasy, a false dream that's

373
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,360
impossible. I wrote about this in Aurora. It made myself very unpopular with the people who write

374
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:32,960
space fiction. Because I said, look, it's a great story space, like Middle Earth is a great story

375
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,480
space, but it's not real. We're not going there. It's too far away. Humans co-evolved with Earth.

376
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:45,280
We are stuck with Earth. That is not a bad thing. That is just part of being part of a planet.

377
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,880
Planetary consciousness is very important. And you no more should complain about that than you would

378
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:55,840
complain that you don't live on the inside of the sun or you're not an angel or you're not an ant

379
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:01,760
or something. You're a human on planet Earth and you're a planetary creature. There's an

380
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,000
interesting side case to be made that Mars, if we were to be in a good balance with Earth biosphere

381
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,920
and a stable civilization, Mars could become an interesting scientific station, blah, blah. That's

382
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,360
a separate and side issue, a kind of a random case. You can't see the same thing about Venus,

383
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,400
for instance, or the surface of Jupiter. But Mars, you could land on it. You could live on it.

384
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,240
You could set up a little space station there. A few people could live on it.

385
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,080
A few people. Like Antarctica today, the best analogy for Mars is Antarctica,

386
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:44,960
which we're there and nobody cares. And to me, it's Stephen, a very smart and famous people.

387
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,800
Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, among them kind of say, we're screwing up Earth. Climate's

388
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,960
going to be bad. We need to colonize outer space and head to Mars. And that makes just zero sense

389
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:06,160
to me because on the worst thermonuclear runaway climate scenario, Earth is still going to be

390
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:13,520
a paradise next to Mars. I agree with you completely. That is a case that has to be made. And the

391
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,720
thing about people like Hawking's, the thing about people like Elon Musk is they're smart.

392
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,960
They aren't that smart. They aren't wise. They aren't philosophers. And they are not ecologists.

393
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,160
Very often physicists will assume that ecology is just physics in action and that they've got it

394
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,680
all sussed out because they know the rules of physics and they can do rocketry. But you can't

395
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,480
do plant biology just knowing rocketry. It's more complex. It's more interconnected. It's a

396
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,280
more complex science. And many physicists will arrogantly say that because I know the laws of

397
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,880
physics, I know everything, but they don't know how Mars works. They haven't studied biology enough

398
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,760
to understand their own ignorance. So how smart are you if you don't know how ignorant you are?

399
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,640
Homo sapiens, we have not yet lived up to our moniker. I think we've been more clever man

400
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:16,800
than wise man. Let's hope. Homo Faber, humans, the makers. That's to me the best name. We do

401
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:28,880
make things and it's a real skill. So do you think in your writing you've often advocated for

402
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:38,880
a rewilding of Earth? I assume you're aware of E. L. Wilson's notion of half Earth as one of the

403
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,600
key solutions to the future. Is this possible? Are there any signs that we could eventually do

404
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:54,000
this in coming decades? Yes, I think there is. I love E. L. Wilson and his biofilia. He's a very

405
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,520
important public intellectual and philosopher, recently deceased, but I honor his memory and he

406
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:07,680
will be remembered like Ben Franklin or William James as an important American thinker. And half

407
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,880
Earth was crucial when it came out, but I thought it was quite utopian. And now we already have 30

408
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,200
by 30. All the nations on Earth have agreed to keep 30% of their lands wild by the year 2030.

409
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:23,600
China forced that deal through, which is super interesting. And now we have the same thing

410
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:29,840
for the oceans just completed after 10 years of negotiation. These are super hopeful signs

411
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,240
that are under reported in the news because people don't get it because they are indeed

412
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:42,160
living inside their social media and their laptops. So if you spent time outdoors, you

413
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,720
would realize that if 30% of the Earth's surface was left to the wild creatures and they became

414
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:53,360
healthy by that. And I'm told by the woman who runs the 30 by 30 program in California, which is

415
00:45:53,360 --> 00:46:00,880
a formal state program, that we're at 24%. And that everybody in that pursuit talks about 30 by 30,

416
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,760
then 50 by 50, which would be the half Earth project by the year 2050. And yes, humans can indeed

417
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,200
do their agriculture and compress into the cities, which young people want to anyway, you wouldn't

418
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,320
have to force the issue. Organize our management of the landscapes in ways that don't mean pure

419
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,320
wilderness like humans never get to go here. That would be unusual in the extreme. But land use that

420
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:33,840
opens up the land to the wild animals and they get to live their lives unencumbered by us.

421
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:41,680
And then we live on the other 50% in ways that are intelligently managed in biosphere sense. So

422
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:49,280
we're helping also even on the land that we're on. Well, this is the plan. It's maybe the most

423
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,400
important part of the plan going forward, although you want to have a way to pay for it, etc.

424
00:46:55,360 --> 00:47:04,000
But I hope that can happen. Even if it were to happen, though, it really isn't 30 or 50,

425
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,240
because the 30 or 50 assumes that everything else in the biosphere is constant. And we know that the

426
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:18,480
climate and other biogeochemical feedbacks are going to accelerate. So that 30% of ecosystems,

427
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,280
what it supports today, 20, 30 years from now, climate will have an impact on it, obviously.

428
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:32,080
Yeah, it's true. And I think you're just pointing out realities here that everybody ought to know.

429
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:40,320
For that reason, there are some wildlife ecologists and conservation biologists talking

430
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,360
about making sure these corridors established for the wild creatures have room for them,

431
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:51,600
the migrate northward in the northern hemisphere, to get away from the heat. And you mentioned the

432
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,080
inevitability, almost, of us creating a two degree Celsius rise in average temperature.

433
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:04,560
That's looking very, very likely, as you know, that's why you said it. So I'm saying that means

434
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:09,120
we're going to have to suck down a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere. That's going to be a project.

435
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,440
Regenerative agriculture, reforestation, and even mechanical vacuum cleaners sucking it out of the

436
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,800
air, everything is going to have to be applied to get us back down to, I don't know, 350 parts per

437
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:29,280
million. It makes sense. I mean, there's a reason Bill McKibben chose it as the name of his organization.

438
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,240
We could do it if we don't have a runaway that blows out our abilities to do it.

439
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:42,720
Well, we could do it. Stan, I don't think you've watched much of my material because you're so

440
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:51,280
busy and we just recently met. But one of my recent framings is I call it Mordor or the Great

441
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,600
Simplification. The Great Simplification is when we can no longer kick the can financially,

442
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,800
and the amount of financial claims we've created crashed down in a snapping rubber band to our

443
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,840
biophysical reality, which means a smaller economy and smaller emissions going forward.

444
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:17,840
On the other hand, if we are able to do more carbon finance trickery and quantitative easing

445
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:24,320
number nine or whatever, we'll continue to grow the gross amount of energy that the world uses,

446
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,440
which results in GDP. But the net amount of energy that goes to hospitals and science fiction books

447
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,920
and Disneyland and shopping centers, that is going to be more and more directed towards the

448
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,280
energy and mining sector itself. They're going to need to use more to get the lower quality

449
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:52,640
resources and the mechanical vacuum cleaners and things like that, that take care of our

450
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:59,360
environmental waste. So a much larger percentage of GDP will go to energy and environmental

451
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:05,440
remediation. So in that scenario, the rest of the economy gets priced out a little bit.

452
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:12,640
If we're going to get down to 350, if that were to be a cultural objective, which I

453
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,160
am skeptical on, we would have to give up a lot of other things in order to make that the primary

454
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,400
focus. Yes?

455
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:31,920
Maybe. I take your point. It makes sense. I am interested in the people who are talking about

456
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:41,920
things like regenerative agriculture, that we could both grow our food and capture more carbon

457
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,960
in the soil that we grow our food in. So we have more biosphere health,

458
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,440
as much food, and more CO2 sucked out of the atmosphere all at once. I'm always looking to

459
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,960
these multiple goods where we need food, but we also need less CO2 in the atmosphere if we can

460
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:08,880
do both at once, which is a technique. And agriculture is a science and a technique that

461
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:16,320
people spend a whole lot of time studying. Right now, in the fields of America, especially

462
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:24,640
corn and soy, the carbon in the soil by weight is down to about 1%. And it could be that with some

463
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:31,360
changes to agricultural methods, we could begin to draw down. And it tops out pretty quickly.

464
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,960
You can't get more than 3% or 4% of carbon by weight in the soil before you have kind of

465
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:41,440
topped out that soil. It's not an infinite bank, but it's so much soil.

466
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:50,400
So just hypothetically, if we went from 1% carbon by weight in the soil to 3% globally,

467
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,240
just hypothetically, what would that do to drawing down the carbon roughly? Do you have

468
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:04,000
any idea? Well, it's incredible. And yet it's apparently true that that is enough carbon to

469
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,320
that's as much carbon as we've burned out into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution

470
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:15,680
began. Really? So yes, it's an enormous sink. Now, I mean, I'm told this by people who are

471
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,240
studying it, I am still a science fiction writer, I'm a reporter, but I'm telling you,

472
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:27,120
there are people who say this. Well, I'm actually a lot more sanguine about regenerative agriculture

473
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:37,360
than the mechanized vacuum cleaners. So if you have any world expert on regenerative agriculture,

474
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:42,960
you could introduce me to and I can take a deep dive on that publicly on a podcast. I would welcome

475
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,920
that. What are your thoughts on... I can do that. I've just run into those people. I am going to

476
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:54,960
write that down. Okay, awesome. Thank you. What are your thoughts on geoengineering? Will we eventually

477
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,440
be faced with the obvious, oh my God, look at what's happening with climate and we'll have

478
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,960
to try it? Are you morally against it? Are you hopeful of some of the science there or what do

479
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:16,000
you think? I think it might be a break glass in case of emergency type operation. I am not morally

480
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,280
against it. We've already geoengineered this earth to within an inch of its life. That's

481
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:27,760
called climate change and biosphere collapse. Civilization has been geoengineering all along.

482
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:34,000
Right to the beginning of burning down Australia when humans first arrived there, etc. So it's an

483
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,720
old practice. Now, if we needed to do it because people were dying all over the tropics because of

484
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,120
wet bulb 35 temperatures happening all the time, then this thing people talk about of casting dust

485
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:54,560
into the atmosphere and imitating a penitubo type volcanic eruption, dropping worldwide

486
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:59,040
temperatures for a degree or two for five years after which the dust falls back to the ground.

487
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:06,160
I think the real issues there are governance issues. How do we decide to do it? How do we get

488
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:12,560
public buy-in and it doesn't look like some weird Dr. Strange-Levian type experiment with the earth

489
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:19,040
itself? We've already been experimenting with the earth itself in ridiculously bad ways and a lot

490
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:25,040
of times in ignorance of what we were doing. So this would be being done on purpose in full

491
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:30,240
knowledge of what we were doing. I think we should study it. I think we should discuss the governance

492
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:39,040
of it. There are also more, what can I say, less alarming versions of geoengineering. For instance,

493
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,680
if you slow down the glaciers in Antarctica, you can call that geoengineering, but there are no

494
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,680
negative side effects that I know of. Then there are people talking about the whales that when we

495
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:56,800
killed off 95% of the whales on this planet, we wrecked the ocean's bio pump, which is also a

496
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:04,160
nice carbon drawdown mechanism, and that replacing the whales. Since you can't just replace whales,

497
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:11,520
you can replace whale poop, which is a chemical formulation, a kind of living bio excrement

498
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:18,640
of whales dropped into the ocean would create the same biospheric conditions that existed

499
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,880
before we wrecked it. So this would also be geoengineering in a peculiar way and is being

500
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,640
discussed. So the topic is huge and I don't want to go into all of the rabbit holes involved there,

501
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:35,840
but I certainly think that it's something that people should be able to talk about it

502
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,800
without a sense of shock and awe or, oh my God, there are some things man was not meant to know

503
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:46,400
type mentality. I mean, we're far past that. We are in an emergency situation and certain

504
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:52,400
emergency gestures may become necessary that we don't get a runaway into a hot house earth, which

505
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:03,280
could happen. Do you ever get the sense or just this like deja vu weird sense looking at the news

506
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:11,360
and looking around the world that we are living a science fiction novel reality that none of you

507
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:17,280
writers could have imagined 20 or 30 years ago. Every day, there's just crazy stuff happening

508
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:23,920
left right and center. And it's almost like the Twilight Zone. This is like a real Twilight

509
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:31,200
Zone meets reality TV our lives. Well, yes, I've been saying this for about 25 years. We are in a

510
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,880
science fiction novel that we are all co authoring together. And what I mean is the future is crashing

511
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:42,000
us that that there's the great acceleration has accelerated yet again, and everything's happening

512
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,960
faster than we can come to grips with. And that's what a science fiction novel is trying to capture

513
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:53,120
is that feeling. So for sure. But what you would want, although Twilight Zone was a great show,

514
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,520
you would want something more like I don't know Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispissed, which which

515
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:05,200
actually is very troubled and filled with revolutions and conflict. So it's not like you're

516
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,840
going to dodge revolutions and conflict here because we're in the midst of it. It's a very

517
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:15,120
melodramatic science fiction novel that we're caught in the middle of and we just have to try

518
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:23,440
to write it towards utopia. I actually posted on Twitter a month ago that I my entire life is

519
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:32,000
filled with nonfiction and I needed some fiction recommendations and I had 1000 replies. And Ursula

520
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,880
K. Le Guin's Dispissed was like among the most popular ones. So I just bought it. I have it

521
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,640
outside. I've not read it. That's good. So are all those books behind you? Are those all science

522
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:51,840
fiction books? No, that's a non this is a nonfiction shelf. I keep John Muir. This is accidental,

523
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,720
but I have a full shelf of John Muir and then a full shelf of California nonfiction and the top

524
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:04,320
shelf is Antarctica. I see a really long shelf of Antarctica. That might be the 90% of Antarctica

525
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,520
in literature right there. So just out of curiosity, how many hours a week do you spend reading?

526
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:19,360
Oh, well, a lot. I read nonfiction by day and I I treat it instrumentally. I almost strip

527
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:26,160
mind my nonfiction to get what I need for my fiction. So I read nonfiction all day and but

528
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:34,880
I'm writing also, I reckon it must add up to a couple three hours of reading per day of nonfiction.

529
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:39,920
And then every night when I go to bed, I read fiction for about a half hour or an hour.

530
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,800
Depends on how long I can stay awake. But I'm always reading a novel and when I finish one,

531
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:52,960
I start another one. And I love it. I love reading fiction. Reading nonfiction, I don't love,

532
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,800
but it's important. It's part of my work. It's good literary hygiene that you've described two

533
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:05,200
hours of nonfiction half hour of fiction before bed. Yeah, yeah. And I let and I must say,

534
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,400
read a novel when you go to bed and you'll be absorbed you'll fall asleep in a different world.

535
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:15,760
You'll live that life. It will be the best part of your day or let's put it this way,

536
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,600
you'll look forward to it every day. Oh, good. Now I get to dive into like right now I'm reading

537
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:28,000
the ragged, trousered philanthropists, a British working class novel from about 1904,

538
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,160
very funky, very serious, very sad, very intense working class life when you were in

539
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:39,200
the precarity, precarity really means it when you're going to die if you lose your job

540
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:45,280
and your family too. And then I'm also reading Freddie the Pig and the baseball team from Mars,

541
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,000
a children's book that I read when I was a child. Obviously, it had a big impact on me since I still

542
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,280
play softball and I still write about Mars. And then sort of lighten the load. I usually just read

543
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,240
one novel at a time to tell you the truth. I think that's the best way you join that world.

544
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,440
But in this case, I'm kind of lightening the load of the ragged trouser philanthropists.

545
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:16,480
Well, lightening the load is is part of the, you know, the recipe to remain sane in these times,

546
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:24,160
because you and I in the stories we're trying to share with society, this stuff can get toxic

547
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:29,760
reading and learning. Like you said, a few years ago, you learned about wet bulb 35. I just learned

548
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:38,320
about that two years ago. And you just add these things. And the human physiology and our genome

549
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:44,800
didn't evolve to handle this much toxic information about our world. So we need antidotes. I have

550
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,640
dogs and I live in a forest, but I also like fiction reading as well.

551
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:56,000
Well, I think that what I read about you before we got on this podcast, that this that you figured

552
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:01,280
it out, that you're living on the land, you're paying attention to a particular piece of land,

553
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:06,960
and you've got other animals, companion species, that you're taking care of and helping and they're

554
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:13,200
helping and teaching you things to you as an animal, that this is what everybody, if everybody

555
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:18,960
had it figured out to that extent. And even you can you can you can live a life in an apartment

556
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,920
in Manhattan that includes these things if you've got it figured out in the first place. So it's

557
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:31,760
really a matter of understanding what we are and then adapting living your life to accommodate what

558
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:36,640
we really are, which is animals and social primates and all the things that we obviously are.

559
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:44,240
The more you embrace that and live it rather than sitting on your butt looking at screens all day

560
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,920
every day, that will drive you mad. And so we live in a culture that's slightly mad.

561
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:58,480
I agree. Thank you for that. I'm not sure I have it all figured out and I do still need to read

562
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:08,240
the equivalent of Freddie the pig at night. So key question here, climate and to a lesser extent

563
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:15,600
biodiversity and PFAS and endocrine disruptors and all these other things are becoming more aware

564
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:23,440
and teenage humans are coming into learning about the world and learning all this stuff.

565
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:30,800
And I've taught a college course for eight of the last 10 years. In my experience, there's a lot

566
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:37,040
of scary material at the, you know, I don't know how many tens of thousands of climate courses there

567
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:43,200
are in high school and college, but worldwide. And there's scary material. This is what's

568
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,800
happening in the climate. These are the scenarios. This is what's going to happen in the 21st century.

569
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:51,840
But there's kind of too narrow a solution set just at the end of the semester as well. We

570
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:58,800
switch to renewables, you drive an EV or we end capitalism. But do you think that we're approaching

571
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:06,080
a time when there could be more systemic story and recommendations to young people that involves

572
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:13,280
behavior change from within like being happy with social natural human capital rather than

573
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:20,320
financial status? You know, what are your thoughts on this? Are we are we approaching young people

574
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,520
with the right message on on all these systemic crises?

575
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:33,120
I don't know. It's a good question. It speaks to what Raymond Williams called a structure of feeling

576
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:39,840
that a civilization has a structure of feeling that is cultural. It's not biological. And it

577
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:46,960
and it changes over time at different historical moments. I think actually of the the list that

578
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:52,000
you made ending capitalism, if young people are being talked to about that, that would be crucial.

579
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:56,080
I don't think they are. They live in capitalist realism where they're going to be told

580
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,840
typically nothing can ever change. This is the system you have to plug into it. The system is

581
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:07,200
unchangeable. And that's not true. The system is changeable and has to change because biosphere

582
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:13,360
reality is forcing change. So may they might be aware that change is coming fast and it isn't

583
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:18,400
planned and it's going to be incomprehensible. I see a lot of climate dread, a lot of anxiety

584
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,960
the young people, a sense that well, we're doomed but ready. And no matter what we do,

585
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:29,840
we're just on a downhill slide into chaos and disorder, which is not an inaccurate assessment

586
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:37,360
of the way things feel for sure. And you can't change the feeling just by pushing a button or

587
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:42,320
saying some magic words. You actually have to change the political economy that you're in

588
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:47,680
to one that's more life positive. So ending capitalism would be one big,

589
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:52,880
I mean, geez, when you say it, it's just so radical. I would say now reforming capitalism

590
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,800
extremely rapidly to getting to something that is more like cooperatives. It is post capitalism

591
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:04,400
in its first step. That would be a big step and we aren't really there but we're trembling on the

592
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:11,120
brink. I think also there was a world order working in the neoliberal times, say the 1990s,

593
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:15,360
that isn't working anymore because it doesn't take into account the biosphere or what we really

594
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:20,880
are as creatures. And yet there's now 8 billion of us. So the old system isn't working. The new

595
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:26,480
system hasn't yet been invented. This is often talked about the in between the interagnum between

596
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:33,120
one system and the other. It feels frightening because you can't, despite me being a science

597
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:38,240
fiction writer, what I can say from that is you can't see the future. You can't predict the future.

598
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:44,800
There's too many factors and it's changing too fast. So I mean there's reason for everybody to

599
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:51,360
feel anxiety and climate dread but what you can do and say to the young people is solutions are

600
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:57,040
out there. Let's make the solutions happen. Let's work together on the solutions. You'll be one

601
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,400
little brick and a giant wall but the wall is possible. We can build that wall and you put

602
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:08,000
your brick into place and you'll be part of that historical wave, that movement that changed

603
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:14,560
this generation is tasked with a really heavy task to dodge a mass extinction event

604
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:21,440
that previous generations started mostly by accident. Well, tough assignment and people

605
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:27,440
will be freaking out the entire time and even fighting against you the entire time. So it couldn't

606
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:34,880
be weirder, harder and all you can do is try to call out for solidarity, put your shoulder to the

607
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:41,120
wheel and fight the good fight anyway. So do you ever speak to younger audiences in addition

608
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:47,280
to your activist message that you just described? What sort of advice do you give to teenage humans

609
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:55,760
who are old enough to intellectually understand this stuff but not yet sucked into the consumptive

610
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:04,080
vortex of modern society? Do you have personal advice to young teenage or early 20 humans?

611
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:11,680
Yes, I talk to all the schools in Davis on a regular basis because I have teacher friends who

612
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:17,040
asked me to come by and in Davis it's easy and then I talk to college students all over the world

613
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:22,960
in literally the case and they're young enough that they're forming their ideologies, they're

614
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:27,120
figuring out their ways in life, they're thinking about what they're going to do with their lives

615
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:35,280
and they're very active and open-minded. That's the crowd to talk to I think and it's a privilege

616
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:40,880
to talk to them, I try to learn from them and listen to them as much as I can and what I just say

617
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,520
to them is no matter what you're interested in and you can follow your interests, follow your

618
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:51,040
nose, I'm interested in art, I'm interested in engineering, I'm interested in plant biology and

619
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:57,280
why bugs eat plants and why plants are protected from bugs, whatever you're interested in,

620
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:04,320
it's a climate change project now. You can be anything, a sculptor or an accountant,

621
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:11,520
someone measuring things and engineering for sure, well it's going to be climate change work,

622
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,280
there will be work for you that's good work and here's how I try to encourage them.

623
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:23,280
When I was in younger middle age there was a joke, the one who dies with the most toys wins,

624
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:34,160
it was a bumper sticker and it was making fun of and expressing the meaningless cynicism of

625
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:41,360
middle-class American society circa 1990, it was an 80s thing, a 90s thing, people were worried,

626
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,360
the capitalist wheel of birth and death, you work all your life then you die, nothing matters,

627
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:52,880
I mean what's the point here, so this is what the bumper sticker was making a joke about,

628
01:08:53,440 --> 01:09:00,400
whoever dies with the most toys wins, obviously stupid, absurd, a lack of meaning and this was

629
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:05,760
the problem. Well now I can say to young people, your life has meaning, we are in a crisis,

630
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:13,840
everything you do can actually fight for the people of the future, it's a cause and so life

631
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:19,760
has meaning, it may be a rather scary and desperate meaning but it's better than no meaning at all,

632
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:25,600
which was the previous problem that's completely gone away, so sometimes I try to cheer them up,

633
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,960
you know you're lucky to have climate change because otherwise you'd be in an existential

634
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:34,000
despair because capitalist reality is totally stupid and you've got to get past that.

635
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:40,720
Yeah two comments there, first I remember seeing that bumper sticker, I didn't know it was a joke,

636
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:47,440
I thought people actually believed that, I didn't know and secondly yeah, I've heard this from a

637
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:54,880
lot of my students and colleagues, we have a lack of meaning in our culture right now,

638
01:09:56,080 --> 01:10:03,200
you know kind of the theology of past religions and then the theology of economic growth

639
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:10,240
are waning and what is it all for, what is our purpose and what other purpose can there be

640
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:18,000
in my opinion than the viability of the ecosystems on our planet for the long term,

641
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,120
to me it all comes back to that and climate's a piece of that but it's not the only piece.

642
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:29,200
It's not the only piece, yeah, so you're living in Wisconsin and it's a Wisconsin guy,

643
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:36,000
Aldo Leopold, what's good is what's good for the land, well this is a very powerful statement,

644
01:10:36,720 --> 01:10:42,960
very powerful, it's a philosophy, it's a religion and when he said the land I think he means all

645
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:50,080
the living things that make up the land of course, it's easily understood and it's incredibly

646
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:57,680
powerful as an ethos but also as a decider, you can say well what's good, I mean you've got your

647
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:02,320
opinion, I've got my opinion, you can't determine it but what's good is what's good for the land

648
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,440
because that's what'll be passed on to the other animals and to the generations to come so

649
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:16,080
the Leopoldian land ethic as it's called in ethics and philosophy classes and ecology classes,

650
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:24,640
this is a very, very high statement of how you can, in a single phrase, you can make up a new

651
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:34,480
religion that makes sense. I love that, you know in my job now I'm non-ideological because I'm

652
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:42,400
trying to unite many different groups of humans towards a common, you know, path that's going to

653
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:51,920
face all of us so I'm apolitical but if I do have an ideology it's what you just said,

654
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,800
it's that I deeply care about the ecosystems and other species and irrespective of everything else

655
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:04,240
that I write and speak about, at the end of the day that is something that I have no shame to tell

656
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:10,560
at the rooftops to any political group or age group or that's what really matters

657
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:18,800
during our times right now. I'll just throw that back at you unintendedly, what do you care most

658
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:26,080
about in the world? I mean you're a very accomplished author and activist but like at the end of the

659
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:31,920
day what I think I could probably guess but I'll ask you anyways because I ask all my guests what

660
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:38,160
do you care most about in the world Stan? Well I'm just like everybody else, the answers are

661
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:46,080
immediate and instinctive, I care about my family, my friends, my community, I care about animals in

662
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:51,920
a way that I didn't when I was younger. I just recently went to India for the first time and what

663
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:57,520
I noted immediately was they live their lives with animals still as part of daily town life

664
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:04,800
in a way that's incredibly beautiful and inspiring but maybe I'll turn it back and I just want to say

665
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:14,880
that um an ideology is the imaginary relationship to the real situation and therefore everybody has

666
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:22,240
one and has to have one. If you don't have one that would be a mental disability quite severe

667
01:13:22,240 --> 01:13:27,680
so we all have that imaginative relationship to the real conditions of existence which is what an

668
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:33,600
ideology is so you have one too and that translates to a politics which you have one too. It can be

669
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:40,080
ecumenical, it can be directed to a particular kind of point that tries to transcend stupid

670
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:48,400
partisan divides in the current mediated American landscape or older visions of left

671
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:54,800
and right etc etc etc. Sure those are deserved to be transcended in some kind of biophilia,

672
01:13:55,600 --> 01:14:01,520
some kind of land ethic, we'll do this for the good of our land in the local area, all the

673
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,320
creatures on it including the humans and that will be you know that's a little vague, it's more like

674
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:13,440
a religion than a politics but it can go to a politics. Yeah there we go, we are looking at

675
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:22,240
biophilia by Edward O. Wilson, Edward Wilson, beautiful concept. Yeah I have almost all his books

676
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:28,800
and I agree with what you said earlier. Um what uh well actually I wonder if I have uh

677
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:37,440
uh well he oh yeah here I have this book um The Superorganism by Yeo Wilson uh I wrote an

678
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:45,280
academic paper about the superorganism um which I'll send to you so um in all of your travels

679
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:52,800
and your lectures to young people and and your work what things have you noticed or experienced

680
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:58,800
in the last couple years since ministry came out that really give you hope and motivation

681
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:05,520
about coming decades despite all the craziness in the Twilight Zone-esque uh sci-fi world we're living

682
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:15,520
in? Well it's a little um technical but it's true I've been encouraged by the 30 by 30 movements and

683
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:22,560
the COP 15 the biosphere um treaty in Montreal that the Chinese hosted with the Canadians

684
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:30,480
last year astonishing the ocean treaty just signed astonishing these are big victories

685
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:34,720
and even though they're just promises that nation states make to each other in other words they can

686
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:43,280
be broken by other people later on those promises matter because it's a putting forth of uh statements

687
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:48,960
of intent and that these things are important I learned that there's a network for greening

688
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:57,360
the financial system that is uh owned and operated by and and joined by about 90 of the biggest

689
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:04,000
central banks on earth including the super big ones out of the G7 and the G20 although central

690
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:09,760
banks are trying to green the financial system such that there is- That sounds like an oxymoron to me.

691
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:16,640
Well but but that that's uh that would be bad if it was an oxymoron you want to correct that um the

692
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:23,920
money needs to be spent which is to say human labor needs to be expended and you have to be

693
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:29,520
able to make your living doing good biosphere work rather than bad biosphere. Oh so this gets

694
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:34,880
back to the ecology coin we talked about earlier something like that. Yeah yeah and and uh you

695
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,440
can look it up the network for greening the financial system has a website it has a white

696
01:16:39,440 --> 01:16:44,960
paper with nine suggestions they they're pretty technical like two of them I don't even understand

697
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:52,320
but what they're really saying is that money itself is a political act the and the fact that

698
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:57,120
everybody believes in money and you can go down and stick a piece of plastic into a slot and then

699
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:03,600
someone will give you a cup of coffee so that's that kind of belief is very deep and cooperative

700
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:11,360
belief in money if money itself was greened at the roots and is being made up at its very start

701
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:19,120
by central banks and this is fiat money in other words the US dollar being spent on green projects

702
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:25,920
first and then circulating in the general economy of that itself might drive a lot of

703
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:33,920
restoration actions and might allow us to dodge the mass extinction of it. I will I will look into

704
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:40,240
that I think I at least partially agree with that but with a big old asterisk stand which is

705
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:48,400
as long as we have GDP as our global cultural goal we will burn more energy and consume more

706
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:53,920
stuff and if we get more efficient we're just going to burn more so if we have a an overlay in

707
01:17:54,000 --> 01:18:00,000
there of green of where the money goes into something green first I have to think about

708
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:06,240
how that would work. No and no I take your point and both of the things you said are right GDP is

709
01:18:06,240 --> 01:18:15,200
wrong it is a rubric an index and a way of measuring human civilization that is flatly wrong

710
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:23,120
and destructive and so growth of which is usually a shorthand for growth of GDP that's a growth of

711
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:30,960
destruction and is like a cancer so human development index gross national happiness this is a

712
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:38,880
Bhutanese thing other indexes that rate the human economic efforts by a different set of standards

713
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:46,320
these are crucial that's a crucial part of the work. So if you could wave a magic wand and there

714
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:52,320
was no personal recourse to your actions what is one thing that you would do to improve human

715
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:58,960
and planetary futures and as a science fiction author I imagine you have dozens of such ideas.

716
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:09,520
I don't know I I mean it all it sounds so instrumentalist or technical and maybe I

717
01:19:09,520 --> 01:19:14,240
should put it at the level of the structure of feeling like you've been talking about a different

718
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:23,600
attitude towards life. I mean some of it is absolutely simplistic if people would spend

719
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:31,840
more time outdoors it would reorient their sense of reality in fundamental ways that changes the

720
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:38,160
view of everything. We spend too much time indoors we live in boxes looking at boxes this is silly

721
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:44,080
stuff and it's distorting our sense of what's real and what's important so I mean that's a

722
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:51,040
little simple you could also go technical like I have been in most of this talk if fiat money was

723
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:58,160
created with a good green spending of it first off the bat then many other things would be better

724
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:05,200
30 by 30 if I could if I could instantly say that 50 percent of the earth and the ocean were left

725
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:11,600
to the other animals and that we concentrated our activities on 50 percent of the earth and 50

726
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:17,840
percent of the oceans if I could wave that magic wand and here's the thing people are already waving

727
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:24,880
it the 30 by 30 thing is profound when I first read the Yale Wilson book half earth I thought

728
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:31,920
beautiful idea will never happen and here 20 years later it's happening well I'm stunned and

729
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,880
now here it's worth following for a second why is that happening I think everybody

730
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:43,600
at the level of decision making and policy and also all well-meaning citizens who understand

731
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,760
that their lives depend on science and what they're scared for their lives they run to a scientist

732
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,400
which is to say their doctor they looked at the evidence they've taken it in they've realized

733
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:58,720
we're in a biosphere emergency and that civilization will crash if the biosphere crashes and we've only

734
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:04,240
got 10 or 15 years to cope with it but it's better than having only one week to cope with it

735
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:09,440
which we couldn't do and it's better than having 500 years to cope with it because we wouldn't pay

736
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:15,280
attention so we're in an emergency and people are acting like it but it's an actionable

737
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,000
emergency space in other words we've got this 10 or 15 years and I think the good things are

738
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,680
happening because there are so many people who actually know this now and they are doing something

739
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:35,440
about it. So last just personal question how many hours a day you live in California so

740
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,840
that's different than Wisconsin but how many hours a day do you actually spend outside

741
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:46,480
and how is that different from 10 or 15 years ago? Well because I moved my writing life outdoors

742
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:52,560
and my recreational life which is you know an hour of throwing frisbee golf at a running pace

743
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:57,120
with my friend and going for a walk with my wife I'm calculating here as I talk

744
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:04,000
and you can well you can't see it in this morning light my poor skin is taking a hit from all this

745
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:10,800
outdoorsness I should use sunscreen it's probably I'm outdoors about eight hours a day. Awesome

746
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:17,920
and is that an increase from 15 20 years ago? Yeah but that's a simple structural change I

747
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:24,720
started writing outdoors rather than indoors and so that's five hours a day. Yeah awesome

748
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:34,160
Stan this has been great thank you so much for your mental neuronal connections that end up creating

749
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:40,560
new mental imagery and connections in other humans it's an art and a skill and a gift

750
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:47,520
and I hope I hope you have a great next novel in mind and we'll have another conversation.

751
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:53,280
Well thank you Nate it's been a pleasure and I might not have another novel for a long time

752
01:22:53,280 --> 01:23:01,120
but it's okay I am I'm doing other things I've had an awfully long writing career and so if I get

753
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:05,840
a few years off to kind of reorganize my poor brain that's probably a good thing too so

754
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:08,960
I'll be having fun yeah thanks Stan
