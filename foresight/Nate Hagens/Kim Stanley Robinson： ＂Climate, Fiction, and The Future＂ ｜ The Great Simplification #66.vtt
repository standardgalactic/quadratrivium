WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.880
Joining me today is Kim Stanley Robinson, a very well-known science fiction author.

00:06.880 --> 00:13.280
I've long thought that we need to better communicate science to the general public,

00:13.280 --> 00:18.480
but in a way that uses art and literature to be able to change the mental landscapes

00:18.480 --> 00:25.680
of an individual human mind. Stan has been publishing science fiction novels for almost

00:25.680 --> 00:33.040
40 years now. He's a leading figure in climate fiction writing. Stan incorporates strong influences

00:33.040 --> 00:39.840
of ecological, cultural, and political themes and features scientists as the heroes in his work.

00:40.960 --> 00:46.720
Many of you have heard or read his most recent novel, Ministry for the Future,

00:46.720 --> 00:52.480
which has been highly praised for the illumination of possible near-term climate impacts

00:52.480 --> 01:01.280
and how imagining such an issue might change our responses to what we face. How can we incorporate

01:01.280 --> 01:07.840
fiction into our set of tools to bring more people into awareness of the pressing system dynamics that

01:07.840 --> 01:16.320
underpin global human events? This was a very interesting conversation. I hope you enjoyed it.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.880
Please welcome Kim Stanley Robinson.

01:30.480 --> 01:33.920
Hello, Stan. Hey there, Nate. Great to see you.

01:35.040 --> 01:41.760
Yes, good to see you too. So you, let's dive right into it. I've long known of your name,

01:41.760 --> 01:47.840
because I've read some of your books long ago, but you've kind of been thrust into a broader

01:47.840 --> 01:55.200
spotlight because of our cultural awareness of climate change and your recent very popular book

01:55.200 --> 02:02.160
Ministry for the Future, which kind of took a view in the future of accelerating climate damage

02:02.800 --> 02:09.680
to society. You've long been an environmentalist. How did you decide that fiction writing was the

02:09.680 --> 02:13.520
way that you wanted to get involved and contribute to these issues?

02:15.440 --> 02:23.520
Well, for me, the fiction writing came first. So the environmentalism came later. I was a

02:23.520 --> 02:29.360
reader as a kid. I grew up in a suburbia in Southern California. I was a beach kid. I did love the

02:29.360 --> 02:36.160
beach with all my heart, but I didn't think of it as anything but getting out of suburbia into

02:36.160 --> 02:44.800
something more fun. And then I was an English major. I loved all literature, but the novel sort

02:44.800 --> 02:51.040
of takes precedence in my reading life and in the world at large these days when it comes to

02:51.040 --> 02:57.760
literature, maybe not compared to screenplays. Anyway, I got into science fiction because it

02:57.760 --> 03:04.400
seemed like the best way of conveying the way my reality felt, which was Southern California

03:04.400 --> 03:10.400
turning from orange grows into city extremely rapidly. And so science fiction struck a chord

03:10.400 --> 03:19.200
with me and I wrote it. That's my start. And then I started going to this year in Nevada when I was

03:19.200 --> 03:28.320
an undergraduate in college and that mountain consciousness was pretty all-encompassing. It

03:28.320 --> 03:35.600
reoriented my lowland life to be always thinking about the mountains, my love of the mountains.

03:35.600 --> 03:41.920
What did that mean? What were the threats involved? And I began to notice that California in general

03:41.920 --> 03:50.720
is what you could seriously call a terraformed space. The waters distributed by unnatural means.

03:50.720 --> 03:59.200
It's an irrigated landscape. It's now urban, but also ag. It made me pay attention. And then

04:00.240 --> 04:07.360
by that time the environmental movement was really an active thing in the world,

04:07.360 --> 04:14.400
pointing out the dangers that even preceded our awareness of climate change. And then climate

04:14.400 --> 04:21.280
change was just the, how can you say it, the exponential growth of an environmental consciousness.

04:21.280 --> 04:27.920
And it began to invade my science fiction. Anytime I set a story in the next 100 years or two or

04:27.920 --> 04:35.760
almost anywhere, the climate and the environment were prominent players in the story. So that's how

04:35.760 --> 04:43.520
it came about for me. And what's been your experience? Have you found your works, your books to be

04:43.520 --> 04:50.880
effective in educating or swaying people? No, not until the ministry for the future.

04:52.000 --> 04:58.240
I can say that my books were considered, oh, well, you know, that's Stan, he's our Boy Scout,

04:58.240 --> 05:06.400
he's our nature guy. Science fiction community likes to be ecumenical and welcoming to

05:07.200 --> 05:12.000
all kinds of viewpoints. And in the great world of the science fiction community,

05:12.000 --> 05:19.120
it's a melting pot where no matter what your politics or your interests, you can be taken in

05:19.120 --> 05:25.040
with open arms. So that was the attitude towards me. And in the larger world, I had my readers.

05:25.040 --> 05:34.000
But and truthfully, I mean, to be more serious about it, as time passed, it became obvious that I was

05:34.960 --> 05:40.720
a leading proponent of climate fiction, which was near future science fiction,

05:41.360 --> 05:46.960
paying attention to the over determining reality of climate change. So in other words,

05:46.960 --> 05:53.520
all nearest future science fiction had to turn into climate fiction to be at all realistic or

05:53.520 --> 06:01.120
relevant. And so it wasn't just the ministry for the future itself, like from zero to 60. But

06:01.120 --> 06:11.200
in a growing sense of where I was in the cultural conversation, and New York 2140 was a big step

06:11.200 --> 06:17.520
in that way with its sea level rise and its climate finance, ministry still nevertheless has

06:20.640 --> 06:25.760
joined the or how can I say it, it's it's blown up my life, but it's joined the world

06:25.760 --> 06:31.200
conversation in a way that none of my books ever have before. So I wonder if you had written that

06:31.200 --> 06:36.480
exact same book 20 years ago, if it would have been far, you know, equally well written, if it

06:36.480 --> 06:42.640
would have been far less well received, just because the public awareness of climate still

06:42.640 --> 06:49.680
wasn't the way it is now where we have events and things that people recognize are out of the normal.

06:50.640 --> 06:56.480
I think that can be a that's almost certainly true. Yes. And we have a small thought experiment

06:56.480 --> 07:05.760
that shows how true it is. I published 40 signs of rain in I think 2004. And I want to say that 40

07:05.760 --> 07:11.520
signs of rain is not as good at novel as ministry for the future. It's it's confined to Washington,

07:11.520 --> 07:18.000
DC to the National Science Foundation. It's an attempt to go local. But because the local was

07:18.000 --> 07:23.520
Washington, DC, that was its supposed international aspect, you know, capital of the world and all

07:23.520 --> 07:28.560
that. But National Science Foundation is not a powerful agency. It was a bit of a joke on my

07:28.560 --> 07:37.920
part. I I struggled to convey Washington, DC, and the federal bureaucracy in a novel. And

07:37.920 --> 07:44.480
my struggles were, I think, evident on the page. But it was also 2004. And this was just an odd

07:44.480 --> 07:50.640
thing to be interested in then. And I must say Al Gore's in In Can Me In Truth came out almost

07:50.640 --> 07:57.360
the same week as my novel. And it did have an impact. So that was partly Al Gore, partly movie,

07:57.360 --> 08:03.280
partly a better demonstration of the severity of the problem than my novel. Nevertheless,

08:03.280 --> 08:07.440
if I had if the if the book I had put out then had been ministry, it wouldn't have gotten the

08:07.440 --> 08:10.320
same attention that it got in 2020.

08:11.760 --> 08:17.680
Just a brief personal question. Did you win like writing awards in your high school English

08:17.680 --> 08:22.560
classes? And were you always like going home and writing short stories and stuff? Or is this

08:22.560 --> 08:25.760
something that evolved into a passion and skill over time?

08:27.520 --> 08:34.320
In high school, I loved Shakespeare and poetry and detective novels. And there weren't any prizes

08:34.320 --> 08:42.000
to be had, except for one, my English teacher, Mrs Catherine Lee, a sweetheart, a complete anglophile,

08:42.000 --> 08:49.200
an elderly woman who seemed of a previous age to us, because I'm talking the late 60s here.

08:49.200 --> 08:57.200
And she was probably had her, her looks and her mind formed in the 1930s. So she's probably

08:57.200 --> 09:02.320
was quite a bit younger than I am now, but we considered her to be ancient. But she was lovely.

09:02.320 --> 09:08.320
She paid attention. She liked it that I like literature. We were like the two literature

09:08.880 --> 09:14.400
lovers in the entirety of Orange County, as far as we could tell. And so she was fond of me.

09:14.400 --> 09:21.440
It's amazing how high school memories like that are imprinted on our amygdala.

09:22.080 --> 09:27.120
My high school English teacher Rita Mack, I specifically can see the pen writing blah,

09:27.680 --> 09:38.560
boring in red ink on some of my papers. So more broadly, with writing and fiction, etc.,

09:38.560 --> 09:45.920
how important do you think art is, broadly speaking, versus science in our current kind

09:45.920 --> 09:52.320
of poly crisis situation? It's a good question and a hard one. And I'm not

09:52.640 --> 10:00.160
good at answering it because I'm kind of inside my own bubble looking out into the world from a

10:00.160 --> 10:06.880
particular perspective. I'd say it's the sciences that are making all the stuff that keep us alive

10:06.880 --> 10:12.720
and telling us how the world works. And this is the science dominated world or science created

10:12.720 --> 10:21.280
world. But then the science at its straightest, where it's really being honest with itself and

10:21.280 --> 10:29.200
with everything else, and notice I'm personifying it, is modest in this way. It says we're learning

10:29.200 --> 10:34.080
about the world. We're creating some power over the world. We're not going to tell you what to do

10:34.080 --> 10:40.720
with it. That's the job of everybody else. And so they give over, many scientists will just say,

10:40.720 --> 10:46.320
look, this is society's job or this is the work for philosophy. And so there the arts and humanities

10:46.320 --> 10:52.640
come in. What do we do with our new powers? How do we get along with each other? These are not

10:52.640 --> 11:02.400
scientific questions. These are humanities questions. And so the arts can come in to tell the story

11:02.400 --> 11:11.440
and to create a sense of meaning. And so that is important. It's vaguer and it's also like a

11:12.000 --> 11:16.960
giant echo chamber that we're all inside where everybody's yammering all at once. So in other

11:16.960 --> 11:27.200
words, it's quite incoherent. But it is important. Well, I would argue that art is more important,

11:27.200 --> 11:32.960
but it has to be informed by the correct system science. And a lot of our, like you said,

11:33.600 --> 11:39.440
everyone's kind of yammering in the same chamber. A core message in ministry of the future is that

11:39.440 --> 11:46.320
civilization has to trust in science. But I wonder what version of science, because economic,

11:47.120 --> 11:54.320
which in my opinion is not a science, is overlaid on top of climate science and gives in my opinion

11:54.320 --> 12:00.480
quite inappropriate roadmaps of the future. In effect, there are no integrated assessment models

12:00.480 --> 12:06.640
that show a decline in growth from today to the year 2100. What do you think of that?

12:07.600 --> 12:16.000
Well, I'm with you on that. I think economics is a quantified ethics or a power politics disguised

12:16.000 --> 12:22.160
as a science. So it's an instrument of power to run some numbers and say, we'll do this because of

12:22.160 --> 12:28.640
these reasons, because it makes economic sense. I would divide it, it is a social science and it

12:28.640 --> 12:36.160
uses scientific tools. It could be more useful than it is. If you think of it as being something like

12:36.240 --> 12:43.520
geometry where there are theorems, but the theorems are decided based on axioms, then economics needs

12:43.520 --> 12:50.640
to go back to the axioms. What are we doing it for? If it's for human welfare and also the welfare

12:50.640 --> 12:58.480
of the rest of the biosphere over the long haul, then those axioms would drive the economic

12:58.480 --> 13:04.960
calculations and we would get different rubrics than profit or shareholder value, which are

13:04.960 --> 13:11.840
ridiculous rubrics, gross domestic product, ridiculous. And even this word you use growth,

13:11.840 --> 13:19.920
when it's used in economics, its meanings are peculiar and various and unhelpful. We need

13:19.920 --> 13:26.240
the poorest people on the planet to live at adequacy, so that's some kind of growth. We don't

13:26.240 --> 13:32.000
need the richest people on the planet to get richer, which I have consistently since the 1980s,

13:32.000 --> 13:39.680
but especially during the pandemic, where something like 70% of the quantitative easing value

13:39.680 --> 13:45.760
created in the pandemic to keep the economy going was captured by the top 2% of wealthy people.

13:45.760 --> 13:51.840
Well, not only that, I often ask what is the carbon footprint of quantitative easing,

13:51.840 --> 13:57.520
something that people don't ask that question. True. Well, this is an economics question that

13:57.520 --> 14:03.920
gets delinked from physical systems questions like you ask, and so economics is ridiculous in

14:03.920 --> 14:10.640
that sense also. It's not rating biosphere impacts, those were used to be negative externalities,

14:10.640 --> 14:15.520
they weren't even included at all. Now they're attempting to include them, but things like the

14:15.520 --> 14:23.680
discount rate or the various wiggles that currently enacted, which is to say legal and powerful

14:23.760 --> 14:32.800
economic systems, they are still very poorly aligned to people and planet. So it is something

14:32.800 --> 14:37.920
that I talk about, and the fact the discussion of it in Ministry for the Future is one of the

14:37.920 --> 14:44.720
reasons that the book has struck people's imagination, that economics could be changed,

14:44.720 --> 14:48.400
that it could be aimed better, that it could be recalibrated, and that it could be

14:48.960 --> 14:56.160
something like the carbon coin, which I would say is a kind of a symbol for power and money being

14:56.880 --> 15:02.640
redirected to the public good and to biosphere health. Well, people were encouraged by that,

15:02.640 --> 15:06.720
they were interested, they were thinking, oh, you know, it's possible to change.

15:07.440 --> 15:15.680
That was one of my few criticisms or not criticisms, but points of interest in ministry

15:16.400 --> 15:22.400
that you wrote about a pro-social, pro-environmental behavior that sequesters carbon would be rewarded

15:22.960 --> 15:29.280
with a carbon coin. But I wondered, in such a society, if you do things and you're rewarded

15:29.280 --> 15:36.000
with a carbon coin, then don't you in turn just go and spend it on other things that create or

15:36.080 --> 15:46.240
contain indirect carbon? Yes, I think that's valid, and it is a problem. I guess I've been

15:46.240 --> 15:52.640
thinking about this since you've communicated with me before this and pondering it, and I guess

15:52.640 --> 16:02.960
I would say the book is a little cautious in that it tries to propose methods we could use

16:02.960 --> 16:09.280
right now that are not completely shocking, that they're legal. You could imagine them getting

16:09.280 --> 16:17.040
passed by central banks and legislatures, and so it's Keynesian. Keynesianism is not radical,

16:17.040 --> 16:24.000
nor is it particularly biosphere friendly. It is a standard economic system where the government

16:24.000 --> 16:31.440
actually stimulates the economy in times of distress, like a depression, and that stimulus is

16:31.440 --> 16:38.560
indeed what you're talking about. More carbon ultimately will be burned. If carbon burning

16:38.560 --> 16:45.840
is fundamental to the system working, then by keeping it healthy, you're burning more carbon.

16:45.840 --> 16:56.400
Yes, but the carbon coin, if it's an adjusted right, then you bring down a ton of CO2 from the

16:56.400 --> 17:05.200
atmosphere. Hopefully the creation of the, what can I say, the needs and the wants, the necessities

17:05.200 --> 17:12.800
and the toys will be more clean energy created than they were before, so the decarbonization effort

17:12.800 --> 17:19.840
would extend to decarbonizing our energy systems, our transport systems. All of those would receive

17:19.840 --> 17:26.000
carbon coins, and slowly but surely, even though you might have a quite active and productive

17:27.280 --> 17:32.720
society and civilization and economic system, it at least would be decarbonized.

17:32.720 --> 17:37.120
It wouldn't solve the other problems, and because there's no single solution here, and indeed my

17:37.120 --> 17:43.040
novel talks a lot about biosphere corridors, wildlife corridors. What now is being called the

17:43.040 --> 17:50.160
30 by 30 plans, they weren't even quite being discussed when I wrote the book in 2019, and yet

17:50.160 --> 17:54.720
now they're the law of the land because of this Montreal Treaty and because of the Ocean Treaty.

17:54.720 --> 17:58.880
Well, this is astonishing rapid progress on that front, and that's different than,

17:59.760 --> 18:04.480
that's different than economics, that's land use. It has an economic aspect to it, but again,

18:04.480 --> 18:10.560
it's part of, it's not exactly decarbonization, except it does draw down carbon if you leave

18:10.560 --> 18:16.880
wild land alone, but it's more having to do with biosphere health and having the wild animals

18:16.880 --> 18:21.840
not go extinct, so it is a big project. Let me extend that a little bit.

18:24.880 --> 18:30.000
I would argue that decarbonization, the way it's being promoted now is going to lead to a

18:30.000 --> 18:38.400
rematerialization, especially in the global south, and negative impacts on global ecologies in the

18:38.400 --> 18:45.200
countries where there's going to be massive copper and lithium and cobalt mining, etc.

18:45.200 --> 18:52.640
So I wonder if you extend the metaphor of the carbon coin in your book to be an ecology coin,

18:52.640 --> 18:59.600
things that are not only optimized for climate, but that are optimized for biosphere health,

18:59.600 --> 19:07.280
writ large, much wider boundary. I wonder if that would, I mean, part of the problem here

19:07.280 --> 19:13.280
is we're trying to optimize so many variables at once, but what do you think about that to

19:13.360 --> 19:20.560
extend it to a broader ecology coin? Well, I've certainly heard about this since my book came out

19:20.560 --> 19:27.920
in ways that are super interesting. There were people who are studying the fact that you can

19:27.920 --> 19:35.760
tell what's alive in a, in a biome, in a watershed by taking a water sample out of its streams and

19:35.760 --> 19:44.080
testing for DNA, and those tests have gotten so good and fine-tuned that you can tell everything

19:44.080 --> 19:50.080
that is alive in that watershed, and then you get a credit for it. Wait, you can just do a DNA test

19:50.080 --> 19:56.960
and it shows the species that live in that watershed? Yes. I didn't know that. Well, it's the ETH,

19:56.960 --> 20:03.360
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, is doing some work on this, and I can put you in

20:03.440 --> 20:09.040
contact with the people who are both studying that, and also could that be turned into a form

20:09.040 --> 20:14.320
of credit for the people living in that watershed? So this would be what you were describing, a kind

20:14.320 --> 20:19.760
of biosphere coin, that you would get renumerated or you would get, instead of destroying your

20:19.760 --> 20:25.760
watershed, extracting things and selling it for profit in the old economy, you would begin to be

20:25.760 --> 20:30.160
able to make your living by taking care of your watershed and keeping a whole lot of creatures

20:30.160 --> 20:36.240
alive in it, which you can prove they're alive by this water test of the DNA. Well, it's new and

20:36.240 --> 20:41.680
interesting. I'm totally in favor, long term, of something like that, and all these discussions,

20:41.680 --> 20:47.280
I think there's two questions. Where do we want to go, and what's sustainable, and how do we get

20:47.280 --> 20:52.640
there from here? And those are two different questions, but if we could have people making a

20:52.640 --> 21:00.640
living by doing things that are healthy for the ecology, isn't that a much better use of a Keynesian

21:00.640 --> 21:07.680
stimulus than just supporting people to buy flat screen TVs and take junket trips or whatever it

21:07.680 --> 21:15.680
is, just the consumption as usual? That's the cultural shift that I think could happen, would

21:15.680 --> 21:22.000
be a fantasy to happen, but I'm hopeful for in coming decades. Seems to me that what you're

21:22.000 --> 21:31.280
talking about is also that it's not economic, but it's more experiential or philosophical,

21:31.280 --> 21:39.280
or even a religious sensibility. In other words, what's life for? And many of us, and the way that

21:39.280 --> 21:44.320
you live your life, to a certain extent the way I live my life, although I'm a very conventional

21:44.320 --> 21:51.200
suburban guy still, but it's more interesting to do things than it is to watch things being done.

21:52.000 --> 22:00.160
This, of course, is a stab to the heart of our current cultural imaginary of

22:00.160 --> 22:06.080
social media and watching things on screens, a whole generational problem of your smart

22:06.080 --> 22:12.800
form, your laptop screen, your big wall TV, watching things. And then other people do them,

22:12.800 --> 22:21.520
and you watch them. This is so sapping of human spirit. It's so passive and observational.

22:22.080 --> 22:26.480
It's like a half-life. It's like a Philip K. Dick half-life. And many people

22:26.480 --> 22:32.240
live it because they haven't figured out that even just taking a walk down the lane to the

22:32.240 --> 22:36.640
local store would be more interesting than what they were doing, or throwing pebbles at a bottle

22:36.640 --> 22:41.600
on top of a fence top would be more interesting than these incredibly complicated computer games

22:41.600 --> 22:48.400
being played on a flat screen. The third dimension, bodily life in the real world,

22:48.400 --> 22:56.880
this is all more interesting than our artificial created advertising culture. So when people will

22:56.880 --> 23:02.640
get that, how people will get that, whether that becomes a general sensibility, I don't know.

23:02.640 --> 23:08.800
To me, it's as obvious as walking outdoors to other people, obviously not so much. So I don't

23:08.800 --> 23:14.480
know exactly how to make that turn. One thing I'll say is that my books are always about people

23:14.480 --> 23:19.680
doing stuff outdoors in the world. And maybe that's why my Washington DC novel was such a

23:19.680 --> 23:24.000
trial for me and for its readers. There were too many meetings and offices.

23:24.000 --> 23:29.120
Didn't you write one of your recent books fully while you were outside? I think I heard that

23:29.120 --> 23:34.960
somewhere. Oh, that's true for my last books since I finished that DC trilogy. I'm starting

23:34.960 --> 23:40.720
with Galileo's Dream, or even the last book of my DC trilogy. But for sure, Galileo's Dream

23:40.720 --> 23:45.360
in every book since, so that's about seven or eight books now I've written entirely outdoors.

23:45.360 --> 23:51.760
Now I'm in California, and in the winter I bundle up, in the summer I put a mister on. It can be

23:51.760 --> 23:56.720
cold, it can be hot. I have a tarp overhead, so the rain just falls around me when there is rain.

23:57.760 --> 24:04.000
And I work outdoors no matter what, very stubbornly, because it turned my writing into a little outdoor

24:04.000 --> 24:10.960
adventure. And it saved my brain. I was a burned out case at that point, and now I'm very energized.

24:11.760 --> 24:19.680
That's awesome. So you are a very busy person, Stan. This podcast has been scheduled for four

24:19.680 --> 24:26.240
months. After we hang up later, are you going to go outside and write? Are you writing a novel now?

24:27.440 --> 24:31.200
I'm not writing a novel now, and I'm antsy and feeling unhappy about it.

24:31.280 --> 24:38.000
But the Ministry for the Future has kind of eaten my life, and I'm currently like the cardboard cut

24:38.000 --> 24:44.160
out of the minister. I do a lot of events like this. And it's okay. I'm going to write a non-fiction

24:44.160 --> 24:52.960
book about Antarctica. So I'm quite excited about that. Have you been there? I have. I've been twice.

24:52.960 --> 25:04.240
So the first time was in 1995, and then I went again in 2016. I loved it. It was a big adventure.

25:04.240 --> 25:09.120
A little strand of memoir will be in this book, just like in my Sierra book, where it was a big

25:09.120 --> 25:14.640
strand. But in my Sierra book, I've been going to the Sierras for 50 years, and I've only gone

25:14.640 --> 25:20.320
twice. So that strand will be small. But there'll be history, geology, and a little bit more about

25:20.320 --> 25:24.400
this future plan of slowing the glaciers down so that we save sea level.

25:25.600 --> 25:32.320
So in ministry, you incorporate chapters from mostly unspecified, non-human, non-living perspectives.

25:32.320 --> 25:39.200
Why did you decide to incorporate these different perspectives, and what was your thought process

25:39.200 --> 25:44.080
while writing them and trying to get into the mindset of these creatures or entities?

25:44.080 --> 25:54.720
Well, thank you for that. I really enjoyed doing ministry as a kind of a miscellany, an anthology

25:54.720 --> 26:03.360
of different styles, and genres, and modes, and character types. So this is actor network theory

26:03.360 --> 26:10.560
out of Brunelatur, that our lives include very important contributions by creatures that aren't

26:10.560 --> 26:18.480
human. The animals in your life, the microbiota inside your gut, these are actors in your

26:18.480 --> 26:24.720
mentation and your life. And to write about that is a thing that literature ought to be doing

26:24.720 --> 26:30.240
that it hasn't done enough of, because it's somewhat of a new perception. So I was thoroughly enjoying

26:30.240 --> 26:37.680
that, and Anglo-Saxon literature can fit into one thick volume, all that we have left of it,

26:37.680 --> 26:42.880
and about a third of that volume is riddles. So I enjoyed having riddles of, oh, well,

26:42.880 --> 26:48.880
I am the thing that is always in control, but I never do anything. And so these riddle modes

26:48.880 --> 26:56.800
were fun for me. I also very much enjoyed the eyewitness account, which I began to understand

26:56.800 --> 27:02.320
as a new genre of its own that is not like fiction proper. The eyewitness account, you're usually

27:02.320 --> 27:08.720
being interviewed, it's like 10 years later, you don't dramatize the scene, you go really fast,

27:08.720 --> 27:13.520
and you judge what happened, what it meant to you and your life, what it meant to the world.

27:13.520 --> 27:18.800
So the eyewitness account is interesting, and there are bundles of them. There are books of all

27:18.800 --> 27:24.320
the things that women saw on their way on the Oregon Trail, or all of the things that happened

27:24.320 --> 27:32.800
in Germany in April of 1945, or the French Revolution, etc., etc. It's a mode of history,

27:32.800 --> 27:40.240
and when I realized I could do that for my future in ministry, it freed me up. And so it's not just

27:40.240 --> 27:47.040
a photon or a carbon atom, or the sun that I have speaking in the first person, it's also individual

27:47.040 --> 27:51.200
humans that you never learn their name, they never come back again, but they tell you something

27:51.200 --> 27:57.200
interesting that they saw and did, and that for me was the key that turned the lock. I was happy.

27:57.760 --> 28:04.720
So Stan, I recently did a podcast with climate modeling expert, Erica Thompson,

28:04.720 --> 28:11.280
where we discussed the idea that models in general can go way beyond computer

28:11.280 --> 28:18.560
programings, including the form of novels. So do you feel like the books that you write are a sort

28:18.560 --> 28:27.520
of mental model of the potential futures that you see that allow a human, even if they don't

28:27.520 --> 28:32.400
know the science or haven't taken a science course, it helps them construct a mental model?

28:34.000 --> 28:40.720
Yes, absolutely. I often compare it to modeling exercises, but then what you would want is to

28:40.720 --> 28:46.640
take the whole spread of science fiction stories and say each one is one run through from the

28:46.640 --> 28:53.360
initial conditions to a different outcome, like in any modeling exercise scenarios, it's good to

28:53.360 --> 29:00.320
compare them to scenario building. And the thing I would say that the novel brings to it, that the

29:00.320 --> 29:05.520
others don't have, and there are things the others have that novels don't. But what novels bring,

29:06.480 --> 29:13.680
some people call thick texture. And I think it's also just a time involvement and a giving of,

29:13.680 --> 29:19.600
a generous giving of time on the part of the reader who has to imagine those sentences on the page

29:20.320 --> 29:26.320
into some kind of internal lived experience. That takes effort, that takes hours. And when you're

29:26.320 --> 29:31.280
done, you feel like you've kind of lived it. If the novel has worked well, you feel like you've

29:31.280 --> 29:37.200
been there, done that, it's a time travel, it's telepathy, it's quite a magical thing, but it's

29:37.200 --> 29:42.560
all in the reader's head. And so it's a modeling exercise with some heft to it, because you've

29:42.560 --> 29:49.920
been there for a while and you've kind of lived it. So you've often spoken about narratives,

29:49.920 --> 29:55.040
especially speculative fiction as a powerful tool to envision

29:56.960 --> 30:03.600
positive change in the world. However, and despite its transformative intentions,

30:04.240 --> 30:13.200
a lot of clarify climate fiction so far has been dystopian. And there has been science showing

30:13.200 --> 30:21.120
that dystopia tends to reinforce the resignation to negative events, climate catastrophe, etc.

30:21.120 --> 30:26.960
What are your thoughts on that? I think that's right. And I think it's a really serious problem.

30:27.040 --> 30:35.120
I have become anti dystopian as a utopian science fiction writer. I've always had to acknowledge

30:35.120 --> 30:42.080
that these are two sides of a coin. Utopia dystopia, things could get better, things could get worse.

30:43.520 --> 30:49.360
It's dialectical, they both have their value in imagining. They're like the modeling exercises

30:49.360 --> 30:54.800
we just talked about, and you'd need negative models to convince you don't go that way. So

30:54.800 --> 31:02.000
dystopia has always had its use. Susan famously 1984 is a classic case of people saying they didn't

31:02.000 --> 31:08.240
want to go to the land of big brother and false information, which maybe we've ended up at anyway.

31:08.240 --> 31:14.480
But back to dystopias, there are now a kind of a comfort food. People read them or watch them on

31:14.480 --> 31:20.080
TV in order to feel like superior, like, well, things may be bad for me, but at least they're

31:20.080 --> 31:26.560
not that bad. And so you come away from them comforted. Is that why the the evening news at

31:26.560 --> 31:31.120
6pm, they always lead with all these bad things happening in the world and my mom is obsessed

31:31.120 --> 31:36.080
with watching the six o'clock news and it's all terrible? Because people, it makes them feel better

31:36.080 --> 31:42.640
about their current situation? Yes, I worry about that. But also, if it bleeds, it leads. When it's

31:42.640 --> 31:49.760
TV news, you need something that you can look at. So it can't be facts, it can't be a report,

31:50.080 --> 31:54.240
it has to be visual and you have to have been able to capture it at that moment. So it's always

31:54.240 --> 32:01.200
the aftermath of a crime, red lights, police tape, and a reporter outside going, oh, how horrible,

32:01.200 --> 32:06.720
look how horrible this is. And it's simply a desire for visible drama, something that they

32:06.720 --> 32:11.840
can get on tape within the within the day of what had happened or else it isn't new. So they're

32:11.840 --> 32:17.520
struck by a structural problem of the you can't get visible evidence of the important things

32:17.520 --> 32:24.400
that happened that day. So they're stuck with trivia. So the nexus of art and science on

32:24.400 --> 32:30.480
environmental catastrophe and risk to the future is a really fine line, isn't it? Because we have to

32:31.840 --> 32:40.800
create mental models in people's minds about the science of what is possible, but not so dystopian

32:40.800 --> 32:46.320
that they just check out there's got to be avenues for personal and cultural response.

32:47.760 --> 32:52.480
I think it's it's like what you say. And I think it's I call it a tightrope walk.

32:53.200 --> 32:59.120
You have to convince people to walk the tightrope with you of not falling off on either side.

32:59.120 --> 33:06.400
If you pay if you point out the danger that we're in, which is severe and existential,

33:06.400 --> 33:10.000
you know, breaking planetary boundaries, causing a runaway, hot house, earth.

33:10.960 --> 33:15.840
This is a mass extinction event. This is bad as it could get. So on the other hand,

33:16.560 --> 33:22.800
powers of people of society of science in theory, if we got to act together,

33:23.440 --> 33:30.800
a kind of a golden age of certainly the we have the tools and capacities to solve these problems

33:31.440 --> 33:36.480
and get into a good space. And so that's the other side of the of the tightrope falling

33:36.480 --> 33:41.760
off is say, oh, well, that's going to be okay. What gets called cruel optimism, where you just

33:41.760 --> 33:46.160
shrug and say, look, the experts will take care of this. I'm living my life. I don't need to worry

33:46.160 --> 33:51.280
about this. And indeed, you don't need to worry either way. If the world is going to hell in a

33:51.280 --> 33:55.840
handbasket, then there's nothing you can do about it. If the world is headed towards utopia,

33:55.840 --> 34:02.240
then you don't need to do anything about it. So the tightrope walk is very, it's very narrow.

34:02.240 --> 34:07.760
It really is a tightrope that you have to stay a balanced on it and say the situation is dangerous.

34:07.760 --> 34:12.640
There are things we can do and must do. And that's the line you have to hold to.

34:14.240 --> 34:21.760
In your book, Ministry for the Future, one of the beginning premises was that millions of people

34:21.760 --> 34:27.520
in the subcontinent of India died because of higher wet bulb combination of temperature and

34:27.520 --> 34:35.360
humidity. How much of that wet bulb India framing was science fiction? And how much of it is what

34:35.360 --> 34:42.880
you, Kim Stanley Robinson, actually believe about the future? Well, I'm terrified that it could happen.

34:42.880 --> 34:48.800
That is one of the main reasons I wrote Ministry for the Future was reading about the wet bulb 35

34:48.800 --> 34:56.240
limit of human endurance, which I read about in about 2017. And it wasn't that it was a new fact,

34:56.240 --> 35:02.240
it was that the scientific and medical communities had kind of combined. People in the climate

35:02.240 --> 35:06.560
community had been saying temperatures could get this high and people in the medical community

35:06.560 --> 35:11.680
were pointing out that would kill a person if you weren't in air conditioning, because we're not good

35:11.680 --> 35:18.960
at, we need to sweat off excess heat as bodily creatures. And that works in dry heat. In wet

35:18.960 --> 35:24.560
heat, it works far less well. And at wet bulb 35, which is, as you said, an index of heat and

35:24.560 --> 35:30.480
humidity in combination, then you die within several hours, whether or not you are in the

35:30.560 --> 35:35.440
shade or not, whether you have a fan on you or not, because sweating stops working at wet bulb

35:35.440 --> 35:41.520
35 in a way that you overheat internally. And hyperthermia will kill you just as fast as hypothermia.

35:42.400 --> 35:49.840
This was news to me. And when I read it, I thought the idea that humans could adapt to anything

35:50.960 --> 35:57.200
is a false one that, and this was a thought that was out there in the culture that, oh, humans

35:57.200 --> 36:01.520
are so adaptable. We'll just adapt to higher temperatures. Why are people so worried? This

36:01.520 --> 36:08.000
is sort of the view of what was called for a while the eco modernists, that essentially we're

36:08.000 --> 36:15.040
adaptable, we can solve any problems, quit worrying so much about the carbon burn and a global average

36:15.040 --> 36:21.520
temperature rise of four degrees Celsius. Big deal. Well, that turned out to be wrong. That's

36:21.520 --> 36:26.240
flatly wrong. And they don't say that anymore. And that's partly because of ministry for the future.

36:27.440 --> 36:33.520
I just put it out there that the news, the real news is that will kill us. And and vast swaths

36:33.520 --> 36:39.040
of the world, including the American Southeast and the Midwest, like I know where you live,

36:39.040 --> 36:43.360
the one of the hottest wet bulb temperatures ever recorded was right outside Chicago

36:44.080 --> 36:49.360
in the early 1990s. And it was one of those flukes that happened. But it goes to show that

36:49.360 --> 36:55.920
anywhere because it was so humid. Yeah, it was humid heat. It was like a wet bulb 32 or even wet

36:55.920 --> 37:05.840
bulb 34 for a couple hours. And well, a functioning electricity system will allow you to get shelter

37:05.840 --> 37:10.640
in air conditioning, you can save your life. But when the grid goes down and you don't have air

37:10.640 --> 37:15.040
conditioning, then you'd be doomed. And that's sort of why I put it in India. That's a place

37:15.040 --> 37:19.760
that's going to be very susceptible to these temperatures. It's got a weaker power grid

37:20.560 --> 37:25.280
that fails often. And that was that combination was what I wanted to

37:26.880 --> 37:33.280
indicate could be deadly soon. And so this isn't a real fear that I think a lot of people have,

37:33.280 --> 37:39.440
if they're paying attention, it's we are having heat waves, people are dying in them.

37:40.640 --> 37:48.240
I was in a wet bulb 31 in India last April, and I was interested because of having written my book,

37:48.240 --> 37:54.320
maybe interest is too weak of a word. I was highly apprehensive and it turned out it was no worse

37:54.320 --> 38:01.600
than a than a day in in Washington DC. You know, Washington DC during a hot summer's day steamy

38:01.600 --> 38:07.760
heat, it will it will cook you up quickly. And this day was no worse than that because it wasn't

38:07.760 --> 38:16.080
wet bulb 35. But we could get to that soon. So you know, this is a case of starting with dystopia,

38:16.160 --> 38:20.720
of starting a novel with something happening so horrible that it gets the world's attention.

38:20.720 --> 38:26.160
What I'm hoping is that since we know it can happen, we'll act before we have the disaster.

38:28.800 --> 38:34.320
Yeah, I have a lot of thoughts on that. But that would be like a whole other podcast because I think

38:36.000 --> 38:42.400
there's a systems challenge that we have and climate is but one of the risks that we face.

38:42.400 --> 38:50.640
And it's downstream of our culture optimizing for profits tethered to energy tethered to carbon.

38:51.280 --> 38:57.840
And so I personally don't think we are going to we will see foresee unless something radical happens.

38:57.840 --> 39:02.000
But I think to see is pretty baked in the cake and that's going to be bad enough. But we're going

39:02.000 --> 39:09.840
to have many other dystopian aspects to our future than just climate. So let me ask you

39:12.560 --> 39:18.240
a hard question maybe. What I'm really interested to see how you will respond

39:19.120 --> 39:25.280
is science fiction, not just your writing, but science fiction writ large, inherently techno

39:25.280 --> 39:32.480
optimistic, colonizing space and these things to me seem energy and ecology blind from a

39:32.480 --> 39:41.120
biophysical perspective. So I suppose books about an Earth Trek future where humans are using 80%

39:41.120 --> 39:47.600
less material throughput and it's a tougher material existence, but perhaps greater spiritual

39:47.600 --> 39:54.000
pursuits. That sort of book wouldn't actually be in the sci fi genre, it would be in something else.

39:54.560 --> 39:59.520
But do you have any thoughts on that? No, that would be a science fiction story and it's a good

39:59.520 --> 40:06.960
one. I'm going to make a simple cut and say science fiction is any story you set in the future.

40:07.760 --> 40:16.160
So UN demographers, stock forecasters, everybody that pitches their story into the future and says

40:16.160 --> 40:21.520
this is going to happen, they don't know that. The future is unknowable. So they're doing a

40:21.520 --> 40:28.560
science fiction story often it's disguised as nonfiction or as futureology or business prediction.

40:28.560 --> 40:34.480
It's often a scam because anybody who claims to know what the future is bringing is making a

40:34.480 --> 40:39.680
false claim. So you have to be suspicious of it. And one thing science fiction does, it says, look,

40:39.680 --> 40:45.280
this is a fiction. I'm making this up, but it's interesting anyway. And so if you put a story

40:45.280 --> 40:50.160
out like yours, this is a good sign. It's a form of utopian science fiction. Things could be better

40:50.160 --> 40:57.040
for these reasons. And that's the kind of science fiction I write all the time. I would agree with

40:57.040 --> 41:03.440
you the dream of space I've written about this often. And I talk about the solar system as our

41:03.520 --> 41:10.320
planetary neighborhood and actually amenable to human visitation in person, which would be more

41:10.320 --> 41:16.320
or less interesting, depending not that interesting, like going to Antarctica, useful, interesting,

41:16.320 --> 41:21.920
but not transformative. The dream of going to the stars is a fantasy, a false dream that's

41:21.920 --> 41:27.360
impossible. I wrote about this in Aurora. It made myself very unpopular with the people who write

41:27.360 --> 41:32.960
space fiction. Because I said, look, it's a great story space, like Middle Earth is a great story

41:32.960 --> 41:38.480
space, but it's not real. We're not going there. It's too far away. Humans co-evolved with Earth.

41:39.120 --> 41:45.280
We are stuck with Earth. That is not a bad thing. That is just part of being part of a planet.

41:45.280 --> 41:50.880
Planetary consciousness is very important. And you no more should complain about that than you would

41:51.600 --> 41:55.840
complain that you don't live on the inside of the sun or you're not an angel or you're not an ant

41:55.840 --> 42:01.760
or something. You're a human on planet Earth and you're a planetary creature. There's an

42:01.760 --> 42:08.000
interesting side case to be made that Mars, if we were to be in a good balance with Earth biosphere

42:08.000 --> 42:13.920
and a stable civilization, Mars could become an interesting scientific station, blah, blah. That's

42:13.920 --> 42:21.360
a separate and side issue, a kind of a random case. You can't see the same thing about Venus,

42:21.360 --> 42:26.400
for instance, or the surface of Jupiter. But Mars, you could land on it. You could live on it.

42:26.400 --> 42:30.240
You could set up a little space station there. A few people could live on it.

42:30.880 --> 42:38.080
A few people. Like Antarctica today, the best analogy for Mars is Antarctica,

42:38.080 --> 42:44.960
which we're there and nobody cares. And to me, it's Stephen, a very smart and famous people.

42:44.960 --> 42:52.800
Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, among them kind of say, we're screwing up Earth. Climate's

42:52.800 --> 42:58.960
going to be bad. We need to colonize outer space and head to Mars. And that makes just zero sense

42:58.960 --> 43:06.160
to me because on the worst thermonuclear runaway climate scenario, Earth is still going to be

43:06.160 --> 43:13.520
a paradise next to Mars. I agree with you completely. That is a case that has to be made. And the

43:13.520 --> 43:18.720
thing about people like Hawking's, the thing about people like Elon Musk is they're smart.

43:18.720 --> 43:24.960
They aren't that smart. They aren't wise. They aren't philosophers. And they are not ecologists.

43:24.960 --> 43:30.160
Very often physicists will assume that ecology is just physics in action and that they've got it

43:30.160 --> 43:35.680
all sussed out because they know the rules of physics and they can do rocketry. But you can't

43:35.680 --> 43:42.480
do plant biology just knowing rocketry. It's more complex. It's more interconnected. It's a

43:42.480 --> 43:47.280
more complex science. And many physicists will arrogantly say that because I know the laws of

43:47.280 --> 43:54.880
physics, I know everything, but they don't know how Mars works. They haven't studied biology enough

43:54.960 --> 43:59.760
to understand their own ignorance. So how smart are you if you don't know how ignorant you are?

44:01.760 --> 44:06.640
Homo sapiens, we have not yet lived up to our moniker. I think we've been more clever man

44:06.640 --> 44:16.800
than wise man. Let's hope. Homo Faber, humans, the makers. That's to me the best name. We do

44:16.800 --> 44:28.880
make things and it's a real skill. So do you think in your writing you've often advocated for

44:28.880 --> 44:38.880
a rewilding of Earth? I assume you're aware of E. L. Wilson's notion of half Earth as one of the

44:38.880 --> 44:45.600
key solutions to the future. Is this possible? Are there any signs that we could eventually do

44:45.600 --> 44:54.000
this in coming decades? Yes, I think there is. I love E. L. Wilson and his biofilia. He's a very

44:54.000 --> 44:59.520
important public intellectual and philosopher, recently deceased, but I honor his memory and he

44:59.520 --> 45:07.680
will be remembered like Ben Franklin or William James as an important American thinker. And half

45:07.680 --> 45:12.880
Earth was crucial when it came out, but I thought it was quite utopian. And now we already have 30

45:12.880 --> 45:19.200
by 30. All the nations on Earth have agreed to keep 30% of their lands wild by the year 2030.

45:19.200 --> 45:23.600
China forced that deal through, which is super interesting. And now we have the same thing

45:23.600 --> 45:29.840
for the oceans just completed after 10 years of negotiation. These are super hopeful signs

45:29.840 --> 45:34.240
that are under reported in the news because people don't get it because they are indeed

45:34.240 --> 45:42.160
living inside their social media and their laptops. So if you spent time outdoors, you

45:42.160 --> 45:46.720
would realize that if 30% of the Earth's surface was left to the wild creatures and they became

45:46.720 --> 45:53.360
healthy by that. And I'm told by the woman who runs the 30 by 30 program in California, which is

45:53.360 --> 46:00.880
a formal state program, that we're at 24%. And that everybody in that pursuit talks about 30 by 30,

46:00.880 --> 46:07.760
then 50 by 50, which would be the half Earth project by the year 2050. And yes, humans can indeed

46:08.400 --> 46:13.200
do their agriculture and compress into the cities, which young people want to anyway, you wouldn't

46:13.200 --> 46:20.320
have to force the issue. Organize our management of the landscapes in ways that don't mean pure

46:20.320 --> 46:26.320
wilderness like humans never get to go here. That would be unusual in the extreme. But land use that

46:26.320 --> 46:33.840
opens up the land to the wild animals and they get to live their lives unencumbered by us.

46:33.840 --> 46:41.680
And then we live on the other 50% in ways that are intelligently managed in biosphere sense. So

46:41.680 --> 46:49.280
we're helping also even on the land that we're on. Well, this is the plan. It's maybe the most

46:49.280 --> 46:54.400
important part of the plan going forward, although you want to have a way to pay for it, etc.

46:55.360 --> 47:04.000
But I hope that can happen. Even if it were to happen, though, it really isn't 30 or 50,

47:04.000 --> 47:10.240
because the 30 or 50 assumes that everything else in the biosphere is constant. And we know that the

47:10.240 --> 47:18.480
climate and other biogeochemical feedbacks are going to accelerate. So that 30% of ecosystems,

47:18.480 --> 47:25.280
what it supports today, 20, 30 years from now, climate will have an impact on it, obviously.

47:26.080 --> 47:32.080
Yeah, it's true. And I think you're just pointing out realities here that everybody ought to know.

47:33.840 --> 47:40.320
For that reason, there are some wildlife ecologists and conservation biologists talking

47:40.320 --> 47:45.360
about making sure these corridors established for the wild creatures have room for them,

47:45.360 --> 47:51.600
the migrate northward in the northern hemisphere, to get away from the heat. And you mentioned the

47:52.400 --> 47:58.080
inevitability, almost, of us creating a two degree Celsius rise in average temperature.

47:58.080 --> 48:04.560
That's looking very, very likely, as you know, that's why you said it. So I'm saying that means

48:04.560 --> 48:09.120
we're going to have to suck down a lot of CO2 out of the atmosphere. That's going to be a project.

48:09.680 --> 48:15.440
Regenerative agriculture, reforestation, and even mechanical vacuum cleaners sucking it out of the

48:15.440 --> 48:22.800
air, everything is going to have to be applied to get us back down to, I don't know, 350 parts per

48:22.800 --> 48:29.280
million. It makes sense. I mean, there's a reason Bill McKibben chose it as the name of his organization.

48:29.280 --> 48:34.240
We could do it if we don't have a runaway that blows out our abilities to do it.

48:34.240 --> 48:42.720
Well, we could do it. Stan, I don't think you've watched much of my material because you're so

48:42.720 --> 48:51.280
busy and we just recently met. But one of my recent framings is I call it Mordor or the Great

48:51.280 --> 48:57.600
Simplification. The Great Simplification is when we can no longer kick the can financially,

48:58.160 --> 49:04.800
and the amount of financial claims we've created crashed down in a snapping rubber band to our

49:04.800 --> 49:09.840
biophysical reality, which means a smaller economy and smaller emissions going forward.

49:09.840 --> 49:17.840
On the other hand, if we are able to do more carbon finance trickery and quantitative easing

49:17.840 --> 49:24.320
number nine or whatever, we'll continue to grow the gross amount of energy that the world uses,

49:24.400 --> 49:31.440
which results in GDP. But the net amount of energy that goes to hospitals and science fiction books

49:31.440 --> 49:37.920
and Disneyland and shopping centers, that is going to be more and more directed towards the

49:37.920 --> 49:43.280
energy and mining sector itself. They're going to need to use more to get the lower quality

49:43.280 --> 49:52.640
resources and the mechanical vacuum cleaners and things like that, that take care of our

49:52.640 --> 49:59.360
environmental waste. So a much larger percentage of GDP will go to energy and environmental

49:59.360 --> 50:05.440
remediation. So in that scenario, the rest of the economy gets priced out a little bit.

50:07.360 --> 50:12.640
If we're going to get down to 350, if that were to be a cultural objective, which I

50:12.640 --> 50:18.160
am skeptical on, we would have to give up a lot of other things in order to make that the primary

50:19.120 --> 50:20.400
focus. Yes?

50:22.480 --> 50:31.920
Maybe. I take your point. It makes sense. I am interested in the people who are talking about

50:31.920 --> 50:41.920
things like regenerative agriculture, that we could both grow our food and capture more carbon

50:42.000 --> 50:46.960
in the soil that we grow our food in. So we have more biosphere health,

50:49.120 --> 50:55.440
as much food, and more CO2 sucked out of the atmosphere all at once. I'm always looking to

50:55.440 --> 51:00.960
these multiple goods where we need food, but we also need less CO2 in the atmosphere if we can

51:00.960 --> 51:08.880
do both at once, which is a technique. And agriculture is a science and a technique that

51:08.880 --> 51:16.320
people spend a whole lot of time studying. Right now, in the fields of America, especially

51:16.320 --> 51:24.640
corn and soy, the carbon in the soil by weight is down to about 1%. And it could be that with some

51:26.080 --> 51:31.360
changes to agricultural methods, we could begin to draw down. And it tops out pretty quickly.

51:31.360 --> 51:36.960
You can't get more than 3% or 4% of carbon by weight in the soil before you have kind of

51:36.960 --> 51:41.440
topped out that soil. It's not an infinite bank, but it's so much soil.

51:41.920 --> 51:50.400
So just hypothetically, if we went from 1% carbon by weight in the soil to 3% globally,

51:50.400 --> 51:56.240
just hypothetically, what would that do to drawing down the carbon roughly? Do you have

51:56.240 --> 52:04.000
any idea? Well, it's incredible. And yet it's apparently true that that is enough carbon to

52:04.000 --> 52:08.320
that's as much carbon as we've burned out into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution

52:08.320 --> 52:15.680
began. Really? So yes, it's an enormous sink. Now, I mean, I'm told this by people who are

52:15.680 --> 52:20.240
studying it, I am still a science fiction writer, I'm a reporter, but I'm telling you,

52:20.240 --> 52:27.120
there are people who say this. Well, I'm actually a lot more sanguine about regenerative agriculture

52:27.120 --> 52:37.360
than the mechanized vacuum cleaners. So if you have any world expert on regenerative agriculture,

52:37.360 --> 52:42.960
you could introduce me to and I can take a deep dive on that publicly on a podcast. I would welcome

52:42.960 --> 52:47.920
that. What are your thoughts on... I can do that. I've just run into those people. I am going to

52:47.920 --> 52:54.960
write that down. Okay, awesome. Thank you. What are your thoughts on geoengineering? Will we eventually

52:54.960 --> 52:59.440
be faced with the obvious, oh my God, look at what's happening with climate and we'll have

52:59.440 --> 53:06.960
to try it? Are you morally against it? Are you hopeful of some of the science there or what do

53:06.960 --> 53:16.000
you think? I think it might be a break glass in case of emergency type operation. I am not morally

53:16.000 --> 53:21.280
against it. We've already geoengineered this earth to within an inch of its life. That's

53:21.360 --> 53:27.760
called climate change and biosphere collapse. Civilization has been geoengineering all along.

53:28.720 --> 53:34.000
Right to the beginning of burning down Australia when humans first arrived there, etc. So it's an

53:34.000 --> 53:40.720
old practice. Now, if we needed to do it because people were dying all over the tropics because of

53:40.720 --> 53:47.120
wet bulb 35 temperatures happening all the time, then this thing people talk about of casting dust

53:47.120 --> 53:54.560
into the atmosphere and imitating a penitubo type volcanic eruption, dropping worldwide

53:54.560 --> 53:59.040
temperatures for a degree or two for five years after which the dust falls back to the ground.

54:00.720 --> 54:06.160
I think the real issues there are governance issues. How do we decide to do it? How do we get

54:06.160 --> 54:12.560
public buy-in and it doesn't look like some weird Dr. Strange-Levian type experiment with the earth

54:12.560 --> 54:19.040
itself? We've already been experimenting with the earth itself in ridiculously bad ways and a lot

54:19.040 --> 54:25.040
of times in ignorance of what we were doing. So this would be being done on purpose in full

54:25.040 --> 54:30.240
knowledge of what we were doing. I think we should study it. I think we should discuss the governance

54:30.240 --> 54:39.040
of it. There are also more, what can I say, less alarming versions of geoengineering. For instance,

54:39.120 --> 54:43.680
if you slow down the glaciers in Antarctica, you can call that geoengineering, but there are no

54:43.680 --> 54:49.680
negative side effects that I know of. Then there are people talking about the whales that when we

54:49.680 --> 54:56.800
killed off 95% of the whales on this planet, we wrecked the ocean's bio pump, which is also a

54:56.800 --> 55:04.160
nice carbon drawdown mechanism, and that replacing the whales. Since you can't just replace whales,

55:04.160 --> 55:11.520
you can replace whale poop, which is a chemical formulation, a kind of living bio excrement

55:11.520 --> 55:18.640
of whales dropped into the ocean would create the same biospheric conditions that existed

55:18.640 --> 55:24.880
before we wrecked it. So this would also be geoengineering in a peculiar way and is being

55:24.880 --> 55:30.640
discussed. So the topic is huge and I don't want to go into all of the rabbit holes involved there,

55:30.640 --> 55:35.840
but I certainly think that it's something that people should be able to talk about it

55:35.840 --> 55:40.800
without a sense of shock and awe or, oh my God, there are some things man was not meant to know

55:40.800 --> 55:46.400
type mentality. I mean, we're far past that. We are in an emergency situation and certain

55:46.400 --> 55:52.400
emergency gestures may become necessary that we don't get a runaway into a hot house earth, which

55:52.400 --> 56:03.280
could happen. Do you ever get the sense or just this like deja vu weird sense looking at the news

56:03.280 --> 56:11.360
and looking around the world that we are living a science fiction novel reality that none of you

56:11.360 --> 56:17.280
writers could have imagined 20 or 30 years ago. Every day, there's just crazy stuff happening

56:17.280 --> 56:23.920
left right and center. And it's almost like the Twilight Zone. This is like a real Twilight

56:23.920 --> 56:31.200
Zone meets reality TV our lives. Well, yes, I've been saying this for about 25 years. We are in a

56:31.200 --> 56:36.880
science fiction novel that we are all co authoring together. And what I mean is the future is crashing

56:36.880 --> 56:42.000
us that that there's the great acceleration has accelerated yet again, and everything's happening

56:42.000 --> 56:46.960
faster than we can come to grips with. And that's what a science fiction novel is trying to capture

56:47.040 --> 56:53.120
is that feeling. So for sure. But what you would want, although Twilight Zone was a great show,

56:53.920 --> 56:59.520
you would want something more like I don't know Ursula K. Le Guin's The Dispissed, which which

56:59.520 --> 57:05.200
actually is very troubled and filled with revolutions and conflict. So it's not like you're

57:05.200 --> 57:09.840
going to dodge revolutions and conflict here because we're in the midst of it. It's a very

57:11.040 --> 57:15.120
melodramatic science fiction novel that we're caught in the middle of and we just have to try

57:15.120 --> 57:23.440
to write it towards utopia. I actually posted on Twitter a month ago that I my entire life is

57:23.440 --> 57:32.000
filled with nonfiction and I needed some fiction recommendations and I had 1000 replies. And Ursula

57:32.000 --> 57:36.880
K. Le Guin's Dispissed was like among the most popular ones. So I just bought it. I have it

57:36.880 --> 57:42.640
outside. I've not read it. That's good. So are all those books behind you? Are those all science

57:42.640 --> 57:51.840
fiction books? No, that's a non this is a nonfiction shelf. I keep John Muir. This is accidental,

57:51.840 --> 57:56.720
but I have a full shelf of John Muir and then a full shelf of California nonfiction and the top

57:56.720 --> 58:04.320
shelf is Antarctica. I see a really long shelf of Antarctica. That might be the 90% of Antarctica

58:04.320 --> 58:09.520
in literature right there. So just out of curiosity, how many hours a week do you spend reading?

58:09.920 --> 58:19.360
Oh, well, a lot. I read nonfiction by day and I I treat it instrumentally. I almost strip

58:19.360 --> 58:26.160
mind my nonfiction to get what I need for my fiction. So I read nonfiction all day and but

58:26.160 --> 58:34.880
I'm writing also, I reckon it must add up to a couple three hours of reading per day of nonfiction.

58:34.880 --> 58:39.920
And then every night when I go to bed, I read fiction for about a half hour or an hour.

58:39.920 --> 58:44.800
Depends on how long I can stay awake. But I'm always reading a novel and when I finish one,

58:44.800 --> 58:52.960
I start another one. And I love it. I love reading fiction. Reading nonfiction, I don't love,

58:52.960 --> 58:58.800
but it's important. It's part of my work. It's good literary hygiene that you've described two

58:58.800 --> 59:05.200
hours of nonfiction half hour of fiction before bed. Yeah, yeah. And I let and I must say,

59:05.200 --> 59:10.400
read a novel when you go to bed and you'll be absorbed you'll fall asleep in a different world.

59:10.960 --> 59:15.760
You'll live that life. It will be the best part of your day or let's put it this way,

59:15.760 --> 59:21.600
you'll look forward to it every day. Oh, good. Now I get to dive into like right now I'm reading

59:21.600 --> 59:28.000
the ragged, trousered philanthropists, a British working class novel from about 1904,

59:28.000 --> 59:34.160
very funky, very serious, very sad, very intense working class life when you were in

59:34.160 --> 59:39.200
the precarity, precarity really means it when you're going to die if you lose your job

59:39.840 --> 59:45.280
and your family too. And then I'm also reading Freddie the Pig and the baseball team from Mars,

59:45.280 --> 59:50.000
a children's book that I read when I was a child. Obviously, it had a big impact on me since I still

59:50.000 --> 59:55.280
play softball and I still write about Mars. And then sort of lighten the load. I usually just read

59:55.280 --> 01:00:00.240
one novel at a time to tell you the truth. I think that's the best way you join that world.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:05.440
But in this case, I'm kind of lightening the load of the ragged trouser philanthropists.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:16.480
Well, lightening the load is is part of the, you know, the recipe to remain sane in these times,

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:24.160
because you and I in the stories we're trying to share with society, this stuff can get toxic

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:29.760
reading and learning. Like you said, a few years ago, you learned about wet bulb 35. I just learned

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:38.320
about that two years ago. And you just add these things. And the human physiology and our genome

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.800
didn't evolve to handle this much toxic information about our world. So we need antidotes. I have

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.640
dogs and I live in a forest, but I also like fiction reading as well.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:56.000
Well, I think that what I read about you before we got on this podcast, that this that you figured

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.280
it out, that you're living on the land, you're paying attention to a particular piece of land,

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.960
and you've got other animals, companion species, that you're taking care of and helping and they're

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:13.200
helping and teaching you things to you as an animal, that this is what everybody, if everybody

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.960
had it figured out to that extent. And even you can you can you can live a life in an apartment

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:23.920
in Manhattan that includes these things if you've got it figured out in the first place. So it's

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:31.760
really a matter of understanding what we are and then adapting living your life to accommodate what

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.640
we really are, which is animals and social primates and all the things that we obviously are.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:44.240
The more you embrace that and live it rather than sitting on your butt looking at screens all day

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:49.920
every day, that will drive you mad. And so we live in a culture that's slightly mad.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:58.480
I agree. Thank you for that. I'm not sure I have it all figured out and I do still need to read

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:08.240
the equivalent of Freddie the pig at night. So key question here, climate and to a lesser extent

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:15.600
biodiversity and PFAS and endocrine disruptors and all these other things are becoming more aware

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:23.440
and teenage humans are coming into learning about the world and learning all this stuff.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:30.800
And I've taught a college course for eight of the last 10 years. In my experience, there's a lot

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.040
of scary material at the, you know, I don't know how many tens of thousands of climate courses there

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:43.200
are in high school and college, but worldwide. And there's scary material. This is what's

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.800
happening in the climate. These are the scenarios. This is what's going to happen in the 21st century.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:51.840
But there's kind of too narrow a solution set just at the end of the semester as well. We

01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:58.800
switch to renewables, you drive an EV or we end capitalism. But do you think that we're approaching

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:06.080
a time when there could be more systemic story and recommendations to young people that involves

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:13.280
behavior change from within like being happy with social natural human capital rather than

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:20.320
financial status? You know, what are your thoughts on this? Are we are we approaching young people

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.520
with the right message on on all these systemic crises?

01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:33.120
I don't know. It's a good question. It speaks to what Raymond Williams called a structure of feeling

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:39.840
that a civilization has a structure of feeling that is cultural. It's not biological. And it

01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:46.960
and it changes over time at different historical moments. I think actually of the the list that

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:52.000
you made ending capitalism, if young people are being talked to about that, that would be crucial.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.080
I don't think they are. They live in capitalist realism where they're going to be told

01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:01.840
typically nothing can ever change. This is the system you have to plug into it. The system is

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.200
unchangeable. And that's not true. The system is changeable and has to change because biosphere

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:13.360
reality is forcing change. So may they might be aware that change is coming fast and it isn't

01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.400
planned and it's going to be incomprehensible. I see a lot of climate dread, a lot of anxiety

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:22.960
the young people, a sense that well, we're doomed but ready. And no matter what we do,

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:29.840
we're just on a downhill slide into chaos and disorder, which is not an inaccurate assessment

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:37.360
of the way things feel for sure. And you can't change the feeling just by pushing a button or

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.320
saying some magic words. You actually have to change the political economy that you're in

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:47.680
to one that's more life positive. So ending capitalism would be one big,

01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.880
I mean, geez, when you say it, it's just so radical. I would say now reforming capitalism

01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.800
extremely rapidly to getting to something that is more like cooperatives. It is post capitalism

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:04.400
in its first step. That would be a big step and we aren't really there but we're trembling on the

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:11.120
brink. I think also there was a world order working in the neoliberal times, say the 1990s,

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.360
that isn't working anymore because it doesn't take into account the biosphere or what we really

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:20.880
are as creatures. And yet there's now 8 billion of us. So the old system isn't working. The new

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:26.480
system hasn't yet been invented. This is often talked about the in between the interagnum between

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:33.120
one system and the other. It feels frightening because you can't, despite me being a science

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:38.240
fiction writer, what I can say from that is you can't see the future. You can't predict the future.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:44.800
There's too many factors and it's changing too fast. So I mean there's reason for everybody to

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:51.360
feel anxiety and climate dread but what you can do and say to the young people is solutions are

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:57.040
out there. Let's make the solutions happen. Let's work together on the solutions. You'll be one

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.400
little brick and a giant wall but the wall is possible. We can build that wall and you put

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:08.000
your brick into place and you'll be part of that historical wave, that movement that changed

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.560
this generation is tasked with a really heavy task to dodge a mass extinction event

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:21.440
that previous generations started mostly by accident. Well, tough assignment and people

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:27.440
will be freaking out the entire time and even fighting against you the entire time. So it couldn't

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:34.880
be weirder, harder and all you can do is try to call out for solidarity, put your shoulder to the

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:41.120
wheel and fight the good fight anyway. So do you ever speak to younger audiences in addition

01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:47.280
to your activist message that you just described? What sort of advice do you give to teenage humans

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:55.760
who are old enough to intellectually understand this stuff but not yet sucked into the consumptive

01:06:55.760 --> 01:07:04.080
vortex of modern society? Do you have personal advice to young teenage or early 20 humans?

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:11.680
Yes, I talk to all the schools in Davis on a regular basis because I have teacher friends who

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:17.040
asked me to come by and in Davis it's easy and then I talk to college students all over the world

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:22.960
in literally the case and they're young enough that they're forming their ideologies, they're

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:27.120
figuring out their ways in life, they're thinking about what they're going to do with their lives

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:35.280
and they're very active and open-minded. That's the crowd to talk to I think and it's a privilege

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:40.880
to talk to them, I try to learn from them and listen to them as much as I can and what I just say

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:45.520
to them is no matter what you're interested in and you can follow your interests, follow your

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:51.040
nose, I'm interested in art, I'm interested in engineering, I'm interested in plant biology and

01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:57.280
why bugs eat plants and why plants are protected from bugs, whatever you're interested in,

01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:04.320
it's a climate change project now. You can be anything, a sculptor or an accountant,

01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:11.520
someone measuring things and engineering for sure, well it's going to be climate change work,

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.280
there will be work for you that's good work and here's how I try to encourage them.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:23.280
When I was in younger middle age there was a joke, the one who dies with the most toys wins,

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:34.160
it was a bumper sticker and it was making fun of and expressing the meaningless cynicism of

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:41.360
middle-class American society circa 1990, it was an 80s thing, a 90s thing, people were worried,

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.360
the capitalist wheel of birth and death, you work all your life then you die, nothing matters,

01:08:47.360 --> 01:08:52.880
I mean what's the point here, so this is what the bumper sticker was making a joke about,

01:08:53.440 --> 01:09:00.400
whoever dies with the most toys wins, obviously stupid, absurd, a lack of meaning and this was

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:05.760
the problem. Well now I can say to young people, your life has meaning, we are in a crisis,

01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:13.840
everything you do can actually fight for the people of the future, it's a cause and so life

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:19.760
has meaning, it may be a rather scary and desperate meaning but it's better than no meaning at all,

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:25.600
which was the previous problem that's completely gone away, so sometimes I try to cheer them up,

01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:28.960
you know you're lucky to have climate change because otherwise you'd be in an existential

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:34.000
despair because capitalist reality is totally stupid and you've got to get past that.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:40.720
Yeah two comments there, first I remember seeing that bumper sticker, I didn't know it was a joke,

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:47.440
I thought people actually believed that, I didn't know and secondly yeah, I've heard this from a

01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:54.880
lot of my students and colleagues, we have a lack of meaning in our culture right now,

01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:03.200
you know kind of the theology of past religions and then the theology of economic growth

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:10.240
are waning and what is it all for, what is our purpose and what other purpose can there be

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:18.000
in my opinion than the viability of the ecosystems on our planet for the long term,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.120
to me it all comes back to that and climate's a piece of that but it's not the only piece.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:29.200
It's not the only piece, yeah, so you're living in Wisconsin and it's a Wisconsin guy,

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:36.000
Aldo Leopold, what's good is what's good for the land, well this is a very powerful statement,

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.960
very powerful, it's a philosophy, it's a religion and when he said the land I think he means all

01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:50.080
the living things that make up the land of course, it's easily understood and it's incredibly

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:57.680
powerful as an ethos but also as a decider, you can say well what's good, I mean you've got your

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:02.320
opinion, I've got my opinion, you can't determine it but what's good is what's good for the land

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.440
because that's what'll be passed on to the other animals and to the generations to come so

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:16.080
the Leopoldian land ethic as it's called in ethics and philosophy classes and ecology classes,

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:24.640
this is a very, very high statement of how you can, in a single phrase, you can make up a new

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:34.480
religion that makes sense. I love that, you know in my job now I'm non-ideological because I'm

01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:42.400
trying to unite many different groups of humans towards a common, you know, path that's going to

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:51.920
face all of us so I'm apolitical but if I do have an ideology it's what you just said,

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:58.800
it's that I deeply care about the ecosystems and other species and irrespective of everything else

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:04.240
that I write and speak about, at the end of the day that is something that I have no shame to tell

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:10.560
at the rooftops to any political group or age group or that's what really matters

01:12:11.440 --> 01:12:18.800
during our times right now. I'll just throw that back at you unintendedly, what do you care most

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:26.080
about in the world? I mean you're a very accomplished author and activist but like at the end of the

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.920
day what I think I could probably guess but I'll ask you anyways because I ask all my guests what

01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:38.160
do you care most about in the world Stan? Well I'm just like everybody else, the answers are

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:46.080
immediate and instinctive, I care about my family, my friends, my community, I care about animals in

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:51.920
a way that I didn't when I was younger. I just recently went to India for the first time and what

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.520
I noted immediately was they live their lives with animals still as part of daily town life

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:04.800
in a way that's incredibly beautiful and inspiring but maybe I'll turn it back and I just want to say

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:14.880
that um an ideology is the imaginary relationship to the real situation and therefore everybody has

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:22.240
one and has to have one. If you don't have one that would be a mental disability quite severe

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:27.680
so we all have that imaginative relationship to the real conditions of existence which is what an

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:33.600
ideology is so you have one too and that translates to a politics which you have one too. It can be

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:40.080
ecumenical, it can be directed to a particular kind of point that tries to transcend stupid

01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:48.400
partisan divides in the current mediated American landscape or older visions of left

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:54.800
and right etc etc etc. Sure those are deserved to be transcended in some kind of biophilia,

01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:01.520
some kind of land ethic, we'll do this for the good of our land in the local area, all the

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:06.320
creatures on it including the humans and that will be you know that's a little vague, it's more like

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:13.440
a religion than a politics but it can go to a politics. Yeah there we go, we are looking at

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:22.240
biophilia by Edward O. Wilson, Edward Wilson, beautiful concept. Yeah I have almost all his books

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:28.800
and I agree with what you said earlier. Um what uh well actually I wonder if I have uh

01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:37.440
uh well he oh yeah here I have this book um The Superorganism by Yeo Wilson uh I wrote an

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:45.280
academic paper about the superorganism um which I'll send to you so um in all of your travels

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:52.800
and your lectures to young people and and your work what things have you noticed or experienced

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:58.800
in the last couple years since ministry came out that really give you hope and motivation

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:05.520
about coming decades despite all the craziness in the Twilight Zone-esque uh sci-fi world we're living

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:15.520
in? Well it's a little um technical but it's true I've been encouraged by the 30 by 30 movements and

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:22.560
the COP 15 the biosphere um treaty in Montreal that the Chinese hosted with the Canadians

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:30.480
last year astonishing the ocean treaty just signed astonishing these are big victories

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.720
and even though they're just promises that nation states make to each other in other words they can

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:43.280
be broken by other people later on those promises matter because it's a putting forth of uh statements

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.960
of intent and that these things are important I learned that there's a network for greening

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:57.360
the financial system that is uh owned and operated by and and joined by about 90 of the biggest

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:04.000
central banks on earth including the super big ones out of the G7 and the G20 although central

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:09.760
banks are trying to green the financial system such that there is- That sounds like an oxymoron to me.

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:16.640
Well but but that that's uh that would be bad if it was an oxymoron you want to correct that um the

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:23.920
money needs to be spent which is to say human labor needs to be expended and you have to be

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:29.520
able to make your living doing good biosphere work rather than bad biosphere. Oh so this gets

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.880
back to the ecology coin we talked about earlier something like that. Yeah yeah and and uh you

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:39.440
can look it up the network for greening the financial system has a website it has a white

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:44.960
paper with nine suggestions they they're pretty technical like two of them I don't even understand

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:52.320
but what they're really saying is that money itself is a political act the and the fact that

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:57.120
everybody believes in money and you can go down and stick a piece of plastic into a slot and then

01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:03.600
someone will give you a cup of coffee so that's that kind of belief is very deep and cooperative

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:11.360
belief in money if money itself was greened at the roots and is being made up at its very start

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:19.120
by central banks and this is fiat money in other words the US dollar being spent on green projects

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:25.920
first and then circulating in the general economy of that itself might drive a lot of

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:33.920
restoration actions and might allow us to dodge the mass extinction of it. I will I will look into

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:40.240
that I think I at least partially agree with that but with a big old asterisk stand which is

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:48.400
as long as we have GDP as our global cultural goal we will burn more energy and consume more

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:53.920
stuff and if we get more efficient we're just going to burn more so if we have a an overlay in

01:17:54.000 --> 01:18:00.000
there of green of where the money goes into something green first I have to think about

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.240
how that would work. No and no I take your point and both of the things you said are right GDP is

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:15.200
wrong it is a rubric an index and a way of measuring human civilization that is flatly wrong

01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:23.120
and destructive and so growth of which is usually a shorthand for growth of GDP that's a growth of

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:30.960
destruction and is like a cancer so human development index gross national happiness this is a

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:38.880
Bhutanese thing other indexes that rate the human economic efforts by a different set of standards

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:46.320
these are crucial that's a crucial part of the work. So if you could wave a magic wand and there

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:52.320
was no personal recourse to your actions what is one thing that you would do to improve human

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.960
and planetary futures and as a science fiction author I imagine you have dozens of such ideas.

01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:09.520
I don't know I I mean it all it sounds so instrumentalist or technical and maybe I

01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:14.240
should put it at the level of the structure of feeling like you've been talking about a different

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:23.600
attitude towards life. I mean some of it is absolutely simplistic if people would spend

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:31.840
more time outdoors it would reorient their sense of reality in fundamental ways that changes the

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:38.160
view of everything. We spend too much time indoors we live in boxes looking at boxes this is silly

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:44.080
stuff and it's distorting our sense of what's real and what's important so I mean that's a

01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:51.040
little simple you could also go technical like I have been in most of this talk if fiat money was

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:58.160
created with a good green spending of it first off the bat then many other things would be better

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:05.200
30 by 30 if I could if I could instantly say that 50 percent of the earth and the ocean were left

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.600
to the other animals and that we concentrated our activities on 50 percent of the earth and 50

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:17.840
percent of the oceans if I could wave that magic wand and here's the thing people are already waving

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:24.880
it the 30 by 30 thing is profound when I first read the Yale Wilson book half earth I thought

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:31.920
beautiful idea will never happen and here 20 years later it's happening well I'm stunned and

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:36.880
now here it's worth following for a second why is that happening I think everybody

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:43.600
at the level of decision making and policy and also all well-meaning citizens who understand

01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:47.760
that their lives depend on science and what they're scared for their lives they run to a scientist

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:52.400
which is to say their doctor they looked at the evidence they've taken it in they've realized

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:58.720
we're in a biosphere emergency and that civilization will crash if the biosphere crashes and we've only

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:04.240
got 10 or 15 years to cope with it but it's better than having only one week to cope with it

01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:09.440
which we couldn't do and it's better than having 500 years to cope with it because we wouldn't pay

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:15.280
attention so we're in an emergency and people are acting like it but it's an actionable

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.000
emergency space in other words we've got this 10 or 15 years and I think the good things are

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.680
happening because there are so many people who actually know this now and they are doing something

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:35.440
about it. So last just personal question how many hours a day you live in California so

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.840
that's different than Wisconsin but how many hours a day do you actually spend outside

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:46.480
and how is that different from 10 or 15 years ago? Well because I moved my writing life outdoors

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:52.560
and my recreational life which is you know an hour of throwing frisbee golf at a running pace

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:57.120
with my friend and going for a walk with my wife I'm calculating here as I talk

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:04.000
and you can well you can't see it in this morning light my poor skin is taking a hit from all this

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:10.800
outdoorsness I should use sunscreen it's probably I'm outdoors about eight hours a day. Awesome

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:17.920
and is that an increase from 15 20 years ago? Yeah but that's a simple structural change I

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:24.720
started writing outdoors rather than indoors and so that's five hours a day. Yeah awesome

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:34.160
Stan this has been great thank you so much for your mental neuronal connections that end up creating

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:40.560
new mental imagery and connections in other humans it's an art and a skill and a gift

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:47.520
and I hope I hope you have a great next novel in mind and we'll have another conversation.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.280
Well thank you Nate it's been a pleasure and I might not have another novel for a long time

01:22:53.280 --> 01:23:01.120
but it's okay I am I'm doing other things I've had an awfully long writing career and so if I get

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.840
a few years off to kind of reorganize my poor brain that's probably a good thing too so

01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:08.960
I'll be having fun yeah thanks Stan
