0	6720	Unfortunately, the dynamic of positive feedback and super linear skating leads to the speeding
6720	12320	up with the pace of life. So you have to do things faster and faster, and that eventually
12320	18560	leads to a socioeconomic heart attack. And that's the issue. And so how do you get around that?
20880	27920	I am pleased and honored to welcome my next guest, the physicist Jeffrey West to the program.
28720	35840	Jeffrey was a professor at Stanford. He was the leader and founder of a high-energy physics
35840	42400	group at Los Alamos. And most recently, he was the president of the Santa Fe Institute. He has been
42400	51200	long fascinated with general scaling phenomenon in biology and nature. Today, we talk, among other
51200	59200	things, about Kleiber's law, which states that the metabolism or the energy use of an organism
60000	67200	scales to the three-quarter power of its size. And we apply that not only to human bodies,
68000	76080	but to human exosomatic energy, how much we use in cities and the whole world with fascinating
76560	84000	ominous implications. For those of you that have long followed this podcast, this conversation
84000	92960	is a must-watch and also enjoyable. Jeffrey is kind of like a wise kind of physicist version of
92960	100720	Gandolf. And I learned a lot. I think this is at the core of what people need to understand
101360	107760	about the linkage between human nurture and human nature as biological organisms,
107760	113280	how we use energy and materials. Hope you enjoy it. Please welcome Jeffrey West.
124320	126560	Jeffrey West, welcome to the program.
127520	131280	Nate, thank you so much for having me. I'm delighted to be on your podcast.
132400	138640	You are an important human to have on this podcast because the great simplification at its core
139280	149680	is about the metabolism of cities, economies, our culture. And you are probably the most world-renowned
149760	157120	scientist on the concept of metabolism and scale. So I really wanted to get you on,
157120	162800	and I'm glad we finally connected. Yes. As I said, I'm delighted to be on,
162800	168400	and I'm sorry we couldn't do it sooner. So I, of course, have like 20 questions
169200	176240	just for starters. But if you could, in your lifetime of work at the Santa Fe Institute
176240	184640	and elsewhere, you have a very wide biology systems approach to the world. If we could start
184640	192400	with just a flash round of explaining some key concepts in not too lengthy answers,
192400	198720	just as a foundation that apply to the theme of this podcast. So let's start with the basics.
198800	206560	What is Kleiber's law? So Kleiber's law is, first of all, is named after a man named Max Kleiber,
206560	217200	who was a biologist, what is now UC Davis in California. And he discovered, I guess is the
217200	228160	right word, a remarkable systematic law in biology for what is presumably the most fundamental
228160	234880	quantity of interest, not just for an organism, but almost for any system. That is, how much
234880	241760	energy does it need to sustain itself and indeed to do the activities to function.
243120	249760	And that's called, of course, in biology, that's called metabolic rate. Roughly speaking,
249760	257520	it's equivalent to how much food you need each day to stay alive. And what Kleiber did was he
257520	265120	both gathered past evidence and did some measurements himself of metabolic rate
265120	276400	for a whole spectrum of animals, mostly sort of from mice to elephants. And what he discovered
276400	284000	was that there was a very systematic and mathematically extremely simple scaling law
284000	290800	for how that quantity scaled from the, well, in this case, the smallest mammal to the largest
290800	296560	mammal that he could measure at the time, although he did also have some measurements
296560	301760	someone else had taken on whales, blue whales. But what he discovered that was so important
301760	308800	was the following. So first of all, you have to recognize to plot a mouse and an elephant on the
308800	320240	same graph is a challenge of itself because an elephant is maybe 100,000 times heavier than a mouse.
320240	329920	And so instead of plotting it 1234 in terms of grams, the natural way to plot it is by factors of 10.
330720	339200	One, 10, 100,000, etc. In which case on ordinary sheet of paper, you can get both a mouse and
339200	344320	an elephant. And when he did that, and that's called plotting it logarithmically, when he did that,
345680	352560	he found something extraordinary. The points lie almost precisely on a straight line,
353200	361840	which is kind of amazing because each one of these organisms has evolved by natural selection.
361840	368160	So by which we mean that it's gone through this sort of, roughly speaking, arbitrary and chaotic
368160	375360	process in competition with every other organism in the biosphere, so to speak. And so it's
375360	381360	historically contingent. That's how we think of organisms as historically contingent,
382000	386400	meaning that if you plotted it the way I just described, you would expect, okay,
386400	391040	there might be some correlations, but they would sort of be spread all over the graph,
391760	399600	each point reflecting, so to speak, the historical trajectory of the organism. Quite the contrary,
399600	406240	they all line up beautifully on a straight line. And what in addition that he discovered was that
406240	413760	the slope of that line was very close to the number three quarters, 0.75. And that became known
413760	422240	as Kleiber's law for metabolic rates. So if it was so robust across all these organisms
422240	429520	of historical contingency, the implication is it functions akin to a natural law,
429520	434160	something going on on our planet and with species alive here.
434240	441440	Yeah, so one of the things that you've implied by that is that what Kleiber did was, of course,
441440	448400	for some subset of organisms, almost entirely mammals, but later he and others expanded it
448400	456160	across the entire sort of spectrum of organisms from cells all the way up to ecosystems. And
456160	463440	they discovered this law is indeed incredibly robust. It applies to any taxonomic group of
463520	472320	organisms, whether fish, birds, mammals, cells and so forth. And so therefore, it's sort of natural
472320	478960	to conclude that this is in that sense, a law of nature. It may not be a law of nature, sort of
478960	484960	like Newton's laws with governing motions and so on, in the sense that they're precise. Because if
484960	490080	you look at the graph, each point lies just, you know, slightly off from that straight line a little
490080	497360	bit. But in that statistical sense, it's an extraordinarily robust law that metabolic rate
497360	504000	scales the language of it as the three quarters power of mass across the biosphere.
504560	511840	So as you survey an animal and their size gets bigger, the amount of energy they need to sustain
511840	519440	themselves per day scales according to their mass, but not one for one, but to the three quarters power.
519520	526560	Indeed. And what is the scientific speculation on why it's three quarters power?
526560	532880	Yeah. So first of all, let me just say a word about that three quarters. That three quarters
532880	539120	obviously less than one. So we call that sublinear. And three quarters less than one means that,
539840	543760	you know, if it were one, the slope of one, that would be linear, which means if you
543760	550000	double the size, you would double the number. So you would double, you'd need twice as much food.
550000	556640	So this law has this extraordinary consequence that every time you double, you actually save 25%.
557680	563680	So there's this systematic economy of scale that goes from the smallest to the largest.
564400	570160	And that has profound consequences for the whole structure of the biosphere,
570160	574640	including the sustainability of the biosphere, which maybe we can come to later.
574640	581360	But going to your question, namely, you know, what is the origin of it? That's what got me into the
581360	588000	game because I learned about this scaling law many years ago. And for various reasons started
588000	596240	getting very intrigued by it, especially because it's so antithetical to one's sort of naive idea
596240	602160	of what evolution by natural selection is going to produce, all this sort of randomness and
602160	607760	sort of arbitrariness. And quite the contrary, as I said earlier, this is very highly systematic
607760	613440	and predictable. And that got me involved in trying to understand it, especially because
613440	620960	I learned that there wasn't any generic sort of universal explanation. And I got involved in it.
620960	628880	And I came up with this idea, the following, that if you ask what is common to not just birds,
630160	637440	birds, fish, mammals, and so forth, but also plants, plants also satisfy the same law,
637440	642320	which are quite different. What is similar about, well, the thing that's similar is that
642320	649200	they have this huge challenge of having a huge number of component cells. We have about 100
649200	658880	trillion inside us, and they have to be sustained, fed in a sort of roughly speaking egalitarian and
658880	665040	efficient way. And the way we've done it, we, meaning natural selection, have done it, is evolve
665040	672640	these networks that serve as cells, either like a circulatory system, respiratory systems, and so
672640	681680	on. And the idea was that I worked on was the idea was that this is universal, and that it is the
681680	691120	mathematics and physics of these distribution networks of energy, resources, oxygen to the cells
691120	698880	that is constraining metabolic rate to have this simple scaling law. And if I could understand it
698960	705360	and do the mathematics properly, I would be able to derive the number three quarters
705360	714720	from the properties of the networks. So between a mouse and an elephant is a human. So the human
714720	723760	would be our internal body with 100 trillion cells would lie in that logarithmic chart between a mouse
723760	731040	and an elephant. But what about outside of the body, our transportation networks in our cities,
731040	740720	in our global economy? How does that apply? Because that isn't an animal. That is a social
740720	749520	and economic structure built by animals. So, yes, so let me just give us a little, a few words
749520	758240	about the background to this. So this theory was developed based on networks, just thinking about
758240	766480	organisms to begin with. It was actually extended to forests, which is a community of organisms.
768720	774320	And does it apply to forests as well? Yes, it applies to forests. That's what's amazing, actually.
774320	780560	It applies to trees, plants. And when you put those all together to form a community,
782000	790080	it applies to them. So it was very natural when we extended it to all these things we found,
791040	795360	you know, it was sort of almost a complete theory of the scaling of almost any
796320	804400	physiological attribute or trait of an organism, and to any of its life history events, like, you
804400	810480	know, how long you live, how long you take to mature and so on. But then when all that work was done,
811520	817520	brewing in the background was your question. Human beings are special. We've done something
817520	824560	extraordinary, including what we're doing here. We've created this incredible technology. We,
824640	832080	once we discovered language, which this technology doesn't seem to the viewers, but we are using
832080	836400	quite a bit of energy right now with the light and the internet connection and the
836400	842160	embedded energy and all the microphones and everything. Absolutely. And so it was natural
842160	849440	to ask the question, you know, what about the what, you know, the socioeconomic activity
849440	856160	that we have created, which for one of a better word, I like to now use anthroposphere,
856160	862240	or sometimes I like the word a bannosphere, because one of the things that has become very
862240	869040	apparent in this last century is the planet is dominated by cities, which is our very
869040	877360	manifestation of our evolution from hunter-gatherers to becoming sedentary communities, and then
877360	884320	forming these massive cities and all the fantastic things and also the bad things that come along with
884320	890800	urban living. So going to your very question about how does that change metabolic rate?
891440	895200	And this is a fundamental question. First of all, you have to ask the question
896080	904640	about just organisms in their natural state. In their natural state, what I talked about,
904640	910560	metabolic rate scaling with the three quarters power, you have to ask yourself, first of all,
910560	916000	what is the what is our metabolic rate? How big is it? First of all, what we call our basal
916000	921600	metabolic rate, which is simply the amount of energy you use. So sitting around doing nothing,
922320	931200	doing that number is 100 watts. That is two, but most people don't realize that's 2000 food calories
931200	939360	a day, which is how much food you need to eat to stay alive, is only 100 watts. You only operate
939360	945440	the energy of a light bulb, which is truly extraordinary. Now, if you add in your hunting
945440	951120	and gathering, so to speak, I mean, before we became this marvelous socioeconomic entity,
952000	957120	it goes up by a factor of two or three. And that's true across all mammals. That's true of a mouse,
957120	962480	it's true of an elephant. If you include their actual activity, it's two or three hundred, two
962480	969280	to three times bigger. So our sort of natural active metabolic rate, and there's still people on the
969280	978480	planet that live this way, is somewhere between 200 and 300 watts. So anyway, so now you ask about us
978960	988240	participating as we are here, as you said, using energy to fuel this communication system, to have
988240	993200	the energy that was used to make the laptop that sits in front of me, to have this office,
993200	999200	this nice office I'm in, to produce all those books behind me, to have an automobile out in
999200	1005280	the parking lot that I'm going to go home, I have a home, I have all this stuff that's part of me.
1006240	1013040	We think of it as, it's actually me and it's you. It's your exosomatic metabolism. Exactly,
1013040	1020400	exactly. And if you add all that up and you ask how big is it, it's not a hundred watts,
1020400	1025520	it's not even two or three hundred watts. If you're an American, it's about 11,000 watts.
1026480	1035200	Our social metabolic rate is about a hundred times what our natural basal metabolic rate is.
1035200	1041200	So on on Kleiber scale, 11,000 watts would scale to what size of an animal?
1042400	1050480	It's about 30, what is it? It's equivalent to about a dozen elephants. That's the number I
1050480	1056720	usually keep in mind. It's about the blue whale is the biggest mammal, the biggest organism that's
1056720	1064000	ever existed. It's not quite a blue whale. We're maybe a half to three quarters somewhere in there,
1064000	1069440	the size of a blue whale. So each of us on the planet roughly, or each of us certainly in the
1069440	1076800	United States and developed countries are acting as if we were the size of almost a blue whale.
1077600	1080960	Or 10 to 12 elephants. Certainly about a dozen elephants.
1082640	1086880	So that's the U.S., which is about four or five times the global average, right?
1086880	1094720	No, it's not even four or five times. It's more like about two to three, actually,
1094720	1098960	believe it or not. It's kind of amazing, actually. It's not as big as people think.
1099920	1103600	And it depends a little bit, you know, I mean, getting measurements of social
1103600	1110160	metabolic rate is actually quite a challenge to know exactly what you put in there and what you
1110160	1114720	don't. You do include the military, you know, questions like that. Exactly. So there's all
1114720	1120880	kinds of question mark, but nevertheless, you know, there and this is work, you know, that now
1122080	1128720	I'm beginning to push very hard on that we need seriously to come to terms with what we mean by
1128720	1134400	that and what that number is and get it for different countries, different cultures and so
1134400	1142240	forth. Let me ask you this. So you've been a lifetime scientist and systems analyst. At some
1142240	1148720	point in the last 20 or 30 years, you were working at a computer or a notebook and you
1148720	1156640	discovered that the metabolism of the average American was a dozen elephants. Did you at that
1156640	1162720	moment like, was that like disgusting and profound? Like, oh my God, like, was that a shock to you?
1164720	1169360	Yes, I think it was at the time because I really was, you know, this was near the beginning of the
1169360	1175520	work and I hadn't sort of put it all together and I hadn't seen its extent. And most importantly, I
1175520	1185440	hadn't seen its consequences. And this was one way that sort of made me sit up when I realized,
1185440	1192400	when I turned the equation around, that is, given if I take seriously that metabolic rate
1193840	1201120	of 11,000 and ask that question, how big an animal are we actually equivalent to? And seeing
1201120	1208080	how big it is, that already blew my mind. And then beginning to realize that, well, at that time,
1208080	1214720	there were, you know, 7.2 billion people on the planet. And each one of us in our own way wants to be
1215600	1222560	having a social metabolic rate of over 10,000 watts. And that is extraordinary. And that brought
1222560	1229200	to home to me the challenge that we have in sustaining, you know, what is brought to us
1229200	1237200	so far to this stage. So not only are we functioning metabolically as a dozen elephants,
1237200	1242960	but that is our global cultural goal is to get to that point or beyond that point.
1243040	1250240	Yeah, no, I think that's right. I think that's, you know, and, of course, it's even more so,
1250240	1258800	it's, you know, those of us, the leading edge of this, namely in Western Europe and the United
1258800	1264960	States are pushing to get more, actually. I mean, that's what the economy, you know, that's the
1264960	1270560	paradigm that we're in. You know, it's been most successful, it's been an extraordinarily successful
1270560	1277760	paradigm, you know, the discovery and exploitation of fossil fuels coupled with the discovery and
1277760	1284080	exploitation of capitalism and entrepreneurship and, you know, the extraordinary creation of wealth.
1284080	1293280	It's been phenomenal. I understand the natural law aspect of Kleiber's law as it pertains to mice
1293280	1301840	and individual humans and elephants and forests and the like. But if a human system like a city
1301840	1311680	or an economy, the social metabolism got bigger, does Kleiber's law automatically apply to that?
1311680	1317760	Or is there, on the social metabolism, is there less of a natural law and more of maybe a nature
1317760	1326000	versus nurture wide boundary of possibilities? Yeah, this is a really important question and
1326000	1333520	not one that's easy to answer. First of all, what you call Kleiber's law strictly only applies to
1333520	1340320	organisms. That's this three quarters. When you look at analogs to social metabolic rate,
1340400	1349440	they could be proxies like, you know, GDP, GDP of a city could be GDP of the planet, but GDP of a
1349440	1359040	city or, you know, the wages in a city or the number of patents it produces in a city, how
1359040	1366160	much innovation is produced, all these are sort of proxies for or results of social metabolism.
1367120	1375040	What we discovered was that instead of the three quarters, we see a number like 1.15,
1376080	1383760	and which is instead of being less than one, which meant sublinear was the word I use, which meant
1383760	1391280	the bigger you are, the less you need per capita, in that case, per cell for an organism.
1392000	1397840	When you come to a city, you're exactly the opposite. The bigger you are, the more you need
1397840	1403680	per capita, in that case, per human being. There's a metabolic positive feedback. Exactly.
1404960	1410960	As a positive feedback, and that positive feedback can be traced back to the positive feedback
1412000	1419920	for the dynamic and the process of what cities were evolved to be, namely to facilitate and
1420000	1426320	encourage social interaction. And so that positive feedback is a result of the positive feedback
1426320	1433040	in social interaction that comes from me talking to you until you talk about this thing that we
1433040	1438160	build on each other. So it's creating new nodes and each node requires more energy.
1438160	1444720	It creates new nodes and it creates new ideas. We're continually creating ideas and creating
1444720	1450560	wealth. And that, as I say, has been enormously successful, and that leads to this super linear
1450560	1458080	scaling. And what about villages or people living in the countryside? Are those smaller
1458080	1465520	entities with 10 houses or 100 houses different than a big city like Santa Fe or New York?
1466160	1471920	Well, Santa Fe is a small city. It's bigger than a few houses. It's bigger than a small village,
1471920	1479920	that's for sure. Well, the thing is that what is amazing is that the data shows that this dynamic
1480640	1488000	systematically increases with size of the city. Because it increases the chance of more interactions
1488560	1495360	and great cities encourage more interaction. I mean, New York is maybe the prime example of a
1495360	1502560	place where the buzz of the city is visceral and really encourages, not only that, it encourages
1503760	1511120	not just interactions, but it encourages potential and possibility. And that tends to be absent
1511120	1516720	as you go down in size. This may have to be a three-part podcast because now you're getting
1516720	1523200	into some deep areas that I've speculated a long time. Let me first ask you,
1523520	1530240	do you have an opinion on what Howard Odom called the fourth law of thermodynamics, which is the
1530240	1537040	maximum power principle? Which maybe that's related to Kleiber's law, that organisms and ecosystems
1537600	1544320	self-organize to take advantage or to degrade an energy gradient. Do you believe that?
1544320	1549760	Well, in some form of it, I do believe. Yes. And in fact, all the work that I do
1550400	1556400	is based on something that's slightly more general than that, in fact. And that is, all of these
1556400	1563120	systems evolve towards optimizing something. We're called it something. So for example,
1563120	1570960	just to give you, just to go back to take it out of the socioeconomic characteristics to talk about
1570960	1578960	organisms again. So the way the derivation and calculation of Kleiber's law follows
1578960	1587680	from the network theory is that all mammals that have ever existed share the same kind of
1588640	1596000	cardiovascular system that has evolved to minimize the amount of work your heart has to do
1596560	1602640	in order to pump blood through the system to supply energy to the cells, energy and oxygen
1602640	1611360	to the cells to sustain life. And the idea is that you minimize that in order to gain a
1612160	1620320	fitness advantage by being able to devote more energy in the case of organisms to sex and
1620320	1626960	reproduction and the rearing of offspring, which is Darwinian fitness to project into the future
1626960	1636320	your genes. And so there's a kind of, so you optimize the structure of the network in order to
1636880	1645360	minimize the amount of energy. And so this is one of a number of these kinds of optimization
1645360	1653920	principles of which Odoms is another one. And cities, you could argue, have evolved to do two
1653920	1662960	things because they are much more sophisticated in some ways than an organism because they have
1662960	1668720	two pieces. They have infrastructure, which is the analog to your circulatory and respiratory
1668720	1674560	system and all the rest. But they also have something that we've just touched on, and that is
1674560	1680640	social networks, that feedback, positive feedback. And the city is sort of the integration and
1680640	1685760	tension between those two. And so in the social, in that, well, let's talk the infrastructure
1685760	1693120	network, you might hypothesize that the thing that's being optimized is, or as cities evolve,
1693120	1700960	was that the transport system, whatever it was, even if it's just walking, was such that the
1700960	1707040	structure of the city evolves so that you minimize the time in order to get from A to B, wherever
1707040	1712560	A and B are, you minimize the time and the distance. And that's what you try to do when you,
1713120	1717360	you know, when you go home, you don't take some arbitrary route, you try to, you know, a route
1717360	1726240	that is optimal in terms of your time and distance and so forth. The social network, on the other hand,
1727600	1734880	might optimize in order to simply to create interaction, the way the system is to facilitate
1734880	1741920	more and more interactions, so that more ideas can come to the surface, more wealth can be produced,
1741920	1748320	and so on. So here's why I brought up maximum power principle. Yeah, so it's very similar to that.
1748960	1757760	So if we had a city of a thousand elephants, that city would largely have the same metabolism
1757760	1765680	of the individual elephants times a thousand. Exactly. But if we have humans, there are social
1765680	1775040	status pressures, there's moving upward in the social hierarchy, there's novelty, there's discovery,
1775040	1783440	there's incentive, and so I would argue that that dopamine, in a way, is part of the origin
1783440	1789760	when humans are living in proximity like that in large numbers, that might explain some of your
1789760	1799200	1.15 positive extra linear dynamic, which is almost a brain equivalent of the maximum power
1799200	1805760	principle. There's something that we're trying to optimize that's outside our basal metabolism.
1805760	1811360	It's something social, which is why there's a positive feedback there. Yeah, absolutely. No,
1811440	1815760	it's exactly right. And by the way, just going back to the biological for a moment,
1817360	1824400	I said you only require about 100 watts, 2000 food calories a day. But if you took all your cells,
1824400	1829920	all that 10 to the 12th, 100 trillion of them, and just put them aside and asked,
1830480	1835360	how much energy does all those cells, if they were not interacting and be part of you,
1835920	1843200	just laid them out on a table, if you could imagine it, you would require 50 times as much food.
1844800	1852560	So you have an extraordinary economy of scale in bringing all this together in all of us,
1852560	1858960	in your whole body, interacting in a highly coherent, integrated way. And so it is with the
1858960	1869280	city. And I'll give you an example. I think what is in New York is about
1872720	1882320	100 times bigger than Santa Fe in population, turns out, roughly. And New York produces,
1883360	1887680	so you might have a naively guess, New York will produce 100 times more patents.
1888400	1896240	It doesn't. It produces 200 times as many than Santa Fe. And you could ask, how many patents,
1896240	1903440	if we took all of the individuals in Santa Fe or New York, and you made them into some guru that
1903440	1908880	sits on the top of a mountain and contemplates the mysteries of the universe, how many patents
1908880	1914000	would that produce if you took all 15 million New Yorkers and put them on the top of the mountain
1914560	1918320	and so on. You know how many patents they produce? Zero.
1919920	1923280	Well, because they no longer care about social status, they want to reflect.
1924240	1930800	Exactly. So that's all part of what a city is. But without passing judgment, good or bad on it,
1930800	1932000	that's who we are.
1933840	1940800	Okay. So if you don't mind, I'm going to read out loud to you one of my favorite quotes that
1940800	1946800	was in my academic paper on the superorganism, and I'd like your opinion on it because I have
1949040	1953760	a deep philosophical question for you, and you're one of the first people that I've had live to
1953760	1958720	be able to answer it. So this is a quote from a book called A Short History of Progress by
1958720	1965280	Ronald Wright. What took place in the early 1500s was truly exceptional, something that had never
1965280	1972160	happened before and never will again. Two cultural experiments running in isolation for 15,000 years
1972160	1978240	or more at last came face to face. Amazingly, after all that time, each could recognize the
1978240	1987120	other's institution. When Cortez landed in Mexico, he found roads, canals, cities, palaces, schools,
1987120	1992800	law courts, markets, irrigation works, kings, priests, temples, peasants, artisans, armies,
1992800	1999920	astronomers, merchants, sports, theater, art, music, and books. High civilization, differing
1999920	2006160	in detail, but alike in essentials, had evolved independently on both sides of the earth. So
2006160	2017280	my question to you is, when humans encountered energy surplus, which was the unspent metabolism
2017280	2023040	outside the bodies in the form of agricultural surplus and eventually fossil hydrocarbons,
2023840	2033360	was this kind of inevitable, this scaling of cities like almost a cancer that is unfolding?
2034160	2039680	What are your thoughts? How can you explain that quote that I just said from your biological
2039760	2049920	systems background? Well, I guess I would have to say, to some degree, it was inevitable.
2050880	2057840	Namely, you might have even extended that because it was true of China. I mean,
2058720	2066160	when Marco Polo went to China, he discovered that he immediately recognized city, right? I mean,
2066160	2070320	and in fact, they'd existed way before the cities of Europe that he'd come from.
2071040	2077520	So, you know, we have, you know, there's only those three examples, and I'm a physicist,
2077520	2084000	a scientist, and one has to be careful about extrapolating from special cases or specifics.
2084000	2094320	Nevertheless, the theory that I have expounded of the origin of scaling, namely that it has its
2094320	2101680	origins in the networks that support these systems. On the one hand, let's just stay with
2101680	2106800	cities now for the moment. On the one hand, their infrastructural networks, the roads,
2107840	2114880	general transport lines, the supply lines, I mean, in modern cities, that would be electricity,
2114880	2120080	gas, water, and so on. But those are networks, and those are much like biological networks.
2120160	2123760	And on the other hand, the social networks that we just discussed,
2123760	2130480	the interaction between human beings, which is universal. I mean, we may look different,
2130480	2134480	and we have different cultures and different histories and geographies, but roughly speaking,
2135200	2140080	at the level of which we're having this conversation, human beings are pretty much
2140080	2148240	identical across the globe. Were you social? Absolutely. So that's who we are. It's in our
2148240	2155520	DNA, because we evolved from being bands of hunter-gatherers, forming sedentary communities,
2155520	2160960	discovering language and agriculture, and so forth, and leading eventually to
2162400	2171200	cities and megalopolises that we have now. So here's the thing, the evidence in favor of believing
2171280	2178720	that it was potentially inevitable. We discovered all these scaling laws for cities,
2178720	2184480	namely that and our stages with the superlinear for the moment. If you look at all socioeconomic
2184480	2192320	activities, whether the kinds of things I mentioned earlier, wages, number of patents produced,
2193120	2199440	amount of crime, amount of disease, et cetera, anything that involved the interaction of human
2199440	2206160	beings with each other, and you plot them versus city size, you see these beautiful scaling laws,
2207280	2213760	namely on a logarithmic plot, straight lines, and the slope is superlinear. It's about 1.15,
2213760	2219120	and it's the same for all these different metrics, but what is amazing and relevant to the question
2219120	2225200	you brought up, it's the same pretty much across the globe. That is, the scaling of cities within
2225200	2234000	the United States is the same as it is in Argentina, as it is in Spain, as it is in Portugal,
2234000	2245760	wherever. Therefore, it's as if, it's as if in, I don't know, 1800. People realize, my God, the
2245760	2251120	industrial revolution has come, this extraordinary expansion is going to be happening, we're building
2251120	2256400	cities like crazy, we need an international convention to bring together as to how we're
2256400	2261760	going to design cities, and these are the scaling laws that you have to obey, and go out there and
2261760	2266400	build your cities, but these are, well, of course none of that happened. It never happened. It never
2266400	2273040	happened, it happened totally organically, the Japanese cities which had nothing to do with
2273040	2281360	cities in Portugal, I presume, or very little, and cities in the United Kingdom all scaled in a
2281360	2290000	similar way, indicating that there was this organic dynamic that is already somehow in a DNA
2290000	2296720	which is being expressed in the organization and dynamic of city.
2297440	2305840	I sometimes in my public presentation show a graph of CO2 in the atmosphere from Montaloa
2307360	2314480	overlaid with all of the convening of parties, Kyoto Protocol, all the different meetings,
2314480	2321760	and you might say, oh, the CO2 is because of those meetings, but the CO2 increase is an
2321760	2327440	externality of the scaling that you're describing. Yes, absolutely. Oh, absolutely. In fact, I often
2327440	2338800	show a graph of the scaling of carbon emissions versus city size. So I really, I'm so honored to
2338800	2346320	have you because I really care about this, not only in what do we do about it, how can we steer
2346320	2352160	humanity to a better place, but it's just so fascinating. It's like a forensic detective
2352160	2365040	story, so it's cool despite the horror of the implications. So in theory, though, yes, humans
2365040	2374800	are you social, we have nature and nurture. Our bodies have this metabolic need, but our 10,000
2374800	2384640	watts outside of our 100 watt body, that is a social phenomenon. So is there a way that
2384640	2394000	governance or degrowth or something could come up with social structures that have a sublinear
2394720	2401360	metabolic scaling instead of a 1.15? Maybe we could reduce that in the future hypothetically.
2401360	2408320	What are your thoughts on that? Well, that's a tough question, one I quite a bit of thought to
2408320	2415600	without great success, to be honest. That is the implications of these scaling laws
2416960	2421920	for future growth and the future of the planet don't look good. I mean, in fact,
2422800	2428560	if you just take them to the logical conclusion, it's very hard to see how we can sustain things
2428560	2437520	as they are. So if we just simply continue in the same mode, I think we're due for some
2437520	2445760	major collapse at some stage. I hate to be so pessimistic, but it's hard to see how it can
2445760	2453840	sustain itself. It's sort of Malthusian in a way, but it's much more goes way beyond Malthus because
2454560	2461200	that statement includes the effects of innovation. I mean, the work that we've done,
2461200	2468160	you can put in an innovation plays a crucial role in it, in fact, but all it does in quotes all is,
2468160	2477520	yes, it postpones the problem till later, but unfortunately, the dynamic of positive feedback
2477520	2482720	and super linear scaling leads to the speeding up of the pace of life. So you have to do things
2482720	2488960	faster and faster, and that eventually leads to a socioeconomic heart attack, and that's the issue.
2490400	2494640	And so how do you get around that? Well, you have to change something fundamental,
2495440	2501920	and that's something to do with, if you believe any of this, it's to do with social networks and
2501920	2507760	social interaction, which means that it has to be almost revolutionary in the way we interact with
2507840	2516160	each other and form communities. And ultimately, that's not a scientific question, it's a political
2516160	2520800	question, it's a sociopolitical question. Or a spiritual question. Or a spiritual question,
2520800	2526000	yes, absolutely. Because if you took those, I don't know what the number you said, if you took
2526000	2531040	the 15 million people in New York that were developing patents and put them in the wilderness
2531040	2535920	somewhere, they would develop zero patents. But then when they came back to New York,
2535920	2541200	maybe they would have a change in consciousness, and there would also be less patents and less
2542400	2547600	social striving for competition, because maybe the definition of their self
2548720	2552880	expanded to include the biosphere and the future and other creatures.
2552880	2564640	Yeah, I think that's right. Because mostly, the baggage we have, that is us, is mostly material.
2564640	2569040	I mean, that's the way we think, you know, we identify ourselves with our jobs and our houses
2569040	2575280	and so on. And at best, in terms of human interaction, we identify with our loved ones and
2575280	2583360	people very close to us. But we don't identify very much with nature being part of us, even though
2583360	2590320	we're so obviously kind of came from the natural world, we are part of the natural world, but also
2590960	2597760	that we're all part of each other. I mean, it's, I know this sounds a bit flaky, but it's sort of
2598320	2605760	love thy neighbor as thyself kind of thing. And, you know, we are yearning in order to solve this
2605760	2619440	problem for, you know, some spark, some leadership that inspires us to rethink who we are and move
2619440	2625280	in a direction towards it. I mean, it's the image, I hate to say it, I'm not a religious person,
2625280	2631840	I'm not a Christian. But to have a Jesus Christ or a Mahatma Gandhi or a Martin Luther King,
2631840	2640480	someone that inspires the good in people and the collective. And somehow we've lost that.
2641280	2644560	That's where my thinking has been going of late.
2644560	2651600	It's so weird. I mean, I'm, you know, I'm sufficiently old that I grew up in the city,
2651600	2657840	you know, my very formative years as an adult, with the 60s and 70s, and all the, you know,
2657840	2663680	flower children and love and all that, which is, you know, but I realized in my old age,
2663680	2670160	my science is sort of taking me back to realize that has sort of misguided as much of that was
2670720	2677600	the, you know, that, that sense of love and that sense of being part of the collective
2677600	2684480	and that it isn't just material well-being that is going to make you happy, that you need
2685360	2691840	also both, for one of a better word, spiritual, whatever that may mean to the individual,
2691840	2696880	but you need to be filled part of both the natural and social world.
2696880	2703680	I agree with that. And that's really the foundation and the ethos of, of this channel.
2704480	2714800	And, you know, here's a profound question in the same way that an addict can't solve his or her
2714800	2724320	addiction until he or she has awareness. Can we change our metabolism as a culture without,
2724320	2730560	without realizing that we have a metabolism? I think we have to recognize these metabolic
2730560	2737440	scaling laws that you've been working on because if we take that into account, it suggests some of
2737440	2743280	our, you know, strategies that we're striving for are kind of dead ends and it might suggest other
2743280	2748720	ones. What are your thoughts on that? Yes, but I don't know, I don't know what those are. I mean,
2748800	2756000	as I say, I just, you know, I mean, I must say, just going back before that,
2758080	2763840	it's very hard not to be very pessimistic until you move into this, until you take it out of the
2764560	2774000	context of materialism and the idea that paradigm shifts and innovation means technology.
2774000	2784000	It needs to also have that idea of a paradigm shift or a rebirthing needs to be something
2784000	2793280	that is socioeconomic. And how you do that, I don't know, because I did, I guess my present
2793280	2799920	thinking, and I basically said it a moment ago, is that I would love to think that it could be
2800640	2808000	bottom up, but I have a, my experience says that it needs to have some top down meaning
2808000	2814080	leadership. I mean, I mean, enforced on you, but, but you need, I mean, that's why Donald Trump
2814080	2822000	really intrigues me in this sense that Trump was, is extraordinary in terms of his charisma
2822000	2829040	and his being able to tap into what I consider the negative parts of this, the parts that encourage
2829920	2835840	you to feel very individualistic, not to feel you're part of the collective, not to care about
2835840	2841280	nature and so on. You know, it's all part of us. I mean, we have all these things, each one of us
2841280	2849440	contains all this stuff inside us. And he, in some extraordinary way, somehow, what's the
2849520	2860000	Waltonshowong, he had this moment that he tapped into this part of our nature,
2860000	2867440	which I think goes against all of this and only encourages us to go further and further and deeper
2867440	2875040	and deeper in towards the collapse of modern society. And we need, so to speak, an anti-Trump.
2875120	2882080	You know, someone with Trump's charisma and ability to sense, forget about, you know,
2882080	2887520	whether he's articulate and intelligent, but he has an extraordinary genius for sensing something.
2888320	2893120	I agree with you, but let me ask you a scientific follow-up question to that.
2893120	2896320	Yeah, so this is not, by the way, that was not science, what I said.
2896320	2897440	Oh, but I know.
2897440	2901600	This was my personal, emotive opinion.
2901680	2908640	But scientifically is the anti-Trump, someone that would exhort and inspire the opposite
2909440	2918160	attributes, would that individual counter the go against the grain of this metabolic
2918800	2923600	dynamic that you're talking about, this positive energy scaling that we've seen
2923600	2925120	in human history and around the world?
2925680	2932960	That's the big question. That is the big question because, you know, the, you know,
2932960	2941040	another way, a very crude way of saying, well, the origin of this continuous open-ended growth
2941040	2949440	and super linear scaling is that the principle that, you know, in our socioeconomic activity,
2950160	2956960	the optimization is that each individual wants more, you know, greed, greed being sort of the
2956960	2964640	fundamental driving force. And is that part of our DNA? Is that what's been actually happening?
2965600	2970400	Because by the way, greed is not necessarily always negative. I'm not even being
2971040	2977680	necessarily pejorative about it because that greed is also to do better, to run faster, to
2977680	2985920	whatever. So I used it in a very general, not necessarily pejorative sense.
2986640	2991280	So it's using that energy, turning that energy into positive energy.
2992560	3000400	A lot of this has to do with metabolic scaling laws on energy use. And the other point that we
3000400	3007440	haven't made yet is when energy scales, even if we had the ability to scale our continued
3007520	3013200	energy, the environmental impact and the materials and minerals and all the other stuff scales as
3013200	3022240	well. But I think on the energy sense, for 95% plus of our history, we didn't have any external
3022240	3028720	metabolism because we were hunter-gatherers in Tanzania. And so I almost think that our fall
3028720	3035440	from grace was when we started to store energy surplus. And until energy surplus goes down
3035440	3042480	and stabilizes, we're going to have these issues. Yes, no, that's of course true. I agree with you.
3044160	3049200	So, but that also leads to something we haven't discussed and something I'm not an expert on
3049200	3056160	at all. And that is a source of energy and the idea that, of course, from a physical
3056160	3062720	viewpoint, there's enough energy to continue this or add infinite of almost the energy of the sun
3063520	3072880	is clear. We use a very small amount and our problems began. Well, they did begin, of course,
3072880	3079040	as you say, when we created surplus energy, especially from agriculture and so forth. But
3080000	3087760	they got amplified enormously in the industrial revolution where we found it very easy not to
3087760	3092960	use the energy that we are having, getting from the sun, but to use the energy that we got from
3092960	3099040	the sun and stored on the surface of the earth. And so we just just, you know, what we've done
3099040	3104720	since about 1800 is simply burnt the surface of the earth. I mean, that's what it is. We're just
3104720	3111680	burning the surface of the earth as we speak. And which by the way, you don't have to be a physicist
3111680	3117280	to know that if you're burning the surface of a sphere, it's going to get hot and the flows
3117280	3122080	of currents of air and things are going to change. So it's sort of a no brainer that you're going to
3122080	3129680	change the climate and the system is going to get warmer. So that's one of its consequences.
3129680	3137600	But what we need to do is to change from what is effectively a closed system, namely just the
3137600	3144240	energy that's already here, to return ourselves once we came to where we have an open system.
3144320	3149360	We're just using the energy of the sun, which leads us of course to this whole question about
3149360	3155680	the economics of renewables and the technology associated with it and so on. But in principle,
3155680	3161120	as I understand it from my colleagues who are experts in this, you know, if there were a serious
3161920	3169440	global program, we could turn this over and change everything in a relatively short time.
3170000	3174400	But you'd have to have dedicate, you know, you'd have to give up so much to do that.
3175760	3185360	It's not feasible. I want to focus on your core expertise, but briefly, I don't think it's possible
3186240	3193040	because we would have to continually regenerate those constantly. But let's just assume that
3193040	3199040	you're right that it is possible to get rid of fossil carbon and to replace it with renewables.
3199520	3204640	Let's assume for the moment that that's right. Don't we still run into the metabolic scaling
3204640	3210720	of the 1.15 if we have the same governance and cultural aspirations? Absolutely. Absolutely.
3210720	3216720	No, absolutely. And I'm very glad you brought that back because that's part of my whole sort of
3216720	3225760	bully pulpit is exactly that is that just solving, just in quotes, solving the energy problem
3226480	3234400	or global warming or whatever you want to call it is not enough because you're going to put yourself
3234400	3243280	back potentially in that situation again. It goes a hell of a long way if you could, if it's correct
3243280	3252320	that we can release ourselves from the dependence on fossil fuel would go a hell of a long way.
3252320	3258720	But you still have to deal with the social problem or the sociopolitical problem
3258720	3263920	that is sort of underlying this that's coming from this dynamic in social networks.
3263920	3268960	I want to move to some deeper, more forward-looking questions, but I have a couple more
3269760	3275680	like factual ones related to cities. So you said that cities and you explained why
3276640	3287280	scale super linearly at 1.15, not 0.75. What about the global economy? Is it a collection
3287280	3294320	of cities from a math standpoint or how does that map? Yes. So this is work that still has
3294320	3302240	to be done and it's work in progress and it's something. So there's two to come from both
3302320	3310400	directions. One is that you, you know, you can say, look, the city, the city, the globe
3310400	3317120	is dominated by cities. You know, in 20 or 30 years, it'll be 70 or 80% urbanized.
3317120	3322000	Certainly by the end of the century, it'll be, you know, 80% urbanized, which is what
3322720	3328400	most developed countries or all developed countries are over 80% urbanized. So to all
3328400	3335840	intensive purposes, you can, certainly thinking longer term, you can think of the city as the
3335840	3343120	globe, as of some of all the cities. Okay. And that's one way of setting up, setting it up,
3343120	3348560	so to speak, mathematically and conceptually. But you could also sort of shortcut that,
3348560	3358080	meanwhile, by asking, just finding out how much energy is being used globally, how much water,
3358080	3366160	et cetera, et cetera. And then you can think of the globe, the planet, as a single entity.
3366880	3371920	Okay. Not the sum. It is the sum of everything, but it's also in the same way that you can think of
3371920	3379280	you as this, as yourself or the sum of all yourselves. And you have to do both, of course.
3380160	3383680	This is our first conversation. So you probably don't know a lot about my work,
3383680	3390720	but I wrote a paper called Beyond the Superorganism. And I believe that global human society,
3390720	3397520	not the hunter-gatherer cultures, but the mass of most of the developed world and those following,
3397520	3401920	function metabolically like an energy-hungry, mindless superorganism.
3402640	3409440	Yes, I'm afraid that's true. I had to put the emphasis on mindless, unfortunately.
3409760	3418880	Mindless in the same way that you said this was inevitable and that we build cities and
3418880	3426560	Marco Polo and Cortez in that sense. We're not, let's plan this. Let's build this out. No, it's
3426560	3434240	like those subterranean ant colonies. There's no architectural plan for those. It's a by-product
3434240	3440080	of them seeking out energy in the most efficient way for their colony. Exactly. That's the idea.
3440080	3451360	Exactly. Okay. So you have proven that cities are centralized units of society that use resources
3451360	3460480	more efficiently. And what about as people start to understand biophysical, ecological limits,
3460480	3467440	and there's many people now advocating for more decentralized models. We need to spread out and
3467440	3475760	decentralize and not have the central markets and globally interconnected things. How does that fit
3475760	3483040	in with your scaling models? If instead of having 100 huge cities in the world, we have 10,000
3483600	3490000	small cities, does that mean we're less efficient and actually have more environmental
3490000	3494240	ecological impact? Or what are your thoughts on that? Yeah, so that's a very tough question.
3494240	3500480	The work has not been done, by the way. And I've not given it much thought till recently and I've
3500480	3507760	not worked on it seriously. And I've only started thinking about it because of this idea of the
3507760	3514480	so-called 15-minute city, which is, do you know what I'm talking about? No. So it's been proposed,
3514480	3521760	in fact, one of my collaborators, a very interesting man, and Carlo Racci, an architect at MIT,
3522720	3531520	is one of the major proponents of this. And that is we need to sort of retrofit cities
3532080	3539280	so that you can do everything within 15 minutes of where you live. That's it. So it's localizing
3540720	3548240	this big agglomeration, you know, rather than this sort of old image, which is partially true. That
3548240	3553760	is, there's a central downtown and then there's all these layers going out to the suburbs outside
3553760	3560320	of kind of almost concentric, almost onion-like. Instead of that, you have lots of these centers,
3560320	3565600	which had been talked about before anyway, but now it's people are taking it quite seriously
3565600	3572960	and putting numbers to it, like making it sort of this 15-minute idea. Anyway, so that got me
3572960	3581840	thinking about that. And indeed, you know, naively, and I've not done the work, it does what you said.
3581840	3588640	It would mean that it's less efficient for the collective. You know, that is in the same way
3588960	3596000	as I said, if you, oh, here's another, here's an example that is like the one I said earlier. If you
3596000	3604080	took an elephant and you asked the equivalent biomass in mice, so it's the same number of cells,
3604720	3612000	except in one, on one side you make all those cells an elephant, on the other you make it into,
3612000	3618560	and I forget the number, you know, 200 mice are equivalent. And you ask, how much energy do they
3618560	3625120	need? An elephant, the 200 mice, if that number is right, I don't remember the number, but that
3625120	3634400	number of mice requires, I think it's 20 times as much food as that single elephant. So there's
3635120	3640880	extraordinary price to pay, you know, you've got to produce so 20 times as much food,
3641520	3646960	and you're going to produce 20 times as much entropy, therefore 20 times as much pollution,
3646960	3655200	and waste, and so forth. So applying that example to humans, a bunch of small cities
3655200	3662000	with the same population and same resource throughput would be an environmentally deteriorating
3662000	3667120	factor. Yes, they would produce much more. So if you did the same, if you took New York
3667120	3674960	and you made it into its hundred centipedes, naively, you would, you know, you would produce
3676720	3682400	much more pollution, you would require much more energy, and you would produce less ideas.
3682960	3688160	So did you know... That would be the idea. Did you know E.L. Wilson, he passed away?
3688640	3696640	I did know. He's someone I always wanted to meet. One of his ideas endures, and I have all of his
3696640	3705040	books, I only have one of yours, is the idea of half Earth, where humans have half the Earth and
3705040	3710960	all the other nature in wildlife has the rest. I'm just wondering if we just have one giant city,
3711600	3716080	I mean, how would that work? I mean, I don't think that works either. So the other end of the
3716080	3722080	spectrum doesn't work either. Okay. Because one of the things you discover, which we only touched
3722080	3730640	on earlier, is if you start putting, because you need a system, then it turns out you actually need
3730640	3735600	and you optimize the entire system. And I talked about it in terms of the forest. I said, you know,
3735600	3740800	we did work on individual trees, and then we put the trees together for the forest. It turns out
3740800	3750320	you need a distribution of sizes and in order to optimize the system. And that's roughly what we
3750320	3757280	see. It turns out that is what has evolved. So would you call that a power law? Yeah, that's
3757280	3764400	also a power law. That also works as a power law. So I often hear about power law in public
3764400	3772560	conversations that 80% of the points in the National Basketball League are scored by 20%
3772560	3780720	of the players. Is this really a robust finding? It's a robust, but it works very, very roughly.
3781760	3786560	You know, rule of thumb, the 80-20 rule, as it's called, sort of works.
3787280	3798880	I don't know how close it is, but 80% of the GDP is produced by 20% of the cities or 20%
3798880	3804960	of the people or whatever it is. That's roughly correct. I mean, certainly what is the spirit
3804960	3810800	of it is certainly correct. Well, the spirit of it is what I'm curious about. How can you explain,
3811520	3818400	as a physicist, as a scientist, why that happens? Why does that 80-20 rule roughly hold?
3818960	3827520	Well, that again is the work to show that the optimum structure for optimal use of resources
3827520	3833920	and energy, if that's how the system, as the system has evolved and new things grow, new towns,
3833920	3840160	new cities, and the thing is continually adapting and evolving and minor changes.
3840720	3850160	That arranges itself following a distribution that is a power law. And, you know, just for the
3850160	3855920	distribution of cities, that's called Zip's Law, after a man named Zip, who discovered it in the
3856880	3867760	in the 1930s, like Kleiber discovered his law. And most entities do that. You know, the distributions
3867760	3875600	follow, roughly speaking, that rule. And that rule has that power law as its consequence,
3875600	3883680	this kind of 80-20 number, roughly. So let me ask you a difficult or at least uncomfortable
3883680	3890480	question. Again, one of these that I've saved for you specifically. If you took a time lapse,
3892640	3898560	aerial view of our planet over the last 50 years, 30 years, 100 years,
3901520	3908800	it looks a lot like a cancer growth. So there are 200 types of cancer. Do you assimilate the
3908880	3915280	growing form of some cities, metabolisms, and what's happening in the world to different types of
3915280	3924160	cancers using common descriptors like aggressiveness or speed growth or metastatic, or where does
3924160	3932720	this analogy hold? And where does it break down? Yeah, I don't know the answer to that. And I
3932720	3937600	occasionally think about it. And it may be that I don't think about it very much because
3938480	3946640	some years ago, or I don't know, probably 15 years ago or more, I was interviewed by the
3946640	3955920	economist about some of this work. And it was about the growth of cities and the growth of
3956800	3960800	what are called informal communities and the old language slums, basically.
3960800	3971760	And the word cancer came up in that context. And I meant it very much in terms of
3974480	3984160	the idea that you have an organism, which is sort of in a metastable situation.
3984720	3991840	And then at some stage, you know, something starts growing inside it, which maybe shouldn't be there
3991840	3998000	or should be there, whatever, but it starts growing. And in that sense, that's how I thought of
3998720	4005360	a slum or an informal community. That's something that's slightly outside, outside of
4006080	4015200	what was the host system. And this thing is growing in a way that is sort of in some way or another
4015200	4022640	violating the rules. And I referred to that as cancer without, and I got into trouble.
4023920	4027600	Because along with the word cancer, obviously, can note something.
4029840	4034240	Cancer is a physical scientific description, but it's also kind of like a verb.
4034720	4040320	Yeah, it is. No, and it carries an enormous weight. So I've been very reluctant to...
4040320	4048560	But it's a little bit... I hear you, and it just looks like visually similar.
4048560	4054640	And in fact, I suppose, I thought the question I thought you were going to ask, and maybe it was
4054720	4065120	implied by it, you know, if you were some alien, whatever, taking photographs of this planet
4065920	4078960	over the last 100,000 years, it would be for the first 95,000, maybe 98,000,
4079520	4083840	it would not much would change. I mean, there'd be seasonal changes, of course.
4083840	4090640	But the overall structure wouldn't change drastically, and it would look so. And then,
4092240	4097520	beginning that last couple of thousand years, it would have gone bonkers. It would have been all
4097520	4107040	this stuff started growing on it and taking over. And then the last 30 years, it doubled again.
4107440	4113920	Absolutely. Just going completely crazy. And you might think of that as a cancer from the outside.
4113920	4122400	That is... Oh, I mean, that's not casting aspersions on anybody except us, us as human beings.
4122400	4126800	I know. Cancer cells don't like to label themselves as cancer because it's...
4126800	4130080	No, I'm sure they don't. I mean, I'm sure they're doing what they think is...
4130080	4132640	They are doing what's best for them. And by the way,
4133520	4138640	cancers, literally, cancers are us. They're our DNA. They are us.
4139600	4144320	So is cancer in a human body an example of a super-linear scaling?
4144880	4151280	No, but cancer, no, it doesn't, actually. What is interesting about cancers is they
4151600	4163040	are left to their own devices, so to speak. That is, if the body went on living forever
4163040	4167280	and the cancer just kept growing, it would do what the body did. It would grow and then eventually
4167280	4174960	stop growing. And some cancers do that. They grow quickly and then they stop. There are some.
4174960	4182320	But usually what happens before then, of course, they metastasize that is they start
4183120	4187360	doing bad things elsewhere and then shutting down organs and sort of the
4187360	4193600	terrible things that lead to mortality. So let me shift this to forward-looking.
4194160	4201280	Given what you've laid out here on the metabolism and energy use of organisms
4201280	4208000	and outside of the body exosomatically, how would a physicist listening to this program
4208800	4215760	who understands metabolism of cities and the inevitable end of linear scaling because we are
4215760	4222720	on a finite system, the linear scaling of cities, advise government planners on planning?
4223680	4231200	Well, let's make it first of all local. And I've interacted with many cities.
4233840	4243200	This work, I would be very reluctant to be prescriptive to actually say,
4244160	4256960	you know, I'm not a McKinsey. But the thing I tell cities is that you should be cognizant
4256960	4263760	of these scaling laws because unbeknownst to you and all your predecessors that have been
4264720	4272880	city planners and builders and so on and extending cities and so forth,
4274320	4284240	there was this dynamic that is going on in a kind of hidden way. And if you build a city in
4284240	4291760	violation of the scaling laws, you're going to run into trouble. And indeed, the history of
4292720	4297840	building major cities, as well as minor ones, but big cities, which, you know, like
4297840	4307040	Brazil and Islamabad and Canberra, even Washington DC, building cities, de novo, planning cities.
4308160	4311360	I don't think there's a single one that has been successful.
4313360	4319680	You know, I mean, they've always been highly criticized. They don't work. They tend to be
4319680	4327680	soulless. People are very unhappy, dissatisfied. Now, eventually, those organic forces of nature
4327680	4335520	take over. And eventually, Washington DC turns from being a boring city that most people don't
4335520	4342640	want to go to and live in, to a city that has only happened in the last maybe 20 years or 30 years,
4342640	4348720	become a city that's like every other big city of that size, exciting, interesting,
4348720	4355280	lots of young people, ideas floating around and so forth. But it took, you know, 100 years to do
4355280	4363360	that, whatever it was. Brazilia is just beginning to turn that corner. It was built in the 1960s
4364720	4375920	and is at last beginning to somehow evolve into a real city. So, and the point is what happens is,
4375920	4381600	of course, people determine the structure of a city. So, people don't, you know, you know what
4381600	4386640	it's like, I always give this example, because I hang around universities, typically, you know,
4386640	4393360	they build some new quadrangle or whatever in a city, and they have the various buildings around it,
4393360	4399840	and then they put in paths going across it to go from A to B. And of course, then they open it all
4399840	4406160	up, and the students and faculty start using it. And some of those paths they use, but many of those
4406160	4410560	paths they don't, and they start walking across the grass in a certain direction, and they form
4410560	4416080	their own. Well, that's the sort of thing that happens in a city. Gradually, the city organically
4416080	4423760	adjusts to optimize whatever it is, the function of that. In that case, this university is four.
4424720	4431680	So, that's what happens to these cities. The city evolves and changes so as to optimize what it's
4431680	4440080	there for, and it becomes a real place. So, my advice is follow the, be cognizant when you do it,
4440080	4446880	of those scaling laws, because most of the things that are done in the building of new towns and
4446880	4453520	cities is really sort of almost rules of thumb. So, if you followed the scaling laws, you would make
4453600	4458880	some decisions that would prevent disasters 10 or 20 years from now because of the scaling laws.
4458880	4465760	That's right. They're there to prevent disasters and mitigate or at least minimize. I wouldn't
4465760	4471440	say even prevent. I wouldn't be as arrogant as to say that. Minimize. I would say minimize disasters
4472080	4477600	that are going to occur because of some, you know, we decide, oh yeah, we should put a park here,
4477600	4481600	we should build this building here, and it should be this time, we should do this and that.
4481600	4487040	So, on a national level, the horses already left the barn. I'm afraid so.
4487040	4490640	Yeah, but on a local level, we can maybe take this wisdom.
4490640	4497360	Absolutely. Or if you are building a new city, which doesn't happen very often,
4497360	4503120	any longer in the United States, but is happening elsewhere, please for goodness sake,
4504000	4511040	be cognizant of that. And not just of the scaling laws themselves, but of the underlying dynamic
4511600	4518640	that is encapsulated in those scaling laws and to do with social interactions and also to think
4518640	4528560	about how those fold into the functionality of what you want that city to be. It's so interesting.
4530000	4536160	I'm taking up a lot of your time, but I want to get to some of the key questions that I had
4536160	4546640	planned to ask you in no particular order. Do the energy use curves of dying societies resemble
4546640	4552560	those of biological creatures dying of old age? Oh boy, I don't know the answer to that. I don't
4552560	4561280	know. That would be a very interesting question to do some work on actually. I suspect it's extremely
4561280	4569760	hard to get data. One of the things that is very hard in this, which surprised me in this work on
4569760	4577760	cities especially, is difficulty in getting data. The data is out there, but it's all modern data.
4577760	4588880	You'd also like to get data from 1920, 1820, 1620. Historical data geographically spread around
4589520	4595200	so that you can start to address these very questions. Now, some of my younger colleagues
4596400	4602720	looked into this in terms of pre-Columbian cities in Mexico, for example, where there's
4602720	4609360	archaeological, a lot of huge amount of archaeological data, and using that data to show that urban
4609360	4616480	systems, ancient urban systems, actually followed these scaling laws. That was very encouraging,
4616480	4623040	actually. But the question you're asking would be very hard to eke out data. We're very interesting
4623040	4630880	to think what you could use for proxies for the decaying city and what are you going to measure
4631520	4637120	that would tell you about it. I mean, there is data, and people have started to look at it,
4637120	4642160	and I haven't followed it very carefully that came out of our work, looking at ancient Rome,
4643040	4649600	because there you have the build-up and then the sustenance of a powerful, all-powerful
4650240	4658400	city empire, and then its decay into the first part of the millennium.
4659200	4665920	So, in your opinion, are we running our governments more like cities or more like companies?
4665920	4668960	And what does this mean for the livelihood of our nations?
4669600	4673600	That's a question, believe it or not, where we're sort of doing ongoing research.
4674800	4680880	So, let me just tell you, I can't answer that question directly. It's probably more like cities,
4680880	4686960	actually, but we did ask the question, we asked two questions that have been worked on.
4686960	4691840	One is, first of all, about universities, people we've asked about. So, there was, you know,
4691840	4697040	are they more like cities or companies kind of question? I won't go into that, but the question
4697040	4703040	maybe more direct relevance came out of a conversation which I'm sure you've had informally
4703040	4710800	with some friend or colleague where you sit around and you bitch about administration and bureaucracy
4710800	4717040	and how it's getting in the way and it's destroying everything. You know, for us, you know, why is the
4717040	4720960	National Science Foundation so full of idiots that don't understand?
4720960	4724400	What is the role of that bureaucracy with metabolism?
4724400	4731840	Doing, you know, what is all that? So, we, myself and a colleague started talking about this,
4732480	4737520	you know, bitching, and then it sort of hit me, actually, that, you know, I said, you know,
4737520	4746880	is it conceivable that actually these bureaucracies are actually quite efficient and optimized
4746880	4752800	for the collective but are very bad for the individual? That is, at the individual level
4752800	4757840	dealing with it, it just always seems to get in the way, there's too much of it and so on. But
4757840	4764320	actually, if you looked at the whole system and the function of whatever that agency is or that
4764320	4774000	company or that whatever, actually, it's tending towards optimization. So, it's got a very long
4774000	4781520	story short. We, after several attempts at writing little white papers that got summarily rejected
4781520	4787600	by funding agencies, eventually it was picked up and given very large funding by the National
4787600	4794560	Science Foundation. So, we have this big grant to do that and we have a, we have some extremely
4794560	4798720	good people, people that work with us and we have someone at Harvard Business School,
4798720	4806160	someone in the Sloan School at MIT and so forth. So, what are you mostly doing with your time now?
4806160	4812240	What questions are like keeping you up at night that are you're fascinated by and want to pursue?
4812880	4820880	Well, lots of them, too many questions, but the two major things, and by the way, at the same time,
4820880	4829120	unfortunately, because I'm into, well into my 80s, dealing with health issues myself, my wife,
4829200	4837040	inevitably. So, I don't, and I obviously don't have quite the same energy to stay up to two or
4837040	4841600	three in the morning doing the calculations. You seem like you have a hell of a lot of energy.
4843040	4850160	I'm doing sort of okay, but nevertheless, so with that caveat, the two things that I'm most
4850160	4856640	interested in, of the many that I'm working on with colleagues, one that's been a theme throughout
4856640	4863680	all of this work, and I've never really completed it, and that is, I have this sort of long-term,
4863680	4875040	morbid interest in aging and mortality, death, and understanding what that process is, and in
4875040	4882960	particular, to understand why it is that human beings live of the order of a hundred years,
4883040	4887040	where does the hundred years come from? And that, in a sense, that's why I've got me into all this
4887040	4894720	work, that, you know, just a side personal comment, that I come from a family of short-lived males,
4895600	4901680	you know, but my, they all die in their 50s and 60s. Occasionally, someone manages to reach 70,
4901680	4908000	but so, I assumed I would be dead in my mid-60s, and I started to worry about this question,
4908960	4912720	which got me interested in the many of these questions that we're now talking about,
4913520	4920480	and I've somehow violated the genetic rule of my family, because I'm now 83 and I'm still going,
4921040	4925760	so that's interesting of itself, you know, what is going on here with that, so that interests me very
4925760	4935760	much, and I'm, but the other question, which I suppose is related to it in a way, is the whole
4935840	4942400	question that we've touched on is the sustainability, and therefore the mortality of the anthroposphere,
4942400	4950160	of this fantastic socioeconomic system that we have developed, so, you know, I'm one of these
4950160	4957360	people that don't fear the fact that human beings will somehow go extinct, I don't think that's
4957360	4965120	going to happen, and I sort of don't care, what I care about is that we're socioeconomic human
4965120	4970240	beings will go extinct, I don't want to lose all this, it's fantastic what we've created,
4970880	4978240	even though it has built into it, in a certain sense, its own demise, can we save it and keep
4978240	4983760	it going, and try to understand that, so we discussed this earlier in the conversation,
4983760	4993120	but really trying to develop a science of the anthroposphere, considering it as an integrated
4993120	5001280	whole, that is the planet is an integrated whole of socioeconomic activity, and I more recently
5001840	5007520	got much more serious about it, because one of the things I didn't say earlier was that,
5008560	5015520	unbeknownst to me, a few years ago, a man whom I did know, named Will Steffen, an Australian,
5015520	5023600	I think he was an anthropologist by training, but Will was, I think, the first person to put
5023600	5032800	together data of material and socioeconomic metrics for the planet as a whole, and he published this
5032800	5039360	stuff, and all of them looked like hockey sticks, of course, you know, they're zooming up, and the
5039360	5046080	data he collected goes back to somewhere in the fifties, and he turned all this the great
5046080	5055120	acceleration, okay, so he left it at that, and it became central piece for scientists working on
5055120	5061440	their anthroposphere, now I only came across this by word of mouth a couple of years ago,
5062000	5068240	and I was very excited when I learned that this data existed, because then I could go back to
5068240	5075040	what I had been thinking about much earlier, several years ago, but I'd stopped thinking about it, or
5075040	5081600	so I put it aside, because there wasn't data, and I come from a tradition of physics, that is,
5082480	5091120	we do theory, we make models, we make, we create ideas and concepts, very important to make
5091120	5096320	predictions, to understand what's been done, and make predictions that we can test, and so forth,
5096960	5103120	but this was devoid of data, so I was sort of left hanging, and I thought sometime in the future
5103120	5109600	there will be, now it has happened, it's very crude, but enough, and the good news for me,
5109600	5117200	as a scientist, is I wrote down some equations, which I won't go into, I wrote, and for the
5117200	5123120	anthroposphere, and it made some predictions, they're really post-dictions, because they're for
5123120	5129360	socioeconomic activity, and the data, it agrees beautifully with the data, and so that has given
5129360	5135840	me hope, that we can continue this, and really, you know, this is very much scratching the surface
5135840	5142160	of work in progress, that we can really make a, you know, a serious theory, or put it slightly
5142160	5151120	differently, a conceptual, quantitative, analytic, mathematical framework, that we can start, start
5151120	5157920	thinking seriously, in terms of something I termed in my book, sort of grand unified theory of
5157920	5164800	sustainability, because we do need to bring everybody into this conversation, and I want to
5164800	5169920	create a framework where everybody can sort of get involved in it, and we can really come to terms
5169920	5176560	with all these wonderful questions you brought up in the last hour or so. What keeps me up at night
5176560	5184000	is very simple, is how do we save the biosphere and the 10 million other species we share the
5184000	5194000	planet with, but how do we reduce our environmental impact without the violence and collapse that
5194000	5200320	would require us to tighten our belt, and how to how to marry those two things. On your first question
5200320	5206720	though, Jeffrey, and you know, we could come back and do a second podcast on this, but
5206720	5214160	just out of curiosity, do you personally use intermittent fasting? And a more important question
5214160	5222560	is, how would fasting and reducing the caloric input as an individual organism affect, like
5222560	5229040	consciously having a trump card on your natural impulses at the level of the individual, how would
5229040	5236240	that affect your metabolic scaling and age and all the other things? Do you have an opinion on that?
5236240	5241520	It would not affect the metabolic scaling per se, but it would lead to longer life.
5242480	5247440	Really? You're confident of that? I'm very confident that if you were to reduce,
5247440	5255840	if you could reduce your metabolism, you will extend your life. Now, how much is obviously
5255840	5261680	individualistic, and for some people it may not work very much. So do you reduce your
5262240	5268800	caloric intake? I don't, actually. Well, I don't eat very much. I'm old. I don't eat very much.
5274320	5283360	So I went through a long period where I did, and I lost 30 pounds. I was 180 and I went down
5283360	5288800	to 150 without even realizing it. Yeah, it was terrible. And I freaked out when the doctor,
5288800	5293680	you know, I went for some, you know, this got sort of nothing to with anything, but I went for my
5293680	5299920	annual exam and I was standing there and naked, and the doctor looked at me and said, Jeffrey,
5299920	5307120	come into the next room. I want you to look in the mirror. And I looked and it was quite sobering,
5307120	5315520	I have to tell you. And I did think, gee whiz, I better do something. But I'm now, but I did
5315520	5322720	reduce it to what I was naturally, you know, more naturally earlier. I now stay around 165 to 70.
5323280	5329600	So in that sense, the answer is yes. But I don't, I'm not, you know, I'm not obsessive about it.
5329600	5335920	And it's not sort of part of my consciousness. I agree with that. And it seems logical and
5335920	5341040	scientifically grounded. The question is, is how do we apply that from the level of the individual
5341040	5346240	to the level of society? I think that's extraordinarily difficult because of the, again,
5346240	5351920	the commercial pressures on food and especially fast food and so on. I mean, that's another one
5351920	5358960	of these things where, you know, sometimes in my darkest moments, I think, yeah, there's a lot to
5358960	5366720	be said for benevolent dictatorship, you know. Yeah. But I'm such a committed Democrat. And
5366720	5371200	now you're Democrat, it's ridiculous. Yeah, those two words are, you know what I mean?
5371200	5376000	It's don't fit in the same sentence. So I've taken up a lot of your time. I have a few questions
5376000	5381440	that I ask all my guests. And this has been great. I love your work. And I've learned some new
5381440	5387200	things in this conversation. So you've thought about and worked as a macro observer at the Santa
5387440	5394080	Fe Institute for a long career on these issues. Do you have any personal advice to the viewers of
5394080	5400800	this program for their own lives, given the global upheaval and the anthroposphere and the
5400800	5406720	metacrisis and everything else? Do you have any personal advice given your lifetime of experience
5406720	5412960	and wisdom? Well, I'm very reluctant to give advice, I have to tell you. Just my... You're a scientist.
5412960	5418320	Yeah, exactly. So my science gets in the way in a certain sense. On the other hand,
5418320	5427200	I'm a human being and you know... Exactly. So, you know, I guess it's sort of
5427200	5433520	hops on what we talked about earlier. And I try to do it myself and I don't succeed.
5434080	5441040	And that is just be much more cognizant of the fact that I'm really part of the community.
5441760	5448400	And therefore, the community is part of me. You know, I'm carrying that around with me. And the
5448400	5456160	community is everything from my community of colleagues here at the Institute to the community
5456160	5463840	I'm part of in terms of a city, Santa Fe. Part of a community I am as part of being an American,
5463840	5469040	living in America. I'm part of being a human being that we're all interrelated, interconnected.
5469600	5475920	And, you know, it sounds again a bit hokey. You know, it doesn't matter what side I'm on,
5475920	5482960	but you know, people dying in Ukraine or Gaza or wherever, Syria, that hurts.
5484080	5491280	Because the thing that I began to realize in addition to what we've already said is that,
5491280	5496960	as far as I can tell, we are the only part of the universe that actually cares.
5499200	5504880	It's kind of sobering. I mean, I love nature and I can say all those things about nature
5504880	5511680	that I said about my fellow human beings and community, that I'm also that advice that to
5511680	5517360	recognize that you are part of nature and nature is part of you. That's where we came from.
5518080	5525600	And, you know, we're in it together kind of thing. But there is, you know, but the fact is
5526160	5534880	that nature doesn't care. You know, it does not care. We invented, as far as I can tell,
5534880	5540880	ethics and morality. We've done terrible things and we're doing terrible things,
5540880	5548000	but we also do wonderful things and we need to be conscious that we are the only ones.
5548000	5554400	And that is an incredible burden and incredible responsibility and we should all be aware of it.
5554400	5561760	So it's me being, we used the word spiritual earlier. I'm not a religious person. I'm not
5561760	5569440	a believer, but that's my version of belief. I think it's beautiful. We don't have the right
5569440	5577840	to assume that this story is inevitable and we are the only species able to care.
5577920	5583200	That's well said. We're the agency of care. You know, I mean,
5584560	5590480	and that is a hell of a responsibility. We're also, by the way, the agency of understanding.
5592640	5596480	And we're also the agency of metabolic impact.
5598800	5605040	All wrapped into one. And all of that stuff. The thing I loved about my own work, I have to tell
5605600	5613280	you, is the recognition that all these things which are considered disparate and interconnected
5613280	5618640	sort of don't have much to do with one another. And I've kind of, you know, put into boxes.
5618640	5625440	Actually, it turns out they're all interconnected and they all do the same thing. I mean, in very
5625440	5633200	generic terms. But they're all manifestations of the same theme. They're all variations on
5633200	5638400	the same theme. But that is extraordinary. For the record, I also love that about your work.
5639520	5645360	So you have been around universities and young people for a long time. How would you change
5645360	5652480	your advice? What advice would you give to an 18, 22-year-old human who is starting to understand
5652720	5656400	the broader biophysical backdrop of their time?
5659120	5669440	Well, do science. I believe in science, strongly. Be a humanist. Read the great books.
5673040	5681600	And recognize that the two most important things in the universe for human beings
5681600	5687440	are love and understanding. And if you could, I mean, I say those. It's not that I've heard
5687440	5694080	here to those. I've tried, but I've failed, of course. But I try to keep those as part of my life.
5694800	5700960	I can see those right beneath the surface of your science and scaling. I can see those.
5700960	5707040	This has been an amazing conversation. And I've never met you before this phone call. So
5707920	5712320	hopefully we can stay in touch. And I'd love to help you with your work.
5712320	5720240	If you were to come back in six months for a follow-up, what is one topic that we would
5720240	5725520	just focus on that topic that you're extremely passionate about that you think is relevant
5725520	5730480	to human futures as esoteric as it might be? Do you have anything like that?
5730880	5736480	Well, I would, I mean, we've already discussed a lot of it. But I think because that's what I'm
5736480	5744560	thinking about so much recently is it would be this long-term future of the planet, global
5744560	5749040	sustainability. Are you writing a new book on that? Are you actively researching that?
5749760	5755200	I'm actively researching it. It's the question about writing another book. You know, when I
5755200	5762560	wrote my book, one book, I mean, I've edited all kinds of things, books and so forth. But to write
5762560	5774400	solo this book, I put called Scale, which I was a, you know, I'm not a natural writer in the sense
5774400	5780480	that I labor overwriting. I'm happy with the book, but I do labor over it. You know, every
5780560	5786400	sentence is like, you know, pulling teeth, feeling, which is crazy. You know, I'm warranted,
5786400	5790000	but I do it. Well, on the next one, just get a ghostwriter. Get all your ideas out and get a
5790000	5798480	ghostwriter. That book, by the way, the book Scale, I was strongly urged by some very, very
5798480	5803680	influential people extreme that I, because I was sitting on my butt, not doing anything,
5804560	5811680	that get a ghostwriter. I had some extremely good people willing to write it. And that actually
5811680	5816640	got to me in the end, because I said in the end, you know, I can't do that. I'm too much of a control
5816640	5823600	freak. Yeah, these are my words. Exactly. So, but, and I have even thought about it for, I know,
5823600	5828480	so I said, after that, I'll never write another book again. I sort of put everything into that.
5828480	5836320	There's no way. But two things changed that might make me change my mind. One is,
5837040	5845280	I realized that I sh that book in a way could have been three books or four books, actually,
5845280	5855360	because it's and one of the things I tried to do in that book was explain everything, meaning
5856080	5860880	I didn't want to pull things out of the hat. I didn't want it sort of gee whiz and so on.
5861680	5869120	And the good thing about that now is that if I write another book, I can point to the old book
5869120	5874000	and say, look, it's already there. Yeah, it's already there. Go read those pages. You're fine.
5874000	5880720	You know, well, I'm just going to tell you this. I encourage you to write another book or some
5880800	5887920	version of it because I think at the core of your work is the fundamental question that humanity
5887920	5896400	faces, which is can knowledge and understanding of metabolism impact our metabolism?
5896400	5903520	Yes, that's a very interesting way of stating it. Yes, that's exactly right. That's exactly
5903520	5908080	courted. But by the way, I've got one other thing I wanted to say about why I would write it. And
5908080	5918080	this shows a slightly negative side of my personality. And that is, you know, I know many
5918080	5922800	of the science writers that have been very successful and I shot name names. But one of the
5922800	5930880	things I began to realize is that they were sort of writing the same book again, and they get more
5930880	5937040	for it and so on. And I was sort of getting frustrated. Why did they do that? You know,
5937040	5943120	it was and I thought, shit, maybe that's what I should I should actually rewrite some of this
5943120	5949040	and so on and cash it. And then the other thing was I've worked and it came yesterday. Here's my friend
5951520	5957360	Venky Ramakrishnan, who is a well known, he just this book just came out. Why we die. Oh, wow.
5958160	5966480	And Venky is a wonderful man. He's a Nobel Prize winner. And he's a Cambridge University in England,
5966480	5970240	lovely man. And he's talked to me a lot about this. And I'm glad to see him,
5970960	5974560	even though I've not written much about it, he referenced me. But I saw that book and it was
5974560	5979680	again one of these things which happens. I think, bloody hell, I should have written my book on
5979680	5984960	aging and death, even though there's, you know, there's a whole chapter to it. But people don't
5984960	5991920	notice that. So it's part of this ego. There's this kind of ego driven thing. Narcissism,
5991920	5997360	there's ego, but there's also emergence. Because since you wrote read, wrote your book,
5997360	6001760	you're learning about interconnected things that you have deeper insights now.
6001760	6005840	No, and I should, and that's what I've tried to convince myself. I should take
6006640	6012560	those pieces and use those as points of departure. Yeah, expanding further. Yeah.
6012560	6015680	So maybe I'll do that. I don't know. I'm getting, you know, it's, I don't,
6015680	6018640	not sure I have the discipline any longer to do it.
6019440	6023760	I'm sure you're going to do something interesting and productive. Thank you for your lifetime of
6023760	6027120	work and thanks for your time today. And let's please stay in touch, Jeffrey.
