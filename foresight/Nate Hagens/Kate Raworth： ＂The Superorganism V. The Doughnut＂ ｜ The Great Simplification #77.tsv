0	5320	Welcome to another episode of The Great Simplification. Today, I'm very pleased
5320	12800	to welcome my friend and self-described renegade economist Kate Rayworth. Kate
12800	18760	is known for her book, Donate Economics, Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century
18760	25200	Economist, and the related lab that she co-founded, Donate Economics Action Lab,
25240	29720	which is putting into practice the planetary boundaries and human
29720	35520	sufficiency in the doughnut around the world. She's also a senior associate at
35520	40440	Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, as well as a professor of
40440	46920	practice at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. She's an incredible
46920	51720	communicator, and I think her work on doughnut economics is painting a picture
51760	55880	that people can understand, that we are part of a broader system that we're
55880	62160	influencing, and the current economic rules and institutions are not
62160	68080	only creating environmental overshoot, but they're really not doing a great
68080	73560	job for the humans. This was an incredible conversation. I hope to have Kate
73560	79600	back on various reality roundtables. She's doing very important work. Please
79680	81200	welcome Kate Rayworth.
92880	94000	Kate, great to see you.
94120	95200	It's great to be here.
96120	96960	How are you?
97040	97400	I'm well.
97400	98600	You are very busy, I imagine.
99040	104320	Yeah, I think everyone's busy, right? We can all make busy, but I'm well, and
104880	106840	I'm really looking forward to this conversation, obviously.
107760	111920	Thank you for all the important work you're doing. Your book, Doughnut
111920	116600	Economics, and your ongoing work with Doughnut Economic Action Lab are
117240	123720	influencing and inspiring a lot of people, so thank you. Let me ask you a
123720	130520	question. Many of us that worked in finance and economics had kind of a
130520	136760	aha moment where we left the dark side. For me, it was 20 years ago on
136760	141360	Wall Street reading Herman Daley's book, but you're a classically trained
141360	147400	economist, now an ecological economist. What were some of your aha moments
147400	152720	that caused you to pause and like, wait a minute, do you have any acute
152760	153960	stories or memories?
154280	159160	So I studied economics at university in the 1990s. I had the, what's the
159200	162920	opposite of an aha moment? It's like, oh, no, moment, that kind of, oh, no,
162920	166400	moment when, you know, I've come to study economics because I care about the
166400	169800	environment. There's no paper on the environment at all. There was nothing.
170240	173640	It was like one week in public economics, you know, a company paused
173640	178520	chemical gloop in the river, that kind of, that was it. When we talked about
178520	182920	inequality, it always would begin with taking initial income distribution as
182920	187600	given. Would this Pareto change, improve things? And I was like, why, why
187600	191640	do we take income, things as given? Why don't we start with asserting human
191640	195480	rights? So I had quite a lot of, oh, no, this isn't turning out to be the tool
195480	199240	kit. I was really hoping it would be, which is why when I left university, I
199360	202800	didn't want to call myself an economist. I actually walked away from it for
202800	207040	many, many decades. But then make, like many other people, I had those aha
207040	211840	moments that started bringing me back. So one of the first ones was seeing the
211840	215840	planetary boundaries diagram. I have it actually right here. It's, it was seeing
215840	219480	it into my brain. I came back from maternity leave. And somebody showed me
219480	224880	this. And it was a massive, oh, that's the beginning of 21st century
224880	229080	economics. Because like you, I had just read Herman Daley's book, Beyond
229080	235840	Growth. That made my brain flip. And when I saw this picture in 2010, I was
235840	239640	thinking, well, the, the, Joanne Rockstone, Will Steffen and the planetary
239640	244040	boundary scientists, they have quantified that biosphere around the economy
244040	248200	that Herman Daley drew. He conceptualized it. They quantified it. And we are
248200	252560	game. We are on. Here we go. And that's why I drew a circle within a circle and
252560	255920	created the donor. That was a massive aha moment for me. Somebody else then
255920	258920	mentioned a couple of years later, well, of course, the work of Danela Meadows
258920	262120	thinking in systems, I'm like, that sounds interesting. What's that? Then when
262120	267680	I read thinking in systems, it was a massive aha. There is no turning back
267680	273040	from this. And why wasn't I taught economics in systems thinking? Why
273040	276480	weren't we taught to think of the economy as a complex adaptive system in
276480	281040	feedback loops? So it was a real deep frustration with what I'd been taught
281040	284640	and, and just a thrill of finding these ideas. And it was this collective
284640	288800	series of aha's that made me think, I want to make these ideas dance on the
288800	293640	same page. That's what led me to read, to write donor economics. I want to see
293640	296480	what happens when you bring Eleanor Ostrom's comments theory together with
296480	299560	Danela Meadows thinking in systems together with Herman Daley's ecological
299560	303640	economics together with feminist economics. What do we get next? So it was
303640	306400	definitely these aha moments that brought me back.
306800	312520	Why don't we teach thinking in systems and, and these planetary boundaries and
312520	316120	some of the things you just mentioned to undergrads in college?
318120	322840	Because the mainstream economic textbook and thinking and the ideology
322840	328800	behind it is a self contained self affirming system that has worked very
328800	334000	well nicely. Thank you for decades and carries on being taught and students
334000	338560	keep enrolling for economics. And I think there's a real inertia of
340560	346440	self questioning when inside the discipline. And why disrupt something
346440	350120	that has apparently been working? I mean, to me, the most radical act in
350120	354400	economics would be to draw Herman Daley's circle of the biosphere around
354440	358880	every single model of the economy. Why don't we do that? Because that's what
358880	364360	changes everything. And I think there's it changes the professor's
364400	367920	professionalism, it changes who is the expert here, it changes the
367920	373480	foundations of analysis. So it causes a massive disruption in the
373480	376000	hierarchies that have been built up around which are the best journals,
376000	378960	which are the best frameworks, what's taken as given, I mean, supply and
378960	382240	demand curves, they haven't been peer reviewed, the exponential growth
382280	386360	curve for an economy that was never peer reviewed. But it's just taken as a
386360	390400	foundational assumption now. So it's much harder to move away from that
390400	393600	system because everything and if we knew paradigms, well, has it been
393600	398240	peer reviewed? So I think that's why we see the build up of new economic
398240	402720	thinking often outside major economics departments because the new
402720	406440	thinking is coming from elsewhere rather than within. But what thrills me is
406440	410120	that students in high school, whether they're, you know, 14 year olds or
410120	412480	whether they're 18 year olds or whether they're undergraduates or
412480	416880	master students, they know that the ideas that will serve them to be
416920	421920	economists, household managers, right? Planetary scale, household managers
421920	424440	of the future, they know that the ideas that will serve them are not the ones
424440	427400	that are contained only in those textbooks, they are coming to these
427400	428080	new ideas.
429040	434000	So I taught for eight years a class called Reality 101. And in my
434000	438920	experience, the students that had never had an economics class, like
438920	443240	immediately got the content in my class. But it was the ones that had had an
443240	447560	economics class that there was this like mental speed bump they had to get
447560	451600	over on the assumptions and other things. It was very interesting to
451600	452160	observe.
452400	456280	Yeah, and there's a great quote from Cain, he said something like, it's not
456280	460160	the new ideas that are difficult. It's getting the old ones out of our heads
460160	463720	that have been ramified into the corner of our minds. How do we escape
463720	470200	paradigms? So that to me is why I care most about, let's call it Econ 101, I
470200	473520	care most about the first course that any student encounters, often
473520	478200	professors, when they're pushing back against what I'm doing, they say, Oh,
478200	482200	you know, you're just talking about Econ 101. I mean, it gets far more
482200	486000	sophisticated than this. I would argue it doesn't, they don't suddenly bring
486000	489120	the planet in when you're when you're a master student or something. But the
489120	493240	very first encounter we have with what is the economy, what is the range of
493240	498000	its scope? What are the foundational metrics? Is it price in the market? What
498000	502120	are the foundational institutions that we care about? These profoundly shape our
502120	505280	worldviews and pictures profoundly shape our worldviews. That's what I've
505280	509840	really learned, the power of pictures. And so if you want to dislodge a model, I
509840	513360	think the best way is to propose a new model, right, Buckminster Fuller, right?
513400	517800	You change things by making the old model obsolete, propose something new. So
517800	521800	that's why the work I've done is really focused on proposing new pictures,
521800	527600	because the power of our visual sight, going into our visual cortex, it really
527600	531880	shapes what we see and what we don't see, what's central, what's peripheral. So
531920	535080	that's to me, the most important economics course to change.
536280	541560	Well, let's let's get into that. Your very popular book, Donut Economics,
542360	548120	highlighted the outer core, or the outer ring, which is the planetary boundaries
548120	554240	that we don't want to exceed. And then the inner ring was the human needs for
554240	558960	well being, the things that we don't want to go below. And in it, talking about
558960	567440	visuals and orthodox economics, you outlined a list of old economic thinking
567440	574320	like 20th century and new 21st century economics. And maybe you could either
574320	578280	visually or we could put up one of your graphics, just give a kind of a brief
578280	580800	summary of the, I think you had seven points.
581760	584600	Yeah. So first of all, let me say that it was really important to me what I was
584600	589000	aiming to do in that book was to set out ways of thinking, right? It's principles
589000	593240	of thinking that will then be adapted over time between different countries that
593240	598360	will be relevant differently in Malawi or Sweden, but also that'll change over
598360	603320	time as suddenly AI appears or as crises hit. So I wasn't trying to say these are
603320	606960	other policies that we should implement, but rather, what are some of the ways of
606960	611000	thinking that will equip us to go well? And I'm sure there's many more. But yeah,
611000	615480	here's seven. And I'm just for the fun of it with you. I'm going to see if I can
615480	619080	show them quickly visually. This is going to be kind of like a doughnut economics
619080	622600	circus big tent. So let's see if I can do this. So seven ways to think the first
622600	628440	one, change the goal. The goal of 20th century economics was endless growth,
628440	631440	right? There we go. Endless growth curve. It was just implicitly underlying
631480	636240	everything that we said we were aiming for, success of the economy. No, that is
636240	640520	not a sufficient statement of what success looks like. And we know that
640520	644560	endless growth actually takes us into a lot of problems. So we need, here we go,
644560	647880	the doughnut that you just described, a goal that says, leave no one falling
647880	652000	short in the hole, but don't overshoot Earth's limits. Get everybody over the
652000	656000	social foundation inside the ecological ceiling. We want to meet the needs of all
656000	659280	people within the means of the living planet. It's a goal that brings together
659280	663280	human rights and ecological integrity. And I say, okay, that's the starting point
663280	667320	on day one. Bang, this is where we begin. What kind of economic system will
667320	673120	actually take us there? So number one, change the goal. Two, see the big picture,
673120	678080	right? If that's the compass, what's the map? The map of economics. All mainstream
678080	683200	economics courses start with this little diagram, supply and demand. Now, that's a
683200	687600	big act to put supply and demand on the screen on day one. It means we put the
687600	691360	market at the center of our vision. It means we make price, the metric of
691360	694920	concern, and everything that falls outside the price contract gets called an
694920	698760	externality. That's a big framing choice of the death of the living world. Oh, it's
698760	702640	an environmental externality. That is not nearly a big enough picture. There are
702640	706120	no externalities, as Herman Daley and I would say. Your model is just not big
706120	711560	enough. So I drew a diagram. Here's my embedded economy diagram. Here you go.
711560	715600	Let's see if we can show this. So this brings together ecological economics. It
715600	720840	brings together complexity. It brings together feminist economics and
720840	726720	common thinking. The economy is embedded in society, is embedded in the living
726720	730480	world. It is a subsystem and utterly dependent upon it. But also the economy
730480	734160	is made up not just of the market in the state, that very 20th century boxing
734160	738520	match, the household, the space of unpaid caring work, typically done by women, and
738520	743040	the commons and an Ostrom space where we co-create goods and services of value. If
743040	746160	we start with this big picture of the economy and recognize that all economic
746160	750840	activity has to operate within the planetary boundaries and we can use
750840	755360	these different forms of provisioning, to me this is just so much a richer
755360	761400	starting point for all macroeconomic modeling. So number two, change, get
761400	767040	the big picture. Number three, nurture human nature. Who is humanity? How do we
767040	770360	tell ourselves the story of who we are in this picture? The portrait of
770400	775560	humanity. In 20th century economics, this guy, here we are, he's framed. This is
775560	778960	a rational economic man. I decided to draw him to make him visible. He would be
778960	783760	a man standing alone, no dependence. He's got money in his hand, he's got ego in
783760	788160	his heart, he's got calculator in his head, and he'd have nature at his feet. He
788160	791960	hates work, he loves luxury, he knows the price of everything. The real problem
791960	797360	with this depiction is that the more the students told, oh yes, this model is a
797840	803040	sufficient model of us. Actually, we start to mimic him. Students say over time
803040	808880	they more value competition and self-interest over altruism and
808880	812040	collaboration because they start to mimic the model. So who we tell ourselves we
812040	816320	are, shapes who we become. Instead of this rational economic man, we need to
816320	820520	recognize we are first the most social of all mammals. We are social, we are
820520	826160	adaptable, we are heuristic, we care about other's opinions, we follow the
826160	831960	crowd, we are learning. So we have to start with the reality of humanity, which
831960	836600	we learned from cognitive behavior, psychology, from sociology, a much richer
836600	841160	picture of humanity. Now before, we've got to get savvy with systems. So instead
841160	846080	of assuming the economy is in equilibrium, like that supply and demand curve
846080	849480	showed us, recognize that it's almost probably never going to be there. It's a
849480	853440	complex adaptive system. For this, my favorite shape, little donut, springs into
853760	860440	a complex adaptive system of interlinked dynamics, reinforcing feedback, balancing
860440	865240	feedback, tipping points, delay, resilience, redundancy. That's the world of
865240	869360	D'Nelamedo's. So think of it as a complex adaptive system that will ever be
869360	873280	evolving. We can't control it. There's no levers to pull. The best we can hope for
873280	878120	is to steward that system. So how do we want to steward that system? We want to
878120	883640	steward it away from being deeply divisive. We've inherited a divisive
883640	886760	economy that captures value and opportunity in the hands of a few. Here's
886760	891800	the rise of the 1%. We need to turn it, steward that system into a much more
891800	895960	distributive economy. There we go. A system that shares value and opportunity
895960	900080	with all who co-create it. How can we make a distributive economy? So from
900320	905600	divisive to distributive, second big dynamic that we can steward in this
905600	910280	complex adaptive system is from linear and degenerative, stick it in the pipe
910280	914080	of production, make staff throw it away. That's what pushes us over plentary
914080	919280	boundaries into a circular or cyclical regenerative economy where we use
919280	922480	resources again and again from a collectively, carefully, creatively
922480	927040	and slowly. So from degenerative to regenerative, from divisive to
927040	932600	distributive. And then this takes us to the seventh principle that what is the
932600	936440	future of economic growth? What does the future look like? And I'm coming
936440	940480	back to where we began. The presumption was economies would just keep growing
940480	945080	forever. This says, well, maybe actually we need to be agnostic about growth
945080	948440	because what we really want are regenerative economies and distributive
948440	951680	economies. And there might come some point, indeed, they probably have already
951680	955440	come to it, especially in high-income economies where they need to grow up,
955480	959680	right? Nothing in nature succeeds by growing forever. It goes through a
959680	963560	growth phase and then it grows up and matures. What would it mean to create
963560	966920	economies that actually mature? Because if we don't do that, we're going to get
966920	970960	that. We're going to induce collapse, which is something very close to your
971640	975680	heart and focus and thoughts, right? So how can we not break? How can we bend?
976080	979960	How can we bend this system so that actually matures and grows up? So those
979960	983720	are the seven ways to think. And let me just say again, that's just seven. Those
983720	986800	are the ones that became really clear and obvious to me. I bet there's more.
987760	989680	And I offer people to keep adding to them.
991760	992520	Bravo.
993160	993720	That was fun.
993760	999480	I might have to make this entire interview a best of clip. That was very
999480	1002680	impressive. Thank you so much for your work. While you were doing that, I
1002680	1007440	wondered if you hadn't chose being an economist, you could have been like a
1007440	1012240	stand-up comedian. And this stuff is not funny, though. That's the problem,
1012240	1017920	right? You have such a good delivery and are clearly very knowledgeable and
1017920	1023320	passionate. But these are really serious topics that we need to pass the baton
1023320	1029720	to our youth and people all around the world. And yeah, it feels good because
1029720	1036120	we're on the right side of the ledger of humanity and the biosphere. But we're
1036120	1044160	in a very tough moment. And what you just described, I just fantasize about
1044400	1049680	leaders when Danela Meadows was working on these things in the 70s, had we
1049680	1055160	adopted some of this thinking then, but we were in the thralls of massive
1055160	1061000	energy surplus. The thing that I would add to your list is economics has
1061000	1069320	focused on cost, not value. And energy for what we pay for, just the cost of
1069320	1075520	extraction, gives orders of magnitude more value to the human enterprise than
1075520	1079800	its cost. That's a big flag in economic theory.
1081320	1088520	I think for me, what comes very clearly from your work is if I was to go back
1088520	1092600	and add to what I wrote about a little bit, but more that the fundamental
1092600	1096960	currency of our economies, if we really want to get down to currency and
1096960	1102200	evaluation, energy is the second law of thermodynamics. It's the fundamental
1102200	1106640	currency of life. And so we would do a lot, we would do really well to pay a lot
1106640	1110440	more attention to energy. Exactly as you just said, it's treated in economics as
1110440	1114680	a cost and it's, well, it's been very low. But actually to understand energy and
1114720	1118760	materiality, and I mean materials, the actual real materials of the world and
1118760	1122960	the relationship between energy use and material use and its boundedness and
1122960	1127160	its relationship between that and the delicate balance of the ecosystems,
1127160	1131520	the planetary boundaries, the life support systems of Earth, to understand
1131520	1135080	the interrelatedness of those things, coming back to a point Satish Kumar
1135080	1140120	from makes, how can you claim to be an economist if you don't yet understand
1140120	1144160	ecology, the living world, the systems on which we depend, the cycles on which we
1144160	1149080	depend, the materials at hand, it's a deeply physical and energy based system.
1151120	1155000	I've been using this new chart, I'll send it to you after we're done a little
1155000	1161120	triangle that shows politics, money and technology as describing society. But
1161120	1164760	then you blow up the screen and that's just a little triangle on the top and
1164760	1170520	underneath it is this huge energy like flame. And that's underpinning all that.
1170560	1174760	And then you blow it up even further and underneath that is the biosphere and
1174760	1181200	the ecosystem services of Earth that support all of that. So I mean, what is
1181200	1187880	the response from standard economists at your school at Oxford or around the
1187880	1193920	world? Are they ignoring this message from donut economics or are they
1193920	1200120	ridiculing it or I mean it just seems like so much obvious common sense. Or
1200160	1205000	do they secretly agree with you but the incentive structures of status and
1205000	1209360	tenure and jobs preclude them from publicly agreeing with you?
1209800	1216000	So when my book first came out in 2017, there was a lot of ignore. That's the
1216000	1218600	first line of defense, isn't it right? If something's threatening, either
1218600	1224840	ignore or kill it sort of. And so there's also some ridicule. Or the first
1224840	1228120	comeback was this isn't economics. Now, oh, no, no, you've put your values in
1228120	1231600	here. You see by starting with the donut by starting with human rights and
1231600	1236400	ecological, you started with your values, which astounded me. Maybe wait, when
1236400	1240840	you start with supply and demand of the market, do you think you're starting
1240840	1246240	with no values? Do you not realize that everything is starting with a set of
1246240	1250480	values of what we choose to show, what we choose to measure and what we choose
1250480	1256480	to call success. But I have to say there are of course there are, well, the
1256640	1260840	ecological economists started using it immediately because it brought a visual
1260840	1264400	to what they and the inheritors of Herman Daley's work have been doing for
1264400	1268680	decades. Feminist economists, urban studies. So outside of economics
1268680	1271080	departments, many, many other people started using it business schools
1271080	1275400	because business happens in the world in the materiality of climate impacts and
1275960	1280520	labor, labor issues. So it made sense to them. And increasingly, there are
1280520	1283920	people teaching economics in mainstream departments who more and more, I mean, I
1283960	1287040	only find out about it when I find out about it, right? You only know what you
1287040	1290480	know, hear of, who get in touch and say, I'm introducing this into my macro
1290480	1293960	economics class. Partly, I think, because there's a generation of students
1293960	1297240	coming through who put up their hand and say, what about planetary boundaries?
1297240	1301440	What about the donut? The demand is coming from the students. That's more
1301440	1305000	and more where I see that it's come into economics departments because the
1305000	1310560	student body are born in, you know, the climate strikers are now at
1310600	1315200	university. And I see that in the group of students I teach myself. And so
1315200	1320200	they're coming with a much more political economy expectation of their
1320200	1323000	education and they're expecting to be taught tools that will actually
1323000	1326800	equip them with the crisis that they've been born into. So they are pushing
1327160	1330760	that agenda in a really positive way. But I, instead of trying to hammer on
1330760	1334600	the door of economics departments that are shut, I've never done that. I go
1334600	1337640	where the energy is, where the interest is, because there's lots of it. And it's
1337840	1344120	in other departments that are grounded in real world challenges. Like I said,
1344120	1348440	like urban design, urban studies, architects, doctors actually, doctors
1348440	1351360	who recognize human health and planetary health are deeply into woven. They're
1351360	1354600	bringing it into their degrees. So I'm just going with that energy. And I
1354600	1358080	believe economics, it's a question to economics. Are you, is economics
1358080	1361680	going to catch up and embed itself in the real world as other disciplines
1361680	1365200	are doing? And then it will start bringing this in as it is already
1365240	1365840	creeping in.
1366840	1374400	Personally, I don't think economics will ever voluntarily give up the throne. I
1374400	1378000	think we'll have to have a crisis. And then new ideas that are laying around
1378000	1384600	will replace the the brittle and outdated 20th century models. Perhaps yours
1384600	1388120	would be one of them. But I don't think they're going to say, Yeah, you know
1388120	1394400	what, Kate's right. That's just not the way of human status and metabolism. I
1394400	1394960	don't think
1395080	1399200	I agree. And that but what I do know is they're going to be crises and
1399200	1403000	they're coming and more and more that these crises come that and I think it's
1403000	1407000	in part why the donut framework. Oh, yeah, there we are. This speaks to food
1407000	1412480	prices and energy and climate impacts. And it it holds that space. But as you
1412480	1416680	just in passing quoted Milton Friedman, right, when when crises come, people
1416680	1420360	turn to the ideas that are lying around at the time. And I like to say, Well, why
1420360	1423800	just leave them lying around? Let's have them up and running. And that's why I
1423800	1428480	co founded donut economic Action Lab. Because when my book came out, what
1428480	1432640	thrilled me was that I was approached by people who say, I like the ideas. And I
1432640	1435920	want to do this. Some of them were teachers in school, I'm teaching this to
1435920	1438040	the kids now it's not the syllabus, but this is what they should be learning.
1438280	1444120	Some of them were city councillors, city mayors, state legislators, we want to
1444120	1449640	put this into practice where we are. So we work with them to start seeding this
1449640	1452320	possibility. And what does it look like when they actually try and start putting
1452320	1456400	these ideas into practice so that as crises come, we can say like as of today,
1456400	1460880	I can say there are 70 city and local state district governments around the
1460880	1464520	world who've already chosen to start working with this model to bring about
1464520	1469560	the transition that they know they want to create this seeds and grounds proof of
1469560	1473800	practice of a concept so that as crisis hit, it's it's got that credibility, it's
1473800	1476080	got that critical mass of actual practical use.
1477080	1484600	Yeah, so my podcast and my work is still mostly about educational, but you're
1484600	1489640	actually taking doughnut economics, the book, the concepts and putting them into
1489640	1495200	practice in your lab. You just mentioned 70 communities, cities around the world
1495200	1499640	like, how are they putting them into practice? Can you give some example or
1499640	1501960	progress updates or interesting stories?
1502960	1506400	So I can give you an example and that those 70 are of local governments.
1506400	1511120	There's a whole other group of community organizations starting it up, but local
1511120	1516520	governments. So the way it, having watched it from it began in April 2020 in the
1516520	1521600	height of the COVID crisis, Amsterdam, we created a city portrait for them
1521600	1524760	downscaling the doughnut to the city. What would it mean for this city to aim to
1524760	1527520	live in the doughnut? And they launched it in the midst of COVID because they said,
1527520	1530360	well, we're in emergency, we're in a crisis right now. But as we emerge from
1530400	1533720	crisis, they will be funding, the economy will be opening up again. It's that
1533720	1536400	question, which direction are we going to go in, right? Don't waste the
1536400	1541160	opportunity for crisis to change your direction. They introduced it at the
1541160	1545720	heart of their policy to become a circular city. So they said, they had a
1545720	1550640	vision to create 100% circular by 2050, 50% circular by 2030. And they
1550640	1554720	recognize that circularity doesn't just mean changing the flow of materials,
1554720	1558680	it's not merely materials, it has deep implications for livelihoods, for
1559560	1564240	distribution, for people's access to transport and food and clothing. So they
1564240	1567640	wanted to bring the social in, and that's why they saw the doughnut really help
1567640	1571840	bring together the ecological and social in terms of a bigger vision of a
1571840	1576360	circularity policy. And that was a good example of a place that already has a
1576360	1581200	vision for transformation, put it together with their vision to get rid of all
1581200	1586120	fossil fuel transport in the city by 2030. So they're really transforming
1586160	1590960	some big systems here. The doughnut serves as a visual clear compass that
1590960	1595120	brings it all together. And so often that's the way I see it happening. It's
1595120	1599040	not as if, you know, city mayor sees the doughnut says, oh, that's an amazing
1599040	1603880	idea. Now what shall we do? It's going to be seen by people in places who
1603880	1608240	already have this sense of we need to transition, we need to transform our
1608240	1612800	systems, our energy, our transport, our housing, our food systems. They come
1612840	1617440	across the doughnut. This really helps bring together these ideas in a clear
1617440	1621600	way that we can communicate. And it's like a big sale on our ship. It's very
1621880	1625880	compelling vision. And also we're joining others doing it. I've just come back
1625880	1631400	from Cunobl in France, where the city have one of the most recent cities to
1631400	1634320	say, yep, we're adopting the doughnut. So they they downscale it to the
1634320	1638160	national level, I mean, to the city level. And they actually collect the
1638160	1641040	metrics. What would it mean for everybody here to thrive? And is our local
1641080	1644600	ecology thriving? Do we have thriving nature in the city? Are we coming back
1644600	1647760	with implantary boundaries? And what's our impact on people worldwide through
1647760	1651480	global supply chains? And what kind of metrics could we collect? So that this
1651480	1655840	replaces, for example, saying, I'm making the stat up. But for example, they
1655840	1660080	might say, oh, you know, good knobs, GDP is increased by 1.3% over the last
1660080	1666080	year. I mean, is that is that good or bad? Or what? How will I know anything
1666080	1670560	from that? But if I'm measuring the metrics of a place in real terms, in
1670560	1673440	terms of people's lives, in terms of the ecological health and its impact in
1673440	1678160	the world, it's, it's a real story and a much more detailed story about what's
1678160	1683120	happening here. So they've introduced it. They're like many cities transforming
1683120	1688800	their transport systems, getting reducing cars, bringing in public transit, and
1688800	1693120	much more cycling. They've introduced a tax on property, actually, because they
1693120	1696880	said we have huge inequality in our city, we need to reduce the inequalities. So
1696880	1701760	this is a quite an elected local government with pretty progressive
1701760	1705760	mandate that are saying, yeah, this helps us go in that direction. And just in
1705760	1710000	terms of the kinds of actions that I see when I go to cities like Karnob, like
1710000	1714880	Barcelona, like Copenhagen, what recurs to me again and again is a beautiful
1714880	1719200	phrase that the environmental journalist George Mombio once wrote. He wrote
1719200	1724560	about the UK. He said, look, what we have here is private luxury and public
1724560	1729360	squalor. And what we need is public luxury and private
1729360	1733680	sufficiency. And when I go to places like these cities, I see, ah, yeah, this is
1733680	1738720	what public luxury looks like, fantastic public parks, incredible mobility, low
1738720	1745040	cost, fast, clean, efficient transport, good quality social housing.
1745040	1748080	And we have private sufficiency. And in France, there's a word that's really
1748080	1751680	gaining currency, sobriety. If you say sobriety in English, people think, oh,
1751680	1754560	you're not going to drink alcohol anymore. It's got that very literal meaning.
1754560	1760320	But sobriety in France means a dignified sense of I have enough. This is
1760320	1765840	sufficient. My material needs are met. My mind and my intellectual life and my
1765840	1770080	cultural and common's life is flourishing. But sobriety, it's a, it's a,
1770080	1773360	it's really interesting to see the way this is gaining traction. In Sweden, they
1773360	1778240	have a term lagom, which means I have plenty and it's enough. And we need
1778240	1782560	language like this in more and more cultures to be able to express that
1782560	1786240	sense of private sufficiency and public luxury. And that's where we should be
1786240	1789760	seeking abundance. So again and again, I see cities that are actually starting to
1789760	1793120	put this into practice. That's the vision that they're starting to bring about.
1793760	1799280	I love it. I have so many questions. So here's, here's the challenge that I see.
1799280	1804400	Last week, I was in Germany and I spoke to a large audience of climate, energy,
1804480	1809040	tech investors with the basic messages, we're not going to solve climate change
1809040	1814240	and help the environment by growing the economy by electric cars and things like
1814240	1821120	that. And I expected it to not go well, but it went really well. And
1822320	1827680	like this is a Dinella Meadows thing. You can't understand our situation unless
1827680	1831920	you look at the whole system. And the people in the room, I told them they
1831920	1838160	were wearing three hats. One was their hat as the managers of the Sovereign Wealth Fund of
1838160	1844560	Norway or Fidelity or whatever, where they have to generate returns for their investors. The other
1844560	1851760	hat was their father, mother, sister, parents, whatever, they want to do the right thing for
1851760	1855680	their family. And then the third thing is they want to do the right thing for the world as a
1855680	1863440	citizen of the world. The challenges is that our prices and our incentives and our cultural
1863440	1872880	aspirations are having them focus on that first hat, where there is not a common plan of action
1872880	1879360	where all three of those hats can align. And I would imagine that if we had better prices
1880000	1887760	on non-renewable inputs, if we had a complementary metric to GDP, because I think GDP does
1888640	1894160	still have some uses, but if there was a well-being metric attached to it for context,
1894880	1902480	and then suddenly all of your book and all of your seven points would scale massively. But until
1902480	1909280	that happens, the incentives and the prices that basically we just pay for the cost of extraction,
1909280	1917360	not the cost of creation or pollution on our main goods, are not going to allow communities and
1917360	1921520	cities and nations to embrace this writ large. What are your thoughts on that?
1922480	1927120	So I love those three hats. I think many people are realizing over time that those
1927840	1933360	second and third hats, I want to be a good parent and I want to be a good citizen of the world,
1933360	1938960	these are coming much, much closer together. So I have 14-year-old twins. If I imagine what will
1938960	1945040	the world be like when they are 80 or 90, then I believe there's nothing I can do to protect them
1946400	1951520	that doesn't actually involve protecting the world because we utterly depend upon a thriving world.
1951520	1957120	So if you want to be a good parent, you need to care for the whole world and system. As Jeanine
1957120	1962880	Beniaz always beautifully says, you know, a species and a platter or an animal can't be around for
1962880	1967120	10,000 generations, so it takes care of the place that will take care of its offspring,
1967120	1974480	and that's the best we can do. I completely agree that the incentives for the manager of a, well,
1974480	1980640	Norway's sovereign wealth fund, there's a lot of realigning to do that. But if any major corporate
1980640	1986480	designed company, the incentives are way off. So just to come directly to your point about prices,
1986480	1991520	yes, the price incentives are way out. I would fix it not only through changing prices, but
1992160	1995920	this will also change prices through changing regulations. So I really believe, you know,
1995920	2000240	I don't think you're advocating, you know, set the right price and the quantity will fix itself.
2000240	2004320	Like, I really like what Amsterdam are doing. They're just saying, in 2020, they said,
2004960	2010800	in 10 years time, in 2030, there will be no fossil fuel vehicles in the city, no boats, no cars.
2010800	2015840	So guys get, you've got a long, loud legal message. It's very clear this is the transformation that's
2015840	2020480	happening. So nobody changed the price on that day, but they changed all the signals. And of course,
2020480	2024800	that has knock on effects of changing all the future expected price. So we need to put in
2024800	2029920	place regulations that just remove life-destroying chemistry and introduce only life-friendly
2029920	2033840	chemistry that just remove fossil fuels from the system. And so that we put in that long,
2033840	2038080	loud legal message that the system will start to adapt. But I also want to come back to the
2038080	2043920	point you say that the managers are not facing the right incentives. We can change the prices
2043920	2051120	that they face, the incentives around them. We can also change the deep design of the
2051120	2057040	organizations they work for. And one more piece of puppet show. This to me is a really key one.
2057040	2061280	And in fact, you know, if I could go back and rewrite a section of joint economics,
2061280	2064160	this is one thing that I would bring up much more clearly. And it comes from the work of
2064160	2068560	Marjorie Kelly, who's a next generation enterprise designer working for the Democracy
2068560	2076640	Collaborative in the US. Marjorie's book that I read, Regenerative Ownership, she, or owning
2076640	2081360	our future, it's called, she said, you know, you need to look at the deep design of an enterprise.
2082000	2086800	So here's the five deep design traits, right? What is the purpose of this enterprise?
2086800	2090720	Why does it even exist? What is it in service of in the world? How is it networked with its
2090720	2095200	employees, its suppliers, its customers, its industry allies? What relationships does it
2095200	2099040	hold? Does it see everybody else as a competitor or the allies in transformation? How is it
2099040	2102400	governed? Who's at the table who has voice and decision making? What are the metrics?
2103760	2109200	How is it owned by shareholders, by a family for 300 years, by venture capital, by the workers,
2109200	2112400	by the state, because how its own is going to profoundly shape how it's financed,
2112400	2117920	where that finance is coming from, and what therefore it's expecting or extracting or demanding?
2117920	2121520	And so is it, is the governance ownership and finance going to be in line with
2121520	2125600	maximizing returns to the owners, which is a very 20th century corporate design,
2125600	2129520	or is it actually going to be in line with serving the purpose, which might be sequestering carbon,
2129520	2133920	building community, creating health? So to me, if I was looking around that room,
2135120	2141600	I would say, yeah, you're wearing a hat of the manager of the fund and strapped to your body
2141600	2147280	is a structural design that is informing what you can and can't do, what doesn't,
2147280	2153440	doesn't have materiality in your decision making, so in addition to prices. And how can we change
2153440	2157760	these deep designs of institutions? So at Donatee Economic Section Lab, we're working with companies
2157760	2161280	that many companies come to us and say, oh, we want to do business in the donut. We say, fine,
2161280	2163920	we don't want to talk about the design of your products. I'm sure they're very nice. We don't
2163920	2167440	want to talk about the design of that. We want to talk about the design of your company, because
2167440	2172720	this is ultimately going to determine whether or not your company can become regenerative
2172720	2176960	and distributive of the value it creates, sharing that value with all those through the supply chain
2176960	2183360	rather than maximizing returns to the owners, the shareholders, or not, whether it's stuck in an old
2183360	2187760	pattern. Because what we find when we talk to companies, I'll give you one example. I was at
2187760	2191440	a circular economy conference last summer and somebody came up to me and she said, you know,
2191440	2198400	I, she worked for a major clothing company. She said, I'm head of regenerative clothing,
2198400	2202560	and I've been asked to, or the sustainability, I've been asked to come up with a line of regenerative
2202560	2207040	clothing for our company to signal we're part of this revolution. But I'm being told I have to
2207040	2213200	generate 15% profit returns or profit margins on it from the get go, the standard. There's absolutely
2213200	2217760	no room for this transformation. She said, it's impossible. I cannot do it. So these companies
2217760	2223120	want the regenerative label, the regenerative, but they want the bottom line because of the
2223120	2226880	way they're designed and owned and financed. We need to change that deep design.
2230160	2238160	So, okay, I'm with you on that, except our entire edifice is supported by the
2238880	2244960	one-time endowment of the carbon pulse. So I don't know in donut economics and the planetary
2244960	2254560	boundaries, it seems like we're avoiding exceeding nitrogen, CO2, you know, biodiversity limits,
2254560	2259760	and that these communities are responding because they, they don't want to exceed those and they're
2259760	2266160	making like Grenoble and those other places you talked about. How much of it is in response to
2266640	2274960	not publicly aware yet, but anticipated depletion of these energy helpers that we get annually the
2274960	2281360	equivalent of 500 billion human laborers worth of energy that we're just pulling from the ground?
2281360	2289360	Because as a corporation that wants to make regenerative clothing and needs to make 15%
2289360	2294560	a year, if you get these cheap fossil helpers, that's going to help you meet your bottom line
2295040	2300880	a lot easier. So how do we manage that? How does that fit into the story here?
2302560	2310320	Well, as you said, this one of carbon pulse, it's, it's got a pulse away, right? Whether it's
2310320	2316160	through peak or whether the evident impacts in the world we need to let go of it and that's the
2316160	2322640	heart of your work, what happens next. I agree that, so going back to the way economics is taught,
2322640	2328160	we are not taught economics saying, here you are on any course in the early 21st century,
2328160	2332800	by the way, you're studying economics at the end of a one off massive carbon pulse,
2332800	2339520	which has created abnormal temporary conditions, one of which the most important of which is
2339520	2346080	because of the availability of cheap energy, it's given us phenomenal uplift of growth.
2346080	2350160	And we've come to think that was normal and we, right, we need to be aware that that was
2350160	2356720	historic and that's not the future. So how do we move away from that? That's why I think it's
2356720	2360960	important to question growth, but I want to come back and question the design of the company,
2360960	2365200	because the way these companies are designed, they're designed on the presumption of growth
2365200	2369760	and therefore the, the, you know, the planet may be, the planet may be going to hand the
2369760	2374880	handcuff, but I want my 15% and that's still deeply written into the mindset, you know,
2374880	2381040	this coming out of the financial community, right? I want my high returns that, and that hasn't
2381680	2386800	modified at all in terms of the reality of what can actually be regenerated on a planet that
2386800	2394720	isn't depending on the extraordinary free cheap labor of fossil fuel, but actually comes back
2394720	2400640	within the regenerative capacity of renewable energies. To me, that's the, that, that's your,
2400640	2405600	that's your question. Are we, are we going to get this before it breaks us? Will we get this and
2405600	2410400	learn to bend? And for me, part of the bending is bending in the design of institutions. So we
2410400	2415280	create companies that don't depend upon endless growth. They understand that they may grow until
2415280	2421600	they're mature in size and scale, but then they can thrive and they're not owned in ways that
2421600	2427360	continually expect to extract surplus profit because it's not going to come. It needs to be
2427360	2431760	reinvested in the enterprise, which is invested in regenerating the world.
2433200	2438080	You first need to understand it before you can do it. So this is very important, I think. One of my
2438640	2444960	first podcast guests was Danella Meadows, husband, Dennis Meadows, and when asked what are some of
2444960	2453280	the pathways forward, he's like one of the prerequisites is to extend the time horizons
2453280	2459360	of institutions from quarterly or yearly to five years or 10 years or 20 years.
2459920	2464720	So there's something that some friends of mine are working on called the long-term stock exchange,
2464720	2473280	which is to duly list current companies on this long-term stock exchange, which makes decisions
2473280	2479600	for all three hats that I mentioned earlier simultaneously, because otherwise we're just
2479600	2487680	in this short term have to get the 15% now. We can't look at the impact on the planet and
2487680	2493120	depletion and these other things. So maybe that's one of the pathways.
2493120	2499200	Yeah. So I'm going to come back here. Whenever I hear an innovation like that, I come back here
2499200	2505040	and I think, which bit of this deep design of the enterprise or its environment are you there for
2506000	2511200	adapting? So if you've got the long-term stock exchange, is that going to influence how,
2511200	2515680	how is that going to influence how the company's governed? Are you putting, for example, you could
2515680	2521440	have, if it's a shareholder and company, you could have shares, you know, different voting
2521440	2526080	rights for shares that are held over decades or that you're committed to hold for many decades,
2526080	2531040	so that you give more voting to the long-term view than to the short-term view. Other companies like
2531040	2536480	Faith and Nature, a shampoo and beauty company, they recently put, literally one of their 11
2536480	2540400	directors has become nature. They've put nature on the board because they said, we kept asking,
2540400	2544320	what would nature do? Well, let's stop asking this as a sort of hypothetical question. Let's
2544320	2550720	put nature on the board. So nature is represented by an environmental lawyer who says in bringing
2550720	2556800	naturally a long-term view because nature wants to be the infinite game and thrive forever.
2556800	2562480	So what would nature vote for us to do on the board? So all sorts of changes that go on between
2563280	2568320	how the company's owned and governed, bringing in innovations like that, I think this is,
2568320	2573600	this is really where the future of enterprise design lies and what it depends upon, because if we
2573600	2581440	don't bring that longer-term and wider thinking in terms of nature's interest, the supply chain's
2581440	2585760	interest, the workers' interest, rather than it being dominated and owned by the interests of
2585760	2591200	finance, then we're just stuck in a model that's just in service to finance and not in service to
2591200	2596480	life. And to me, that's essentially what fascinates me with your work is this ultimate question of
2596480	2602480	what does it look like to design finance that's in service to life, that actually finance that could
2602480	2606880	contribute to be and be part of a regenerative system? Because the financial system we've created
2606880	2611840	is exponential and extractive and it's like the antithesis of a living system.
2612080	2618320	I fully agree. And the default trajectory is that the superorganism will eat the doughnut
2619920	2628800	unless things change. So the doughnut is your best known diagram, but you flashed one up earlier,
2629360	2637600	which I think is equally important, is the embedded economy that replaces the circular flow of goods
2637600	2646800	diagram. And in there, you had the household and the commons. And could you unpack that a little bit?
2646800	2653280	I mean, I assume the household, you're talking about the care economy. And could you expand on the
2653280	2658880	importance of that and why we need to include that in our metrics, et cetera, going forward?
2659440	2665520	Yeah. So the importance of, so economy and society in the living world, the importance for me of
2665520	2672800	dividing the economy up was because the very 20th century economic debate and the kind of the
2672800	2679040	debate between Milton Friedman and or Hayek and Keynes was very much about the relationship and
2679040	2684000	the roles of the market and the state. And if you focus in, it's fascinating, but if you focus
2684000	2687840	only on that, you get this very 20th century ideological boxing match, you know, you're a
2687840	2693040	free market, let's say for a capitalist or your state loving socialist. And in those were the
2693040	2699120	only two choices. Those are your only two choices, mate. It still goes on today. I mean, I find
2699120	2703680	extraordinary, particularly in the US, I find if you critique the market, oh, oh, oh, so you're
2703680	2709200	a communist? Like, is that it? So that's why I like to bring in new framing and not use that
2709200	2714240	language, just speaking in a different space. So the market and the state, of course, that's
2714240	2720320	what shows up in GDP. That's the market output of the economy. But the way I think of these four
2720320	2726160	sectors is they are four different ways, really useful ways, each of them, that we provision for
2726160	2730960	our needs and wants. So we can provision for our needs and wants through market based exchange,
2730960	2736320	through price based market. Adam Smith was onto something, right? The market is an amazing mechanism
2737120	2742320	with a lot of feedback loops through the price signal, sending messages to buyers and sellers
2742960	2748480	who never need to meet, who through that mechanism provide things that they want to supply and buy.
2749200	2756160	A couple of caveats, it only serves those who can pay the rest it ignores, and it only values
2756160	2760160	what's priced the rest it exploits. So big caveats, which is one of the reasons why we
2760160	2764080	obviously need the state, the state provisions, public services, public goods for all,
2764720	2769200	whether it's because it's a natural monopoly or because it's a human right. So we need that.
2769200	2772880	But this still leaves us in the kind of market state dichotomy in marketed goods.
2773680	2780080	Many other of our needs and wants are produced and provided through care, through unpaid caring work
2780080	2785760	in the household, where we all begin every day. It's the domain of the cooking, washing, cleaning,
2785760	2790880	sweeping, raising the kids, teaching them to be good members of society. None of which is included
2790880	2798480	in GDP. None of which, and yet which makes life work and it makes life worth it. And then the
2798480	2806400	Commons, which Ellen Ostrom bought from political science into economics and said, well, how people
2806400	2810960	collaborate not through markets and not through the state, but as a community, they come together
2810960	2816640	and co-create goods and services that they value collectively. And this can work very, very well.
2816640	2822480	Garrett Hardin said in the late 60s, oh, the Commons, it's a tragedy. And Ellen Ostrom
2822480	2826800	come along and says, well, you rift and sort of presume that the Commons is a tragedy. I actually
2826800	2832800	went and visited some, you know, they actually work really well, rice farmers in Nepal or fishermen
2832800	2838720	in Maine, and they actually managed to create rules that they follow together, collective
2838720	2844720	discussions, there are punishments for breaking the rules. There are all sorts of codes in place
2844720	2850640	that make the Commons work. So I think all economics should begin, you know, in a classroom
2850640	2855360	with 14 year olds, teach them these ideas and then just say, go out in the street, go out in the
2855360	2860800	street, just look around you. You'll see the market, you'll see the state, you'll see household care,
2860800	2866080	you'll see the Commons, you'll realize we're immersed in it all, all of the time. And therefore,
2866080	2871840	each one of us is a producer and a consumer. We play a role in markets. We're a citizen and a
2871840	2878880	resident or your parents may be a public servant, they may be a doctor or a teacher or a bureaucrat.
2878880	2883040	We're all immersed in households. What are you doing in a household and what's the
2883040	2887520	politics of household care? Who's doing that work? And we're all commoners, we're part of a club,
2887520	2894080	part of society. And we suddenly see a much fuller economic view of ourselves. And then you can start
2894080	2898320	talking about power, because there's a power relationship across every one of these lines,
2898320	2902800	the power between the market and the household. I know in the US, I understand that women have
2902800	2907680	like how many weeks maternity leave before they have to come back for work? You know,
2907680	2913760	it's just like weeks, whereas in Denmark, it's parental leave a year between both parents.
2913760	2918000	Very different negotiations of that market household relationship, but power between the
2918000	2921920	market and the state. Ronald Reagan famously told us to roll back the state, get out of the way.
2922560	2926240	Margaret Thatcher did the same. And I think we're seeing a lot of the consequences of this kind
2926240	2932240	of market fundamentalism, market crushing out the Commons, market society. Often people say we
2932240	2937120	live in a market society. And then are we now marketizing our relationship with the living
2937120	2941760	one? That's one of my concerns about bringing a market based economic language of natural
2941760	2947040	capital accounting or ecosystem valuation to the living world. But there's there's relationships,
2947040	2951360	power relationships across all of these lines. And last thing I'll say on this diagram, one of
2951360	2955920	the most interesting things is when you think about economic provisioning that happens across
2956640	2960800	these, so the state and the Commons, the state commons partnerships, how can the state be a
2960800	2967200	good partner to the Commons? How can the state support the household with childcare centers,
2967200	2973120	for example? How can the market and the Commons, you can have platform cooperativism, right? So
2973120	2977120	you can have a Commons platform and then people can run small market based enterprises on that
2977120	2982000	Commons. So some of the most interesting economic innovations in our economies are happening at
2982000	2985600	the intersections of these. And if you don't start by seeing them all of them, you'll miss it.
2985600	2990160	And you'll miss out that space of innovation. So yeah, this is this is a kind of base map.
2990160	2994080	If the donor is the compass, the embedded economy diagram is the base map. And it's,
2994080	2998880	it's a real tribute to Herman Daley, it says, whenever you see a diagram of economy,
2998880	3003360	you got to draw the living world around it and say, this is a closed system. And this is an
3003360	3008960	open subsystem, deal with it, create finance and create economic systems that actually
3009600	3011760	thrive within the dynamics of the living world.
3014000	3019200	Are you teaching right now, or are you full time with Donut Economics Action Lab and etc?
3020000	3025280	I do teach a little bit in one course in Oxford, but I threw Donut Economics Action Lab through
3025280	3031440	teaching in Oxford. So I actually, no, let me, let me rewind that. Two days after Herman Daley died,
3032320	3035760	I was giving a lecture on a kind of critiques of, you know, mainstream economics and new
3035760	3038720	economics. And some students rushed up to me afterwards and they just said,
3039840	3043280	why aren't all first year economic students taught these ideas? And there was this kind of
3043280	3047360	real frustration. And I just felt it was, it was because Herman Daley had just died and just this
3048320	3052000	damn, the baton has really been passed to this generation now. So I just thought,
3052000	3055600	why the heck isn't it not? So I live in Oxford, I haven't to live in Oxford, I moved here 20
3055600	3059600	years ago to work for Oxfam and here I am. So my local university, Oxford University,
3059600	3064960	and I, I teach there. And I thought, right, I'm going to put on a course that's open to all students
3064960	3068240	who come to the city of Oxford, where the Oxford University, Oxford Brooks University,
3068240	3074080	there are two universities here, to study economics in any kind. And it's free and it's on and it was
3074080	3078480	at night and it was student organized and it was fantastic. And we had 200 students do the whole
3078480	3084400	thing throughout eight weeks. Now, the reason I did it here in Oxford was to develop the materials
3084400	3090800	that I now want to turn into a course that we can share online with everybody. So part, and this
3090800	3096000	is my work at Donut Economics Action Lab. How do we, you know, the real question of Donut Economics
3096000	3099440	Action Lab is how can we put these ideas in the comments? I've now put all the ideas of Donut
3099440	3103680	Economics in the comments and we share them and we've turned them into tools for cities and tools
3103680	3108960	for communities and tools for business. We ask only as commoners, we ask that people share back
3108960	3113280	their learning and their innovation, because that's what means we collectively learn. But part of this
3113280	3120080	is the future that we plan is to provide more training, provide more courses, and provide the
3120080	3123920	materials for those courses so that other teachers can then say, great slide deck, thank you very
3123920	3127440	much. And now I'm going to go and teach that so that it spreads and scales. To me, always the
3127440	3132240	question is, how do we help these ideas spread and scale at the speed that these times demand? And
3132240	3137520	how do you do that with an openness of sharing, but also an integrity? Making sure the ideas don't
3137520	3142480	get greenwashed along the way. And so it's continually balancing that openness and integrity.
3142480	3146880	And that's why we're in Action Lab, actually. It's all about putting ideas into action and it's a lab
3146880	3152000	because the way we are aiming to do it, we're learning along the way as well how to design these
3152000	3157680	commons well so that they retain integrity, but that they can spread as fast as possible.
3157680	3161200	And I invite anybody listening to this to come and check out what we're doing at
3161280	3166560	DonutEconomics.org. You can see our platform, you can join, you can browse, you can use the tools.
3167120	3171520	Please be a good commenter if you use the tools, share back because we know that the peer-to-peer
3171520	3177440	inspiration, when a mayor says, I'm using this tool in our city, that's just massive inspiration and
3177440	3182720	has, you know, has directly traceable impacts on other mayors and councillors elsewhere who then
3182720	3187520	get the inspiration, but also somehow get the permission. It's time to move. Let's go. They're
3187520	3192800	going. Amsterdam's going, Copenhagen, Brussels, Barcelona, Grenoble. It's time to go. Epo in
3192800	3199040	Malaysia, South Hanna Bay in South Africa. We're on the move. If I had taken your class, if I had
3199040	3204400	been one of those 200 when I was 18 years old, it would have completely transformed my entire life.
3206000	3211360	Well, I think if I had taken Reality 101 with you and in many students, it would transform many,
3211360	3215120	many lives. And I think these are the foundational courses that a lot of students,
3215120	3221360	again, as I said, born into climate crisis, born into an era of awareness of global North South,
3221360	3225600	Black Lives Matter and born into a much critical, much more critical awareness of the inequities
3225600	3230640	thrown up by the systems we've created. They are looking for these tools that will help them
3230640	3234800	transform the future and at the very least steer through the future that they know crisis is coming
3234800	3240720	and we need resilience. So yes, let's spread these ideas, you know, through podcast and through
3240720	3245920	online courses to make them available as possible. I get no greater thrill than when a teacher writes
3245920	3249840	to me on Twitter and says, I'm using these ideas and I'm teaching them in my class and it's like,
3249840	3256560	go, let's go. This is big team work. And we create a big team when we share and feedback and that
3256560	3260080	lovely feeling of, I mean, I'm part of a really big team and I don't even know the names of all
3260080	3264640	my teammates, but we're doing this together. Well, you're part of the right team. That's even more
3264640	3272000	important on behalf of nature and the future. If I can help you in any way on that, obviously,
3272000	3276880	we're doing this podcast, but let's continue talking offline because I think what you're
3276880	3285600	doing is so important. You just mentioned inequalities. I know that wealth inequality is
3285600	3294160	something that you often talk about. It seems that income and wealth inequality are incompatible with
3294800	3301440	what you envision to be a successful doughnut economy. Do you think that ecologically and
3301440	3309040	biophysically responsible societies need to go hand in hand with more materially equitable
3309040	3316800	societies? Yes, definitely. I mean, here's the doughnut. Here's the overshooting and shortfall
3316800	3320160	doughnut. So all the red in the middle is the extent to which people worldwide are falling
3320160	3324240	short on essential needs and the outside is the extent to which we're overshooting planetary
3324240	3329600	boundaries. Actually, it's been updated and the 2022 data would show even more red here. We're
3329600	3336880	overshooting even more. So the scale of inequality in the world is just gobsmacking.
3337760	3342960	The richest 1% of people own half of the world's wealth. I can't actually, in my head,
3343520	3352240	hold that as the scale of inequalities that has. There's no way we can meet the needs of all people
3352240	3359040	within the means of planetary boundaries in such an inequality because we need a massive redistribution
3359040	3365280	of resources and access to resource for all these people who literally don't have food,
3365280	3371440	health, education, housing, transport. We need to see the most economic growth and the most
3371440	3375600	well-being growth in the lowest income countries. That's where I absolutely believe that economies,
3375600	3380560	if we measure them in traditional way, GDP, they will grow. Malawi people there live on
3380560	3386160	an average $1,500 per person per year, massive human shortfall. We need to see that growth.
3387360	3392720	And the only way that that's going to be possible with the planetary limits is for those who have
3392720	3397440	very large material footprints now, which are very heavily coupled with high incomes,
3398320	3403280	to come back with influential boundaries. So creating a far more equitable world globally
3403280	3409280	and also within nations is an essential part of making it even feasible to think about coming
3409280	3413520	with influential boundaries. So yes, they have to be brought together. And many people I know
3413520	3418960	when they talk about the concept of a regenerative economy would say, well, a far more equitably
3418960	3426880	distributed economy is part of that. A regenerative system cannot thrive and continue if it's deeply
3426880	3432240	unequal. And I would agree. The reason I, in my book, and in these seven principles, I pulled
3432240	3437920	them out. I said, I want to just distinguish between or highlight that as well as from degenerative
3437920	3444240	to regenerative, from divisive to distributive, because I came working at Oxfam for a decade.
3444240	3449280	I came very much from a social justice background. And it's really important that the redistributional
3449280	3455280	intention or the predistributional intention is very, very clear. And I think sometimes when
3455760	3459600	some people hear regenerative and they think, oh, that's just environmental or just ecological,
3459600	3464320	it's really important to say, hang on, we're rebalancing both the ecological imbalances and
3464320	3470080	the social imbalances, and they have to happen together. So yes, crucial. And then it goes back
3470080	3476240	to that lovely phrase from George Monbiot, public luxury, it's accessible to all and
3476240	3481680	private sufficiency. That is very much a redistributional agenda that would achieve that.
3482320	3489680	I think we evolved with material equality because we didn't have any energy surplus. And now this
3489680	3499600	energy carbon pulse has created this just series of multiple scale power laws. Let me ask you this.
3502560	3511040	Do we need to change the prices and the cultural aspirations before such a wealth transfer would
3511040	3519920	take place? Because if we keep the same GDP as our goal, prices are at the cost of extraction,
3519920	3526640	not their real value, and we do a simultaneous wealth transfer within countries and between
3526640	3534560	countries to the global south, wouldn't that in itself actually accelerate some of the exceedings
3534560	3540800	of the planetary boundaries? So I think instead of thinking in terms of prices, I was thinking in
3540800	3546960	terms of the actual, that's why I prefer to think in terms of the regulation of saying we are going
3546960	3553520	to eliminate the use of fossil fuels here, whether it's the car or transforming, insulating our homes
3553520	3560640	and moving away from fossil fuel to renewable energy, so that we just bring down that intensive
3560720	3566160	use of fossil fuels and make available the remaining carbon budget to other countries that
3566880	3573920	have massively underused theirs. So let me ask a follow-up question there.
3575920	3582640	There's a lot of built infrastructure and momentum and sunk cost in the global north.
3583600	3594480	Is it possibly more likely that a culture, a community, a region to truly live like
3594480	3605600	donut economics, minimum human needs and don't exceed planetary boundaries in the global south,
3605600	3612880	in areas that don't have all this infrastructure and sunk cost of expectations and institutions?
3612880	3620400	Would it be easier to start this in Kenya or somewhere? I'm just asking.
3621200	3627680	Yeah, so, and I think it's a really, really valid question. I think there are two things
3627680	3632960	pulling in different directions. There is not the sunk cost, there's not the sunk infrastructural
3633040	3639600	structure that's been put in place. You haven't got the intensive road-based culture that, say,
3639600	3645680	North America has been locked into. In the same way that they've jumped from, you know,
3645680	3651440	no phones to mobile phones, from no banking to e-banking, they've jumped all those institutions
3651440	3656880	in between. So yes, when there's no infrastructural in place, you can jump to a far better solution
3656880	3663360	and that must be why there's the global north and the world makes available resources to invest
3663360	3667440	in renewable energy so they jump into renewable energy solutions. So on the one hand, you've got
3667440	3673440	the lack of inherited infrastructure as a barrier. But of course, the other side of is it,
3673440	3678720	high income countries have so much wealth and resources and technology and skilled people.
3678720	3685600	So they've got the accumulation of wealth in resources that they can either convert or they
3685600	3690800	can use that skill and the institutional structures that enable that to happen. So the idea of saying,
3690800	3697200	you know, oh, this is much easier for Kenya or Malawi, they're on incredibly low incomes and
3697200	3701120	it would only be easier if we have the transfers that need to happen from the global north to the
3701120	3707200	global south due to historic responsibilities for climate and other ecological resource use
3707200	3712400	that should be happening. I mean, I think of countries in kind of three clusters
3713280	3716480	heading towards the donut, there are the low income countries that like the ones we've just
3716480	3720320	been mentioning that need to meet the needs of all people for the first time without overshooting
3720320	3724000	planetary boundaries in the way that countries before them have done. And that's never been done
3724000	3730240	before. There's the middle income nations like China and Iran and Mexico and Russia that need to
3730240	3734080	meet people's needs for the first time while already coming back within planetary boundaries.
3734080	3738560	That's never been done before either. And then there's the high income nations that are in massive,
3738560	3742960	all high income nations are overshooting planetary boundaries. If I showed you their
3742960	3749040	national donuts, they're like big red overshoot. So first of all, next time you catch or I catch
3749040	3755200	anybody here or find ourselves saying developed countries, advanced nations like, hang on,
3755200	3758320	what are you talking about? Because there's absolutely nothing advanced or developed about
3758320	3762480	overshooting planetary boundaries. So we should be reframing our language. But these nations need to
3763280	3766960	reduce and come back within planetary boundaries, not just on carbon, big one,
3766960	3773280	but also on water use, land use, material use, all of those planetary boundaries calming back
3773280	3776800	within while finally meeting people's needs for the first time, which they definitely have the
3776800	3782160	resources to do. And that is an unprecedented pathway too. So every nation is on a pathway of
3782160	3787120	transformation. None of it's been done before. Some have the advantage of wealth. Some have
3787120	3792080	the advantage of not being locked in to existing infrastructure and some I think many of the emerging
3792080	3797520	economies, they're in the middle of those big infrastructural investments. And this is the
3797520	3802320	critical time to get it right. And of course, I think one of the dangers is the fossil fuel industry
3803680	3807280	when they find themselves being closed in the global north, the real risk is that they then
3807280	3812560	go and sell their wares to the lower income countries to get them locked in. And how do we
3812560	3818080	avoid them getting that lock in instead moving to the renewable energy future that will actually
3818080	3822000	power them and enable them not to get locked into endless growth. They need to grow now,
3822000	3825360	but not get locked into institutions that drive them to endlessly.
3826640	3833600	So what is the correct term developed world that's creating global ecocide or the global north? I mean,
3833600	3836240	what is the acceptable term? Do you come up with something?
3836240	3840880	Yeah, I use just very factual language of high income, middle income and low income,
3840880	3846560	because I'm just describing their income levels. But I think we really need new language because
3846560	3849760	the more that we find ourselves saying, you know, even if people say, well, developed nations,
3849760	3854640	but you know what I mean by that, it still just keeps creating this idea that that's the aspiration
3854640	3860320	and others should get there. And I find it very powerful when I show national donut diagrams
3860880	3865520	to countries like Norway, you mentioned Norway, but people are whole Norway up in Norway, wonderful
3865520	3869360	life, high income, great quality of air, and you can swim in the harbor, what's not to like.
3870000	3875520	Norway has a massive ecological overshoot like all high income nations. And when you show them,
3876400	3880800	these images, and that high income countries are very far from living the donut Costa Rica is much
3880800	3885200	closer than any other nation. There's a real jaw drop moment, actually. And I've seen it visibly
3885200	3889840	on the face of officials of nations who who used to being considered the top of the ranking. And
3889840	3894880	actually, it really repositions. And there's a humility that kicks in that there's that uh-huh,
3894880	3901600	or maybe it's an oh dear, or gosh, look at us moment, that we need of humility and ambition of we too
3901600	3908560	need to deeply transform. And last century's economic theories were not designed to solve this.
3908560	3913360	So we really shouldn't be expecting them to deliver on this. We need new theories, new textbooks,
3913360	3919360	new courses, new ideas, new policies to get us there. I just saw a graph this morning, which is
3919360	3926000	another sort of aha that Norway is probably the most successful nation in the world on scaling
3926080	3934560	electric vehicles. But their oil use is going up. So the addition of electric vehicles replacing
3934560	3939280	internal combustion vehicles has not reduced their their oil consumption.
3939840	3943200	Is it the domestic oil consumption? Because I know they're massive oil
3943200	3946720	producer and selling oil to others, but even domestic oil consumption?
3946720	3951920	The domestic consumption. Yeah, I'll send you the chart. So here's a question, Kate.
3952320	3963440	Um, and this gets to the competition versus cooperation, uh, game theory dynamics of the
3963440	3975440	world. But if a country or a city or a region chose to let let's we're going to live in the
3975440	3985680	donut, we're going to follow this from an energy surplus, power, money, potential,
3987120	3992960	optionality on doing things in the world, they will be temporarily at least outcompeted
3993520	3998080	by those nations that continue to maximize profits because those profits can be spent
3998720	4008400	on things that either militarily or technologically will cause that that first few nations or
4008400	4013600	communities to be outcompeted, not in the long run, because in the long run, it's a tortoise and
4013600	4018160	hare sort of thing. And the tortoise we know ends up winning the race. But in the short run,
4018160	4028400	they'll be outcompeted. Isn't that an inherent like, uh, blockage to wide scale, um, adherence of
4028400	4031920	of these ideas? What do you think about that? Yeah, really important point. So let me start
4031920	4038560	at the level of the city. When cities actually start aiming to do this, I think they actually,
4038560	4042720	they might not have, you know, grow, grow, grow the city. And many city policymakers say,
4043280	4047200	that's not our goal. That's not what we judge a success for our city to get bigger,
4047200	4050720	to bring in more and more big companies to expand, have more and more housing.
4052000	4057360	People are creating cities that are great places to live where you can move quickly, where the
4057360	4061120	air is clean, where there are good schools for kids, where there's nature,
4062000	4067440	where you feel you won't be hit by a heat wave in the summer. These, these are all qualities of
4067440	4072560	living in the doughnut, where there's a strong community, there's public luxury. This brings
4072560	4077520	people in. I mean, these city connoble is an example. People are moving to connoble. It's
4077520	4083440	seen as a, actually that's a really desirable place to live. So the city scale, I think actually
4083440	4089600	it's a signal, especially for industries where people can work remotely and, and parents as
4089600	4093280	they can have their parental hat and their work hat. And I can actually be around for my kids and
4093280	4099120	I can reconnect and I want to raise kids here. It brings crowds of people in. Now when you go to
4099120	4105440	the national level. We need those bold, those bold civic leaders to go in this direction
4105440	4112240	to then act as pilots of success living this way. Yes. Yes. And I think that, and I'm not
4112240	4119040	surprised that it's cities starting. Cities are more sites of experiment and courage to, to start
4119040	4124080	moving. And I think nations are going, I'm hoping and I'm expecting nations are starting to look
4124080	4128960	at what's happening in cities and saying, actually, this is, this is the seeds of proof of concept and
4128960	4133840	can we start doing this national? But this point you just raised, I think is a really big one.
4134560	4140080	And I, when we, when we say, okay, we need to move away from growth dependency, the question becomes
4140080	4145600	how our economy is currently structurally dependent upon endless growth. And there are
4145600	4151520	at least eight ways, right? There's four financial ways companies pursue maximum returns for their
4151520	4156080	shareholders, that drives growth, commercial banks create money as interest bearing debt,
4156080	4161200	that drives growth. When, if the economy is not growing, but companies are still chasing labor
4161200	4164800	productivity, that creates unemployment. So you need growth to absorb the unemployment.
4166080	4171360	On the other side, social lock ins, right, people still after 100 years of propaganda,
4171360	4178080	thank you very much, Edward Bernays for succeeding, right? Convincing us that the way we will improve
4178160	4181040	ourselves is to buy something more. So there's that kind of consumerism.
4183200	4190000	Having a growing economy helps avoid the ultimate redistribution question. And so it avoids actually
4190000	4194880	having to tackle redistribution. But one of them really important social lock into growth, and it's
4194880	4200160	kind of geopolitical lock into growth, as you just mentioned, I look at the G20 photo that's
4200160	4204640	taken every year. And I think well, no leader wants their country to lose their place in that G20
4204640	4209520	family photo. But if one of those nations amongst them said, we're no longer going to pursue growth,
4209520	4213680	we're going to pursue a resilient national economy, well, there is, particularly in the
4213680	4218480	current atmosphere in the world, there is the geopolitical view, political military question
4218480	4225840	of geopolitical power and military power, and resilience against threats. And I think
4226800	4233040	Europe, I mean, the European countries coming together and creating a region is one very good
4233040	4238720	example of how countries, individual countries can overcome that by saying, well, we together,
4238720	4242720	we are stronger, we stand so that we don't individually all have to keep growing, we keep
4242720	4249600	no the size of us together. But I but to me, this is one of the very most challenging lock ins to
4249600	4254160	to structural dependency on growth. And I don't think the solution is an economic question. I
4254160	4258160	think it's a political international relations question. And just as much as I would love
4258800	4264400	these ideas to be taught in economics departments, I think every student studying macro economics
4264400	4268960	should absolutely be encountering a macro economics course in post growth thinking.
4269600	4274720	I think all schools of government should be introducing their students to questions of
4274720	4280960	how can we create, think about geopolitical power and power dynamics and relations and
4280960	4285520	international relations in a post growth context, because you've just pointed out one of the most
4286320	4291200	critical collective action problems we have. Why are schools of government not grappling
4291200	4295280	with this head on? I think they're too much influenced by schools of economics that again,
4295280	4299680	thanks to that one time power pulse from fossil fuels, assume that growth is the norm. And so we
4299680	4304320	do international relations in the context of assuming growth is the norm for all nations. I
4304320	4311040	think it's time to move on. I think I on one of our one on one calls, I think I told you this story,
4311040	4317360	but in the last 10 or 15 years when I'm talking to high level government people around the world,
4319120	4327520	almost all of them were either themselves or directly flanked by a PhD in economics or finance,
4327520	4335200	like everyone. And it's like they're the gatekeeper to the politician. So it makes these things
4335600	4341600	hard. And there's like a glass ceiling of what can be discussed at those levels.
4342800	4350800	Except you were highlighted last month at a beyond growth conference, which the head of the EU
4350800	4357520	Commission president started out. That must have been a proud moment for you to highlight such an
4357520	4364960	amazing thing at the European Commission. Yes. Yes. So the group of MEPs in Europe organized
4364960	4370880	the beyond growth conference in the European Parliament. And it was opened by a Sivanda
4370880	4376960	Lyon and she it was it was impressive to see her there. I say it was really important to see her
4376960	4382400	there. And to see her saying, I think she said, you know, fossil fuel based growth is in the past.
4382400	4386640	And it's got yeah, she didn't say just growth. No, she said fossil fuel based growth. Yeah.
4388000	4392480	It's still a win. Yeah. But the fact that she came to a conference and stood on a platform where
4392480	4398000	it said very large letters behind a beyond growth, that's that's very different from 10 years ago.
4398000	4402800	And it was really important that that conference happened. And many excellent post growth thinkers
4402800	4410640	across Europe, D growth, post growth, donate economics, well being economies were there and
4410640	4416160	talking about what does it mean and indeed not just Europe from around the world, really starting
4416160	4419840	to dig into what does it mean in terms of the metrics in terms of the macroeconomic policies
4419840	4424640	in terms of the labor transition in terms of business design, showing that there is a whole
4424640	4430000	other form of economic thinking emerging and ready to be taken far more seriously. So I think
4430000	4435760	it was very, very important that that happened in the European Parliament. And again, I was delighted
4435760	4440400	to be presenting the ideas of donate economics there and talking about using these metrics because
4440400	4447360	I could point to so many pretty major cities in Europe, Brussels, the city capital region of
4447360	4458320	Brussels itself, Barcelona, where am I trying to say Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Tommelila in Sweden,
4458320	4464560	and more and more, Bad Nauheim in Germany, some pretty big European cities are saying, yeah,
4464560	4471760	this we are choosing this the donut framework as our own new metric. So again, it's from the city
4471760	4477120	and regional level that it I know it brings it currency and credibility and recognition
4477120	4479920	within European Commission. And actually, there's been within the European Commission,
4479920	4485280	there's a group of civil servants within there who for the last at least three years from just
4485280	4492800	before COVID, they created a group called Donut for EU. And they within different European Commission
4492800	4497440	and European Union institutions started saying we want to bring this language. And for me, it's a win.
4498320	4500960	I don't you know, you don't need to see the diagram of the donut, you don't need to hear the word
4500960	4507600	donut whenever I hear a policymaker saying, we are aiming for well being or living well within
4508400	4512320	planetary boundaries or limits or within the means of the planet. To me, the word within
4513200	4517440	is a radical word, because you again, you're hearing it the economy within
4518160	4523360	the biosphere. So every time I hear a policymaker speak to a vision of well being within
4524480	4529760	the planet, you think, hallelujah, we are into a new paradigm with that one little word,
4530000	4537680	we're in a new space. So one of my addictions is unfortunately buying URLs that I might someday
4537680	4545440	use. And one of them I bought 10 years ago was livewithin.org. I keep renewing it. I haven't had
4545440	4550640	time. Speaking of time, how the hell do you manage all this? You were like the degrowth
4550640	4557120	energizer bunny. I mean, do you have, do you come up with all these graphical tools yourself?
4557120	4562560	Or do you have like a professional PR toolmaker? Or are these your ideas?
4562560	4565440	Are you saying did I pay somebody to make these bits of cardboard for me?
4566320	4571120	Well, no, I meant the ideas. Like I want a graphical tool.
4572560	4578080	So, okay, so when donut economics came out, the thrilling thing for me was the number of people,
4578080	4581680	as I said, who came up and said, love the ideas, and I want to do this. I'm a town counselor,
4581680	4588080	I'm a teacher, I'm a startup founder, I'm a community organizer. So that's why I set up
4588080	4594640	together with a team, donut economics action lab. We are a remote team. There are 12 of us
4595440	4600800	working across different countries. And together we are creating these tools. So
4601600	4606400	we knew right from the beginning that cities would say, what would it mean to do the donut city?
4606400	4610400	So we created a tool, came up with a kind of conceptual framework that we make as a canvas,
4610960	4614560	meaning it's something you can put on the table. You can literally, you know, put things on it,
4614560	4623360	make it very visual, very tactile, very unknown, no equations in sight. We don't need equations for
4623360	4629280	this. It's a worldview reframing activity. And we do it in person. And you can do it online. So
4629280	4632960	everything we do, because we're a remote organization, it really helps us think remotely. And we
4632960	4636960	make all of our tools available on Miro and online, so that we can run web, for example,
4636960	4640880	the government of Bhutan got in touch. And they said, you know what, the concept of gross
4640880	4645200	national happiness, which guides us, it's actually got a lot in common with the donut. We want to
4645200	4650160	see what happens when we work together with the two concepts. And we ran some webinars for 100
4650880	4656960	civil servants of Bhutan online to share these tools with them. So I'm working with a team of
4656960	4661760	12 people. And I have to say one of the best things for me going from working alone when my book came
4661760	4665760	out. And all, you know, the interest that was coming, it was almost bouncing off me because
4665760	4670400	there was nothing I personally could do with it. But now there's a team. I say, you're a mayor and
4670400	4673440	you don't want to talk about cities. Let me introduce you to my colleague, Leonora. She's
4673440	4677200	our city's lead. You want to talk about business? You want to talk to Eric Sahan. You want to talk
4677200	4682320	about communities? Meet Rob. Talk about education. Meet Carolina. We've got this wonderful team of
4682320	4686880	people who are running with each of these and bringing practitioners together in a community
4686880	4692720	and conversation of peer learning groups. So it's a thrill for me in setting up an organization and
4692720	4698960	a team with my co-founder Carlotta Sand setting up this team to say, how can we make this work
4698960	4703200	distributive? Just like this ball, right? At the beginning, it was all coming at me. And this is
4703200	4708080	just like, I can't cope with all this. But let's distribute it across our team, but also across
4708080	4714560	the community. Of course, I'm working too hard and running too much, like many, many people and
4714560	4721600	personally, you think this is at risk of running me down and the times are urgent and the crisis
4721600	4727520	is now. And because of the crises that are hitting in the world, more and more people are suddenly
4727520	4731920	waking up and looking around for those ideas that are lying around. So how do we make sure that
4731920	4738240	they're really visible, really accessible? And yes, these are very serious issues, but how can we
4738240	4742240	make them irresistible? Because the last thing you want is people to say, you know what, this is
4742240	4747120	too complex, too overwhelming. I find it depressing and overwhelming. I'm just going to switch off
4747120	4753120	from it. I want people to say, that looks energizing, inspiring. I want to be part of it.
4753120	4757680	And then to lean in. And that's why I aim to make it playful. Well, actually, I just also like having
4757680	4761840	fun. Hell, let's have fun while we're on this team, right? It's got to be the most fun place to work.
4761840	4767280	It's got to be the funnest project to do, rather than just extracting from the world. Let's repair
4767280	4771040	the world and have fun while we do it. So it's the team at Donut Economics Action App and the
4771040	4776800	community of over 10,000 people who've joined our website and our platform. And it's just, I get
4776880	4781360	energy from every time somebody comes and says, oh, yeah, I'm using this in my town. I'm teaching
4781360	4786400	this in my classroom. I've used this in my class. It's just amazingly energizing because we can see
4786400	4791360	all the challenges in the world. And yet time and time again, you see people, the opposite is
4791360	4796080	happening. And it's not publicly visible all the time, but it's rising, it's bubbling, it's rising.
4796080	4799920	And I'm just going to lean all my energy I have into helping keep that rising.
4800000	4807280	Well, congratulations. With just 12 people, you are punching way above your weight on the impact
4807280	4816960	of sharing these stories with other people. By the way, last week I was traveling and I saw signs
4816960	4822560	there is already a national doughnut day, which in the United States people actually just eat
4822560	4827680	doughnuts. So I'm very happy there will be an international doughnut day with our planetary
4827680	4835440	boundaries. One final question before I get to the closing questions. So you were at this
4835440	4840960	Beyond Growth Conference. You and I have talked about this before. I often state that degrowth
4840960	4847840	is what we should do because of global inequality and because of resource and climate limits.
4848400	4855200	But the metabolism of the system won't allow that. So we will hit a wall and then
4855920	4861360	bend, hopefully not break. So degrowth is what we should do, but post growth is what we're going
4861360	4868800	to have to do. So the way I see it is there's two tasks here. One is to describe and flesh out
4868800	4874880	and advocate for what a sustainable, desirable society might look like with the governance and
4874880	4880320	the commons and the care economy and everything you've stated. And then how do we get from here
4880400	4886560	to there, which is a related but distinctly separate question. Do you have any thoughts on
4887200	4895440	that dichotomy? So definitely spelling out the vision of where we want to get to. And I really
4895440	4898400	appreciated that you said that earlier on. I said, you know, it's easier said than done. You said,
4898400	4904320	yeah, but it's really important to say it so we have a vision of it. And that is where I've placed
4904320	4910160	my energy. And, you know, again, in this big teamwork, that's the role I focused on playing of
4911200	4916560	how can the donor acts as a vision of where we want to get to. And it's an aspirational positive
4916560	4921920	vision. And then setting out some of the fundamental diagrams and the principles that would be part of
4921920	4926960	an economy that's got there. And then there's a question of, okay, if we do keep going, if we fail
4926960	4933360	to turn and keep accelerating at the wall, will we bend or break? I would say that I think the
4933360	4938640	degrowth community, as I understand it, they would say, when you say, can we bend, not break?
4938640	4943920	I mean, they would say, degrowth is the aim to bend. That's what people in the degrowth community
4943920	4950000	mean by a just reduction of consumption and production of less necessary things to come back
4950000	4954560	within planetary boundaries in a democratic way. That that is a beautiful vision of a bend.
4955120	4960080	But I hear you're saying, well, if we don't bend in time, then we're going to hit
4961040	4965760	crises. And it's going to be through shocks and through subsystems collapsing, that we're going
4965760	4972400	to be forced into a post growth future. Just one reflection I'll have on that. And I'm not saying
4973200	4978640	having set out how to get there. I do think we need a positive vision of what we're still aiming
4978640	4983920	for. I think really key to that is looking at going back to one of the structural dependencies
4983920	4989760	on growth and how do we remove them? Doing that work now gives us the best chance
4989760	4995040	to survive an era in which growth doesn't come. And that's why I think it's really an ethical
4995040	5000240	obligation on economists to look at this, you know, the radical uncertainty of the future
5000800	5007360	and the existential challenges of what happens if the growth based thinking gets it wrong,
5007360	5010720	I think puts a huge ethical obligation on looking at alternative futures.
5011120	5017120	But if I come back and think, well, what if we find out that we're going to, you know, if we
5017120	5023680	break, we don't bend well, we will find we're actually spending much of the century continually
5023680	5028800	outside of planetary boundaries and people falling short. And the more that we stay out here,
5028800	5031760	the more that these crises are going to hit, the more the shocks are going to hit us.
5032320	5034960	And the first time I asked myself, okay, what if it turns out that
5035840	5041440	much of the 21st century is going to be lived outside of these boundaries and continue to be so,
5041440	5047760	does that change the goal? I still, it didn't make me move away fundamentally from saying that the
5047760	5054560	goal is still to come back to the donor. The goal still to be as resilient as we can is to
5054560	5060320	create systems that provision essentially for people's needs and do everything we can to combat,
5060400	5066400	you know, every inch here matters. Every inch matters the closer we come to coming back within
5066400	5073760	those boundaries. So it didn't dislodge for me the value of this way of thinking. And I would
5073760	5078320	love it to be dislodged. And I can I just add a comment here, which is the donut may have come
5078320	5084080	after, you know, kind of our common future, the Brentland Commission and that definition of
5084080	5088720	sustainability. And then we get footprints in the long comes the donut. And I'm very aware it
5088720	5094480	stands in a line of thinking. And, and whenever I teach it, I always say to students, and then what
5094480	5099680	next? This is a, it's not a fight. It's not an endpoint. It's a, it's a point a long away. Our
5099680	5103760	thinking is evolving. More people are coming saying, I want to create something more biocentric,
5104560	5109440	more nature centered. What would that look like? So I look forward also to the day that the donut
5109440	5113840	framework has been superseded, because we've moved beyond it, because there's a generation
5113840	5118560	rising who instead of seeing the donut, wow, I've been waiting my whole life to see that,
5118560	5122880	like a 50 year old might say that, yes, I've always thought like this, 20 year old, you show them
5122880	5128240	the donut and they go, yeah, yeah, I get it. Come on. And go further. They're born into that
5128240	5132640	expectation. It's quite thrilling to see that. What are they going to create? What's coming next?
5134000	5139760	Well, you've, you've done such important work on the Overton window of just thinking about
5139840	5145760	how a new economy might be. I almost think that, and we've talked about this before, that
5147200	5152000	I'm trying to work on something called advanced policy, which is those things we're going to
5152000	5158720	need to do in the future that are politically and socially too strange and forward to be
5158720	5165920	accepted today. But if there was like a donut break glass in case of emergency blueprint that
5165920	5174560	all governments, you know, city, county, national had like a rule of principles and then what to do
5175520	5180800	once we're in this situation, but based on some of the core seven things that you laid out,
5180800	5186800	I think that might be kind of interesting. I like that. Yeah, yeah. Because I think at the,
5187680	5191120	first rule is please break the glass now and use the donut now. Don't leave it.
5191840	5194880	Don't leave it sitting in the cabinet until the crisis hits, right?
5194880	5200720	Well, at its core, and you mentioned Eleanor Ostrom a couple times, at its core, I think we
5200720	5209040	face a crisis of governance because our governments were not created or the institutions for this
5209040	5215440	sort of a world and we're just stuck in our ways looking at old forms of governance and
5215520	5224000	institutional thinking. So I mean, I think education is the first central point and this is great.
5226560	5232400	So I have some closing questions, Kate, that I ask all my guests if you have a few more minutes.
5233520	5240000	So more broadly beyond your books, your teaching and the Donut Economics Action Lab,
5240560	5246080	you've thought about since the 90s when you had your aha moment and you left the dark side as it
5246080	5252800	were these issues as a career choice. Do you have any advice just to the listeners or watchers of
5252800	5265920	this program at this time of global poly crisis? If you are embedded in a worldview that sees growth
5265920	5275600	as the goal, really deeply ask yourself a question that and move to, okay, my biggest piece of advice
5275600	5282880	is to tap into what we deeply know in our own bodies, right? In our own bodies, we know that health
5282880	5288080	doesn't lie in growth. I mean, when kids are small, yeah, that's a great sign of health. And then
5288080	5293840	there comes a point where you don't want them to grow anymore. It comes to thriving and health lies
5293840	5299200	in balance in our bodies. We really get that I need enough food and not too much. I need enough
5299200	5306400	temperature and warmth and not too much. I need enough water, oxygen, stress on my body, enough
5306400	5312240	and not too much salt, whatever you want to add, that my bodily health lies in balance. And if
5312240	5318160	something inside my body tries to grow unstoppably, we call that cancer and we move in and we stop it
5318160	5323040	as soon as we can. We deeply understand that and each one of our own bodies is a complex adaptive
5323040	5332480	system. So each one of us is a miniature living ecosystem planetary experiment. If we can take
5332480	5339280	therefore what we deeply know, not just metaphorically, but really deeply from the human body to the
5339280	5344320	planetary body and say what makes sense for human health, makes sense for planetary health,
5344320	5351200	and how then do I live when I tap into that thinking? And how do I eat and travel and
5351280	5357840	invest and divest and protest and volunteer? And how do I protect the health of my body
5357840	5362000	as part of the health of the whole planet back to how does the parent look off their child
5362000	5366400	by looking off the world? It's deeply interconnected. That I think when we tap into that we give
5366400	5370960	ourselves the best metaphorical opportunity to understand the much greater living system of
5370960	5382080	which we are part. Sobriety and lagom. Yes. So how would you change that advice to a young
5382080	5388480	human 17, 18, 19 year olds who are sitting in your Oxford class? Do you change your recommendations
5388480	5393920	for a young person? Well, so these these many of these young people, as I said, they grew up
5393920	5400640	climate striking. Their teenage years were spent marching for a stable climate. They've come from
5400640	5408160	a very different place. And I would say to them have the courage of your age. And I mean your youth.
5408800	5413280	You know, I've been in places where a young person came up to me after a talk and she said,
5413280	5418160	I really wanted to ask a question, but I'm only 17. And I said, wait, you should have put up your
5418160	5424800	hand and say, I am 17. And this is my question because actually your youth is part of your
5424800	5429840	power and your saliency in this room and your presence and your long term view to which we all
5429920	5436720	owe you a long term answer. So hold on to that clarity of the demands of youth and carry it
5436720	5442640	through into the classroom and question why you're being taught models that smell deeply dated to you.
5443440	5447840	Because the biggest change that I've seen coming through, like we're saying in academic economics,
5447840	5454880	was when the students demanded it's coming from below, it's coming up and believe that systems
5454880	5458800	get transformed, you know, find out about the history of the civil rights movement and
5459520	5463440	Gandhi and the decolonization movement and the suffragettes and the women's rights movements
5463440	5468160	and always remember that it's been the rebels and the disruptors who were so deeply inconvenient at
5468160	5474480	the time and often maligned. They are now celebrated on the classroom walls as the heroes of the age.
5474480	5483360	And so those who protest and disrupt and disturb the system, you are doing key work of transforming
5483440	5488720	this. And I would say those young people get involved because we know, you know, psychologists
5488720	5494320	tell us and people feel, if the people feel an anxiety or a stress of the context, it's when
5494320	5498000	you get involved and you start actually channeling your energy into being part of it and working with
5498000	5502960	others and collaborating with others who think like you, that you feel energized and empowered
5502960	5508560	in this situation rather than depressed and overwhelmed in the same situation. The situation
5508560	5512800	around us is the same. How do we change it by changing how we engage with it?
5514160	5520720	Well, I feel energized and inspired whenever you and I talk. So I agree with you that finding
5520720	5526800	like-minded people that share your ideals and visions of the future is one of the biggest
5526800	5530800	pieces of advice I give to young people. And there's a 17-year-old in all of us, isn't there?
5531040	5541920	For sure. But I can't imagine being 17 today. I was just a complete child when I was 17 relative
5541920	5548720	to the 17-year-olds that were my students learning about ecology and complex adaptive systems.
5550160	5553360	You know, the world is caught up to this story, Kate.
5554080	5561120	Can I just say then, when COVID lockdown happened, my kids were 11, my teenagers, and
5563040	5566560	we had to homeschool them. So I was like, oh, homeschooling. I thought, well, I know what I'm
5566560	5570080	going to homeschool them first. I'm going to teach them system thinking. Because I had once
5570080	5575520	argued, I'd presented the seven ways to think like a 21st century economist with a very mainstream
5575520	5581120	professor, economics professor in the Netherlands. And he said, system thinking is far too difficult
5581120	5585840	for undergraduates to understand. So I thought, OK, let's take this on. So I taught it to my
5585840	5590480	11-year-olds. We sat down with a big white board. I drew some, here's a reinforcing feedback. Here's
5590480	5595120	a balancing feedback. And we drew some basic feedback loops about COVID. And then I just
5595120	5601200	handed over the pens and they went wild with it. And they drew from people playing the guitar in
5601200	5605200	the back garden to pressure on nurses, to pressure and accountability of the government.
5605200	5609440	And they just brought everything in. But my daughter, she was jumping up and down with
5609440	5614800	excitement. She's like, now I can express what I want to say. You know, born systems thinkers,
5614800	5620080	now we've given you the tools and language. You can, because you could see these feedback loops
5620080	5628800	in the world. So it's also an incredibly exciting time to be educated if you're equipped with some
5628800	5633760	of the ideas that are going to actually help us go forward. That's why I just, I find it exciting.
5633760	5637440	Hand over these tools to young people. Now, what are they going to see? What are they going to do?
5638000	5644720	What will they envision that we can't see? Because we're, you know, I'm 52. There are so
5644720	5649040	many possibilities that I just can't see. So I love that feeling of the generational handover
5649040	5655120	as well. Let's see what the next generation do with this. I think we, as a culture, massively
5655120	5661840	underestimate teenagers. And I really loved teaching 18 and 19 year olds, Reality 101.
5661840	5668160	But I actually think it has to start earlier, 12, 13, 14, 15 on these things. Because this is a
5668160	5675120	huge resource. That's just being taught outdated trivia relative to what the world's going to need.
5677040	5682000	So what do you care, a personal question, what do you care most about in the world, Kate?
5683200	5689040	So I am deeply inspired by Janine Benius, the bio-memory thinker. She's one of my heroes. And
5689360	5698160	it's, you hear Janine talk about life, life's capacity to create conditions conducive to life.
5699520	5706400	That fills me with awe. I'm not a religious person, but if I'm filled with awe of a miracle,
5706400	5716080	of a marvel, it is the regenerative capacities of life on this planet. And the systems that
5716800	5723280	keep reproducing conditions conducive to life. That is what I care about most as a living being
5723280	5727840	on this planet. And that's why I care about economics, the art of household management,
5727840	5735200	being in service to planetary household and creating an economy that is in service to
5735200	5737840	continuing to produce conditions conducive to life.
5738400	5743840	Other than when we first said hello, the biggest moment of joy in the last three hours for me was
5743840	5750320	I saw a red fox across the road from me on my bike ride this morning. And yeah, the planet is
5750320	5756640	an amazing thing. Even in its depleted state on the biosphere relative to a century ago,
5756640	5763040	it is still a wonderful, amazing place, the only place in the known universe to harbor life,
5763040	5771840	let alone complex life. So last couple of questions, what specific issue are you most
5771920	5774800	concerned about in the coming 10 years or so in the world?
5778000	5785520	I'm going to say, well, two things. One, we know more crises are coming. We know more ecological
5785520	5791840	impacts. We know more food price crisis will come when for harvests fail, when there are floods.
5792640	5797760	One of my big concerns is how, coming back to the point of governance, how will we govern
5797760	5803440	ourselves in those moments? How will we respond? Will we revert to ration economic man and hoard,
5804000	5810720	and will powers extract as much as they can? This is a great moment to make your 15% folks.
5811760	5816640	Will we respond like that? Or will we move towards Eleanor Ostrom's description of the
5816640	5820800	Commons where we actually recognize that if any of us are going to get through it, because we're
5820800	5825120	all going to aim to get through it, and we're going to collaborate. So to me, it's that concern of
5825680	5831520	what is the groundwork that we put in now so that as those crises hit nations, will they shut
5831520	5834720	their borders or will they collaborate? What happens over COVID vaccine? What happens during
5834720	5839680	food price crisis? How do nations respond to one another? That's the concern. And then the really
5839680	5846320	bigger, longer-term question of a deeper understanding. Well, for me, it's finance. I
5846320	5851520	really, I still haven't done it. So I want more conversations with you. How do we take finance
5851520	5858080	that was designed to endlessly accumulate? That's what financial capital has got into its
5858080	5863680	current DNA. How do you repurpose that utterly human-created design? It's a human construct.
5863680	5872400	How do we redesign that? So it's compatible with life on a planet that aims to continually
5872400	5877760	produce conditions conducive to life. That's my, so it's not my, that's not my worry. That's
5877760	5882080	my big curiosity. That's the, that's the next step of this that I want to much more deeply
5882080	5887600	understand. Because until we redesign finance, not just tweak it, not just tweak it, but really
5887600	5893920	redesign finance, we are not going to be creating systems, economic systems that actually belong
5893920	5903360	on this planet. I agree. And I have ideas to be continued on that. So if you could wave a magic
5903440	5908400	wand and there was no personal recourse to your decision, what is one thing you would do to
5908400	5921040	improve human and planetary futures? Magic wand. I would wave a wand that would help every person
5921040	5930640	on the, I mean, every person on the planet would realize, feel, recognize that we human beings
5931520	5939920	are an utterly interdependent and dependent part of the web of life. If we got that, if we really
5939920	5950240	got that and understood our dependence upon the whole earth's living systems, that to me is the
5950240	5954560	deepest change that would then follow through. I mean, of course, you're going to run into the
5954560	5959920	design or institutions and that, but if we all deeply got that, and the next generation rising
5959920	5968000	has that, to me, that's the best, the best implant that we can put into our hearts and minds
5968000	5975120	that would help us redesign systems so that we actually belong again on planet earth, that one.
5975120	5980480	You're not the first person to suggest that we need a change in consciousness with a large amount
5980480	5987600	of people in order to get to these change in aspirations and, and the doughnut. And it is
5987680	5994800	happening, I think. It's happening slowly. But I'm amazed versus two years ago how many people
5994800	6004560	are expressing these ideas, perhaps in no small part to your work. Awesome. So this was our first
6004560	6011120	public conversation. I know your work. If you were to come back in the future for round two,
6011840	6018160	is there one particular topic that you are passionate about that's relevant to our futures
6018160	6024560	that you would like to take a deep dive on? Any ideas? It's going to be finance. I'm going to
6024560	6034080	be asking questions. Deep dive into, okay, how does this even begin to look? What is the structural
6034080	6040960	design of finance? I mean, I always ask, well, I often say, isn't it weird that a squirrel gathers
6040960	6044720	nuts in the autumn and buries them? When the squirrel comes back in January, it doesn't expect to find
6044720	6050960	15% more nuts, right? So why do we expect to put money into something and expect to come back and
6050960	6057600	get you 15%? So how could we redesign finance? What are the lock-ins to the current financial
6057600	6062160	system we have? Is it possible for a new financial system to emerge alongside the existing one?
6062160	6066320	What would have to change in people's own aspirations and sobriety and largom
6066320	6071920	to put their finance in something? What would be the offer? All of that.
6073600	6078800	I have started a new thing you might not know of, but once a month we have a reality round table
6078800	6085600	with three or four former guests on a topic. Maybe to have you and Steve Keane and Josh Farley
6085600	6091680	or John Erickson to talk about this question would be really good. That'd be great. I'm in.
6092640	6098800	Thank you so much for your time and all your work and to be continued, my friend.
6098800	6102960	And thank you, Nate, for this podcast because you're bringing so many voices together in
6102960	6107200	one place that I know it's a hugely valuable resource for many, many people. So thank you
6107200	6112240	for this hosting, very generously hosting other people's ideas. I really salute you for that.
