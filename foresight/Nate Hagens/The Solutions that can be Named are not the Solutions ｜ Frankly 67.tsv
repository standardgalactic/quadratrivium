0	7000	That's a very polite way to say greetings in Chinese.
7000	17000	You know, it would be great as an aside to have someone from China on the show to discuss
17000	23000	the metacrisis and how China is thinking about and facing some of these things.
23000	29000	So last week I had a frankly called the reality party.
29000	34000	It was really my frustration looking at both parties in the United States,
34000	38000	and I'm sure it's similar elsewhere in the world,
38000	45000	not really talking about the core issues that we're going to be facing in the coming decade.
45000	50000	And some of the feedback I got is what would a reality party stand for?
50000	54000	What would be the solutions to the human predicament?
54000	58000	What would be the policies that we would put forward?
58000	65000	And today I want to talk about that and talk about specifically why I am not
65000	72000	promoting certain solutions to what we face, at least not yet.
72000	76000	And that is going to be the subject of today's frankly.
89000	93000	Okay, so brief recap, the human predicament.
93000	101000	We are supported by ancient sunlight and treating it as if it were interest.
101000	108000	We currently have a 19-some terawatt global human metabolism,
108000	116000	which is around 190 billion light bulbs worth of energy turned on 24-7.
116000	122000	That is impacting the biosphere and its waste absorption capacity.
122000	128000	We're overlaying this with monetary claims that continue to grow.
128000	130000	We're in ecological overshoot.
130000	134000	Climate change is just one of many risks to the environment,
134000	140000	including novel entities and plastic and PFAS and species loss, et cetera.
140000	145000	It's my belief and my 20 years of research has led me to believe that
145000	152000	from 19 terawatts, we will hit 15 terawatts before we hit 25 terawatts.
152000	160000	And we have a lot of things to do between now and then to make the future
160000	163000	better than the default.
163000	167000	On top of all that is the evolved human behavioral constraints
167000	172000	and predilections of modern Homo sapiens.
172000	176000	So with that as the general problem statement,
176000	182000	and there's 200 hours of content on this site that unpacks the statements I just made,
182000	186000	with that as a general problem statement, what are the solutions?
186000	188000	What are the policies?
188000	190000	What should we do?
194000	199000	So first I would, as I said last week, there are no solutions, right?
199000	202000	There are solutions to a problem.
202000	205000	What we face is a predicament.
205000	211000	And predicament, there are responses and things that would make it better than the default.
211000	218000	So I really don't like talking about solutions, but it's quite a common word.
218000	224000	How do we think about solutions mitigation to what I call the human predicament
224000	226000	or the great simplification?
226000	234000	Okay, so first of all, the responses to the great simplification are not simple.
234000	235000	They are complex.
235000	243000	So first of all, the categories of the interventions would fall into three broad areas.
243000	248000	One would be using Marvin Harris's framework, the superstructure,
248000	255000	which is the ideas and the values and the beliefs and the memes and the stories and the narratives.
255000	264000	Another category would be the structure or what Daniel Schmackenberger and I have started to refer to as the social structure,
264000	272000	which is our laws and our rules and our economic ways of transacting goals, etc.
272000	279000	And underneath that is, of course, the infrastructure, which is our energy, our systems, our buildings,
279000	285000	our environmental waste capacity, and all those things.
285000	290000	So if we talk about solutions, which of those categories are we referring to?
290000	302000	And then to put this in a two-dimensional space, those of you listening, those paying attention to the future,
302000	305000	care about different scales.
305000	307000	There's the individual scale.
307000	310000	There's the local and regional scale.
310000	313000	There's the national and global scale.
313000	318000	And then to make it three-dimensional, there's the time aspect,
318000	326000	which is the pre-crisis time, which is now to whenever there is a financial or geopolitical cascade,
326000	331000	which could be very soon or we could have a decade before that happens.
331000	344000	That moment I call the bend versus break moment is how do we stabilize the system and keep it going at a less complex, smaller scale.
344000	350000	And then the third timeline is 20 years from now, 30 years from now, 40 years from now, what are the technologies,
350000	358000	ways of living with each other and with nature, governance models, etc., for the longer term.
358000	366000	So that's kind of a three-dimensional view of how we might think about the solution space.
366000	371000	But then if we even took one of those cubes, we could extrapolate it even wider.
371000	373000	There are different sorts of people.
373000	378000	Of course, the world has 8 billion people in wildly different circumstances.
378000	385000	But even the people watching this show, they might have a lot of resources or no resources.
385000	398000	They might have a lot of social capital and friends and networks or just be by themselves in their off-the-grid home in British Columbia or something.
398000	403000	So people's circumstances, high to low.
403000	412000	Also, people might be living in a different culture that is not fully complexified.
412000	415000	There's the global north where I live near Minneapolis.
415000	417000	Things are incredibly complex.
417000	422000	But also, I gave a presentation last week to a bunch of NGO leaders in India.
422000	427000	India has not yet fully complexified, which is an advantage to them.
427000	436000	The options available to someone living in India is to kind of resist the siren song of conspicuous consumption in the global north.
436000	444000	And they have actually less degrees of freedom on the climate standpoint, but more degrees of freedom on how they organize things.
444000	451000	And lastly, in this second Rubik's Cube, is what you care about.
451000	459000	A lot of listeners to this show care about other species and Earth's ecosystems and future generations.
459000	465000	Others just care about social justice and inequality.
465000	473000	Others care about local resilience and the economy where they live.
473000	489000	So all of these things make it clear that there isn't a one-size-fits-all recommendation to people in the world or viewers of this program.
489000	497000	So one of the things that I feel strongly about and the purpose that I'm, the reason I'm doing this, this work,
497000	505000	is I think we have to avoid, have more people avoid being captured by wrong narratives that are dead ends.
505000	517000	So in the sequence of being ecology, systems and energy blind, the very first step, and it is the most important step, is to understand what's going on.
517000	526000	To understand how energy, money, technology and economic growth fit together, how we do these things to get the same neurotransmitters of our successful ancestors,
526000	530000	and how this whole system has an environmental impact.
530000	534000	That takes a lot of time, but it's very important to understand.
534000	536000	And this is politically neutral.
536000	542000	It doesn't matter who you vote for or what your value system is at this point.
542000	546000	Just to understand it is integration of science.
546000	554000	And no one including me knows all this stuff, but we're all learning and headed in that direction to understand the present.
554000	561000	Because as my former guest at Conway said, we have to understand the present to understand the future and we don't.
561000	566000	Beyond that, once we understand that's when your values come in.
566000	567000	What do you care about?
567000	568000	What do you feel?
568000	570000	What is important to you?
570000	586000	People that have followed me for 20 years or the last couple of years in this podcast know I deeply care about the natural world and the one and a half to two million known species and the up to 10 million unidentified species that have no say in our economic system.
586000	592000	And I want to chaperone them as best as possible through the bottlenecks of the 21st century.
592000	599000	I've concluded that we have to also help human systems navigate this bender break in order for that to happen.
599000	601000	So that's my value system.
601000	611000	I that comes across, I think in my podcast, but it's secondary for the work to have people understand what's going on.
611000	623000	Then downstream from understanding and caring about something is the plans and the responses and the solution set and to figure out what your strategy is.
623000	630000	And then downstream from that is engaging and executing your strategies.
630000	635000	By far the most important thing on this podcast is the understanding.
635000	648000	And I'm going to continue to say why I'm not going whole hog into the solutions, but this is one reason why.
648000	657000	Another reason why is as soon as you have a specific solution, you have narrowed your audience dramatically.
657000	666000	For instance, I've come up with and I will be articulating this later this summer, many categories of intervention interventions.
666000	669000	There's regenerative agriculture and technology.
669000	675000	There's what I call the real energy transition, which isn't transitioning to a type of energy.
675000	681000	It's a transition on how we use energy and interact with others and with with our local ecosystems.
681000	688000	There's Goldilocks technology, not too hot, not too cold, just right for a lower throughput future.
688000	690000	There's advanced policy.
690000	697000	There's a new framework for philanthropy, which I may call capital in the service of life.
697000	699000	There's different governance models.
699000	701000	There's libraries of healing.
701000	704000	These are all general categories.
704000	717000	But once you get more specific than that, what if your audience is an engineer or a teacher or a celebrity or a college student or a college professor or a philanthropist or a farmer?
717000	723000	There's different answers for each of those categories.
727000	735000	Okay, another reason I don't talk about solutions is a delicate one.
735000	743000	And I probably could say a lot more about this and I probably will already say too much.
743000	754000	Human systems, the way we have a shared mind space around the world with the 8 billion humans or at least the billions that are connected to the Internet.
754000	757000	Technology has accentuated this.
757000	764000	This mind space functions very similar to systems in nature.
764000	768000	And there are adaptive systems, adaptive processes.
768000	774000	There's a predator-prey-like relationship and things move very fast.
774000	780000	To give a natural system analog, there are bivalves, which are like mollusks and clams.
780000	787000	And the thickness of their shell is based on the predators around them that would be able to crush the shell.
787000	793000	And if there are no predators that have strong jaws in their environment, they don't need to grow thick shells.
793000	796000	Growing the thick shells is a waste of energy and resources.
796000	799000	They only do that in response to things.
799000	802000	And it's the same thing in human systems.
803000	810000	You know, Bucky Fuller famously said, you can't change the existing system by fighting it.
810000	813000	You have to create a new system that makes the old system obsolete.
813000	815000	He didn't believe that.
815000	825000	He was a military contractor that did the due lines and the Arctic for the domes to protect the ICBM nuclear missiles.
825000	827000	He was the contractor for those domes.
827000	836000	He couldn't come out and say, you know, fight the existing system because then there would have been an immediate adaptive response to that.
836000	842000	And he would have, you know, lost status and the voice that he had.
842000	845000	Countless examples like that.
845000	850000	9-11, no one knew that you could hijack planes.
850000	854000	Osama bin Laden figured it out and it was adaptive response.
854000	863000	But the response in counter to it happened really fast because I think it was the third plane on their cell phones.
863000	866000	People knew that you were, they were doing this.
866000	868000	So they no longer allowed that to happen.
868000	872000	And the passengers attacked the pilots.
872000	875000	And that's why the plane didn't hit the White House.
875000	884000	So all of the information out there is very quickly adapted to and responded to.
884000	892000	And so the real solutions to the Meta crisis will not be televised and they will not be popular either.
892000	900000	So it's, it's good to talk about the framework that we face.
900000	913000	And so people don't buy dumb narratives like net zero by 2050 with continued economic growth, but it will never be a thing that the solution set to the Meta crisis is outlined publicly.
913000	924000	You know, in a subset of that, that's not the adaptive nature of it is the universe of socially acceptable solutions.
924000	933000	And then there's a universe of effective solutions and how much that overlap is is probably not huge.
933000	944000	So and then on top of that, we've got climate change and economic growth and poverty and inequality and biodiversity and all these concentric circles.
944000	949000	There's some overlap with some of them, but there's no overlap of all of them.
949000	953000	And how do we manage for that?
955000	965000	A deeper, more tangible example of this adaptive ceiling that I mentioned.
965000	973000	I've been blessed with this podcast to come across a lot of humans who are working on fantastic things.
973000	991000	I met someone recently who is working on existing language that when a wetland gets bulldozed over for a new Walmart or something, that community has to procure a new wetland somewhere in the world.
991000	1000000	And this person is is working on the language to make that scalable in all communities in Canada and the United States.
1000000	1011000	Another person I know has individually conserved millions of acres in South America of biologically sensitive land.
1011000	1026000	These people, I want to highlight them on the podcast, not to say, hey, go do this, but to say, hey, wow, look at all these things that can be done, but they don't want to come on the podcast because if they explain what they're doing,
1026000	1033000	that creates an adaptive counter response from people that don't share their values and don't want those things to happen.
1033000	1037000	So it actually causes their special sauce to dissipate.
1037000	1047000	The one example that I have had on the show is my colleague and friend, DJ White, one of the early Green Peacers and the founder of Earth Trust.
1047000	1053000	He successfully stopped the only drive kill of dolphins in history.
1053000	1055000	It's over 30 years ago.
1055000	1071000	And I think the reason he shared why he did it and how he did it is because all the people in the Taiwanese government that were involved in that, which he wasn't allowed to tell anyone that was part of the agreement are no longer alive.
1071000	1079000	The point is that there will be an in service of life underground movement.
1079000	1087000	There will be things going on that are responses and mitigations to the problems we face that no one knows about.
1087000	1092000	And hopefully some of you listening to this will do that.
1096000	1098000	That leads me to policy.
1098000	1105000	One of the policies that knowing about the human predicament and the great simplification we could do.
1105000	1118000	Well, on the surface level, there are some generic policies that would just generally be good ideas like term limits or age limits or getting the money out of politics.
1118000	1128000	Most of the things that I'm talking about are not only in the future, but to avoid these things from happening, the policies that we're voting for exactly the opposite direction.
1128000	1144000	So one of the things that I started a couple of years ago, and I've spoken to around 25 senators, governors, congressmen is the concept of advanced policy, which is those things that we will have to do in the coming decade,
1144000	1157000	but that are socially and politically too advanced to be accepted by the current political zeitgeist.
1157000	1168000	But we still need to do them to build research to do scenario planning to build constituency to create break gas glass plans.
1168000	1183000	I did some of that with some agencies of the US government back in 2014, but those aren't online, obviously, because talking about them makes them become self fulfilling prophecies or removes their potential effectiveness.
1183000	1200000	This is a long way of saying that solutions aren't going to just be listed 123 and followed linearly.
1200000	1210000	I think the last reason that I don't talk about solutions is probably the most salient one, which is truly I don't know.
1211000	1214000	I think it's clear to you all what I care about.
1214000	1216000	I am learning along with you.
1216000	1229000	It's one of the blessings of unexpected blessings of this podcast is I've come across so many really smart caring people who share my value systems and I'm learning along with you.
1229000	1239000	And so, you know, if you go to a doctor and you're sick, the doctor will diagnose you and give you a pill or do a surgery.
1239000	1246000	If you go to an auto mechanic and he or she will tell you what's wrong with your car and then they'll fix it.
1246000	1253000	Describing the great simplification doesn't qualify me or anyone to then know what to do.
1253000	1255000	I'm trying to describe it.
1255000	1270000	And it's my hope that there is a collective learning and a change in the conversation that creates emergent ideas, emergent responses.
1270000	1281000	So my main goal now is to paint the picture as clearly as I can myself and then get different aspects, different angles of it from my guests.
1281000	1285000	To further complicate things is we don't know what future is going to arrive.
1285000	1293000	There could be the AI, more boost in productivity, more door economy where we have more growth and more environmental impact.
1293000	1295000	There could be the great simplification.
1295000	1299000	This financial Wiley Coyote moment I've been talking about or there could be a collapse.
1299000	1303000	So how do we plan for those scenarios?
1304000	1313000	I at this point don't think that I'm trying, I mean, although pro-social prepping is one of the categories I think is important.
1313000	1316000	This isn't just a prepping channel.
1316000	1325000	There are other ones that exist and based on how my farm looks, you don't want to use me as an example on how to prep.
1325000	1344000	I'm still trying to save the whole, you know, social system in a way that we can go to a kinder, gentler, more sapient economy that includes the other species and the value of ecosystem services into our value system.
1344000	1351000	So I'm still trying to breathe life into that vision.
1351000	1356000	I hope this answers questions that none of you even had.
1356000	1370000	Actually, this feels important to me to describe what I'm trying to do and why a solution for the Metacrisis is kind of a unicorn or a carrot.
1370000	1374000	And the reality is that's not how the world works.
1374000	1384000	I have a very intense personal, frankly, hopefully on deck for next week about my family.
1384000	1390000	So until then, Womansajianba. Talk to you next week. Bye-bye.
