WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.640
We know that the AMOG is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down.

00:06.640 --> 00:11.680
We see from paleo data evidences that it might have happened before.

00:11.680 --> 00:18.320
And we are not really much closer to knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing,

00:18.320 --> 00:23.280
in terms of how much degree of global warming would be okay before the AMOG could collapse

00:23.280 --> 00:27.840
than we were like 20, 30 years ago, even though we know much more.

00:30.320 --> 00:37.040
Today's conversation is with Climate Physicist Levka Caesar.

00:37.680 --> 00:44.480
Levka works at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. Her current

00:44.480 --> 00:53.440
work primarily focuses on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, aka the AMOG, and its

00:53.440 --> 00:59.440
pivotal role in our climate system. Levka's research has produced seminal work on the past

00:59.520 --> 01:06.960
evolution of this important ocean current. In October of 2023, she also assumed the role of

01:06.960 --> 01:13.520
scientific lead for the newly launched Planetary Boundary Science Initiative at the Potsdam

01:13.520 --> 01:20.240
Institute. This conversation was a deep dive on all things AMOG, what we know, what we don't know,

01:20.880 --> 01:26.880
and what speculations are for the future of this critical component of our planetary systems.

01:26.880 --> 01:32.640
Please welcome Levka Caesar. Levka, great to see you.

01:34.640 --> 01:37.760
Yeah, great to talk to you, Nate. Thanks for inviting me.

01:37.760 --> 01:45.840
You are welcome. So usually when I host guests, I have their location on my globe, but since we're

01:45.840 --> 01:52.480
going to be talking about the AMOG, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation of the Atlantic

01:52.480 --> 02:01.680
Ocean, I highlighted the Atlantic Ocean as the theme location of the podcast. So you are a world

02:01.680 --> 02:08.880
renowned expert on ocean issues, especially the AMOG, and that's going to be the topic of our

02:09.920 --> 02:17.600
deep dive today. But let me first ask you this. How old were you, and what were you thinking

02:18.320 --> 02:24.160
when you first decided I want to be a scientist studying how Earth's natural systems work?

02:25.200 --> 02:29.920
That's a very interesting question because I have to admit I'm actually coming from the space

02:29.920 --> 02:35.440
science side. So when I was young, and I think even at the age of like eight, nine, I was really

02:35.440 --> 02:41.200
interested in the formation of black holes, the life cycle of stars. Then I had a period when I

02:41.200 --> 02:47.920
wanted to become an astronaut, and that basically sparked me to study physics, and it was then

02:47.920 --> 02:52.960
later during my studies that I kind of realized I want to do something that's closer to home and

02:52.960 --> 02:59.200
that feels a little bit more relevant. So I still really believe that astrophysics is really cool,

02:59.200 --> 03:06.080
and I don't know, physicists might call it sexy in terms of the data, the mechanisms, but yeah,

03:07.040 --> 03:11.440
I guess I was in about like 22 when I really did my bachelor's in physics that I realized

03:12.000 --> 03:18.320
physics can also be applied to our planet, to the Earth system, and can explain so many interesting

03:18.320 --> 03:25.200
and relevant phenomena, whether the ocean circulations that, yeah, basically then when I

03:25.200 --> 03:33.840
decided to shift my focus. Excellent. I shifted my focus when I was on Wall Street and realized

03:33.840 --> 03:41.120
that the externalities were not included in our prices, and we were in for a phase shift during

03:41.120 --> 03:50.160
my lifetime of the ecology and natural systems on Earth. So as you're well aware, global heating

03:50.160 --> 04:00.320
is in the news. Lots of people are worried and aware of climate change. Oceans are a very integral

04:00.320 --> 04:08.000
part of the climate system, but they don't get as much coverage in the news. There are multiple

04:08.000 --> 04:14.320
ocean risk that we face, ocean acidification, decline in oxygen content, sea level rise,

04:15.200 --> 04:22.000
overfishing, lots of different aspects. But what we're going to talk about today is the ocean

04:22.000 --> 04:29.680
currents and how they change and how they may be changing in the near and distant future. So can

04:29.680 --> 04:37.520
you start us off by describing what the AMOCK is and how critical it is to the function of climate

04:37.520 --> 04:45.280
as we know it today? Yes, sure. So the AMOCK, which is short for Atlantic Meridional Overturning

04:45.280 --> 04:51.280
Circulation, and I like that name, even though I guess for a lot of people it's kind of difficult to

04:51.280 --> 04:57.040
say it first, but it's actually a good description of what the system is. So the AMOCK is a system

04:57.040 --> 05:06.240
of ocean currents, covering the Atlantic, therefore Atlantic Meridional, because that's the geological

05:06.240 --> 05:12.080
term basically for saying something is moving in the north-south direction. And while the AMOCK is

05:12.080 --> 05:17.680
basically, when depending on where you look, moving in any direction, the main transport is on the

05:17.680 --> 05:25.680
north-south line. So the AMOCK is transporting a lot of warm saline water at or just below the surface

05:25.760 --> 05:31.040
of the ocean northward in the Atlantic. It's really coming even from the southern ocean,

05:31.040 --> 05:37.120
so it's really transporting the whole length of the Atlantic, these water masses, and then as

05:37.120 --> 05:45.520
basically it's going over the equator through the tropics and then entering the colder subpolar

05:45.520 --> 05:52.000
north Atlantic region. And basically with that it's coming into regions of colder air masses

05:52.000 --> 05:57.520
above the surface of the ocean and a lot of this heat is then being transported or basically

05:57.520 --> 06:04.400
released to the atmosphere. The water, the surface water is cooling down and cold water is denser

06:04.400 --> 06:10.320
compared to warmer water and this is then basically leading to a sinking of the water masses, which

06:10.320 --> 06:16.960
we call convection in physical terms basically. And these water masses then that are sinking

06:16.960 --> 06:23.440
down in the subpolar north Atlantic. And while the locations are the Erminger Sea, the Nordic Seas,

06:24.400 --> 06:28.240
the Leoparder Sea, but I guess if you're not an oceanographer, then probably you wouldn't know

06:28.240 --> 06:34.320
what these ocean regions are called. So it's basically around the Greenland ice sheet, so to

06:34.320 --> 06:39.600
the south of it, to the east of it, and there you have those places of this deep water formation.

06:39.600 --> 06:45.760
So the sinking of surface water masses that are being cooled down by the atmosphere, getting denser,

06:45.760 --> 06:50.720
getting heavier, and then are going to deeper ocean layers. And when I say deeper, I mean

06:50.720 --> 06:57.360
depths of two to three kilometers. And then these water masses together from the southward return

06:57.360 --> 07:04.480
flow of the AMOC, now transporting colder water southward at depths towards basically back towards

07:04.480 --> 07:11.200
the equator region. And it's mainly this exchange of warm surface water going towards the subpolar

07:11.200 --> 07:16.720
region and colder, deeper water going back, that leads to a lot of energy transport by the AMOC.

07:18.080 --> 07:24.240
Okay, let me let me pause you there for a little bit of history. And I'm going to pretend that I

07:24.240 --> 07:32.640
don't know much about this, which I don't really have to pretend much. We've had the AMOC current

07:32.640 --> 07:40.000
forever, or since there were seven continents, right? I mean, we've been aware of this and able

07:40.000 --> 07:46.000
to look back in time. And this current that you described has been there for a long time, right?

07:47.520 --> 07:53.200
It has been there for a long time. Forever is probably difficult to say.

07:54.480 --> 08:02.480
But yeah. And is this a new, I know there's a new paper out by your colleagues, I believe,

08:03.440 --> 08:11.360
and yourself, on the risks that the AMOC poses in the near future. But is awareness of this

08:11.360 --> 08:15.520
current? Is this a relatively new thing? Or is scientists known about this for a long time?

08:17.440 --> 08:24.240
Actually, no, there are, within the scientific community, this kind of starts with Henry Stommel,

08:24.240 --> 08:30.960
who's one of, yeah, famous oceanographer, who already in the 60s basically assessed that this

08:31.040 --> 08:35.600
overturning circulation, which first of all is special to the Atlantic, so we do not have this

08:35.600 --> 08:42.000
kind of overturning circulation in the Pacific, that it exists, that it's very special in the

08:42.000 --> 08:47.600
sense that normally when we look at either ocean currents or atmospheric currents, they would always

08:47.600 --> 08:53.280
transport heat from the tropics to the polar regions, because basically the sun is heating the

08:53.280 --> 08:58.000
earth in the sense we have most of the radiation going towards the tropics and then less towards

08:58.000 --> 09:05.120
the polar regions. And as is usually the case, basically the systems thrive towards

09:06.320 --> 09:11.040
distributing the heat more homogeneously. So basically, when you have a lot of heating at

09:11.040 --> 09:16.240
one place and no heating at the others, you have a movement of either water or air masses

09:16.240 --> 09:20.800
from the heated region to the colder regions. But the AMOC is special because it can actually

09:20.800 --> 09:26.960
transport heat above the equator. It's transporting heat from the southern to the northern hemisphere.

09:27.600 --> 09:33.680
And that makes it really special. And that the system is there, basically, and why it can be

09:33.680 --> 09:41.040
there, which is like a delicate balance, basically of freshwater, saline water, heating and cooling

09:41.920 --> 09:47.200
in the Atlantic. That is something that has been known, as I said, for several decades now.

09:47.760 --> 09:53.760
And also an understanding of the mechanism that it doesn't have to be there, so that in principle

09:53.760 --> 10:00.480
it's possible that there is no AMOC, or theoretically we could even say the AMOC could be flowing the

10:00.480 --> 10:06.640
other way around. So as I said, we have a northward surface flow and a southward deep flow. We could

10:06.640 --> 10:12.480
also have a circulation in the Atlantic where we have a southward surface flow, deep water formation

10:12.480 --> 10:17.680
basically in the southern ocean, and then a northward deep water return flow. But that's not

10:17.680 --> 10:23.040
the case. The way, basically, our earth system is set right now through the fact that we have

10:23.680 --> 10:28.720
the heating in the tropics, we have then evaporation of water masses, of the warm water masses in the

10:28.720 --> 10:35.360
tropics, and more precipitation rainfall in the north Atlantic. This balance is basically

10:35.360 --> 10:40.960
played out at the moment that we have the AMOC as it is flowing today with the northward surface flow.

10:41.920 --> 10:50.160
Okay, so I'm going to jump around here, but give us the punchline first and then we'll backfill from

10:50.160 --> 10:58.720
there. What is happening to the AMOC now and what are the risks or the scenarios you see in

10:59.280 --> 11:04.080
coming decades or centuries or millennia based on what's already built in?

11:04.160 --> 11:11.600
Yeah, so what we see now is basically a slowdown of this circulation system, very simply said.

11:11.600 --> 11:17.360
And while scientifically it's always a little bit difficult to give exact numbers, everything

11:17.360 --> 11:26.160
hints towards a slowdown of about 15% over the last few decades. And again, it's more difficult to

11:26.160 --> 11:31.360
say why something is happening compared to then just observing it and saying it is happening,

11:31.360 --> 11:36.960
but we do understand under which circumstances, what are the mechanisms that could drive such a

11:36.960 --> 11:43.280
slowdown. And this is mainly related to a freshwater influx into the sub-poller north Atlantic.

11:43.280 --> 11:48.800
So I already kind of said that what is driving this ocean circulation is really a formation of

11:48.800 --> 11:54.960
deeper water masses, a sinking of water masses in the sub-poller north Atlantic around Greenland.

11:54.960 --> 12:00.160
And then basically when you have water sinking at some place, you have to have an inflow at the

12:00.160 --> 12:05.440
surface that is kind of filling this gap just due to volume conservation. And then this deep water

12:05.440 --> 12:10.960
has to go somewhere. And basically with how the earth is set, the rotation of the earth,

12:10.960 --> 12:17.120
the way it is basically that we have a southward deep water flow and then this surface northward

12:17.120 --> 12:22.800
flow. But if we now put a lot of freshwater into the sub-poller north Atlantic, what is happening

12:22.800 --> 12:31.040
is that the surface water there get lighter, less dense. This is because the density of ocean water

12:31.040 --> 12:35.200
depends on two things, the temperature, which I already mentioned, colder water being denser

12:35.200 --> 12:40.880
than light water, but also the salinity. And here I guess it also makes a lot of sense if I put more

12:40.880 --> 12:46.880
salt, more matter into something, I make it heavier and denser. Now if we put a lot of very

12:46.880 --> 12:52.800
fresh water, so no salinity basically into the sub-poller north Atlantic, then we lighten the

12:52.800 --> 12:58.080
surface water and we hinder, slow down this deep water formation, the sinking of water masses.

12:59.120 --> 13:04.640
Now that's in principle, that is understood, not just in principle, it is understood. The thing is

13:04.640 --> 13:11.120
that in real life, it's not happening in the way that we have at every minute, every place in the

13:11.120 --> 13:16.400
sub-poller north Atlantic deep water formation. So it's not like we sometimes call the over-turning

13:16.400 --> 13:20.560
circulation a conveyor belt, and I think there you mentioned something that is continuously

13:21.280 --> 13:26.800
going, flowing, but actually the deep water formation is happening from time to time,

13:26.800 --> 13:31.120
mainly in the winter time, because that's when the atmosphere is specifically cold.

13:31.120 --> 13:36.480
It's also then cooling the surface water the most, and then it's also happening at specific

13:36.480 --> 13:42.800
locations because it's really a delicate balance of what exactly is the local surface temperature,

13:42.800 --> 13:48.400
atmospheric temperature above that, what's the local salinity value, and that's also why it's

13:48.400 --> 13:53.840
difficult for us to say when are we really stopping this process, because we do know that we're now

13:53.840 --> 13:58.240
putting more fresh water in the sub-poller north Atlantic. The greenland ice sheet is melting,

13:58.240 --> 14:04.800
under climate change we see increased precipitation over this region, so also more fresh water,

14:05.440 --> 14:10.400
but whether or not and how much this influencing the over-turning circulation really depends on

14:10.400 --> 14:20.400
where exactly is what happening. So which is more, has a higher forcing component of salinity or

14:20.400 --> 14:27.040
temperature, like a small change in salinity or a small change in temperature, which causes the

14:27.040 --> 14:36.640
water to not descend or to descend faster? That's a very good question, and it depends.

14:37.120 --> 14:44.640
So because the relationship basically between temperature, salinity, and density is not linear,

14:44.640 --> 14:50.320
so basically how much, when I change the temperature a little bit, it matters whether I change it from

14:50.320 --> 14:57.040
20 to 21 degrees or whether I change it from 5 to 4 degrees. The differences or the effects on

14:57.040 --> 15:02.560
density are different and the same is with salinity. So we can't just talk about the change, we would

15:02.560 --> 15:08.320
have to also talk about the background state and then look at the change to say what is more important

15:08.320 --> 15:14.640
and then also when we look at it right now, in terms of the more dominant driver is actually the

15:14.640 --> 15:21.360
temperature, but in terms of what we human change and how we change it, it's actually, the system

15:21.360 --> 15:29.040
is more sensitive to salinity changes right now. So here's a dumb question, but it's my podcast,

15:29.120 --> 15:39.520
so I can ask some dumb questions. When water evaporates from the ocean, the ocean is a salt water,

15:39.520 --> 15:44.960
but when it evaporates, the salt doesn't evaporate, the salt stays in the ocean,

15:44.960 --> 15:53.840
so the clouds just get non-saline water droplets, and the part two of the question is,

15:54.800 --> 16:00.640
as we head into a world with a higher standard deviation of precipitation, floods and droughts,

16:00.640 --> 16:10.320
et cetera, does this changing precipitation pattern over the oceans and supposedly indirectly

16:10.320 --> 16:14.880
over the land which would run off into the ocean, does that higher standard deviation

16:15.840 --> 16:22.320
indirectly affect the salinity of the melt water in the oceans and change this amok?

16:23.200 --> 16:27.680
So first of all, your first question, comment, I'm just going to comment that was right,

16:27.680 --> 16:34.240
so basically rain is freshwater and the salt just stays in the ocean when it evaporates,

16:34.240 --> 16:40.400
which is why when we have more precipitation over an ocean region, we are freshening the water there,

16:40.400 --> 16:47.360
we are decreasing the salinity, and yes, I mean the thing is, unless with global warming where we

16:47.360 --> 16:53.040
can basically say it might depend on the region, but in general we see global warming globally,

16:53.040 --> 16:58.160
so there's warming close to everywhere, when we talk about the changes in precipitation,

16:58.800 --> 17:04.880
there it's way more difficult, so we have a tendency of saying, okay, the regions that now

17:04.880 --> 17:09.680
receive precipitation are likely going to receive more and the drier regions are going to be drier

17:09.680 --> 17:15.120
in the future, but that's like more a general thing, it doesn't have to be true for every place,

17:15.680 --> 17:21.200
but we can see in our climate simulations that yeah, there's a tendency towards more

17:21.200 --> 17:26.400
precipitation over the regions where the deep water formation for the amok is happening,

17:26.400 --> 17:31.360
and that in itself is basically bad for the amok because it can slow it down,

17:32.000 --> 17:37.120
but that alone wouldn't be the problem, I think a bigger problem is actually the melting of the

17:37.120 --> 17:42.400
ice sheets because due to the reason what you said, also snow basically, I mean that's frozen

17:42.400 --> 17:48.160
precipitation, so that is also pure freshwater, and all this melting runoff coming from the

17:48.160 --> 17:54.240
green and ice sheet and entering the sub-Polaroid Atlantic, that's actually potentially very harmful

17:54.240 --> 18:01.200
for the amok, but there are also other effects, just basically the surface warming that we see

18:01.920 --> 18:09.200
globally in the oceans could also hinder the or slow down the amok because it's also making

18:09.200 --> 18:15.120
the surface water lighter, enhancing what we call the stratification of the ocean, really meaning

18:15.120 --> 18:20.480
that there's not a lot of vertical mixing, and therefore also, yeah, tindering the deep water

18:20.480 --> 18:28.320
formation, so there are really multiple effects overlaying this, and I could actually get on

18:28.320 --> 18:33.600
and go on and on because it gets even more complicated, I listened to a few of your podcasts

18:33.600 --> 18:40.720
and you also talked already about the aerosol forcing basically, and it's important for climate

18:40.720 --> 18:46.480
change, and that actually also plays a role for the amok because a lot of the aerosols right now

18:47.040 --> 18:52.480
where they are basically are located in the atmosphere, it's cooling regions that could also

18:52.480 --> 18:58.400
be critical for the amok and help in that sense, kind of and basically be good for the amok in

18:58.400 --> 19:03.440
terms of it's cooling the regions where the deep water formation is taking place, and that might

19:03.440 --> 19:08.640
help the driver of the amok, but that also really depends on where exactly, and this is something

19:08.640 --> 19:13.920
that is different from climate model to climate model, which is why it's so difficult for us to

19:13.920 --> 19:19.520
really say what is going to happen to the amok. We're going to get into the implications of this,

19:19.520 --> 19:28.800
which are potentially quite horrific in the coming century, but as a scientist, and I can

19:28.800 --> 19:35.600
tell from your voice, do you ever feel a sense of wonder that teams of humans with technology and

19:35.600 --> 19:40.480
computers and observations were able to figure out the things that you're describing today?

19:40.480 --> 19:47.600
I mean, it's pretty cool, right, that we can understand the dynamics of the ocean currents

19:47.600 --> 19:51.840
and all that. Do you ever feel like, wow, this is amazing?

19:52.640 --> 19:58.240
When I take the time and take a step back, I guess from what I'm doing, because I mean, in my

19:58.240 --> 20:04.720
day-to-day work, I'm more concentrated on what we do not know and what we haven't figured out yet,

20:04.720 --> 20:11.680
and from that point of view, it's also a little bit frustrating because we know that the amok

20:11.680 --> 20:16.080
is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down.

20:16.080 --> 20:23.520
We see from paleo data evidences that it might have happened before, and we are not really

20:23.520 --> 20:29.040
much closer to knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing, in terms of how much

20:29.040 --> 20:33.760
degree of global warming would be okay before the amok could collapse than we were like 20,

20:33.760 --> 20:39.280
30 years ago, even though we know much more. But basically, in discovering more, we also

20:39.280 --> 20:44.000
discovered that there are more uncertainties and more things we do not understand, and that

20:44.000 --> 20:47.120
all in all led to the thing that we are still pretty uncertain.

20:47.680 --> 20:53.920
Let me give you three scenarios, and you can speculate knowing, like you just said, we don't

20:53.920 --> 21:00.320
know, but you're very knowledgeable on this topic. The first scenario is that the amok slows around

21:00.320 --> 21:08.480
15% and stays there, kind of like it's doing now. The second scenario is that it continues to slow

21:09.920 --> 21:16.320
another 50% or something like that. The third scenario is that the amok actually stops

21:17.440 --> 21:23.440
in the coming 100 years or 200 years or something like that. Under those three scenarios, what would

21:23.440 --> 21:30.640
be some of the effects that the world could experience, or Europe and the North Atlantic

21:31.280 --> 21:38.480
coast in the USA and Canada? Can you just paint a picture of what the future might look like under

21:38.480 --> 21:45.280
these three scenarios? Sure. Maybe just as a feedback question, what kind of climate change

21:45.280 --> 21:50.880
scenario otherwise are we looking at? Basically, because that again is very important, are we

21:50.880 --> 21:55.760
looking at a global warming world, or are we saying, okay, we keep this level of global warming

21:55.760 --> 22:06.480
plus an amok slowdown collapse? Right. This podcast, we talk about neuroscience and debt

22:06.720 --> 22:14.800
biodiversity and climate and economics. Every one of those is unbelievably complex, and yet,

22:14.800 --> 22:20.640
and this is what we're trying to do. What you're saying is that let's keep everything

22:20.640 --> 22:26.400
constant with climate the way it is right now today. If we were able to do that, which of course,

22:26.400 --> 22:32.000
we're not, this is just a thought experiment, then the amok would exhibit under those three

22:32.000 --> 22:38.480
scenarios. I said it would have certain effects, or you could look at it as what is the, at two

22:38.480 --> 22:46.080
degrees above pre-industrial Celsius, what would do the amok? They're moving in tandem.

22:46.640 --> 22:54.560
Let's just say that two to two and a half degrees Celsius in the three scenarios I told you.

22:55.520 --> 23:02.240
Yeah, so basically, if the amok stays as it is right now, so basically, it slowed down by about

23:02.240 --> 23:12.080
15%, then we would probably, I mean, see what we link to the amok at the moment, which is,

23:12.080 --> 23:16.560
I already talked about this global warming signal. You see global warming, or the warming

23:16.560 --> 23:20.880
everywhere around the globe, but actually, when you look at the long-term temperature trends,

23:20.880 --> 23:26.800
you can see that the mid-center of the North Atlantic cooled over the last century.

23:27.600 --> 23:31.520
Of course, this is not true for every single year. I mean, right now, we are having extreme

23:31.520 --> 23:36.240
warm sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, but the long-term trend for that region

23:36.240 --> 23:41.760
actually has a slight cooling signal, which is unique seen globally. And that is something

23:41.760 --> 23:47.520
that we link to the decrease in amok strength and the decrease of heat being transported.

23:47.520 --> 23:52.160
So the amok normally transports heat into that region, as the amok slows down,

23:52.160 --> 23:57.760
less heat is being transported into that region, which is why we can see a global cooling signal,

23:57.760 --> 24:04.800
a local cooling signal in that region, despite global warming. This is now making it more

24:04.800 --> 24:14.560
complicated, because when we change the local rate of warming, basically, if that is different

24:14.560 --> 24:20.800
from one place to another, then this has an effect on the atmosphere in terms of when we look at

24:21.520 --> 24:27.600
the changes in sea surface temperatures pattern. So that's what the amok is doing. It's kind of

24:27.600 --> 24:34.080
heating some of the ocean surfaces and cooling others by transporting heat. And this then is

24:34.080 --> 24:39.920
being translated to the atmosphere by either warming or cooling the air there. And this then

24:39.920 --> 24:45.520
leads, for example, when we have strong amok, we have a heating, the local air above that region

24:45.520 --> 24:51.680
rises, we have a low pressure system above that surface region, a higher pressure system in the

24:51.680 --> 24:57.200
air, or up higher up in the air. And what I'm trying to say, I'm probably doing a very complicated

24:57.200 --> 25:01.760
job in doing is, is that we have an effect on weather systems. And what has been shown for

25:01.760 --> 25:09.200
the amok is basically that a slower amok can actually lead to heat extremes over Europe in

25:09.200 --> 25:16.080
the summertime by influencing the state and location of the jet stream and the weather systems

25:16.080 --> 25:24.240
that are moving with that. So you're saying that the ocean current dynamics of the amok would

25:24.240 --> 25:31.120
create a cool blob in the North Atlantic. And because of the jet stream and the pressures

25:31.840 --> 25:35.920
that that actually could cause a heat wave in continental Europe.

25:36.080 --> 25:44.800
Yes, exactly. Because it's determining how the jet stream is located. And that then determines

25:44.800 --> 25:49.920
whether the air that is coming towards Europe is either coming from polar regions or whether it's

25:49.920 --> 25:56.320
coming from the African continent. And in that case, this would actually favor an air pressure

25:56.320 --> 26:02.960
distribution where we have more air coming from the South towards Europe, so hotter air and therefore

26:02.960 --> 26:10.480
can lead to heat extremes. Okay, so carry on with my speculative question. What would be

26:11.200 --> 26:17.680
some of the effects if under these three scenarios, and you can tell me what climate

26:17.680 --> 26:23.600
scenario you would like to choose. I just want to isolate as much as possible. Of course,

26:23.600 --> 26:28.320
we're part of a complex adaptive system, so we can't just talk about the amok without the other

26:28.320 --> 26:35.760
things. But I don't think many people understand the risk associated with just this one ocean issue.

26:35.760 --> 26:44.000
So maybe you could explain under a not too bad, bad and horrible scenario what some of the impacts

26:44.000 --> 26:50.160
would be. Yes, I think maybe I'm talking mainly about the impacts. And with most of them, I think

26:50.160 --> 26:56.640
the risk is just going to be higher under a stronger amok slowdown scenario. Maybe it's a

26:56.640 --> 27:01.600
little bit different for a complete collapse of the amok. So what we know what the amok is important

27:01.600 --> 27:07.120
for, I said it's important for the heat transport. It's also important actually for getting heat from

27:07.120 --> 27:11.920
the atmosphere, extracting that and getting it into the deeper ocean. So in a way, it's also

27:11.920 --> 27:17.600
important for cooling the atmosphere. We know right now that, and I guess maybe some of you have

27:17.600 --> 27:23.920
heard that, the ocean is taking up about 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming.

27:24.560 --> 27:32.800
And how does that happen? Yeah, basically, it's kind of a simple loss of thermodynamics and physics

27:34.080 --> 27:37.360
and I guess you know that. I mean, if you have two systems of different temperature,

27:38.080 --> 27:43.120
then you will have a transport of heat from the hotter to the colder system. That's basically

27:43.120 --> 27:49.040
why we get cold when we go outside in the winter time. And I think it might be also

27:49.040 --> 27:55.280
then important to know that this effect is stronger with water. Maybe you know when you are

27:55.280 --> 28:02.240
out in 25 degrees air, it's a warm summertime. If you stay in water that's 25 degrees Celsius for

28:02.240 --> 28:07.920
a longer time, you will actually get chilly because the heat capacity of water is four times

28:07.920 --> 28:13.680
larger than that of air. Basically, it can take up heat easier, but it's also conducting the heat

28:13.680 --> 28:21.840
faster away from you. And what's happening really is we heat the atmosphere and the ocean below that

28:21.840 --> 28:28.400
is colder. They're not in equilibrium and normally systems will always tend towards going into an

28:28.400 --> 28:33.280
equilibrium. And because of that, we have a heat flux from the atmosphere to the ocean. Now the

28:33.280 --> 28:40.960
thing is, it's really, the ocean is vast. So the mass of the ocean is, even though of course it's

28:40.960 --> 28:47.520
in terms of depth, it's up to 11 kilometers. So that's not as deep as the atmosphere is going in

28:47.520 --> 28:54.880
height, but because the air gets thinner as we go up into the air, the mass of the oceans actually

28:54.880 --> 29:00.000
more than 100 times larger than that of the air and the atmosphere. So the ocean really has way

29:00.000 --> 29:09.440
more capacity for taking up additional heat. So the good news is that our planet has these deep

29:09.440 --> 29:20.320
and cold oceans that have buffered the effects of heat from our greenhouse gas trapping activities.

29:20.320 --> 29:25.440
The bad news is, is they've done this largely invisibly without being recognized and we've

29:25.440 --> 29:33.040
taken this buffer for granted. And what an amazing thing that these oceans are so potent,

29:33.040 --> 29:39.520
but they've kind of blinded and caused a delay in our ecological impacts, yes?

29:40.240 --> 29:48.080
Yes, that exactly. And it's basically a problem that is emerging right now, because you probably

29:48.080 --> 29:53.520
know the problems that we see with coral reefs and the bleaching effect. I mean, and that is also

29:53.520 --> 29:58.400
due to ocean acidification, but it's mainly due to marine heat waves. And this is something we're

29:58.400 --> 30:04.400
seeing now more and more as we're heating up the ocean. And also, it might lead to us taking for

30:04.400 --> 30:09.920
granted that the ocean can take up this much heat and, by the way, also carbon. But that is not

30:09.920 --> 30:16.000
necessarily the case. I mean, as I said, systems tend to want an equilibrium. So if we put more

30:16.000 --> 30:21.600
heat carbon into the atmosphere, the ocean will take up more. But the pace of how fast the ocean

30:21.600 --> 30:26.880
can do that depends on how strong the ocean is stratified and how much deep water formation

30:26.880 --> 30:32.720
also we have. So basically, the deep water formation kind of acts as a link between the upper

30:32.720 --> 30:38.560
ocean and the deep ocean. And if we don't have that anymore, then the upper ocean takes up heat

30:38.560 --> 30:45.200
and carbon, but it's fairly full soon, basically, because it's a thin layer. And it really only

30:45.200 --> 30:50.080
triggers very slowly to the deep ocean. And therefore, there will be like a delay time

30:50.080 --> 30:55.120
when we have the deep ocean connected to the upper ocean via deep water formation,

30:55.120 --> 31:00.400
then we can take up or the ocean can take up the heat and carbon much faster. And that's important,

31:00.400 --> 31:07.360
but that might actually be hindered in the future by the effect itself, by the increased

31:07.360 --> 31:13.360
stratification because of warming the ocean. And yeah. Yeah, so many questions, Lefka.

31:15.600 --> 31:20.480
We're talking about the Amock in the Atlantic Ocean. But presumably, there are currents in

31:20.560 --> 31:24.160
all the other oceans as well that we're just talking about the Atlantic one, right?

31:25.200 --> 31:35.280
Yes. Yeah. And in the past, I've had on a friend of mine, Peter Ward, who's a paleobiologist who's

31:35.280 --> 31:41.440
written books, one book called Under a Green Sky, which was about a historical

31:42.080 --> 31:49.600
period called a Canfield Ocean where they became stratified and produced hydrogen sulfide gas.

31:49.600 --> 31:56.880
And there was no exchange between the different layers. What are the possibilities of that

31:56.880 --> 32:03.040
happening? And what are your thoughts on that? Well, I mean, in principle, it's never completely

32:03.040 --> 32:09.680
going to happen, right? I mean, even if you have like a very stratified ocean, if you keep warming

32:09.680 --> 32:14.640
the atmosphere and with that the upper ocean, there will always be a little bit of mixing

32:14.640 --> 32:20.160
and diffusion basically, and the heat is going to travel downwards. But normally,

32:20.160 --> 32:25.920
and this is why the Amock is so important, as I said, that's a place where we have a lot of mixing

32:25.920 --> 32:33.200
with from the surface ocean with a deeper ocean. And it's basically the difference in I put a drop

32:33.200 --> 32:39.520
of color, let's say into a water glass or a water bottle. If I wait a very long time,

32:39.520 --> 32:44.240
it's going to mix perfectly, but I would have to wait a very long time. If I take the bottle

32:44.240 --> 32:50.000
and shake it, I can do it within a second. And the effect is not as big with the Amock,

32:50.000 --> 32:54.400
because it is a local effect, but it's still a deep region or a large region in the North

32:54.400 --> 33:00.320
Atlantic where we have a mixing between upper and lower or deeper ocean. And that's why it's so

33:00.320 --> 33:06.320
important. And the same is kind of happening, as I said, with carbon. So also the carbon uptake

33:06.320 --> 33:11.600
of the ocean is again, it's the same principle. We have an equilibrium between the carbon pressure

33:11.600 --> 33:16.560
in the atmosphere and the one in the ocean. We put right now more in the atmosphere,

33:17.200 --> 33:22.080
the ocean is taking it up. And the speed depends on the rate of mixing in the ocean.

33:22.880 --> 33:30.800
Okay, so the oceans have taken up approximately 90% of the additional heat

33:32.320 --> 33:37.440
in the atmosphere and approximately 50% of the carbon, something like that?

33:38.320 --> 33:42.560
Yeah, I think it's a little bit more. I'm not completely sure about the number,

33:42.560 --> 33:44.480
but I think it's more like two thirds of the carbon.

33:45.040 --> 33:53.360
Okay, so can this continue indefinitely at this pace? I assume the answer is no.

33:56.880 --> 34:03.040
What is the mechanism that reduces the ability of oceans to absorb heat and carbon?

34:03.600 --> 34:08.880
And what happens if they can't absorb anymore? Or what happens if they can't absorb as much?

34:09.440 --> 34:15.840
Yeah, so basically, the mechanisms are slightly different. As I said, it really is related to

34:17.120 --> 34:21.840
an equilibrium between atmosphere and surface and then the mixing basically between surface

34:21.840 --> 34:31.440
ocean and deeper ocean. With carbon, we also have the problem that it's a gas and gases are easier

34:31.520 --> 34:37.440
soluble in or you can dissolve them easy on cold water. So as we are warming the ocean,

34:37.440 --> 34:44.240
we are actually kind of reducing the capability of the ocean to take up carbon. I mean,

34:44.240 --> 34:49.120
as long as we keep pushing more carbon into the atmosphere, the ocean is going to take up more

34:49.120 --> 34:55.920
carbon because we increase that pressure. But if that process is slowing down, then we see, of

34:55.920 --> 35:00.800
course, also a faster rise in atmospheric carbon concentration because we have to

35:02.000 --> 35:07.680
make the pressure even higher from the atmosphere on the ocean for the ocean to keep taking up.

35:07.680 --> 35:12.240
And then the problem is, of course, also that this equilibrium is going to change in the future.

35:12.240 --> 35:18.000
Let's imagine we stop with our CO2 emissions and we actually manage to stabilize the atmospheric

35:18.800 --> 35:24.480
CO2 concentrations and even reduce them. Then at some point, basically, the ocean is going to

35:24.560 --> 35:30.400
outgas that additional carbon right now and giving it back to the atmosphere and the same

35:30.400 --> 35:34.960
as with the heat. If we start cooling the atmosphere by going into the right direction,

35:34.960 --> 35:40.080
basically, because it's what we want, then the ocean who's now acting as a buffer might give

35:40.080 --> 35:46.720
that back on long time scale. So it's really also, yeah, has to change how we are treating

35:46.720 --> 35:52.400
our solutions and our future pathways by having to consider what we are now changing in the ocean

35:52.400 --> 35:59.760
system. So we're going to get our carbon security deposit kicked back to us at the end. So the

35:59.760 --> 36:09.440
buffer turns into a boomerang. Once our emissions slow or stabilize, hopefully soon, maybe in 100

36:09.440 --> 36:15.520
years or something like that, the oceans are going to then give some of that back at some point.

36:16.400 --> 36:19.040
Yes, exactly. And we have to take that into account.

36:20.000 --> 36:25.760
Are we taking that into account? That's a very good question. I think in general,

36:25.760 --> 36:32.480
of course, we are aware of that. But most climate scenarios that we calculate often,

36:32.480 --> 36:37.280
they stop in 2100. As if our world stops in 2100.

36:38.000 --> 36:44.720
Exactly. And that's not really an oceanic time scale. Let's put it like that. So I guess often,

36:44.800 --> 36:49.520
it's not taken enough into account. So in the earth system timelines,

36:50.240 --> 36:56.960
this is something that's important to look at. Yes. Yeah. Okay, so getting back to the three

36:56.960 --> 37:06.720
scenarios, just let's just say that we don't do anything to abate our emissions and economic

37:06.720 --> 37:15.920
growth is somehow able to continue and EMA continues to slow. What are some of the impacts on

37:15.920 --> 37:22.800
Europe and the world under those scenarios? Just as a disclaimer, basically, it's in general kind

37:22.800 --> 37:28.960
of complicated to really like single out what is an EMAG effect and what is an effect, basically,

37:28.960 --> 37:36.320
of a changing earth system when the EMAG is also changing. Let's assume that they change

37:36.400 --> 37:45.040
at the same rate, the rate they're changing now. Yeah. So basically, this knowledge is coming

37:45.040 --> 37:50.720
mainly from either paleo data or climate models. So when we basically look at the climate model,

37:50.720 --> 37:56.880
then what we see is that when we slow down the AMOG, we have an increase in storm activity

37:56.880 --> 38:02.640
and winter storms over Europe in the winter time, which is mainly related basically to

38:03.520 --> 38:08.240
changes in the sea surface temperatures pattern in the North Atlantic, which is driving the winds,

38:08.240 --> 38:15.920
and that's basically what we can see. We also expect changes in precipitation, mainly over summer,

38:15.920 --> 38:20.400
and that really depends on where in Europe you look, but in general, it seems to get a little bit

38:20.400 --> 38:28.320
drier with an AMOG slowdown. The explanation is fairly easy in the way that if we put less heat

38:28.400 --> 38:32.240
into the North Atlantic, we have less evaporation, and due to the wind system,

38:32.240 --> 38:38.160
normally this evaporation is being transported towards Europe. When we look at the US coast,

38:38.160 --> 38:45.760
we actually see an increase in sea level rise, and the explanation is actually quite beautiful.

38:46.320 --> 38:50.080
I mean, it's not a good thing, but the explanation is beautiful in the way,

38:50.080 --> 38:54.800
because I don't know whether many people know that, but when we would look at the ocean surface,

38:54.800 --> 39:00.160
it's actually not flat. So basically, when you look from space at the ocean surfaces,

39:00.160 --> 39:07.280
you really have hills and bumps and so on, and that is basically because water masses are moved,

39:07.280 --> 39:13.520
and we have, due to the rotation of our Earth, we have a constant force. I mean,

39:13.520 --> 39:19.520
physically saying, we say Coriolis effect, not force, because it's not in a physical

39:19.520 --> 39:23.440
divinitional force, but basically we have something that is moving the water masses

39:24.400 --> 39:28.560
if something is moving more northward on the Northern Hemisphere, it's being deflected to the

39:28.560 --> 39:34.880
right. And now when we look at the surface currents of the Amock on the Northern Hemisphere,

39:34.880 --> 39:39.440
they are moving northward, so water masses are being deflected to the right towards the

39:39.440 --> 39:44.560
midst of the North Atlantic, which is when you would look at the North Atlantic. You actually

39:44.560 --> 39:53.040
have a water hill in the middle of it, and lower water levels, or basically towards the coast of

39:53.040 --> 39:59.200
the US. And that is really linked to the strength of the surface current of the Amock. And if that

39:59.200 --> 40:03.680
strength is slowing down, if that current is slowing down, then basically this water hill

40:03.680 --> 40:08.640
in the middle of the Atlantic is getting lower, and the sea level at the US east coast is getting up.

40:09.440 --> 40:15.360
And again, it's kind of really complicated to say or difficult to say how much exactly that

40:15.360 --> 40:20.560
would be. So from climate simulation, it seems like a complete shutdown of the Amock could

40:20.640 --> 40:26.400
lead to an additional approximately one meter of sea level rise at the US east coast,

40:26.400 --> 40:30.640
but there it also really depends on the city because of complicated dynamics,

40:30.640 --> 40:33.040
but that's a link that we know of.

40:34.480 --> 40:39.760
And what about the temperatures in Europe, if there's a large slowing or shutdown?

40:41.200 --> 40:49.920
Well, if there's a shutdown, it could be locally up to 10 degrees or more, and that depends on,

40:49.920 --> 40:53.120
do I look at the annual mean temperature? Hotter or colder?

40:53.920 --> 41:01.040
Colder. If the Amock shuts down, then because of this missing heat transport by the Amock

41:01.040 --> 41:05.120
towards the northern hemisphere and Europe, it gets colder.

41:07.760 --> 41:12.240
So like the movie the day after tomorrow, just not as exaggerated?

41:13.120 --> 41:16.960
Not as exaggerated and not as fast, of course. I mean, in the day after tomorrow,

41:16.960 --> 41:22.320
everything happens within weeks. And that's something of course, it's also important to stress.

41:22.320 --> 41:29.280
We know that the Amock has a tipping point, which means that if we push it too much towards

41:29.280 --> 41:35.360
slowing down, there are feedbacks within the system that basically would continue the slowdown

41:35.360 --> 41:41.360
process and would lead to an even slower Amock. But this is not happening within days or weeks,

41:41.360 --> 41:46.320
but decades. Could you just briefly mention one or two of those such feedbacks?

41:47.120 --> 41:51.920
Yes, one is actually, and this is a nice thing, I guess, that we are talking about the same

41:51.920 --> 42:00.800
principles. And again, again, the Amock itself is, as I said, it's transporting warm and saline

42:00.800 --> 42:07.920
water, surface waters northward. And I said, ocean density is determined by temperature and salinity.

42:07.920 --> 42:13.200
So basically, the Amock by transporting salt towards the region where the deep water formation

42:13.200 --> 42:20.720
of the Amock is occurring is actually kind of enforcing its own driver. It is making the water

42:20.720 --> 42:26.880
denser where it needs it to be dense to keep going. But if the Amock slows down, then we have

42:26.880 --> 42:33.680
less salt there. And it's, of course, it's a different effect from adding fresh water to the

42:33.680 --> 42:38.800
system. But the result is the same, less salt in the subpoena north Atlantic, where the Amock

42:38.800 --> 42:45.120
deep water formation occurs. You are so smart and articulate. And I have to also point out that

42:45.120 --> 42:51.840
you were doing this not in your native language. So it's so impressive and important and interesting.

42:51.840 --> 42:57.120
So thank you. Thanks for pointing that out. Sometimes I feel a little bit stupid when I say

42:57.120 --> 43:03.120
something in English and the world's tumbled out of my mouth. I could never do a scientific climate

43:03.120 --> 43:09.600
discussion in English, let alone German, the way that you're doing now. So let me ask you

43:09.600 --> 43:18.560
another dumb question. If Amock slows or stops, it could be up to 10 degrees Celsius cooler in Europe.

43:18.560 --> 43:27.200
But this is why while at the same time global warming is occurring. So does that mean elsewhere

43:27.280 --> 43:33.440
in the world, there's somewhere that has a corresponding heat pump to make the whole

43:33.440 --> 43:36.640
thing a little bit net hotter? Or how does that work?

43:38.080 --> 43:45.200
Yes. So A, yes. So basically, again, Amock transporting heat from the southern to the

43:45.200 --> 43:50.240
northern hemisphere. If the Amock stops, we have more heat access in the southern hemisphere.

43:50.240 --> 43:55.360
And that is also what we see in any kind of simulation where we simulate an Amock shutdown

43:55.360 --> 44:03.920
is more heating in the southern hemisphere. Exactly where is difficult to say. It's probably,

44:03.920 --> 44:08.960
of course, in the North or in the South Atlantic, so in that region, but it kind of seems to spread

44:08.960 --> 44:18.400
globally. So this would not be good news for Brazil and Argentina who are already experiencing

44:18.400 --> 44:24.640
quite hot temperatures from climate? Exactly. And I would even go so far to say it's also not

44:24.640 --> 44:29.920
good news for us, even though we might have a cooling through an Amock slowdown or shutdown.

44:29.920 --> 44:35.920
And I mean, we now said, OK, it could be 10 degrees. It really depends on the simulation.

44:35.920 --> 44:40.800
But then we would have to add that a shutdown is probably going to occur. Maybe it occurs under

44:40.800 --> 44:44.720
five degrees of warming. So you could say, OK, great, we have five degrees of warming,

44:44.720 --> 44:51.360
10 degrees of cooling, so maybe a little bit of cooling. But A, this really, it's very local

44:51.440 --> 44:56.640
effect. So we don't know exactly where yet. And that is, of course, a very complicated thing,

44:56.640 --> 45:01.920
because it also means on how to be prepared for our future. It would be very different under

45:01.920 --> 45:07.120
an Amock shutdown than it is under a general global warming scenario with just an Amock slowdown.

45:08.000 --> 45:19.280
There are decreasing benefits in an economy to more complexity. There are also decreasing

45:20.160 --> 45:24.880
benefits to conversations with average people due to more and more complexity.

45:26.000 --> 45:33.040
And this is an incredibly complex topic. But a simplistic understanding is there a risk for

45:33.040 --> 45:42.080
trying to get people in Europe aware and engaged and voting and doing things to mitigate

45:42.960 --> 45:50.160
more global warming, that if they hear that the Amock is going to slow and that Europe is going

45:50.160 --> 46:00.480
to be a lot colder, doesn't that emotionally kind of defer the urgency of climate change at the

46:00.480 --> 46:06.800
margin to some people? Have you come across that? I haven't. And I think that's a very interesting

46:06.880 --> 46:15.040
thing that I haven't, because I think it shows that people understand enough about the complexity

46:15.040 --> 46:19.600
and that basically nobody could guarantee them that it's that they're better off with an Amock

46:19.600 --> 46:24.960
collapse. It's that that we tell them it's really something also depends on where in Europe you

46:24.960 --> 46:30.240
live. So it's not going to be like a cooling everywhere in Europe, but it will be really

46:30.240 --> 46:34.800
centered about the North Atlantic. It's going to change precipitation patterns. And I think

46:35.680 --> 46:41.440
looking basically at the last years with flooding events and draws and so on, people know that

46:41.440 --> 46:47.280
all these changes in dynamics apart from a simple change in temperature can

46:49.680 --> 46:55.040
give so much additional risk or bring so much additional risk that I think a lot of people

46:55.040 --> 46:59.920
know no, this is not something one risk, even though there might be a very, very small percentage

46:59.920 --> 47:06.080
that's actually going to benefit very few of us. So obviously, you can't distinguish

47:06.960 --> 47:14.800
you, Levka, wearing a scientist hat or wearing I'm a human being hat. But if you could just

47:15.600 --> 47:23.280
loosely release the scientist hat for a moment, where do you speculate in the distribution of

47:23.280 --> 47:30.400
possible futures? What's your gut feel on where we will eventually land in terms of

47:31.120 --> 47:36.480
temperature Celsius above pre industrial average? My feeling is we're going to land

47:36.480 --> 47:41.200
somewhere where we do not want to be. And that's basically what scares me. I think we're going

47:41.200 --> 47:48.400
to land somewhere where we are forced to act because the consequences are so dire and so extreme.

47:48.480 --> 47:54.960
And I mean, this is the problem is, of course, I think that the regions globally that are more

47:54.960 --> 48:00.160
vulnerable are not the ones where the power and the money sits. And that basically means that

48:00.720 --> 48:06.400
we are probably going to see the consequences maybe more in having more refugees and having

48:06.400 --> 48:14.320
more war zones and stuff like that. And yeah, it doesn't matter what the number is going to be.

48:14.320 --> 48:20.400
I think the reality is not going to be nice. I was just in India in the south of India and most

48:20.400 --> 48:27.040
people there don't know about climate science. They just know that it's well, it's 100 degrees

48:27.040 --> 48:33.600
there today in the south of India. And it kind of broke my heart because up until that moment,

48:34.560 --> 48:40.400
I cognitively knew that there's a billion 400 people in India and the Indian subcontinent is

48:40.400 --> 48:48.720
one of those places that it's going to warm and have higher wet bulb issues. But to be there in

48:48.720 --> 48:57.600
person and see the real warm, lovely people and culture, it kind of hit me because I visualized

48:58.480 --> 49:05.280
some of this happening not centuries from now, but in the coming decades. So I hear what you're

49:05.280 --> 49:13.840
saying. So how do you, and we'll get back to this, but I want to still ask you some questions

49:13.840 --> 49:21.360
about AMOC. How do you and your colleagues measure AMOC? How can you even measure such a thing?

49:22.480 --> 49:31.760
Yeah, that's very complicated actually. So even a few years or a few decades back,

49:31.760 --> 49:36.160
I think the first AMOC measurement that I know of, like a real measurement basically where they

49:36.160 --> 49:44.160
went into out onto the North Atlantic and put instruments out in the ocean is from 1959. And

49:44.160 --> 49:48.800
back then what they had to do is basically they really had to go on a research vessel and then

49:49.360 --> 49:53.920
drive along the whole width of the Atlantic, because you really have to go from basically

49:53.920 --> 50:01.360
Africa to the US and Brazil basically to really cover the whole length to take into account

50:01.360 --> 50:06.640
all of the water masses that are being moved. And that's how it was done for most of the time.

50:06.640 --> 50:13.440
And from these first measurements, and that's very costly, it takes a couple of weeks to actually do

50:13.440 --> 50:19.600
this. And yeah, just being on a research cruise every single day is, as I said, very expensive

50:19.600 --> 50:25.760
and resource extensive. But these first measurements that they made indicated that the AMOC slowed

50:25.760 --> 50:31.200
down by quite a bit between 1959 and I think the last measurement was in 2001, where they

50:31.200 --> 50:38.640
will really assess that. And the first estimate was the slowdown of 30% over that time. And that

50:38.640 --> 50:45.040
was of course a dire news, but it also led to a lot of scientists saying, well, can we really

50:45.040 --> 50:52.000
say that? Because this was deduced from five measurements to five research cruises basically,

50:52.000 --> 50:58.480
going out there over a course of 40 years. They were done during different times of the years,

50:58.480 --> 51:03.680
some were in spring, some were in autumn. And basically what they always gave us was one

51:03.680 --> 51:10.880
snapshot of AMOC strength in time. And I mean, basically, if I would try to understand how

51:10.880 --> 51:16.480
temperatures are changing, and basically I'm measuring the temperature right now today,

51:16.480 --> 51:21.600
and then tomorrow I'm going to measure the one in the morning and then the next time at night,

51:21.600 --> 51:26.560
then I know even though I have measurements from three consecutive days, I can't really

51:26.560 --> 51:29.920
deduce any trend from them because they're measured in different times of the day. And we

51:29.920 --> 51:35.200
know that there's internal variability with a day cycle. And the same is true for the AMOC,

51:35.200 --> 51:40.560
but on time scales so that we are not completely aware of yet. So there's not just an annual cycle,

51:40.560 --> 51:46.720
but there's an inter-annual cycle. And long story short, that's why they started in 2004

51:46.720 --> 51:52.640
to put instruments out into the Atlantic full-time to really have a continuous measurement.

51:52.640 --> 51:58.320
It's still very costly, it's a lot of work. So you have to have like researchers getting out there,

51:58.320 --> 52:02.720
putting the instrument in, they have to be exchanged every one or two years, they have

52:02.720 --> 52:10.720
to be calibrated. But from now, from 2004 on we have AMOC continuous data. The only thing is

52:10.720 --> 52:18.000
basically that 2004 until now that's 20 years. When we are looking at climate change, we don't

52:18.000 --> 52:23.360
talk just about 20 years. We talk about at least 30 years or longer because we know that there are

52:23.360 --> 52:28.640
internal variabilities at place and things can basically happen or you can have a trend over

52:28.640 --> 52:33.760
two to three years. That's not a long-term trend, but that's just really related. For example,

52:33.760 --> 52:39.120
I guess most people know the El Nino phenomena. All these things have effects on the earth system.

52:40.720 --> 52:48.960
So how does the AMOC relate to or does it relate to the Gulf Stream? And is there a risk of the

52:48.960 --> 52:58.080
Gulf Stream slowing down? So the AMOC and the Gulf Stream are two interesting partners, brothers,

52:58.080 --> 53:03.840
I would say, in the sense of sometimes we even talk or call the AMOC the Gulf Stream system

53:04.720 --> 53:09.520
because they are closely linked but they are different. And the important difference is

53:10.240 --> 53:16.480
the Gulf Stream is in surface current. It's a wind-driven surface current. Basically, we have

53:16.480 --> 53:21.120
wind systems over the North Atlantic. They pushed the water masses due to the Coriolis

53:21.120 --> 53:25.920
effects. The water masses are deflected to the right and this basically leads to the Gulf Stream

53:25.920 --> 53:31.200
flowing as it does. The Gulf Stream is when we look at the size of the Gulf Stream, it's way

53:31.200 --> 53:36.160
bigger than the AMOC. So depending on where you measure, whether it's close to Florida or more

53:36.160 --> 53:43.840
towards the inner, outer North Atlantic, the Gulf Stream has a volume transport between 30 to

53:43.840 --> 53:51.760
150 swerdrop. And swerdrop is this unit used by physical oceanographers. One swerdrop is a

53:51.760 --> 53:57.680
million cubic meters of water that are being transported per second. So Gulf Stream between

53:57.680 --> 54:03.360
30 and 150, maybe just as a comparison, the Amazon River, the largest river on earth,

54:03.360 --> 54:10.240
has a transport of 0.2 swerdrop. So what's being transported in the Atlantic is huge.

54:11.520 --> 54:17.520
But most of the Gulf Stream waters are then basically also end up on the return way as

54:17.520 --> 54:22.320
a surface current. And with return way, I mean basically the Gulf Stream is flowing northward

54:22.320 --> 54:27.440
and it's then being deflected to the right and to the right due also to the wind system. And we

54:27.440 --> 54:33.440
have a southward surface current along the European and African coast basically.

54:34.720 --> 54:38.320
We still have a little bit of a heat transport because we have the warm water masses going

54:38.320 --> 54:43.600
towards the North Atlantic. They're being cooled and a little bit colder water masses going back.

54:43.600 --> 54:49.440
But when we talk about the AMOC, we have an exchange of surface flow going towards the

54:49.440 --> 54:56.320
North Atlantic and deep water, really cold flows going southward. So in terms of driveout,

54:56.320 --> 55:01.440
for example, you could say the Gulf Stream is driven by the winds. The AMOC is mainly

55:01.440 --> 55:07.440
driven by density differences. Mainly I'm saying mainly because when we go out there and measure

55:07.440 --> 55:12.640
the AMOC, we can't ask the water masses, hey, what's your driver? Are you moving because of

55:12.640 --> 55:18.560
the winds or because of density differences? We just see moving water masses. And yeah,

55:18.560 --> 55:23.120
because of that, we would say probably that a small percentage of the Gulf Stream is basically

55:23.120 --> 55:28.240
ending up into the deep water formation region and is then becoming part of the AMOC.

55:28.240 --> 55:34.800
But the majority of the Gulf Stream is just being also traveling back southward as a surface current.

55:34.800 --> 55:40.160
And that part is not slowing down as long as we have the winds. When the AMOC will collapse,

55:40.160 --> 55:44.000
then the Gulf Stream would slow down a little bit that AMOC part of the Gulf Stream.

55:44.560 --> 55:49.440
And warmer temperatures affect both the Gulf Stream and the AMOC though,

55:50.320 --> 55:55.040
because the winds, to my knowledge, are created by the temperature differential

55:55.040 --> 56:01.760
between the equator and the poles. And if the poles warm a lot, then that temperature differential

56:01.760 --> 56:10.560
declines and that would reduce some of these winds, yes? Yes, that is true. I think although

56:10.560 --> 56:15.840
when we measure it right now, the wind effect is really not that large right now. But in principle,

56:15.840 --> 56:21.600
you are right that that's happening. This polar amplification is decreasing the temperature,

56:21.600 --> 56:24.720
gradient, and with that, the wind strength overall.

56:24.720 --> 56:30.320
So in one of the presentations that you have on your website and that you shared with me,

56:30.320 --> 56:36.320
you have a slide which we'll put on screen where you highlight that the AMOC effect has

56:36.320 --> 56:45.200
potentially just part of a domino effect in some of the other issues dealing with the Amazon and

56:45.200 --> 56:51.520
the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. Could you talk about the the feedbacks

56:51.520 --> 56:57.360
and the domino effect that relate to not only AMOC but the climate system?

56:57.360 --> 57:02.800
So the AMOC, I think, is special in the climate system as it's the one major connector between

57:02.800 --> 57:07.600
Tselvarn and Northern Hemisphere between the Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet.

57:07.600 --> 57:13.280
And when the AMOC, let's assume the AMOC would slow down by a lot, we kind of said, okay, that

57:13.280 --> 57:18.240
means more excess heat in the Southern Hemisphere, less in the Northern Hemisphere, that could, on the

57:18.240 --> 57:23.280
one hand side, stabilize the Greenland ice sheet because it's cooling down the sub-Polynorth Atlantic

57:23.280 --> 57:29.040
around Greenland and could therefore stabilize that ice sheet. But it would lead to more heat

57:29.040 --> 57:35.760
around Antarctica and could therefore, yeah, lead to more melting there and destabilize.

57:35.760 --> 57:40.000
When we look at Antarctica, mainly the western part is the one that we are worried about the

57:40.000 --> 57:46.560
most right now because it seems to be the most destable one already. And with that, of course,

57:47.760 --> 57:53.120
then enhance sea level rise. But, and this is really important, it kind of shows that the order

57:53.120 --> 57:58.560
of things happening has an effect. Because if the Greenland, I said a slowdown of the AMOC could

57:58.560 --> 58:03.760
stabilize the Greenland ice sheet, if the Greenland ice sheet is tipping, then this would actually

58:03.760 --> 58:09.680
lead also to a destabilization of the AMOC. Because if that basically is the order, because

58:09.680 --> 58:14.560
we have a lot of freshwater then melted on Greenland and flowing into the sub-Polynorth Atlantic,

58:14.560 --> 58:20.240
and I explained already how this can slow down the AMOC. So, yeah, but it shows that the whole

58:20.240 --> 58:26.560
Earth system is linked. And when we have those major effects happening, more can follow.

58:27.120 --> 58:32.400
You may be too young, and I don't know what TV shows there were in Germany when you were growing

58:32.400 --> 58:37.760
up. But do you ever get the feeling that this is all part of some Twilight Zone episode that

58:37.760 --> 58:45.280
we're describing this, the biogeochemical cycles of the planet that you and I are alive on.

58:45.920 --> 58:53.600
And we're talking about like major Earth system changes happening on our watch. Doesn't that just

58:53.600 --> 59:02.480
blow you away at times and not in a good way? Yes, actually, yes. And I think it feels so strange

59:02.560 --> 59:09.440
that as humans, I mean, an individual human is very small and in a way, I don't want to insult

59:09.440 --> 59:15.200
anybody but insignificant. And for example, when I go out on the North Atlantic on a research

59:15.200 --> 59:22.400
vessel and you are out on the ocean, then there's huge water masses, so much power around you,

59:22.400 --> 59:28.320
so much energy. And also when we look, I mean, I talked about the volume transport by the AMOC,

59:28.320 --> 59:33.360
that's huge, that's nothing we can do basically in terms of engineering. So I had actually people

59:33.360 --> 59:38.320
contacted me saying, can't we put some kind of robots into the water and move the AMOC

59:38.320 --> 59:45.360
ourselves? No, we can't because that's way too much. That is so huge the system that we can't do

59:45.360 --> 59:52.400
that physically. And yet we are actually messing with the system by something as burning coal,

59:52.400 --> 01:00:00.480
by putting CO2 into the atmosphere, so by actually doing, affecting even tinier particles. And it

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:08.880
feels very wrong, very scary, I guess, trying to be optimistic. Okay, it shows that we can

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:17.520
actually affect the system a lot. But yeah, it feels like we are playing with something and we

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:25.840
don't know the rules. And we can talk about this. I'm a science communicator and I know that people

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:32.320
that follow this channel are very fluent in these issues, but relative to the general public,

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:41.360
the AMOC and ocean risks are relatively unknown, especially in my country. What about in the

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:48.400
scientific community? Is there increasing consensus among your colleagues on the AMOC and

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:55.840
climate and scenarios going forward? Or is there still quite a bit of disagreement on the broader

01:00:55.840 --> 01:01:04.000
trends? There's certainly an increased amount of consensus. So when I basically did my PhD and

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:09.920
I published my first paper on an AMOC slowdown, there were quite a few scientists who made the

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:17.120
point to me that there are other explanations for the signals that we are seeing. And I mean,

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:24.000
the difficulty here is, I mentioned the real like direct ABIC measurements continue started in 2004.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.520
So to know what happened over the last century, we have to look at what we call proxy data.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:36.320
So other climate variables that we can measure that we know are related to the AMOC and then kind

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:42.000
of deduce the AMOC evolution from them. And I worked with my PhD supervisor Stefan Ramstof on

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.440
looking at the sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. And there are a lot of reasons

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.080
why we know that they're linked to the AMOC. But of course, they are also influenced by other

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.680
things. For example, an increase in wind strength could cool the North Atlantic

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:02.480
as would an AMOC slowdown. And while there was no one in the scientific community who said,

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:08.800
you must be wrong because of that, there were a lot of people saying, well, but it could also be

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:13.200
a change in the wind system. We don't know that yet. We don't have the data to support that.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:19.120
But you can't be 100% sure. And I mean, that's true. I would say in all of climate scientists,

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.640
we basically are never 100% sure because that's not how science works. We basically,

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:29.920
we make an assumption, we look at the data and we try to explain all the data that we have,

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:35.520
according to that assumptions. And if we find something that is basically disproving what

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.360
we thought first, then we have to find a new assumption. This has changed because there

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:46.080
have been more and more publications that indicated an AMOC slowdown and none that showed

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:51.120
the opposite. There's still some data where we are, okay, this is interesting. We can't completely

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:59.120
complain that yet. But with that, the consensus is definitely increasing. I think one problem

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.920
is also just the way the science community works as a whole. So it's not that there's one publication

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.320
about something and everybody's, oh yeah, now we're going to believe that. It's more like, oh,

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:16.400
interesting. Now let's wait a little bit, see what other research groups are publishing on that,

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:22.000
test that. I mean, that's good. That's how we can make sure that we are not basically following

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.360
some random group, but that we're really getting to enhance our knowledge. But it also makes a little

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:34.400
bit slow and maybe with regards to climate change too slow. It's so complex. And I'm sure you deal

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:45.280
with ocean AMOC experts in your paper writing and your job. But then there's Arctic climate

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:54.320
specialists and cloud physicists. And there's all sorts of different disciplines within the

01:03:54.320 --> 01:04:00.000
climate discipline itself. And how do you all meet at conferences and compare notes on things

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:05.760
that you're not experts in that someone else is? What's your experience there?

01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:14.720
My experience is that the different disciplines are too siloed, basically, so then don't talk

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:21.120
enough to each other. And I think it's not just a problem with within the disciplines, but also

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:27.360
with the way science is being done at the moment, that it's really pressed towards publications.

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:32.080
As a young researcher, I know basically I'm being measured by the amount of first author and second

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:37.120
author publications that they have. Because of that, too many papers are being published and no

01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:42.480
one can read all of that. But to publish a paper, you have to find something new. And I think what

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:48.400
we really have to do more is actually synthesizing the data that is out there, the publications

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:58.480
that are out there. Yeah. So tell me about your work. Where do you work? What do you do? And if

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:05.600
you and your team are successful, what do you hope to accomplish? Yeah, here I have to admit that

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:13.360
basically, I kind of left the AMO community, the very small AMO, not small, but the focused AMO

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:17.920
community. Because of the experience I made in the last years, that basically,

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:25.040
the AMO is a topic that is able to raise attention, maybe also because of this movie,

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.360
The Day After Tomorrow, and at least in Europe, a lot of people know about the Go stream and the

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:36.480
importance. But there are so many things happening when we look at the increase in extreme weather

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:45.280
events, when we look at flooding. And I feel that the increase in fires, so many things related

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:51.600
to climate change that happen on a way faster time scales than the AMO and that have a big

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:58.160
effect right now, that I basically went to my former institute, the Potsam Institute for Climate

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.960
Impact Research, and now work with Johann Rockström on the planetary boundary framework,

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:08.000
which is highlighting actually this global approach and the synthesizing approach, saying

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:14.160
it's not enough to just look at one special corner or area. And I mean, this is actually going

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.760
further, saying, okay, not just AMO is enough, not even just climate change is enough to really

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:25.760
have to look at the earth system, and looking at all its components, looking at the biosphere

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.560
integrity and basically how the biosphere is right now functioning in our favor, because that is

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:36.720
also taking up a lot of carbon, how it's basically working in terms of the radiation budget. And I

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:44.480
just feel that we know so much that we can do that would improve the lives of so many people on earth

01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:50.800
in terms of, of course, reducing CO2, but also living more sustainable, changing our diets

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:57.760
towards more plant based, that I just wanted to work on that. And I think the problem is in getting

01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:04.400
people to act that most want numbers and certainty, and we can't give 100% certainty yet, and we can't

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:11.680
give like the exact numbers, but we can give with 99% 0.9 certainty the direction that we have to go.

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.200
And I just want to press that and work on the science there.

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:24.800
This is an interesting thing, because if we stop this conversation now, you have outlined

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:33.200
scientifically, credibly, in some detail how the AMOC works, and my viewers will have learned about

01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:38.560
that. There's a wide variety of viewers that follow this channel, because we cover all the

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:45.440
aspects of the human predicament. But once we go into what should we do about it, I'm sure you have

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:54.320
some suggestions, then once we talk about prescriptions, then some people no longer believe

01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.160
the scientific description. And I'm not talking about you, I'm just talking about generally in

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:06.160
the world, there is the explanation of the issue, and there's the what to do about it,

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.440
and they confound each other. Have you experienced that?

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:18.080
Yes. And I mean, I'm not 100% surprised by it, because it often seems to be human nature,

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:25.680
right, that we find it really difficult to change. And I mean, when I look, we look at our everyday

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.160
lives, I guess most people know basically what would be best for their own health in terms of

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:36.400
exercise, diet, and so on. But they seem to be not to be able to do what's best for them in the

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:41.600
long term. I guess short term, I can basically say, okay, I want to eat this right now. So I do

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:47.520
it because it makes me happy. And so it's not surprising that when it comes to this even bigger

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.440
and more longer term issue, that of course, we are not able to choose what's best for us in the

01:08:53.440 --> 01:09:01.920
long term. But it's also really, really frustrating. I think if 10 or 20 or 30% of people chose the

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:09.120
better path for climate, there would be a social primate pressure to do that. But since it's

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.760
someone else's problem, and in the future so far, we have not, we've not done that. Plus, we are

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:23.040
individual humans as part of this globally connected emergent energy, hungry,

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:34.000
pseudo organism that has a life of its own. So climate is a real problem for this situation. And

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:42.080
the only antidote that I can think of is more conversations like this that act as a facilitator

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:46.960
between our current behaviors and our mental understanding of the future.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:54.400
I agree. I think that the best way still to basically facility or induce change is to explain

01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.080
things, to understand things. Because if it's difficult to change, then we will only change

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:05.520
if we really get the reason. So earlier you said, and I happen to agree with you,

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:14.720
that we're going to do business as usual, make a few little benign tweaks on the margins,

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:26.320
but not do anything major until we see the temperature, precipitation, ecological impacts

01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:30.320
are horrifying. And then we're going to try to do something radical

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:37.520
at the last minute. Do you have any speculation on what some of those radical interventions might be?

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:46.080
Oh, I don't know yet, because I guess it's kind of like a path I don't really want to go down in

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:51.280
my mind. I mean, the thing is, of course, that there are, as far as I know, they're not like real

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:56.640
international laws on what kind of climate or geoengineering is allowed or not. So I'm afraid

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.560
that some people might be thinking, oh, cool, now we put a lot of air results into the atmosphere

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:07.680
because that at least has a cooling effect for a few years. I know that I think, I mean,

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:14.560
those ideas have been tested in climate models and basically run through and none of them

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:21.200
seems to be promising for the moment. So I would say that anything radical that we do is probably

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:29.840
not going to be wise. So could you offer any non radical suggestions to our viewers,

01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:38.320
either as individuals or as parts of institutions that create policies? And, you know, my view is

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:48.480
Germany or the United States can't just be climate friendly policies and go to the Paris Accord

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:54.640
agreements. It's a global, you know, the CO2 is not recognized national borders. I mean,

01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:03.760
it's a global thing. So what sort of recommendations do you have to avert some of the

01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.520
default paths that we're currently on with the AMOC and with the global climate system?

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:14.800
I mean, in principle, it is very simple. First of all, we really have to get our CO2 emissions

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:20.640
down. And I think personally, that means on the one hand side, I would really encourage people to

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:28.000
basically look at the political party that they support. And this topic should be in there. And

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:33.280
I mean, I'm not basically, for me, it's not really important whether otherwise what kind of

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:39.200
faction you support and whether you like our fan of capitalism or free markets or whatever,

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.560
the climate topic should be in there no matter what the party is, because that's non-negotiable.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:50.240
And that's nothing we can basically, we can't talk to the climate system or to the earth system and

01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:54.800
say, Hey, now we're going to pay you this amount of money and you're not going to change. So that's

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.920
important. And please stress that no matter what you otherwise basically stand for believe in.

01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:07.520
And then the other thing is also be skeptical, I think, because we like easy solutions. But

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:12.560
normally the easy solutions is not the best solution. And I think that's just something

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.280
most of us know, right? If we work hard for something, normally it stays longer,

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:22.400
basically what I gain in a minute, I can often lose very soon also, what I gain with hard work

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:28.880
over years, that stays. And I think so with that, be okay with that, it's going to be hard, but it's

01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:34.080
not going to be negative. A lot of the decisions or changes that we have to make, as I already mentioned,

01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:39.760
would also be good for ourselves. I mean, we do know that a plant based diet is better for most

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:45.760
of our health. And that basically cycling a lot. I mean, who wants to sit in a car all day and drive

01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:51.200
around? Maybe a few people do, but and that's okay too. I think kind of try to find the changes

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:58.560
that are okay with you. Nobody has to change their life completely. But we can all make changes that

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:05.040
basically make our lives more sustainable. And I think that's also important to like really

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:10.800
take care of that and do the effort and don't do it for somebody else, but basically do it

01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:17.280
because it's the right thing to do. That makes sense. It does make sense. But as I said, climate

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:25.040
is a global issue and we've got India planning to double coal production in their country by the

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.760
year 2030. And you can understand why they want to do that because they're going to have higher

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:36.240
temperatures and they need more air conditioning and cooling for their population. So there is

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.360
individual recommendations and I agree with the ones that you laid out, but there's got to be some

01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:50.720
sort of global plan and there isn't and I know why there isn't. So is there any hope in the

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:57.120
international scope of things that you and your colleagues have? I think these COP meetings so

01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:05.600
far have been a real disappointment. They have no teeth. And I think the difficult questions are not

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:11.680
askable with all these high status men and women from around the world because they don't like

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:19.440
truth to power sort of questions. Yeah, that's a very good question. And I have to say basically

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:27.840
there's a reason why I'm not in policy because I like honesty and I like being direct and I can't

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:34.320
deal with people who try to tell me something by I don't know going around the issue and telling me

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:40.720
something else. And with that I'm also very frustrated and I think honestly that this

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:47.040
lying on a like lying on that level on an international level and with lying I'm also

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:53.280
meaning that if you like draw attention away from the truth or you hide some fact that should be

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:59.280
really punishable I think because it is misleading and it's hurting so many people. I'm also hopeful

01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:06.240
because I've actually met a few people that are active in policy and that have great ideas and that

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:12.880
are really really enthusiastic and engaged in trying to protect others those who can't protect

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.640
themselves. But of course I do see that we are not really getting closer to a solution right now

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:24.960
and I honestly don't know how to change that how to help that. I think we if there are people out

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:30.000
there who know that their strength is to influence other people basically and to get them to basically

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:35.200
do what you want them to do then please use it for good that's what I'm asking you. I can only

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:40.000
give you the facts but we see that delivering the facts is not enough right that's what we've seen

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:46.720
that that's not enough we kind of need some kind of climate lobby where we really say hey people

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:53.840
this is what you have to do. Maybe we need effectivists instead of activists. So let me let me ask

01:16:53.840 --> 01:17:01.200
you a personal question. You're obviously very knowledgeable and passionate about this topic

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.720
as you should be because this is the topic of our times well one of the the core ones anyways.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:16.480
How do you manage being all in as you clearly are on ocean issues planetary boundaries where

01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:23.920
we're headed and then have a normal life and have a cheeseburger or strudel or whatever whatever

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:29.680
you eat there with your high school friends and and your family how do you live in both worlds

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:39.040
because I struggle to be honest in in in my life with with that. Yeah I do too and I guess I mean

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:43.840
I'm not completely sure what I'm leading a normal life compared to everyone else. I would say that

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:50.240
when I look among my amongst my friends most of them basically support the same things I support

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.040
so I'm really living in a little bit of a bubble and most of them really try to be as sustainable

01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.520
as possible. I think it would be difficult otherwise it's something that I do see with

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:04.880
family with I mean you don't choose your family right you are born into it and there I'm having

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:11.360
sometimes complicated or complicated discussions and sometimes I just yeah decide not to discuss

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:18.320
certain things and in other terms I mean I have to admit say that this kind of is also affecting

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:24.560
basically how I plan my life and I do see that basically I would say the goals and dreams that

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:30.640
my parents have given me and kind of saying hey when you are I'm 34 right now so I should probably

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:38.000
have two kids a husband and a house and basically I have a partner fiance I'm very happy with but

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:45.760
we never plan on getting a house because that's not really I think realistic achievable for most

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:50.400
people so I guess that of course but some people can have their own house in their own place but

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:55.840
when we look at the number of people we have on the planet our limited resources then not everyone

01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.360
can have a house actually most people can't have their own house and it's also really when we think

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:06.640
about okay do we want or not have children do I want to put my children into this kind of world

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:12.320
will I be able to adequately protect them with what's coming in the future these are things

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.840
I'm discussing with my my partner and with my friends because it's yeah it's not just about

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:23.440
what is my own happiness basically and do I give on my genes to the next generation

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:31.200
we certainly know that in terms of population we don't need every one of us to get a child

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:38.640
so we are enough people on the planet and of course in terms of resources not having a child

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:43.280
is way smarter than having one which is not saying that nobody should have children of

01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:50.160
course if you but it's something that I think is in there I know of those things I know of

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:55.680
the limited resources and I can't forget it when I basically enter my private life what I

01:19:55.680 --> 01:20:03.680
learn or do during my work time so I struggle as you long ago I chose not to have children

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:11.120
genetic children you and I both have cultural children in a way with the young people that we

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:17.520
influence with these ideas and I have ducks and and dogs which also eat resources but

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.840
that's the path I chose so let me ask you one more scientific question and then I'll get to the

01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.840
closing questions that I ask all my guests would it be fair for me to say that this year

01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:38.800
will be the coolest year of the rest of my life on average of course there could be El Nino and

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:43.840
La Nina and other things but is that a fair assessment to make given what we know about

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:50.640
the inertia of the climate system? Sort of I mean you just chose basically an El Nino year which

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:57.040
of course we know is a global average a higher temperature so I very much hope that the next

01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:02.640
two, three, four years will be on average a little bit cooler again but in terms of course

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:10.080
of the long-term trends yes so basically I wouldn't see like a large scale cooling signal

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.120
is not going to happen within the next decades even if we would stop all emissions right now so

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:24.400
yeah but yeah thank you that's my understanding as well but I wanted to back it up with a

01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:30.640
climate scientist and I will have Johan your colleague on in the near future he was supposed

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:40.480
to be on tomorrow but we had to we had to reschedule it so Lev K I really I really like you and I

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:48.160
respect what you're doing and I feel the the passion and frustration bubbling just under

01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:55.280
the surface because this isn't our fault what's happening but you and I were born on this planet

01:21:55.280 --> 01:22:03.680
as humans during this time of the carbon pulse and looking around us and figuring it out is

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:09.920
someone's job and I'm glad that you're doing it so do you have any personal advice you just

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:17.680
mentioned about houses and children but do you have any personal advice for the listeners of this

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:24.080
show that are hearing what you're saying and concerned about the future what what sort of advice

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:30.480
do you have for the listeners I would say on the one hand side kind of be creative in your dream

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:37.120
I kind of mentioned that we don't have to have the same goals in terms of having or becoming rich

01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:44.320
having our own house or having to basically fly have a vacation somewhere fancy tropical every year

01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.320
because that's what doesn't tell you what makes you happy so really like listen

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:54.320
in your inner self basically what really does make you happy because I think most of the stuff

01:22:54.320 --> 01:23:00.720
that makes you happy can be very sustainable and totally fine and be done within the earth resources

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:09.680
but then the other thing is I still believe and try to act under the assumption that humans are

01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:15.840
good and that nobody really wants to be a bad person or tries to harm others I mean there might

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:22.560
be a few exceptions but I think most people even if they actually do something right now that is

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:28.240
causing a lot of emissions and harm to the environment they have a reason that can probably

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:34.080
be understood by us because there is a reason in their reasoning why they're doing this and why

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:39.360
it's a good thing to do and so it would be good of course we have to educate those people and we

01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:46.960
have to try to change them but we shouldn't like make them to monsters and we should act in the way

01:23:46.960 --> 01:23:54.400
saying hey okay I see what you're doing this is how it's like this how why I don't like what you're

01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:59.280
doing because it's hurting this and this person can you explain to me why we're doing it and maybe

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:05.600
we can find a solution together so I think that's important to also just stay optimistic and to like

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:11.920
life and also because I really believe it's true so most people I talk to when they do something

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:17.200
like how can you do that then they explain it to me I'm like oh okay and now it makes sense but hey

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.360
there's actually a different way of how you can do this which is way better for the environment

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.720
and for everyone and how would you change that advice for the young people watching the show

01:24:26.720 --> 01:24:32.160
and their teens or 20s who are becoming aware of all this and they have a whole lifetime ahead of them

01:24:33.840 --> 01:24:42.000
that's a very good question and I would say I'm not completely sure what I would say I would

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:49.600
probably apologize for not for not having taken better care of their world so far I mean and I'm

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:57.120
still fairly young I would try to I would say be bold basically just because you're young and it

01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:02.480
feels like you might know less and that's something I experience as actually as a scientist so I mean

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:08.720
I'm talking to colleagues who have 20 or more years experience than I have in the topic and sometimes

01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:14.080
still they I see that they make mistakes and it just takes me more longer to be brave about that

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:20.640
and say hey no I'm studying this too and you might have more experience but I put a lot of time in

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:25.760
this and I know I'm right and I think that's also what the young people is when you feel something

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:35.440
is not right be brave about it be bold about it and change and otherwise probably also be hopeful

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:41.920
find your own future but in general I have to say it does it's hard for me it's hard for me to be

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:47.600
like completely optimistic towards a person who has I don't know 70 80 year ahead of them because

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:52.640
I know that life is going to change quite a bit during that time so this is a question I ask all

01:25:52.640 --> 01:26:00.880
my guests and I think you may have subliminally through your things that you've left unsaid have

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:07.280
given the answer but what do you care most about in the world Lefke it's probably a fair and honest

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:16.800
world so I think that this is what bugs me most about I guess this topic is that the main people

01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:24.320
who are causing the problems are not the ones that are suffering the most and that's just not

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:32.640
what I like so it's really the fairness and the main non-humans are going to suffer as well

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.640
that's a very good point yes yeah so if you could wave a magic wand what is one thing you might do

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:45.280
to change human and planetary futures if there was no personal risk to yourself

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:52.720
kind of depends on on the limit I mean if I could basically change the climate system the earth system

01:26:52.720 --> 01:26:59.120
back to a pre-industrial state and fix it in that way that no matter what we do we we couldn't

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:05.360
change it as humans that would of course be a safe way although maybe we wouldn't then learn

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:10.960
I think if it comes to the human mind as I said I would really like us to be able to make the

01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:17.120
advice's decision to be objective look at the facts and then decide what we do based on them

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:25.680
and what we want to happen and not based on this weird mix of emotion fear maybe favors

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:33.520
yeah so that I think would already bring us a very big step further towards a sustainable future

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:42.640
thank you if I were to have you back on the show which I would love to what is one topic

01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:50.480
in your broader work that isn't a broad overview but is a very specific topic that you think is

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:55.200
relevant to our future that you would be willing to talk about in depth

01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:04.000
the next time well given my my location better my job right now it would really be about the link

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:11.040
of the climate system towards the rest of the earth system towards with the land system with

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:18.480
species diversity and how all of this is basically connected but from a scientific point of view so

01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:24.320
not from a like spherical point of view mother earth but really we see so much scientific evidence

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:30.480
for that and I would love to talk about that excellent any closing words for our viewers

01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.920
and listeners lefka I guess honestly if they listened until this point then I would thank them

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:43.600
for being so interested in the science because yeah I know it's a complicated topic and I

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:49.200
know that it's hard to understand and I mean I've been doing this for 10 years nearly and

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.160
I'm still learning new stuff so yeah thank you for your openness to learn about these things for

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.040
your willingness hopefully to change that means a lot and that's I think what the world needs

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:04.800
thank you so much for your time today lefka and for your important work on this issue to be continued

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:12.800
