0	15000	Greetings! In between watching presentations at the Beyond Growth Conference today, I went out with my dogs in the woods and I found more cellar mushrooms finally.
15000	28000	So it was a good day. Back to the degrowth presentation, kicked off by no other than the president of the European Commission and she had this to say.
28000	39000	I want today to concentrate on one point and that is a point that the report got right beyond any doubt.
39000	49000	That is the clear message that a growth model centered on fossil fuels is simply obsolete.
49000	63000	I wouldn't have believed that the head of the EU commission would have said this five years ago, even three years ago.
63000	73000	COVID in the Ukraine war has allowed some partial story of our truth to be able to be politically spoken.
73000	81000	Of course, notice she did not say that growth is obsolete, but that growth and fossil fuels are obsolete.
81000	87000	So I wanted to have a few reflections on degrowth and beyond growth.
87000	93000	At least eight of my former podcast guests were in that room.
93000	103000	Vandana Shiva, George Oscalis, Timote Parikh, Olivia Lazard, Simon Michaud, K Rayworth is soon going to be on the show.
103000	111000	This is my tribe. These are the humans that I relate to and I have a lot in common with them.
111000	121000	I do not consider myself a degrother because I think there are some fundamental flaws in the logic of how they look at financial and energy systems.
121000	133000	But that doesn't mean that I don't relate to them and they are caring about a better future, more equality, environmental protection, well-being of citizens,
133000	140000	instead of outsourcing our decision-makings to the market and de facto destroying the planet.
140000	158000	So when we approach these issues, there are three things. One, we have to care and understand.
158000	166000	Two is we have to have a destination, something that's sustainable, something that's feasible, something that's desirable.
166000	171000	I think that's a lot of what the Beyond Growth Conference and the degrowth movement is about.
171000	183000	The third, and this is what's really lacking in my opinion, is a map of how to get there from here in a very overleveraged financial system,
183000	193000	in a fragile geopolitical system, in a consumption-addicted, polarized society.
193000	211000	Anything that hits the system of any magnitude, de-dolarization, an escalation including nukes in Russia, game moves by China away from pricing things in U.S. dollars,
212000	223000	any exogenous event triggers this 350 to 400% debt to GDP rubber band snapback.
223000	238000	The U.S. alone, even though we're over 90% energy independent, we now have $32 trillion in debt and we have almost $200 trillion in unfunded pensions and social security.
238000	251000	We are insolvent as a global system, and so the first problem I have with the degrowth movement is they don't integrate the Wiley Coyote financial overhang that exists in Europe,
251000	256000	in the U.S. and the U.K. and Japan, the total global north.
256000	265000	We are growing our debt way faster than we're growing our GDP, which is the income stream needed to support the debt.
265000	275000	Any number of things could trigger this rapid reduction in the complexity built because of our financial claims on reality.
275000	281000	That needs to be more incorporated because otherwise it's just, this is what we wish to happen.
281000	289000	Secondly is the idea of instantaneous contraction and convergence of a global wealth transfer.
290000	294000	Global wealth transfer could happen in two ways from the global north and global south.
294000	311000	And again, I am not dismissing the necessity and the moral state of this occurring because the global north is responsible for 80% of the emissions and the environmental destruction
311000	318000	and historical, uneven, unfair colonial practices, etc.
318000	319000	I get it.
319000	328000	But to just naively say that we're going to transfer this wealth to the global south is, first of all, politically impractical.
328000	329000	It's just not going to happen.
329000	335000	There are already riots in France because of extending the retirement age as one example.
335000	338000	But let's just assume it was politically possible.
339000	354000	Number two is a trillion dollars of money moving from the United States to Bangladesh or Madagascar, for example, has a much different impact on the world than that trillion staying in the US.
354000	357000	It will not be spent on Netflix subscriptions.
357000	369000	So in the same way that in the wealth and income inequality in the United States, the top 1% of income earners spend 7% of their income.
369000	377000	The bottom two quintiles, the bottom 40% of earners in the United States spend 104% of their income.
377000	379000	They spend everything.
379000	392000	So, for example, a trillion dollar wealth transfer to the global south would be an immediate call on more coal, more oil, more copper and more infrastructure.
392000	399000	So that is already a drain on the ecology and the scarce resources in the planet.
399000	410000	But perhaps more importantly is a functional wealth transfer beyond a couple percent can't physically happen.
410000	423000	It would be like having a car has a lot of components like an engine and a gas tank and an emission, and you can't piecemeal that out because if you have a half of a car, the entire car doesn't work.
423000	437000	So in our global system in Europe in the United States, you can't send a material amount of wealth without running into something called a functionality threshold.
437000	446000	Beyond a few percent, the functionality happens to drop from 95, 94, 93 to 20 or zero.
447000	450000	So there is a metabolism.
450000	464000	There is Kleber's law, power laws, the maximum power principle, these things, natural biological scaling laws, these things can be applied to human systems.
464000	469000	And you can't just disrupt that volitionally.
469000	492000	Lastly, my comment about the degrowth movement is as intense and scary as it sounds is those countries that do have to degrow first because of unaffordability or systemic risk or the natural gas pipelines from Russia don't come in the winter of 23, 24.
493000	501000	That's going to be painful. That's going to be chaotic, but it may be an opportunity to be resilient first.
501000	523000	Those nations that have to figure this out while the rest of the global system stays intact may have like a tortoise and hare sort of advantage relative to the United States, which is more energy independent, but perhaps less resilient, more polarized, addicted, etc.
523000	527000	So degrowth is what should happen.
527000	530000	Post growth is what's going to happen.
530000	542000	Those countries that have to deal with the end of growth first may have first mover advantages in a weird sort of way.
542000	552000	Lastly, I would just like to congratulate and support the people at this conference because despite some of the naive attes I've pointed out, it's the only game in town.
552000	556000	They are exploring this. They are trying these things.
556000	578000	And I think the degrowth movement needs to be integrated with a systems ecology movement that looks at the entire human system, finance, energy, metabolism, human behavior, aggregate political systems, governance, etc.
578000	580000	And widen the conversation.
580000	593000	So I'm in support of my friends that are in Europe right now in Brussels talking about beyond growth with some caveats that I don't think it's going to manifest the way that they are describing.
593000	598000	But the conversation is happening and I am very happy about that.
598000	602000	And we're going to have more on this channel discussing this.
602000	605000	I got several emails from people who sent me pictures.
605000	611000	Nate, I'm at the Beyond Growth conference. There's a guy in Poland next to me and he says he listens to your podcast.
611000	613000	I got like a bunch of those.
613000	618000	So let's continue this conversation. Thank you. I'll talk to you next week.
632000	634000	Thank you.
