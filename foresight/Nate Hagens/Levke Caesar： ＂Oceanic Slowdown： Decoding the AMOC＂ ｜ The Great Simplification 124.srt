1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,640
We know that the AMOG is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,680
We see from paleo data evidences that it might have happened before.

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:18,320
And we are not really much closer to knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing,

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,280
in terms of how much degree of global warming would be okay before the AMOG could collapse

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:27,840
than we were like 20, 30 years ago, even though we know much more.

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:37,040
Today's conversation is with Climate Physicist Levka Caesar.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,480
Levka works at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Potsdam, Germany. Her current

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:53,440
work primarily focuses on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, aka the AMOG, and its

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,440
pivotal role in our climate system. Levka's research has produced seminal work on the past

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,960
evolution of this important ocean current. In October of 2023, she also assumed the role of

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,520
scientific lead for the newly launched Planetary Boundary Science Initiative at the Potsdam

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,240
Institute. This conversation was a deep dive on all things AMOG, what we know, what we don't know,

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,880
and what speculations are for the future of this critical component of our planetary systems.

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,640
Please welcome Levka Caesar. Levka, great to see you.

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,760
Yeah, great to talk to you, Nate. Thanks for inviting me.

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:45,840
You are welcome. So usually when I host guests, I have their location on my globe, but since we're

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,480
going to be talking about the AMOG, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation of the Atlantic

18
00:01:52,480 --> 00:02:01,680
Ocean, I highlighted the Atlantic Ocean as the theme location of the podcast. So you are a world

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,880
renowned expert on ocean issues, especially the AMOG, and that's going to be the topic of our

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,600
deep dive today. But let me first ask you this. How old were you, and what were you thinking

21
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,160
when you first decided I want to be a scientist studying how Earth's natural systems work?

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,920
That's a very interesting question because I have to admit I'm actually coming from the space

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,440
science side. So when I was young, and I think even at the age of like eight, nine, I was really

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,200
interested in the formation of black holes, the life cycle of stars. Then I had a period when I

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,920
wanted to become an astronaut, and that basically sparked me to study physics, and it was then

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,960
later during my studies that I kind of realized I want to do something that's closer to home and

27
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:59,200
that feels a little bit more relevant. So I still really believe that astrophysics is really cool,

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,080
and I don't know, physicists might call it sexy in terms of the data, the mechanisms, but yeah,

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,440
I guess I was in about like 22 when I really did my bachelor's in physics that I realized

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,320
physics can also be applied to our planet, to the Earth system, and can explain so many interesting

31
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:25,200
and relevant phenomena, whether the ocean circulations that, yeah, basically then when I

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:33,840
decided to shift my focus. Excellent. I shifted my focus when I was on Wall Street and realized

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:41,120
that the externalities were not included in our prices, and we were in for a phase shift during

34
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:50,160
my lifetime of the ecology and natural systems on Earth. So as you're well aware, global heating

35
00:03:50,160 --> 00:04:00,320
is in the news. Lots of people are worried and aware of climate change. Oceans are a very integral

36
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:08,000
part of the climate system, but they don't get as much coverage in the news. There are multiple

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,320
ocean risk that we face, ocean acidification, decline in oxygen content, sea level rise,

38
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,000
overfishing, lots of different aspects. But what we're going to talk about today is the ocean

39
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,680
currents and how they change and how they may be changing in the near and distant future. So can

40
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:37,520
you start us off by describing what the AMOCK is and how critical it is to the function of climate

41
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:45,280
as we know it today? Yes, sure. So the AMOCK, which is short for Atlantic Meridional Overturning

42
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Circulation, and I like that name, even though I guess for a lot of people it's kind of difficult to

43
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,040
say it first, but it's actually a good description of what the system is. So the AMOCK is a system

44
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:06,240
of ocean currents, covering the Atlantic, therefore Atlantic Meridional, because that's the geological

45
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,080
term basically for saying something is moving in the north-south direction. And while the AMOCK is

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,680
basically, when depending on where you look, moving in any direction, the main transport is on the

47
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:25,680
north-south line. So the AMOCK is transporting a lot of warm saline water at or just below the surface

48
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:31,040
of the ocean northward in the Atlantic. It's really coming even from the southern ocean,

49
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,120
so it's really transporting the whole length of the Atlantic, these water masses, and then as

50
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:45,520
basically it's going over the equator through the tropics and then entering the colder subpolar

51
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:52,000
north Atlantic region. And basically with that it's coming into regions of colder air masses

52
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,520
above the surface of the ocean and a lot of this heat is then being transported or basically

53
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,400
released to the atmosphere. The water, the surface water is cooling down and cold water is denser

54
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,320
compared to warmer water and this is then basically leading to a sinking of the water masses, which

55
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,960
we call convection in physical terms basically. And these water masses then that are sinking

56
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,440
down in the subpolar north Atlantic. And while the locations are the Erminger Sea, the Nordic Seas,

57
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,240
the Leoparder Sea, but I guess if you're not an oceanographer, then probably you wouldn't know

58
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,320
what these ocean regions are called. So it's basically around the Greenland ice sheet, so to

59
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,600
the south of it, to the east of it, and there you have those places of this deep water formation.

60
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,760
So the sinking of surface water masses that are being cooled down by the atmosphere, getting denser,

61
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,720
getting heavier, and then are going to deeper ocean layers. And when I say deeper, I mean

62
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,360
depths of two to three kilometers. And then these water masses together from the southward return

63
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,480
flow of the AMOC, now transporting colder water southward at depths towards basically back towards

64
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,200
the equator region. And it's mainly this exchange of warm surface water going towards the subpolar

65
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,720
region and colder, deeper water going back, that leads to a lot of energy transport by the AMOC.

66
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,240
Okay, let me let me pause you there for a little bit of history. And I'm going to pretend that I

67
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:32,640
don't know much about this, which I don't really have to pretend much. We've had the AMOC current

68
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:40,000
forever, or since there were seven continents, right? I mean, we've been aware of this and able

69
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
to look back in time. And this current that you described has been there for a long time, right?

70
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,200
It has been there for a long time. Forever is probably difficult to say.

71
00:07:54,480 --> 00:08:02,480
But yeah. And is this a new, I know there's a new paper out by your colleagues, I believe,

72
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:11,360
and yourself, on the risks that the AMOC poses in the near future. But is awareness of this

73
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,520
current? Is this a relatively new thing? Or is scientists known about this for a long time?

74
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,240
Actually, no, there are, within the scientific community, this kind of starts with Henry Stommel,

75
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,960
who's one of, yeah, famous oceanographer, who already in the 60s basically assessed that this

76
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,600
overturning circulation, which first of all is special to the Atlantic, so we do not have this

77
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,000
kind of overturning circulation in the Pacific, that it exists, that it's very special in the

78
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,600
sense that normally when we look at either ocean currents or atmospheric currents, they would always

79
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,280
transport heat from the tropics to the polar regions, because basically the sun is heating the

80
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,000
earth in the sense we have most of the radiation going towards the tropics and then less towards

81
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,120
the polar regions. And as is usually the case, basically the systems thrive towards

82
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,040
distributing the heat more homogeneously. So basically, when you have a lot of heating at

83
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,240
one place and no heating at the others, you have a movement of either water or air masses

84
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,800
from the heated region to the colder regions. But the AMOC is special because it can actually

85
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,960
transport heat above the equator. It's transporting heat from the southern to the northern hemisphere.

86
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,680
And that makes it really special. And that the system is there, basically, and why it can be

87
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,040
there, which is like a delicate balance, basically of freshwater, saline water, heating and cooling

88
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,200
in the Atlantic. That is something that has been known, as I said, for several decades now.

89
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,760
And also an understanding of the mechanism that it doesn't have to be there, so that in principle

90
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,480
it's possible that there is no AMOC, or theoretically we could even say the AMOC could be flowing the

91
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:06,640
other way around. So as I said, we have a northward surface flow and a southward deep flow. We could

92
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,480
also have a circulation in the Atlantic where we have a southward surface flow, deep water formation

93
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,680
basically in the southern ocean, and then a northward deep water return flow. But that's not

94
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,040
the case. The way, basically, our earth system is set right now through the fact that we have

95
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,720
the heating in the tropics, we have then evaporation of water masses, of the warm water masses in the

96
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:35,360
tropics, and more precipitation rainfall in the north Atlantic. This balance is basically

97
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,960
played out at the moment that we have the AMOC as it is flowing today with the northward surface flow.

98
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:50,160
Okay, so I'm going to jump around here, but give us the punchline first and then we'll backfill from

99
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,720
there. What is happening to the AMOC now and what are the risks or the scenarios you see in

100
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:04,080
coming decades or centuries or millennia based on what's already built in?

101
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,600
Yeah, so what we see now is basically a slowdown of this circulation system, very simply said.

102
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,360
And while scientifically it's always a little bit difficult to give exact numbers, everything

103
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:26,160
hints towards a slowdown of about 15% over the last few decades. And again, it's more difficult to

104
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,360
say why something is happening compared to then just observing it and saying it is happening,

105
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,960
but we do understand under which circumstances, what are the mechanisms that could drive such a

106
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:43,280
slowdown. And this is mainly related to a freshwater influx into the sub-poller north Atlantic.

107
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,800
So I already kind of said that what is driving this ocean circulation is really a formation of

108
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,960
deeper water masses, a sinking of water masses in the sub-poller north Atlantic around Greenland.

109
00:11:54,960 --> 00:12:00,160
And then basically when you have water sinking at some place, you have to have an inflow at the

110
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,440
surface that is kind of filling this gap just due to volume conservation. And then this deep water

111
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,960
has to go somewhere. And basically with how the earth is set, the rotation of the earth,

112
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:17,120
the way it is basically that we have a southward deep water flow and then this surface northward

113
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,800
flow. But if we now put a lot of freshwater into the sub-poller north Atlantic, what is happening

114
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:31,040
is that the surface water there get lighter, less dense. This is because the density of ocean water

115
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,200
depends on two things, the temperature, which I already mentioned, colder water being denser

116
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,880
than light water, but also the salinity. And here I guess it also makes a lot of sense if I put more

117
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,880
salt, more matter into something, I make it heavier and denser. Now if we put a lot of very

118
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,800
fresh water, so no salinity basically into the sub-poller north Atlantic, then we lighten the

119
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:58,080
surface water and we hinder, slow down this deep water formation, the sinking of water masses.

120
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,640
Now that's in principle, that is understood, not just in principle, it is understood. The thing is

121
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:11,120
that in real life, it's not happening in the way that we have at every minute, every place in the

122
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,400
sub-poller north Atlantic deep water formation. So it's not like we sometimes call the over-turning

123
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,560
circulation a conveyor belt, and I think there you mentioned something that is continuously

124
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,800
going, flowing, but actually the deep water formation is happening from time to time,

125
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,120
mainly in the winter time, because that's when the atmosphere is specifically cold.

126
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,480
It's also then cooling the surface water the most, and then it's also happening at specific

127
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,800
locations because it's really a delicate balance of what exactly is the local surface temperature,

128
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:48,400
atmospheric temperature above that, what's the local salinity value, and that's also why it's

129
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,840
difficult for us to say when are we really stopping this process, because we do know that we're now

130
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,240
putting more fresh water in the sub-poller north Atlantic. The greenland ice sheet is melting,

131
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,800
under climate change we see increased precipitation over this region, so also more fresh water,

132
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,400
but whether or not and how much this influencing the over-turning circulation really depends on

133
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:20,400
where exactly is what happening. So which is more, has a higher forcing component of salinity or

134
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,040
temperature, like a small change in salinity or a small change in temperature, which causes the

135
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:36,640
water to not descend or to descend faster? That's a very good question, and it depends.

136
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,640
So because the relationship basically between temperature, salinity, and density is not linear,

137
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,320
so basically how much, when I change the temperature a little bit, it matters whether I change it from

138
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:57,040
20 to 21 degrees or whether I change it from 5 to 4 degrees. The differences or the effects on

139
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,560
density are different and the same is with salinity. So we can't just talk about the change, we would

140
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:08,320
have to also talk about the background state and then look at the change to say what is more important

141
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,640
and then also when we look at it right now, in terms of the more dominant driver is actually the

142
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:21,360
temperature, but in terms of what we human change and how we change it, it's actually, the system

143
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:29,040
is more sensitive to salinity changes right now. So here's a dumb question, but it's my podcast,

144
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:39,520
so I can ask some dumb questions. When water evaporates from the ocean, the ocean is a salt water,

145
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,960
but when it evaporates, the salt doesn't evaporate, the salt stays in the ocean,

146
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:53,840
so the clouds just get non-saline water droplets, and the part two of the question is,

147
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,640
as we head into a world with a higher standard deviation of precipitation, floods and droughts,

148
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:10,320
et cetera, does this changing precipitation pattern over the oceans and supposedly indirectly

149
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,880
over the land which would run off into the ocean, does that higher standard deviation

150
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,320
indirectly affect the salinity of the melt water in the oceans and change this amok?

151
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,680
So first of all, your first question, comment, I'm just going to comment that was right,

152
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:34,240
so basically rain is freshwater and the salt just stays in the ocean when it evaporates,

153
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,400
which is why when we have more precipitation over an ocean region, we are freshening the water there,

154
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:47,360
we are decreasing the salinity, and yes, I mean the thing is, unless with global warming where we

155
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,040
can basically say it might depend on the region, but in general we see global warming globally,

156
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,160
so there's warming close to everywhere, when we talk about the changes in precipitation,

157
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,880
there it's way more difficult, so we have a tendency of saying, okay, the regions that now

158
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,680
receive precipitation are likely going to receive more and the drier regions are going to be drier

159
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:15,120
in the future, but that's like more a general thing, it doesn't have to be true for every place,

160
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:21,200
but we can see in our climate simulations that yeah, there's a tendency towards more

161
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:26,400
precipitation over the regions where the deep water formation for the amok is happening,

162
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,360
and that in itself is basically bad for the amok because it can slow it down,

163
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,120
but that alone wouldn't be the problem, I think a bigger problem is actually the melting of the

164
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,400
ice sheets because due to the reason what you said, also snow basically, I mean that's frozen

165
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:48,160
precipitation, so that is also pure freshwater, and all this melting runoff coming from the

166
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,240
green and ice sheet and entering the sub-Polaroid Atlantic, that's actually potentially very harmful

167
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,200
for the amok, but there are also other effects, just basically the surface warming that we see

168
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:09,200
globally in the oceans could also hinder the or slow down the amok because it's also making

169
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,120
the surface water lighter, enhancing what we call the stratification of the ocean, really meaning

170
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,480
that there's not a lot of vertical mixing, and therefore also, yeah, tindering the deep water

171
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:28,320
formation, so there are really multiple effects overlaying this, and I could actually get on

172
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,600
and go on and on because it gets even more complicated, I listened to a few of your podcasts

173
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,720
and you also talked already about the aerosol forcing basically, and it's important for climate

174
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,480
change, and that actually also plays a role for the amok because a lot of the aerosols right now

175
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:52,480
where they are basically are located in the atmosphere, it's cooling regions that could also

176
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,400
be critical for the amok and help in that sense, kind of and basically be good for the amok in

177
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,440
terms of it's cooling the regions where the deep water formation is taking place, and that might

178
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,640
help the driver of the amok, but that also really depends on where exactly, and this is something

179
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,920
that is different from climate model to climate model, which is why it's so difficult for us to

180
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:19,520
really say what is going to happen to the amok. We're going to get into the implications of this,

181
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:28,800
which are potentially quite horrific in the coming century, but as a scientist, and I can

182
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:35,600
tell from your voice, do you ever feel a sense of wonder that teams of humans with technology and

183
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,480
computers and observations were able to figure out the things that you're describing today?

184
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:47,600
I mean, it's pretty cool, right, that we can understand the dynamics of the ocean currents

185
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:51,840
and all that. Do you ever feel like, wow, this is amazing?

186
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,240
When I take the time and take a step back, I guess from what I'm doing, because I mean, in my

187
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,720
day-to-day work, I'm more concentrated on what we do not know and what we haven't figured out yet,

188
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,680
and from that point of view, it's also a little bit frustrating because we know that the amok

189
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:16,080
is a potential tipping element in the climate system that it could shut down.

190
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:23,520
We see from paleo data evidences that it might have happened before, and we are not really

191
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,040
much closer to knowing when exactly this will happen in terms of timing, in terms of how much

192
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,760
degree of global warming would be okay before the amok could collapse than we were like 20,

193
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,280
30 years ago, even though we know much more. But basically, in discovering more, we also

194
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,000
discovered that there are more uncertainties and more things we do not understand, and that

195
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,120
all in all led to the thing that we are still pretty uncertain.

196
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:53,920
Let me give you three scenarios, and you can speculate knowing, like you just said, we don't

197
00:20:53,920 --> 00:21:00,320
know, but you're very knowledgeable on this topic. The first scenario is that the amok slows around

198
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:08,480
15% and stays there, kind of like it's doing now. The second scenario is that it continues to slow

199
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:16,320
another 50% or something like that. The third scenario is that the amok actually stops

200
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,440
in the coming 100 years or 200 years or something like that. Under those three scenarios, what would

201
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:30,640
be some of the effects that the world could experience, or Europe and the North Atlantic

202
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:38,480
coast in the USA and Canada? Can you just paint a picture of what the future might look like under

203
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:45,280
these three scenarios? Sure. Maybe just as a feedback question, what kind of climate change

204
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,880
scenario otherwise are we looking at? Basically, because that again is very important, are we

205
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,760
looking at a global warming world, or are we saying, okay, we keep this level of global warming

206
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:06,480
plus an amok slowdown collapse? Right. This podcast, we talk about neuroscience and debt

207
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,800
biodiversity and climate and economics. Every one of those is unbelievably complex, and yet,

208
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,640
and this is what we're trying to do. What you're saying is that let's keep everything

209
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,400
constant with climate the way it is right now today. If we were able to do that, which of course,

210
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,000
we're not, this is just a thought experiment, then the amok would exhibit under those three

211
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:38,480
scenarios. I said it would have certain effects, or you could look at it as what is the, at two

212
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:46,080
degrees above pre-industrial Celsius, what would do the amok? They're moving in tandem.

213
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:54,560
Let's just say that two to two and a half degrees Celsius in the three scenarios I told you.

214
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,240
Yeah, so basically, if the amok stays as it is right now, so basically, it slowed down by about

215
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:12,080
15%, then we would probably, I mean, see what we link to the amok at the moment, which is,

216
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,560
I already talked about this global warming signal. You see global warming, or the warming

217
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,880
everywhere around the globe, but actually, when you look at the long-term temperature trends,

218
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,800
you can see that the mid-center of the North Atlantic cooled over the last century.

219
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,520
Of course, this is not true for every single year. I mean, right now, we are having extreme

220
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,240
warm sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic, but the long-term trend for that region

221
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,760
actually has a slight cooling signal, which is unique seen globally. And that is something

222
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,520
that we link to the decrease in amok strength and the decrease of heat being transported.

223
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,160
So the amok normally transports heat into that region, as the amok slows down,

224
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,760
less heat is being transported into that region, which is why we can see a global cooling signal,

225
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:04,800
a local cooling signal in that region, despite global warming. This is now making it more

226
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:14,560
complicated, because when we change the local rate of warming, basically, if that is different

227
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:20,800
from one place to another, then this has an effect on the atmosphere in terms of when we look at

228
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,600
the changes in sea surface temperatures pattern. So that's what the amok is doing. It's kind of

229
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:34,080
heating some of the ocean surfaces and cooling others by transporting heat. And this then is

230
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,920
being translated to the atmosphere by either warming or cooling the air there. And this then

231
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,520
leads, for example, when we have strong amok, we have a heating, the local air above that region

232
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,680
rises, we have a low pressure system above that surface region, a higher pressure system in the

233
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:57,200
air, or up higher up in the air. And what I'm trying to say, I'm probably doing a very complicated

234
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,760
job in doing is, is that we have an effect on weather systems. And what has been shown for

235
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,200
the amok is basically that a slower amok can actually lead to heat extremes over Europe in

236
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,080
the summertime by influencing the state and location of the jet stream and the weather systems

237
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:24,240
that are moving with that. So you're saying that the ocean current dynamics of the amok would

238
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,120
create a cool blob in the North Atlantic. And because of the jet stream and the pressures

239
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,920
that that actually could cause a heat wave in continental Europe.

240
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:44,800
Yes, exactly. Because it's determining how the jet stream is located. And that then determines

241
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,920
whether the air that is coming towards Europe is either coming from polar regions or whether it's

242
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:56,320
coming from the African continent. And in that case, this would actually favor an air pressure

243
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,960
distribution where we have more air coming from the South towards Europe, so hotter air and therefore

244
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,480
can lead to heat extremes. Okay, so carry on with my speculative question. What would be

245
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,680
some of the effects if under these three scenarios, and you can tell me what climate

246
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,600
scenario you would like to choose. I just want to isolate as much as possible. Of course,

247
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,320
we're part of a complex adaptive system, so we can't just talk about the amok without the other

248
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,760
things. But I don't think many people understand the risk associated with just this one ocean issue.

249
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:44,000
So maybe you could explain under a not too bad, bad and horrible scenario what some of the impacts

250
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,160
would be. Yes, I think maybe I'm talking mainly about the impacts. And with most of them, I think

251
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,640
the risk is just going to be higher under a stronger amok slowdown scenario. Maybe it's a

252
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,600
little bit different for a complete collapse of the amok. So what we know what the amok is important

253
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,120
for, I said it's important for the heat transport. It's also important actually for getting heat from

254
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,920
the atmosphere, extracting that and getting it into the deeper ocean. So in a way, it's also

255
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:17,600
important for cooling the atmosphere. We know right now that, and I guess maybe some of you have

256
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,920
heard that, the ocean is taking up about 90% of the excess heat caused by global warming.

257
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:32,800
And how does that happen? Yeah, basically, it's kind of a simple loss of thermodynamics and physics

258
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,360
and I guess you know that. I mean, if you have two systems of different temperature,

259
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,120
then you will have a transport of heat from the hotter to the colder system. That's basically

260
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,040
why we get cold when we go outside in the winter time. And I think it might be also

261
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:55,280
then important to know that this effect is stronger with water. Maybe you know when you are

262
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:02,240
out in 25 degrees air, it's a warm summertime. If you stay in water that's 25 degrees Celsius for

263
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,920
a longer time, you will actually get chilly because the heat capacity of water is four times

264
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,680
larger than that of air. Basically, it can take up heat easier, but it's also conducting the heat

265
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:21,840
faster away from you. And what's happening really is we heat the atmosphere and the ocean below that

266
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,400
is colder. They're not in equilibrium and normally systems will always tend towards going into an

267
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,280
equilibrium. And because of that, we have a heat flux from the atmosphere to the ocean. Now the

268
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:40,960
thing is, it's really, the ocean is vast. So the mass of the ocean is, even though of course it's

269
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,520
in terms of depth, it's up to 11 kilometers. So that's not as deep as the atmosphere is going in

270
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,880
height, but because the air gets thinner as we go up into the air, the mass of the oceans actually

271
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,000
more than 100 times larger than that of the air and the atmosphere. So the ocean really has way

272
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:09,440
more capacity for taking up additional heat. So the good news is that our planet has these deep

273
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:20,320
and cold oceans that have buffered the effects of heat from our greenhouse gas trapping activities.

274
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,440
The bad news is, is they've done this largely invisibly without being recognized and we've

275
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,040
taken this buffer for granted. And what an amazing thing that these oceans are so potent,

276
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:39,520
but they've kind of blinded and caused a delay in our ecological impacts, yes?

277
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,080
Yes, that exactly. And it's basically a problem that is emerging right now, because you probably

278
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,520
know the problems that we see with coral reefs and the bleaching effect. I mean, and that is also

279
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,400
due to ocean acidification, but it's mainly due to marine heat waves. And this is something we're

280
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:04,400
seeing now more and more as we're heating up the ocean. And also, it might lead to us taking for

281
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,920
granted that the ocean can take up this much heat and, by the way, also carbon. But that is not

282
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,000
necessarily the case. I mean, as I said, systems tend to want an equilibrium. So if we put more

283
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,600
heat carbon into the atmosphere, the ocean will take up more. But the pace of how fast the ocean

284
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:26,880
can do that depends on how strong the ocean is stratified and how much deep water formation

285
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,720
also we have. So basically, the deep water formation kind of acts as a link between the upper

286
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,560
ocean and the deep ocean. And if we don't have that anymore, then the upper ocean takes up heat

287
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,200
and carbon, but it's fairly full soon, basically, because it's a thin layer. And it really only

288
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,080
triggers very slowly to the deep ocean. And therefore, there will be like a delay time

289
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,120
when we have the deep ocean connected to the upper ocean via deep water formation,

290
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:00,400
then we can take up or the ocean can take up the heat and carbon much faster. And that's important,

291
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:07,360
but that might actually be hindered in the future by the effect itself, by the increased

292
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,360
stratification because of warming the ocean. And yeah. Yeah, so many questions, Lefka.

293
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,480
We're talking about the Amock in the Atlantic Ocean. But presumably, there are currents in

294
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,160
all the other oceans as well that we're just talking about the Atlantic one, right?

295
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:35,280
Yes. Yeah. And in the past, I've had on a friend of mine, Peter Ward, who's a paleobiologist who's

296
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,440
written books, one book called Under a Green Sky, which was about a historical

297
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,600
period called a Canfield Ocean where they became stratified and produced hydrogen sulfide gas.

298
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,880
And there was no exchange between the different layers. What are the possibilities of that

299
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,040
happening? And what are your thoughts on that? Well, I mean, in principle, it's never completely

300
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,680
going to happen, right? I mean, even if you have like a very stratified ocean, if you keep warming

301
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:14,640
the atmosphere and with that the upper ocean, there will always be a little bit of mixing

302
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,160
and diffusion basically, and the heat is going to travel downwards. But normally,

303
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:25,920
and this is why the Amock is so important, as I said, that's a place where we have a lot of mixing

304
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:33,200
with from the surface ocean with a deeper ocean. And it's basically the difference in I put a drop

305
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,520
of color, let's say into a water glass or a water bottle. If I wait a very long time,

306
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,240
it's going to mix perfectly, but I would have to wait a very long time. If I take the bottle

307
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,000
and shake it, I can do it within a second. And the effect is not as big with the Amock,

308
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,400
because it is a local effect, but it's still a deep region or a large region in the North

309
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,320
Atlantic where we have a mixing between upper and lower or deeper ocean. And that's why it's so

310
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,320
important. And the same is kind of happening, as I said, with carbon. So also the carbon uptake

311
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,600
of the ocean is again, it's the same principle. We have an equilibrium between the carbon pressure

312
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,560
in the atmosphere and the one in the ocean. We put right now more in the atmosphere,

313
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,080
the ocean is taking it up. And the speed depends on the rate of mixing in the ocean.

314
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,800
Okay, so the oceans have taken up approximately 90% of the additional heat

315
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,440
in the atmosphere and approximately 50% of the carbon, something like that?

316
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,560
Yeah, I think it's a little bit more. I'm not completely sure about the number,

317
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,480
but I think it's more like two thirds of the carbon.

318
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:53,360
Okay, so can this continue indefinitely at this pace? I assume the answer is no.

319
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,040
What is the mechanism that reduces the ability of oceans to absorb heat and carbon?

320
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,880
And what happens if they can't absorb anymore? Or what happens if they can't absorb as much?

321
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:15,840
Yeah, so basically, the mechanisms are slightly different. As I said, it really is related to

322
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,840
an equilibrium between atmosphere and surface and then the mixing basically between surface

323
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:31,440
ocean and deeper ocean. With carbon, we also have the problem that it's a gas and gases are easier

324
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,440
soluble in or you can dissolve them easy on cold water. So as we are warming the ocean,

325
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,240
we are actually kind of reducing the capability of the ocean to take up carbon. I mean,

326
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,120
as long as we keep pushing more carbon into the atmosphere, the ocean is going to take up more

327
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:55,920
carbon because we increase that pressure. But if that process is slowing down, then we see, of

328
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,800
course, also a faster rise in atmospheric carbon concentration because we have to

329
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,680
make the pressure even higher from the atmosphere on the ocean for the ocean to keep taking up.

330
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,240
And then the problem is, of course, also that this equilibrium is going to change in the future.

331
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,000
Let's imagine we stop with our CO2 emissions and we actually manage to stabilize the atmospheric

332
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,480
CO2 concentrations and even reduce them. Then at some point, basically, the ocean is going to

333
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,400
outgas that additional carbon right now and giving it back to the atmosphere and the same

334
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,960
as with the heat. If we start cooling the atmosphere by going into the right direction,

335
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,080
basically, because it's what we want, then the ocean who's now acting as a buffer might give

336
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:46,720
that back on long time scale. So it's really also, yeah, has to change how we are treating

337
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,400
our solutions and our future pathways by having to consider what we are now changing in the ocean

338
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:59,760
system. So we're going to get our carbon security deposit kicked back to us at the end. So the

339
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:09,440
buffer turns into a boomerang. Once our emissions slow or stabilize, hopefully soon, maybe in 100

340
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,520
years or something like that, the oceans are going to then give some of that back at some point.

341
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,040
Yes, exactly. And we have to take that into account.

342
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,760
Are we taking that into account? That's a very good question. I think in general,

343
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,480
of course, we are aware of that. But most climate scenarios that we calculate often,

344
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,280
they stop in 2100. As if our world stops in 2100.

345
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,720
Exactly. And that's not really an oceanic time scale. Let's put it like that. So I guess often,

346
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,520
it's not taken enough into account. So in the earth system timelines,

347
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,960
this is something that's important to look at. Yes. Yeah. Okay, so getting back to the three

348
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:06,720
scenarios, just let's just say that we don't do anything to abate our emissions and economic

349
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:15,920
growth is somehow able to continue and EMA continues to slow. What are some of the impacts on

350
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:22,800
Europe and the world under those scenarios? Just as a disclaimer, basically, it's in general kind

351
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,960
of complicated to really like single out what is an EMAG effect and what is an effect, basically,

352
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:36,320
of a changing earth system when the EMAG is also changing. Let's assume that they change

353
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:45,040
at the same rate, the rate they're changing now. Yeah. So basically, this knowledge is coming

354
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,720
mainly from either paleo data or climate models. So when we basically look at the climate model,

355
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,880
then what we see is that when we slow down the AMOG, we have an increase in storm activity

356
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,640
and winter storms over Europe in the winter time, which is mainly related basically to

357
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,240
changes in the sea surface temperatures pattern in the North Atlantic, which is driving the winds,

358
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,920
and that's basically what we can see. We also expect changes in precipitation, mainly over summer,

359
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,400
and that really depends on where in Europe you look, but in general, it seems to get a little bit

360
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,320
drier with an AMOG slowdown. The explanation is fairly easy in the way that if we put less heat

361
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,240
into the North Atlantic, we have less evaporation, and due to the wind system,

362
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,160
normally this evaporation is being transported towards Europe. When we look at the US coast,

363
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,760
we actually see an increase in sea level rise, and the explanation is actually quite beautiful.

364
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,080
I mean, it's not a good thing, but the explanation is beautiful in the way,

365
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,800
because I don't know whether many people know that, but when we would look at the ocean surface,

366
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,160
it's actually not flat. So basically, when you look from space at the ocean surfaces,

367
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,280
you really have hills and bumps and so on, and that is basically because water masses are moved,

368
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,520
and we have, due to the rotation of our Earth, we have a constant force. I mean,

369
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,520
physically saying, we say Coriolis effect, not force, because it's not in a physical

370
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,440
divinitional force, but basically we have something that is moving the water masses

371
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,560
if something is moving more northward on the Northern Hemisphere, it's being deflected to the

372
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,880
right. And now when we look at the surface currents of the Amock on the Northern Hemisphere,

373
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,440
they are moving northward, so water masses are being deflected to the right towards the

374
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,560
midst of the North Atlantic, which is when you would look at the North Atlantic. You actually

375
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:53,040
have a water hill in the middle of it, and lower water levels, or basically towards the coast of

376
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,200
the US. And that is really linked to the strength of the surface current of the Amock. And if that

377
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,680
strength is slowing down, if that current is slowing down, then basically this water hill

378
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,640
in the middle of the Atlantic is getting lower, and the sea level at the US east coast is getting up.

379
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,360
And again, it's kind of really complicated to say or difficult to say how much exactly that

380
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:20,560
would be. So from climate simulation, it seems like a complete shutdown of the Amock could

381
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,400
lead to an additional approximately one meter of sea level rise at the US east coast,

382
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,640
but there it also really depends on the city because of complicated dynamics,

383
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,040
but that's a link that we know of.

384
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,760
And what about the temperatures in Europe, if there's a large slowing or shutdown?

385
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:49,920
Well, if there's a shutdown, it could be locally up to 10 degrees or more, and that depends on,

386
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,120
do I look at the annual mean temperature? Hotter or colder?

387
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:01,040
Colder. If the Amock shuts down, then because of this missing heat transport by the Amock

388
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,120
towards the northern hemisphere and Europe, it gets colder.

389
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,240
So like the movie the day after tomorrow, just not as exaggerated?

390
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,960
Not as exaggerated and not as fast, of course. I mean, in the day after tomorrow,

391
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,320
everything happens within weeks. And that's something of course, it's also important to stress.

392
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,280
We know that the Amock has a tipping point, which means that if we push it too much towards

393
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,360
slowing down, there are feedbacks within the system that basically would continue the slowdown

394
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:41,360
process and would lead to an even slower Amock. But this is not happening within days or weeks,

395
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:46,320
but decades. Could you just briefly mention one or two of those such feedbacks?

396
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,920
Yes, one is actually, and this is a nice thing, I guess, that we are talking about the same

397
00:41:51,920 --> 00:42:00,800
principles. And again, again, the Amock itself is, as I said, it's transporting warm and saline

398
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,920
water, surface waters northward. And I said, ocean density is determined by temperature and salinity.

399
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,200
So basically, the Amock by transporting salt towards the region where the deep water formation

400
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,720
of the Amock is occurring is actually kind of enforcing its own driver. It is making the water

401
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,880
denser where it needs it to be dense to keep going. But if the Amock slows down, then we have

402
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,680
less salt there. And it's, of course, it's a different effect from adding fresh water to the

403
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,800
system. But the result is the same, less salt in the subpoena north Atlantic, where the Amock

404
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,120
deep water formation occurs. You are so smart and articulate. And I have to also point out that

405
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:51,840
you were doing this not in your native language. So it's so impressive and important and interesting.

406
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,120
So thank you. Thanks for pointing that out. Sometimes I feel a little bit stupid when I say

407
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:03,120
something in English and the world's tumbled out of my mouth. I could never do a scientific climate

408
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,600
discussion in English, let alone German, the way that you're doing now. So let me ask you

409
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:18,560
another dumb question. If Amock slows or stops, it could be up to 10 degrees Celsius cooler in Europe.

410
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:27,200
But this is why while at the same time global warming is occurring. So does that mean elsewhere

411
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:33,440
in the world, there's somewhere that has a corresponding heat pump to make the whole

412
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,640
thing a little bit net hotter? Or how does that work?

413
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:45,200
Yes. So A, yes. So basically, again, Amock transporting heat from the southern to the

414
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:50,240
northern hemisphere. If the Amock stops, we have more heat access in the southern hemisphere.

415
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,360
And that is also what we see in any kind of simulation where we simulate an Amock shutdown

416
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:03,920
is more heating in the southern hemisphere. Exactly where is difficult to say. It's probably,

417
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,960
of course, in the North or in the South Atlantic, so in that region, but it kind of seems to spread

418
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:18,400
globally. So this would not be good news for Brazil and Argentina who are already experiencing

419
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,640
quite hot temperatures from climate? Exactly. And I would even go so far to say it's also not

420
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,920
good news for us, even though we might have a cooling through an Amock slowdown or shutdown.

421
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,920
And I mean, we now said, OK, it could be 10 degrees. It really depends on the simulation.

422
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,800
But then we would have to add that a shutdown is probably going to occur. Maybe it occurs under

423
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,720
five degrees of warming. So you could say, OK, great, we have five degrees of warming,

424
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,360
10 degrees of cooling, so maybe a little bit of cooling. But A, this really, it's very local

425
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,640
effect. So we don't know exactly where yet. And that is, of course, a very complicated thing,

426
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,920
because it also means on how to be prepared for our future. It would be very different under

427
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,120
an Amock shutdown than it is under a general global warming scenario with just an Amock slowdown.

428
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:19,280
There are decreasing benefits in an economy to more complexity. There are also decreasing

429
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,880
benefits to conversations with average people due to more and more complexity.

430
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,040
And this is an incredibly complex topic. But a simplistic understanding is there a risk for

431
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:42,080
trying to get people in Europe aware and engaged and voting and doing things to mitigate

432
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,160
more global warming, that if they hear that the Amock is going to slow and that Europe is going

433
00:45:50,160 --> 00:46:00,480
to be a lot colder, doesn't that emotionally kind of defer the urgency of climate change at the

434
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,800
margin to some people? Have you come across that? I haven't. And I think that's a very interesting

435
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:15,040
thing that I haven't, because I think it shows that people understand enough about the complexity

436
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:19,600
and that basically nobody could guarantee them that it's that they're better off with an Amock

437
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:24,960
collapse. It's that that we tell them it's really something also depends on where in Europe you

438
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,240
live. So it's not going to be like a cooling everywhere in Europe, but it will be really

439
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,800
centered about the North Atlantic. It's going to change precipitation patterns. And I think

440
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,440
looking basically at the last years with flooding events and draws and so on, people know that

441
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,280
all these changes in dynamics apart from a simple change in temperature can

442
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,040
give so much additional risk or bring so much additional risk that I think a lot of people

443
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,920
know no, this is not something one risk, even though there might be a very, very small percentage

444
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,080
that's actually going to benefit very few of us. So obviously, you can't distinguish

445
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:14,800
you, Levka, wearing a scientist hat or wearing I'm a human being hat. But if you could just

446
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:23,280
loosely release the scientist hat for a moment, where do you speculate in the distribution of

447
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:30,400
possible futures? What's your gut feel on where we will eventually land in terms of

448
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,480
temperature Celsius above pre industrial average? My feeling is we're going to land

449
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,200
somewhere where we do not want to be. And that's basically what scares me. I think we're going

450
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:48,400
to land somewhere where we are forced to act because the consequences are so dire and so extreme.

451
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,960
And I mean, this is the problem is, of course, I think that the regions globally that are more

452
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,160
vulnerable are not the ones where the power and the money sits. And that basically means that

453
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,400
we are probably going to see the consequences maybe more in having more refugees and having

454
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:14,320
more war zones and stuff like that. And yeah, it doesn't matter what the number is going to be.

455
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:20,400
I think the reality is not going to be nice. I was just in India in the south of India and most

456
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,040
people there don't know about climate science. They just know that it's well, it's 100 degrees

457
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:33,600
there today in the south of India. And it kind of broke my heart because up until that moment,

458
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:40,400
I cognitively knew that there's a billion 400 people in India and the Indian subcontinent is

459
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:48,720
one of those places that it's going to warm and have higher wet bulb issues. But to be there in

460
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:57,600
person and see the real warm, lovely people and culture, it kind of hit me because I visualized

461
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,280
some of this happening not centuries from now, but in the coming decades. So I hear what you're

462
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:13,840
saying. So how do you, and we'll get back to this, but I want to still ask you some questions

463
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:21,360
about AMOC. How do you and your colleagues measure AMOC? How can you even measure such a thing?

464
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:31,760
Yeah, that's very complicated actually. So even a few years or a few decades back,

465
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,160
I think the first AMOC measurement that I know of, like a real measurement basically where they

466
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:44,160
went into out onto the North Atlantic and put instruments out in the ocean is from 1959. And

467
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:48,800
back then what they had to do is basically they really had to go on a research vessel and then

468
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:53,920
drive along the whole width of the Atlantic, because you really have to go from basically

469
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:01,360
Africa to the US and Brazil basically to really cover the whole length to take into account

470
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:06,640
all of the water masses that are being moved. And that's how it was done for most of the time.

471
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,440
And from these first measurements, and that's very costly, it takes a couple of weeks to actually do

472
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:19,600
this. And yeah, just being on a research cruise every single day is, as I said, very expensive

473
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:25,760
and resource extensive. But these first measurements that they made indicated that the AMOC slowed

474
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,200
down by quite a bit between 1959 and I think the last measurement was in 2001, where they

475
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:38,640
will really assess that. And the first estimate was the slowdown of 30% over that time. And that

476
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:45,040
was of course a dire news, but it also led to a lot of scientists saying, well, can we really

477
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:52,000
say that? Because this was deduced from five measurements to five research cruises basically,

478
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,480
going out there over a course of 40 years. They were done during different times of the years,

479
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,680
some were in spring, some were in autumn. And basically what they always gave us was one

480
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:10,880
snapshot of AMOC strength in time. And I mean, basically, if I would try to understand how

481
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,480
temperatures are changing, and basically I'm measuring the temperature right now today,

482
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,600
and then tomorrow I'm going to measure the one in the morning and then the next time at night,

483
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:26,560
then I know even though I have measurements from three consecutive days, I can't really

484
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,920
deduce any trend from them because they're measured in different times of the day. And we

485
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:35,200
know that there's internal variability with a day cycle. And the same is true for the AMOC,

486
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:40,560
but on time scales so that we are not completely aware of yet. So there's not just an annual cycle,

487
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:46,720
but there's an inter-annual cycle. And long story short, that's why they started in 2004

488
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:52,640
to put instruments out into the Atlantic full-time to really have a continuous measurement.

489
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,320
It's still very costly, it's a lot of work. So you have to have like researchers getting out there,

490
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:02,720
putting the instrument in, they have to be exchanged every one or two years, they have

491
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:10,720
to be calibrated. But from now, from 2004 on we have AMOC continuous data. The only thing is

492
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:18,000
basically that 2004 until now that's 20 years. When we are looking at climate change, we don't

493
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,360
talk just about 20 years. We talk about at least 30 years or longer because we know that there are

494
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:28,640
internal variabilities at place and things can basically happen or you can have a trend over

495
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,760
two to three years. That's not a long-term trend, but that's just really related. For example,

496
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:39,120
I guess most people know the El Nino phenomena. All these things have effects on the earth system.

497
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:48,960
So how does the AMOC relate to or does it relate to the Gulf Stream? And is there a risk of the

498
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:58,080
Gulf Stream slowing down? So the AMOC and the Gulf Stream are two interesting partners, brothers,

499
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:03,840
I would say, in the sense of sometimes we even talk or call the AMOC the Gulf Stream system

500
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,520
because they are closely linked but they are different. And the important difference is

501
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,480
the Gulf Stream is in surface current. It's a wind-driven surface current. Basically, we have

502
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:21,120
wind systems over the North Atlantic. They pushed the water masses due to the Coriolis

503
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,920
effects. The water masses are deflected to the right and this basically leads to the Gulf Stream

504
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,200
flowing as it does. The Gulf Stream is when we look at the size of the Gulf Stream, it's way

505
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,160
bigger than the AMOC. So depending on where you measure, whether it's close to Florida or more

506
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:43,840
towards the inner, outer North Atlantic, the Gulf Stream has a volume transport between 30 to

507
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:51,760
150 swerdrop. And swerdrop is this unit used by physical oceanographers. One swerdrop is a

508
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,680
million cubic meters of water that are being transported per second. So Gulf Stream between

509
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:03,360
30 and 150, maybe just as a comparison, the Amazon River, the largest river on earth,

510
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:10,240
has a transport of 0.2 swerdrop. So what's being transported in the Atlantic is huge.

511
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:17,520
But most of the Gulf Stream waters are then basically also end up on the return way as

512
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:22,320
a surface current. And with return way, I mean basically the Gulf Stream is flowing northward

513
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:27,440
and it's then being deflected to the right and to the right due also to the wind system. And we

514
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,440
have a southward surface current along the European and African coast basically.

515
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:38,320
We still have a little bit of a heat transport because we have the warm water masses going

516
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:43,600
towards the North Atlantic. They're being cooled and a little bit colder water masses going back.

517
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:49,440
But when we talk about the AMOC, we have an exchange of surface flow going towards the

518
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:56,320
North Atlantic and deep water, really cold flows going southward. So in terms of driveout,

519
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:01,440
for example, you could say the Gulf Stream is driven by the winds. The AMOC is mainly

520
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,440
driven by density differences. Mainly I'm saying mainly because when we go out there and measure

521
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,640
the AMOC, we can't ask the water masses, hey, what's your driver? Are you moving because of

522
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:18,560
the winds or because of density differences? We just see moving water masses. And yeah,

523
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,120
because of that, we would say probably that a small percentage of the Gulf Stream is basically

524
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:28,240
ending up into the deep water formation region and is then becoming part of the AMOC.

525
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:34,800
But the majority of the Gulf Stream is just being also traveling back southward as a surface current.

526
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:40,160
And that part is not slowing down as long as we have the winds. When the AMOC will collapse,

527
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,000
then the Gulf Stream would slow down a little bit that AMOC part of the Gulf Stream.

528
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:49,440
And warmer temperatures affect both the Gulf Stream and the AMOC though,

529
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:55,040
because the winds, to my knowledge, are created by the temperature differential

530
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:01,760
between the equator and the poles. And if the poles warm a lot, then that temperature differential

531
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:10,560
declines and that would reduce some of these winds, yes? Yes, that is true. I think although

532
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:15,840
when we measure it right now, the wind effect is really not that large right now. But in principle,

533
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:21,600
you are right that that's happening. This polar amplification is decreasing the temperature,

534
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,720
gradient, and with that, the wind strength overall.

535
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:30,320
So in one of the presentations that you have on your website and that you shared with me,

536
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:36,320
you have a slide which we'll put on screen where you highlight that the AMOC effect has

537
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:45,200
potentially just part of a domino effect in some of the other issues dealing with the Amazon and

538
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:51,520
the West Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet. Could you talk about the the feedbacks

539
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:57,360
and the domino effect that relate to not only AMOC but the climate system?

540
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:02,800
So the AMOC, I think, is special in the climate system as it's the one major connector between

541
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:07,600
Tselvarn and Northern Hemisphere between the Antarctic ice sheet and the Greenland ice sheet.

542
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:13,280
And when the AMOC, let's assume the AMOC would slow down by a lot, we kind of said, okay, that

543
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,240
means more excess heat in the Southern Hemisphere, less in the Northern Hemisphere, that could, on the

544
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,280
one hand side, stabilize the Greenland ice sheet because it's cooling down the sub-Polynorth Atlantic

545
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:29,040
around Greenland and could therefore stabilize that ice sheet. But it would lead to more heat

546
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:35,760
around Antarctica and could therefore, yeah, lead to more melting there and destabilize.

547
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,000
When we look at Antarctica, mainly the western part is the one that we are worried about the

548
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,560
most right now because it seems to be the most destable one already. And with that, of course,

549
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,120
then enhance sea level rise. But, and this is really important, it kind of shows that the order

550
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,560
of things happening has an effect. Because if the Greenland, I said a slowdown of the AMOC could

551
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,760
stabilize the Greenland ice sheet, if the Greenland ice sheet is tipping, then this would actually

552
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:09,680
lead also to a destabilization of the AMOC. Because if that basically is the order, because

553
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:14,560
we have a lot of freshwater then melted on Greenland and flowing into the sub-Polynorth Atlantic,

554
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:20,240
and I explained already how this can slow down the AMOC. So, yeah, but it shows that the whole

555
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,560
Earth system is linked. And when we have those major effects happening, more can follow.

556
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:32,400
You may be too young, and I don't know what TV shows there were in Germany when you were growing

557
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,760
up. But do you ever get the feeling that this is all part of some Twilight Zone episode that

558
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:45,280
we're describing this, the biogeochemical cycles of the planet that you and I are alive on.

559
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:53,600
And we're talking about like major Earth system changes happening on our watch. Doesn't that just

560
00:58:53,600 --> 00:59:02,480
blow you away at times and not in a good way? Yes, actually, yes. And I think it feels so strange

561
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:09,440
that as humans, I mean, an individual human is very small and in a way, I don't want to insult

562
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,200
anybody but insignificant. And for example, when I go out on the North Atlantic on a research

563
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:22,400
vessel and you are out on the ocean, then there's huge water masses, so much power around you,

564
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:28,320
so much energy. And also when we look, I mean, I talked about the volume transport by the AMOC,

565
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:33,360
that's huge, that's nothing we can do basically in terms of engineering. So I had actually people

566
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,320
contacted me saying, can't we put some kind of robots into the water and move the AMOC

567
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:45,360
ourselves? No, we can't because that's way too much. That is so huge the system that we can't do

568
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:52,400
that physically. And yet we are actually messing with the system by something as burning coal,

569
00:59:52,400 --> 01:00:00,480
by putting CO2 into the atmosphere, so by actually doing, affecting even tinier particles. And it

570
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:08,880
feels very wrong, very scary, I guess, trying to be optimistic. Okay, it shows that we can

571
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:17,520
actually affect the system a lot. But yeah, it feels like we are playing with something and we

572
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:25,840
don't know the rules. And we can talk about this. I'm a science communicator and I know that people

573
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:32,320
that follow this channel are very fluent in these issues, but relative to the general public,

574
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:41,360
the AMOC and ocean risks are relatively unknown, especially in my country. What about in the

575
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:48,400
scientific community? Is there increasing consensus among your colleagues on the AMOC and

576
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,840
climate and scenarios going forward? Or is there still quite a bit of disagreement on the broader

577
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:04,000
trends? There's certainly an increased amount of consensus. So when I basically did my PhD and

578
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,920
I published my first paper on an AMOC slowdown, there were quite a few scientists who made the

579
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:17,120
point to me that there are other explanations for the signals that we are seeing. And I mean,

580
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:24,000
the difficulty here is, I mentioned the real like direct ABIC measurements continue started in 2004.

581
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:29,520
So to know what happened over the last century, we have to look at what we call proxy data.

582
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:36,320
So other climate variables that we can measure that we know are related to the AMOC and then kind

583
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:42,000
of deduce the AMOC evolution from them. And I worked with my PhD supervisor Stefan Ramstof on

584
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,440
looking at the sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. And there are a lot of reasons

585
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:52,080
why we know that they're linked to the AMOC. But of course, they are also influenced by other

586
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:55,680
things. For example, an increase in wind strength could cool the North Atlantic

587
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:02,480
as would an AMOC slowdown. And while there was no one in the scientific community who said,

588
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:08,800
you must be wrong because of that, there were a lot of people saying, well, but it could also be

589
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:13,200
a change in the wind system. We don't know that yet. We don't have the data to support that.

590
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:19,120
But you can't be 100% sure. And I mean, that's true. I would say in all of climate scientists,

591
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:24,640
we basically are never 100% sure because that's not how science works. We basically,

592
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,920
we make an assumption, we look at the data and we try to explain all the data that we have,

593
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,520
according to that assumptions. And if we find something that is basically disproving what

594
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:41,360
we thought first, then we have to find a new assumption. This has changed because there

595
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:46,080
have been more and more publications that indicated an AMOC slowdown and none that showed

596
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:51,120
the opposite. There's still some data where we are, okay, this is interesting. We can't completely

597
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:59,120
complain that yet. But with that, the consensus is definitely increasing. I think one problem

598
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:05,920
is also just the way the science community works as a whole. So it's not that there's one publication

599
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:10,320
about something and everybody's, oh yeah, now we're going to believe that. It's more like, oh,

600
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:16,400
interesting. Now let's wait a little bit, see what other research groups are publishing on that,

601
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:22,000
test that. I mean, that's good. That's how we can make sure that we are not basically following

602
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,360
some random group, but that we're really getting to enhance our knowledge. But it also makes a little

603
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:34,400
bit slow and maybe with regards to climate change too slow. It's so complex. And I'm sure you deal

604
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:45,280
with ocean AMOC experts in your paper writing and your job. But then there's Arctic climate

605
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:54,320
specialists and cloud physicists. And there's all sorts of different disciplines within the

606
01:03:54,320 --> 01:04:00,000
climate discipline itself. And how do you all meet at conferences and compare notes on things

607
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:05,760
that you're not experts in that someone else is? What's your experience there?

608
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:14,720
My experience is that the different disciplines are too siloed, basically, so then don't talk

609
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:21,120
enough to each other. And I think it's not just a problem with within the disciplines, but also

610
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:27,360
with the way science is being done at the moment, that it's really pressed towards publications.

611
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:32,080
As a young researcher, I know basically I'm being measured by the amount of first author and second

612
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:37,120
author publications that they have. Because of that, too many papers are being published and no

613
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:42,480
one can read all of that. But to publish a paper, you have to find something new. And I think what

614
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:48,400
we really have to do more is actually synthesizing the data that is out there, the publications

615
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:58,480
that are out there. Yeah. So tell me about your work. Where do you work? What do you do? And if

616
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:05,600
you and your team are successful, what do you hope to accomplish? Yeah, here I have to admit that

617
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:13,360
basically, I kind of left the AMO community, the very small AMO, not small, but the focused AMO

618
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:17,920
community. Because of the experience I made in the last years, that basically,

619
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:25,040
the AMO is a topic that is able to raise attention, maybe also because of this movie,

620
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,360
The Day After Tomorrow, and at least in Europe, a lot of people know about the Go stream and the

621
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:36,480
importance. But there are so many things happening when we look at the increase in extreme weather

622
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:45,280
events, when we look at flooding. And I feel that the increase in fires, so many things related

623
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,600
to climate change that happen on a way faster time scales than the AMO and that have a big

624
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:58,160
effect right now, that I basically went to my former institute, the Potsam Institute for Climate

625
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:02,960
Impact Research, and now work with Johann Rockström on the planetary boundary framework,

626
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:08,000
which is highlighting actually this global approach and the synthesizing approach, saying

627
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,160
it's not enough to just look at one special corner or area. And I mean, this is actually going

628
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,760
further, saying, okay, not just AMO is enough, not even just climate change is enough to really

629
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:25,760
have to look at the earth system, and looking at all its components, looking at the biosphere

630
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:30,560
integrity and basically how the biosphere is right now functioning in our favor, because that is

631
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:36,720
also taking up a lot of carbon, how it's basically working in terms of the radiation budget. And I

632
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:44,480
just feel that we know so much that we can do that would improve the lives of so many people on earth

633
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:50,800
in terms of, of course, reducing CO2, but also living more sustainable, changing our diets

634
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:57,760
towards more plant based, that I just wanted to work on that. And I think the problem is in getting

635
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,400
people to act that most want numbers and certainty, and we can't give 100% certainty yet, and we can't

636
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:11,680
give like the exact numbers, but we can give with 99% 0.9 certainty the direction that we have to go.

637
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,200
And I just want to press that and work on the science there.

638
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:24,800
This is an interesting thing, because if we stop this conversation now, you have outlined

639
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:33,200
scientifically, credibly, in some detail how the AMOC works, and my viewers will have learned about

640
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:38,560
that. There's a wide variety of viewers that follow this channel, because we cover all the

641
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:45,440
aspects of the human predicament. But once we go into what should we do about it, I'm sure you have

642
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:54,320
some suggestions, then once we talk about prescriptions, then some people no longer believe

643
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:00,160
the scientific description. And I'm not talking about you, I'm just talking about generally in

644
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:06,160
the world, there is the explanation of the issue, and there's the what to do about it,

645
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:09,440
and they confound each other. Have you experienced that?

646
01:08:10,080 --> 01:08:18,080
Yes. And I mean, I'm not 100% surprised by it, because it often seems to be human nature,

647
01:08:18,080 --> 01:08:25,680
right, that we find it really difficult to change. And I mean, when I look, we look at our everyday

648
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,160
lives, I guess most people know basically what would be best for their own health in terms of

649
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:36,400
exercise, diet, and so on. But they seem to be not to be able to do what's best for them in the

650
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:41,600
long term. I guess short term, I can basically say, okay, I want to eat this right now. So I do

651
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:47,520
it because it makes me happy. And so it's not surprising that when it comes to this even bigger

652
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:53,440
and more longer term issue, that of course, we are not able to choose what's best for us in the

653
01:08:53,440 --> 01:09:01,920
long term. But it's also really, really frustrating. I think if 10 or 20 or 30% of people chose the

654
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:09,120
better path for climate, there would be a social primate pressure to do that. But since it's

655
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,760
someone else's problem, and in the future so far, we have not, we've not done that. Plus, we are

656
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:23,040
individual humans as part of this globally connected emergent energy, hungry,

657
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:34,000
pseudo organism that has a life of its own. So climate is a real problem for this situation. And

658
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:42,080
the only antidote that I can think of is more conversations like this that act as a facilitator

659
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:46,960
between our current behaviors and our mental understanding of the future.

660
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:54,400
I agree. I think that the best way still to basically facility or induce change is to explain

661
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:00,080
things, to understand things. Because if it's difficult to change, then we will only change

662
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:05,520
if we really get the reason. So earlier you said, and I happen to agree with you,

663
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:14,720
that we're going to do business as usual, make a few little benign tweaks on the margins,

664
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:26,320
but not do anything major until we see the temperature, precipitation, ecological impacts

665
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,320
are horrifying. And then we're going to try to do something radical

666
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:37,520
at the last minute. Do you have any speculation on what some of those radical interventions might be?

667
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:46,080
Oh, I don't know yet, because I guess it's kind of like a path I don't really want to go down in

668
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:51,280
my mind. I mean, the thing is, of course, that there are, as far as I know, they're not like real

669
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:56,640
international laws on what kind of climate or geoengineering is allowed or not. So I'm afraid

670
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:00,560
that some people might be thinking, oh, cool, now we put a lot of air results into the atmosphere

671
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:07,680
because that at least has a cooling effect for a few years. I know that I think, I mean,

672
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:14,560
those ideas have been tested in climate models and basically run through and none of them

673
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:21,200
seems to be promising for the moment. So I would say that anything radical that we do is probably

674
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:29,840
not going to be wise. So could you offer any non radical suggestions to our viewers,

675
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:38,320
either as individuals or as parts of institutions that create policies? And, you know, my view is

676
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:48,480
Germany or the United States can't just be climate friendly policies and go to the Paris Accord

677
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:54,640
agreements. It's a global, you know, the CO2 is not recognized national borders. I mean,

678
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:03,760
it's a global thing. So what sort of recommendations do you have to avert some of the

679
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:09,520
default paths that we're currently on with the AMOC and with the global climate system?

680
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:14,800
I mean, in principle, it is very simple. First of all, we really have to get our CO2 emissions

681
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:20,640
down. And I think personally, that means on the one hand side, I would really encourage people to

682
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:28,000
basically look at the political party that they support. And this topic should be in there. And

683
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,280
I mean, I'm not basically, for me, it's not really important whether otherwise what kind of

684
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:39,200
faction you support and whether you like our fan of capitalism or free markets or whatever,

685
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:44,560
the climate topic should be in there no matter what the party is, because that's non-negotiable.

686
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,240
And that's nothing we can basically, we can't talk to the climate system or to the earth system and

687
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:54,800
say, Hey, now we're going to pay you this amount of money and you're not going to change. So that's

688
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:59,920
important. And please stress that no matter what you otherwise basically stand for believe in.

689
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:07,520
And then the other thing is also be skeptical, I think, because we like easy solutions. But

690
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:12,560
normally the easy solutions is not the best solution. And I think that's just something

691
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:17,280
most of us know, right? If we work hard for something, normally it stays longer,

692
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:22,400
basically what I gain in a minute, I can often lose very soon also, what I gain with hard work

693
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:28,880
over years, that stays. And I think so with that, be okay with that, it's going to be hard, but it's

694
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:34,080
not going to be negative. A lot of the decisions or changes that we have to make, as I already mentioned,

695
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:39,760
would also be good for ourselves. I mean, we do know that a plant based diet is better for most

696
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:45,760
of our health. And that basically cycling a lot. I mean, who wants to sit in a car all day and drive

697
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:51,200
around? Maybe a few people do, but and that's okay too. I think kind of try to find the changes

698
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:58,560
that are okay with you. Nobody has to change their life completely. But we can all make changes that

699
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:05,040
basically make our lives more sustainable. And I think that's also important to like really

700
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,800
take care of that and do the effort and don't do it for somebody else, but basically do it

701
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:17,280
because it's the right thing to do. That makes sense. It does make sense. But as I said, climate

702
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:25,040
is a global issue and we've got India planning to double coal production in their country by the

703
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,760
year 2030. And you can understand why they want to do that because they're going to have higher

704
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:36,240
temperatures and they need more air conditioning and cooling for their population. So there is

705
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:41,360
individual recommendations and I agree with the ones that you laid out, but there's got to be some

706
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:50,720
sort of global plan and there isn't and I know why there isn't. So is there any hope in the

707
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:57,120
international scope of things that you and your colleagues have? I think these COP meetings so

708
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:05,600
far have been a real disappointment. They have no teeth. And I think the difficult questions are not

709
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:11,680
askable with all these high status men and women from around the world because they don't like

710
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:19,440
truth to power sort of questions. Yeah, that's a very good question. And I have to say basically

711
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:27,840
there's a reason why I'm not in policy because I like honesty and I like being direct and I can't

712
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:34,320
deal with people who try to tell me something by I don't know going around the issue and telling me

713
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:40,720
something else. And with that I'm also very frustrated and I think honestly that this

714
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:47,040
lying on a like lying on that level on an international level and with lying I'm also

715
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:53,280
meaning that if you like draw attention away from the truth or you hide some fact that should be

716
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:59,280
really punishable I think because it is misleading and it's hurting so many people. I'm also hopeful

717
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:06,240
because I've actually met a few people that are active in policy and that have great ideas and that

718
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:12,880
are really really enthusiastic and engaged in trying to protect others those who can't protect

719
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:18,640
themselves. But of course I do see that we are not really getting closer to a solution right now

720
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,960
and I honestly don't know how to change that how to help that. I think we if there are people out

721
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,000
there who know that their strength is to influence other people basically and to get them to basically

722
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,200
do what you want them to do then please use it for good that's what I'm asking you. I can only

723
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:40,000
give you the facts but we see that delivering the facts is not enough right that's what we've seen

724
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:46,720
that that's not enough we kind of need some kind of climate lobby where we really say hey people

725
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:53,840
this is what you have to do. Maybe we need effectivists instead of activists. So let me let me ask

726
01:16:53,840 --> 01:17:01,200
you a personal question. You're obviously very knowledgeable and passionate about this topic

727
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,720
as you should be because this is the topic of our times well one of the the core ones anyways.

728
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:16,480
How do you manage being all in as you clearly are on ocean issues planetary boundaries where

729
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:23,920
we're headed and then have a normal life and have a cheeseburger or strudel or whatever whatever

730
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:29,680
you eat there with your high school friends and and your family how do you live in both worlds

731
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:39,040
because I struggle to be honest in in in my life with with that. Yeah I do too and I guess I mean

732
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:43,840
I'm not completely sure what I'm leading a normal life compared to everyone else. I would say that

733
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:50,240
when I look among my amongst my friends most of them basically support the same things I support

734
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:55,040
so I'm really living in a little bit of a bubble and most of them really try to be as sustainable

735
01:17:55,040 --> 01:17:59,520
as possible. I think it would be difficult otherwise it's something that I do see with

736
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:04,880
family with I mean you don't choose your family right you are born into it and there I'm having

737
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:11,360
sometimes complicated or complicated discussions and sometimes I just yeah decide not to discuss

738
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:18,320
certain things and in other terms I mean I have to admit say that this kind of is also affecting

739
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:24,560
basically how I plan my life and I do see that basically I would say the goals and dreams that

740
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:30,640
my parents have given me and kind of saying hey when you are I'm 34 right now so I should probably

741
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:38,000
have two kids a husband and a house and basically I have a partner fiance I'm very happy with but

742
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:45,760
we never plan on getting a house because that's not really I think realistic achievable for most

743
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,400
people so I guess that of course but some people can have their own house in their own place but

744
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:55,840
when we look at the number of people we have on the planet our limited resources then not everyone

745
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:01,360
can have a house actually most people can't have their own house and it's also really when we think

746
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:06,640
about okay do we want or not have children do I want to put my children into this kind of world

747
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:12,320
will I be able to adequately protect them with what's coming in the future these are things

748
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,840
I'm discussing with my my partner and with my friends because it's yeah it's not just about

749
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:23,440
what is my own happiness basically and do I give on my genes to the next generation

750
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:31,200
we certainly know that in terms of population we don't need every one of us to get a child

751
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:38,640
so we are enough people on the planet and of course in terms of resources not having a child

752
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:43,280
is way smarter than having one which is not saying that nobody should have children of

753
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:50,160
course if you but it's something that I think is in there I know of those things I know of

754
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:55,680
the limited resources and I can't forget it when I basically enter my private life what I

755
01:19:55,680 --> 01:20:03,680
learn or do during my work time so I struggle as you long ago I chose not to have children

756
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:11,120
genetic children you and I both have cultural children in a way with the young people that we

757
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,520
influence with these ideas and I have ducks and and dogs which also eat resources but

758
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:23,840
that's the path I chose so let me ask you one more scientific question and then I'll get to the

759
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:29,840
closing questions that I ask all my guests would it be fair for me to say that this year

760
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:38,800
will be the coolest year of the rest of my life on average of course there could be El Nino and

761
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,840
La Nina and other things but is that a fair assessment to make given what we know about

762
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:50,640
the inertia of the climate system? Sort of I mean you just chose basically an El Nino year which

763
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:57,040
of course we know is a global average a higher temperature so I very much hope that the next

764
01:20:57,040 --> 01:21:02,640
two, three, four years will be on average a little bit cooler again but in terms of course

765
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:10,080
of the long-term trends yes so basically I wouldn't see like a large scale cooling signal

766
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,120
is not going to happen within the next decades even if we would stop all emissions right now so

767
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:24,400
yeah but yeah thank you that's my understanding as well but I wanted to back it up with a

768
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:30,640
climate scientist and I will have Johan your colleague on in the near future he was supposed

769
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:40,480
to be on tomorrow but we had to we had to reschedule it so Lev K I really I really like you and I

770
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:48,160
respect what you're doing and I feel the the passion and frustration bubbling just under

771
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:55,280
the surface because this isn't our fault what's happening but you and I were born on this planet

772
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:03,680
as humans during this time of the carbon pulse and looking around us and figuring it out is

773
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:09,920
someone's job and I'm glad that you're doing it so do you have any personal advice you just

774
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:17,680
mentioned about houses and children but do you have any personal advice for the listeners of this

775
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:24,080
show that are hearing what you're saying and concerned about the future what what sort of advice

776
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:30,480
do you have for the listeners I would say on the one hand side kind of be creative in your dream

777
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:37,120
I kind of mentioned that we don't have to have the same goals in terms of having or becoming rich

778
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:44,320
having our own house or having to basically fly have a vacation somewhere fancy tropical every year

779
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,320
because that's what doesn't tell you what makes you happy so really like listen

780
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:54,320
in your inner self basically what really does make you happy because I think most of the stuff

781
01:22:54,320 --> 01:23:00,720
that makes you happy can be very sustainable and totally fine and be done within the earth resources

782
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:09,680
but then the other thing is I still believe and try to act under the assumption that humans are

783
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:15,840
good and that nobody really wants to be a bad person or tries to harm others I mean there might

784
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:22,560
be a few exceptions but I think most people even if they actually do something right now that is

785
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:28,240
causing a lot of emissions and harm to the environment they have a reason that can probably

786
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:34,080
be understood by us because there is a reason in their reasoning why they're doing this and why

787
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,360
it's a good thing to do and so it would be good of course we have to educate those people and we

788
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:46,960
have to try to change them but we shouldn't like make them to monsters and we should act in the way

789
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:54,400
saying hey okay I see what you're doing this is how it's like this how why I don't like what you're

790
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:59,280
doing because it's hurting this and this person can you explain to me why we're doing it and maybe

791
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:05,600
we can find a solution together so I think that's important to also just stay optimistic and to like

792
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:11,920
life and also because I really believe it's true so most people I talk to when they do something

793
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:17,200
like how can you do that then they explain it to me I'm like oh okay and now it makes sense but hey

794
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:21,360
there's actually a different way of how you can do this which is way better for the environment

795
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:26,720
and for everyone and how would you change that advice for the young people watching the show

796
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:32,160
and their teens or 20s who are becoming aware of all this and they have a whole lifetime ahead of them

797
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:42,000
that's a very good question and I would say I'm not completely sure what I would say I would

798
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:49,600
probably apologize for not for not having taken better care of their world so far I mean and I'm

799
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:57,120
still fairly young I would try to I would say be bold basically just because you're young and it

800
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,480
feels like you might know less and that's something I experience as actually as a scientist so I mean

801
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:08,720
I'm talking to colleagues who have 20 or more years experience than I have in the topic and sometimes

802
01:25:08,720 --> 01:25:14,080
still they I see that they make mistakes and it just takes me more longer to be brave about that

803
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:20,640
and say hey no I'm studying this too and you might have more experience but I put a lot of time in

804
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:25,760
this and I know I'm right and I think that's also what the young people is when you feel something

805
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:35,440
is not right be brave about it be bold about it and change and otherwise probably also be hopeful

806
01:25:35,440 --> 01:25:41,920
find your own future but in general I have to say it does it's hard for me it's hard for me to be

807
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:47,600
like completely optimistic towards a person who has I don't know 70 80 year ahead of them because

808
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:52,640
I know that life is going to change quite a bit during that time so this is a question I ask all

809
01:25:52,640 --> 01:26:00,880
my guests and I think you may have subliminally through your things that you've left unsaid have

810
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:07,280
given the answer but what do you care most about in the world Lefke it's probably a fair and honest

811
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:16,800
world so I think that this is what bugs me most about I guess this topic is that the main people

812
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:24,320
who are causing the problems are not the ones that are suffering the most and that's just not

813
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:32,640
what I like so it's really the fairness and the main non-humans are going to suffer as well

814
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:40,640
that's a very good point yes yeah so if you could wave a magic wand what is one thing you might do

815
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:45,280
to change human and planetary futures if there was no personal risk to yourself

816
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:52,720
kind of depends on on the limit I mean if I could basically change the climate system the earth system

817
01:26:52,720 --> 01:26:59,120
back to a pre-industrial state and fix it in that way that no matter what we do we we couldn't

818
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:05,360
change it as humans that would of course be a safe way although maybe we wouldn't then learn

819
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,960
I think if it comes to the human mind as I said I would really like us to be able to make the

820
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:17,120
advice's decision to be objective look at the facts and then decide what we do based on them

821
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:25,680
and what we want to happen and not based on this weird mix of emotion fear maybe favors

822
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:33,520
yeah so that I think would already bring us a very big step further towards a sustainable future

823
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:42,640
thank you if I were to have you back on the show which I would love to what is one topic

824
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:50,480
in your broader work that isn't a broad overview but is a very specific topic that you think is

825
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:55,200
relevant to our future that you would be willing to talk about in depth

826
01:27:56,720 --> 01:28:04,000
the next time well given my my location better my job right now it would really be about the link

827
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:11,040
of the climate system towards the rest of the earth system towards with the land system with

828
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:18,480
species diversity and how all of this is basically connected but from a scientific point of view so

829
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:24,320
not from a like spherical point of view mother earth but really we see so much scientific evidence

830
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:30,480
for that and I would love to talk about that excellent any closing words for our viewers

831
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:35,920
and listeners lefka I guess honestly if they listened until this point then I would thank them

832
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:43,600
for being so interested in the science because yeah I know it's a complicated topic and I

833
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:49,200
know that it's hard to understand and I mean I've been doing this for 10 years nearly and

834
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:54,160
I'm still learning new stuff so yeah thank you for your openness to learn about these things for

835
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:59,040
your willingness hopefully to change that means a lot and that's I think what the world needs

836
01:28:59,040 --> 01:29:04,800
thank you so much for your time today lefka and for your important work on this issue to be continued
