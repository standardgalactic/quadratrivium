1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
At the end of the day we're all in this situation together and it's no individual's fault that

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,440
we got here but it's everyone's responsibility regardless of what decades you were born in

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,800
to contribute towards responding so I would love to see older generations firstly stop

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,320
saying that it's down to our generation. Secondly stops having conversations about these topics

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,040
in closed rooms amongst academic elite and instead actively engaging in the intergenerational

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,160
transfer of knowledge and expertise and skills so that our generation and younger generations

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,120
can be equipped as best as possible to face the challenges ahead.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,120
Today I am joined by three humans in their early 20s who have found themselves immersed in the work

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,760
and scholarship surrounding the great simplification. As you might be aware the viewers of this

10
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,400
channel and this content in the world tend to skew older but it's my belief that bringing

11
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:08,960
young voices to the table getting their perspectives on the future, platforming their ideas is

12
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,640
essential for us to navigate the coming decades especially those young humans who have a systems

13
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,520
understanding of the complexity and the risk that we face. As such this reality round table is

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,560
focused on the perspectives of youth today how they feel about the current state of the world,

15
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,880
what their hopes are for the future, what their ideas are for the future of society. Joining me

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,880
today are Priscilla Trinh who currently serves as the director of communications at the Post

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,120
Growth Institute and co-coordinator of the Minnesota Youth Institute. She's the creator of

18
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,640
the Post Growth Jobs Board editor at the Blue Marble Review and contributor to the Minnesota

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,240
Women's Press. Also joining me are is James Branigan a writer, philosopher and content creator

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,800
with a YouTube channel of his own. James is committed to the task of addressing some of the

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,000
many facets of the human predicament with education and food production systems being

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,240
two of the more appealing ones for him. He is Irish and currently lives in Spain.

23
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,840
Last but not least is Natasha Lindhart who is a recent graduate of the University of Amsterdam

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,440
with degrees in economics and business and electives in degrowth and critical theory.

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,840
Natasha has been a volunteer for our organization for the past year and she will be starting full

26
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,800
time as a research associate this summer. I hope this is the first of many round table

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:47,600
discussions with young humans. I hope you enjoy it. Welcome young humans to reality round table

28
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:56,000
number nine, Priscilla and Natasha James. Great for you to be here. Nice to be here too. Thanks for

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,680
having us. Thanks for having us. You're welcome. You're very welcome. I would like to have more

30
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:12,000
young humans on the show because you are going to be living a long lives during the great

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,600
simplification and what's ahead. So let me set the stage for this. I know all three of you.

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,280
Priscilla was one of my students. Priscilla I've known you since you were 17 or such and you were

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,520
my teaching assistant for my class reality 101. James and Natasha I've met online through the

34
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:42,880
podcast. So I have various hats especially for Priscilla. I was a professor and a mentor and a

35
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:51,760
coach and a friend. For the next hour plus though I am just a podcast host. I want you each to speak

36
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,200
your authentic selves about what you believe and feel and think about our world and our future.

37
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,080
And before we get to that if you could maybe each of you give a brief introduction of who you are

38
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,800
and what you're doing right now, you know, brief bio. Natasha we'll start with you.

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,760
Yeah so hi I'm Natasha. I'm 23 years old and I usually live in France but I'm currently in the

40
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:26,000
British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean because I'm doing a few months of backpacking and traveling

41
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,560
before starting work full-time with Nate and his organization. And yeah it feels very surreal to

42
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,240
be here because I've learned so much from this podcast. So thanks for having us. Priscilla.

43
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,160
Hey everyone Priscilla Trin here. She heard pronouns. I am also 23 and calling in from

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,400
Oceti Shacoenlands also known as Minnesota United States and I do communications work in the realm

45
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,360
of alternative economics and food systems and that's my job and energy right now. James.

46
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:07,040
Hey I'm James. I'm 25. I'm Irish but currently in Granada. I just love biology and environmental

47
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,200
science and as with Natasha I came across the great simplification and it's pretty surreal to be here.

48
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,800
But right now I'm studying regenerative agriculture and how to work the land that way.

49
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,320
Excellent. Well thank you all for being here. As is usually the format I'm going to have a framing

50
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:33,760
question and you'll each have five plus or minus minutes and then we'll we'll carry on and have a

51
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:42,560
conversation after that. So I would love each of you to respond and describe your your own personal

52
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,720
journey learning about the various economic and environmental risks and crises in the world around

53
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,040
us and and how has that shaped the way you see the future and your own place in it.

54
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,720
Yes in my journey understanding about the meta crisis specifically and how the different

55
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,800
environmental and economic risks and crises are related and interconnected. That journey was

56
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,120
life changing. It was definitely a roller coaster and I'd say it was made up of a few

57
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,680
different phases. The first being a sort of awareness phase which started about two years ago

58
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,880
and that was triggered by a few different events and circumstances that maybe we can dive into later.

59
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,560
But it was basically a six month period in which I exposed myself to a lot of information

60
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,080
about the various crises we face at the moment both environmentally and socially

61
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,080
and economically and I came to realize that they were all just symptoms of something more

62
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,760
complex going on beneath the surface and that was the time period where it came across your

63
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:51,040
work name and across this podcast and that awareness phase really taught me firstly that we have

64
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,120
this socioeconomic reality or this economic superorganism as you call it that's the outcome

65
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,240
of institutions and behavior being oriented around profit maximization and the expectation of

66
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,440
continued growth and the dynamics embedded in that socioeconomic system are driving the crisis

67
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,000
that we face and the fundamentally incompatible with the long-term well-being of the planet and

68
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,760
of people and that realization for me was really hard to take because I'm a part of that system

69
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,960
right um we all are to lesser and greater extents so I had to come to terms with the fact that I

70
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,360
was part of something that was driving the crises that I cared about and I cared about addressing

71
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,440
and then it didn't get much better because during the awareness phase I also learned about energy

72
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:46,160
and about ecology and I learned that this economic superorganism and this version of humanity was

73
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,280
coming to an end and was self-terminating because it could only function by continually

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,840
destroying the things which its survival depends upon so that meant I had to throw all the expectations

75
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:04,720
I had about my future out the window and at that stage I entered a phase of grief I suppose I was

76
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,880
grieving for the death of an illusion that I'd had about reality but also about my future

77
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:18,240
and that period really sucked I don't want to sugarcoat it I would cry a lot whenever I was by

78
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,440
myself I felt really really lonely and at that stage I felt very powerless it wasn't very fun

79
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,040
but I will say there was 100% necessary because only by going through that and feeling those

80
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:37,360
things could I then get to a phase of acceptance and that phase of acceptance really meant for me

81
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,600
internalizing and really fundamentally accepting inside myself that the future was going to look

82
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,760
very different from the present that the future was going to look different to what I'd been taught

83
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:56,000
to expect it to look like and that this version of humanity that I'd come to consider the norm

84
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,880
and which had characterized my life up until that point was what had passed its sell-by date

85
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,040
and was going to have to come to an end if we didn't want the biosphere to come to an end first

86
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,520
and for me realizing those things and internalizing them meant that now there was no way that I could

87
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,280
have a career or a role in the world which actively contributed towards maintaining and

88
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,440
perpetuating the status quo so I had to totally redefine the role I saw for myself in the future

89
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:34,960
and moving forward and now I very much see that role as twofold firstly we need to be

90
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,480
putting in place safety nets we need as many people as possible going into the future with our eyes

91
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,200
wide open and planning and putting in place structures so that the transition to a lower

92
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,280
energy throughput future can be accompanied by the least suffering possible because I think there

93
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,560
will be a lot of suffering especially in terms of material wealth and I really really really fear

94
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,480
that if we carry on going blindly into the future then when shit hits the fan we will turn to the

95
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,920
worst versions of what humanity is capable of and we know that humanity is capable of some really

96
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:16,800
horrific stuff but we're also capable of some great things so I think the second task is to

97
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,960
actively sow the seeds and create an alternative an alternative socioeconomic reality and I think

98
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,040
that's quite an exciting task that everyone can play a role in because we need as many ideas and

99
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,840
skills as possible to create a version of humanity that can not only outlive this one

100
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,360
but also which gives the biosphere and society the best possible chance of thriving

101
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,560
long into the future so I see those as the roles I can contribute to moving forward

102
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,480
in the short term I think we need to be raising awareness and bringing this stuff into the

103
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,280
mainstream so there's many people as possible can be contributing to those tasks so that's

104
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:58,800
why I want to be focusing on energy on in the near future but yeah that's sort of where I'm at now

105
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,400
and to be honest since reaching the acceptance phase I'm very very content and very happy

106
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,120
and the lifestyle changes I've implemented as a result of becoming aware of all this depressing

107
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,840
content have actually had a hugely positive impact on my well-being and happiness so yes the grief

108
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,720
sucks but it's necessary and it's worth it and yeah at the end of the day we still have life

109
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,000
and that's amazing so I try to enjoy it as much as possible I resonate with Natasha's grief period

110
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,200
but I would say the metaphor I would use to describe my journey is a happy tumble down a hill

111
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:42,720
I was rolling down into these rabbit holes picking up flowers and rocks along the way this clarity

112
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,520
that's exhilarating like when you're rolling down a hill right but you're also as you are tumbling along

113
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,960
gaining all this knowledge there's also this back of the mind fear like what if I bump into

114
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,800
something that I don't like and I don't want to hear and it's scary to really internalize that

115
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:04,160
information and then finally get to the bottom of the hill and I have to look up and I'm breathless

116
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,840
by all that clarity but also exhilarated because now I'm looking up at an amazing valley and knowing

117
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,880
that even though the road ahead is very long and uphill it's beautiful because I'm not doing it alone

118
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,640
I think when people have asked this question in the past how did you get to where you are it's always

119
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,440
been explaining it as oh you know we did the canon event of going to college and becoming radicalized

120
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:33,120
but it's a lot longer than that having reflected on my positionality how I've come here growing up

121
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,600
in an immigrant family but I'll get back to that later I really think your classmate was kind of

122
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,440
catalyst for connecting all the dots right you realize that it's not money that makes the world

123
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,480
go around its energy and then when you combine that with an understanding of evolutionary psychology

124
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,240
it really undoes the whole monolith of human nature and it really made me appreciate the

125
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,240
plasticity of culture and that gives me a lot of hope as I learned about the biophysical limits of

126
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:10,720
our world I was also moving more in the direction of activism intersectional feminism was a huge

127
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,080
part of the lens in which I view the world and it was a mixture of what I learned in class but

128
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:22,720
also the communities and spaces I entered during my organizing years understanding that energy

129
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,640
privilege is tied to class race gender sexuality all struggles are connected and moving into how I

130
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:37,040
understand about the existential risk and crises really from a place of collective liberation

131
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,920
we're all in this together it's liberation for all and that includes interspecies liberation as well

132
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,360
and again undoing the whole binary and notion of tree huggers versus realists because everyone is

133
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:56,720
affected albeit differently and everyone is subject to being oppressed or becoming the oppressor right

134
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,040
it's not just an identity politics thing it is decolonization for everyone and it looks very

135
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,160
different for the individual and as I got more into food sovereignty spaces I have a background in

136
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,400
food systems specifically organic agriculture horticulture did hydroponics research for two years

137
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:25,040
and through direct action through organizing I came to really day by day I'm more convinced

138
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,080
that local community power building is where I want to be it's about channeling the big picture

139
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:37,440
understanding into my corner of the world right we think about how it's not effective to be perfect

140
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,080
it's not about being the perfect activist the perfect vegetarian the perfect you know

141
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:49,200
bike your way to work type of person in the US I feel like given where I'm at and along in addition

142
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:56,240
to my full-time job it's also a job to be embodied and authentic and slow and intentional like Natasha

143
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,000
said to really cultivate yourself so that you can be self-sufficient but also community sufficient

144
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:08,240
whatever you learn can be re-gifted to everyone around you and I always come back to this quote

145
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,840
by Audre Lorde about how caring for myself is not self-indulgence it is self-preservation

146
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:19,200
and that is an act of political warfare and I think now that we see everyone converging on this

147
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:26,160
narrative of connecting these levels and systems at play on a planetary level on a political level

148
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:33,040
it's really cool to be here and alive during this time and I know the word unprecedented was

149
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,760
really ruined for me during the peak pandemic era but I think it's really cool that we're alive in

150
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,640
this really unique time in history and knowing that every generation before us has had to do with

151
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:52,080
their own risk for me I'm gonna die before you know probably peak climate crises hits but

152
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,880
knowing that I can do something about it is fine the allure of being the charismatic

153
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,200
speaker with a huge megaphone convincing people does not hold the same weight anymore

154
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,960
for me it's really about seeing how I fit into community and learning how to then cultivate

155
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,080
myself to be a part of that community that's how I see it. Thank you Priscilla and it feels odd for

156
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,240
me to call you Priscilla because for the last four or five years I've called you Trintab

157
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,360
which I will share publicly Jeff Bridges movie living in the future's past he

158
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,920
talked about TrimTabs which is the little thing behind the rudder of a ship that influences the

159
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:42,880
direction and your senior project was so colorful that I sent it to Jeff and he loved it and since

160
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,560
then I've been calling you Trintab so we'll put we'll put that I think there's a hyperlink to it

161
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:56,480
we'll put it in the show notes of this episode thank you James Branigan. Yeah so just a touch on

162
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,160
Priscilla's point that she made just there about the reduction of these complex issues into just

163
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:09,680
what I consider to be nonsensical binaries I think to overcome the allure of that because so many

164
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:17,760
people fall prey to that accepting one of the two ends of the extreme and to overcome that I think

165
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,280
you have to be fairly critical in your thinking and so one thing for me that I think about when I

166
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:33,120
think about this uh metacrisis or ecological issue that we're facing is that it is calling

167
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,520
forth the best of us as individuals because it has to we can't continue doing what we've been

168
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,400
doing for the past however many years you could say since the agricultural revolution to your point

169
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,720
about surplus accumulation and how that self-organizing around profits is one of the key

170
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,320
generator functions driving the problems that we face this has to change somehow not to say I know

171
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,840
how but somehow that has to change and just to be aware of that at first is of course the first step

172
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,560
but to your question about becoming aware of the ecological and economic issues I suppose

173
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:15,680
it's just a combination of like intellectual honesty and curiosity about the world because

174
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,680
when I was younger obviously I loved nature well that's not not so obvious but I really

175
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:25,200
loved nature I loved playing out in the fields in Ireland I loved being among the trees I love

176
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,400
being by the river I love making fires I loved making slingshots I loved these sort of outdoorsy

177
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,440
activities as a kid and so I sort of continued to follow that thread I was interested in biology

178
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,640
in school so then I followed that on and I wanted to remain as broad as possible in my study of the

179
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,920
world because this is so complex and I suppose as a young kid I was thinking all right how do I

180
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,480
learn as much about this as possible and not like specialize down into something too narrow

181
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:03,520
so then I went on to study general science in college or university and then environmental

182
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,680
science just because they're so broad but yeah so I suppose it was just a combination of that

183
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,920
intellectual honesty and curiosity and then also the internet the internet is a huge thing here and

184
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,960
the proper or appropriate use of the internet instead of falling into the trap of just being

185
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,400
caught by the algorithm with the short term stuff and losing your attention or losing time

186
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,440
by having your attention grabbed by that algorithm we can I think figure out a way to wield the internet

187
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,160
to our own advantage as individuals and then hopefully collectively and I think that that's

188
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,920
going to be one of the key tricks to figure out and I suppose I heard that actually that

189
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:54,640
sentiment echoed in an episode you did Nate with Thomas Bjorkman and he said about the Scandinavian

190
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:03,120
secret one of the keys there to modernize the Scandinavian countries rapidly was the implementation

191
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,480
of these schools where people could go and learn not only about the external world and what's

192
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,120
going on technologies so on so forth but also inner sort of spiritual or emotional development

193
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:23,680
and how the two relate to one another so yeah I guess that's it it's the internet curiosity

194
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:32,720
and just not falling prey to many of the pitfalls and traps that people who think about

195
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,360
the ecological crisis tend to fall prey to thank you thank you I have a bunch of questions for the

196
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:45,360
three of you are there any thoughts that bubbled up after the those the three of you spoke that

197
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,640
anyone would like to follow with yeah I just want to echo what James said about curiosity

198
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,720
because I think that's what's so special about this field is that there are so many different

199
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,440
ways of getting into it but for me yes I always cared about nature growing up and especially about

200
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,920
social issues but no more so than any other sort of environmentally and socially aware

201
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:15,440
average human so for me the reason that I'm here is purely driven by this curiosity and this

202
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:22,480
craving to understand reality and the world around me as much as possible and to get as

203
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,560
close as possible to the truth rather than holding to any set of beliefs and I think that's

204
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,880
yeah also what really motivates me in this field is that it is it's based on science and it's

205
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,520
based on fact and if you're curious enough to go there yeah this is where we get

206
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:47,760
in addition to that curiosity has also helped me navigate triggers you have to protect your

207
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,360
energy and pick your battles online especially when you're trying to be a communicator like myself

208
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,680
it's not about being this missionary convincing people they should care about ecological collapse

209
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,480
it's really leading with questions if someone disagrees with you and I try to remind myself

210
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,880
why do they think this way and then lead with questions rather than falling into

211
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,600
arguments or that divide that we see so present across geographies and cultures right now so I

212
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:22,080
love that curiosity framing. Talking about binaries let's go to the one about intergenerational

213
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:32,880
relationships with the climate and energy and economic situation I'm about 30 years older than

214
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,440
the three of you and so you know I've I've got 30 years of living in a world that was

215
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:47,200
largely functional and amazing under my belt now educating younger people on these things

216
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:53,520
how do the three of you and I'll let each of you speak feel about the seemingly perpetual

217
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:01,760
intergenerational conflict and blaming in our current culture and from your perspective is

218
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:10,480
it possible that we could move past such a phenomenon and and how. In one word heal everyone

219
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:17,440
needs to heal intergenerational trauma has been a big topic on my mind a good chunk of my life

220
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:24,240
and I think it's really important to unpack when talking about conflict and blaming I come from a

221
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,600
family of immigrants who fled the Vietnam war I'm Vietnamese my parents are immigrants and refugees

222
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,880
and outside of their story universally there's conflict militarism war PTSD everyone experiences

223
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,680
trauma to some different degree and that really affects parenting that manifests in money trauma

224
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,440
how we relate to the economy and that affects how we relate to each other as people and so

225
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,400
to address intergenerational conflict and blaming I think we have to then recognize

226
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,760
intergenerational value for those of us who are lucky to have elders in our lives you know I had

227
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:08,560
my grandma my maternal grandma and I think about how in the US there's such a sad attitude about

228
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,360
older folks there's ageism in the workplace there's ageism when it comes to political

229
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,280
social values but we have to know that all these movements that we're a part of now the environmental

230
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:24,720
movement the economic movement they were all founded by people who came before us right so

231
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,400
elders have wisdom and value and Nate I don't think you're an elder quite yet but in some ways

232
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,600
you are like our community elder right you have lots of ideas and experiences share right and

233
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,840
it comes back to the whole constraint of our economy because capitalism in the US means that

234
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,360
we're bound to our day jobs we have time constraints and then we don't have the time privilege then

235
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:55,200
invest in relationships and I think investing in relationships healing recognizing when our emotions

236
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,360
get the best of us is really key to then unlocking very generative conversations

237
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:07,280
and having intergenerational movements because it's not young people versus old people at all

238
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:14,560
you need all of us involved and one book I read recently there's an author a local author here

239
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:19,280
in the state she wrote a book called can we please give the police department to the grandmothers and

240
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,680
I think it was a beautiful exercise of imagination and how we can then rethink the way we relate to

241
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,640
one another rethink what it means to be safe because at the end of the day we're very emotional

242
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:38,080
beings and everyone is really just seeking to be heard seen understood and that affirmation is

243
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,000
important if we're really trying to build safety nets safety nets for whom who who is benefiting

244
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,760
from these safety nets we think it's good for us but maybe someone else doesn't feel safe

245
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,520
from that safety net so when we begin to heal and talk about mental health and really holistic

246
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,800
health I think it's I think it's going to be a big part in moving forward to to bridge these gaps

247
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,680
yeah I couldn't agree more healing is important and I remember in my mind I thought of it this

248
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:09,280
way I considered there are sort of four key elements in like the individual human's life

249
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,080
and I call them the most basic basics it's like food make sure you get your food right make sure

250
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,520
you get your exercise right make sure you get your sleep right but also make sure you get your

251
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,800
social relationships right so that speaks to Nate I think you formulated it by saying something

252
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,480
like become a fully stacked behaviorally stacked human being and you yeah you pointed the same

253
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,200
thing sleep food um exercise because how can we expect to face these issues and overcome them

254
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,520
if we're in any way ill in terms of our health that's not to say it's impossible but why not

255
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:49,840
optimize for these elements of human life because we can but to this point about blaming to be

256
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,920
honest I don't really I don't really see it I don't see my generation blaming the older generation

257
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,800
one thing that annoys me is this the fact that it's the older generations who have all the

258
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:09,120
resources and money but it's the younger generation who has all the energy but missing the resources

259
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,320
the money so there's a clear sort of niche there for collaboration and why it's not happening

260
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:20,880
I'm not sure so I wouldn't really blame I actually I don't even think blaming is productive what's

261
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:28,960
the use that it gets us nowhere so why not instead of blaming seek to collaborate and seek to

262
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,920
somehow create the mechanisms that can funnel resources from the older generations to the

263
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,840
younger generations in a collaborative sort of agreement between all of us

264
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,960
yeah I couldn't agree more with that I think it's about collaboration rather than blaming

265
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,880
I really see intergenerational blaming as a huge waste of time and waste of energy

266
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,440
because at the end of the day we're all in this situation together and it's no individual's fault

267
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,200
that we got here but it's everyone's responsibility regardless of what decades you were born in

268
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:11,280
to contribute towards responding and yeah as James said maybe we have our generation has

269
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:17,760
more energy or time hopefully over which to enact those responses but there is no way

270
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,600
that we can do it without the experience and also importantly the leverage of older generations

271
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,760
so I would love to see older generations firstly stop saying that it's down to our generation

272
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,640
secondly stops having conversations about these topics in closed rooms amongst academic elite

273
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,440
and instead actively engaging in the intergenerational transfer of knowledge and expertise and skills

274
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,760
so that our generation and younger generations can be equipped as best as possible to face the

275
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,400
challenges ahead and also I'd like to see the older generation engaging themselves in facing

276
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,280
those challenges and many are already but we need more people in all generations doing that

277
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:06,960
in terms of moving past the intergenerational blaming what I would love to see is if somehow

278
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:16,080
we could adopt a collective mentality which saw this current version of humanity not as a final

279
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,000
product that either has to be defended by older generations or destroyed by younger generations

280
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:29,200
but rather as a work in progress and within that having the collective maturity

281
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,560
to acknowledge and accept human fallibility like we're not perfect we're very very far from being

282
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:42,320
perfect we make mistakes and we get things wrong and that's okay but it means that we have to be

283
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,880
learning from those mistakes we have to constantly be trying to improve and I think if somehow we

284
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,680
could get to that collective mentality it would go a long way to moving past these cycles of

285
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:58,800
blame because it would mean that we could on the one hand be grateful for what older generations

286
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,120
and prior generations have given us and the experiences they've given us access to while

287
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,360
simultaneously acknowledging that mistakes were made and there was incomplete understanding of

288
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,640
reality which mean that from today we can't make those same mistakes and all of us in all generations

289
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:20,400
have to do things differently and do things better and we still won't be perfect but at least we can

290
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,680
work towards creating something that we can be proud to pass on to future generations.

291
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,760
I'm with Natasha that there needs to be shared values and I think it comes down to a rebranding

292
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,840
issue right I think many of us are disillusioned with ESGs and the global north framework of

293
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:44,880
environmentalism activism and systems change it's a very global north eurocentric approach and

294
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:51,200
recognizing there's a plurality of work that's been done over the years is important

295
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,520
in bridging the narrative right caring about our crisis is not a trend it's not something new

296
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:01,840
solidarity is not you know something that you do now because everyone else is doing it

297
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:08,400
and I think it's really flipping the narrative of how these conversations are not just happening

298
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,960
on podcasts for people who have time to listen to them they're happening on the ground and

299
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:17,600
it really does come back to what James was saying it's about this lack of resources

300
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:25,360
how many of us do not have time especially in the global north where we have day jobs that keep us

301
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,920
from advocating for things we want to do and then you got to wait until retirement when you have

302
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:36,000
time to advocate and lobby so it's this mismatch between what we're bound to financially in our

303
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,200
well-being because everyone needs a paycheck to survive in parts of the world now and then how

304
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:47,840
can we then cultivate time and space do that and that's going to take a bit of help outside of the

305
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,360
typical at least in the u.s. nuclear family or young adult living by themselves in an apartment

306
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,120
yeah so that is such a great point the fact that most of us don't even have the time to

307
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,920
engage these topics most of us are too concerned with yeah how to put food on the table

308
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,960
or pay the rent to have time to consider these topics and so this is actually one of the main

309
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,040
reasons why i'm doing what i'm doing trying to figure out i hesitate to call it like an

310
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:18,240
alternative lifestyle because it sort of has hippie connotations but i'm trying to figure out how

311
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,440
to live a life where i can fully study these topics and also pay the rent so i don't know

312
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,880
how to do that but also then attach it to your point about um like looking to the older generation

313
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,320
to try and teach us better about the world is i wonder of course the older generation

314
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,440
there's value in what they have to say but i wonder if that impulse to you know find an

315
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:51,200
authority an authoritative figure from which we can be confident um about their teachings and

316
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:57,680
how we learn about the world is itself sort of preventing us from understanding these problems

317
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,960
more deeply because i'm not sure the older generation even knows about how to deal with these

318
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,880
problems because they're so novel again it's not to say there's no use in deriving knowledge from

319
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,000
the older generations like nate for example the the great simplification thesis is hugely

320
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,200
explanatory and it helped me put the right words to the thoughts i had sort of intuited about the

321
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:29,760
world but then again i can't just rely on nate to do the work that we need to do we need to sort of

322
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,560
relocate the locus of authority in each of ourselves as individuals and then work in

323
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:43,680
collaboration with each other every everybody having done that towards solutions or long-term

324
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:49,840
management plans that can actually address the novelty of the problems we face is that

325
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,640
changing like persilla um from five or six years ago when i met you these things climate change was

326
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:05,280
known then but energy depletion and polarization and addiction and ai and some of the other biodiversity

327
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:12,640
ecological crises like PFAS and plastics and ocean issues and all these things they weren't really on

328
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:20,800
a lot of people's radar are these things commonly discussed uh with age in age groups of 23 to 27

329
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:28,480
like like you all are or is it is it um somewhat rare and in a second part of that question is

330
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,400
is it because of ignorance and in um energy blindness or systems uh lack of systems knowledge

331
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,600
or is it because i don't want to talk about this stuff i just want to enjoy my weekend and and the

332
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,360
beautiful day and and not have to think about these things do you have any thoughts on that

333
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,960
i think it really depends where you're coming from where you are located geographically and

334
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,400
culturally i feel like when you're talking to us it's a bit skewed right we already give a damn

335
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,920
but i think in the palestinian lands um that that would be a dumb question for me to ask but i think

336
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,680
it's becoming a bit more apparent i am very much sensing in the us and in the left bubbles

337
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,600
that there's this convergence on connecting the dots between economies environments and social

338
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:22,400
issues and while there is still a huge spectrum of nihilism to paralyzing fear most people

339
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,960
probably fall somewhere within the middle right some people are like i'm just here to make bank

340
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:33,760
do my job retire and die some people are it's out of my control it's too big i don't know what to do

341
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,760
let's retreat into the woods which is also just another form of dissociation and i think the

342
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,040
narrative happening elsewhere global south and other parts of the world maybe they don't use

343
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,040
the same words that we do but they are thinking about it because they have no choice but to think

344
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,920
about it in the us they're still quite a bit of a buffer for some folks and most folks in the us

345
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,960
still live paycheck to paycheck so we're very much closer to being houseless than billionaires

346
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,120
and i think that squeeze economically is really forcing people to think about more than just what's

347
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,600
hurting their wallet what's hurting their relationships and the future so i think it's

348
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:16,560
becoming more and more people's radars but they might be doing different things to address it or

349
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,480
using different words they might be advocating on parts of the system which i think is important

350
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,080
it's hard to tackle big picture always i think it's okay if it's a little fragmented and then

351
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:34,320
politically that the vocabulary is catching on but it's being so quickly co-opted that's why it's

352
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,120
so difficult to have these conversations because you don't know who you're in the room with anymore

353
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:43,440
someone could say the word sustainable or regenerative and you don't know if they if they mean

354
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,960
green growth are they a techno optimist or are they an anarchist like it doesn't it's not clear

355
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,720
anymore so that's kind of the the nice thing about it that with this digital amplification

356
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,040
you don't feel as alone sometimes because people are using a shared language but it's also very

357
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,440
quickly co-opted and misinterpreted so it's it's a mix of both i would say thank you james

358
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,320
you wanted to say something and then natasha yeah sure but uh just to the point about the shared

359
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:18,320
language thing it's just so important to understand each other and use the same language not yeah the

360
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,560
same language and understand that here's actually what i mean by this but that's so difficult to

361
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,920
flesh all of that out it takes a lot of time like the perfect example for me is the idea of

362
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,880
organic farming to the naive layperson he or she thinks that yeah this is like no chemical this is

363
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,040
pretty natural and all but it turns out that in the industry it just means something like less

364
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,360
chemicals than the industrial agricultural model but so yeah to the question i think for me anyway

365
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:49,200
i'd be a miss my friend group would be a misrepresentative sample because obviously i gravitate

366
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:56,080
towards these topics and so i tend to talk about them too and so i'm surrounded by people who also

367
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:03,040
tend to talk about them but not very many does that make it easier though i mean i would imagine you

368
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,840
you strongly value such a group oh my god i can't tell you how much i love the people the two people

369
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:15,360
i talk about this stuff with i love them so much two two of my best friends sean and my brother

370
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:20,560
patrick but uh doesn't make it easier what you mean doesn't make it easier having less people to

371
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:28,480
talk about it with or how do you mean easier well if it was just you in granada reading this stuff

372
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:36,000
online and thinking about it is not the healthiest trajectory so if you have other people to share

373
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,040
even if you don't come up with answers just a community i think is really important which

374
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:48,080
is why my class worked because we had 23 people in a circle talking about these things and sharing

375
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:55,440
because this is heavy stuff to take on just as an individual person yeah no doubt it makes it easier

376
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,640
and that's why i love that we can have this conversation now because i wonder if it will

377
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,960
work like an attractor and attract other people through the interwebs cyberspace to be able

378
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,160
to have these conversations by the time this episode airs our great simplification discord

379
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,720
channel will be live and people can find out where people are in the world and and have conversations

380
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:27,200
either online or in person because i think that i think that's important um natasha what what do you

381
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,240
think yeah i mean like james and priscilla i do also gravitate towards people who do care about

382
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,400
these issues and i have an amazing group of friends and we have really interesting discussions about

383
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:45,520
these things i would say that generally there is you know people in our generation do care i mean

384
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:54,800
it's our future um and there is general awareness about all these crises but there are so many barriers

385
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:01,360
to diving deeper into the sort of root causes and the why of these crises and looking sort of

386
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:07,920
beneath the surface i think those conversations aren't happening as much as they as i'd like to

387
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,520
see them happening and you know a big part of it is time as we've talked about people have jobs and

388
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:18,800
you've got to feed yourself and your family and and it takes a lot of time i mean for me to be honest

389
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:25,040
i spent more time educating myself about this stuff than i did focused on my university degree in

390
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:33,840
the last year of study like it's a lot of content to get through um and also there's one thing having

391
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,200
access to the content and the other thing is being in the mental space to be willing to take

392
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:47,120
on this content and to really engage with it um and i spent a long time in my youth being aware

393
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:52,560
of these crises but not really caring about going any deeper than that and it wasn't until i was in

394
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,160
a mental space where i'd removed loads of distractions from my life got off social media was creating a

395
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,640
lot of time and space for silence and reflection that then when the content hit me i was willing

396
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:09,040
to engage with it and get really deep into it so i think there are a lot of barriers that

397
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:18,320
we can work on removing thank you um excellent so uh i will remind you all that i am not a teacher

398
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:26,000
here i'm just a podcast host um but i just having this conversation this is like the

399
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,280
first conversation i've had with more than one young person at a time since i taught last in

400
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:43,440
2019 and and i do miss the the life and vitality and um curiosity and emergence uh that that comes

401
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,520
from from speaking with young people um let me let me ask you uh put you on the spot each of you

402
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,160
out of all the things that you're learning about some people call it the meta crisis i usually

403
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,800
call it the human predicament um you're you're well familiar with uh the different buckets of

404
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:08,480
risks and crises we face like what is one thing um in coming decades that that you're most concerned

405
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,000
about out of out of the whole universe uh if each of you could just speak to that for a minute or two

406
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:22,320
yeah so for me i just love my food and one of the main things that i'm concerned about is

407
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,200
no longer being able to produce food at the scale that we do currently because the fertilizer

408
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,280
pesticides and whatnot won't be available anymore or if not that the fuel for the tractors that we

409
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,280
rely on now to produce this food will just will be reallocated to other places or just

410
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,000
it just won't be there for certain local areas and that's one of the reasons why i'm doing what

411
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,640
i'm doing now is to relearn the old ways of agriculture not to return to an old way but

412
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,640
to understand how do we do this in the absence of oil and machinery i think that's a

413
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,440
i just find that intrinsically motivating to uh do that because for the you might call it selfish

414
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,400
reason that i love food not that i think the food is going to disappear in my lifetime but

415
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,480
just as a silly example that's why one of those with that is one of my main concerns

416
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,120
it's not silly and i don't consider it a selfish uh interest and i love food as much or more than

417
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:29,840
you do uh priscilla similar to james that's why i entered the field i am in right now i remember

418
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,560
when i told my parents hey i want to go to the college of food agricultural natural resource

419
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,520
sciences at the university of minnesota and they looked at me and they were like we crossed the

420
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,560
pacific to escape rice patties and now you want to go back into food what are we going to tell

421
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,080
your grandmother and i told them you tell her that as long as people eat i will have a job

422
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,920
and it's really the basic currency of our societies because yes we need energy to produce food but

423
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:01,040
without food there's no peace you can't change the world on an empty stomach and so i really

424
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,360
am concerned about our food and water quality and the the resource wars that are going to break out

425
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:13,680
um militarism is on my mind a lot everyone jokes about world war three we are living in the apocalypse

426
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,560
already and that's one thing that gives me hope when you understand the planetary boundaries

427
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,400
and the social boundaries of human patterns right all empires collapse eventually and so

428
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,000
thinking about it that way means that it really singles down a few of the things you should be

429
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,160
actually caring about and i think food and water is one of them and how are we going to set up

430
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,560
governance models and frameworks at different levels neighborhoods towns cities municipalities

431
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,960
what governance structures are in place so we can navigate these hard conversations about

432
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,120
how to allocate resources because we do have enough food in the world to feed everyone it's

433
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,800
a resource allocation problem and you know a corporate monopolization problem with big food

434
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:02,880
big ag controlling our food supply chains right now and i feel like it's doable and i don't think

435
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,000
the answer is a million organic farms that's not sustainable or viable it's not about everyone

436
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,480
becoming a farmer that's not how a society functions we need all roles all skills all

437
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:18,240
types of passions but yeah food and water is something i'm taking on myself to cultivate

438
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:23,840
skills related to that because i think it's fun like you all have said i love food and so that's

439
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,360
something i'm focused on both in my personal and professional life that's a difficult question

440
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:36,160
because there's so many uh risks and crises that we're facing to be honest i think i'm more

441
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,240
concerned with the way that we respond to those rather than the risks and crises happening because

442
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,720
i think they will happen and i would love to be proven wrong on that um i think that we will have

443
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:56,080
food shortages and there will be problems with water and there will be civil unrest um what i am

444
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:03,280
what scares me more is the way that we respond because if we look through history the times when

445
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:10,880
the economy's gone bad uh and we've had shortages in terms of resources that has had really really

446
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,480
bad knock-on effects in terms of the version of humanity that we become i mean we've become really

447
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:28,880
really awful people um so yeah what i really fear is that that this these conversations don't translate

448
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,800
to the things that Priscilla's talking about us actually thinking about different governance

449
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:40,960
structures and thinking about how we're going to distribute those scarce resources and how we

450
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:49,200
educate people so they have the skills to manage when we have to relocalize and can't depend on

451
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,280
these long supply chains um rather than just waiting for it to happen and then it turning really really

452
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:03,280
bad so i guess that's what what scares me yeah if i might just add also that that's also a motivation

453
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,480
for me it's not just my own love of food it's an understanding that when human populations feel the

454
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,000
squeeze and they see another human population over there who's doing well they this human population

455
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,600
who's doing poorly understands also that they can just steal what they have and that gets nasty and

456
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:25,920
that is sort of a a pattern that you can read from history that tends to happen

457
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:33,840
so following up on that each of you how do you maintain hope and cultivate resilience in the

458
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:40,720
face of what you know about the world and and i i would be so bold as to say you know more than

459
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:51,120
the average 23 and 27 year olds about all these risks and systems especially given reading the

460
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:58,800
news every day of what's going on in israel and palestine and ukraine and it's 45 degrees celsius

461
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:08,560
today in india which is like 110 or something like that you get daily reminders of this stuff so

462
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:17,600
how do you maintain hope and practice resilience and healthy habits knowing all this stuff

463
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:23,680
yeah i don't think we can just magically have hope from some external source i think we have to

464
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:32,960
actively create hope and yeah i see so much beauty in the world in nature and in people

465
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:39,920
and in relationships and communities but also in art and knowledge and culture and when i started

466
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:47,440
realizing the extent to which we're destroying that beauty in its various forms i would shift

467
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,640
between two mindsets on the one's hands i think well it's all fucked anyway so there's nothing

468
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,040
i can do excuse my french and on the other extreme i think that i have to personally save the world

469
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:06,880
and neither of those are helpful because neither of them lead to action so the mindset i've

470
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,680
currently developed instead through which i find a lot of resilience is firstly to feel

471
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:19,760
those things so you know i do get really really sad when i hear the news and when i see

472
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,920
nature suffering and people suffering i'm really feeling that but then also feeling

473
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:33,360
the joy but at the beauty that's still there so and the sort of mantra i use to motivate myself

474
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:41,360
is how can i use what i have to do what i can to protect some of the beauty and bring it forward

475
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:46,560
with me into the future and i think that if everyone does that even if it's in a really small way like

476
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:53,040
taking better care of your back garden or helping out an elderly neighbor if we all use what we have

477
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:59,680
to do what we can then we're creating hope i would say deep time deep time gives me a lot of hope

478
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:04,240
because when you zoom out and understand how we got here you realize how recent the current

479
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,120
order of things are dominant global north white capitalist whatever you want to call it society

480
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:15,200
is so new and back to what others have said before when you understand that it recalibrates your

481
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,720
expectations and that ironically gives me more positivity in the face of the poly crisis because

482
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:25,840
when you've understood that there are material financial and social limitations it recalibrates

483
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,720
expectations and yes that comes to the period of grief like was mentioned before it also alleviates a

484
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,840
lot of pressure yeah we might have some sort of mad max guns defending farm period but it's not

485
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,200
going to last forever right nothing lasts forever in nature and so nothing bad will last forever in

486
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,800
human human systems yes there will be ecological system impacts that will probably last forever

487
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:52,480
in the Anthropocene but i i think going back to that social governance like all the dire things

488
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,480
we're seeing in the news those will stretch out for a relatively long period of times compared

489
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,400
to our lifetimes but i know that the earth will rebound we will find a place in the future to

490
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:10,800
govern ourselves in a way that's equitable and sustainable and just understanding that no revolution

491
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,880
has been peaceful and i don't mean just like the revolution on the streets i mean the revolution

492
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:21,200
inside doing that healing work that shadow work that unlearning the breaking and creating cycles

493
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:27,280
and friend circles and families and communities it's not just about your neighborhood it's about

494
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:36,160
the regional impacts and what gives me hope is cultivating myself it's about gardening cooking

495
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,600
at home foraging being a better biker because right now we're living in an information economy

496
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,960
data knowledge cells in the future that knowledge and data has to be uploaded into our brains

497
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,840
it's a very fair and high 451 situation but knowing skills and having less dependency on

498
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,400
scary supply chains that are fragile gives me a lot of hope and empowerment make friends

499
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,720
with people who know skills that's how you build community it's not about having a million people

500
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:09,200
behind you and honestly you know there's that often cited often cited number of like you need

501
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,440
two percent of the mass to have a critical mass to do something i think it's even less than that now

502
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:19,760
considering we have relatively stable telecommunication systems right the message can be amplified so

503
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:26,480
much quicker now and so your community extends beyond geographic boundaries and then what also

504
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:32,080
gives me hope is communications really trying to use asset based communications because

505
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:37,760
that really flips the narrative it goes from deficit and scarcity which is what is used in

506
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,080
propaganda and news and media to really feel like we don't have what we need but we do know

507
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:51,920
what we need and we do have what we need and it's just again trying to create narratives even the most

508
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:57,760
well-intentioned circles like charities will say we need more volunteers because there's too many

509
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:03,920
poor hungry homeless folks and i yes but we could also state it in a different way that really

510
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:12,240
empowers people by saying we have the resources to house feed and uplift everyone join us in this

511
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,600
movement it really you know lands emotionally different in people and it might instigate action

512
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:23,440
no matter how big or small i think it's this weird world is small and big at the same time and people

513
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:30,240
do not fit into it but just pick something if it's safe enough to try go for it i think this

514
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:36,480
at least in the us the academic system that many of us go through really kind of pushes for perfection

515
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,800
and if it's not going to work don't do it at all but i'm trying to push back against that myself

516
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:49,440
and not be stuck in this cerebral space of just like despair so that's my take on it one of the

517
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:57,040
things that really makes me study this and makes me like want to be a human at this time is the

518
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:02,000
fact that there's no guarantee that we make it through this bottleneck or these bottlenecks

519
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,520
of the coming decades which is like there's a sense of danger in that and it's kind of scary

520
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:15,360
but at the same time that's what makes it exciting and then also there are like human experiences

521
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:23,440
that at an embodied level i have felt and i know like for example i love jujitsu i love training

522
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,640
when obviously not when i'm traveling but when i'm back in a stable environment

523
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:36,880
and there's something about that combat and exerting yourself so strenuously that after it

524
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,280
you're steaming up and there's just sweat pouring off you and the endorphins that are released at

525
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:46,320
the end of that and the conversations that are subsequently had with the friends that you have

526
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:51,920
made in the gym there's a comradeship there that is just a beautiful feeling and so

527
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,760
to maintain hope in this situation i know that that's that's like intrinsically rewarding and

528
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,960
valuable and there's there's no amount of theory that's gonna refute that for me i know that that

529
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,640
is valuable and so i say to myself okay this is worth preserving so and then i bounce out and i

530
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,360
as Priscilla said i try to gain a perspective and i say okay across time i would like to preserve

531
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,400
this if that's possible how do i go about doing that and then the how do i go about doing that is

532
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:26,960
the challenge that's the exciting part and there's no guarantee that we win but why not give it our

533
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,680
best shot is how i'm thinking about it so so building on that you mentioned jujitsu

534
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:41,360
priscilla mentioned a couple things maybe each of you could expand a little bit on the practices or

535
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,000
uh meditations or skills or new behaviors that you've incorporated in your personal life

536
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:56,320
as a response to your own understanding of of the metacrisis the great simplification and

537
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:03,920
how all these things interrelate um yeah so for me understanding the metacrisis

538
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,920
i had to realize that i had several behaviors and ways of thinking that i took for granted but

539
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:17,120
which were actively reinforcing the superorganism so over the last year i've tried to adopt

540
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:23,200
lifestyle choices and behavior choices which i can imagine as being more characteristic of a

541
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:31,520
more sustainable system so firstly i really tried to move away from this constant craving for more

542
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,280
and more more and more stuff more and more stimulation and that's a constant battle

543
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:44,800
but i've tried very hard to actively slow down my pace of life to value quality over quantity

544
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:49,040
and to remove as many distractions as possible so that i can focus on the present and what we have

545
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:55,600
and that's been helped through meditation through getting off social media and just yeah actively

546
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:01,200
creating space and time for silence and for silent reflection and learning to actually

547
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:08,240
crave the silence rather than the stimulation um so i really enjoyed that and then learning to

548
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:13,040
take joy and pleasure out of stuff that comes for free i realized that previously a lot of the stuff

549
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:19,600
i found fun was in some way associated with consumption whereas now um i take a lot of

550
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:24,640
pleasure out of things like time in nature i love going on long walks time with friends and family

551
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:30,880
an interesting conversation and dancing and writing and trying to incorporate those things

552
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:38,160
into my daily life and then in terms of mindset changes i've had a big change related to nature

553
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,560
primarily through food because like james i also love food and i've been putting a lot of more

554
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:50,320
intention and awareness behind what i'm putting in my body and where it comes from and i'm so lucky

555
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:56,480
that i live in an amazing part of the world with amazing local produce but this

556
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:01,600
sort of intention behind what i'm putting in my body has made me realize that my health is

557
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:07,440
totally tethered to the health of nature and of earth's ecosystems and my actions are impacting

558
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,200
that health and that has given me such a profound respect for nature and for all forms of life

559
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:17,920
right now when i look out the window i see life in the tree i don't just see a tree

560
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,800
and that's a very different mindset to oh i should make the environmentally friendly choice

561
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:28,880
because of climate change so that's been a mindset a big mindset shift for me and then

562
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:35,520
the other one i just want to touch on briefly is moving away from closed-minded in-group out-group

563
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:43,120
thinking um so i really tried to actively seek out and engage in conversations with people who

564
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:49,360
have opinions i disagree with and who come from different backgrounds or beliefs and going into

565
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:55,920
those conversations with the attitude that i want to learn as much as possible and i'm open

566
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,640
to the idea that i'm wrong and i'm gonna update my opinion based on that conversation and that

567
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:06,240
also has been a big a big mindset shift for me um and it's really taught me to be a lot more open

568
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,560
minded and to realize that i am basically wrong about everything uh yeah and i do think overall

569
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,200
the more i learn about the metacrisis and the more i develop sort of a nuanced understanding of it

570
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:27,040
i do think it comes down to a shift in consciousness um so yeah i try to live the change i want to see

571
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,520
in the world and hopefully can inspire some people to do the same because if we all collectively do

572
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:38,240
that then it triggers change higher up let me ask you uh put you on the spot natasha do you think

573
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:45,360
there's something unique in your um situation or your genetics or your upbringing or are the

574
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:53,520
changes you made that you just described um easily adaptable by people watching this episode uh that

575
00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:01,280
are 23 and having similar thoughts i think that definitely these changes can be adopted by anyone

576
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:11,120
um what i will say is because i've thought a lot about this um what i think is unique in my

577
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:20,880
upbringing is that i was exposed from a young age to very high level conversations um my grandparents

578
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:27,360
lived in this little town in south of france which was like this hub of international academics

579
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:33,600
and creatives and uh yeah film directors and artists so from a young age i'd be at dinner

580
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:39,440
parties with like Nobel prize winners uh and that was normal to me and so i learnt from a young age

581
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:48,000
should i crave that learning uh and to want to be more interested in learning something new

582
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:55,520
than in whatever i believed in i think that's led me to where i am now because my involvement in this

583
01:00:55,520 --> 01:01:00,240
space and this work was in no way predicated by me being like a tree hugging hippie or a radical

584
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:06,880
anarchist or whatever um it's purely from that craving for knowledge and then when finding that

585
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:12,720
knowledge that makes sense being willing to incorporate that so i think anyone can make

586
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:20,960
these changes um but it's about being willing and open to to finding out something new and the idea

587
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:26,000
that you're that everything you might have taken for granted and believed up to that point is wrong

588
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,960
thank you uh what like what are some practices or meditation or are new things that you have

589
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:39,040
incorporated into your personal life after integrating this into your mental uh view of the future

590
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,840
a very basic thing is something danios mochenberger mentioned at the norskan foundation he said

591
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,560
curate your social media feed so that the sorts of things that crop up are related to this like

592
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:53,120
the stock home institute planetary boundaries framework that sort of a thing and that's actually

593
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,400
that really works because i find myself going to my phone and then seeing this stuff late at night

594
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,600
and my head is like no i don't want to study that anymore i'm too tired so then i'll just put the phone

595
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:11,200
down put another thing that helps me sometimes i think of this knowledge as like a burden

596
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:17,600
sometimes i frame it in that sort of a way and i say oh my god why do i have to know all this why

597
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:23,760
do i have to be here in this time when all you and me both brother yeah when the shit's hitting the

598
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:30,640
fan and it's chaotic and it's too multuous but then i say to myself okay useless you're here now so

599
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:36,640
let's just be here and see what we can do about this and i sort of recalibrate or reframe in my

600
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:42,000
mind how i see it and i say to myself all right this is probably one of the biggest um the human

601
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,360
predicament the metacrisis uh slaying the super organism whatever you want to say is probably one

602
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:54,640
of the biggest challenges that humans across the whole of our evolutionary history has ever had to

603
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:02,240
face have to have ever had to face so to me that's quite um motivating and i say to myself okay so

604
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,800
either you step up to this challenge and make something of yourself so that you can

605
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,640
address it in whatever way possible and try to make that addressing it as big as possible

606
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,520
because i remember i actually mentioned something like doing the gardening and stuff like this and

607
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:22,080
don't get me wrong i love all that and i'm here doing the regenerative agriculture stuff but at

608
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:28,720
the same time i think there needs to be like agents of change who are so disproportionate in

609
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:36,960
terms of the consequences of their decisions or choices or actions that they they're in a position

610
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:45,040
of power that they can make those disproportionate um changes happen the whatever decisions they make

611
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:52,080
have highly are highly consequential we need to also figure out how to find ourselves in those

612
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:57,760
positions and i guess they're just a concern comes up it's like okay you you'd want to know

613
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:03,600
what you're talking about and what you're at when you're doing that so that also is quite inspiring

614
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:09,440
for me building off what others have said about phone use i think it's a very powerful tool

615
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,200
i myself have started to use social media more as i got older and going back to that generational

616
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,760
thing sometimes i look at gen alpha because i'm gen z and i'm like oh god we're fucked because

617
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:24,560
you're ipad kids but i also have to think like i don't blame you for wanting to dissociate on your

618
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:30,240
phone because the world's a scary place i dissociate on my phone too i'm subject to that habit as well

619
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:36,800
but in my role as a communicator for my day job as a friend as a neighbor i'm not going to post

620
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:41,680
something unless there's a sense of agency that you can gain from it her writing avenues and

621
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:47,200
pathways that then take action i think it's good to affirm and put out some really emotionally

622
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:53,360
charged content but i don't want to be a click to this you know where you become complacent and

623
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:58,000
complicit just because you posted something online and think yep i've done my part i also

624
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,560
don't want to rage farm you know that that's a term rage farming you're just fueling the

625
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:07,920
fire without really directing people to any channel of action so that's one rule i've

626
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,440
held myself accountable to yes affirm people but also try to provide agency where you can when

627
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:21,040
you're doing your stuff online and i think it's it's funny this ironic momentum around

628
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:28,480
reindigenizing right there's the the sense that people want to go back to the land and

629
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,880
live simpler lives and like really change the culture and now today and throughout recent

630
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:40,320
history certain advocates of that especially indigenous folks global south folks people of

631
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:44,800
color all other communities that have been socially disadvantaged or marginalized in the

632
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:48,880
past like that's stuff they've been doing forever but also you know to counterbalance

633
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,960
that with not painting a monolith right i don't think we have to look too far and many

634
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,960
for my observations i've noticed many immigrant families in the us who come here and fully embrace

635
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,640
and get ensconced in the american dream they are fully in survival mode they're they are just trying

636
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:09,440
to make as much money climb the ladder and that's a capitalist mindset and then they give birth to

637
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,960
children like me who are very against that so it's very complicated depending where you live the

638
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:19,840
privileges you have it's a privilege to be having these types of conversations but i think

639
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,840
when i am in a space to have these conversations i'm really trying to cultivate

640
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:29,600
facilitation skills how to hold effective meetings how to make everyone feel seen and heard in a

641
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:35,440
conversation for effective governance decision decision making models and i really think that's

642
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:40,160
scalable i think that's going to be pretty key to understanding the crises and then how to address

643
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,360
them because right now no matter what type enterprise you're in or workplace you're in

644
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:51,920
i think there's room to improve for facilitating effective like congregations of people to then

645
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:57,840
come to consent or consensus around certain issues and values then to move forward with that so

646
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,960
really if i'm asking people to change then i have to embody that change myself and again it's not

647
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,200
about being perfect it's just about being authentic and within your realms within the privileges you

648
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:16,320
hold thank you and thank you to all three of you for putting in the time to learn this stuff and

649
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:22,240
be willing to be on camera to to share some thoughts is there is there any question that you

650
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:31,280
would have liked me to ask that you'd like to close with some some comments or anything else

651
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:36,800
that each of you would like to say to our viewers no i do just want to briefly say that if there

652
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:43,200
are young people watching this who are getting exposed to this content it can be really scary

653
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:50,080
and tough if you don't have people to talk to about it so hopefully as you said Nate there's

654
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:56,560
going to be like a discord channel by the time this is out but speaking for me personally i'd

655
01:07:56,560 --> 01:08:02,400
be very happy to chat to anyone who feels like they're going through this cognitive journey by

656
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:09,360
themselves so just putting that out there yes i also want to plug the emotional container model

657
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:16,240
you do really need to hold space for people to process this and i'm proud of the work that i've

658
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:20,400
done with my peers when we founded a non-profit called the Overstory Alliance and out of that

659
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:25,280
game movement school and it really was about educating and then providing a space review

660
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:30,400
to process and then providing perhaps an avenue for them people to manifest whatever change they

661
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:33,920
want they're interested in you're interested in chicken coop go do that you're interested in

662
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,080
building furniture go do that if you're interested in becoming part of the system changing from

663
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,920
within that's okay too but yeah really emphasizing the emotional container key to preserving yourself

664
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,080
and not burning out closing remarks i can't really say much to be honest what i would say is

665
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:58,800
because i'm not sure what it was within me that made me realize oh no that's not quite true don't

666
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:04,480
believe that or don't fall into that trap maybe there's something sort of innate to humans that

667
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:10,720
can guide us like that and i would say listen to that inner voice that guides you in that way

668
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:16,960
and don't betray it don't betray it not for money nor for people in your life who would convince you

669
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,520
that no no no this is the way to see the world i'd just say yeah stay true to that inner voice

670
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:27,680
i i didn't persil i don't even know if you know this but i almost called my class at the university

671
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:33,600
of minnesota things you always knew but never knew you knew but it was too convoluted and long so

672
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,680
i called it reality 101 instead yeah persil after you left nate you know a few of us adapted your

673
01:09:39,680 --> 01:09:43,760
course to become another seminar led by students for students and we titled it what to do about a

674
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:49,200
fucked up world and we just live with humor a humor does a great service to people in healing

675
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:56,960
and navigating and honestly we live in the age of memes so why not yeah thank you all young humans
