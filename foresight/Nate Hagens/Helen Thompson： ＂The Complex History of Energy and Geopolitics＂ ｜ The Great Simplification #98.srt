1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
There are so many contingencies, particularly actually on the geopolitical side, that can

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,360
derail what seem to be passive development at any one time. And it's a strange...

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,040
And this is what I think it's hard to think about, because on the one hand it is systemic,

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:22,320
but on the other hand, it is vulnerable to contingent events.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,080
Today's guest is Professor Helen Thompson. Helen works at Cambridge University, where she

6
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,880
researches the political economy of energy and the long history that underpins the democratic,

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:44,160
economic, and geopolitical disruptions that we are seeing now in the 21st century. Her most

8
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:52,160
recent book, Disorder, hard times in the 21st century, is kind of a political science

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:01,280
mirror twin of the logic of the great simplification. Today we talk about the history of the United

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:10,240
States in the Middle East, Israel and Hamas and Qatar, Ukraine and Russia, the importance of energy

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:18,160
in the history of the world, and some speculation on what's ahead. Please welcome Professor Helen

12
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:35,280
Thompson. Hi Helen, great to see you. Hi Nate, good to see you too. Although we've never met in

13
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,440
person, maybe I should call you Professor Thompson. No, call me Helen. So you have an impressive

14
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:51,440
economic, political, science background covering history, energy, economics, politics, and much

15
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,120
more. Can you just give a brief introduction, and how did you first get interested in these

16
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:04,640
topics all the way back to college or high school, or what was your path? Not a tour really. I basically

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:18,240
got seriously interested in energy in I think 2013. And I came at it via really the monetary

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,840
environment of the post-2008 world. And I was sufficiently, I wouldn't say aware about energy

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,760
questions, but I was sufficiently aware of the macroeconomic implications of energy

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,560
to understand that there was a relationship between the post-2008 monetary environment,

21
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,400
quantitative easing, zero interest rates, and the shale boom in the US. And to understand that the

22
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
world economy needed shale oil, I wouldn't say that my understanding was much better than that

23
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:58,720
at that point. But I was trying to work out what I might write as a long book project for

24
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,600
academically that turned out not to materialize for various reasons. And I kept thinking, you know

25
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,280
what, I'm going to have to bring oil into this. And I kept trying to work out a way of doing what

26
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,640
I wanted to do about the crash and about the eurozone crisis, and bring oil into it. And then I

27
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,800
realized that was completely the wrong way to think about things and that I just needed to go in like

28
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,520
via oil. So I started trying to think about how I might write a short book by this point about

29
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:33,040
the macroeconomic consequences of what I now believe to be a serious oil problem for the world

30
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,320
economy. But I quickly understood that in order to think about that, I needed to think about

31
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:43,920
geopolitics in a way which I'd never really done before, not in any sharply incisive way anyway.

32
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,840
So I try to teach myself to think geopolitically around this time as well. And things have really

33
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,600
moved from there. I mean, the only thing I would add to that is I'm a child of the 70s. I was born

34
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:08,160
in 1967 in Britain. My first memory of national life in Britain is the winter of 1974, sitting around

35
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,920
at home, seven years old, my mother trying to cook in the dark evening after evening,

36
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,200
with two small children, candlelight. So I understood in a quite visual sense in a way

37
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:29,280
that energy had a profound impact or could have a profound impact on daily life. And I never lost

38
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,360
that. But I wouldn't say that until some point after 2013, I connected that in any way to what I

39
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,240
was trying to do as a scholar. I have a ton of questions for you, as you might imagine. Could

40
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,760
you give a one or two minute elevator pitch of your latest book Disorder Hard Times in the 21st

41
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,600
century? So what I really wanted to do in Disorder was try to explain the political shocks of the

42
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,320
2010s, with which people obviously were very familiar, not least in Britain and the United

43
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,200
States, because high on the list of shocks of that year were obviously Brexit, or were seen to be

44
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:13,200
anyway, Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and to give them a long history. And I didn't think

45
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,880
that they were just episodes, if you like, of psychodrama in British politics or American

46
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,440
politics. I thought that each of those two things had more of a structural explanation than that.

47
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:33,840
And I wanted to run with the thought that actually, if I started thinking seriously

48
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,840
and systematically about these events having an energy history, that I will be able to get

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,920
somewhere in explaining them that more conventional accounts wouldn't. Now, I'm not enough of an energy

50
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,560
determinist where politics is concerned to think that energy explains absolutely everything. And

51
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,200
indeed, if I had thought that I probably wouldn't have spent time in the third part of Disorder,

52
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,240
writing about democracies quite in the way in which I do. But I wanted also to grapple with

53
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,480
what I see as the longstanding historical problems that representative democracy faces

54
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,040
as a form of government. And I thought there were some things, particularly actually in relation to

55
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,880
the United States and its history as a domestic oil producer, where it was possible to say that

56
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,400
there was a story to be told about the American Republic and what was going on in oil politics

57
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:33,440
as well. So my book kind of tries to say, look, we should have expected the disorder of the 2010s

58
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,040
because there were these significant structural forces at work centered around not only the

59
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,360
problems of fossil fuel energy, but the difficulties of the energy transition, the geopolitics of the

60
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,760
energy transition. And then unless we could understand those things, we won't get really

61
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,160
anywhere in understanding the economic, political and geopolitical world in which we live.

62
00:06:53,120 --> 00:07:00,000
So I'm glad we're finally having a conversation on camera. My work, as you know,

63
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,280
focuses around the concept of energy blindness in finance, in economic theory, and in broader

64
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:14,720
culture. And it's always refreshing to talk to someone who sees not energy as everything,

65
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,480
but energy in everything like I do in a different field. So you're a political scientist and a

66
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:30,560
political economist in your academic stripes. Are your fields political science? Is that

67
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,160
energy blind as well? And is that changing? I'd say that political science is energy blind largely.

68
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:46,960
I'd say that political economy has a more complicated relationship to this. I think

69
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,640
if you go back to the 1970s and the political economy that came out of the 1970s, indeed,

70
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:59,200
some of the stuff that, say, I was taught as an undergraduate, I don't think it was energy blind.

71
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,280
I think that political economy was relatively energy aware, not necessarily in the

72
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,400
system dynamics of energy, but the economic and geopolitical importance of energy.

73
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,320
And then it lost that awareness. I think it kind of lost the awareness at the same time in a way

74
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:24,560
in which the politicians in Western countries lost their awareness. So sometime, and I struggle

75
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,320
sometimes to think, to know where I think this began, it was the late 80s or sometime in the

76
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:37,920
90s when I think then an energy blindness took over. I think in political economy over the last

77
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:46,400
few years, there is quite a bit of evidence that actually at least some people are getting serious

78
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:54,240
about energy again. And I've had a lot less difficulty explaining to people since my book,

79
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:00,960
this book came out, this longer book Disorder, why energy is as important as I'm presenting it to

80
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:07,520
be. When I wrote this short book called Oil on the Western Economic Crisis, which came out in 2017,

81
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
then I still think most people thought, why is she writing about that?

82
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:20,080
Well, it didn't hurt the tailwinds for your book that it came out the exact same time that Putin

83
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:26,560
invaded Ukraine. No, I mean, in the UK, it came out on the actual day of the invasion.

84
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,320
Oh my gosh. So that was a strange experience in itself. But there were things that I was saying

85
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,040
that suddenly people who weren't particularly interested in energy and I think didn't think

86
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,880
they wanted to be interested in energy suddenly would tell me that they were reading it and they

87
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,240
would say, oh, that makes sense. And I give you one clear example of that was what I wrote about

88
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,960
the Suez Crisis. And I spent a lot of time thinking about the Suez Crisis trying to offer a somewhat

89
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:59,920
different interpretation than certainly we usually get in Britain. And I remember when I was writing

90
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,560
that chapter, and I just took the decision one day that I was actually going to make it the structural

91
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,080
pivot of the second geopolitical chapter. And I thought this could go very wrong. I mean, people

92
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,880
would just think that it's some kind of apology for British imperialism. And then because of what

93
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,840
was happening with Ukraine and the pipelines and the issue of transit and these big shifts,

94
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,240
then almost everybody who was asking me questions in the first few weeks after the book came out

95
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,680
in the UK wanted to talk to me about the Suez Crisis. I'm going to jump around a bit, Helen,

96
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:39,280
but since you brought that up, could you briefly describe the Suez Crisis and speculate on whether

97
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:46,320
we're going to have another one? Yeah, I mean, the second part of that's a really very interesting

98
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,600
question. I think that what's important to see from the British point of view, which I'll start with,

99
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:02,640
on the Suez Crisis, is that in 1956, when the British took military action with France and Israel

100
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:11,920
against Egypt in the light of NASA and the Egyptian president nationalising the company that owned

101
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:19,760
Suez Canal, in the British government mine, the British were doing exactly what they were supposed

102
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,480
to do in the post-second world war, which was to act as an imperial power in the Middle East

103
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,400
to guarantee the oil security of Western European countries. Because American presidents were very

104
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:38,560
clear in the post-war second world war world, they wanted largely the oil of the Western hemisphere

105
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,760
for the Western hemisphere, obviously not least the United States itself. They were only willing to

106
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,640
provide oil to Western Europe countries in an emergency. They didn't really want Western European

107
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:55,120
countries buying oil from the Soviet Union, certainly once the Cold War got going, that

108
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,040
meant Western European countries and Japan needed to import oil from the Middle East and they didn't

109
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,240
want to have any military responsibility in the Middle East for ensuring the free flow of oil

110
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,520
through the Persian Gulf. That was the British job. Obviously they didn't want the British

111
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,520
behaving in brazen ways like an imperial power that made it very difficult for them with Arab

112
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,560
states, but nonetheless, if there was a threat to Western European energy security, then Britain

113
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,120
was supposed to act as an imperial power and do something about it, which is what British did in

114
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,640
the autumn of 1956 and then Eisenhower obviously up for re-election didn't want that kind of display

115
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:41,520
of European imperialism, particularly at a time when the Soviet Union was sending tanks into

116
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:50,160
Budapest and put such financial pressure on the British government, financial pressure that was

117
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,720
made possible by Britain's desperate need now to find dollars to buy American oil because

118
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,680
the Arab states were boycotting the sale of oil through one of the pipelines and the Suez canal

119
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,520
was closed, that it was very easy for Eisenhower to tell the British Prime Minister Antony Eden,

120
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,480
you're out. With the British not being able to continue neither could the French and neither

121
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,120
ultimately could the Israelis. If we just look at it for a moment from the Israeli

122
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:27,920
point of view, what that showed in 1956 was how vulnerable that they were on transit issues

123
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,960
and that was both about the Suez canal itself, but it was also about the Strait of Turan,

124
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:40,720
which is like water that gets them up the eastern side of the Sinai Peninsula and made

125
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,480
it possible, would make it possible in time for Iran to sell oil to Israel and that became

126
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:56,800
a really central issue for Israel, including then in 1967 when NASA closed the Strait of Turan

127
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,600
again and then kept the Suez canal closed for eight years, the second time.

128
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
So what happened then during those eight years, the ships had to go all the way around?

129
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:15,280
Yeah, I mean if it wasn't coming pipeline, it has to go all the way around Africa and

130
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:21,360
interestingly in that context that is part of the reason then why from 1967 the British

131
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,600
government concludes it can no longer stay in the Middle East, it can no longer carry on being an

132
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:32,400
imperial power there because suddenly the the oil costs that Britain faces in the wake of the

133
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:36,960
Six Day War where it's also subject to a embargo, a much greater.

134
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:44,880
So in addition to culture being energy blind, it's possible that energy experts and

135
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:52,560
culture are geopolitics and complexity blind. I mean can you imagine, I'm sure you can,

136
00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:00,320
you're an expert on this, the importance of the Suez canal and the Strait of Hormuz as being open

137
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:09,120
and free and navigable for the rest of the world just in time things and both of those are within

138
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,320
the arena of the current conflict. I think most people don't even think about those important

139
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,440
choke points. No, I mean obviously this raises the second part of your question. I mean if we

140
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,240
look at Israel's position in this though, there's been a really quite substantial change

141
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:36,240
from the situation either in 1956 for Israel or in 1967. So in the aftermath of the Suez

142
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:46,480
crisis through to the Iranian Revolution in 1979, then Iran was the principal exporter of oil

143
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,880
to Israel. None of the Arab states were willing to sell oil to Israel. The United States was

144
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:01,760
operating with its not exports accepting an emergency. So the only state really that was

145
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:14,160
willing to sell oil to Israel on a contracted basis was with the Iranians. And that was one of

146
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:21,600
the reasons why in 1967 that NASA blockaded the Straits of Tehran because he wanted to stop

147
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,040
Iran selling oil to Israel. He thought that that was a fundamental weakness of the Islamic world

148
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:37,760
in dealing with Israel back in 1967. But then when we get to the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution,

149
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,560
although that there's some covert selling of oil by Iran to Israel, this time like through a land

150
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:53,280
pipeline rather than through the Straits of Tehran, Israel starts looking for other options.

151
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:59,040
It gets a guarantee from the Americans that in an absolute emergency the Americans will provide

152
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,080
oil. But if we look at who is the number one exporter of oil to Israel today, it's Azerbaijan.

153
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,360
It comes via like pipeline that the vulnerability for Israel in that is actually Turkey's position

154
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:19,360
because the pipeline's coming through Turkey. In terms of the relationship between the Israeli

155
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,120
government and the Azerbaijani government, it's quite strong. Israel's also selling arms

156
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,040
to Azerbaijan. But it's the transit. It's the transit through Turkey that is probably on that

157
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:39,440
respect, Israel's vulnerability. So let's put a pin in that. 1979 was a key year in the Middle

158
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:46,160
East because Egypt recognized Israel. The Shah of Iran was overthrown. Israel gave up its oil

159
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:54,720
in Sinai as a part of developing better relations with Egypt. And the Iranian Revolution then cut

160
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,640
off Israel from oil supply that the Shah had provided, as you mentioned. So you've observed

161
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,600
that these events made the USSR somewhat irrelevant in that part of the world until the

162
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,800
Syrian civil war 30 years later, 40 years later. Is there a parallel between the Abraham Accords

163
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:24,080
in which Saudi Arabia was poised to join the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco in normalizing relations with

164
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,960
Israel earlier this year? And Iran now feeling potentially less relevant in the Middle East

165
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:38,000
in the same way Russia became after 1979? I think there are possibly some parallels here.

166
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:45,440
I think that there's, well, I think that there's a paradox, which I don't still think I really

167
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,720
have got to grips with in trying to understand the events of the last few weeks. Because if we

168
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,440
think about the course of the last few years, in particularly actually the first part of this year,

169
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,440
we could see two different things, at least two different things, really opposite things going

170
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,280
on. The first of them, as you said, Nate, was the possibility, the strong possibility it would seem

171
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,160
that the Abraham Accords were going to be extended to Saudi Arabia. And at that point,

172
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:24,240
you could see that actually not only was Israel going to be able to normalize relations with a

173
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,280
growing number of Arab states, including now the most significant one, but that that was quite

174
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,600
complementary to various of the economic relations, including energy relations that Israel was

175
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,560
cultivating with Arab states, not least being able to do so, because since some point in the 2010s,

176
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:49,120
Israel has been able to export, I think it's from 2017, has been able to export gas from its offshore

177
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:58,960
eastern Mediterranean gas fields, and two of the states that it exports to have been Jordan

178
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:06,240
and Egypt. You've also got UAE involvement in at least one of those gas fields. So you could see

179
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,680
that there was a kind of, not economic unity would be going too far, but economic interdependence

180
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:18,560
growing between Israel and various of the Arab states takes Saudi Arabia into that. That is a

181
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,360
big deal, a really big deal. And in one sense transformative, I think, from Israel's point of

182
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:33,280
view. And then you might say, well, Iran shut out of that, no possibility of that kind of

183
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,520
relationship between Israel and Iran tries to sabotage it, though that runs into the issue of

184
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,080
whether they really did know that Hamas was going to attack. But on the other hand, if you look

185
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,320
up to what was going on this year, is you had the rapprochement, the diplomatic rapprochement

186
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,520
between Saudi Arabia and Iran, brokered it would seem on the surface anyway, by the Chinese,

187
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,920
perhaps United Arab Emirates played some part, perhaps Putin played some part. So actually,

188
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:10,560
you had growing Saudi, apparently anyway, growing Saudi Iranian relations or defrosting, let's say,

189
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,680
relations during the same period in which Iran might not like it's been left out of the Abraham

190
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,200
Accords. And I still think trying to understand how both those things were going on at the same

191
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:29,440
time, I still think that's a bit of a puzzle. Is it possible? I am absolutely no expert here,

192
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:38,000
which is why I'm asking you. But there has been obviously tribal conflicts in humanity back to

193
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,520
the Pleistocene. But a big one is between the Shia and Sunni factions of the Muslim

194
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:53,760
faith. Is it possible that the aversion to the West, the United States, Israel,

195
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:04,320
is enough an aversion that it could unite some of the previous antagonistic tribes in the area?

196
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,840
And it could be Middle East, Asia versus the West from this current conflict. Do you have

197
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:21,920
any thoughts on that? I think that that is quite hard to imagine or at least not to see that the

198
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:30,560
fault lines would assert themselves quite quickly. I mean, I give you one like example,

199
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:38,880
is the complete difficulty that the Bush administration had persuading the Saudis that

200
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,560
they had to make some kind of accommodation with post Saddam's Iraq, once the Shia majority were

201
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:55,680
the dominant political force in Iraq. And in that sense, it was easier for the Saudis to have,

202
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,000
I wouldn't say necessarily straightforwardly positive relations with the United States,

203
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,520
but at least complicated relations with the United States that had some payoff potentially for each

204
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:15,280
side, then it was to reestablish Iraq-Saudi relations in the post Saddam era. I think as well

205
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:24,960
that if you look at the internal politics of a number of Arab countries, including now like

206
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:34,480
Egypt as well, the idea that they really want to make common cause with Hamas, both in its

207
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,480
relationship to the Muslim Brotherhood, who obviously were in power in Egypt from 2011-2013,

208
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:49,280
but also then around support for Hamas, that's I think pretty destabilizing prospect in Egyptian

209
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,760
politics. So I think we always have got a factor into this, like what the risks around domestic

210
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:03,120
political stability are for any of the Arab states in their relations, not only with Iran,

211
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:12,640
but also with the Palestinian cause. The Palestinian cause is obviously prominent in

212
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,560
everyday news right now. This is recorded on Monday, October 30th. Obvious to those people that

213
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:28,400
understand the centrality of energy to our world, the effects of the Israel Hamas situation have

214
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,360
clear consequences for the availability of oil globally, something like half to two thirds of

215
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:43,840
the world's oil reserves are within 800 miles of Israel. But how is this conflict taken a bird's

216
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:51,760
eye view, especially during the late 20th century? How is the energy at the center of this

217
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,840
current conflict? Can you give a stratospheric view of that?

218
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:09,600
Well, I think there are several different things going on here. The first of them is that

219
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,960
Iran's position in the Persian Gulf, and to some extent its relationship with China

220
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:28,400
around the Persian Gulf are pretty central to any question about the conflict between Israel

221
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:36,400
and Hamas, spelling out into an original conflict or original war. And I think that there's a way

222
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:43,360
of thinking about that question that actually goes back to the summer of 2019, which is actually

223
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:53,040
where I started disorder. Because there we saw what happened when Iran responded to what Trump

224
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:59,440
called the maximum economic pressure being applied after Trump had entered the Iran nuclear deal with

225
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,560
various attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf. Then there was the attacks probably by Iranian

226
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,680
proxies on the Saudi oil facilities, Saudi defense system essentially failed.

227
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,080
And then it looked like the Americans, even under Trump, weren't going to make any response to that,

228
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:25,360
which made the Saudis incredibly angry. And then in January of 2020, so just as the pandemic was

229
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:32,720
starting in China, we had Trump ordering the assassination of Soleimani, the head of the Iranian

230
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,640
Revolutionary Guard. And the response of a lot of Trump's critics to that was he's so mad, he's

231
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:46,000
just about to start like World War Three. So even in the quite recent years with pandemic got in

232
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
the way of people, I think remembering what was going on in the second half of 2019 and early 2020,

233
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:59,120
we can see that conflict in the Persian Gulf has got the potential to be incredibly destabilizing.

234
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,600
And so any, for any conflict that moves into regional war in the Middle East, that is

235
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,680
will be central to it. How are we going to avoid a major war in the Middle East?

236
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:24,640
I mean, what would be the, I think you don't need to paint the worst case. Worst case is

237
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:31,840
nukes all around the world. You don't even need to paint the bad case, which is the Strait of

238
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:40,880
Hormuz closes and there's giant bombs and destruction in Middle Eastern countries. What

239
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,400
would be a somewhat benign and a hopeful outcome of the current situation?

240
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:54,960
I think the benign version is that the presence of the American Navy in the way in which it is

241
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:04,640
now in the Mediterranean is sufficient deterrent to Iran to ensure that Hezbollah stays out of

242
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:12,240
anything, doing anything particularly significant in northern Israel. And Iran understood stands

243
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:21,920
that there would be very direct consequences for it if it were to engage in, even in maybe even

244
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:28,640
the kind of action that it engaged in the summer of 2019 in the Strait of Hormuz.

245
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,880
A lot of times when there's, and here's me saying this to a political scientist expert,

246
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,680
it seems like there's a conflict between a country and another country. But here it's like this

247
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,360
complicated rat's nest of multiple countries and multiple groups and demographics and

248
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,200
initiatives. I mean, there's Lebanon, there's Syria, there's Russian support there, there's Iran,

249
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:04,320
there's Hezbollah, there's Hamas, there's all kinds of Houthi rebels. And it seems like there are

250
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,760
tiny little Archduke Ferdinand possibilities everywhere.

251
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:19,920
No, absolutely. But I think some of that, though, there's a positive story to tell about some of

252
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:28,480
the complexities of the interdependence. For instance, as I said earlier, Israel exports

253
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,200
gas now, at least it has been to Jordan and to Egypt. That means that these are countries that

254
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:45,280
have got something to lose from conflict with Israel in a way which has never historically

255
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:54,000
been true before the 2010s when this offshore Israeli gas production began. Now, there is some

256
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,680
difficulty for Egypt coming out of this. And unfortunately, it does have, I think, potential

257
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:05,200
ramifications for Europe, because one of the fields, the three main fields in the Eastern

258
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:13,920
Mediterranean that belong to Israel, Tamar is in the rocket range of Hamas. And so production is

259
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,880
shut down at the moment, which means that Egypt isn't getting the liquid natural gas exports

260
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,280
from Israel that it would usually do. It also exports itself because it has fields in the

261
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,640
Eastern Mediterranean. That means you'll be exporting less to Europe. And we know that European

262
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,200
demand for liquid natural gas is much higher than it was two years ago because of Russia's

263
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,400
war against Ukraine. And so these things become interconnected and disruptive.

264
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:49,920
So I'm an American and I remember what happened with President Bush and the war in Iraq.

265
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:57,920
And I have other memories of subsequent presidents. Can you outline the shifting

266
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:03,120
relationships and perspectives with the United States president's administrations

267
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:11,200
towards Saudi Arabia and the Middle East from Obama to Trump to currently Biden with the

268
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,920
fist bump to MBS or he refused to shake hands? But it seems like this is all an unfolding soap

269
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:23,440
opera with massive consequences for our future. Yeah, I think you'd probably need to just start

270
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:32,480
with like where things were in the Bush Jr presidency. Let's say particularly by 2005.

271
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:44,480
So once it's clear that Iraq is going to be a quagmire at best and that if a crucial purpose

272
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:53,680
which to my mind it was of the Iraq war was to remove the sanctions from Iraq's oil exports,

273
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:01,680
rebuild the Iraqi oil industry, get international oil companies back into Iraq, turn Iraq into

274
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,760
a large-scale oil producer rather than as it had previously been before the sanctions a medium-sized

275
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,320
oil producer. So producing more like 10 or 11 million barrels a day like the Saudis could.

276
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,640
That wasn't going to work out. It's very clear by 2005. So what we see in 2005 and I think that

277
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:30,480
the shapes of a world that we still live in is essentially that world oil production stagnated.

278
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,800
And then into that in the 2010s came the shale oil boom in the United States and meant that

279
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,880
that stagnation of production that was there I think by 2005 and it was for a whole set of reasons

280
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,080
including geopolitical reasons didn't play out in the way in which it would have done otherwise.

281
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,000
So there was no way that George Bush could find a way out of the Middle East or even think that he

282
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,760
could find a way out of the Middle East. I think the Iraq war should be understood as trying to

283
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:10,880
address what that administration understood really quite well was the stagnation of production that

284
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,000
was coming in a world in which Asian demand in general and Chinese in particular was growing

285
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:25,040
quite rapidly. I think by the time that Obama has been in office a couple of years by 2011 probably

286
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,360
the people in the White House with him buy this idea that shale is the fix.

287
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:40,080
Now shale is a partial fix. It stops I think economically the 2010s being a lot more difficult

288
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,920
than they would otherwise have been but it isn't actually a route out of the United States from

289
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:51,680
the Middle East altogether. Not least because it's the question of like where the shale oil is

290
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:57,280
going to be refined and where the American refineries are themselves well suited to all the shale that's

291
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:03,920
being produced. So the United States isn't actually losing its need to import oil from the Middle

292
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,040
East. It's simply reducing its need to import oil from the Middle East but I think the Obama

293
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,360
administration is emboldened by shale. I think it does several things. It first of all thinks okay

294
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,560
we can now sanction Iran which they've been quite wary about because the Europeans will protest

295
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,000
the oil prices will go too high if too much Iranian oil is taken off the market. We sanction them,

296
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,600
we bring them to the table, we get a nuclear deal with Iran. The sanctions can come off,

297
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:37,680
we can normalize relations, largely normalize relations like with Iran. That will put the

298
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:42,880
Saudis in their place a bit too. We don't have to treat them so seriously as we've

299
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,840
as we've generally been doing since the 1970s because we don't need them so much

300
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:54,880
and obviously it doesn't turn out like that in terms of getting out of the Middle East not least

301
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:00,880
because ISIS comes along and then he's got American troops out of Iraq by 2012 but the

302
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:09,600
Air Force is going back in in 2014. Now Trump I think then comes in the exact opposite way of

303
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:15,360
well let's I use Trump as a shorthand because who knows who exactly was making all the decisions in

304
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:22,640
the Trump White House but comes in and he is like no we need to be close to the Saudis still

305
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:31,360
we need to be tough on Iran and so he's willing to be quite tolerant of most things to do with

306
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:39,040
MBS cultivates personal relationship probably get some payoff in terms of his own corporate

307
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:47,120
material interfamily interests but I think it's quite then revealing that even when Trump is

308
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:54,160
the president in the September of 2019 when those Saudi oil facilities are attacked that

309
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:03,760
the Americans don't actually make a response. I think Biden comes in then and he's back to

310
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,120
flipping it the other way and he's got an added component to it which is that he I think quite

311
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:17,760
desperately wants the Iran nuclear deal back because he wants Iranian more Iranian oil on the

312
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,120
world markets because he doesn't want to look like he's got an oil policy at all he wants his energy

313
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:31,120
policy to look like it's just about climate and the energy transition so Iran nuclear deal you

314
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:36,880
have to know something to understand that that's it oil policy but he's not able to but in that case

315
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:48,320
you just made the supposition that Biden cares more about appearing to be a climate president

316
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:58,480
rather than actually being one because he wants the US to use less oil but if more Iranian oil

317
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,160
is on the world market from a CO2 perspective that's more fossil carbon being burned right?

318
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,600
Yeah I mean I think there obviously are like levels of like complexity to that I mean you

319
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:22,560
might also say I mean you know I don't suppose to know how much deep thinking there has been

320
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,520
about this question inside the Biden White House you might also say that it's quite useful if you

321
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:37,600
really understand that might be a medium to long-term oil problem that actually you keep some American

322
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:44,160
production like back and let others like take this case so there's level draining America first

323
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,840
absolutely I don't think that's the deep thinking but maybe maybe it is

324
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:59,920
but what we know whatever thinking was going on the policy didn't work and so already by the summer

325
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:11,520
of 2021 he was having to ask the Saudis essentially to increase output which they weren't willing to do

326
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:22,800
he then made is rather humiliating visit to Riyadh in the next summer in 2022 and the Saudis

327
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:30,560
have shown no willingness really despite the fact of working with the administration about the Abraham

328
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:39,120
accords to accommodate the Biden administration's persistent desire for more oil output from OPEC

329
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:49,200
plus so what do you think about the fact that if you add UAE Saudi Arabia and the new BRICS

330
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:58,400
nations including Russia that the amount of oil purchasable in the open market not the oil

331
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:06,800
production but the available oil exports are now over 50 percent controlled by BRICS nations

332
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:17,440
first of all is that important and a related question I'm just curious from a political

333
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:26,400
perspective people living in those nations in the Middle East that are selling the stored sunlight

334
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:35,040
from beneath their lands to the global west and of course they're getting dollars or financial

335
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:44,080
remuneration for that but it's their legacy of what they have in their lands and it's being

336
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:50,880
sold to the west do the people there ever get patriotic and nationalistic about that I mean

337
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,240
what is the real feeling beneath the dollar signs and barrels of oil that are flowing

338
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:05,680
I mean on the first question I think that OPEC plus matters a lot more than the BRICS

339
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:14,800
okay I mean I think if you look at it in energy terms that India and China and and Brazil as

340
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:25,040
founders are in a very different position than Russia and I think that China has its own really

341
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:34,960
quite severe still constraints around its foreign oil and gas dependency and I think it's well aware

342
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:44,480
of those I think in this case the Chinese leadership really is energy aware yeah so I think that in

343
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:53,520
terms of is there a power block that would use energy as a weapon against western countries we

344
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:01,280
should think in terms of like OPEC plus and not think in terms of BRICS okay and I think you might

345
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:08,400
say that it then really is quite significant that the Saudi Russian axis in OPEC plus has held

346
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,880
through Russia's invasion of Ukraine indeed strengthened because if you go back to the

347
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:20,480
aftermath of those attacks on the Saudi oil facilities you pretty much had Putin laughing

348
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,200
at the Saudis about the fact that the air defense system that they bought from the United States

349
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:35,920
didn't work if you go to the spring of 2020 so when the pandemic really started you have been

350
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,600
salmon trying to flood the market with oil after you can't reach an agreement with Putin about how

351
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:47,680
to deal with the pandemic and then you effectively have Donald Trump putting OPEC plus back together

352
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,760
again because he doesn't want the price of oil on the floor for American shale producers and having

353
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,000
to threaten the Saudis like with military withdrawal or you know military less military support unless

354
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:08,880
that they play nice with him about that so I mean OPEC plus looks pretty like weak as any kind of

355
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:17,760
cohesive block in the spring of 2020 we're a long way away from that now OPEC plus can choose to

356
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,000
inflict harm on the Biden administration and I think chose to do so in the run up to those mid-term

357
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,320
elections last November when a quite substantial cut was announced just in the weeks before when

358
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:38,800
Biden had been pressing obviously for increased output. I was going to ask you this near the end

359
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:46,240
of the interview but I'll ask it right now given what you just said have we reached the point

360
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,280
or are we approaching a point where the rest of the world can decouple or de facto sanction the

361
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:01,280
US and other countries in the US orbit without it having disastrous effects on their own economies?

362
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:12,960
I think you can see that in Russia's case that it has been able to inflict quite substantial harm

363
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:21,600
on European countries and in particular Germany by cutting off the supply of gas through the

364
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:28,480
Nord Stream 1 pipeline which just began to do from the summer of 2022 if you look at the economic

365
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:35,920
data coming out of Germany over the last few months it's pretty difficult that Germany has

366
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:44,560
experienced a major industrial blow by what has happened and it's not clear that the Russian economy

367
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:53,040
has taken such a big hit for having done this certainly where oil is concerned it's been able

368
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,640
to sell pretty much the same amount of oil as it was previously doing for a reasonably long

369
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,200
period of time at a lower price than the market price but even that it's not clear that that's true

370
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:13,840
any longer it's been able to increase its liquid natural gas exports it obviously doesn't yet

371
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:20,640
compensate from those for what it's lost through selling through the the pipelines that the Yamaha

372
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,080
pipeline and the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to European countries but it's got the capacity

373
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:35,120
to increase LNG exports further I think the Saudi question is like more difficult because the

374
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:40,720
Saudis are obviously more integrated financially into the US world and the way that the Russians

375
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:46,000
were much less so since even just then since 2014 and certainly since those financial

376
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,960
sanctions and Saudi obviously has this does have a military relationship with the United States and

377
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:59,600
so that acts as some kind of constraint on what the Saudis can do too so it was three weeks ago

378
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:11,040
just over when the Hamas-Israel situation exploded and at that time I thought that the

379
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:22,960
implications would be a premium on long dated oil futures and instability to the financial system

380
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,200
and instead oil as of today three weeks later is about at the same level it was before that

381
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:40,080
happened maybe because you say the US Navy is suppressing volatility but I was surprised and

382
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:47,120
I don't like to talk about this much because you can get in in social trouble really easily but

383
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:53,840
since you're a professional in this domain it almost feels like this entire situation

384
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:01,920
unexpectedly to me and many people is like a Middle East version of a George Floyd moment

385
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:11,920
where there are people around the world reacting to what's happening and it it it seems like that

386
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:19,680
puts the international social contract of agreements and supply chains and geopolitical

387
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:30,160
alliances and everything that we kind of assumed would continue before October 2023 might might

388
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:37,680
change just because of this you know this this zeitgeist is is changing what do you think about

389
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:44,400
that Helen well I think there's definitely something going on in that respect I think that

390
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,800
particularly consequentially for the Biden administration just because the US is much more

391
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:59,040
important as a power than the European states although they face some of the same domestic

392
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,600
political issues around this they're going to come under considerable pressure and obviously in the

393
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:11,200
case of the United States with an election next year that is going to intensify that pressure

394
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:19,440
of how far they can go in supporting Israel without causing themselves very considerable

395
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,360
political problems I mean I think that it it is though aided by the fact that the energy

396
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:35,120
situation thus far is not particularly I wouldn't say it's not particularly worrying because I think

397
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:41,840
it is worrying but we're not seeing a serious crisis in the energy markets in a way in which we did

398
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:49,360
pretty much immediately on Russia's invasion of Ukraine and I think that does go back to the fact

399
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:55,280
that the energy situation in the Middle East including Israel's vulnerability on energy

400
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:02,400
security issues is just not what it was in the past then we can add in the fact that the United

401
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:10,560
States as well as being now not insignificant exporter of oil has got the capacity to release more

402
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:16,080
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve 180 million barrels released really in the context of the

403
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:23,920
Russia's invasion of Ukraine none of these things were true in the 1970s indeed the whole

404
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:31,520
Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in response to the crisis of the 1970s instead of

405
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,480
being an exporter the United States was on a trajectory in the 1970s to become in the largest

406
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:44,880
oil importer in the in the world and so I think that the immediate crunch points around the energy

407
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:53,120
situation are nowhere near as difficult as they were in the 70s but just to go back to a question

408
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,880
that I didn't answer and I think this does come into matters though is I do think there's they

409
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:01,920
are still you know very profound resentment in a lot of oil producing countries amongst citizens

410
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:08,240
about what they look what looks to them like foreign extractivism with heavy legacy heavy

411
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:17,200
undertone still of the imperial past I think if you say like why was it not possible for the

412
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:22,720
international oil companies that got those contracts from the Iraqi government the western ones

413
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,440
essentially to stay there and do well and turn Iraq into the kind of large-scale oil producer

414
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,520
that the Bush administration had in mind in partly it is because of the domestic resistance that they

415
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:42,160
ran into in Iraq the political situation now partly that's to do with ISIS but it was also to do

416
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:53,440
with direct attacks on the headquarters of oil companies from angry Iraqi citizens I mean if the

417
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:02,080
experiment was can Western oil companies go back into a Middle Eastern country after the age of

418
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,720
energy nationalism of the 1970s and succeed well the answer turned out to be no they can't

419
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,560
have you been over there have you traveled in Iraq Iran no I've never been to the Middle East no

420
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:19,440
okay um and just as an aside are you teaching right now like this semester what are the what

421
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,120
classes are you teaching what is the title of the class I teach uh first year I part

422
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,720
teacher first year course which is the introduction to politics for the students and the undergraduate

423
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:33,120
program and then I teach a course called the politics of the international economy to the

424
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:40,480
third years wow and how do you enjoy that a lot I really like teaching yeah I miss it

425
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:47,600
I'm kind of teaching with the podcast but it's not the same as sitting in the room with 20 19

426
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:54,080
year olds and having a conversation you know and they're so curious and bright and have their whole

427
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,200
lives ahead of them and it it feels like a privilege and also a responsibility you know

428
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,240
completely yeah yeah yeah um so we're going to get back to the Middle East and I also want to talk

429
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:13,520
to you about Ukraine but you're a historian and could you speak briefly because I also want to

430
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:19,520
talk about the United States can you talk briefly about how energy and oil in particular really

431
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:28,560
set up Britain and later Germany to become key powers in Europe I don't think most people

432
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:36,880
look at that history from an energy perspective yeah I think that if we look at the the 19th

433
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:46,720
century and the real rise to economic preeminence of Britain I mean Britain had obviously established

434
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:56,240
itself as a perhaps the dominant naval power even in the 18th by the middle second third of the the

435
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:03,920
18th century before the industrial revolution but its economic preeminence comes with the

436
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:09,280
industrial revolution and if we say then like well why did Britain industrialize before

437
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:17,200
um any other country in the world I think that the the answer is not only that it had

438
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:24,480
significant or abundant domestic coal but also because they've been using coal actually for

439
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,040
a very long time for heating purposes pretty much again unlike anywhere else going back

440
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:36,400
even the 12th century certainly in the third by the 13th century uh it had

441
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:45,520
incentive to find ways of extracting deeper coal and the steam engine the first point

442
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:51,440
purpose of the steam engine was to do precisely that to be used in mining and then the steam engine

443
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:58,320
ran off coal so you kind of like it's a it's a circular phenomenon if you then look at the way

444
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:04,560
in which British naval power developed in the 19th century and you look at something that I think is

445
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:09,920
pretty significant in in in world history which is the and I say world history very deliberately

446
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:18,880
is the first opium war and the opening up of imperial um china its British steam ships um that

447
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:30,160
now um are able to be much more powerful than any sail based um navy um could be if you then look

448
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:39,440
at the German um story Germany um is advantaged like Britain by having coal a lot of coal um

449
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,880
but unlike Britain uh it actually doesn't have iron deposits that are adjacent to the coal

450
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,280
a quite a lot of the iron deposits are in Alsace-Lorraine France doesn't have coal even just saying

451
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:56,560
that like that explains I think quite a lot as to why between 1870 and the creation of Germany

452
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:02,000
through the Second World War Alsace-Lorraine is a central part of the conflict between

453
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:09,600
like France and Germany explains why the European coal and steel community the first part of

454
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:17,760
the the European project effectively was a means of giving France access to that West German

455
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:24,640
coal if we then bring oil into it the thing that's really hard for every European power except for

456
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:29,360
Austria really in the beginning of the 20th century is they don't have any domestically

457
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,440
if you look at the beginning of the 20th century the two large oil producers of the

458
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,120
United States and Russia I don't think it's a coincidence that they are going to go on

459
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:45,520
albeit in the case of Russia in the form of the Soviet Union to dominate the 20th century geopolitically

460
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:52,240
to take over the European imperial powers by contrast are going to be you know eclipsed Britain

461
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,120
tries to deal with its oil problem which it does sort of moderately successfully by extending its

462
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:07,280
empire around oil i.e sphere of influence in Persia what will be Iraq in the post what was

463
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:15,360
Mesopotamia what will become Iraq in the post First World War world Germany loses desperately

464
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:19,840
in that contest during the in the in the First World War it ends up with nothing in the Middle

465
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:25,600
it tries to take Baku which is the basis of the now Soviet oil industry and fails

466
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:33,120
so Hitler's invasion of Russia has puzzled historians but you suggested it was at least

467
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:38,640
partly about oil did i understand that correctly from from your work yeah i mean i'm not the first

468
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,400
person who who who he's made this argument though people who know a lot more about that about this

469
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:56,640
than than i do but i think that if you understand that Germany was in from its point of view and

470
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,400
this is i'm not talking about Weimar Germany so after the the first war in a really very difficult

471
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:12,880
position because it had lost the war in the Middle East is its bank made well one of its most

472
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:18,080
important banks if not the its most important bank Deutsche Bank which had effectively operated as

473
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:26,800
its international oil company in the pre-1914 world held 25 percent of the shares in the what was

474
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:33,120
then called the Turkish Petroleum Company which had the mandate for the concession rather sorry

475
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:39,920
for drilling in Mesopotamia and as part of the peace then Germany had to hand over or Deutsche

476
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:50,560
Bank had to hand over that ultimately to France so the Germans begin in the Weimar period on a

477
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:56,000
program of creating synthetic fuel which is essentially to create an artificial version of

478
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:04,960
oil from coal Hitler expands yeah Hitler expands that program but there is no way that he can engage

479
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:11,200
the Nazis under Hitler can engage in wall of conquest without much more oil supply than they

480
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:18,560
actually have and by 1941 the second half well by the summer of 1941 it's it's pretty clear

481
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:25,200
that the conquered territories that Germany Nazi Germany has by that point plus synthetic fuel

482
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:33,600
is not sufficient and that Hitler and Hitler was i would say apocalyptically obsessed with energy

483
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:39,120
is is that he thought that there's only way forward for Germany if he was going to stay in

484
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:44,720
the war was to conquer Baku which is in present day Abajajam which was then the center of the

485
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:56,080
Soviet oil industry this is going to sound like a obtuse question but if oil is the master resource

486
00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,200
and what you said Hitler was obsessed with oil and

487
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:10,560
homo sapiens historically have gone to war when there are resource or geographical limits

488
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:15,360
could you imagine fighting a war a kinetic war on renewable energy

489
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:26,000
no not the same way i mean i think that i think that there is a difference between

490
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:37,920
the geopolitical ramifications of the arbitrary distribution either under the earth's surface

491
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:45,600
or under the earth's waters of oil and gas then there is of metals which is what is obviously

492
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:57,120
an issue in low carbon energy leaving the uranium question aside on on on nuclear and

493
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,680
at a certain point i mean people who are

494
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:15,120
engineers uh where we engineers is perhaps not the right word but there are people who know a

495
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:22,080
lot more about metals they just put it that way then than i do and it's not difficult i think

496
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:31,200
there to imagine that at a certain point that it will be possible to recycle the metals that are

497
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:40,320
necessary for the energy transition and that it is also possible that it will be possible to

498
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:49,600
innovate technologically and find ways to do what are presently being done done let's say by like

499
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,760
lithium in relation to batteries in different ways now energies we both know now isn't like that

500
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:03,760
you extract oil or gas and you get to use it once

501
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,480
and i think that that makes a like that is quite a fundamental difference between where we might be

502
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:21,280
going geopolitically with the um now that isn't to say that i'm somebody who is really like gong

503
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:31,920
how optimistic about the energy transition but i'm not at least yet convinced that the the geopolitics

504
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:41,440
of metals has to be quite as dangerous and fraught as the geopolitics of oil and gas and

505
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:50,560
particularly oil were in the 20th century so your summary comments there are that we're going to need

506
01:00:50,560 --> 01:01:00,000
a lot of metals and materials in order to decarbonize but that rematerialization won't have the same

507
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,720
geopolitical constraints of those nations that happen to live where there were ancient oceans

508
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:12,720
and therefore hydrocarbons were buried but let me ask a subset of that which is

509
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:23,120
is the global cooperation and the geopolitics such that with this George Floyd moment in the Middle

510
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:33,760
East and the anti-colonialist kind of simmering up around the world will the global north and west

511
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:42,640
be able to forge agreements in african nations and in southeast asia where a lot of these

512
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:52,800
metals reside is is there still the the political economy that existed 50 years ago to scale that

513
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:00,880
is that a constraint yeah i mean that's the point where i'm much more pessimistic i think it's a

514
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:11,280
particular problem for european countries um both because european countries are significantly

515
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:20,720
more resource poor than the united states they're also largely quite densely populated there's

516
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:29,120
going to be much more resistance to domestic exploration for mining in european countries

517
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,760
and i think that ultimately will be in the united states i'm not saying there won't be but i i just

518
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:39,920
think in europe it's a really made proof to be a really hard constraint on exploring those domestic

519
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:48,560
possibilities and then for the european countries they're going back to try and cultivate private

520
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:57,360
sector investment backed by state support often in parts of the world that they once colonized

521
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:07,760
where people have got long memories about europeans and resource extraction in those countries

522
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:18,480
and i think you can see that in what was happening in west africa just over the course of the summer

523
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,200
niger in particular where france had been getting a quarter of its uranium

524
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:35,680
from there was a coup the language of this is partly bound up i think with a certain kind of

525
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:44,560
resource nationalism and i think that is going to be the the norm for western countries and

526
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:51,920
particularly european ones in trying to cultivate relationships economic relationships in places

527
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:59,920
that are metal rich and it's going to be even harder when actually european well it's not here

528
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,880
it's just actually everybody western countries are saying look we're going to do the energy

529
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,080
transition while we've got to keep our fossil fuel energy system going we're going to use that

530
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:18,080
basically as our insurance policy but you can't do that you've got to jump straight into this energy

531
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,960
future that we don't really trust is quite right coming and we're going to make it a condition

532
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:29,200
of us doing things that might help you with the energy transition and facilitate our investments

533
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:36,960
in your metal supply chains by with conditional demands that you don't build new pipelines so

534
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:46,320
oil pipelines or like gas pipelines or you don't build new coal fired power stations and i just

535
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:51,600
think that that that that's just like politically just not it's not going to work at all and i think

536
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:56,960
that everything that happened last year in terms of russia's invasion of ukraine and the european

537
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:02,800
reaction to that which was when there was a difficulty european countries including britain

538
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:10,160
which was hardly the most exposed where russian gas was concerned went back to keeping coal fired

539
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:15,680
power stations that were due to close open and they did this in the british case like just

540
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:21,520
months after they'd been caught by glasgow lecturing the chinese and the indians and indonesians

541
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:28,800
about how they had to make commitments to phase out coal by 2045 and what they showed was britain

542
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:34,400
and others european countries was in the emergency where electricity was concerned coal was the energy

543
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:40,160
source of like last resort so why should anybody listen so anything european countries have got

544
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:45,920
to say about phasing out coal when they've when when they've seen that and i think you can hear

545
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,800
quite a number of like indian diplomats or indian ministers say things that make pretty clear well

546
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:55,440
your hypocrisy was exposed really very very clearly we're just not we were not really interested in

547
01:05:55,440 --> 01:06:02,960
listening to what you've got to say and right now as we speak india is bursting through all time

548
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:12,000
coal production in that nation and the world for that matter yeah yeah um so let's move to the united

549
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:20,160
states uh i knew that i would be running out of time with you um and we're we're halfway through

550
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:28,000
the the time period that i i promised um because you know there's horizontal and and deep vertical

551
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:36,640
complexity on this entire situation um there's geopolitics uh there's history uh there's energy

552
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:42,000
and then there's there's money which we haven't talked about so a large part of the united states

553
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:48,800
geopolitical strength in the mid 20th century came from dominance in energy markets and then we had

554
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:57,840
the conventional peak of us crude in 1970 followed by uh nixon eliminating the gold standard and from

555
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:05,680
that period on much of the u.s geopolitical power has come from a huge expansion of dollar

556
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:11,920
denominated debt predominantly uh and developing nations in combination with the petrodollar to

557
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:18,320
support the largest military in the world uh is this source of strength from dollar denominated

558
01:07:18,320 --> 01:07:27,440
debt strong enough to hold the geopolitical sway that the u.s is used to even if the dollar were

559
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,400
to become unlinked from the purchase of oil in effect a decline of the the petrodollar

560
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:41,680
i i think this is a really important question night i think if we go back to the the 70s

561
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:49,200
and we say why didn't american power unravel more than it did in the 70s because obviously

562
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:58,720
in significant ways militarily it really did unravel in the in the the 1970s i think the moves

563
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:06,640
towards financial liberalization and the ability to reconstruct a new dollar system after dollar

564
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:12,000
gold convertibility been ended by nixon and after the fixed exchange rate regime had come

565
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:19,840
to an end uh in march 1973 that is absolutely like central to that and if you push that thought

566
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:27,600
a little bit further and said like why didn't the world that was imagined by some in what now

567
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:34,640
gets called the global south uh of commodity exporters becoming more powerful commodity

568
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:41,040
importers falling down the hierarchy so to speak i think a significant part of the answer

569
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:48,000
is because finance became much more uh central to the way in which the the world economy

570
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:55,840
worked and the united states was able as you said to basically have world economy on the

571
01:08:55,840 --> 01:09:02,720
debt side credit side run through dollar debt it was able to pay for

572
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:11,760
its own imports of oil in its own currency which was a luxury that that nobody else had the

573
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:18,320
buddhist had it for a while and got them in a way like through the the 60s but in the 70s they

574
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:24,720
into need well until the north sea oil started but they end up with a dollar buying buying

575
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:34,000
oil in dollar problem indeed just on that i mean the french in the 1980s described the strength

576
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:44,000
of the dollar after the vulgar shock as a third oil price shock so that there's lots of things

577
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:50,320
that privileged the united states still about that world that emerges out the world economy that

578
01:09:50,320 --> 01:10:00,080
merges out of the um the 1970s now i think there's an absolutely no doubt whatsoever that that some

579
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:06,480
of the large oil imports is obviously starting with china would like nothing more than to be able

580
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:14,000
to be done with the dollar when it comes to buying oil imports and gas imports for that

581
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,760
matter um too i mean china has enough problems it's generated by its foreign and oil gas dependency

582
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:27,600
without having to deal with the need to pay for this uh in dollars on on on on top of um or else

583
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:34,000
but i think it's not so clear yet that that's really a very attractive proposition to the

584
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:40,560
sellers and certainly where Saudi Arabia um is um concerned because Saudi Arabia became

585
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:47,200
deeply integrated itself into that dollar world the post 19 the post gold dollar world let's call

586
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:55,200
it that that emerged in the in in the 70s it's willingness to buy um american um debt and i

587
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:02,320
think then what has happened since 2008 really actually since 2007 since the first bit of the

588
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:08,960
financial crash in august of 2007 is in terms of dollar credit um the position of the united

589
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:12,960
states and the federal reserve in particular they've become significantly more important

590
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:19,280
since then than they even than they were um before and that china is much more vulnerable

591
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:26,560
to the fed's monetary decision making to crises of confidence in the euro dollar system than it

592
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:34,640
was pre um 2008 because it was less involved in it so is is that i think now that the the euro

593
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:42,000
dollar system and and and dollar um dollar debt is actually probably more important than ever

594
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:48,960
in some respects at least and whatever the incentives to get out of the system which are

595
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:55,520
overwhelming from the point of view of of china the actual ability to do so is the actual capacity

596
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:02,720
to do that is is much harder than it would seem i think so there might be a desire to get off of

597
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,280
the dollar as the world's reserve currency um and the way that countries have to buy oil but the

598
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:14,000
mechanics of doing that i mean the dollar has lots of problems but it's better than all the

599
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,960
alternatives let me ask you this yeah no no go on well i this is kind of a meta question but

600
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:28,320
what really underpins the strength and ubiquity and confidence in the u.s dollar

601
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:34,160
is it the productivity and the size of the economy or that we're 90 plus percent energy

602
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:40,160
independent or is it really the military and if it's the military we're printing more dollars and

603
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:46,480
going further into debt a trillion dollars every couple months to pay for the military and everything

604
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:53,600
else there's this like uh unraveling there of of of how it was all put together what do you think

605
01:12:53,600 --> 01:13:02,000
about that i mean i i i think that this is a is is a quite hard question to unpack all the different

606
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,720
ways in which dollar strength works but my instinct is that actually it's the way the

607
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:16,000
international banking system works that's actually the most important thing now about

608
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:25,520
the dollar's position um and i think you can see that in the ways in which the united states

609
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:32,960
has under the last few presidents pretty much like all of them being able to use other countries

610
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:40,480
companies access to the american banking system to basically make various bits of foreign policy

611
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:47,360
work so if you say like why would they be able to bring the europeans in line on the sanctions

612
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:56,880
against iran both in terms of obama's initial policy of getting around to the negotiating table

613
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:04,800
and then in terms of after trump ended the iran nuclear agreement it's because it's just too

614
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:13,120
difficult for anyone's companies to be shut out of the american banking system now again

615
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:24,560
the willingness to use that weapon incentivizes resistance to it because who wants to be constrained

616
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:31,600
by american foreign policy if they can not be but actually finding ways out i mean the european

617
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:40,320
as i understand it anyway the european countries tried quite hard to find ways of still being able to

618
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,880
make financial transactions with iran after 2018 and found it really pretty much impossible to do so

619
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:56,720
so let's move to russia and the ukraine since we're doing a whirlwind tour of international

620
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:04,080
political economy so russia's invasion in ukraine despite the tragedy there nicely timed for your

621
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:11,360
book release had profound energy price and security implications for europe as well as other parts of

622
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:19,680
the world so putin my colleague art burman said on a podcast has a a degree in economics focused on

623
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:25,440
energy and there are some people believe it was this ghost written or plagiarized but still he

624
01:15:25,440 --> 01:15:32,000
seems to know a lot more about energy than most of his western counterparts so how much of this

625
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:40,320
ukraine invasion in february of 2022 was about energy versus just a territorial play and how

626
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:48,480
did his earlier campaign and Crimea fit into this strategy i think that you can't begin to understand

627
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:55,040
relations between russia and post independence ukraine so going back to december of 1991

628
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:03,600
without making energy quite central to that and a significant part of that is obviously the pipelines

629
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:11,600
that ran through ukraine or run through ukraine i should say both oil and gas right so from the

630
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:18,720
point of view of russia the disillusion of the soviet union and the independence of ukraine was

631
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:26,400
a complete strategic disaster where energy was concerned because at that point in the 90s all its

632
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:34,800
oil and gas markets go westwards and the pipelines now go through an independent

633
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:43,760
state with which it's got historically extremely complicated and so then i think you can say is

634
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:53,520
is that putin from relatively early from when he came into power kind of worked quite systematically

635
01:16:53,520 --> 01:17:01,200
to try to change that on terms of european markets and that was really not just what the

636
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:07,040
Nord Stream pipelines under the Baltic Sea were about but his moves to build more pipelines under

637
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:14,480
the black sea and he wanted to be able to weaken ukraine by shutting it out of russia's transit

638
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:22,400
system and indeed from his point of view eliminate the risk that ukraine posed to the reliability

639
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:29,440
of russia as an energy exporter i think if you then go to the Crimea crisis you can see that he

640
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:36,560
even with Yanukovych he was supposedly russia friendly in office is Yanukovych had been making

641
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:42,320
deals with various of the western oil companies including for exploration under the for the exploration

642
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:49,440
under the the black sea and by taking control of Crimea and proving russia's position in the black

643
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:57,520
sea the direct control of savastopol there was a certain energy logic to that too i think if you

644
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:06,400
then go though to the events of february of 2022 and say is energy an explanation of this move this is

645
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:11,520
where i think it's a lot harder to say that there was an energy motive that doesn't mean to say that

646
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:21,440
there aren't resource energy resources that issue particularly in the in the Donbas and that that

647
01:18:21,440 --> 01:18:26,640
was the area or part of the area anyway where there were some prospects of ukrainian shale

648
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:33,840
though i should say you shale gas that is that by the time that even by the time that the Crimea

649
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,440
had happened the annexation of Crimea had happened it was already clear that the shale in poland which

650
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:46,240
had been particularly hyped up as possibly the equivalent to the united states turned out not

651
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:52,480
to be like that the rocks didn't fracture like in the same way so it may be that ukrainian shale

652
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:59,440
was always a dead end but he kind of brought that to an end by the moves in 2014 but i struggled to

653
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:06,400
see really an energy motive for what happened last year i think that's much more about a

654
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:14,560
basic rejection of ukraine as an independent nation state and some concern about the growth

655
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:22,320
of nato power around the black sea do you think putin imagined or predicted or believed that he

656
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:28,960
would lose europe as a gas market when he invaded ukraine i think this is hard i think you can see

657
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:37,360
that he tried to put some pressure on the european governments in the latter months of 2021 so there

658
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:43,360
was some reduced supply through various of the pipelines going on often sort of presented as

659
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,960
being for technical reasons but i think it's probably better seen as kind of like warnings

660
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:58,080
that i could i could do a lot inflict a lot more harm on you um than um this

661
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:09,200
i think that the thing where you can say that he may have misread the signals quite a bit

662
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:16,400
is actually on Nord Stream 2 encouraged really by the biden administration which would

663
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:25,600
move the sanctions on Nord Stream 2 about six i think it was it was at a may or june of 2021

664
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:31,680
so from that point of view i mean the germans who've basically been fighting a rearguard

665
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:37,520
action trying to defend Nord Stream 2 ever since the annexation of crime area sorry the year after

666
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:45,200
so 2015 when they made the agreement to build Nord Stream 2 must have looked like well we've

667
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:50,800
held on despite all that american pressure we've been vindicated we've got our pipeline we won't

668
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:58,560
be dependent on that unreliable supply coming through ukraine for very much longer and i could

669
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:06,720
see that putin could have thought the germans aren't going to give up on this just at the point when

670
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:13,440
they've got what they've been secured what they've invested spent a lot of political credibility

671
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:20,640
um on but i think he just misjudged really quite profoundly how difficult it would be

672
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:26,720
for a german government to legitimate the energy relationship with russia in the context of all

673
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:33,200
our war against ukraine i just think that that was such a shock in germany that for germany to then

674
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:37,360
carry on with the status quo now in lots of ways i think they carried on with the status quo more

675
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:44,080
than it seems but they had rhetorically to impudiate that relationship and i think perhaps he didn't

676
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:52,560
really understand that how did europe become so dependent on russian oil and natural gas and given

677
01:21:52,640 --> 01:22:01,760
your knowledge of history and the world wars in the 20th century based on oil

678
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:10,720
and coal underpinning the first industrial economies led by the uk and and and germany

679
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:18,000
is this going to be the beginning of a phase of deindustrialization because of what's happening

680
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:24,160
in europe i mean i i think the answer from um germany's point of view which i think is the

681
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:32,080
the crucial european country where this russian energy relationship is um concern that in the age

682
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:38,800
of oil that russia whether it was russia or whether it was the soviet union whether it's back to

683
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:43,760
russia again is the most obvious

684
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:54,800
oil relationship for germany to have if you think of it as there being three big blocks the americas

685
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:07,920
the middle east and russia just geography alone would align germany in russia's direction

686
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:14,480
and then if you think about it um historically the periods of aberration

687
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:23,360
until what's happened in the last year were the period when hitler went from the nazi

688
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:34,880
soviet pact to outright conquest and then the period between well the first 15 years or so of

689
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:44,240
the cold war when west germany wasn't buying oil from the soviet union so in one sense you could

690
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:50,000
put the question the other way around is like let's explain why those ones were the way that they

691
01:23:51,200 --> 01:24:00,000
were if you look at it then in terms of post war history so why did that period of the

692
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:06,080
early cold war come to an end the beginning of the answer for west germany is the serious crisis

693
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:14,880
because aden hara the conrad aden hara the west german chancellor at the time he was utterly

694
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:20,400
appalled by what eisen hara did he went off to paris to see the french prime minister guy

695
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:27,440
moley he was there i believe when eden rang moley to tell him that they were going to have to

696
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:32,480
pull out and aden hara said europe will be your revenge

697
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:42,480
meaning the creation of the european economic community but in practical terms is they began

698
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:47,920
which had already been started by italian oil company further discussions with the soviet

699
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:54,160
regime about buying oil from the the the soviet union now the americans put sufficient pressure

700
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:59,600
on west germany to make that really difficult again use of extraterritorial pressure of

701
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:08,560
extraterritorial sanctions so actually west germany was quite late of the european countries

702
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,960
or put it this way it wasn't the first of the european countries to either get soviet oil

703
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:19,360
or later to make gas agreements but once the taboo in cold war terms are being lifted which

704
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:24,560
it really was by the johnson administration in the united states then i think west germany went

705
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:31,840
back to what is the more geographically obvious thing for it to do which is to have a energy

706
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:38,720
relationship with what was then the the soviet union the the big problem for germany in the

707
01:25:38,720 --> 01:25:43,440
post cold war world was really this ukrain issue in this sense germany and russia were in the same

708
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:51,360
place about this because they the germans didn't want to be dependent for their energy supply on a

709
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:59,520
ukrainian economically christian ridden country for a lot of the time in the post independence period

710
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:07,200
where at times of difficulty there was siphoning off of the gas coming through the pipelines

711
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:13,520
in terms of the conflicts about pricing between russia and ukraine and and that germany would take

712
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:20,320
an energy security hit for the nature of the russia ukraine relationship far better logically

713
01:26:20,320 --> 01:26:24,880
from its point of view to have a pipeline that went under the Baltic sea or two pipelines that

714
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:30,000
went under the Baltic sea and bypassed russia so bypass ukraine and allowed for direct russia

715
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,400
relationship but but now that's ancient history so now they're dependent on middle eastern

716
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:42,080
lng and stuff from all over the world but now the middle east is in crisis too so that adds

717
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:51,040
further risk to future energy imports for for europe now completely i mean you you can see that this

718
01:26:52,880 --> 01:27:00,960
this nightmare in terms of like which poison do you pick here continues to you have three european

719
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:07,200
countries in the space of the last three months that have signed long term 20 year plus 27 year

720
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:14,800
plus i think in each case lng agreements with katar the dutch the italians and the french

721
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:24,240
and katar as we know is the at least as important sponsor in a way of of hamas as iran

722
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:34,640
is and that would be if there is a if there's an equivalent of the arab oil embargo on the

723
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:44,960
us and the netherlands back in 19 october 73 to march 74 it would be katar embargoing the sale of

724
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:51,760
liquid natural gas to european countries including britain with who've with with which it's had

725
01:27:52,640 --> 01:27:56,080
long-term contracts for quite a while if that were to happen i mean that would be

726
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:02,720
a cataclysmic event for the world economy and for europe yeah and this goes back to the question

727
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:06,320
that we came up that you asked and i don't think i answered about the prospects for

728
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,240
deindustrialization essentially in germany and i think that that is real i mean maybe

729
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:21,520
deindustrialization is you know too hyperbolic but we can see that the german industrial economy

730
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:30,160
benefited very much from cheap relatively cheap pipeline gas from russia take that away

731
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:37,600
germany has to import significantly more expensive liquid natural gas from a starting

732
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:42,480
place in which it had no liquid natural gas ports let alone any literally long-term liquid

733
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:49,040
natural gas contracts it had to be bought in the in the spot market you can see all kinds of

734
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:53,680
industrial production that was heavily gas dependent closed down during the course of

735
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,720
last winter that's one of the reasons why european countries got through last winter

736
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:04,720
without more problems where gas supply is concerned because there was you know demand

737
01:29:04,720 --> 01:29:13,840
destruction in the industrial sector particularly in germany if you then were to have katar being

738
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:19,200
willing to use a gas weapon against european countries after they've already taken it from

739
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:24,240
russia because we should remember it wasn't european countries that stopped buying pipeline gas

740
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:35,200
from Nord Stream 1 it was russia that effectively embargoed the sale of that gas is katar politically

741
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:44,000
and diplomatically friendly with iran i mean i think that that's that's not an entirely

742
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:51,920
straightforward relationship either what is true is is that unlike the arab other arab states

743
01:29:52,640 --> 01:30:00,080
they have shared gas interests with iran though those two countries have massive amounts of natural

744
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:07,200
gas yeah i mean it's because they're basically it's like one big gas field with a katar side and a

745
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:14,400
iranian side to it so where where does the uk your country stand in all this your well past peak

746
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:20,800
in your domestic energy production but like the usa you're also a financial and a military hub

747
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:30,000
so is the multipolar world the united states the uk and then a few satellites that that need our

748
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:35,440
military and energy support or where does the uk stand in all of this well i think one of the

749
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:42,240
things that's really interesting if you look at long history uh and look for the patterns like

750
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:50,560
over time um is britain withdrew from east of syria so it ended as i said earlier

751
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:58,960
it's imperial presence um a military presence in the middle east um in 1971 announced that in january

752
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:07,440
of 1968 it did the buddhist navy did have some presence around the persian gulf by the end of

753
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:14,320
the decade but nothing like the scale of the americans um then we have the period from late

754
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:22,480
70s through the 80s into the into the 90s uh of um domestic oil production being quite high

755
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:32,080
via the uh north sea and then since i think it's 2004 um buddhants basically become a net energy

756
01:31:32,080 --> 01:31:37,120
importer again so we're quite some time now we're nearly two decades into britain being back to

757
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:45,200
being a net energy importer and what you can see in the 2010s under the david camberans

758
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:52,000
government is that a reorientation back to the middle east you might even say that britain

759
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:58,800
has come back east of syria again 2015 announced there'd be a new naval base in like borrain

760
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:07,360
clearly um cultivating um relations with the united arab emirates which is an important

761
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:13,840
investor uh in the uk and i think that the finance is i think it was actually another agreement

762
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:20,000
with the united arab emirates just like a couple of weeks ago a new investment um agreement sort

763
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:26,400
of tied to energy transition too but the gulf that the britain is going back to where it's been

764
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:30,720
because it's gone back into the middle east because it's still got that historical relationship

765
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:37,840
particularly with those with those smaller um gulf states because it's become much more dependent

766
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:44,400
back on that part of the world post north sea oil so when i talk to you helen it's like a positive

767
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:51,360
feedback dynamic that i don't have fewer questions i have more questions um let me ask you a couple

768
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:59,600
really hard questions about the middle east so if israel pursues the brass ring moment of

769
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:06,080
evicting palestinian populations from gaza and the west bank possibly

770
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:13,200
is it possible that arab governments collectively will have to respond to that and what would be

771
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:20,800
the implications i think that arab governments would have to like respond to that um but i think

772
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:31,120
that that very fact and the fact that the israelis need to find a way of dealing with or they have

773
01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,320
to have some kind of plan for what happens in gaza once the military action is over i mean that they

774
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:45,360
can't alienate arab states like that and cause them that kind of um difficulty i mean i think in

775
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:53,920
this respect we really need to like understand just like what a colossal problem is well now

776
01:33:53,920 --> 01:34:02,000
faces after what has happened because the status quo any version of the status quo of the the

777
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:07,680
previous day before the 7th of um october is completely gone i mean they're basically under

778
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:22,160
netanaryu treated hamas as uh a quasi partner even though it goes far as saying for isolating the

779
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:29,840
gaza problem from israel and then relying on the technology of the wall and the iron dome to deal

780
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:40,240
with any potential security threat from hamas so let hamas rule um gaza let it be the case that

781
01:34:40,240 --> 01:34:46,160
because they're hamas you can't engage with a question about a palestinian state we defend

782
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:51,120
ourselves with technology and it's all come crashing like down around them but when all said

783
01:34:51,120 --> 01:34:57,920
and done whenever they do militarily somebody's going to have to take responsibility for gaza

784
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:02,480
for them because i cannot believe that they're going to go back in there either and expel the

785
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:07,520
entire population because the united states won't let them do that um or thing that they can rule it

786
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:13,040
directly themselves they need arab help in order to do that some by some means or another

787
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:21,280
okay this is a crazy question to ask uh and i know you're not a religious scholar um a political

788
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:28,320
scholar but how much do end time prophecies around various religious groups play into

789
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:36,000
this situation specifically israel's claim to rebuild the third temple and muslim and evangelical

790
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:42,720
christians and mormons saying that such event would trigger the return of christ i've heard this

791
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:49,360
all pined in the recent week i mean i actually am interest very interested in religious questions

792
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:56,320
but i mean i i don't even know really begin to begin to know how to answer that um question i mean

793
01:35:56,320 --> 01:36:04,960
all i would say is this is that i think that one of the conceptual failures let's call it that um

794
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:11,360
of the way in which the israeli government under net and r u dealt with hamas was an inability to see

795
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:21,840
its millenarian fundamentally millenarian tendencies uh and that millenarian what is that

796
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:30,960
meaning like the the end times okay yeah justify any kind of like destruction in order to bring

797
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:38,480
like the new world right um about and i i i think that they didn't understand that aspect

798
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,880
they turned a blind eye to that aspect of hamas

799
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:51,280
so how how are let's let's bring it down to a a fine point here with everything going on

800
01:36:52,240 --> 01:37:02,240
china russia the us debts hamas israel energy depletion we haven't talked much about climate

801
01:37:02,240 --> 01:37:08,800
change um but as geopolitical tension increases across these different power nodes globally

802
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:18,080
i think energy insecurity for a number of nations will increasingly uh be um politically very

803
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:25,360
important do you think that this is going to push nations towards green energy aspirations

804
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:33,120
or uh in contrast to our resurgence of coal use or maybe we're going to have to learn to cope with

805
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:40,160
a lower energy lifestyle which we've seen some previews with uh last year in in europe uh what

806
01:37:40,160 --> 01:37:47,120
do you what do you think about all that i think that there's no doubt you can see this clearly

807
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:57,120
in europe that energy insecurity driven by geopolitics increased the desire to speed up

808
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:02,080
the energy transition but nothing that happened in europe last year in that respect changed the

809
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:07,840
difficulties facing the energy transition indeed you could argue and i would argue that they increased

810
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:13,200
the difficulties because they made the monetary and financial environment in which it has to happen

811
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:20,480
harder than was previously the case because they intensified what were already the growing pressures

812
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:26,880
on energy um inflation so

813
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:37,920
you can try and speed things up but desires say isn't going isn't going to do that i find it hard to see

814
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:46,080
a world over the next five years let's say certainly five to ten years where there isn't

815
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:53,440
going to be a politics of reduced energy consumption i think the politicians in western countries will

816
01:38:53,440 --> 01:39:03,680
try very very hard to avoid that they will keep looking for fixes that aren't really there to deal

817
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:11,920
with these problems to you know kick the can down the road some more but um

818
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:21,920
there are just a whole set and i think we would agree about this of systemic energy

819
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:29,520
difficulties across the different energy sources they interact with each other in

820
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:37,360
quite dysfunctional um ways and there is of some kind going to be some kind of reckoning with that

821
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:47,440
i don't know i i i know enough to understand that making predictions about when those dynamics are

822
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:53,680
going to play themselves out all the form in which they're going to take it is is is very very difficult

823
01:39:53,840 --> 01:40:01,040
um because there are so many contingencies particularly actually on the on the on the

824
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:10,640
geopolitical side that can derail what seem to be passive development at any any any one time

825
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:13,840
and it's a it's a strange and this is why i think it's hard to think about because on the one hand

826
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:18,720
it's it is systemic but on the other hand it is vulnerable to contingent events

827
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:26,480
well it's been forestalled by debt writ large um around the world um i i want to be respectful

828
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:34,160
of of your evening um well let me ask you a few more questions um you're an energy scholar and a

829
01:40:34,160 --> 01:40:42,960
historian uh given everything you just outlined for me what would be a couple of uh unofficial

830
01:40:43,200 --> 01:40:49,280
unofficial pieces of advice you would have to the leaders on Downing Street or in in your

831
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:59,760
country ahead of um probably um reduced energy use you said earlier the political uh um football

832
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:05,680
of energy and using less in the uk is probably in not too distant future do you have any thoughts

833
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:13,840
of recommendations i mean the the thing that frustrates me um in terms of what i see in in

834
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:21,600
britain and i wouldn't go any further than that in this respect is that i don't see much evidence the

835
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:32,720
politicians think about energy across the board yeah i think they have bits of energy policy

836
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:40,240
here and there some of it perhaps better thought out than others but i don't think

837
01:41:40,240 --> 01:41:48,400
that they see the ways in which all these different problems interact with each other

838
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:53,360
and all the way in which that they interact with the monetary environment in a way i think they've

839
01:41:53,360 --> 01:42:01,600
got better understanding the geopolitics perhaps in the last year to some extent um anyway i think

840
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:09,680
that is it possible that they could could they be educated uh or is this systemic story that

841
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:14,640
you and i are painting almost like impossible for an elected official to integrate

842
01:42:18,400 --> 01:42:22,240
i think this is a really interesting question because i think in the past the politicians

843
01:42:22,240 --> 01:42:31,120
have actually understood this quite well in western countries so i think that energy blindness to

844
01:42:31,120 --> 01:42:41,440
use your language now has got a history to it it's not just a like static conceptual failure

845
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:49,520
it's things happen at some point in let's say we're gonna this you know 80s 90s whenever

846
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:59,760
it whenever uh it is some i think um understanding that was sort of passed generationally down at

847
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:04,800
least top-level politicians and officials that say in civil servants like in britain

848
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:13,440
somewhere got lost that is my i don't have a uh i really worked out history of that but

849
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:20,640
i have a strong sense that that general picture that i just said there um is um true so in principle

850
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:28,160
i can't see any reason why today's politicians today's officials can't understand the kind of

851
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:33,360
things in which we've been talking about indeed quite the contrary i mean i'd just say look at

852
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:40,000
myself you know 10 10 years ago when i started things so you know this is literally 10 2013

853
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,760
i couldn't be gone so i've had this conversation that we've been having now for like the best part

854
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:52,400
like of two hours most of this is like self education over a decade because i understood

855
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:58,080
enough back in 2013 to think i really really should try to understand this because i think it's

856
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:05,760
going to shape the world in which we all live for some time to come now i see no reason that i

857
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,720
can educate myself to do that i take it from your story you've done that at some point too

858
01:44:10,720 --> 01:44:16,400
that other people who in positions of power can't do this as well well the differences they are playing

859
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:22,800
whack-a-mole every day and they have 15 minute uh time spans let me ask you this so you're an

860
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:29,840
energy scholar uh and a teacher i was a professor but only a teacher really how much time do you

861
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:38,080
spend uh helen every week reading uh or listening to podcasts or educating yourself on on the world

862
01:44:38,080 --> 01:44:46,960
or the world's history i mean i try to yeah i i try to spend quite a reasonable amount of time

863
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:57,200
each um week uh i'm also like uh very busy uh as an academic uh i teach quite a lot i enjoy

864
01:44:57,200 --> 01:45:04,080
teaching um quite a lot so some weeks that i do better than others and sometimes like a few months

865
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:08,560
will go by and then i'll see something and think god i should have understood that like at least

866
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:15,360
six weeks ago and i've missed something like quite significant and and then you here dive into it to

867
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:22,320
and then i dive into it and try it yeah and then so i i'm i learn a lot on the run to be honest i mean

868
01:45:23,840 --> 01:45:31,200
that's part of the nature of the world in which we live me too so so like me you are an analyst

869
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:37,840
that sees all this unfolding but we're kind of observing it like we're watching a movie and we're

870
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:46,960
explaining it but we're also living it helen um so how do you personally cope with learning about

871
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:56,160
the energy geopolitical financial crisis that we're facing and then living and this is your life

872
01:45:56,160 --> 01:46:01,520
and our life that that we're a part of that how do you compartmentalize or how do you manage that

873
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:10,800
that's a good question i um there are times and to be honest it's usually like at night

874
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:23,280
when i just think this is this is a world of like such such danger uh it's quite terrifying

875
01:46:24,240 --> 01:46:31,600
um my day mind is generally a lot better at coping and that was because you're surrounded by bright

876
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:39,280
smiling curious young humans and uh nice buildings and lots of books and food and such night mind

877
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:48,080
yeah but i i mean i'm a quite a fan of lord of the rings me too and um i say to myself and i say

878
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:53,360
i say this to my niece sometimes that i like that bit when gandalf's trying to explain to

879
01:46:55,200 --> 01:47:02,480
frodo why when frodo says i wish it hadn't happened in my time and gandalf says basically so do i so

880
01:47:02,480 --> 01:47:09,680
does everyone who gets to live in such a time but we don't get to choose when we um live we just

881
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:14,960
get to choose what to do with our time we just get to choose what to do with our time and i think

882
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:22,960
that is probably kind of the way that i do try and live in um this respect and i find for myself

883
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:30,480
i'm not saying this would be true for everybody that i find that trying to live open-eyed and trying

884
01:47:30,480 --> 01:47:40,800
to cultivate inner resilience that that is better for me than living with denial well i think that

885
01:47:40,800 --> 01:47:47,760
is true for many of us and many of the people listening to this podcast um and building on that

886
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:54,960
do you have recommendations for those listening who agree with your overview and synthesis uh

887
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:03,040
and kind of foresight of how things might if you squint uh your your picture will hold together in

888
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:12,640
coming decades do you have advice uh for listeners i mean i'm always very uh cautious about um

889
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:20,240
advice i mean because i just kind of think um it's hard enough for me to like get to

890
01:48:20,240 --> 01:48:32,960
grit with advice in myself um i mean i think that you know the the the qualities that um are needed

891
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:39,200
for the times in which we live well the the quality perhaps is resilience and then we have to cultivate

892
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:46,720
that in our cells and sometimes that is going to mean changing um that i think particularly like

893
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:52,480
in western countries those of us who've been incredibly privileged in so many um

894
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:56,720
ways certainly those of us who live absolute lives in western countries because obviously there are

895
01:48:56,720 --> 01:49:04,480
people um who don't the more that we can understand i think the the economic and the geopolitical

896
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:13,680
contingency of the material lives that we have then the easier it is psychologically to to deal with

897
01:49:14,080 --> 01:49:22,320
um to deal with what is coming and that i think it though when it goes back you know

898
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:27,920
i think it does matter how we choose to how we choose to live in these times i don't think

899
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:34,560
there's any reason to say that because it's hard and there's so many um difficulties and

900
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:38,720
dangers ahead that that doesn't mean that we can't live our lives well

901
01:49:39,280 --> 01:49:45,440
and you're a teacher and i don't know how much uh in those two classes you're currently teaching

902
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:52,560
you get to the depth of what the conversation we just had um but clearly your students are aware

903
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:58,720
of what's going on in the middle east and russia um and ukraine so what do you what advice do you

904
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:04,400
give your students um at the end of the semester and and what advice would you give to young humans

905
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:13,440
listening to this episode i mean i don't tend to like advise um the students i have in the way

906
01:50:13,440 --> 01:50:19,920
that the Cambridge system like works i have about 25 students who i have a very direct

907
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:29,200
responsibility for like beyond um teaching um very interested in their lives and i try to engage

908
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:36,560
with them about that i have a strong sense that it really matters what is passed from like one

909
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:45,440
generation to the next i'm very conscious of what my inheritances have been in that um respect

910
01:50:46,400 --> 01:50:51,440
and i'm interested i suppose as much in trying to give something back to them in the way in which

911
01:50:51,440 --> 01:51:00,560
i think something was like given to me and that they then might like pass on um to i mean i do

912
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:13,760
think i probably encourage them to to try to historicize the moment and to try to uh understand

913
01:51:13,760 --> 01:51:22,160
that um human beings have they've lived through some much harder times than even the ones that we

914
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:29,040
get far harder and that they've survived and that the human spirit has like survived through

915
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:32,480
that i mean i think about europe through the the black death

916
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:46,640
century and that there are all kinds of good things in the future we may well not live to see

917
01:51:46,640 --> 01:51:54,400
in this um respect but it's never if you look at human history just a story of permanent disaster

918
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:58,720
from which that there is no escape and i'm not saying that because i want to minimize any of

919
01:51:58,720 --> 01:52:07,440
the catastrophes in the first part of the 20th century which quite quite um the contrary um

920
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:12,000
but we don't have to well our own lives are concerned i don't think we don't have to be fatalistic

921
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:22,640
yep i agree let me ask you this it's my belief um that there's around 240 million college students

922
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:30,000
in the world and i think humans in grad school particularly and postdocs are an incredible

923
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:40,080
and underutilized natural resource um that we can have help tackling the systemic overview that

924
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:47,280
that you and i have discussed um but within the current academy which is kind of part of the energy

925
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:54,240
hungry superorganism and linear and business as usual i don't think the creativity is being

926
01:52:54,240 --> 01:53:03,440
directed towards its best use so in your field um political economy political science uh energy

927
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:11,840
with an energy lens can you offer a few big questions that uh postdocs uh and such around

928
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:18,880
the world listening to this program could be working on that need uh research and answers but

929
01:53:18,880 --> 01:53:25,360
might not be what's conventionally chosen i mean i think there's one here i really would

930
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:33,600
pick and uh for political economy and that is the relationship between monetary history and energy

931
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:45,120
history okay i mean i spent some time in um in disorder trying to think about that in relationship

932
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:52,080
to the end of dollar gold convertibility and in relation to the 2008 crash but the nature of

933
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:58,400
the book meant that i was just scratching like at the surface i actually had an idea of trying

934
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:05,120
to do something more systematically about uh this myself including trying to think about the

935
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:12,960
relationship between the the 1929 crash the end of the the gold standard the interwar gold standard

936
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:18,960
and changes in the energy world particularly the um return of the soviet union as a as an oil

937
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:28,160
export and i think there's there may be something um in that but i think that that gets as well at

938
01:54:28,160 --> 01:54:34,800
a question that i think that is really important beyond political economy and in some ways it goes

939
01:54:34,800 --> 01:54:41,760
to the heart of like the way in which economics is done academically which is this presumption

940
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:50,320
that actually we understand the economic world via a monetary lens rather than via an energy lens

941
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:56,000
and i think that once you bring the energy lens into political economy a lot of things start to look

942
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:05,760
quite different and so i think um a project which looked at the relationship between monetary

943
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:09,440
history and energy history through the entirety of the 20th century and maybe even going back to the

944
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:18,240
origins of the of the gold standard in the in the in the 1870s would be very would be very revealing

945
01:55:18,240 --> 01:55:27,200
and would have some significance beyond just the actual history in terms of trying to bring a more

946
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:32,960
well trying to you know move the dial away from a monetary focus to an energy focus and understanding

947
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:41,840
the economic world okay thank you a couple closing questions helen what do you care most about in the

948
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:51,760
world uh that's that is um that is a non-academic question yeah because it presumes a quite high

949
01:55:51,760 --> 01:56:03,440
level of self-awareness that one really knows what one does um care um about uh i mean in a

950
01:56:03,440 --> 01:56:11,600
personal sense i i'm i'm passionate about the pursuit of knowledge that's i'm very intellectually

951
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:24,320
curious that drives quite a lot of um of what i do um i'm also um very interested in

952
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:34,160
cultural and spiritual questions i don't think of this uh in terms of being focused on political

953
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:41,280
economy i don't think of that as being at odds with a more spiritual way of thinking about

954
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:47,120
the world i'd rather try and think both materially and um spiritually i mean beyond myself i'd go

955
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:52,400
back in a way to the answer that i gave you know like earlier i mean i care very deeply about what

956
01:56:52,400 --> 01:57:00,560
is passed between the generations i feel very that inwardly quite strongly uh in terms of my own

957
01:57:01,120 --> 01:57:07,440
personal history but in tools also the fact that you know i've been working in a university as a

958
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:18,240
educator for nearly three decades um now and that i find that it's very uh well it's just

959
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:21,840
rewarding to i was going to say emotionally but that's not actually sufficient it's rewarding to

960
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:28,080
me as a human being to do that and it's very important to me that i continue to do that

961
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:35,680
i fully agree uh i feel the same way and that is uh why i continue to do this podcast because

962
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:45,280
i think education is the single no regret strategy given what we face um to to uh pass the baton to

963
01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:51,360
the next generation as you say um if you uh and you i know you listen to my podcast so you know

964
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:57,040
what question i'm i'm about to ask if you had a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to

965
01:57:57,040 --> 01:58:02,960
your decision what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures

966
01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:13,520
i mean i thought about this quite hard and in one sense the easy answer i think given we're

967
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:21,280
talking about energy would be to say the success of fusion so something that would that that would

968
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:27,120
basically mean the human beings didn't have to think about energy in the same way that they could

969
01:58:27,120 --> 01:58:32,560
take it like for for granted but they want to start to think about that i thought well actually

970
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:39,280
nobody's got any idea what it would mean to be a human being under conditions in which

971
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:49,920
energy could just be like taken for granted maybe that just because for a couple of centuries

972
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:57,280
certainly that energy is being fossil fuel energy drove such conflict between states that if we had

973
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,280
an abundant energy didn't have to think about it maybe we would just do other find other ways of

974
01:59:01,280 --> 01:59:08,000
doing bad things because we wouldn't be constrained by energy so i kind of a little bit more would go

975
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:15,840
with the uh making us all changing or having higher levels of self-awareness a consciousness thing

976
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:25,120
rather than the materials first thing uh more aware of our own um shared humanity more aware

977
01:59:25,120 --> 01:59:34,320
less selfish um consciousness more aware of our relationship to the uh to to the to the planet

978
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:44,720
and i don't think obviously that's a fix in um any sense whatsoever um but i think that the

979
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:52,000
world would be would be a better place that's a good wish

980
01:59:52,880 --> 02:00:00,640
um to be continued my friend thank you for your scholarship and your teaching and we'll be in touch
