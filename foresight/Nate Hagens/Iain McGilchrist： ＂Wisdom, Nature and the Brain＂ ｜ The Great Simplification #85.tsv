0	8160	I would like to warmly welcome my next guest, Ian McGilchrist. Ian is a psychiatrist,
8880	16000	a neuroscience researcher, an author, a philosopher, a literary scholar. He is an
16000	22000	associate, a fellow of the Green Templeton College, Oxford, a fellow of the Royal College
22000	28400	of Psychiatrists, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a consultant emeritus of the Bethlehem
28400	35760	and Maudsley Hospital in London. Professor McGilchrist came into prominence with the publication of
35760	42960	his tome, The Master and His Emissary, The Divided Brain, and The Making of the Western World,
44160	50320	which is how I came to be exposed to his work. And then 14 years later, his most recent book
50320	56880	titled The Matter with Things, Our Brains, Our Delusions, and The Unmaking of the World.
57840	66320	This was one of those conversations that was both profound, wise, and intimate. I had never
66320	72880	met or spoken with Ian before the camera was turned on, and I learned continually during this
72880	80960	podcast, and I immediately felt a kinship with this man who deeply cares about the state of the
80960	88400	world and has spent a lifetime researching what I think is the most important aspect of our situation,
88400	95680	which is the human brain and our disconnect from the types of experience and perspectives of our
95680	102880	ancestors. I hope you enjoy this episode as much as I did. Please welcome Dr. Ian McGilchrist.
111440	121280	Dr. Ian McGilchrist, good to meet you, sir. Very good to be with you, Nate. Thank you for asking me along.
123840	129360	I've been making it a habit when I say hello to people in other countries that I greet them in
129360	134480	their language, but since you're in Scotland, I didn't know if I should just start swearing or
134560	144160	how to greet someone in Scottish. Any kind of suitable animal noise that suggests some
144160	154160	appreciation will do. Let me bring you up to speed here. Some things you might not know.
155600	163120	20 years ago, I started my PhD. I left Wall Street because I could see how the pieces were
163120	168240	starting to connect and that humans were having a real problem with climate change, the environment,
169440	176880	resources, et cetera. I started my PhD with a British psychiatrist on my advisory committee
176880	183520	by the name of Dr. Peter Weibrow. We were going to look at why we don't so much face
184320	190320	an environmental problem or a resource problem, but a mismatch of the human brain with our current
190320	198960	situation. Then I ended up diving into energy and I left that aside, but reading your books and,
198960	204160	to be honest, I've had them for two months and I've not made my way through them. I called Daniel
204160	209520	Schmacktenberger and said, I'm interviewing Ian McGillchrist next week. Could you leave me some
209520	216640	pointers? He left me a 19-minute boxer that I would need a librarian to translate, but it seems
216720	227840	that all along you have been talking about the same thing, which is that our brains are driving
229040	235200	much of what's going on. I don't want to rehash what you've done on lots of other excellent
235200	241360	podcasts and videos and you sent me that animated video, which I think is great. I want to apply it
241360	247440	to this superorganism environmental dynamic, but for those people who are not familiar with your
247440	255840	work, could you give kind of an elevator pitch but a longish one on the core points in your two
255840	262080	main books, The Master and his Emissary and The Matter With Things, if you would?
262960	269200	Yes, I can do that. I think the first thing that I would point out is I don't believe that the brain
269200	276080	is driving these things in some sort of way. I believe that there are many causes of the crisis
276080	283280	that we're in now, some of them economic, some of them political, some of them sociological and it
283280	290000	has many aspects. So I'm not saying it's the brain that causes the crisis we're in, but the brain
290960	296000	has become hijacked in a way by the way we're thinking now and that that's important for us
296080	305040	to realise. So in those books, essentially they start from a few interesting questions which puzzle
305040	311200	me a lot and we're not talked about in my medical training. Why is the brain divided at all? If it's
311200	317520	this supercomputer, why waste computing power by dividing it into two chunks in this way?
319120	324640	I don't believe it is a computer by the way. I can tell you a half a dozen reasons why it's not
324640	333120	like a computer, but nonetheless, why is it divided? Why is it asymmetrical? And why for most of the
333120	340000	history of the brain has there been no band of fibres connecting them? It was a mammalian invention,
340000	343920	the corpus callosum, it's called the body of fibres at the base of the brain that connects the
343920	350800	two hemispheres. But the divided brain goes back millions of years, hundreds of millions of years
350800	355040	and the asymmetry of the brain goes back to the very earliest neural networks. Why?
356240	364560	And the answer to this is simple in a way, at least I think and nobody's suggested anything that goes
364560	371200	near it and explaining why we have this arrangement and nobody suggested I'm wrong to say this.
372480	380480	It stems from a Darwinian problem of survival. How do you pay narrow attention to something
380480	385520	that you need to manipulate to something you need to pick up if you're a bird get that seed
385520	392320	quickly, if you're a predator to catch your prey, if you want to pick up sticks or fashion tools,
392320	398880	you've got to have this very manipulative cast of mind in which you're going to target that
398880	405840	whatever it is that you know is important to you in detail. And that requires a very focused
405920	412480	narrow beam attention. If that's the only kind of attention you pay, then you will end up being
412480	416720	someone else's lunch while you're getting your own because you need to be on the lookout for
416720	423040	predators. You need to be on the lookout for your conspecifics, for your mate, for your offspring
423040	428960	that also need to be protected and fed. So the only way in which you can pay these two kinds of
428960	436640	attention at once is to have two neuronal masses each capable of disposing a kind of attention to
436640	445200	the world. One narrow targeted piecemeal, the other uncommitted, broad, sustained and vigilant.
446480	450560	Now that may not sound like a big deal, but the fact that there's a different way of attending
450560	457200	changes everything because how you attend governs what you find. And so effectively these two ways
457200	465600	of attending to the world build completely different images takes whatever you like to call
465600	471600	them of the world in our minds. I hesitate over image because it makes it sound it's just visual,
471600	477600	but I mean in every modality. And what are those differences? Well, there are about a dozen of
477600	484640	them that are isolable. But let me just say this, in the left hemisphere the world seems to be made
484640	491840	up of little bits that have no context, no meaning, they're isolated, atomistic, and if they have any
491840	497200	meaning at all it's because we put them together in some way for some purpose of our own. They're
497200	508160	abstracted from their embodied nature, from their physical context, relatively devoid of any kind
508160	515520	of meaning including emotional, spiritual meaning. And what you have there is a pretty much an
515520	521840	inanimate and mechanical world, a dead world. The right hemisphere on the other hand sees
521840	527680	the broad picture and it sees that everything is ultimately connected with everything else.
527680	533520	That unlike these fixed frames of the left hemisphere everything can be seen to be in
533520	540640	constant movement, nothing ever stops moving in the entire universe. It sees that everything is
540640	545440	what it is only in the context that it's in. So once you've isolated it you've lost most of its
545440	553920	meaning. It sees that, for example, the animals and the people that we see around us are embodied
553920	560640	and that's a very important part of their nature. It sees that the inner life, it sees what is
560720	566160	implicit whereas the left hemisphere sees only the explicit. As a result the left hemisphere
566160	573840	doesn't understand things like tone of voice, facial expressions, bodily gestures, puns,
574800	583200	metaphors, myths, narratives, rites, rituals, anything that isn't just the kind of thing you
583200	589200	could teach a machine by putting in a word box and a kind of syntax box it doesn't really get.
590000	596960	And it's also super confident that it's right. In fact because it knows so very little it thinks
596960	602400	it knows everything. There's something in psychology I'm sure you know called the Dunning-Kruger effect
602400	607120	which dictates that the less you know the more you think you know and the right hemisphere however
607120	614880	sees a great deal and has arranged things so that it can farm out the mere procedural work to the
614880	620160	left hemisphere so that it doesn't get distracted from its job of seeing the overall picture.
620160	628320	So these two work very well in harmony as long as the left hemisphere observes its role as an
628320	633680	adjunct to the right hemisphere. It sees less but it can do certain things very quickly in the way
633680	638960	that a PC can. I mean the PC doesn't know what you know you put data in it doesn't understand them
638960	644240	it spews stuff out it doesn't understand it you do the understanding the PC just does it quickly
644240	649760	and the left hemisphere is like as I say I resist the idea that the brain is a computer but just
649760	655360	for this purpose of this metaphor the left hemisphere is like the personal PC of the right
655360	661760	hemisphere that is the one that we can trust because it's more in touch with reality in every respect.
662480	669200	And so in I expound that to begin with in the master and his emissary and I do it at greater
669200	676560	length in the first part of the matter with things. In the second part of the master and his emissary I
676560	685040	say how has this changed if it has changed over the course of western civilization because I see
685040	691440	that around us we seem to be very much living in a world of the kind that the left hemisphere sees
691440	698560	unsophisticated untempered by what the right hemisphere could teach us. So has it always been
698560	704560	like this and my answer to that is no over the history of the west there have been three points
704560	710400	at which civilization seemed to embody the best of the two working together fruitfully.
710400	717280	And I'd say these moments are around the sixth century BC in ancient Greece around the year
717280	725840	dot in Rome and around the 1415 century the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe.
726560	732400	And at those moments we see something flourishing in the arts in the sciences everywhere because
732400	738240	these hemispheres are feeding one another but in every case after a period of time
738240	743520	things seem to fossilize they become more mechanical more hierarchical more stereotype more
743520	750000	bureaucratic more legalistic and the imaginative part that helps us see and understand the world
750000	756400	we live in begins to erode and the civilization collapses it collapsed in Greece it collapsed in
756400	764240	Rome and it's collapsing for us now I believe. In the matter with things I do a little bit more
765120	771200	and I look more at the philosophical implications of this so I look at the way what neurology can
771200	777040	teach us about the hemispheres what philosophy can teach us about the hemispheres and what physics
777040	784080	can tell us about the world that we live in and I find that these three parts lead from different
784080	790160	very different starting points to the same picture of the world which is very close to the one the
790160	795440	right hemisphere has of something that is never fixed and certain that is always evolving that
795440	802800	is in process that is complex beautiful rich interconnected animate rather than the dead
802800	808320	world of mechanistic reductionism so that's it in a nutshell there's a lot more to say but you
808320	815520	can ask me if you're interested. I am interested and I've got like 14 prepared questions for you
815520	820960	and I think I'm just going to scrap those and ask you whatever comes to my mind because I have a
820960	834320	ton of questions so the left brain puts the bits together and creates a narrative that suits us
834320	841840	right so it uses the left brain in kind of a internal authority bias sort of way and dominates
841840	848320	the narrative which could explain why there's so many people that are cocksure that they understand
848320	855920	the world and trump is right or biden is right or you know climate change is a hoax or we're all
855920	864720	going extinct that it gives people like a overly self-confident because it helps themselves in
864720	871360	their own fitness. I think the left hemisphere envisages only the sort of thing it can know
872320	878880	and it knows how to put things together and make something and so it decides that the world must
878880	884880	be made like that from little bit and in doing so it completely misunderstands its nature and it
884880	893040	produces that kind of cocksure certainty which is surely the sign of a lack of wisdom one of the
893040	898800	signs of wisdom is that one feels less certain that one knows rather than more certain that one
898800	906240	knows in general so yeah I do think that yeah. Did you ever have a chance to watch uh we were
906240	911600	emailing a couple months back the the latest episode with Daniel Schmockenberger and I on
911600	918240	artificial intelligence where we really it was only a little bit on AI it was mostly about how
918240	927360	humans have had narrow boundary criteria nation states economic systems have outcompeted
928000	934960	wide boundary more wisdom types of systems. Did you ever listen to that and what do you think
934960	941360	about that? Intelligence versus wisdom is a little bit of a narrow boundary goal versus a wide
941360	948960	boundary goal. I did listen to part of it but I didn't listen to all of it and I'm very interested
948960	956320	in Daniel's work and he and I are going to do a couple of things together but what I'd say about
956320	964160	that is that first of all human beings are not just the squalid competitive apes that we are
964160	970800	made out to be we have many many interesting traits we are social animals we know how to
970800	977120	sacrifice for another and indeed the history of evolution is as much a history of cooperation
977120	982240	as it is of competition competition is very important of course but the cooperation has
982240	988560	been neglected and we do know how to cooperate and when we're working well both the hemisphere
988560	993840	cooperate with one another and we cooperate with one another so the history I mean the
993840	998240	history of the west is the one that I know best I haven't attempted to write about the history of
998240	1004000	the east though I suspect it will tell a different story until very recently when it seems to become
1004000	1009280	occidentalized in the most lamentable way taking all our worst sins upon it but anyway
1009840	1020000	and yeah I mean I think that is right wisdom is always going to be relatively rare and involves
1020000	1027040	a lot of things it involves the putting together of a life well lived and the experience that comes
1027040	1035440	from that with an understanding of history a sense of the spiritual and an ability to aggregate
1036080	1044960	information but at the moment I'd say that information is triumphant over a true understanding
1046000	1052800	and an understanding is what intelligence requires and means so that much of the time
1052800	1058800	we're amassing information and we kind of know in a technical way certain things we probably know
1058800	1064640	more in that sense than than humanity has ever known but we're also in my view less wise than
1064640	1070960	humanity has ever been this fact that we can know things and can do things has gone to our heads
1070960	1078800	and made us hubristic vain and ridiculous because we think we can solve everything but we don't
1078800	1084640	understand a half of what we've got hold of here so I think AI is a problem yeah so how
1084640	1091600	how does that map from an individual to a culture because as individuals we have left
1091600	1095840	hemispheres and right hemispheres and we have a corpus callosum that divides them
1096400	1103760	and is getting larger over time implying that there's some narrative control going on
1104320	1109440	but our culture doesn't have a left or a right hemisphere so is it just the proportion of the
1109440	1115920	population that is kind of tilted in one direction that periodically you said there were a couple
1116000	1120640	historical cultures that flourished because they had more of a balanced
1122240	1127040	what's the difference between individuals population and the whole culture with respect
1127040	1134560	to this phenomenon yes it's a reasonable question and of course I'm not suggesting that
1134560	1140640	physically the brain has changed enormously since 2000 years ago it will have changed a bit
1140640	1145920	because it's always involving but it's not that I'm referring to and it's that we use the brain
1145920	1151280	in in different ways we can choose to listen to one part of the brain more than another
1151280	1159120	and I think that what happens it as a society becomes a powerful civilization a number of
1159120	1165920	things happen one is that it over reaches itself either in terms of its territory or its military
1165920	1174560	and economic power and in doing that it needs to be able to control or thinks it needs to be able
1174560	1188000	to control a vast ever vast panoply of of elements in human life and to do that it needs to simplify
1188080	1196240	to roll out as we say a bureaucratic system and so forth so as a civilization becomes too large
1196240	1201600	and over reaches itself it moves more and more towards a kind of left hemisphere thinking
1201600	1206960	that helps it with the map the theory the diagram of life rather than the actual business of life
1207680	1211120	and I think the other thing that happens well there are many things that happened I think
1211120	1215680	there are about half a dozen that I refer to in the preface to the matter with things
1216240	1222640	um sorry the preface to the martian is emissary and take much further in the matter with things
1222640	1230960	but one is something that the great philosopher A. N. Whitehead said that a civilization thrives
1230960	1237120	until it over analyzes itself and I think that what's happening in our world is we're we don't
1237120	1244160	really live connected so much to nature we don't live connected to a spiritual tradition we don't
1244160	1252720	live connected to our history and culture we our art has become too intellectualized it's become too
1252720	1260880	conceptual not powerful visceral and metaphoric in its nature as most great art is and so we've
1260880	1267600	been cut loose and we're all kind of at a loss and when we try to talk to one another across
1267600	1274640	these spaces we tend to talk in very theoretical terms so people talk about a theory of politics a
1274640	1280320	theory of economics and a theory of how people behave and so usually this is inaccurate over
1280320	1288320	simple and so it's that that gets us into this frame of mind because the left hemisphere's message
1288320	1295440	is money for old road it's incredibly simple we're just apes that compete for territory money and power
1295440	1302080	that's the left hemisphere's knowledge because let me put it this way the left hemisphere's
1302080	1307600	resolve debt is to make us powerful to help us grab things it controls the right hand which
1307600	1315040	from most of us is the one which we do the grabbing and the manipulating and it helps us maintain power
1315040	1320000	but all the rest of the understanding of everything else that humans are capable of the life of
1320960	1328560	the spirit the life of of of morality of beauty of goodness of truth all these things are somehow
1328560	1335440	left out of this picture and become somehow marginalized or trivialized as they have done
1335440	1341280	I believe in our culture at the moment and so why I wrote the matter with things was because I could
1341280	1347280	see that we all agree there is something that is the matter with things I mean very few people think
1347280	1356560	everything's going fine right now but it's also a notice of the fact that we overvalue
1356560	1363360	matter in the most simple sense I actually say that materialists are not people who overvalue
1363360	1367440	matter they're people who undervalue matter because matter is a very extraordinary thing
1368080	1375280	matter is wonderful but this kind of simple idea of matter is what we we tend to overestimate the
1375280	1384000	power of the consciousness and the spirit the mind is is somehow a secondary secretion of
1384560	1390080	matter which it cannot be and that we've made a world up out of things which is how the left hand
1390080	1397040	is here puts things together whereas I believe the importance in in everything lies in relationship
1397040	1400960	not in what we call the things themselves that are related
1402080	1407280	So many thoughts Ian let me let me go off on a tangent here
1409840	1418160	I would say that historically the animus religions would probably have a better
1418160	1424400	balance between the left and the right hemispheres and the story that I've put together with the
1424480	1434240	energy hungry emergent cultural super organism kind of started with the agricultural revolution
1434240	1444720	10 to 12,000 years ago which was in many ways a fall from grace because we were living close
1444720	1454240	to limits but we were living with the right brain appreciation of the relationships with ourselves
1454240	1462240	with our surroundings with nature with other species is it possible that as the population
1462240	1471760	expanded and then exploded that our world is so full of things and stories about the things
1471760	1479440	and advertising about the things that the left brain has no choice but to intercede and take over
1480240	1483200	I'm just speculating what do you what do you think about all that
1485360	1492240	Well I think it's very tempting for the left hemisphere to think that it's going to understand
1492240	1501120	these things but that is part of the problem I think you're right about animistic cultures
1501920	1510320	I'm not saying that animism is you know the answer to philosophy not in the least
1510320	1515200	but I think it's a way of understanding something that's very important which is the
1515200	1522400	relationship of life to the world at large including things that are in our purview that
1522400	1528320	we wouldn't normally call animate in fact if you suppress the left hemisphere which you can do
1529280	1535440	experimentally people see things that we would call inanimate sometimes as animate
1536000	1539840	and if you do the opposite and suppress the right hemisphere they begin to see
1539840	1546560	even people and animals as like machines or pieces of furniture so I think animism is an expression
1546560	1554960	of a kind of vision that we could learn from but I think subsequent philosophy has gone much
1554960	1561280	further in that and I don't know if we want to go there but I hold a view called panentheism
1561280	1568000	which is that God is in everything and everything is in God and I think that in fact the great loss
1568000	1575360	in our time is of any spiritual or moral compass any sense of our groundedness in a cosmos that is
1575360	1581760	beautiful has a direction to it and has meaning in it I mean we're taught that we just paint these
1581760	1587360	things on the walls of ourselves to cheer ourselves up that we invent meaning and values
1587360	1592480	and purpose I don't believe this at all in fact the long book the matter with things is
1592480	1598080	demonstrating exactly how wrong that is and that in fact we don't invent them but we discover them
1598080	1604240	we literally find them or fail to find them depending on who we are is it possible that
1604240	1609920	eight billion well look before I ask that you just said you can suppress the left hemisphere
1609920	1616560	experimentally is that like in a medical situation or can you are there some parlor tricks you can
1616560	1623440	do at home because that might be a good thing if we all did those experiments as they used to say
1623440	1632480	in those films don't attempt this at home okay okay yeah um I'm talking about um I'm talking
1632480	1638400	effectively about something called transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a a process that
1638400	1645760	will be done in a in a hospital setting or at least in a in a yes in a clinical setting
1646480	1654640	Ian let me tell you a story let me tell you a story three years ago I was chainsawing on my
1654640	1661840	property here and I had to crawl under the horse fence to get to the tree and it's electrified
1661840	1668960	and the electrical fence hit me squarely on the top of my head and it hurt so badly
1668960	1676560	for five seconds for the next five hours I was in this like zen state where I felt connected
1676560	1683040	to everything I didn't have like a compulsion to check my phone it was weird and I just always
1683040	1686240	wondered if that was like a miniature version of what you're describing
1687120	1694880	but it's a wonderful story thank you I wouldn't like to say really really but I mean of course
1694880	1702800	just in case anybody's listening who who knows somebody or has ECT it it's done with an anaesthetic
1702800	1708960	now and you're not aware of it so it's all fine but okay in any case yet passing electric
1708960	1715680	current through the brain surely does make some changes um yeah where were we we were talking
1715680	1721360	about yeah you can isolate one at a time but not you know not to try it at home yeah and and
1722480	1729920	you asked me that question probably for some reason is there a test that you could give people
1729920	1734880	other than walking into a cocktail party and talking to someone for five year five minutes and
1734880	1739760	realizing that they're pretty much left brain dominant but is there is there a test like a
1739840	1746240	psychological test that can see where people are on on behaviorally on this spectrum or is it not
1746240	1752000	that refined no I mean there are some terrible things on the internet that tell you whether
1752000	1756080	you're left or right brain but just forget that forget most of everything that's on the internet
1756080	1763920	unless it comes from me on this topic because it's going to repeat the awful old the awful
1764080	1769120	old canards about about the the two hemispheres but no there are proper
1771760	1777760	neuropsychological instruments as we call them that can be administered questionnaires
1778800	1785600	and can score people but again largely these things were generated before the huge body
1785600	1793360	of work that I have done and is the 2000 pages or more of these two books together
1794400	1801280	which really has completely changed the landscape on hemisphere difference most of the things that
1801280	1807840	people used to say are wrong and there are one or two things that are broadly right but so it is
1807840	1814080	important and you can tell yes but I mean especially for psychiatrists you can you can tell fairly
1814080	1822160	quickly if somebody's autistic and autism is a condition which has different manifestations
1822160	1828640	I think there are autism rather than one simple autism but the communist form of autism is rather
1828640	1834880	like trying to understand the world on the basis of your left hemisphere alone here's another question
1834880	1840160	and I'm going to run out of questions I mean I won't run out of questions so I've been involved
1840160	1848240	in this systems ecology group for 20 years I've got hundreds and hundreds of contacts who live
1848320	1856240	around the world who are looking at how energy, money, climate change, biodiversity, politics,
1856240	1864480	anthropology fit together into cohesive story I would say that relative to the standard population
1865280	1873520	the preponderance of people with Asperger's or something similar is very much high in this group
1873520	1879520	of people and I wonder if it's something to do with the ability to separate out the noise
1880240	1886640	which the left brain is very good at focusing on and stepping back and looking at the whole
1886640	1892560	picture total speculation just wondering if you have any input there. Well I wouldn't want to be
1892560	1896960	dogmatic and I think that might come into it but there are a couple of other things that come to
1896960	1909520	mind and one is the capacity for systematization of a linear and left hemisphere congruent kind
1910400	1922000	which people with Asperger's or autism have and the other is something I have noticed and was
1922000	1929840	noticed by others particularly by an important German psychiatrist called Kretschmer in the 1930s
1930640	1938640	that people who are either come from families of the printer either schizophrenia or autism
1938640	1950400	or Asperger's the subjects often are very focused on doing good in the abstract but are often not
1950400	1959280	very good at being warm or kind to individual people so they embrace you know a brilliant idea
1959280	1964560	that we're going to make the world like this and of course we need people like that but we also need
1964560	1971120	to have them have their feet planted firmly on the ground because as is well known the most
1971840	1977920	desperate homicidal and tyrannical regimes in the history of the world started out with people
1977920	1982560	having an idea how to make humanity better and forcing them to be better.
1983360	1994240	There are ways that we can expand our boundaries of empathy and care and start to recognize that
1994240	2001520	we're part of a whole that we're related to all other life on the planet that this is the one blue
2001600	2010960	green oasis in a dark cold universe and I think we are approaching a species level conversation
2010960	2018080	so your work I actually think is foundational to that that we have to shift from a me to an us
2018640	2025600	somehow. Now there's been in the last couple years a lot of movement towards psychedelics like
2025600	2038640	ayahuasca or five MEO DMT from toad or mushrooms or non-drugs like chanting or rave parties or just
2038640	2048240	going out in nature but can these substances access the relational skills of the right brain
2048240	2054800	or what do you think about all that? Well in brief the psychedelics which to me are relatively
2054800	2061680	uninteresting though they can indeed have lasting effects on people I know from personal testimonies
2061680	2069680	of people not my own that this can happen. I don't think that it's liberating the right hemisphere
2070400	2075920	and I explain why I don't think that's what's happening in the matter with things I think
2075920	2082240	probably what is happening is that the frontal lobes are being suppressed and the frontal lobes are
2082240	2093440	if you like the filters that by their effect of inhibiting the more posterior cortex shape our
2093440	2100560	reality by making sense of it and so when you take them off you get a flood of stimuli with no particular
2102400	2109040	you know way of having filtered that perhaps in the absence of filtering by the frontal cortex
2109040	2115520	we are more open to spiritual messages but I think that there are very many other ways that we can
2115520	2123440	much more sound ways you know it's being very much promoted psychedelics as the answer to
2123440	2130800	depression and other things but the reason for that is that it will cost the pharmaceutical
2130800	2136160	industry absolutely nothing to market these substances they're already known and they will
2136160	2141040	have they'll never need to work again because they can just make money out of providing these
2141040	2149200	purified substances and so they are very much skewing the the dialogue on this and what's not
2149200	2155040	known so widely is that you can have terrible experiences using psychedelics which are
2155600	2162560	devastating to your psyche so you're playing with fire so I would like to take the conversation
2162560	2168480	away from that and to the things that really really do matter if you're happy with that which are
2169920	2179040	relating to a society to a social group relating to nature and relating to
2180160	2187920	some whatever you like to call it higher power divine ground the sacred these things are not
2187920	2194080	just my opinion that they're important for us there is vast research that shows that they are
2195440	2203520	very important for mental well-being for physical well-being well-being for cognitive skill
2204480	2213680	and for the cohesion of a society so clearly the sacred or the belief in any deity or god
2213680	2219760	or anything like that has to emanate from the right hemisphere so
2221360	2231600	right now to me it seems like the belief in religion is is waning as the driving force
2231600	2238880	relative to the last couple hundred years but also right now the belief in economic growth
2238880	2245440	or the you know capitalism and economic growth has become a religion of sorts
2246080	2252720	so neither of those I mean that's what our sacred is now and you don't know much about my work Ian but
2253520	2260800	I'm a champion for the 10 million other species we share this planet with and I deeply view the
2260800	2268160	natural world as sacred and that's what's our calling right now is we kind of had to go through
2268160	2279760	this last 200 years of Las Vegas smorgasbord uh energy um orgy of of of things uh to maybe recognize
2279760	2289680	whoa uh maybe the next technology is inner tech in our minds um towards this this sacred
2289680	2292560	destination uh what what do you think about all that
2296640	2304000	well first of all I'm I you know that that I believe in the importance of the other living
2304720	2313280	elements of our of our planet um and even even things that we think of as inanimate and exploits
2313840	2320080	have their value and their place so I wholly agree with you we're we're seeing from the
2320080	2326400	hape same hymn sheet there I'm not sure that religion only comes from the right hemisphere
2326400	2332400	but I do think you're right that the most important parts of religious experience and practice seem
2332400	2338880	to be the consensus is seem to be underwritten by the right hemisphere the left hemisphere is
2338880	2347920	was necessary for systematizing it and turning it into a durable um phenomenon such as Christianity
2347920	2359120	or whatever it may be Islam or but but in doing so it often over legalizes makes over certain
2359120	2366880	over fixed what should be less certain more fluid more or inspiring in fact I think we've
2366880	2376160	lost the capacity for three very important things a sense of awe or wonder a sense of our own humility
2376800	2384000	and or the humility we should have and compassion and I think these are the things that
2385440	2389520	most religions that are real religions or spiritual traditions that are true spiritual
2389520	2397600	traditions have in common that they induce and re re can kindle in us a sense of wonder
2398480	2405200	they make us feel appropriately humble about what we can do and what we can know and they increase
2406560	2414480	sense of oneness with and compassion towards the rest of the created world now I think that is
2414720	2422240	is what's going wrong I think this we've completely failed to understand that religion is not
2423360	2429280	about a matter of propositional belief but dispositional belief belief is a matter of
2429280	2434720	a disposition of your your your consciousness towards the world in a certain way it's not
2434720	2440560	about propositions that you know six impossible things that you have to believe before breakfast
2441280	2447440	that's not for a relationship about and what I want to do in in my work is take people from a
2447440	2452160	standpoint where they will almost certainly be part of the the culture that believes that only
2452160	2461280	somebody rather simple or you know uneducated would think that there was a divine realm to
2461280	2467200	position where they will see that only somebody who's rather simple or uneducated would think that
2467200	2471840	would just want to rule that out I'm not saying would become suddenly religious but I think it's
2471840	2482160	extremely clear that people who either are fundamentalist religious or fundamentalist
2482160	2486800	atheists are on the wrong track and that they have more in common with one another than they
2486800	2492800	have with true believing people in any case I just think that that business of the ever-evolving
2492880	2498080	deeper relationship a loving relationship with the world in all its manifestations
2498720	2505520	is is the secret of human well-being and happiness and you say that there is now a
2505520	2513120	different religion that of economic growth and so on and I you know have quenched in myself in
2513120	2518320	the last 24 hours of it with with what you've you've said about this I find it very compelling
2518640	2524480	I'm sure you're you're broadly right and it reminds me of something that GK Chesterton said
2524480	2529360	that when people stop believing in God they don't believe in nothing they believe in anything
2531120	2540880	and that anything for them is their own power to become more and more rich powerful wealthy and
2540880	2547360	that leaves out of the count just about everything that sustains human happiness and in the seeking
2547440	2553360	for it they will never find happiness as a psychiatrist I can tell you that the most
2553360	2558560	successful people the richest people the most powerful people are not the world's happiest people
2559760	2565760	as a former high net worth stockbroker on wall street I totally concur with that assessment
2567600	2574480	so you mentioned earlier there were some previous cultures that were successful at this empathy and
2574560	2581840	compassion and a sense of you didn't mention sacred but what were the commonalities in these
2581840	2589760	societies and how did that evolve or don't we have historical data to know what happened
2590320	2597920	yes it's difficult one thing that's a surprise is that a properly functioning society in which
2597920	2602560	the two hemispheres are really working in the complementary but asymmetrical way that they
2602560	2612720	should seem to arise just like that that you think that the civilization took a very long time to
2612720	2620640	build you know but actually these civilizations just sort of seem to arise in a relatively short
2620640	2627040	time span and work well and then gradually always move further towards the right hemisphere and one
2627040	2633200	of the aspects of this is I could put it this way that the left hemisphere is always trying to
2633200	2638880	close down on a certainty but the right hemisphere is always trying to open up to a possibility
2639600	2643520	and that explains much of the difference between the way the hemisphere see the world
2644320	2652800	and in these early stages of civilization people are very open to possibility and this is a very
2652880	2659040	fruitful frame of mind they have very few sentences but they know that nothing will
2659040	2664960	prosper unless they give of themselves it's no good sitting back and waiting for it to build
2664960	2673600	itself so a civilization goes through one might say three phrases really and and and this is
2674560	2681520	being very beautifully written about by Patrick Offalls in a book called a moderate greatness
2681520	2688720	a very short book when he points out that he was on this podcast Ian oh was he oh fantastic
2688720	2694400	well he's a bit of a good friend of mine oh yeah that's great he's 90 years old and he's sharp as
2694400	2702800	attack he's just great I'm always recommending his book to people but as you know I mean he suggested
2702800	2710400	in the first phase people are very brave um they they give of themselves they're generous spirited
2710400	2715760	they create things and they defend them and so on and then there comes a period when the as
2715760	2720800	well the groundwork has been laid and now we can move on to more sophisticated things we get the
2721600	2728080	arising of philosophy and art and and so forth and that's a very benign phase but after a while
2728080	2733120	we go into a decadent phase where people just expect that this is the normal that they don't
2733120	2738640	have to do anything for it to carry on that it's their right that it is you know I'm always when
2738720	2745760	people say a right I always a little mental question where does this right come from exactly
2745760	2749360	I'm not saying that there is no use for the term right but I think it needs to be
2750160	2756320	you know thought about rather more carefully than we do anyway I think this is what happens and I can
2756320	2765520	see certainly movements in eastern civilizations which all my life have fascinated me I'm probably
2765840	2773360	a Taoist um I'm probably a Buddhist um and I'm very interested in the Vedanta
2774160	2781520	and in these traditions you see a kind of wisdom that comes from a degree of humility
2781520	2788560	of letting go of control of letting go of certain knowledge in order to attain wisdom
2789440	2794880	you know the the Tao De Ching begins with the line the Tao that can be named is not the real Tao
2795600	2801360	and you know it also contains the lines that the master does nothing but nothing is left undone
2801360	2807360	I mean that those those need to be glossed but they're really a way of saying that our obsession
2807360	2816080	with immediate action and doing and being busy and increasing our knowledge is actually a way of
2816080	2822000	stopping ourselves achieving either peace or wisdom and in the context of this conversation
2822480	2827520	I mean whether people in achieve peace for themselves it's a personal matter but if they
2827520	2833440	don't achieve some wisdom if there aren't people speaking wisely our civilization is definitely
2833440	2842160	doomed so again this is our first conversation um despite having mutual friends and mutual interest
2842160	2849920	one of the key learnings for me this past decade uh in brain research was that humans didn't evolve
2850880	2859680	to see reality um fitness at the time mattered more than than truth and I I've taught a class
2860240	2865760	at the University of Minnesota called Reality 101 a survey of the human predicament
2866560	2875200	and it's an environmental class for mostly for freshmen but can learning about reality about
2875280	2881360	the different hemispheres about our brains about supernormal stimuli and and all the different
2882000	2888880	things we inherited from our ancestors um and their interrelationships can that change
2889440	2895760	our behavior at the individual and ultimately at the couch cultural level or does it have to come
2895760	2904400	at a two-part question so my work here with this podcast is to educate and warn people about the
2904400	2912000	future that Patrick Ophels uh also believes is happening is that our energy surplus declines
2912000	2918800	and as the the carrying capacity and environmental health of our world decline we're we're in for a
2918800	2928880	tough road um so in my articulating and having conversations with you and others do the facts
2928880	2938960	matter or is it really a do we need like a new narrative of meaning of sacredness and the facts
2938960	2945680	don't matter as much that's that's a big bite what what do you think about that I think facts are
2945680	2958000	important um I think in certain areas of life claiming things to be facts needs to be carefully done
2959760	2967680	but the but we shouldn't lose the sense that there are facts I think that what science teaches us
2967680	2976560	is important very important as a road to truth I think that reason properly understood are you
2976560	2985360	not just a kind of rationalizing about things that could be done by chat GPT but I mean the fusion
2985360	2992560	of the experience of a life well lived and judgment based on that and the ability to see
2992560	2998880	things in the overall context combined with the ability to think clearly and express oneself clearly
2998880	3004560	is very important I also think that letting go of those things is important because they have
3004560	3010400	limitations they can't expect to be used to answer some of the big questions which appear
3010400	3017600	paradoxical to the left hemisphere but nonetheless are on the path to the deep realities as
3019040	3028880	Niels Bohr perhaps the greatest figure in the genesis of quantum physics said and as the great
3028880	3035200	leaders of most religious leads in the mystical traditions of most religions and spiritual pathways
3035200	3042000	have said so in the second part of the matter with things the first part I'm just looking at
3042000	3048880	really what we need to understand about the left hemisphere's incapacity to be in touch with the
3048880	3053840	real world compared with the right hemisphere now that's the reverse of what the prop psychology
3053840	3061040	thing tells us the left hemisphere may be boring and down to earth but at least it's you know it's
3061120	3066800	reliable um however that's not the case it's extremely unreliable compared with the right
3066800	3072160	hemisphere which is much more in touch with reality and a much better touchstone when we
3072160	3077840	come to decide what we should believe anyway that's part one but in part two I look at the various
3077840	3084880	pathways to truth and I say they are science reason and intuition and imagination and that
3084880	3090240	all four of these need to be brought to bear if we're going to function properly as a society and
3090480	3096880	understand who we are what we're doing here and how we are to relate to the world at large
3097760	3101840	and then in the last part of the book it's metaphysics and I look at things like
3101840	3109040	the the coincidence of opposites the one and the many but also things like time space matter
3109040	3116400	consciousness values purpose and the sense of the sacred so I'm looking at all of those things
3116400	3123040	so what I want to say is my book is based on science and on a lot of philosophizing so there's
3123040	3130880	a great deal of facts in it I quote in one book five thousand five hundred sources and in the other
3130880	3136960	about two and a half thousand so together there's a lot so I do rely on those things and I think
3136960	3143920	that our tendency to to um for example dismiss science if it happens to say things that are not
3144000	3150480	fashionable or politically correct is absolutely a disaster for us all and for science so
3151040	3159120	science is non-negotiable in that sense and although everything can you need to look at
3159120	3164720	the light in which it's interpreted but we can't do away with it so I think understanding
3165600	3172560	what is going on in our heads and how it's affecting the way we see the world is really
3172560	3184560	important and in that sense I'd go as far as to say that if we're to get out of this situation
3184560	3188560	people always say so what are we to do what are we to do and they want you know half a dozen bullet
3188560	3193920	points and are you know half a dozen bullet points that I can give but in a way they're
3193920	3197840	they're at a very low level they're like practical things that can be done now and they're not
3197920	3204560	unimportant but actually I know that unless we change the whole way we conceive what humanity
3204560	3210240	is what the world is and how the two create connect we will not get this right and it
3210240	3215360	wouldn't even matter if we did save our skins because we would not have saved our souls and
3215360	3222080	without that we would just continue being the same frustrated greedy desperate people that we
3222080	3229600	seem to be now so I think we have to see the predicament and the reason I think that I would
3229600	3235680	like as many people as possible to read and talk about my work is it's a contribution to that debate
3235680	3242240	you know that it's a really substantial thing that it costs me you know decades of my life and I
3242240	3246960	think that people are responding to it by the messages I get all the time from people saying
3247040	3252640	your your work has changed my life now if most writers if they get that once they're delighted
3252640	3257760	but I get that get that every day in fact today amongst several messages that kind of got one
3257760	3262960	that said it would be an underestimate to say that your work has changed my life so I'm not I'm
3262960	3267840	delighted always to hear this because I don't know I can only tell whether this is important from
3267840	3273920	the reactions I get from other people but I think unless you know I'm a psychiatrist and I learned
3273920	3279680	very early on that you can tell what people need to do very very early on and you can say it but
3279680	3284560	they won't do it because they need to have been brought to the place where they see for themselves
3284560	3290080	that that's what they need to do so we need to get humanity to a point where they see for themselves
3290080	3298960	that what they're doing is crazy suicidal are you taking on new patients no
3299040	3307760	no I'm 70 and I had to make a decision some time ago that you know I was going to write and
3307760	3315520	lecture rather than carry on with the day job so no I was being facetious but what you just said
3315520	3322480	rings hella true to me so I was being facetious so what I hear you saying is that science is
3322480	3329600	necessary but insufficient and that if we look at the human predicament with climate change and
3330160	3336160	population and resource depletion and everything else and if we try to construct a path through
3336160	3344480	that using only engineers and architects we will fail because we have to look at the other uh what
3344480	3350240	did you say imagination creativity you had four four categories we have to integrate all of those
3350240	3357840	intuition and imagination and I know that intuition is often a target for people in cognitive
3357840	3362720	neuroscience and of course some people have made a career out of it like Dan Kahneman and
3362720	3369440	professionally suspicious of intuition I talk about his work which is in many ways very important
3369440	3376000	in in my book the matter of things but I think that intuitions had a bad rap and because there
3376000	3380320	are certain situations which are the highly artificial in which you can show that following
3380320	3386160	your intuition won't lead to the right answer that is the flip side of the fact that we are
3387040	3395600	we are able to make very complex decisions fairly quickly using intuition although
3395600	3402560	intuition is not thinking fast sometimes intuitions are deep and take a long time to come
3402560	3409200	through and sometimes rationalizing is what we do thinking fast and quickly so you know people
3409200	3415040	sometimes say is Kahneman's you know type one thinking um the right hemisphere and type two
3415040	3419280	thinking left no if anything it would be the other way around but it's really more that
3420560	3426880	type one thinking is sub-cortical is kind of almost instinctive whereas a richer
3427440	3434480	combination of intuition and reason involves both hemispheres so it's a it's a different thing but
3434480	3442320	anyway I just wanted to put in a word for intuition because I think our willingness to um discard
3442320	3450320	discontent to and um generally despise our intuitions is one of the reasons we've become so
3450320	3457040	stupid I mean there are many things that I believe now that if there is a humanity in the future
3457040	3464080	people will look back on it as the most absurd era we are part of the most ridiculous era of
3464080	3471440	humanity in which completely improbable and very stupid things are said by highly intelligent
3471440	3476720	people and if they had any contact at all with their intuitions they would guide them to a much
3476720	3484160	much wiser place so I suspect that lots of people in our culture have trauma
3485520	3492640	we are living through an absolute crazy twilight zone sort of era a lot of people are stressed
3493280	3500240	I think intuitively the listeners and viewers of this program will agree with you that they would
3500320	3508240	like to expand or lean into their right brain more they want to be connected with the birds and the
3508240	3514800	trees and their garden and with relationships at a slower pace and they see how everything is connected
3514800	3519360	and they care like you and I do about the 10 million other species we share the planet with
3520000	3526240	but the needs of the day we have to have a job to get health insurance otherwise we go broke if we
3526240	3532800	get sick we have to build defense mechanisms against all the polarization shouting on on
3532800	3541360	YouTube and in social media are the wants of the day forcing the left brain to take over and not
3541360	3548400	allow people to reflect on the relationships between everything what what do you think about that
3548400	3553360	well let me be clear there is nothing wrong with the left hemisphere in itself
3553760	3560000	it's a very valuable servant it is the emissary to the master and as such is irreplaceable we need
3560000	3568080	it and we need the work that it can do all I'm really saying is that it must be aware that it
3568080	3573920	is a servant not the master and at the moment it thinks it's the master it thinks it has all the
3573920	3580880	answers and that's the bit that makes it a problem so I'm not saying of course I'm not and I think
3581840	3588320	I started what I've just been saying by saying that we really do need the everyday stuff we need
3588320	3596240	the jobs and we need to put in place particular measures legal measures maybe scientific plans
3596240	3602480	to try and stop the poisoning of the oceans all that all of that I agree with but what I'm really
3602480	3609200	saying is that that's not enough that's only a part of the story and and perhaps in some ways
3610080	3614960	although it sounds stupid to say this is less important than being able to see things
3615840	3621360	in a different way because if we did we wouldn't need we wouldn't need to be doing it all by
3621920	3628240	constraint and restraint we need constraints and restraints in life one of the paradoxes is that
3628240	3634720	for a society to be free it needs to observe certain restraints but when you say we need to have
3635680	3641680	um whatever it was you said mechanisms in place to sort of police the social media
3642560	3650880	if we were more aware of the shallowness as a way we talk and think so often nowadays
3651440	3656560	in sound bites and without having really thought about things deeply and probably not from a
3656560	3663520	background of humane education which is now a rarity compared with what it was 40 50 years ago
3664400	3670720	if we were aware of that there wouldn't be the need to police it in that way you know I mean
3670720	3676880	during my lifetime people have become obviously much less civilized they've become um
3678080	3683120	willing and able to treat one another with greater violence verbal physical and in other
3683120	3691680	ways so we're not we're in a realm where we're so badly dehumanized already that the only way
3691680	3697600	to help is by imposing kind of rules which in themselves constrain our better nature
3699120	3708080	as well as our unfortunate tendencies of of now so in that last bit you mentioned the word
3708080	3716000	aware or awareness four times I right now have a new coach who's an expert in something called
3716000	3726320	Feldenkrais which is awareness through movement and her advice to me is all I'm asking for you is
3727440	3733920	for awareness and once you become aware of something then for the first time you have choices
3734560	3740800	and a couple days ago she sent me this beautiful quote by Victor Frankel between stimulus and
3740800	3749840	response there is a space in that space is our power to choose our response in our response lies
3749840	3756480	our growth and our freedom so I'm just wondering how that maps if at all to the left brain right
3756480	3762880	brain story that you're unpacking is the left brain jumping into this space in our culture
3762880	3769280	and then owning the narrative in response and would more awareness kind of give us a more
3769280	3777200	merger of the two hemispheres in a healthy way what I'd certainly say is that that is a wonderful
3777200	3785520	the quote that I know from Victor Frankel who is a very very great man of course and I think that
3786800	3793200	what I'm suggesting without going one way or other on the hemispheres is that we
3794080	3805120	are too ready to jump in we have lost the art of thinking deeply of pondering of embracing silence
3806080	3812880	of thinking in a longer term over a broader span which you narrow
3815440	3820320	especially and temporally if you like in the way in which we think we're too committed to a point
3820320	3827040	of view that we may never have been taught to challenge and so forth so what I'm saying is
3827040	3837120	that we live in a society that is becoming stupid because reflective reading proper acquaintance
3837120	3845840	with history not in some ridiculous propagandizing way in which we either uncritically accept it or
3845840	3854320	uncritically despise it but in fact trying to understand the people who are not necessarily
3854320	3859440	any less wise than we were who came before us and what they created for us and what we owe to them
3860080	3867840	so not having that not having been taught to think on two sides of a question we're reacting in
3867840	3874560	two peremptory way and slowing down would be a very very fine thing most of what we do would be
3874560	3880400	better done more slowly there are very few things that are done well by just speeding them up and
3880400	3885840	yet we live in a world which is constantly demanding more and more speed less and less reflection
3886560	3895680	right and so we're compelled to use the devil's tools to do guy's work of a sort I mean I feel
3895680	3901680	that every day I mean look at us we're using you know high technology to communicate these ideas
3901760	3908800	to more people in an attempt to hopefully have people learn and slow down in their own lives
3909360	3915920	so so so getting to that one of my prior guests who I believe is a friend of yours Tomas Bjorkman
3917120	3925280	he's an advocate of nurturing inner development skills which he categorizes as being thinking
3925280	3935840	relating collaborating and and acting so do you think reflective practices and teachings such as
3935840	3943440	those can can reconnect the balancing of the two hemispheres or leaving this hemisphere's aside
3943440	3951520	just make us more holistic human beings in this time of of tumult yes I do um
3951520	3960320	um there are certain things we can't experience unless we slow down and that we must experience
3960320	3967520	when we speed up when we speed up we become fearful we become panic-stricken and I think we
3967520	3977600	should stop panicking which is not to say anything about being aware of the gravity of our situation
3977600	3984560	in fact we'll be more aware of the gravity of our situation if we stop and reflect I think we
3984560	3992800	should cultivate things like gratitude which we won't do if we're rushing through life appreciating
3992800	4006080	what we have while we still have it um appreciating silence silence is like water to me it's like some
4006800	4012880	delicious nourishing liquid I can't get enough of it it's one of the reasons I live where I do
4012880	4021280	in a rather remote part of a Scottish island and when I have to go as I quite often do back into
4021280	4032480	modern urban life I'm initially overwhelmed by its its madness I'm sure there are pockets where people
4032480	4040000	can find the necessary stillness but unless they do they're going to rush headlong to their death
4040000	4046560	so they're going to push us all over that cliff faster than ever um if we have a chance to stop
4046560	4054320	it would be a very good thing to do I think we should reconnect as I say with with the natural
4054320	4061680	world spend more time there and listen to it we should pray and meditate more and that also
4061680	4071840	means listening not talking it means adapting your ear to hear what is constantly being said to you by
4073760	4080720	by the universe by what exists we have a I'm saying everything is in relationships and
4080720	4088480	those relationships are always two-way they'll always reverberate it and we drive out what we
4088480	4096160	could learn by constantly talking and so what we need to do is to cultivate mindfulness if you like
4096160	4102400	or an attitude of prayer which which is also a matter of listening not demanding anything but
4102400	4110960	trying to reflect on what one can know in relation to spiritual values particularly
4111920	4120480	um you know and and I think so a slower culture would be a great thing and when we're actually
4120480	4128240	hurtling towards the precipice why would we try and speed it up by inventing ever more sophisticated
4128240	4135600	technology that will push us faster and faster that way is technology is just a way of giving
4135600	4141280	people power and power is neither good nor bad it depends on who's wielding it and to what end
4141920	4146640	it needs wisdom and at the moment what we're doing is we're creating very powerful mechanism
4146640	4153120	we're giving them to people who haven't any of the wisdom to use them properly and so what we need
4153120	4160000	is more wisdom not more power and I'm afraid the way we're talking at the moment it's all about
4160000	4167120	increasing our power to do things this has got us into the mess and as Einstein famously said
4167120	4171760	we don't get out of the mess by the same means that got us into it we need to be starting
4172560	4179920	to simplify I think one of your your terms is the great simplification we need to simplify
4179920	4188400	our lives our goals uh what do we expect out of life and in some way sophisticated what we
4188480	4194560	feel we can give to life I have four questions in response to what you just said my first one is
4194560	4199600	what sort of megafauna and wildlife do you have on the isle of sky what's interesting there that
4199600	4209360	you periodically or rarely see um above all we have very interesting bird life there are eagles
4209360	4215200	that nest on the mountain behind my house golden eagles we also have fish eagles we have raptors
4215200	4224000	of various kinds but we also have marsh birds we have um woodland birds um in my garden you get
4224000	4232400	garden birds so we have an extraordinarily rich panoply of of bird life um there are animals
4232400	4242400	there are deer wild deer of course on the island much of the land is cultivated where it can be
4242400	4251280	or at least given over to sheep and cattle so the kind of farm animals but there are there is a
4251280	4259520	range of wildlife as you know if you try to keep chickens as I do and and sometimes that the wild
4259520	4265600	mammalian life is not necessarily on your side or not on your chicken side anyway um so there's a
4265600	4272640	lot of that and very beautiful landscape I mean it's just um a staggering mixture of of
4272640	4279600	things that I never get used to I see it and it takes my breath away yeah I I'm blessed to live
4279600	4285280	where I do on the Mississippi River um and there are lots of wild animals here and it's my biggest
4285280	4291520	joy in life is to see something like a fox when I'm on a bike ride etc so I just wanted to ask
4291520	4301520	you that so um you talked about us uh slower culture um I agree with that um but how would
4301520	4309280	that come about it's certainly not from any top down regulations or laws or rules it almost has to
4309280	4317840	come out about from from individual humans realizing this starting to listen more starting
4317840	4326160	to focus on relationships and maybe that expands outward to a critical mass do you have any speculation
4326160	4332480	on that well I think you're exactly right that it must start with individual people but that
4332480	4340320	sounds like a very tall order when we've got to make things make things happen you know yes we're
4340320	4345440	in a crisis but we won't be so effective if we think we need to rush to make things happen
4346400	4356160	if only three percent of the population saw the kind of vision of the world the kind of
4356160	4365600	meaning in the world that I hope to unveil to readers we would automatically move not by top
4365600	4374480	down control but by an inner desire we would be led to things that I can't now specify what they
4374560	4378720	will be because they will be different from every person that is the wonderful thing about it
4378720	4383680	of something that is generated from within and goes outwards rather than something that is a
4383680	4391040	straight jacket that comes down from above and I think there's something to be said for relaxing
4391040	4399520	some of the controls because we need to learn how to discipline ourselves um the culture of
4399520	4406320	particularly my grandparents and and of my parents was so very much more one of
4408000	4415200	self-discipline and selflessness than the culture that I now inhabit and it meant that a lot of
4415200	4420160	things didn't have to be policed or ruled or legislated about in the way that they are now
4420160	4423600	of course it wasn't a perfect world I'm certainly not suggesting that for a minute
4424560	4428880	and you know in the background all sorts of things were undoubtedly going on
4428880	4437600	but the fact is that we've become morally like somebody who's decided for no very good reason
4437600	4442800	that they need a wheelchair and after they've been in the wheelchair for quite a long time
4444400	4448080	they would be much better off without the wheelchair but they can't now stand without
4448080	4454080	that wheelchair and we're like that morally speaking we need all these props and supports to
4454080	4460000	keep us on the right line but if we're to survive we need to get back to a place in which we re
4460720	4467200	integrate into our personality and into our sense of ourselves some sense of what is now
4467200	4473840	seems so old-fashioned like being a decent person like being you know an honorable person
4474400	4480720	but being magnanimous by being generous by being faithful all these things that you know we now
4480720	4486000	think we're far cleverer than that that's the kind of stuff for stupid people who don't really know
4486000	4493520	how to win we're gonna win and of course that attitude has destroyed a society that was actually
4493520	4501200	working relatively well so I think we've got to get back there the bad news is that I don't think
4501200	4511280	that's going to happen until some sort of catastrophe has happened which will insist on it that we
4511280	4517360	learn again how to look after one another in small groups to trust one another to work together to
4517360	4525120	have much simpler ambitions and and demands on the planet to be able to grow our own food
4525120	4529600	to relearn skills that our ancestors had but we thought we didn't need could we got machines
4530240	4538000	and generally I think you know people say well you know what's going to happen will life die out
4538000	4543520	I don't see any evidence that life will die out I think our way of life as it now is must die out
4543520	4551200	it can't go on and I think that a lot of humans sadly will not survive but I think that humanity
4552000	4560000	will probably survive and will be the better for it we need we're so badly adrift now that
4560000	4568480	we need something that will you know inspire us to re-embrace our deeper humanity that's
4569280	4576320	really what I'm saying well it's no wonder that you like Patrick Ophel's writing he says
4576320	4582800	very similar things and and I say very similar things you're inspiring to me this conversation
4582800	4591280	is inspiring what we're trying to do is change the initial conditions of that catastrophe or that
4591280	4599280	moment in the future so that there's a wider array of positive or more benign outcomes that happen
4600000	4606800	one of the other constraints that I that I see is there are people listening to this and nodding
4606800	4614000	their heads and saying this makes sense I want to move my life in this direction a little bit
4614000	4622480	I want to be one of those 3% but then a few hours later Candy Crush and their little social media
4622480	4629840	feeds and the things on their phone and in our our pal mel smorgasbord tech culture
4631440	4638160	virtual world shouts louder to our brains than the reality that you are describing so we get
4638160	4644800	pulled back into that vortex do you have recommendations for for people on how to how
4644800	4652640	to push that aside or how to inhibit that um that craving a little bit towards this longer
4652640	4659600	term path well I think as usual it's a matter of finding a balance but a balance that is very far
4659600	4668240	from where we are now so I think that my advice would be drastically to reduce any use of social
4668240	4675600	media whatever I don't actually use it myself at all and somebody does my publicity for me so
4675600	4682640	that's nice I can it's kind of if you like a hypocrisy for me that you know I need the message
4682640	4687680	to get out there but I don't want to be on social media however I work hard at putting the measure
4687680	4693920	out the message out there by doing things like exactly what we are doing now and some of my friends
4693920	4700080	say they can't go anywhere on the internet without bumping into me so you can't please everybody
4700080	4708720	anyway um I think grossly limiting all eliminating all together eliminating social media would be a
4708720	4717600	very good thing um perhaps limiting how much and in what way you use the internet um trying not to
4717600	4726240	fuel despair but instead to think of ways in which you can increase love and the embrace of things
4726240	4733440	that are beautiful and good and truthful and to eliminate resentment from your life and try instead
4733440	4740880	to to see what is good and and to listen to other people even if they say things very different from
4740880	4747680	you um one of the great calamities of the public debate at the moment is if we don't do a very
4747680	4754160	very simple thing then you know any therapist who's ever done couple therapy knows which is
4754160	4760320	you know you get one person talking and you say no no no let him talk and and you'll have your turn
4760320	4765760	in a minute and then at the end of that you turn to the other partner and say so what did you hear
4766480	4774160	your partner just say and and that's very instructive for everybody and if we did that more
4775120	4779520	we would get round misunderstanding because you say well actually that's what you heard me say but
4779520	4785920	that's not what I meant what I meant was this I see and then you've got a dialogue Gary but at the
4785920	4791760	moment we're just shouting one another down and and anybody who has a certain kind of opinion
4791760	4799120	which embraces many opinions that seem to me to be full of wisdom must be an outcast and so
4800240	4805040	it's an extraordinary situation in which the people that need to be heard can't speak
4805760	4810720	without being shouted down by those who are full of their own importance and narcissistically sure
4810720	4815520	that they are the good people who are fighting for the good only one thing I'd like to get across
4815520	4822080	is the idea of the dark side very important idea again in psychology everybody has a dark side and
4822080	4827360	there's a dark side to everything that we promote is good and there's a good side often to things
4827360	4833120	that we want to eliminate I mean there are certain things that are non-negotiable I agree and we're
4833120	4838160	better without them but usually it's complicated and there's good and bad mixed in most of the
4838160	4843040	things that we need to be thinking about here but anyway that's that that's the kind of advice
4843040	4851280	that I'd give embrace stillness embrace peace and and and love your friends and love nature and
4851280	4859600	and love life you know I I just started three weeks ago on the advice of another coach Silent
4859600	4868400	Saturdays where I turned my phone and computers off and it's been way more difficult than I would
4868400	4874320	have thought but that's a story for another day but I totally agree with everything you just said
4875360	4882560	another follow-up question to your previous thing that you mentioned AI again so is this
4882560	4889040	another thing that in our race to develop artificial intelligence are we in effect
4889040	4895280	hypercharging this left brain dynamic that you're talking about and further atrophying
4895280	4901040	the right brain's contribution and do you think second part of the question do you think
4902000	4908960	it's possible to create an AI or an AGI that does contain a balance of right and left brain
4908960	4915600	and and imbues more wisdom into the system or would that only happen after we changed
4915600	4922080	the goals of the system away from unbridled economic growth any any thoughts there well
4922080	4929600	I have a view that may be unpopular with some but is that when we talk of artificial intelligence
4929600	4935280	we're not really talking about intelligence at all we're talking about a following of certain
4935280	4944400	procedures that gives a simulacrum of intelligence but is not intelligence and and in some sense
4944800	4953040	that is important because I don't think that ever-increasing sophistication of AI
4953920	4961680	will will help us because it can never be wise it for that it would have to have a body it would
4961680	4968080	have to have emotions it would have to be a truly social being it would have to have empathy it
4968080	4974720	would have to have suffered I don't want to be consoled by an AI mechanism created by some clever
4974720	4980320	psychology that talks me through a crisis because I want to know that the person I'm talking to
4980320	4986000	is a fellow member of humanity that has suffered as I suffer and knows that I know that I'm going to
4986000	4994320	die so I think that is a dead end for what we need um what I worry it will do is make us think
4994320	5001920	that it's intelligent and give it more credence than it should get and even if that doesn't happen
5001920	5008000	what is very worrying is that we are seeing people and even talking more and more like
5008000	5014320	machines we're seeing people as machines we're becoming more like machines the language in
5014320	5021360	which we talk about human functions is now the language of AI one's data banks and uploading
5021360	5027920	things and in one's mind you know um and because we're in everyday life forced to interact with
5027920	5034320	incredibly stupid mechanisms that are on the internet I mean the people who used to ring up
5034320	5039600	to solve a problem weren't Einstein they probably had a fairly low IQ but in five minutes they could
5039600	5046320	sort out understand exactly what you wanted and get it done now you can spend not only a morning
5046320	5052240	but I've discovered trying to get one thing changed on Amazon a whole team of us have spent
5053760	5060480	nearly eight weeks trying to get it fixed and it's very simple we can we can do all this
5060480	5067600	you know clever stuff like create a robot that looks somewhat like a kind of an abortion of a
5067600	5073040	human being but nonetheless we can't do simple stuff and that has an immense impact on daily life
5073680	5079840	I know I haven't got much time left to live but an unreasonable amount of it is taken up in doing
5079840	5086000	procedural stuff that bulks now vastly greater in my life I mean I was just talking to my daughter
5086000	5090880	who is training as a psychotherapist and she's saying you know the trouble is I have to spend so
5090880	5096320	much time filling in things on the internet going on platforms doing this that and the other
5096320	5102400	crikey when I was training there was absolutely none of that so we've got ourselves into a really
5102560	5108800	stupid corner it's artificial stupidity that is taking us over we don't it's artificial so we
5108800	5115120	don't have to obey it we need to embrace our own capacity for wisdom which is in bringing together
5115120	5122320	intuition and imagination not fantasy but true imagination to get you into the heart of reality
5122320	5129440	our only chance of doing so along with science and reason so sorry that was a bit of a bit of a
5129520	5135040	splurge there but I think that you know it's important that we can't rely on AI for any of
5135040	5140320	these things and that the effort that goes into it would be much better put into things that are
5140320	5147920	quite practical that we could do so my contribution will be to no longer call it artificial intelligence
5147920	5154720	or AI but ASI artificial simulacrum intelligence there by naming the beast
5156800	5169440	so you mentioned imagination along with intuition and in one of your videos or something I read from
5169440	5179680	you how important is the need for the space to allow creativity in developing the health of an
5179680	5188560	individual do you have any stories of that and how does allowing that space contrast with the
5188560	5194240	expectations and trajectories that we currently put on our youth especially in the United States
5194320	5200880	context where young people get into debt and get addicted and distracted and all that do you have
5200880	5211920	any stories or on the importance of imagination and creating space I do indeed you know it's often
5211920	5219520	said that science was very creative in the period between say the 20s and the 60s or 70s but since
5219600	5224400	then what has mainly happened is technological refinements rather than real breakthroughs in science
5225200	5231520	and what happened during that period very often was that people worked either alone or in small
5231520	5237920	groups of perhaps two or three people but mainly something like the Rand corporation took bright
5237920	5247840	people gave them an office and a desk and a salary and said do whatever it is that you think is
5247840	5252560	important to do and you know there's a risk involved in that but one of the problems with our
5252560	5258240	cultures are so risk averse and if you there is a risk that somebody will abuse it but if you
5258240	5265520	don't take that risk then we're on to hiding to nothing because nothing will come of micro managing
5265520	5271360	people towards an outcome if you take creative people and tell them they've got to publish a paper
5271360	5276000	every few months explaining what they're doing they will never reach the point from which they can
5276080	5282880	actually see a picture that coheres now I've been fortunate in that I've gone into various things
5282880	5288720	quite deeply but I've also been able to see the big picture and one of the reasons why is that in
5288720	5294320	all my education from my teams onwards I was allowed an enormous amount of freedom I was expected
5294320	5301200	to work very hard at technical things at maths at you know at ancient languages and so on which
5301200	5306800	are not a piece of cake and that's fine that was part of my education but I was also left with an
5306800	5313120	immense amount of free time to read as I thought best and follow up things that I was being taught
5313120	5318400	and that went on through university and eventually ended in my getting a kind of fellowship which
5318400	5323440	a version of which still exists but I think they're trying to make it more left hemisphere I'm
5323440	5328080	afraid which is a fellowship a prize fellowship of all souls which you you got after sitting a
5328080	5334720	three-day exam if you were lucky and that gave me seven years and nobody insisted that I published
5334720	5340160	anything in fact I did publish a book about five years or so into the fellowship or maybe it was a
5340160	5346400	bit longer than that and at the time I wondered what I was doing because I was following many
5346400	5351200	things I followed science I went to philosophy seminars I found a teacher so that I could learn
5351200	5356240	Russian and it all kinds of things and then at the end of it I thought I needed to train in medicine
5356320	5362080	which I did and then in psychiatry and neuro psychiatry and all that so but that was because
5362080	5368320	I plowed a very unconventional furrow and the system was flexible enough to allow it I don't
5368320	5374080	think that system is any longer so flexible I think people will want somebody to account for
5374080	5379600	themselves all the time now the thing that's important to know is that great scientists and
5379600	5385760	mathematicians of whom I cite many examples in in the matter with things you usually found out
5386240	5392480	the great discoveries after a fallow period in which they really were either at a dead end
5392480	5397040	or they'd stopped thinking about it and their mind had moved on to something else and then
5397040	5405440	suddenly one day you know famously as as his foot you know landed on the bus the solution to
5405520	5413920	vaccine equations came to um oh god I forgot my own name now but anyway you never have your
5413920	5422320	primary so um this this freedom is really important and in retrospect for a long time I
5422320	5427840	wondered perhaps I wasted that time but now I know that I didn't waste it because it enabled me to
5427840	5435200	write books that are both deeply grounded in the kind of technical stuff but also you know spacious
5435280	5442320	enough to bring together psychology history anthropology you know with art and Persian
5442320	5448320	music and and so on and you know some people think that well that must mean that they don't
5448320	5453040	want to read it and they can't be any good because how can anybody you know seriously know anything
5453040	5458480	about all those things but fine I don't speaking to them I'm speaking to people who want to know
5458480	5465520	something that's come from you know having a lot of free time to think it's not really free
5465520	5472480	in the sense of pointless or you know it's free in the sense that I can be the decider as to what I
5472480	5483440	do so in a way though that's one linkage between your story and mine is the energy surplus of the
5483440	5492880	industrial revolution and late 20th century enabled someone like you to have the creativity in the
5492880	5501360	space to lay the foundations of writing two well three really because your last book is in two pieces
5502000	5508560	tomes on the human condition and the human brain which is kind of a product of energy surplus which
5508560	5516480	isn't going to be with us for long so this this is it this is our our species level moment to know
5517200	5523200	where to potentially know where we came from how we got here what we're doing what we really need
5523200	5531920	what the impacts are what is open to us in the future and it's it's both unbelievably tragic
5531920	5538240	and stunningly beautiful and profound at the same time you call it energy surplus which is very
5538240	5546240	much a way of thinking about it I understand that but what I would call it is a sophisticated
5546240	5557600	civilization the legacy of the Renaissance the Enlightenment Victorian hard work and that the
5557600	5566320	kind of institutions of now that are now busily trying to destroy their excellence that can provide
5566320	5573520	that um had it if you like you can call all civilization to do with a kind of energy surplus
5573520	5579440	that you know that was true in the Renaissance and so forth I understand that but it wasn't
5579440	5584320	to do with energy surplus in the sense that we mean since the industrial revolution it had very
5584320	5589680	little to do with that the kind of work I was encouraged to do and the kind of conversations I
5589680	5595680	was encouraged to have apart from the fact that they included up-to-date science were very much the
5595680	5603680	sort of continuation of a tradition of scholarship really and and we seem to have turned our backs
5603680	5610080	on that except in some rather wonderful places where people are now starting up colleges that
5610080	5617760	really are serious about learning in a broad sense and and and you know not just passing on
5617760	5623600	propaganda but actually enabling people to think freely and in a balanced way about the predicament
5623600	5628720	we find ourselves in so that's a good sign there are good signs I mean one of the things that really
5628720	5633280	encourages me is the number of young people who write to me often scientists and say this stuff
5633280	5638640	that you're writing is so fantastic and I'm starting to do a project on this and can you
5638640	5644400	advise and so on which usually I can't but nonetheless the enthusiasm for it is extremely
5645520	5651040	important to me and gives me hope for the future I I agree with that I get I get similar
5651600	5658160	feedback all the time I want to be respectful of your time but I do have some some closing
5658160	5663280	questions that I ask all my viewers but before that a building on what you just said
5665840	5672800	how would you in a perfect world redesign the education system if if you were in charge
5673520	5680240	so that you would take into account a lot of the the wisdom and and the science that you've
5680240	5689440	discovered over decades towards better preparing young human beings towards the future of the 21st
5689440	5697920	century to be you know left brain right brain more balanced to be slower to spend time in nature
5697920	5703200	to meditate what would you do to change the education system because in my view the education
5703200	5712000	system itself has become a out of control super organism that feeds on its own demands etc well
5712000	5722240	in in in short I'd re humanize it and the emphasis only on stem subjects is a product of this
5724320	5731600	feeling that we need to increase productivity but that will get us nowhere on its own we desperately
5731600	5740720	need to have intelligent knowledgeable human beings who who are aware of the culture that to
5740720	5748400	which they owe so much and are not taking a sledgehammer to it and and so I would reintroduce
5748400	5757440	the humanities including some emphasis on on music on drama on poetry and on philosophy in the sense
5757520	5762240	that there are different ways in history of thinking about things and to see some of them
5762240	5767440	you'll think like this and to see others you'd think like that and thus broadening people's
5767440	5773440	horizons and seeing that there are you know there are often many sides to any one question I think
5773440	5780000	that would be a very important thing I think that young people should be taught mindfulness
5780000	5789040	in school from an early age I think the whole rhetoric of mechanistic determinism should not
5789040	5795360	be the assumed model for the cosmos and that really means introducing I don't know how it
5795360	5803200	would best be done but something of spirituality again into the into the curriculum the exact
5803200	5809680	thousand wherefores are not for me to stay but I think that that would be good I also think that
5809680	5817360	emphasis on the being right answers in exams rather than demonstrating intelligent thinking
5818720	5827120	you know that that should be played down you know there are ways in which you can be wrong
5827120	5832640	but have given a fantastically interesting answer to a question whereas somebody else who just
5833760	5837840	you know follows everyone else and says the right thing may have been very
5837840	5842880	unintelligent in their response so I that's the way I'd look at it we need to be freer we need to
5842880	5848400	trust we need to trust teachers for god's sake we need to trust university lectures we need to
5848400	5854160	trust doctors we need to you know we we shouldn't be telling them all the time how to do that
5854160	5859520	let's managerialize out of existence I mean who'd want to be a teacher now who'd want to be a doctor
5860320	5866640	you know it is a reality that started in the in the in the 80s that managers started to tell
5866640	5871360	doctors how to do their job well and and there are more of them now than the doctors and they're
5871360	5876720	better paid than the doctors and their culture is a nonsense because it you know it's not the
5876720	5881680	culture that you work extremely hard to have the experience and knowledge of a doctor can be and
5881680	5886720	the same is true of a teacher a teacher makes a gift of a relationship with a child the people
5886720	5891760	who really taught me anything we're on fire with the thing is that it that inspired them and they
5891760	5896080	communicated that spark to me and it might not have been on the curriculum but I will remember
5896080	5902960	it all my life we've turned the planet into a business as a species and I agree with you regarding
5902960	5909520	teaching I may have no money at all but it was the most rewarding thing I've ever done with these
5909520	5919440	17 18 19 year olds um yeah ancient wisdom from my understanding in India have long known about the
5919440	5928960	brain hemispheres just a penultimate question here from a western medical and psychological
5928960	5935520	perspective are there specific practices recommended for rebalancing the hemispheres you
5935520	5943360	mentioned a few of them earlier but could the wisdom of the eastern religions you mentioned
5943360	5949280	Taoism Buddhism be integrated with the modern imbalance of the west and how would that come
5949280	5955440	about well absolutely the people just need to acquaint themselves with this and at school I
5955440	5961040	got to know Heraclitus and I thought he was far more interesting than Plato and then about 20 I
5961040	5968080	read Alan Watts's Tao the watercourse way and that reconnected me with the pre-socratic philosophers
5968080	5975360	like Heraclitus and it was another you know life-changing moment when I read that book and
5975360	5981600	since then Taoism has always been part of my thinking so people people can start by picking up books
5981600	5989120	but it's not about reading a book it's like you can't learn to swim by reading a book about it you
5989120	5996640	need to get in the water and do it and you can't actually experience what people mean by religious
5997440	6002720	religious life by simply reading about it you have to start committing yourself to something
6003680	6010160	so that's a very important insight on how this sort of thing works but what I would say is that
6010160	6016800	I've mentioned already things like mindfulness which is almost the clearest example I can give
6016800	6024480	of recruiting the right hemisphere and trying to silence the ever chattering ever judgmental
6025040	6032800	left hemisphere and allowing things as Heidegger says to presence before us rather than simply be
6032800	6039680	represented in our minds so that's a good thing and the arts in general as I say but also leading a
6039680	6045440	certain kind of life and the ambition to lead that life being put into children at school
6045440	6051040	and it's not a fix it's not something they can get tomorrow but they need to begin to start the
6051040	6056640	steps on a journey that will be a lifelong journey that will take them ever deeper into a
6056640	6063040	country they need to know and where they belong so it's about it's about changing the way we
6063040	6066640	think about everything's got to be a quick fix and there's got to be an answer and a test to
6066640	6070720	make sure people have got it and all that but that is really beside what I'm talking about
6071600	6080800	I just want to say can I say add this that it's not just it's not just the eastern religions that
6080800	6085760	seem to show an understanding of the relationship between the hemispheres and I quote you know the
6085760	6091280	Daodu Jing and and I quote the Yi Qing and all these things in the book because they have
6091280	6095440	extraordinary insights into the relationship between the hemispheres as soon as you know about
6096080	6101920	you can see that they intuited this without having brain scanners but the most remarkable
6102560	6109520	example is a story by the Onondaga people who are part of the Iroquois nation and I tell it at
6110240	6115360	you know some length it's the first six pages of part three of the book it's absolutely staggering
6115360	6120480	I can't tell it now but these people intuited exactly the relationship between the hemispheres
6120480	6126000	and what was going to happen when the the brother as they call the two brothers with one brother who
6126000	6130880	doesn't know as much as the other when that brother starts to take control so I mean they saw they
6130880	6138080	foresaw all of this anyway sorry that was just an addendum to my answer homo sapiens clever but
6138080	6146880	seldom wise um so you've you've talked about culture and you've talked about from the perspective
6146880	6154320	of education system but what about young humans specifically do you have any recommendations
6154320	6162880	for 18 to 25 year old human beings around the world who are aware of climate change and resource
6162880	6168720	depletion and polarization in our economy and the constraints to the human enterprise that are
6168720	6173920	listening to this and nodding their heads agreeing with the wisdom that you're sharing what what
6173920	6182240	advice do you have for young humans not to be afraid to trust their intuitions but to question them
6183440	6188080	as you question everything everything you're told without necessarily that leading to your
6188080	6197440	dismissing it but just making sure that you've seen both sides of everything um taking strength from
6198160	6206640	a spiritual tradition knowing the works in it belonging to it nourishing your soul at
6208240	6217920	the fount of art and music dedicating yourself to practical good works either locally or as part
6217920	6223600	of an organization that you admire as long as you still are in it and continue to admire it
6224560	6230560	there can come a time when you may decide it happens so often in institutions as it's become
6230560	6237840	more of a barrier to achieving its original aim than it is promoting it as William James said
6237840	6252160	already in the 19th century um uh not necessarily believing everything that experts tell you but
6252240	6257440	at least while you're young thinking it's quite a good idea to listen to what experts say about this
6258480	6268080	um with time you may see what you can you know what of that that quote wisdom was really wisdom
6268080	6276240	and what wasn't and and act appropriately believe in the power of humanity to surprise us
6276560	6286960	you know there was homo habilis and there is homo sapiens clever homo wise homo and you know
6287600	6294480	we are supposed to do that homo sapiens but we have it in us to be wise in a way that no other
6294480	6303840	creature can be wise that wisdom is the product of hard work long self-discipline and immersion
6303840	6313120	in the glorious business of life and it lies the other side of knowledge so there's ignorance on
6313120	6319120	one side of knowledge and there's a kind of unknowing which is wise on the other side and it has
6319120	6326320	nothing to do with ignorance it's where you are in the position to be wise and so all of these
6326320	6331920	things are part of a long narrative that may be frustrating to a young person who wants
6331920	6339200	wisdom now but wisdom cannot be had now but you won't get it unless you make the investments in it
6339200	6345600	now so the start of life is making investments in becoming a certain kind of person over time
6346800	6352400	and society should encourage those steps and not say the only way forward for you is to work in some
6352400	6362320	vast organization in which you have no no say no no ability to use your own initiative I think we
6362320	6368720	should you know look at it organizations and a healthy one is one in which as far as possible
6368720	6374000	initiative and freedom to act are passed down the tree there's got to be some upper control I
6374000	6379360	understand that but as far as possible to let people manage intelligently what they're dealing with
6379360	6385840	and be answerable for it and be dismissed if they've done a bad job but to take part in a life which
6385840	6392400	is not just being embedded in the kind of organizations that now so many people will end up going into
6393440	6397920	and and you know dare to be different but it's going to be hard work you know I dared to be
6397920	6402240	different I gave up a promising academic career in order to start being a medical student when I
6402240	6407360	was in my early 30s and already had a couple of children under the age of three so I didn't know
6407360	6412160	whether I was more insomniac when I was working 120 hours a week in the hospital which in those days
6412160	6420400	was legal it isn't now or at home so you know you live dangerously I've lived dangerously but you
6420400	6426320	also need to work very very hard but if you can be prepared to work hard be honest to yourself be
6426320	6434560	honorable to yourself and to others to be to be you know inspired by by some goal that seems you
6435360	6443600	real and valuable that is a loving goal not just a selfish goal then go for it go for it and you
6443600	6449840	know may god be with you that's all I can say and I hope you will because you know the future depends
6449840	6457040	on people like you doing that I always dared to be different but I'm in my mid 50s right now and
6457440	6465040	I'm firstly now investing in the things that will bring me wisdom and I wish I had started that 30
6465040	6474480	years ago when I was in my 20s I was I was much more left-brained yeah no I believe that what
6474480	6481680	do you care most about in the world Ian? It's a very difficult thing to to say because I
6482640	6488240	I just care about the world really you know but I care about it under the aspect of love
6490720	6498240	I care about real love continuing and prospering and spreading
6500320	6506320	I can't say better than that that's ultimately what life's about you can do anything you can be
6506320	6513920	anything but if you don't experience love and you don't do in your own way what seems to you
6513920	6521360	to be the loving thing then I'm not sure what point life has I'm sounding a bit like some fool here
6521360	6527280	never a man I particularly have found on my wavelength but there we are but I'm sure he was
6527280	6536080	very wise and right about many things. Is love a product of both the left and right hemispheres?
6537040	6540320	It's much bigger than either hemisphere it comes from somewhere very deep
6541360	6546640	below the hemispheres I believe and it takes the whole body and it takes the whole of the
6546640	6554960	embodied being their heart their gut literally and their brain their soul their spirit their
6554960	6568880	intelligence their everything. If you could wave a magic wand even though we know those don't exist
6568880	6576240	and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one thing one thing that you would do to
6576240	6586720	improve human and planetary futures? It is again almost impossible to say
6591280	6596240	and one of the reasons this is of course it can't happen and one's constrained by what can happen but
6596240	6612720	I think bringing back into our lives that those things that I talked about of humility and and
6612720	6620560	or if people could be made to experience those things on the daily basis if scientists could
6620560	6627280	realize that they don't know so very much it's wonderful that they know what they know and that
6627280	6634160	I'm with them every inch of the way in the work that it's done but that really as William James said
6635600	6643280	ignorance is an ocean what we know is just a drop and that you know that that's how we are and if
6644000	6650960	if we had that sense before the world and we had the sense of awe and wonder in it we would behave
6650960	6657040	well to it and to one another in that aspect of love that I've described that's all I can say.
6657920	6666000	So are you still writing is this going to be a trilogy maybe the last book will be how the
6666080	6679040	emissary relinquished the things? I won't be doing any more big books I don't have the energy
6679040	6684880	all the time but I might write a few short books I've just been reminded yesterday by Oxford
6684880	6690640	University Press that I promised them a book many years ago which would be a kind of intellectual
6690720	6699520	autobiography I hope a short one I'd quite like to write a short book of things I'd like to say to
6700560	6706880	my younger self or to people who are growing now about the world and it will have no footnotes
6706880	6712640	and no bibliography and it will be no more than a hundred pages probably much less
6713680	6717440	and the other thing I've promised for a long time to write and I would very much enjoy is a
6717440	6724480	book on the art created by psychotic subjects I've collected some from patients of mine I
6725280	6730880	was fortunate enough to work at the Bethlehem Royal Hospital the most ancient mental hospital in the
6730880	6737200	world founded in the late 14th century and it has a magnificent museum of works done by
6737200	6744240	some of its patients some of them quite well known and I've always found it utterly fascinating
6744240	6748240	and I'd like to write a relatively short monograph illustrated with some of these works
6749600	6756000	because I think people would find it intriguing as I do this has been a great conversation
6756000	6762400	it's been inspiring to me and I'm glad that we met after all this time and and hope we can
6762400	6768160	continue a conversation thank you for your lifetime of work and and for your time today
6768160	6776960	Dr. Ian McElchrist thank you very much Nate and I too have found it thoroughly enjoyable talking
