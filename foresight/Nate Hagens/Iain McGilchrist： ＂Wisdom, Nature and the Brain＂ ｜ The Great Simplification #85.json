{"text": " I would like to warmly welcome my next guest, Ian McGilchrist. Ian is a psychiatrist, a neuroscience researcher, an author, a philosopher, a literary scholar. He is an associate, a fellow of the Green Templeton College, Oxford, a fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a consultant emeritus of the Bethlehem and Maudsley Hospital in London. Professor McGilchrist came into prominence with the publication of his tome, The Master and His Emissary, The Divided Brain, and The Making of the Western World, which is how I came to be exposed to his work. And then 14 years later, his most recent book titled The Matter with Things, Our Brains, Our Delusions, and The Unmaking of the World. This was one of those conversations that was both profound, wise, and intimate. I had never met or spoken with Ian before the camera was turned on, and I learned continually during this podcast, and I immediately felt a kinship with this man who deeply cares about the state of the world and has spent a lifetime researching what I think is the most important aspect of our situation, which is the human brain and our disconnect from the types of experience and perspectives of our ancestors. I hope you enjoy this episode as much as I did. Please welcome Dr. Ian McGilchrist. Dr. Ian McGilchrist, good to meet you, sir. Very good to be with you, Nate. Thank you for asking me along. I've been making it a habit when I say hello to people in other countries that I greet them in their language, but since you're in Scotland, I didn't know if I should just start swearing or how to greet someone in Scottish. Any kind of suitable animal noise that suggests some appreciation will do. Let me bring you up to speed here. Some things you might not know. 20 years ago, I started my PhD. I left Wall Street because I could see how the pieces were starting to connect and that humans were having a real problem with climate change, the environment, resources, et cetera. I started my PhD with a British psychiatrist on my advisory committee by the name of Dr. Peter Weibrow. We were going to look at why we don't so much face an environmental problem or a resource problem, but a mismatch of the human brain with our current situation. Then I ended up diving into energy and I left that aside, but reading your books and, to be honest, I've had them for two months and I've not made my way through them. I called Daniel Schmacktenberger and said, I'm interviewing Ian McGillchrist next week. Could you leave me some pointers? He left me a 19-minute boxer that I would need a librarian to translate, but it seems that all along you have been talking about the same thing, which is that our brains are driving much of what's going on. I don't want to rehash what you've done on lots of other excellent podcasts and videos and you sent me that animated video, which I think is great. I want to apply it to this superorganism environmental dynamic, but for those people who are not familiar with your work, could you give kind of an elevator pitch but a longish one on the core points in your two main books, The Master and his Emissary and The Matter With Things, if you would? Yes, I can do that. I think the first thing that I would point out is I don't believe that the brain is driving these things in some sort of way. I believe that there are many causes of the crisis that we're in now, some of them economic, some of them political, some of them sociological and it has many aspects. So I'm not saying it's the brain that causes the crisis we're in, but the brain has become hijacked in a way by the way we're thinking now and that that's important for us to realise. So in those books, essentially they start from a few interesting questions which puzzle me a lot and we're not talked about in my medical training. Why is the brain divided at all? If it's this supercomputer, why waste computing power by dividing it into two chunks in this way? I don't believe it is a computer by the way. I can tell you a half a dozen reasons why it's not like a computer, but nonetheless, why is it divided? Why is it asymmetrical? And why for most of the history of the brain has there been no band of fibres connecting them? It was a mammalian invention, the corpus callosum, it's called the body of fibres at the base of the brain that connects the two hemispheres. But the divided brain goes back millions of years, hundreds of millions of years and the asymmetry of the brain goes back to the very earliest neural networks. Why? And the answer to this is simple in a way, at least I think and nobody's suggested anything that goes near it and explaining why we have this arrangement and nobody suggested I'm wrong to say this. It stems from a Darwinian problem of survival. How do you pay narrow attention to something that you need to manipulate to something you need to pick up if you're a bird get that seed quickly, if you're a predator to catch your prey, if you want to pick up sticks or fashion tools, you've got to have this very manipulative cast of mind in which you're going to target that whatever it is that you know is important to you in detail. And that requires a very focused narrow beam attention. If that's the only kind of attention you pay, then you will end up being someone else's lunch while you're getting your own because you need to be on the lookout for predators. You need to be on the lookout for your conspecifics, for your mate, for your offspring that also need to be protected and fed. So the only way in which you can pay these two kinds of attention at once is to have two neuronal masses each capable of disposing a kind of attention to the world. One narrow targeted piecemeal, the other uncommitted, broad, sustained and vigilant. Now that may not sound like a big deal, but the fact that there's a different way of attending changes everything because how you attend governs what you find. And so effectively these two ways of attending to the world build completely different images takes whatever you like to call them of the world in our minds. I hesitate over image because it makes it sound it's just visual, but I mean in every modality. And what are those differences? Well, there are about a dozen of them that are isolable. But let me just say this, in the left hemisphere the world seems to be made up of little bits that have no context, no meaning, they're isolated, atomistic, and if they have any meaning at all it's because we put them together in some way for some purpose of our own. They're abstracted from their embodied nature, from their physical context, relatively devoid of any kind of meaning including emotional, spiritual meaning. And what you have there is a pretty much an inanimate and mechanical world, a dead world. The right hemisphere on the other hand sees the broad picture and it sees that everything is ultimately connected with everything else. That unlike these fixed frames of the left hemisphere everything can be seen to be in constant movement, nothing ever stops moving in the entire universe. It sees that everything is what it is only in the context that it's in. So once you've isolated it you've lost most of its meaning. It sees that, for example, the animals and the people that we see around us are embodied and that's a very important part of their nature. It sees that the inner life, it sees what is implicit whereas the left hemisphere sees only the explicit. As a result the left hemisphere doesn't understand things like tone of voice, facial expressions, bodily gestures, puns, metaphors, myths, narratives, rites, rituals, anything that isn't just the kind of thing you could teach a machine by putting in a word box and a kind of syntax box it doesn't really get. And it's also super confident that it's right. In fact because it knows so very little it thinks it knows everything. There's something in psychology I'm sure you know called the Dunning-Kruger effect which dictates that the less you know the more you think you know and the right hemisphere however sees a great deal and has arranged things so that it can farm out the mere procedural work to the left hemisphere so that it doesn't get distracted from its job of seeing the overall picture. So these two work very well in harmony as long as the left hemisphere observes its role as an adjunct to the right hemisphere. It sees less but it can do certain things very quickly in the way that a PC can. I mean the PC doesn't know what you know you put data in it doesn't understand them it spews stuff out it doesn't understand it you do the understanding the PC just does it quickly and the left hemisphere is like as I say I resist the idea that the brain is a computer but just for this purpose of this metaphor the left hemisphere is like the personal PC of the right hemisphere that is the one that we can trust because it's more in touch with reality in every respect. And so in I expound that to begin with in the master and his emissary and I do it at greater length in the first part of the matter with things. In the second part of the master and his emissary I say how has this changed if it has changed over the course of western civilization because I see that around us we seem to be very much living in a world of the kind that the left hemisphere sees unsophisticated untempered by what the right hemisphere could teach us. So has it always been like this and my answer to that is no over the history of the west there have been three points at which civilization seemed to embody the best of the two working together fruitfully. And I'd say these moments are around the sixth century BC in ancient Greece around the year dot in Rome and around the 1415 century the beginning of the Renaissance in Europe. And at those moments we see something flourishing in the arts in the sciences everywhere because these hemispheres are feeding one another but in every case after a period of time things seem to fossilize they become more mechanical more hierarchical more stereotype more bureaucratic more legalistic and the imaginative part that helps us see and understand the world we live in begins to erode and the civilization collapses it collapsed in Greece it collapsed in Rome and it's collapsing for us now I believe. In the matter with things I do a little bit more and I look more at the philosophical implications of this so I look at the way what neurology can teach us about the hemispheres what philosophy can teach us about the hemispheres and what physics can tell us about the world that we live in and I find that these three parts lead from different very different starting points to the same picture of the world which is very close to the one the right hemisphere has of something that is never fixed and certain that is always evolving that is in process that is complex beautiful rich interconnected animate rather than the dead world of mechanistic reductionism so that's it in a nutshell there's a lot more to say but you can ask me if you're interested. I am interested and I've got like 14 prepared questions for you and I think I'm just going to scrap those and ask you whatever comes to my mind because I have a ton of questions so the left brain puts the bits together and creates a narrative that suits us right so it uses the left brain in kind of a internal authority bias sort of way and dominates the narrative which could explain why there's so many people that are cocksure that they understand the world and trump is right or biden is right or you know climate change is a hoax or we're all going extinct that it gives people like a overly self-confident because it helps themselves in their own fitness. I think the left hemisphere envisages only the sort of thing it can know and it knows how to put things together and make something and so it decides that the world must be made like that from little bit and in doing so it completely misunderstands its nature and it produces that kind of cocksure certainty which is surely the sign of a lack of wisdom one of the signs of wisdom is that one feels less certain that one knows rather than more certain that one knows in general so yeah I do think that yeah. Did you ever have a chance to watch uh we were emailing a couple months back the the latest episode with Daniel Schmockenberger and I on artificial intelligence where we really it was only a little bit on AI it was mostly about how humans have had narrow boundary criteria nation states economic systems have outcompeted wide boundary more wisdom types of systems. Did you ever listen to that and what do you think about that? Intelligence versus wisdom is a little bit of a narrow boundary goal versus a wide boundary goal. I did listen to part of it but I didn't listen to all of it and I'm very interested in Daniel's work and he and I are going to do a couple of things together but what I'd say about that is that first of all human beings are not just the squalid competitive apes that we are made out to be we have many many interesting traits we are social animals we know how to sacrifice for another and indeed the history of evolution is as much a history of cooperation as it is of competition competition is very important of course but the cooperation has been neglected and we do know how to cooperate and when we're working well both the hemisphere cooperate with one another and we cooperate with one another so the history I mean the history of the west is the one that I know best I haven't attempted to write about the history of the east though I suspect it will tell a different story until very recently when it seems to become occidentalized in the most lamentable way taking all our worst sins upon it but anyway and yeah I mean I think that is right wisdom is always going to be relatively rare and involves a lot of things it involves the putting together of a life well lived and the experience that comes from that with an understanding of history a sense of the spiritual and an ability to aggregate information but at the moment I'd say that information is triumphant over a true understanding and an understanding is what intelligence requires and means so that much of the time we're amassing information and we kind of know in a technical way certain things we probably know more in that sense than than humanity has ever known but we're also in my view less wise than humanity has ever been this fact that we can know things and can do things has gone to our heads and made us hubristic vain and ridiculous because we think we can solve everything but we don't understand a half of what we've got hold of here so I think AI is a problem yeah so how how does that map from an individual to a culture because as individuals we have left hemispheres and right hemispheres and we have a corpus callosum that divides them and is getting larger over time implying that there's some narrative control going on but our culture doesn't have a left or a right hemisphere so is it just the proportion of the population that is kind of tilted in one direction that periodically you said there were a couple historical cultures that flourished because they had more of a balanced what's the difference between individuals population and the whole culture with respect to this phenomenon yes it's a reasonable question and of course I'm not suggesting that physically the brain has changed enormously since 2000 years ago it will have changed a bit because it's always involving but it's not that I'm referring to and it's that we use the brain in in different ways we can choose to listen to one part of the brain more than another and I think that what happens it as a society becomes a powerful civilization a number of things happen one is that it over reaches itself either in terms of its territory or its military and economic power and in doing that it needs to be able to control or thinks it needs to be able to control a vast ever vast panoply of of elements in human life and to do that it needs to simplify to roll out as we say a bureaucratic system and so forth so as a civilization becomes too large and over reaches itself it moves more and more towards a kind of left hemisphere thinking that helps it with the map the theory the diagram of life rather than the actual business of life and I think the other thing that happens well there are many things that happened I think there are about half a dozen that I refer to in the preface to the matter with things um sorry the preface to the martian is emissary and take much further in the matter with things but one is something that the great philosopher A. N. Whitehead said that a civilization thrives until it over analyzes itself and I think that what's happening in our world is we're we don't really live connected so much to nature we don't live connected to a spiritual tradition we don't live connected to our history and culture we our art has become too intellectualized it's become too conceptual not powerful visceral and metaphoric in its nature as most great art is and so we've been cut loose and we're all kind of at a loss and when we try to talk to one another across these spaces we tend to talk in very theoretical terms so people talk about a theory of politics a theory of economics and a theory of how people behave and so usually this is inaccurate over simple and so it's that that gets us into this frame of mind because the left hemisphere's message is money for old road it's incredibly simple we're just apes that compete for territory money and power that's the left hemisphere's knowledge because let me put it this way the left hemisphere's resolve debt is to make us powerful to help us grab things it controls the right hand which from most of us is the one which we do the grabbing and the manipulating and it helps us maintain power but all the rest of the understanding of everything else that humans are capable of the life of the spirit the life of of of morality of beauty of goodness of truth all these things are somehow left out of this picture and become somehow marginalized or trivialized as they have done I believe in our culture at the moment and so why I wrote the matter with things was because I could see that we all agree there is something that is the matter with things I mean very few people think everything's going fine right now but it's also a notice of the fact that we overvalue matter in the most simple sense I actually say that materialists are not people who overvalue matter they're people who undervalue matter because matter is a very extraordinary thing matter is wonderful but this kind of simple idea of matter is what we we tend to overestimate the power of the consciousness and the spirit the mind is is somehow a secondary secretion of matter which it cannot be and that we've made a world up out of things which is how the left hand is here puts things together whereas I believe the importance in in everything lies in relationship not in what we call the things themselves that are related So many thoughts Ian let me let me go off on a tangent here I would say that historically the animus religions would probably have a better balance between the left and the right hemispheres and the story that I've put together with the energy hungry emergent cultural super organism kind of started with the agricultural revolution 10 to 12,000 years ago which was in many ways a fall from grace because we were living close to limits but we were living with the right brain appreciation of the relationships with ourselves with our surroundings with nature with other species is it possible that as the population expanded and then exploded that our world is so full of things and stories about the things and advertising about the things that the left brain has no choice but to intercede and take over I'm just speculating what do you what do you think about all that Well I think it's very tempting for the left hemisphere to think that it's going to understand these things but that is part of the problem I think you're right about animistic cultures I'm not saying that animism is you know the answer to philosophy not in the least but I think it's a way of understanding something that's very important which is the relationship of life to the world at large including things that are in our purview that we wouldn't normally call animate in fact if you suppress the left hemisphere which you can do experimentally people see things that we would call inanimate sometimes as animate and if you do the opposite and suppress the right hemisphere they begin to see even people and animals as like machines or pieces of furniture so I think animism is an expression of a kind of vision that we could learn from but I think subsequent philosophy has gone much further in that and I don't know if we want to go there but I hold a view called panentheism which is that God is in everything and everything is in God and I think that in fact the great loss in our time is of any spiritual or moral compass any sense of our groundedness in a cosmos that is beautiful has a direction to it and has meaning in it I mean we're taught that we just paint these things on the walls of ourselves to cheer ourselves up that we invent meaning and values and purpose I don't believe this at all in fact the long book the matter with things is demonstrating exactly how wrong that is and that in fact we don't invent them but we discover them we literally find them or fail to find them depending on who we are is it possible that eight billion well look before I ask that you just said you can suppress the left hemisphere experimentally is that like in a medical situation or can you are there some parlor tricks you can do at home because that might be a good thing if we all did those experiments as they used to say in those films don't attempt this at home okay okay yeah um I'm talking about um I'm talking effectively about something called transcranial magnetic stimulation which is a a process that will be done in a in a hospital setting or at least in a in a yes in a clinical setting Ian let me tell you a story let me tell you a story three years ago I was chainsawing on my property here and I had to crawl under the horse fence to get to the tree and it's electrified and the electrical fence hit me squarely on the top of my head and it hurt so badly for five seconds for the next five hours I was in this like zen state where I felt connected to everything I didn't have like a compulsion to check my phone it was weird and I just always wondered if that was like a miniature version of what you're describing but it's a wonderful story thank you I wouldn't like to say really really but I mean of course just in case anybody's listening who who knows somebody or has ECT it it's done with an anaesthetic now and you're not aware of it so it's all fine but okay in any case yet passing electric current through the brain surely does make some changes um yeah where were we we were talking about yeah you can isolate one at a time but not you know not to try it at home yeah and and you asked me that question probably for some reason is there a test that you could give people other than walking into a cocktail party and talking to someone for five year five minutes and realizing that they're pretty much left brain dominant but is there is there a test like a psychological test that can see where people are on on behaviorally on this spectrum or is it not that refined no I mean there are some terrible things on the internet that tell you whether you're left or right brain but just forget that forget most of everything that's on the internet unless it comes from me on this topic because it's going to repeat the awful old the awful old canards about about the the two hemispheres but no there are proper neuropsychological instruments as we call them that can be administered questionnaires and can score people but again largely these things were generated before the huge body of work that I have done and is the 2000 pages or more of these two books together which really has completely changed the landscape on hemisphere difference most of the things that people used to say are wrong and there are one or two things that are broadly right but so it is important and you can tell yes but I mean especially for psychiatrists you can you can tell fairly quickly if somebody's autistic and autism is a condition which has different manifestations I think there are autism rather than one simple autism but the communist form of autism is rather like trying to understand the world on the basis of your left hemisphere alone here's another question and I'm going to run out of questions I mean I won't run out of questions so I've been involved in this systems ecology group for 20 years I've got hundreds and hundreds of contacts who live around the world who are looking at how energy, money, climate change, biodiversity, politics, anthropology fit together into cohesive story I would say that relative to the standard population the preponderance of people with Asperger's or something similar is very much high in this group of people and I wonder if it's something to do with the ability to separate out the noise which the left brain is very good at focusing on and stepping back and looking at the whole picture total speculation just wondering if you have any input there. Well I wouldn't want to be dogmatic and I think that might come into it but there are a couple of other things that come to mind and one is the capacity for systematization of a linear and left hemisphere congruent kind which people with Asperger's or autism have and the other is something I have noticed and was noticed by others particularly by an important German psychiatrist called Kretschmer in the 1930s that people who are either come from families of the printer either schizophrenia or autism or Asperger's the subjects often are very focused on doing good in the abstract but are often not very good at being warm or kind to individual people so they embrace you know a brilliant idea that we're going to make the world like this and of course we need people like that but we also need to have them have their feet planted firmly on the ground because as is well known the most desperate homicidal and tyrannical regimes in the history of the world started out with people having an idea how to make humanity better and forcing them to be better. There are ways that we can expand our boundaries of empathy and care and start to recognize that we're part of a whole that we're related to all other life on the planet that this is the one blue green oasis in a dark cold universe and I think we are approaching a species level conversation so your work I actually think is foundational to that that we have to shift from a me to an us somehow. Now there's been in the last couple years a lot of movement towards psychedelics like ayahuasca or five MEO DMT from toad or mushrooms or non-drugs like chanting or rave parties or just going out in nature but can these substances access the relational skills of the right brain or what do you think about all that? Well in brief the psychedelics which to me are relatively uninteresting though they can indeed have lasting effects on people I know from personal testimonies of people not my own that this can happen. I don't think that it's liberating the right hemisphere and I explain why I don't think that's what's happening in the matter with things I think probably what is happening is that the frontal lobes are being suppressed and the frontal lobes are if you like the filters that by their effect of inhibiting the more posterior cortex shape our reality by making sense of it and so when you take them off you get a flood of stimuli with no particular you know way of having filtered that perhaps in the absence of filtering by the frontal cortex we are more open to spiritual messages but I think that there are very many other ways that we can much more sound ways you know it's being very much promoted psychedelics as the answer to depression and other things but the reason for that is that it will cost the pharmaceutical industry absolutely nothing to market these substances they're already known and they will have they'll never need to work again because they can just make money out of providing these purified substances and so they are very much skewing the the dialogue on this and what's not known so widely is that you can have terrible experiences using psychedelics which are devastating to your psyche so you're playing with fire so I would like to take the conversation away from that and to the things that really really do matter if you're happy with that which are relating to a society to a social group relating to nature and relating to some whatever you like to call it higher power divine ground the sacred these things are not just my opinion that they're important for us there is vast research that shows that they are very important for mental well-being for physical well-being well-being for cognitive skill and for the cohesion of a society so clearly the sacred or the belief in any deity or god or anything like that has to emanate from the right hemisphere so right now to me it seems like the belief in religion is is waning as the driving force relative to the last couple hundred years but also right now the belief in economic growth or the you know capitalism and economic growth has become a religion of sorts so neither of those I mean that's what our sacred is now and you don't know much about my work Ian but I'm a champion for the 10 million other species we share this planet with and I deeply view the natural world as sacred and that's what's our calling right now is we kind of had to go through this last 200 years of Las Vegas smorgasbord uh energy um orgy of of of things uh to maybe recognize whoa uh maybe the next technology is inner tech in our minds um towards this this sacred destination uh what what do you think about all that well first of all I'm I you know that that I believe in the importance of the other living elements of our of our planet um and even even things that we think of as inanimate and exploits have their value and their place so I wholly agree with you we're we're seeing from the hape same hymn sheet there I'm not sure that religion only comes from the right hemisphere but I do think you're right that the most important parts of religious experience and practice seem to be the consensus is seem to be underwritten by the right hemisphere the left hemisphere is was necessary for systematizing it and turning it into a durable um phenomenon such as Christianity or whatever it may be Islam or but but in doing so it often over legalizes makes over certain over fixed what should be less certain more fluid more or inspiring in fact I think we've lost the capacity for three very important things a sense of awe or wonder a sense of our own humility and or the humility we should have and compassion and I think these are the things that most religions that are real religions or spiritual traditions that are true spiritual traditions have in common that they induce and re re can kindle in us a sense of wonder they make us feel appropriately humble about what we can do and what we can know and they increase sense of oneness with and compassion towards the rest of the created world now I think that is is what's going wrong I think this we've completely failed to understand that religion is not about a matter of propositional belief but dispositional belief belief is a matter of a disposition of your your your consciousness towards the world in a certain way it's not about propositions that you know six impossible things that you have to believe before breakfast that's not for a relationship about and what I want to do in in my work is take people from a standpoint where they will almost certainly be part of the the culture that believes that only somebody rather simple or you know uneducated would think that there was a divine realm to position where they will see that only somebody who's rather simple or uneducated would think that would just want to rule that out I'm not saying would become suddenly religious but I think it's extremely clear that people who either are fundamentalist religious or fundamentalist atheists are on the wrong track and that they have more in common with one another than they have with true believing people in any case I just think that that business of the ever-evolving deeper relationship a loving relationship with the world in all its manifestations is is the secret of human well-being and happiness and you say that there is now a different religion that of economic growth and so on and I you know have quenched in myself in the last 24 hours of it with with what you've you've said about this I find it very compelling I'm sure you're you're broadly right and it reminds me of something that GK Chesterton said that when people stop believing in God they don't believe in nothing they believe in anything and that anything for them is their own power to become more and more rich powerful wealthy and that leaves out of the count just about everything that sustains human happiness and in the seeking for it they will never find happiness as a psychiatrist I can tell you that the most successful people the richest people the most powerful people are not the world's happiest people as a former high net worth stockbroker on wall street I totally concur with that assessment so you mentioned earlier there were some previous cultures that were successful at this empathy and compassion and a sense of you didn't mention sacred but what were the commonalities in these societies and how did that evolve or don't we have historical data to know what happened yes it's difficult one thing that's a surprise is that a properly functioning society in which the two hemispheres are really working in the complementary but asymmetrical way that they should seem to arise just like that that you think that the civilization took a very long time to build you know but actually these civilizations just sort of seem to arise in a relatively short time span and work well and then gradually always move further towards the right hemisphere and one of the aspects of this is I could put it this way that the left hemisphere is always trying to close down on a certainty but the right hemisphere is always trying to open up to a possibility and that explains much of the difference between the way the hemisphere see the world and in these early stages of civilization people are very open to possibility and this is a very fruitful frame of mind they have very few sentences but they know that nothing will prosper unless they give of themselves it's no good sitting back and waiting for it to build itself so a civilization goes through one might say three phrases really and and and this is being very beautifully written about by Patrick Offalls in a book called a moderate greatness a very short book when he points out that he was on this podcast Ian oh was he oh fantastic well he's a bit of a good friend of mine oh yeah that's great he's 90 years old and he's sharp as attack he's just great I'm always recommending his book to people but as you know I mean he suggested in the first phase people are very brave um they they give of themselves they're generous spirited they create things and they defend them and so on and then there comes a period when the as well the groundwork has been laid and now we can move on to more sophisticated things we get the arising of philosophy and art and and so forth and that's a very benign phase but after a while we go into a decadent phase where people just expect that this is the normal that they don't have to do anything for it to carry on that it's their right that it is you know I'm always when people say a right I always a little mental question where does this right come from exactly I'm not saying that there is no use for the term right but I think it needs to be you know thought about rather more carefully than we do anyway I think this is what happens and I can see certainly movements in eastern civilizations which all my life have fascinated me I'm probably a Taoist um I'm probably a Buddhist um and I'm very interested in the Vedanta and in these traditions you see a kind of wisdom that comes from a degree of humility of letting go of control of letting go of certain knowledge in order to attain wisdom you know the the Tao De Ching begins with the line the Tao that can be named is not the real Tao and you know it also contains the lines that the master does nothing but nothing is left undone I mean that those those need to be glossed but they're really a way of saying that our obsession with immediate action and doing and being busy and increasing our knowledge is actually a way of stopping ourselves achieving either peace or wisdom and in the context of this conversation I mean whether people in achieve peace for themselves it's a personal matter but if they don't achieve some wisdom if there aren't people speaking wisely our civilization is definitely doomed so again this is our first conversation um despite having mutual friends and mutual interest one of the key learnings for me this past decade uh in brain research was that humans didn't evolve to see reality um fitness at the time mattered more than than truth and I I've taught a class at the University of Minnesota called Reality 101 a survey of the human predicament and it's an environmental class for mostly for freshmen but can learning about reality about the different hemispheres about our brains about supernormal stimuli and and all the different things we inherited from our ancestors um and their interrelationships can that change our behavior at the individual and ultimately at the couch cultural level or does it have to come at a two-part question so my work here with this podcast is to educate and warn people about the future that Patrick Ophels uh also believes is happening is that our energy surplus declines and as the the carrying capacity and environmental health of our world decline we're we're in for a tough road um so in my articulating and having conversations with you and others do the facts matter or is it really a do we need like a new narrative of meaning of sacredness and the facts don't matter as much that's that's a big bite what what do you think about that I think facts are important um I think in certain areas of life claiming things to be facts needs to be carefully done but the but we shouldn't lose the sense that there are facts I think that what science teaches us is important very important as a road to truth I think that reason properly understood are you not just a kind of rationalizing about things that could be done by chat GPT but I mean the fusion of the experience of a life well lived and judgment based on that and the ability to see things in the overall context combined with the ability to think clearly and express oneself clearly is very important I also think that letting go of those things is important because they have limitations they can't expect to be used to answer some of the big questions which appear paradoxical to the left hemisphere but nonetheless are on the path to the deep realities as Niels Bohr perhaps the greatest figure in the genesis of quantum physics said and as the great leaders of most religious leads in the mystical traditions of most religions and spiritual pathways have said so in the second part of the matter with things the first part I'm just looking at really what we need to understand about the left hemisphere's incapacity to be in touch with the real world compared with the right hemisphere now that's the reverse of what the prop psychology thing tells us the left hemisphere may be boring and down to earth but at least it's you know it's reliable um however that's not the case it's extremely unreliable compared with the right hemisphere which is much more in touch with reality and a much better touchstone when we come to decide what we should believe anyway that's part one but in part two I look at the various pathways to truth and I say they are science reason and intuition and imagination and that all four of these need to be brought to bear if we're going to function properly as a society and understand who we are what we're doing here and how we are to relate to the world at large and then in the last part of the book it's metaphysics and I look at things like the the coincidence of opposites the one and the many but also things like time space matter consciousness values purpose and the sense of the sacred so I'm looking at all of those things so what I want to say is my book is based on science and on a lot of philosophizing so there's a great deal of facts in it I quote in one book five thousand five hundred sources and in the other about two and a half thousand so together there's a lot so I do rely on those things and I think that our tendency to to um for example dismiss science if it happens to say things that are not fashionable or politically correct is absolutely a disaster for us all and for science so science is non-negotiable in that sense and although everything can you need to look at the light in which it's interpreted but we can't do away with it so I think understanding what is going on in our heads and how it's affecting the way we see the world is really important and in that sense I'd go as far as to say that if we're to get out of this situation people always say so what are we to do what are we to do and they want you know half a dozen bullet points and are you know half a dozen bullet points that I can give but in a way they're they're at a very low level they're like practical things that can be done now and they're not unimportant but actually I know that unless we change the whole way we conceive what humanity is what the world is and how the two create connect we will not get this right and it wouldn't even matter if we did save our skins because we would not have saved our souls and without that we would just continue being the same frustrated greedy desperate people that we seem to be now so I think we have to see the predicament and the reason I think that I would like as many people as possible to read and talk about my work is it's a contribution to that debate you know that it's a really substantial thing that it costs me you know decades of my life and I think that people are responding to it by the messages I get all the time from people saying your your work has changed my life now if most writers if they get that once they're delighted but I get that get that every day in fact today amongst several messages that kind of got one that said it would be an underestimate to say that your work has changed my life so I'm not I'm delighted always to hear this because I don't know I can only tell whether this is important from the reactions I get from other people but I think unless you know I'm a psychiatrist and I learned very early on that you can tell what people need to do very very early on and you can say it but they won't do it because they need to have been brought to the place where they see for themselves that that's what they need to do so we need to get humanity to a point where they see for themselves that what they're doing is crazy suicidal are you taking on new patients no no I'm 70 and I had to make a decision some time ago that you know I was going to write and lecture rather than carry on with the day job so no I was being facetious but what you just said rings hella true to me so I was being facetious so what I hear you saying is that science is necessary but insufficient and that if we look at the human predicament with climate change and population and resource depletion and everything else and if we try to construct a path through that using only engineers and architects we will fail because we have to look at the other uh what did you say imagination creativity you had four four categories we have to integrate all of those intuition and imagination and I know that intuition is often a target for people in cognitive neuroscience and of course some people have made a career out of it like Dan Kahneman and professionally suspicious of intuition I talk about his work which is in many ways very important in in my book the matter of things but I think that intuitions had a bad rap and because there are certain situations which are the highly artificial in which you can show that following your intuition won't lead to the right answer that is the flip side of the fact that we are we are able to make very complex decisions fairly quickly using intuition although intuition is not thinking fast sometimes intuitions are deep and take a long time to come through and sometimes rationalizing is what we do thinking fast and quickly so you know people sometimes say is Kahneman's you know type one thinking um the right hemisphere and type two thinking left no if anything it would be the other way around but it's really more that type one thinking is sub-cortical is kind of almost instinctive whereas a richer combination of intuition and reason involves both hemispheres so it's a it's a different thing but anyway I just wanted to put in a word for intuition because I think our willingness to um discard discontent to and um generally despise our intuitions is one of the reasons we've become so stupid I mean there are many things that I believe now that if there is a humanity in the future people will look back on it as the most absurd era we are part of the most ridiculous era of humanity in which completely improbable and very stupid things are said by highly intelligent people and if they had any contact at all with their intuitions they would guide them to a much much wiser place so I suspect that lots of people in our culture have trauma we are living through an absolute crazy twilight zone sort of era a lot of people are stressed I think intuitively the listeners and viewers of this program will agree with you that they would like to expand or lean into their right brain more they want to be connected with the birds and the trees and their garden and with relationships at a slower pace and they see how everything is connected and they care like you and I do about the 10 million other species we share the planet with but the needs of the day we have to have a job to get health insurance otherwise we go broke if we get sick we have to build defense mechanisms against all the polarization shouting on on YouTube and in social media are the wants of the day forcing the left brain to take over and not allow people to reflect on the relationships between everything what what do you think about that well let me be clear there is nothing wrong with the left hemisphere in itself it's a very valuable servant it is the emissary to the master and as such is irreplaceable we need it and we need the work that it can do all I'm really saying is that it must be aware that it is a servant not the master and at the moment it thinks it's the master it thinks it has all the answers and that's the bit that makes it a problem so I'm not saying of course I'm not and I think I started what I've just been saying by saying that we really do need the everyday stuff we need the jobs and we need to put in place particular measures legal measures maybe scientific plans to try and stop the poisoning of the oceans all that all of that I agree with but what I'm really saying is that that's not enough that's only a part of the story and and perhaps in some ways although it sounds stupid to say this is less important than being able to see things in a different way because if we did we wouldn't need we wouldn't need to be doing it all by constraint and restraint we need constraints and restraints in life one of the paradoxes is that for a society to be free it needs to observe certain restraints but when you say we need to have um whatever it was you said mechanisms in place to sort of police the social media if we were more aware of the shallowness as a way we talk and think so often nowadays in sound bites and without having really thought about things deeply and probably not from a background of humane education which is now a rarity compared with what it was 40 50 years ago if we were aware of that there wouldn't be the need to police it in that way you know I mean during my lifetime people have become obviously much less civilized they've become um willing and able to treat one another with greater violence verbal physical and in other ways so we're not we're in a realm where we're so badly dehumanized already that the only way to help is by imposing kind of rules which in themselves constrain our better nature as well as our unfortunate tendencies of of now so in that last bit you mentioned the word aware or awareness four times I right now have a new coach who's an expert in something called Feldenkrais which is awareness through movement and her advice to me is all I'm asking for you is for awareness and once you become aware of something then for the first time you have choices and a couple days ago she sent me this beautiful quote by Victor Frankel between stimulus and response there is a space in that space is our power to choose our response in our response lies our growth and our freedom so I'm just wondering how that maps if at all to the left brain right brain story that you're unpacking is the left brain jumping into this space in our culture and then owning the narrative in response and would more awareness kind of give us a more merger of the two hemispheres in a healthy way what I'd certainly say is that that is a wonderful the quote that I know from Victor Frankel who is a very very great man of course and I think that what I'm suggesting without going one way or other on the hemispheres is that we are too ready to jump in we have lost the art of thinking deeply of pondering of embracing silence of thinking in a longer term over a broader span which you narrow especially and temporally if you like in the way in which we think we're too committed to a point of view that we may never have been taught to challenge and so forth so what I'm saying is that we live in a society that is becoming stupid because reflective reading proper acquaintance with history not in some ridiculous propagandizing way in which we either uncritically accept it or uncritically despise it but in fact trying to understand the people who are not necessarily any less wise than we were who came before us and what they created for us and what we owe to them so not having that not having been taught to think on two sides of a question we're reacting in two peremptory way and slowing down would be a very very fine thing most of what we do would be better done more slowly there are very few things that are done well by just speeding them up and yet we live in a world which is constantly demanding more and more speed less and less reflection right and so we're compelled to use the devil's tools to do guy's work of a sort I mean I feel that every day I mean look at us we're using you know high technology to communicate these ideas to more people in an attempt to hopefully have people learn and slow down in their own lives so so so getting to that one of my prior guests who I believe is a friend of yours Tomas Bjorkman he's an advocate of nurturing inner development skills which he categorizes as being thinking relating collaborating and and acting so do you think reflective practices and teachings such as those can can reconnect the balancing of the two hemispheres or leaving this hemisphere's aside just make us more holistic human beings in this time of of tumult yes I do um um there are certain things we can't experience unless we slow down and that we must experience when we speed up when we speed up we become fearful we become panic-stricken and I think we should stop panicking which is not to say anything about being aware of the gravity of our situation in fact we'll be more aware of the gravity of our situation if we stop and reflect I think we should cultivate things like gratitude which we won't do if we're rushing through life appreciating what we have while we still have it um appreciating silence silence is like water to me it's like some delicious nourishing liquid I can't get enough of it it's one of the reasons I live where I do in a rather remote part of a Scottish island and when I have to go as I quite often do back into modern urban life I'm initially overwhelmed by its its madness I'm sure there are pockets where people can find the necessary stillness but unless they do they're going to rush headlong to their death so they're going to push us all over that cliff faster than ever um if we have a chance to stop it would be a very good thing to do I think we should reconnect as I say with with the natural world spend more time there and listen to it we should pray and meditate more and that also means listening not talking it means adapting your ear to hear what is constantly being said to you by by the universe by what exists we have a I'm saying everything is in relationships and those relationships are always two-way they'll always reverberate it and we drive out what we could learn by constantly talking and so what we need to do is to cultivate mindfulness if you like or an attitude of prayer which which is also a matter of listening not demanding anything but trying to reflect on what one can know in relation to spiritual values particularly um you know and and I think so a slower culture would be a great thing and when we're actually hurtling towards the precipice why would we try and speed it up by inventing ever more sophisticated technology that will push us faster and faster that way is technology is just a way of giving people power and power is neither good nor bad it depends on who's wielding it and to what end it needs wisdom and at the moment what we're doing is we're creating very powerful mechanism we're giving them to people who haven't any of the wisdom to use them properly and so what we need is more wisdom not more power and I'm afraid the way we're talking at the moment it's all about increasing our power to do things this has got us into the mess and as Einstein famously said we don't get out of the mess by the same means that got us into it we need to be starting to simplify I think one of your your terms is the great simplification we need to simplify our lives our goals uh what do we expect out of life and in some way sophisticated what we feel we can give to life I have four questions in response to what you just said my first one is what sort of megafauna and wildlife do you have on the isle of sky what's interesting there that you periodically or rarely see um above all we have very interesting bird life there are eagles that nest on the mountain behind my house golden eagles we also have fish eagles we have raptors of various kinds but we also have marsh birds we have um woodland birds um in my garden you get garden birds so we have an extraordinarily rich panoply of of bird life um there are animals there are deer wild deer of course on the island much of the land is cultivated where it can be or at least given over to sheep and cattle so the kind of farm animals but there are there is a range of wildlife as you know if you try to keep chickens as I do and and sometimes that the wild mammalian life is not necessarily on your side or not on your chicken side anyway um so there's a lot of that and very beautiful landscape I mean it's just um a staggering mixture of of things that I never get used to I see it and it takes my breath away yeah I I'm blessed to live where I do on the Mississippi River um and there are lots of wild animals here and it's my biggest joy in life is to see something like a fox when I'm on a bike ride etc so I just wanted to ask you that so um you talked about us uh slower culture um I agree with that um but how would that come about it's certainly not from any top down regulations or laws or rules it almost has to come out about from from individual humans realizing this starting to listen more starting to focus on relationships and maybe that expands outward to a critical mass do you have any speculation on that well I think you're exactly right that it must start with individual people but that sounds like a very tall order when we've got to make things make things happen you know yes we're in a crisis but we won't be so effective if we think we need to rush to make things happen if only three percent of the population saw the kind of vision of the world the kind of meaning in the world that I hope to unveil to readers we would automatically move not by top down control but by an inner desire we would be led to things that I can't now specify what they will be because they will be different from every person that is the wonderful thing about it of something that is generated from within and goes outwards rather than something that is a straight jacket that comes down from above and I think there's something to be said for relaxing some of the controls because we need to learn how to discipline ourselves um the culture of particularly my grandparents and and of my parents was so very much more one of self-discipline and selflessness than the culture that I now inhabit and it meant that a lot of things didn't have to be policed or ruled or legislated about in the way that they are now of course it wasn't a perfect world I'm certainly not suggesting that for a minute and you know in the background all sorts of things were undoubtedly going on but the fact is that we've become morally like somebody who's decided for no very good reason that they need a wheelchair and after they've been in the wheelchair for quite a long time they would be much better off without the wheelchair but they can't now stand without that wheelchair and we're like that morally speaking we need all these props and supports to keep us on the right line but if we're to survive we need to get back to a place in which we re integrate into our personality and into our sense of ourselves some sense of what is now seems so old-fashioned like being a decent person like being you know an honorable person but being magnanimous by being generous by being faithful all these things that you know we now think we're far cleverer than that that's the kind of stuff for stupid people who don't really know how to win we're gonna win and of course that attitude has destroyed a society that was actually working relatively well so I think we've got to get back there the bad news is that I don't think that's going to happen until some sort of catastrophe has happened which will insist on it that we learn again how to look after one another in small groups to trust one another to work together to have much simpler ambitions and and demands on the planet to be able to grow our own food to relearn skills that our ancestors had but we thought we didn't need could we got machines and generally I think you know people say well you know what's going to happen will life die out I don't see any evidence that life will die out I think our way of life as it now is must die out it can't go on and I think that a lot of humans sadly will not survive but I think that humanity will probably survive and will be the better for it we need we're so badly adrift now that we need something that will you know inspire us to re-embrace our deeper humanity that's really what I'm saying well it's no wonder that you like Patrick Ophel's writing he says very similar things and and I say very similar things you're inspiring to me this conversation is inspiring what we're trying to do is change the initial conditions of that catastrophe or that moment in the future so that there's a wider array of positive or more benign outcomes that happen one of the other constraints that I that I see is there are people listening to this and nodding their heads and saying this makes sense I want to move my life in this direction a little bit I want to be one of those 3% but then a few hours later Candy Crush and their little social media feeds and the things on their phone and in our our pal mel smorgasbord tech culture virtual world shouts louder to our brains than the reality that you are describing so we get pulled back into that vortex do you have recommendations for for people on how to how to push that aside or how to inhibit that um that craving a little bit towards this longer term path well I think as usual it's a matter of finding a balance but a balance that is very far from where we are now so I think that my advice would be drastically to reduce any use of social media whatever I don't actually use it myself at all and somebody does my publicity for me so that's nice I can it's kind of if you like a hypocrisy for me that you know I need the message to get out there but I don't want to be on social media however I work hard at putting the measure out the message out there by doing things like exactly what we are doing now and some of my friends say they can't go anywhere on the internet without bumping into me so you can't please everybody anyway um I think grossly limiting all eliminating all together eliminating social media would be a very good thing um perhaps limiting how much and in what way you use the internet um trying not to fuel despair but instead to think of ways in which you can increase love and the embrace of things that are beautiful and good and truthful and to eliminate resentment from your life and try instead to to see what is good and and to listen to other people even if they say things very different from you um one of the great calamities of the public debate at the moment is if we don't do a very very simple thing then you know any therapist who's ever done couple therapy knows which is you know you get one person talking and you say no no no let him talk and and you'll have your turn in a minute and then at the end of that you turn to the other partner and say so what did you hear your partner just say and and that's very instructive for everybody and if we did that more we would get round misunderstanding because you say well actually that's what you heard me say but that's not what I meant what I meant was this I see and then you've got a dialogue Gary but at the moment we're just shouting one another down and and anybody who has a certain kind of opinion which embraces many opinions that seem to me to be full of wisdom must be an outcast and so it's an extraordinary situation in which the people that need to be heard can't speak without being shouted down by those who are full of their own importance and narcissistically sure that they are the good people who are fighting for the good only one thing I'd like to get across is the idea of the dark side very important idea again in psychology everybody has a dark side and there's a dark side to everything that we promote is good and there's a good side often to things that we want to eliminate I mean there are certain things that are non-negotiable I agree and we're better without them but usually it's complicated and there's good and bad mixed in most of the things that we need to be thinking about here but anyway that's that that's the kind of advice that I'd give embrace stillness embrace peace and and and love your friends and love nature and and love life you know I I just started three weeks ago on the advice of another coach Silent Saturdays where I turned my phone and computers off and it's been way more difficult than I would have thought but that's a story for another day but I totally agree with everything you just said another follow-up question to your previous thing that you mentioned AI again so is this another thing that in our race to develop artificial intelligence are we in effect hypercharging this left brain dynamic that you're talking about and further atrophying the right brain's contribution and do you think second part of the question do you think it's possible to create an AI or an AGI that does contain a balance of right and left brain and and imbues more wisdom into the system or would that only happen after we changed the goals of the system away from unbridled economic growth any any thoughts there well I have a view that may be unpopular with some but is that when we talk of artificial intelligence we're not really talking about intelligence at all we're talking about a following of certain procedures that gives a simulacrum of intelligence but is not intelligence and and in some sense that is important because I don't think that ever-increasing sophistication of AI will will help us because it can never be wise it for that it would have to have a body it would have to have emotions it would have to be a truly social being it would have to have empathy it would have to have suffered I don't want to be consoled by an AI mechanism created by some clever psychology that talks me through a crisis because I want to know that the person I'm talking to is a fellow member of humanity that has suffered as I suffer and knows that I know that I'm going to die so I think that is a dead end for what we need um what I worry it will do is make us think that it's intelligent and give it more credence than it should get and even if that doesn't happen what is very worrying is that we are seeing people and even talking more and more like machines we're seeing people as machines we're becoming more like machines the language in which we talk about human functions is now the language of AI one's data banks and uploading things and in one's mind you know um and because we're in everyday life forced to interact with incredibly stupid mechanisms that are on the internet I mean the people who used to ring up to solve a problem weren't Einstein they probably had a fairly low IQ but in five minutes they could sort out understand exactly what you wanted and get it done now you can spend not only a morning but I've discovered trying to get one thing changed on Amazon a whole team of us have spent nearly eight weeks trying to get it fixed and it's very simple we can we can do all this you know clever stuff like create a robot that looks somewhat like a kind of an abortion of a human being but nonetheless we can't do simple stuff and that has an immense impact on daily life I know I haven't got much time left to live but an unreasonable amount of it is taken up in doing procedural stuff that bulks now vastly greater in my life I mean I was just talking to my daughter who is training as a psychotherapist and she's saying you know the trouble is I have to spend so much time filling in things on the internet going on platforms doing this that and the other crikey when I was training there was absolutely none of that so we've got ourselves into a really stupid corner it's artificial stupidity that is taking us over we don't it's artificial so we don't have to obey it we need to embrace our own capacity for wisdom which is in bringing together intuition and imagination not fantasy but true imagination to get you into the heart of reality our only chance of doing so along with science and reason so sorry that was a bit of a bit of a splurge there but I think that you know it's important that we can't rely on AI for any of these things and that the effort that goes into it would be much better put into things that are quite practical that we could do so my contribution will be to no longer call it artificial intelligence or AI but ASI artificial simulacrum intelligence there by naming the beast so you mentioned imagination along with intuition and in one of your videos or something I read from you how important is the need for the space to allow creativity in developing the health of an individual do you have any stories of that and how does allowing that space contrast with the expectations and trajectories that we currently put on our youth especially in the United States context where young people get into debt and get addicted and distracted and all that do you have any stories or on the importance of imagination and creating space I do indeed you know it's often said that science was very creative in the period between say the 20s and the 60s or 70s but since then what has mainly happened is technological refinements rather than real breakthroughs in science and what happened during that period very often was that people worked either alone or in small groups of perhaps two or three people but mainly something like the Rand corporation took bright people gave them an office and a desk and a salary and said do whatever it is that you think is important to do and you know there's a risk involved in that but one of the problems with our cultures are so risk averse and if you there is a risk that somebody will abuse it but if you don't take that risk then we're on to hiding to nothing because nothing will come of micro managing people towards an outcome if you take creative people and tell them they've got to publish a paper every few months explaining what they're doing they will never reach the point from which they can actually see a picture that coheres now I've been fortunate in that I've gone into various things quite deeply but I've also been able to see the big picture and one of the reasons why is that in all my education from my teams onwards I was allowed an enormous amount of freedom I was expected to work very hard at technical things at maths at you know at ancient languages and so on which are not a piece of cake and that's fine that was part of my education but I was also left with an immense amount of free time to read as I thought best and follow up things that I was being taught and that went on through university and eventually ended in my getting a kind of fellowship which a version of which still exists but I think they're trying to make it more left hemisphere I'm afraid which is a fellowship a prize fellowship of all souls which you you got after sitting a three-day exam if you were lucky and that gave me seven years and nobody insisted that I published anything in fact I did publish a book about five years or so into the fellowship or maybe it was a bit longer than that and at the time I wondered what I was doing because I was following many things I followed science I went to philosophy seminars I found a teacher so that I could learn Russian and it all kinds of things and then at the end of it I thought I needed to train in medicine which I did and then in psychiatry and neuro psychiatry and all that so but that was because I plowed a very unconventional furrow and the system was flexible enough to allow it I don't think that system is any longer so flexible I think people will want somebody to account for themselves all the time now the thing that's important to know is that great scientists and mathematicians of whom I cite many examples in in the matter with things you usually found out the great discoveries after a fallow period in which they really were either at a dead end or they'd stopped thinking about it and their mind had moved on to something else and then suddenly one day you know famously as as his foot you know landed on the bus the solution to vaccine equations came to um oh god I forgot my own name now but anyway you never have your primary so um this this freedom is really important and in retrospect for a long time I wondered perhaps I wasted that time but now I know that I didn't waste it because it enabled me to write books that are both deeply grounded in the kind of technical stuff but also you know spacious enough to bring together psychology history anthropology you know with art and Persian music and and so on and you know some people think that well that must mean that they don't want to read it and they can't be any good because how can anybody you know seriously know anything about all those things but fine I don't speaking to them I'm speaking to people who want to know something that's come from you know having a lot of free time to think it's not really free in the sense of pointless or you know it's free in the sense that I can be the decider as to what I do so in a way though that's one linkage between your story and mine is the energy surplus of the industrial revolution and late 20th century enabled someone like you to have the creativity in the space to lay the foundations of writing two well three really because your last book is in two pieces tomes on the human condition and the human brain which is kind of a product of energy surplus which isn't going to be with us for long so this this is it this is our our species level moment to know where to potentially know where we came from how we got here what we're doing what we really need what the impacts are what is open to us in the future and it's it's both unbelievably tragic and stunningly beautiful and profound at the same time you call it energy surplus which is very much a way of thinking about it I understand that but what I would call it is a sophisticated civilization the legacy of the Renaissance the Enlightenment Victorian hard work and that the kind of institutions of now that are now busily trying to destroy their excellence that can provide that um had it if you like you can call all civilization to do with a kind of energy surplus that you know that was true in the Renaissance and so forth I understand that but it wasn't to do with energy surplus in the sense that we mean since the industrial revolution it had very little to do with that the kind of work I was encouraged to do and the kind of conversations I was encouraged to have apart from the fact that they included up-to-date science were very much the sort of continuation of a tradition of scholarship really and and we seem to have turned our backs on that except in some rather wonderful places where people are now starting up colleges that really are serious about learning in a broad sense and and and you know not just passing on propaganda but actually enabling people to think freely and in a balanced way about the predicament we find ourselves in so that's a good sign there are good signs I mean one of the things that really encourages me is the number of young people who write to me often scientists and say this stuff that you're writing is so fantastic and I'm starting to do a project on this and can you advise and so on which usually I can't but nonetheless the enthusiasm for it is extremely important to me and gives me hope for the future I I agree with that I get I get similar feedback all the time I want to be respectful of your time but I do have some some closing questions that I ask all my viewers but before that a building on what you just said how would you in a perfect world redesign the education system if if you were in charge so that you would take into account a lot of the the wisdom and and the science that you've discovered over decades towards better preparing young human beings towards the future of the 21st century to be you know left brain right brain more balanced to be slower to spend time in nature to meditate what would you do to change the education system because in my view the education system itself has become a out of control super organism that feeds on its own demands etc well in in in short I'd re humanize it and the emphasis only on stem subjects is a product of this feeling that we need to increase productivity but that will get us nowhere on its own we desperately need to have intelligent knowledgeable human beings who who are aware of the culture that to which they owe so much and are not taking a sledgehammer to it and and so I would reintroduce the humanities including some emphasis on on music on drama on poetry and on philosophy in the sense that there are different ways in history of thinking about things and to see some of them you'll think like this and to see others you'd think like that and thus broadening people's horizons and seeing that there are you know there are often many sides to any one question I think that would be a very important thing I think that young people should be taught mindfulness in school from an early age I think the whole rhetoric of mechanistic determinism should not be the assumed model for the cosmos and that really means introducing I don't know how it would best be done but something of spirituality again into the into the curriculum the exact thousand wherefores are not for me to stay but I think that that would be good I also think that emphasis on the being right answers in exams rather than demonstrating intelligent thinking you know that that should be played down you know there are ways in which you can be wrong but have given a fantastically interesting answer to a question whereas somebody else who just you know follows everyone else and says the right thing may have been very unintelligent in their response so I that's the way I'd look at it we need to be freer we need to trust we need to trust teachers for god's sake we need to trust university lectures we need to trust doctors we need to you know we we shouldn't be telling them all the time how to do that let's managerialize out of existence I mean who'd want to be a teacher now who'd want to be a doctor you know it is a reality that started in the in the in the 80s that managers started to tell doctors how to do their job well and and there are more of them now than the doctors and they're better paid than the doctors and their culture is a nonsense because it you know it's not the culture that you work extremely hard to have the experience and knowledge of a doctor can be and the same is true of a teacher a teacher makes a gift of a relationship with a child the people who really taught me anything we're on fire with the thing is that it that inspired them and they communicated that spark to me and it might not have been on the curriculum but I will remember it all my life we've turned the planet into a business as a species and I agree with you regarding teaching I may have no money at all but it was the most rewarding thing I've ever done with these 17 18 19 year olds um yeah ancient wisdom from my understanding in India have long known about the brain hemispheres just a penultimate question here from a western medical and psychological perspective are there specific practices recommended for rebalancing the hemispheres you mentioned a few of them earlier but could the wisdom of the eastern religions you mentioned Taoism Buddhism be integrated with the modern imbalance of the west and how would that come about well absolutely the people just need to acquaint themselves with this and at school I got to know Heraclitus and I thought he was far more interesting than Plato and then about 20 I read Alan Watts's Tao the watercourse way and that reconnected me with the pre-socratic philosophers like Heraclitus and it was another you know life-changing moment when I read that book and since then Taoism has always been part of my thinking so people people can start by picking up books but it's not about reading a book it's like you can't learn to swim by reading a book about it you need to get in the water and do it and you can't actually experience what people mean by religious religious life by simply reading about it you have to start committing yourself to something so that's a very important insight on how this sort of thing works but what I would say is that I've mentioned already things like mindfulness which is almost the clearest example I can give of recruiting the right hemisphere and trying to silence the ever chattering ever judgmental left hemisphere and allowing things as Heidegger says to presence before us rather than simply be represented in our minds so that's a good thing and the arts in general as I say but also leading a certain kind of life and the ambition to lead that life being put into children at school and it's not a fix it's not something they can get tomorrow but they need to begin to start the steps on a journey that will be a lifelong journey that will take them ever deeper into a country they need to know and where they belong so it's about it's about changing the way we think about everything's got to be a quick fix and there's got to be an answer and a test to make sure people have got it and all that but that is really beside what I'm talking about I just want to say can I say add this that it's not just it's not just the eastern religions that seem to show an understanding of the relationship between the hemispheres and I quote you know the Daodu Jing and and I quote the Yi Qing and all these things in the book because they have extraordinary insights into the relationship between the hemispheres as soon as you know about you can see that they intuited this without having brain scanners but the most remarkable example is a story by the Onondaga people who are part of the Iroquois nation and I tell it at you know some length it's the first six pages of part three of the book it's absolutely staggering I can't tell it now but these people intuited exactly the relationship between the hemispheres and what was going to happen when the the brother as they call the two brothers with one brother who doesn't know as much as the other when that brother starts to take control so I mean they saw they foresaw all of this anyway sorry that was just an addendum to my answer homo sapiens clever but seldom wise um so you've you've talked about culture and you've talked about from the perspective of education system but what about young humans specifically do you have any recommendations for 18 to 25 year old human beings around the world who are aware of climate change and resource depletion and polarization in our economy and the constraints to the human enterprise that are listening to this and nodding their heads agreeing with the wisdom that you're sharing what what advice do you have for young humans not to be afraid to trust their intuitions but to question them as you question everything everything you're told without necessarily that leading to your dismissing it but just making sure that you've seen both sides of everything um taking strength from a spiritual tradition knowing the works in it belonging to it nourishing your soul at the fount of art and music dedicating yourself to practical good works either locally or as part of an organization that you admire as long as you still are in it and continue to admire it there can come a time when you may decide it happens so often in institutions as it's become more of a barrier to achieving its original aim than it is promoting it as William James said already in the 19th century um uh not necessarily believing everything that experts tell you but at least while you're young thinking it's quite a good idea to listen to what experts say about this um with time you may see what you can you know what of that that quote wisdom was really wisdom and what wasn't and and act appropriately believe in the power of humanity to surprise us you know there was homo habilis and there is homo sapiens clever homo wise homo and you know we are supposed to do that homo sapiens but we have it in us to be wise in a way that no other creature can be wise that wisdom is the product of hard work long self-discipline and immersion in the glorious business of life and it lies the other side of knowledge so there's ignorance on one side of knowledge and there's a kind of unknowing which is wise on the other side and it has nothing to do with ignorance it's where you are in the position to be wise and so all of these things are part of a long narrative that may be frustrating to a young person who wants wisdom now but wisdom cannot be had now but you won't get it unless you make the investments in it now so the start of life is making investments in becoming a certain kind of person over time and society should encourage those steps and not say the only way forward for you is to work in some vast organization in which you have no no say no no ability to use your own initiative I think we should you know look at it organizations and a healthy one is one in which as far as possible initiative and freedom to act are passed down the tree there's got to be some upper control I understand that but as far as possible to let people manage intelligently what they're dealing with and be answerable for it and be dismissed if they've done a bad job but to take part in a life which is not just being embedded in the kind of organizations that now so many people will end up going into and and you know dare to be different but it's going to be hard work you know I dared to be different I gave up a promising academic career in order to start being a medical student when I was in my early 30s and already had a couple of children under the age of three so I didn't know whether I was more insomniac when I was working 120 hours a week in the hospital which in those days was legal it isn't now or at home so you know you live dangerously I've lived dangerously but you also need to work very very hard but if you can be prepared to work hard be honest to yourself be honorable to yourself and to others to be to be you know inspired by by some goal that seems you real and valuable that is a loving goal not just a selfish goal then go for it go for it and you know may god be with you that's all I can say and I hope you will because you know the future depends on people like you doing that I always dared to be different but I'm in my mid 50s right now and I'm firstly now investing in the things that will bring me wisdom and I wish I had started that 30 years ago when I was in my 20s I was I was much more left-brained yeah no I believe that what do you care most about in the world Ian? It's a very difficult thing to to say because I I just care about the world really you know but I care about it under the aspect of love I care about real love continuing and prospering and spreading I can't say better than that that's ultimately what life's about you can do anything you can be anything but if you don't experience love and you don't do in your own way what seems to you to be the loving thing then I'm not sure what point life has I'm sounding a bit like some fool here never a man I particularly have found on my wavelength but there we are but I'm sure he was very wise and right about many things. Is love a product of both the left and right hemispheres? It's much bigger than either hemisphere it comes from somewhere very deep below the hemispheres I believe and it takes the whole body and it takes the whole of the embodied being their heart their gut literally and their brain their soul their spirit their intelligence their everything. If you could wave a magic wand even though we know those don't exist and there was no personal recourse to your decision what is one thing one thing that you would do to improve human and planetary futures? It is again almost impossible to say and one of the reasons this is of course it can't happen and one's constrained by what can happen but I think bringing back into our lives that those things that I talked about of humility and and or if people could be made to experience those things on the daily basis if scientists could realize that they don't know so very much it's wonderful that they know what they know and that I'm with them every inch of the way in the work that it's done but that really as William James said ignorance is an ocean what we know is just a drop and that you know that that's how we are and if if we had that sense before the world and we had the sense of awe and wonder in it we would behave well to it and to one another in that aspect of love that I've described that's all I can say. So are you still writing is this going to be a trilogy maybe the last book will be how the emissary relinquished the things? I won't be doing any more big books I don't have the energy all the time but I might write a few short books I've just been reminded yesterday by Oxford University Press that I promised them a book many years ago which would be a kind of intellectual autobiography I hope a short one I'd quite like to write a short book of things I'd like to say to my younger self or to people who are growing now about the world and it will have no footnotes and no bibliography and it will be no more than a hundred pages probably much less and the other thing I've promised for a long time to write and I would very much enjoy is a book on the art created by psychotic subjects I've collected some from patients of mine I was fortunate enough to work at the Bethlehem Royal Hospital the most ancient mental hospital in the world founded in the late 14th century and it has a magnificent museum of works done by some of its patients some of them quite well known and I've always found it utterly fascinating and I'd like to write a relatively short monograph illustrated with some of these works because I think people would find it intriguing as I do this has been a great conversation it's been inspiring to me and I'm glad that we met after all this time and and hope we can continue a conversation thank you for your lifetime of work and and for your time today Dr. Ian McElchrist thank you very much Nate and I too have found it thoroughly enjoyable talking with you if you enjoyed or learned from this episode of The Great Simplification please subscribe to us on your favorite podcast platform and visit TheGreatSimplification.com for more information on future releases", "segments": [{"id": 0, "seek": 0, "start": 0.0, "end": 8.16, "text": " I would like to warmly welcome my next guest, Ian McGilchrist.
