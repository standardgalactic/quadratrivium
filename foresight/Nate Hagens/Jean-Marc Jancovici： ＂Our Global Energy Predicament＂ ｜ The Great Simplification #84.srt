1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Bienvenue Ã  la grande simplification.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:09,120
I'd like to welcome to the show Jean-Marc Giancovici.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,600
Jean-Marc is a French engineering consultant, professor,

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,160
author, and independent columnist.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,720
He is very well known in France.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,000
He's been working at the intersection of climate, energy,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,120
and economics for over 20 years.

8
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,240
He's the co-founder and associate at the Carbone 4 consultancy firm,

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,280
as well as the founding president of the Think Tank,

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
the SHIFT project.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,360
This was a weird conversation because I have never watched until a few hours

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,000
before this any of his work, and he's never watched any of my work.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,640
And we're saying almost the same things, which to me is a robust finding.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,760
And I hope to collaborate with Jean-Marc in the future.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,640
Please welcome Jean-Marc Giancovici.

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,280
Jean-Marc, good to see you. Welcome to the program.

17
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,200
Good morning.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,400
Oh, good afternoon. I just know.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,640
It is almost, almost afternoon here.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,160
You are seven hours ahead of me.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,760
So you and I have been sharing similar stories and viewpoints.

22
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,360
From what I understand, the past two decades,

23
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,680
a lot of people have told me about your work.

24
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,840
It was only this morning that I watched one of your English videos.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,760
So could you start us off by, in your own words,

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,160
give us kind of a long elevator pitch of how you see the human situation

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,280
with respect to energy, climate, systems, oil depletion, etc.

28
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,560
What's the big picture?

29
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,480
Well, actually, the big picture goes back to two centuries in rough figures.

30
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
The reason why we're today able to talk together,

31
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,760
even though we are thousands of miles apart,

32
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,120
and we all have a computer, and we all have plenty of food to eat,

33
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,360
and we all have a big house, and we all have

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,200
a means to move around, for actually not a lot of money,

35
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,360
is called fossil fuels.

36
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
What happened to humanity for the last two centuries

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,720
is that thanks to fossil fuels and thanks to machines

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,360
that were put in motion by these fossil fuels,

39
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,760
we have progressively replaced hard human labor by easy,

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,280
so to say human labor, which consists in giving orders to machines,

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,480
that plant and harvest the crops for us,

42
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,000
plant and harvest cotton and need clothes for us.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,560
We have machines that move us around, manufacture the billions of goods

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,960
that we can now purchase in stores.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,440
We have all these machines that fly, sail, move around, etc.

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,320
We have the machines that build our homes, etc.

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
Basically, we live in a world of machines,

48
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,480
and the conclusion to which I've come, I would say,

49
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,520
during the last 20 years, is that what freed the 19th and 20th centuries

50
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,640
actually bears a very simple name, coal, oil and gas,

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,840
and the internal combustion engine and the steam machine.

52
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,120
Basically, that's what happened to humanity for the last two centuries.

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
Thanks to our thanks, or no thanks, I don't know, to fossil fuels,

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,640
the number of people on earth grew from 1 billion to 8 billion.

55
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,200
Life expectancy at birth went from, let's say, a little bit under 30 in 1800

56
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,760
to the world average is probably around 65 today.

57
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,080
Even in India, life expectancy at birth is over 70,

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,520
so we have, again, all the material goods that we have today

59
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,520
is due to fossil fuels.

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,000
This has also framed the geography and, I would say, settlements of people,

61
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,240
as it is no longer necessary to have people in the fields growing fruit.

62
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,960
We have progressively shifted to industrial, then office jobs,

63
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,720
or tertiary jobs, so to say, that we have in cities.

64
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,240
We progressively went to a type of settlement where most people live in cities,

65
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
and actually you can observe that everywhere in the world,

66
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,760
the more energy per capita you have and the more people live in cities.

67
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:59,680
The modern urban world with people working in offices or in commercial buildings,

68
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:07,680
living at home and owning a car is basically the way of living that you have everywhere

69
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,640
when abundant energy comes in.

70
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,200
It's basically what happened everywhere.

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
And, of course, this comes with the price.

72
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,160
Actually, the first price that it comes with is that all these fossil fuels have changed the

73
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,920
composition of the atmosphere through their burning, and it has increased a natural effect

74
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:35,840
called the greenhouse effect that was discovered by a French two centuries ago, Joseph Fourier,

75
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,840
in 1824.

76
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,520
And this greenhouse effect is being increased or enhanced by all the extra CO2 that we pour

77
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,840
into the atmosphere, knowing that the CO2 is a very stable molecule because it's an oxide,

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,400
and oxides are very stable chemical compounds.

79
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,640
And it leads to a change of the climate system, a climate drift, so to say,

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
which is going to be an increasing burden.

81
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:08,400
And the other price that we have to pay is that all this, I would say, industrial civilization

82
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,440
rests on non-renewable resources that we have to use and destroy when we use them

83
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,760
more and more, fossil fuels, they need, we destroy them when we use them, but also metals.

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:29,040
Today, our modern civilization needs all the metals that we have found on Earth.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,760
The computer that I'm using right now and that you are using right now needs 40 to 60 different

86
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,040
metals to be manufactured.

87
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:49,520
So the civilization that we have built is increasingly complex and dependent on

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,760
non-natural resources that can be depleted.

89
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,640
So the two main challenges, I would say, the two main global limits that we face today

90
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:04,160
is a global limit regarding the environment that cannot accept all the waste that we pour

91
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:12,560
into it, CO2 being one of it, being one of the, I would say, the best documented and addressed

92
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:22,000
today, but there are many more, and an upstream bottleneck on non-renewable resources that we

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,440
would like to have more and more.

94
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,360
And it's not sure that we will have more.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
Actually regarding oil, it's almost sure that we will not have more and more.

96
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,920
And in a couple of years, we will have less and less.

97
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,840
Globally speaking, in the world.

98
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,960
So that's the challenge we address.

99
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,720
And one of the difficulties that comes with it is that very few people understand the challenge

100
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,480
because it is not something that you can get through the most common indicator that we use

101
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,200
every day, which is money.

102
00:07:52,640 --> 00:08:00,240
The challenge that I just evoked is not embedded into current prices because basically

103
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,840
natural assets have no price.

104
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,640
And so we cannot realize that there is a challenge through prices.

105
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:12,560
But it happens that the only quantitative indicator that we use every day is money.

106
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,720
You don't take your block pressure every day.

107
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,320
You don't measure the amount of CO2 that you put into the air every day.

108
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,600
You don't measure the mass of copper that you use every day.

109
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,920
I mean, the only thing that you count every day is money, basically.

110
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,840
And so the difficulty is that as the challenge is not embedded into prices,

111
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,000
it is very difficult for people that have not devoted their life to studying the challenge,

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,840
as I have done, to understand it easily.

113
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Magnifique, that was a better summary than I've ever done, I think,

114
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,480
even though we're telling the same story.

115
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,640
When was your red pill moment, Jean-Marc, when you first realized how central that

116
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,520
energy was to the entire civilization and our expectations and everything?

117
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,320
Actually, I had a collection of red pills, of small red pills.

118
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,440
My first red pill was when I realized the magnitude of the challenge regarding climate change.

119
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,280
Actually, historically, I came to climate change before coming to energy.

120
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:28,560
The way I got my revelation, so to say, is that at the end of the 90s,

121
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:38,480
I was working in the telecommunication sector, and it was the time where the operators were

122
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,600
very excited by the idea of developing remote activities.

123
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,680
It was the beginning of telework, remote learning, and all these things.

124
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,960
And I was as a basic consultant during business plans for the main French operator

125
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,040
in telecommunications, Orange, today, at the time it was France Telecom,

126
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,640
and studying the fact, well, looking at the fact that

127
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,560
home offices could spare people moving or could spare car commuting.

128
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:21,360
I came across the word greenhouse gases, and I asked myself, what is that?

129
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,080
So I began looking, so that was my first red pill moment.

130
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,600
I understood that we were changing the composition of the atmosphere, and that it could,

131
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
I would say, trigger a change of climate era in one century.

132
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,400
Whereas in the past, it was done in 10,000 years with people able to move around,

133
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
which is not the case today, because we have settled.

134
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:55,600
My second red pill moment was when I tried to understand what was causing this,

135
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,400
and the link between the way we live and energy.

136
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,360
And my second red pill moment was when I realized that actually,

137
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:14,080
energy or the increase of energy supply had been the main driver over a century, say,

138
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
that frayed all the countries in the world.

139
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,200
Basically, you give machines to a country, and the evolution is always the same.

140
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,560
People leave the fields, go to factories, then to sit, then to offices,

141
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,080
live in cities.

142
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,760
They are purchasing power increases, they get retirement, they get long studies,

143
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,560
they get vacations, they get their weekends, they work less in the week, they vote.

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,840
I mean, everything came in with energy.

145
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,560
And that was my second red pill moment, because then I asked myself,

146
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,000
where will the world go the day we have less and less energy?

147
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:56,000
Will we keep democracies, or will we have rights everywhere and social unrest?

148
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,840
Which is unfortunately happening here and there more and more.

149
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,480
Will we keep peace, or is something that won't happen?

150
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:14,480
How are we going to, in a way, become sober without the whole society collapsing?

151
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:23,520
I still haven't the complete answer, but that was my second red pill moment.

152
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,760
Then I had another red pill moment when I realized the way democracies operate.

153
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,560
And I realized that a fast reaction to that issue would not happen.

154
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,640
That was, I would say, a third red pill moment.

155
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,040
So I had at least three, and maybe through our discussion, I will discover that I have more.

156
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,320
Yeah, the room is full of red pills.

157
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
We actually have so much in common on how we see this.

158
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,280
So if I was an economist or a world leader listening to your summary,

159
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:03,680
I might say, yes, but it's technology that caused all the increase in population and the increase in

160
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,760
wealth and services and the increase in city and retirement and vacation.

161
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
It's human innovation that caused it.

162
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,520
Do you encounter that pushback, and how do you respond to it?

163
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:24,480
Well, it's an easy answer, because actually, to spread technology, you basically have to spread the

164
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,200
objects that embed the technology.

165
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:33,680
So you have to manufacture plenty of objects, and manufacturing plenty of objects per the name,

166
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,040
which is energy, because you need plenty of energy into the industrial system.

167
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
I can put it the other way around.

168
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,720
Tomorrow morning, you don't have much energy, and you can't manufacture cars anymore.

169
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,720
Even if you have brilliant engineers, how do you spread technical progress in cars?

170
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,120
If you can't manufacture cars, obviously you can't.

171
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,800
And if you can't manufacture cars that people can't use, because there is no energy to use the cars,

172
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,840
how do you spread technical progress in cars?

173
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,240
You can't.

174
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,360
So it's very easy to explain that actually spreading technical, finding something which is new

175
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,560
doesn't require much energy.

176
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,360
Actually, it requires a little energy, because it requires free time.

177
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:24,400
In the Middle Ages, people were busy feeling themselves, because it's the first need of humanity.

178
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,160
And once the day was over, and they had worked all day to feed themselves,

179
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,040
they had no spare time to find whatever the proton, or the neutron, or the electron,

180
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,720
or the way to conceive the electric energy.

181
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,640
One of the reasons why we have plenty of researchers today able to, and Mr. Musk and

182
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,360
hire plenty of engineers, is that precisely machines are growing the food for us.

183
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If we're a busy harvesting potatoes, we wouldn't do any research.

184
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,320
Wouldn't have the time to do so.

185
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,840
When you look at countries that are still very sober regarding their energy consumption in Africa,

186
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:07,920
for example, they do not have many engineers, and they don't have many researchers.

187
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,960
So it's also the result of abundant energy that we can have research and technology.

188
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,880
But to spread, again, technology, we need plenty of energy,

189
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,880
because we need to manufacture plenty of objects.

190
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:29,280
So there are a lot of very ambitious technological plans in the future,

191
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:39,040
such as net zero. And there are promises of decoupling or dematerializing GDP from energy

192
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,240
and materials. What are your thoughts on that?

193
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,800
So far, it never happened. Actually, 15 years ago, I began doing something very simple,

194
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,640
which is plotting the world GDP against the world energy consumption.

195
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,560
I've got data going up to 1965, and I was astonished to discover that I got almost a

196
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,640
straight line. So when you plot the world GDP in constant dollars against the world energy

197
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,120
consumption, which is actually the size of the active fleet of machines in the world,

198
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,360
that's what the energy consumption is, you get almost a straight line,

199
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,640
you have a little improvement of the energy efficiency every year.

200
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,640
So actually, it's not exactly a straight line, something which is slightly convex,

201
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,040
but you get almost a straight line. And the reason why is very simple, actually,

202
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,360
to have as long as the GDP counts the same thing, that is square feet of construction,

203
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,320
goods moving around, goods being manufactured, number of ships operating in the world, etc.

204
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:55,200
You have physical things. And in the physical world, you have rules that you cannot,

205
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,920
sorry for the repetition, overrule. I mean, like for example, to put a mass in motion,

206
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,440
you require a minimum energy, which is the mass times the square of the speed times one half.

207
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,600
And you cannot say it's one quarter, because it would be, I would save energy if it were one

208
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,120
quarter. So I'm going to vote at the Congress that it's one quarter, you can't do that.

209
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:26,640
It's always one half. So you have limits, you can near the limit, but you cannot overcome it.

210
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:35,760
I'm going to take another example. To go from iron ore to iron, you have to remove the oxygen

211
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,720
in the iron ore. Actually, iron ore is an iron oxide. The most common molecule in iron ore is

212
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:51,040
two atoms of iron for three atoms of oxygen. To remove the oxygen, you use carbon, coal,

213
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:59,040
actually, metallurgical coal. You need 1.5 atom of carbon to remove the three atoms of oxygen,

214
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:05,600
and it will never be one, and it will never be 0.8. It will always be 1.5. So in the physical

215
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:11,280
world, you have physical limits. And it's the reason why when you look at the energy consumption

216
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,440
per physical unit, per kilogram of steel, per kilogram of copper, the improvement actually

217
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,960
is very low. It's very slow. It doesn't go fast, and you have an absolute limit that you cannot

218
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:31,920
overcome. So in the future, we might even degrade the energy efficiency of the industry,

219
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:37,680
because the concentration of copper in the copper ore, for example, decreases with time,

220
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,720
which means that you need more and more energy to get 1 kilogram of copper. And so at the

221
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,600
certain point with time, you will not have an improvement of the energy efficiency of mining

222
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,240
copper, but you will have a degradation of the energy efficiency of mining copper.

223
00:18:53,280 --> 00:19:00,800
So but again, when you look at the past, you have there is no decoupling at the world level.

224
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,840
You have a slight decoupling in some given countries, but that's thanks to trade,

225
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,040
because you have the added value in the country, and the industrial process that or the physical

226
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:19,280
flow that provides this added value, which is outside the country. So it's an illusion. When

227
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,760
you look at the world as a whole, you have no decoupling in the past, and there is no major

228
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,880
reason that you can get a decoupling in the future. Jean-Marc, have you ever watched one of my lectures

229
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:39,200
or any of my videos? I confess that I have not done so recently. Well, then I'm very happy,

230
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,040
because you are telling my story, and we've never met and never watched each other's videos,

231
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:50,400
which means the story is robust. I feel like I found a brother from another mother. I mean,

232
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:57,360
I say these same things over independent research for the last 20 years. And I just

233
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:06,320
question why it is that so few people have connected these dots. And I suspect that one

234
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,480
reason is that the total, as you said earlier, the total amount of energy available to society

235
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,560
is increased every year, and that is hiding all of the future assumptions and plans just

236
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:28,960
implicitly assume that will continue. So they miss the centrality of energy abundant and cheap

237
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,560
are contributing to our society. Why do you think you and I and many others have been

238
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,480
talking about this for 20 years, and it is still not, well, maybe in France it has, but

239
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:48,000
elsewhere in the world, this is still a narrative of technology and money. And energy materials

240
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:55,840
are out in the distance in the explanatory stories. You're geographically closer to the answer than I

241
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:02,400
am. I believe that it's a consequence of the University of Chicago. That's where I went to

242
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:12,320
graduate school. Yeah, okay. Basically, it goes back to what I said earlier. Many people in the

243
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:18,640
economic world believe that physical constraints are embedded into prices. And one of the things

244
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,400
that they believe is that there is an elasticity between prices and volumes. So that if you near

245
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,320
a limit, you will see it into prices. And if you don't see anything into prices is that you are far

246
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,160
from the limits. I will explain in a couple of seconds why it is false for commodities that are

247
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:42,640
essential to our modern economy. For oil or steel, for example, it is false. I can explain that

248
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:50,720
very easily. There is no elasticity. And that's one of the reasons why. Of course, and it goes back

249
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,600
to framing. Actually, it's not the fault of the University of Chicago because before that it was

250
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:02,880
the fault of French and English thinkers, earlier thinkers, early thinkers, sorry, of the classical

251
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:09,680
economy. Two centuries ago, basically, the classical economist said, in the world, we are

252
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,880
going to count what is the limiting factor of production, which is the economic science. Basically,

253
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,880
it is addressing the limiting factors of production. And at the time, two centuries ago,

254
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,080
basically, the economy was still a lot centered on agriculture. There was a little industry,

255
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:37,120
but basically. And what they said is that there is plenty of land, plenty of resources. We don't

256
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,920
lack iron ore. We don't lack coal. The only thing that we can lack is human labor and human capital.

257
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,720
So the only thing that we are going to count is human labor, which is a way, a kind of energy,

258
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:59,520
but it's a slight part of the energy that we can get. And human capital, which is also a limiting

259
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:07,120
factor, but there are plenty other limiting factors among natural capital. If you are a fisherman,

260
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,600
you need a natural capital, which is fish. You don't only need human capital, which is a boat,

261
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:20,400
and you don't need only sailors. You also need, particularly if you're a modern fisherman,

262
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:27,920
a little oil or a little diesel oil to put into the engine. So basically, and what they have done

263
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:33,760
is that they have invented that technological progress, which is, for example, the solo residue

264
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:42,560
in Solo's vision, which is the total productivity of factor. If you look at Copto Glass, etc.

265
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:49,200
So they invented that term, which cannot be predicted, which can only explain,

266
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,680
exhaust what happened, which is fantastic, which was called technological progress. And which,

267
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,040
actually, when you look carefully at things, is energy machines and natural resources. That's

268
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:07,920
what actually it is. But as it is not explicit, people stick to prices, and they believe that

269
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,840
with prices, you can explain all what happens to the productive system. Now, why is it false that

270
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,440
we have no elasticity between prices and volumes regarding oil or steel, for example? It's because

271
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,200
these commodities are essential to modern economy. If you produce less oil in the world, if you have

272
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,600
less oil, you will have less cars, less trucks, less planes, and less boats that can operate.

273
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,480
Therefore, your economy will shrink a little. And if the economy shrinks a little, people earn less,

274
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,080
because basically, the revenues are equal to the production. That's basic macroeconomic

275
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,920
formula. So if people earn less and have less money, and you have less oil to offer them,

276
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,760
you don't know whether the new equilibrium price of oil will be higher or lower than the former

277
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,560
price. And actually, when you look at past prices, there is no clear relationship.

278
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:06,480
With less oil, you can have prices that are lower, prices that are higher, you can get everything.

279
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,160
Same thing for steel. The modern world fully relies on steel. If you have less steel,

280
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:17,200
it's an essential commodity for the economy. So if you produce less steel, you will destroy

281
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,000
a little part of the economy. Therefore, producing less, people earn less, and then again, the new

282
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,600
equilibrium price of steel has no reason to be higher or lower than the previous one. So there

283
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,600
is no elasticity between prices and volumes for communities that are essential to the functioning

284
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,560
of the economy. If you take a commodity which is non-essential, like handbags, for example,

285
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,920
if you produce less handbags, of course, it will not destroy the economy. You have this,

286
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:50,480
people have the same purchasing power, only you have less handbags. And so the price of the handbag

287
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:59,760
goes up. So that's okay. But this relationship, it doesn't apply to commodities that are essential

288
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:09,760
to framing the modern economy. Which is why, for example, you won't see oil depletion coming through

289
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,880
oil prices going forever up. You will see them with GDP going forever down.

290
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:25,600
That's the way you will see it. But nominal prices. And today, as economists have never looked at the

291
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,640
relationship between energy and GDP, when the GDP goes down, it's the fault of bankers, people that

292
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,640
don't want to work, lazy, whatever, but they never see energy in the picture.

293
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:48,000
So there's a biophysically economist who used to be on our advisory board called Reiner Kumo,

294
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:58,880
who explained the solo residual is almost all energy. And I think if we did it on a global

295
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:05,040
basis, it would be like over 90% of it. I think his numbers were 60 some percent. But yeah,

296
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,560
excellent. So what are your thoughts? You mentioned money and GDP. What are your opinions on finance

297
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,920
and quantitative easing as adding false or temporary wealth to the economy in the last couple

298
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,160
decades? And how does that affect some people's claims that we're decoupling energy from GDP?

299
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,640
I am not an expert on quantitative easing, but one of the conclusions that I've come to

300
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:41,920
is that it led to an inflation of assets. Actually, there is an old theory that says that when you

301
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:48,880
create money in excess, compared to the physical possibilities of the economy to produce something,

302
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:56,880
it leads to inflation. Actually, what happened during the last 20 years is that creating money

303
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:06,960
didn't lead to inflation in common goods, but it led to inflation in assets, real estate, stocks, etc.

304
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:13,280
So that's what happened basically. And that inflation of assets is not fully corrected

305
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:21,280
in deflating all that you count in the GDP. For example, if you have a square meter, sorry,

306
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:29,360
a square foot in a building, which costs twice the price, you will need a mortgage,

307
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:37,200
which is twice the amount. And you will count the production in banks as twice the previous

308
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,560
production. You will not deflate that production on the basis that it's always a square foot

309
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,640
it is physically still the same goods, only costs twice the price. And so you have no reason

310
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:58,080
to count twice the bank added value. And you have that same thing for the stock market.

311
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,760
If stocks go up, you will not deflate that saying, okay, it's always a stock, it's always the same

312
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,240
company. There is no reason to count it for twice or 10 times the price. And I have never

313
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,760
had the opportunity to make precise calculations to see what would have,

314
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,520
how the GDP would have evolved if we had discounted, so to say, the inflation of assets

315
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,480
from the GDP. But my belief is that it would have removed something, a little something.

316
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,360
And the other thing that we should have removed from the GDP basically is the debt,

317
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,920
because if you increase the GDP that you count today, through increasing the debt that you

318
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:52,480
have to reimburse tomorrow, normally, you should have an accounting closer to a certain liability

319
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:59,600
accounting than to a P&L accounting, which is what we do. So you should count something for

320
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:06,720
the creation of debt that you should deduct from today's GDP. And that correction also has never

321
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,760
been made. And the level of debt has never been as high, well, actually for the last century,

322
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,720
I mean, it's never been as high as today. Except for the Second World War.

323
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,520
It's even higher than that now as a percentage. But all that debt, Jean-Marc, when it's called in,

324
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:31,680
when it's created to be paid down, is a claim on energy. So all the debts that exist in the

325
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,400
world when they're eventually paid down, and we don't have that amount of energy. So I think

326
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,720
this one piece alone is being completely missed by the financial markets, in my opinion.

327
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,120
Well, my belief is that it will end through inflation or default,

328
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:54,640
or a mixture of the two. I, of course, have a preference for inflation because it's softer.

329
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,640
But obviously, we are building a kind of policy pyramid, and we all know how it ends.

330
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:09,760
But I agree. If you need extra GDP in the future to reimburse the debt, it means that you need

331
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:17,280
extra energy. And you don't see how it fits if we have less and less energy in the future.

332
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:24,000
So temporarily, we can print more money, which is a facsimile for more energy,

333
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,040
but it just extracts the existing energy we have faster.

334
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,120
I am not sure that it had a major effect on extraction of energy. It did have,

335
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:47,760
in the US, a significant effect on the sharehold industry, because during between 2010 and 2018,

336
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:56,000
during the share boom, as you probably know, share operators didn't earn a single back.

337
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:03,840
Actually, they were all losing money. And they were also building a kind of policy pyramid.

338
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,920
They were burning cash and refinancing themselves with new stock and new debt.

339
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:20,080
Until one year before COVID, the financial sector said, now, now, end of the game,

340
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:25,920
we want our money back. And actually, the only way to get the money back is to stop drilling all

341
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:33,600
the time. Because with drilling all the time, you have huge capex and you just burn cash,

342
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,840
I mean, you cannot earn money. And the paradox of sharehold is that you can earn money only if you

343
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,520
do not increase production too fast, or if you do not increase it at all. But quantitative easing

344
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:55,520
did favor that movement, the extraction of sharehold. It did have an effect.

345
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,960
But after shale oil, there's nothing left except for oil shale, which is basically uncooked

346
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:07,760
rock with oil in it. So this is, that's not going to work.

347
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:16,000
Sorry, at the SHIP project, which is an NGO that I chair in France, we have done a thorough analysis

348
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:22,320
with the data coming from Reichstadt Energy. We had access to the full database of all the

349
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,880
oil fields in the world for a very minimum price. And we published, I think there was an English

350
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:38,880
version, our research on the projections that we make only under geological constraints,

351
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,400
we do not mention above ground constraints, political pressure, climate, whatever.

352
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:52,720
On the perspective of the 16 top suppliers of Europe, that includes US,

353
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,720
which happened to be the 16 top producers in the world except Canada, which is a significant one,

354
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,040
and Brazil. And the result of our work is that the production, the combined production of these

355
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:13,200
16 countries should be divided by two between now and 2015, including sharehold and including

356
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:25,360
Tassen. So 27 years from now, cut in half. By 2050, the combined production of these 16

357
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:35,600
top suppliers of Europe, which includes all the Middle East, Russia, all the US, Mexico,

358
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,480
all the 16 top producers in the world, but Canada and Brazil, the production should be

359
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,640
divided by two, including sharehold. That's almost best case, unless there's some new technology,

360
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,840
because it doesn't account for geopolitics or climate inability to get water to process the

361
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:05,200
mining or any any other complexity problems or things like that. I would say it's a no crisis

362
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,200
scenario. Yeah, I think that's plausible. I would expect my numbers might be a little bit higher,

363
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,280
but in that ballpark. So on that note, Jean-Marc, my personal stance, and I expect you would agree

364
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,560
that on a grand scale, climate change is the most existential issue that humanity faces this century.

365
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,520
However, you and I both believe that fossils are going to become economically unavailable

366
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,280
sooner than our cultures are planning for. That eliminates a lot of the more extreme

367
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,000
climate scenarios that some reports predict. What are your thoughts on that?

368
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,960
What it excludes in my view is the most extreme temperature increase coming from greenhouse gases,

369
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:02,880
but it doesn't exclude consequences much more unpleasant than what we today believe,

370
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:10,240
coming from the scenarios that remain plausible with the amount of fossil fuels that we can access

371
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:18,880
if I develop a little bit. I do believe that the higher end of the bracket regarding scenarios,

372
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:26,160
which is emissions, growing and growing during the 21st century is plausible, because my belief is

373
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,360
that we will experience some kind of slow collapse before the end of the century, preventing the

374
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:40,960
economy from growing and so preventing emissions from growing. So the scenario which is a healthy

375
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:50,400
economy and healthier and healthier economy becoming bigger and bigger until 2100 and

376
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,360
powered by fossil fuels is something that I don't believe possible. I don't deem it is physically

377
00:36:55,360 --> 00:37:08,320
possible. What is possible is that we get a peak fossil sometime around 2050, 2060 or so,

378
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:18,640
but that would be enough to trigger a three degrees plus scenario. What I want to elaborate

379
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,720
is that the consequences of a three degrees plus scenario might be much, much more ample

380
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:32,720
than what we believe today, because there are plenty of processes with threshold effects

381
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,280
in the world, and basically we discovered them when it's too late. I will give a couple of

382
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,520
examples. 10 years ago, I had never heard of the possible collapse of the western Antarctic ice

383
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:54,720
sheet, which is today considered possible, starting from 1.5 degrees of global warming.

384
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,760
10 years ago, I had not heard of the possible complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet

385
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,040
in a couple of centuries, of course, which is something which is today considered possible,

386
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:16,240
not certain, but possible. 10 years ago, I had not heard of the possibility of the whole Amazon

387
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,600
forest turning into a dry forest or even a savannah, which is something which is today

388
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:31,520
considered possible, et cetera, et cetera. Basically, and I remember that 20 years ago,

389
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:42,640
I did some kind of TV show in France, and we elaborated a false weather forecast for

390
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:52,240
2019, and the temperature that we mentioned was 40 degrees Celsius, which is something that we get

391
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:01,120
today each summer in France. Basically, my belief is that we should not be reassured

392
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:09,120
by that. The higher end of the warming is not possible, but the higher end of the consequences

393
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:17,040
that we get for a given warming today will be overcome. The reason why is that the models

394
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,760
that go from a global temperature increase to the consequences in a given sector,

395
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,320
being the possible dismantling of an ice cap, or the evolution of yields regarding maize or rise,

396
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,720
are models that are built with the past variability, and they do not embed the

397
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,000
possible future of variability. And some recent research has been published in nature

398
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,880
saying that if we increased a lot the variability in the future of climate parameters,

399
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,160
we get damage which is much, much higher, but if we do not do that.

400
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,680
I totally agree with you. Yeah, we don't have enough to meet the high threshold,

401
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,640
but we have plenty to have a disaster in the climate. So I have so many questions for you.

402
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,640
Let me just keep firing because you are giving succinct and very articulate answers,

403
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,760
not in your native language, by the way, so thank you for that.

404
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:27,280
So a main news story in France, kind of ongoing, has been protests and unrest over the raising of

405
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,760
the retirement age and the threshold for pension fund access. Do you think that this connects back

406
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,200
to energy scarcity, and do you think we'll have more of this type of response, or do the French

407
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:47,200
just have a certain proclivity for civil unrest? Well, without the two. We like to complain,

408
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:58,480
which is a national sport here, to complain, but the fact is that we today have retirement

409
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,600
thanks to abundant energy. I mean, two centuries ago, there was no retirement.

410
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,880
Actually, it's not true. Retirement was invented by Colbert four centuries ago,

411
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,720
and he did that for the Royal Navy. And at the time, there were 20,000 sailors,

412
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,360
and you could get retirement when you turn 60, and believe me, in 1600 something,

413
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,880
turning 60, which means surviving Scorbert and adverse fire.

414
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,960
I mean, he didn't make a major risk with the budget, our friend Colbert.

415
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,600
But thanks to energy now, we have so much production given by machines that we can feed

416
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:54,800
and provide clothes and housing and cars and everything to people that work, in quote,

417
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,520
which is giving orders to machines today, working, and people that do not work,

418
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,760
but some of them physically do exactly the same thing. You see, for example, today,

419
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,640
I'm supposed to work. I'm a consultant, I'm sitting behind an office, and I work. What is

420
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,360
working for me talking to you? Is that work? It is not work. I mean, if I, if in a couple of hours,

421
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,360
I will talk to somebody else doing exactly the same thing, sitting on a chair,

422
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:23,840
will not, will not be through a computer, and it will not be work. It will be later. I mean,

423
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,320
what is the difference in physical terms? No difference. So what we call work today

424
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:33,760
for plenty of people is something that middle-aged peasants would have called leisure,

425
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,720
sitting on a chair and talking, or sitting on a chair and typing on the, on the, on the, on the

426
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,600
on the keypad of a, on the type pad, sorry, of a computer. Well, okay, big deal. It is not work.

427
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,920
So retirement is actually a gift of abundant energy. You have no retirement in countries

428
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,800
that are very sober regarding their energy consumption. And so of course, unfortunately,

429
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,360
I have to say the long-term trend is that in the future, it will be harder and harder to retire.

430
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:12,240
So building on that, let me ask you a difficult question. I frequently cite that a barrel of

431
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:18,160
oil is worth around five years of human labor. You've made similar statements,

432
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:27,360
including that we've essentially replaced slave labor with, with fossil fuels. So if energy supply

433
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:32,480
is going to contract, it's not, it's my, it's my, it's my order of magnitude. I've got exactly the

434
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:38,960
same order of magnitude. Yes. Well, it's five years of work. Yeah. Of hard or very hard work.

435
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,240
Yeah. Very hard work. Yes. Well, it's the actual math is around 12 years, but humans are more

436
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,280
efficient with directing muscle labor to actual work. So you have to handicap it, but it's around

437
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,920
four and a half, five years. So, so you just suggested that of the 16 exporting countries

438
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,720
that Europe imports oil from, they'll be cut in half their production by 2050 plus or minus.

439
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,400
So if we contract energy supply, we're con, we're also GDP and jobs are also going to shrink. So do

440
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:17,680
you think it's likely or possible that we see a resurgence in things like slavery as fossil

441
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,040
energy availability declines and, and do you have hopes that we can avoid such a scenario?

442
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:35,520
It's my fear. My fear is that relationships between humans will become, I would say,

443
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:45,920
harder than they were, but we'll have more. I don't know how the expression in English

444
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:56,000
uphold the force. We'll have tensions between humans and brutal force

445
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:04,640
will be more important than, than, than it was. Of course, I'm not sure that we'll have less,

446
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:14,320
less work. We might have less jobs or less revenues. But, but when we had no machines,

447
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,400
we worked harder. So I do not know exactly how it's going to recompose. I mean, but

448
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:30,720
the main ideas are we'll work, we'll have more hard work, and we'll earn less, basically,

449
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:39,360
because what energy did is triggering the exact opposite, working less, and, and, and earning more.

450
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,520
That's what I refer to as the great simplification, the name of this podcast,

451
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,320
based on Tainter's premise of complexification required energy.

452
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:58,480
If, if it's possible, because you see two centuries ago, the world economy relied on

453
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:11,920
only nine metals. It relied on iron, copper, zinc, tin, lead, and a couple of them more.

454
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,280
Today, you do not have a single element of the table of Mandelaev that doesn't have an industrial

455
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:29,120
application, not one. And you and I, we depend on all these 92 elements, because, for example,

456
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:38,320
you depend as I depend on, on the digital system, which by itself requires 60 to 70 different

457
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,360
elements. Today, there is no single company that can operate within, within an information system.

458
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,960
No one. I mean, if you go back to paper sheets and pencils, you cannot operate any company today.

459
00:46:52,480 --> 00:47:01,920
We, so basically, in simplifying the present world is going to be extremely hard, extremely hard.

460
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,680
So you're getting at complexity, which I refer to as one of the big four risks that we face.

461
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:16,000
I consider them to be the financial system, geopolitics, complexity, and the social contract.

462
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,720
Not energy per se, but it's the, it's the change from abundant energy to flat or declining that

463
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:32,560
will trigger those other, those other things. So you've got, in Europe, a real-time trial of this,

464
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:39,360
of sorts going on right now because of the Russian situation in Ukraine, in your experience in

465
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,680
France. What if people's response has been, especially last winter, to increasing prices

466
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:54,160
in Europe? Has it created stronger community cohesion and a return to relying on social

467
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:59,600
capital? Or has it caused more division over scarcity? Or what's been your, your kind of

468
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:09,200
trial run? Basically, in France, it has triggered very high prices of natural gas

469
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:18,400
and energy and electricity, sorry. And it has triggered significant savings by people. So they

470
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:27,840
heated less. They use less electricity. A number of companies and mostly energy-intensive industries

471
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:36,320
produce less. That's basically what happened. I have not felt a major change in social structures

472
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:41,440
or the way people behave. Actually, it has nothing to do with what happened during the COVID, for

473
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:52,560
example. Last year, nothing much happened. The political response has been significant.

474
00:48:53,600 --> 00:49:02,000
And now the word sobriety is everywhere in political speeches. That is something significant.

475
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:09,760
What does the word sobriety mean? It means, actually, my own classification of energy savings

476
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:18,160
includes three, well counts three terms. The first one is efficiency. Efficiency is getting

477
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,600
the same service while using less energy, either to manufacture an object or to use it.

478
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:31,760
The second term that I use is sobriety, which is deliberately waiving a service of good

479
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:39,680
in order to save resources or energy. For example, I was using a car, I use a bike,

480
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:47,360
or I commute by train. This is sobriety. And poverty is exactly the same physical

481
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:54,400
item than sobriety. Only you didn't ask for it. So sobriety is having no longer

482
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:02,560
the economic means to own a car or to use it. And so you have to use a bike or to go by train.

483
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:09,200
But you didn't want it. My belief is that today what happens in France is actually poverty.

484
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:15,120
People didn't ask for it and they have to organize themselves differently.

485
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:24,720
But the government, no government can use the word poverty. So they use the word sobriety,

486
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:32,160
which is giving the impression that we do it in an organized and deliberate way.

487
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:40,640
It gives people agency to have sobriety instead of poverty. So I think the distinction between

488
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:47,520
those two is really important and clever. Do you think that individuals listening to this program

489
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:56,000
or cultures, nations, can choose sobriety before it is forced upon us as poverty?

490
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:07,440
I believe no. One of my friends with whom I work in France says you have the strategy of your sets.

491
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:20,000
So it basically goes the other way around. So my belief is that the best that you can hope

492
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:29,440
is that the day you have a shock or a crash, then you can pull out of the drawer a sobriety plan

493
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:36,560
that was framed or conceived before you had the shock or the crash. But I don't believe that

494
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:45,600
democracies will spontaneously implement a decrease of their production and their consumption.

495
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:52,160
But I do believe that they can decide to go that direction the day they realize that anyway,

496
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:59,040
they do not have the choice. Again, because that's the strategy of your set. And if I can be a little

497
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:05,920
bit rude, because I understand that I'm talking mostly to US auditors, I believe that it's going

498
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:12,720
to be even more complicated in the US, which is the land of plenty, which was built on tremendous

499
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:20,080
resources, tremendous land, and basically through getting rid of all the previous inhabitants and

500
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:29,120
animals that were there. So the country with no limits by excellence is the US.

501
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,480
And so it's going to be even harder in the US than it is in Europe.

502
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:42,640
Well, let me ask you about that, because Europe will arguably have to face sobriety

503
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:49,520
and poverty before the US does, because we still produce 90-some percent of our own energy.

504
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:56,560
Will that be a blessing or a curse? Will Europe have to suffer the pain first, but

505
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,280
they will reorganize in different ways that will ultimately be more helpful? What do you think?

506
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:12,480
I think it can be both, and history will tell. I don't know. I mean, it's a blessing in the way that

507
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:18,240
what I hope is that we use the residual fossil fuels that we have at hand

508
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,440
to build a world that can operate the best it can without fossil fuels.

509
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:30,560
It is not something that people understand clearly today. It is an idea which is making

510
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:36,800
its way, but slowly. And of course, I believe that in the US, you are

511
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,600
farther from that idea, because you still have plenty of resources.

512
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:52,800
And also, I won't, you will not learn with me that actually your country is two countries.

513
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,440
You have the US of the coast and the US of the middle.

514
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:03,760
And actually, it's two different countries. And the reaction to what I'm explaining right now

515
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:12,160
is totally different, whether you are talking to Massachusetts or California or Wisconsin

516
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:21,200
or Ohio. So I'm actually, again, totally aligned with you on this. I don't think we're going to

517
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,640
change until we're forced to. So the best thing that people listening to this and you and I are

518
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:35,600
working on is building those plans for when that moment comes. So you, among other projects,

519
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,400
you run the shift project, which has plans for transforming the French economy.

520
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,480
Can you give a brief overview of what you're doing and what your hopes are there?

521
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:59,760
Yes. That work started during the COVID. Actually, when the COVID stroke, it was clear for me

522
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,880
that a number of companies would ask for help. They would say, okay, we cannot operate anymore.

523
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,640
Give us some money or we'll have to fire, we'll go bankrupt and we'll fire everyone,

524
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:17,120
which in France is much more drama than in the US. And so I thought at the time,

525
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,800
one of the things that we should try to design is the counterparts that the state should ask

526
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,960
to these companies before lending them a helping hand. So, okay, we are going to sign the check,

527
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:39,200
but we asked you to do this and that regarding being able to operate in a world with less

528
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:47,280
fossil fuels. And then we realized pretty quickly that our work would never be ready

529
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:53,760
before the first checks would be signed. And so we said, okay, we are going to do something

530
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,720
slightly different. We are going to design a plan which is how we should reorganize the economy

531
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:13,440
if we want to align ourselves with a decrease of 5% premiere of the greenhouse gases emissions in the

532
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:21,520
world. And this is called the plan transformation of the economy franÃ§ais planned to transform

533
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,920
the French economy. And actually, it's an attempt to do economy without talking euros or dollars

534
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,960
at first, but we talk physical flows. So basically what we do is that we look at the physical flows

535
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:42,640
that frame the economy, the construction sector, the automotive industry, the way we grow food and

536
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,480
transform it, etc. And we say if we want to decrease that by 5%, sorry, if we want to decrease the

537
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,360
greenhouse gases emissions by 5% per year, what does it mean regarding the number of cars that

538
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:01,360
we manufacture given the energy efficiency of manufacturing one car, the number of houses that

539
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:08,800
we build, the number of people that can move around in cars and trucks, etc. And the number of

540
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:17,840
people that are employed in the different sectors. So it's planned to transform the system without

541
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:24,880
saying we should invest money here, finance such a sector with so many billion dollars here, etc.

542
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:33,520
Do not talk money at all. And it's a method in a way to address the economy as a physical system.

543
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,920
And we had a huge success in France, because we published a book which was called the plan

544
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:49,680
transformation of the economy franÃ§ais. And we sold over 1100,000 copies, which in France

545
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:58,000
is a huge success for a book for an essay. In order to give you a comparison, it happens that

546
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,400
a graphic novel that I wrote with Christophe Blain, which is called the world without end,

547
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:12,880
the Mont-Saint-FranÃ§ was in 2022, the number one book in France, the most sold book in France,

548
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:21,520
and we sold a little bit over 500,000 copies. So 100,000 copies for an essay on decarbonizing

549
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:30,400
the French economy, it's a huge success. I mean, in our wildest dreams, we wouldn't have come up

550
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:37,040
with such a figure. And plenty of top executives have read it, plenty of politicians have read it,

551
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:46,640
and I believe that we have oriented a little the debate in France on the way to decarbonize

552
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,160
the economy with this work and with this book. So it's a method, again, and we could apply it to

553
00:58:52,160 --> 00:59:01,280
the US, exactly the same method. It's how do we orient the physical flows of economy if we want

554
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,640
to decrease the greenhouse gases emissions by X percent per year.

555
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:12,400
So in the global north, I suspect that the country that you live in, France,

556
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:19,280
may be closer as a culture to understanding climate energy constraints, partially due to

557
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,680
your book, you said 500,000 copies, partially there's this

558
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:32,400
Collapsology, you know, subculture there, French President Macron periodically voices comments

559
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,920
that the best times are behind us economically. You know, are these books and discussions

560
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,640
allowing France to be ahead of the curve, discussing limits to growth, sobriety,

561
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,800
and is that good or bad? What is your thought? Again, we have the strategy of our sets.

562
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:59,680
What is our sets? It's our history. For no country, we have experienced hunger,

563
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:09,680
wars, physical limits of all kinds, and so just as Great Britain, just as Scandinavian countries,

564
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:16,960
just as Switzerland. So the only countries that had an easy life in the ancient world were Italy

565
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:25,040
and Spain, which are countries today that I would say not, they are not as comfortable as

566
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:31,360
countries that are farther up north with large scale organizations designed to face a constraint.

567
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,560
And so it's only the result of our history. When you look at other countries in the world

568
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:45,440
that resemble us, you have Japan, a country with no resources, very strong technical culture,

569
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,480
and which is also very conscious of the limits of the physical limits today.

570
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,560
And you have, in a way, China. Same thing. I mean, China is a North country that has experienced

571
01:00:56,560 --> 01:01:04,240
also hunger, wars, physical limits, and which is also a country of engineers historically.

572
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:12,320
In ancient China, the top class people were the engineers able to operate all the hydraulic system

573
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:21,600
feeding the rice paddies, well, or supplying the rice paddies. So all these countries have

574
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:28,560
things in common, which countries that have been recently occupied and which are very,

575
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:37,440
I would say, very big, vast countries with plenty of resources are not like the US,

576
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:44,480
like Brazil, like Canada, in a way like Russia, what we could call anti-countries,

577
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,000
while these countries are not so comfortable with global physical limits.

578
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:56,880
So in preparing for this interview, Jean-Marc, I was reading about you yesterday,

579
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:05,360
and you are increasingly being called a guru and a most influential public intellectual

580
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:13,200
in French media. I'm just curious, how are you navigating, describing,

581
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:21,840
our extremely challenging biophysical reality in a political system that in France and globally

582
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:30,880
rewards simplicity and feel-good messaging, where your message is counter to that? How are you finding

583
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:38,320
that? What has changed the relationship between an individual and the population today is social

584
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:45,600
networks. My faith would probably have been very different in a world with only media,

585
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:54,720
because I would have, in that world, without pleasing the journalist, nobody would have heard of me.

586
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,840
In the modern world, with the social media, you can put online videos, you can put online

587
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:08,320
long videos or conferences, you can put online explanations, I used to maintain now, it's a

588
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:18,560
bit old-fashioned, a website to vulgarize energy and climate change issues. And the reason why

589
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:25,840
the graphic novel that I mentioned before was a success is that before that, the online videos

590
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:32,080
of the course that I teach at Mint Paris was already a success. And the reason why is that,

591
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:40,480
well, success by French figures. I think I went up to one million views or something like that.

592
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:49,440
And it was a success because people appreciate consistency. Actually, I believe that the reason

593
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:57,600
why I have had a small success is that I offered to a number of people that were

594
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:05,040
vaguely conscious of something, but couldn't put a name on it, all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle

595
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:12,400
that they can assemble and get a clear picture of. So I provide them with some kind of comfort

596
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:16,400
of not being so stupid because they felt that something was

597
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:24,320
not corresponding to the explanations they got elsewhere, basically. And

598
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,160
the fact that I have a base in a way that I can address directly through social media,

599
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:42,000
like for example today, I write a daily post on LinkedIn, I publish videos online once in a while,

600
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:50,000
et cetera, makes it so that my reputation cannot be made only by the media.

601
01:04:52,320 --> 01:05:00,400
Whereas in the past, you were fully dependent on what the media said of you for your reputation.

602
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:09,360
Now it's a little bit different. So the relationship that I have with the press

603
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:20,560
is, I would say, in between a distant relationship. Whenever I get an invitation,

604
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:24,640
I don't say yes all the time. Actually, I say yes one time out of 10 maybe.

605
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:33,840
And I don't feel like I desperately need them. And actually, my day-to-day job doesn't evolve

606
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:40,800
me. My day-to-day job is to run a company and to chair an NGO. It has nothing to do with the media.

607
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:50,960
So when I'm labeled a guru of whatever, the best thing that I can do is not respond.

608
01:05:51,840 --> 01:06:03,280
It's not responding. And if some people mention it to me, then I answer saying what I think of it.

609
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:14,960
Well, I think people not only value consistency, but they value truth and authenticity. And I suspect,

610
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:23,680
I don't know, but I suspect as events get closer, as we have more expensive and less available energy,

611
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:31,200
that the conventional media will not be able to tell the full biophysical truth that you and I are

612
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:40,800
telling. It's just too threatening to the general public. So the role that you and others are playing

613
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:48,720
is very interesting in informing and hopefully inspiring society towards change. Do you agree?

614
01:06:49,520 --> 01:07:00,640
Partially only because I think that what the press can do is describe simultaneously

615
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:09,680
a problem and the way to react to the problem. Just saying over and over and over that there is a

616
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:16,560
problem is something indeed that they don't appreciate much. And actually, when you look at

617
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:24,480
the way the vulgarized climate change, they have selected information which is distant in space

618
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:32,240
and in time. Basically, the information that they like the most is what will happen in 2100

619
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:40,560
and the global temperature increase. So this is distant in time, 2100, and it is distant in

620
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:45,040
space because it's a global temperature and you don't feel a global temperature and I don't feel

621
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:50,000
a global temperature. I mean, I feel the temperature which is right now in the room where I am and you

622
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,960
feel the temperature which is right now in the room where you are. And neither of us feels the

623
01:07:55,040 --> 01:08:03,360
average temperature. It doesn't exist for our senses. But what the media don't speak of much,

624
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:07,760
and there was an article published also in the scientific literature pointing that

625
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:16,720
a couple of months ago, there very much relay information that pertains to things that are

626
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:23,520
not so distant in the future and pretty local. Like for example, what will be the flow of the

627
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:29,920
color of the river in tenures and the consequences that it can have on crops. That is something

628
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:38,400
that they do not give much audience to this kind of scientific work, even though you have plenty

629
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:49,680
of scientific publications that pertain to this kind of issue. So what they like again, the media

630
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:55,760
is talking of an issue when you have the beginning of a solution or the beginning of a way to react

631
01:08:55,760 --> 01:09:02,640
or to act facing the issue. And this is why I've set up the SHIFT project. The SHIFT project is

632
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:10,400
actually fully devoted to proposing ways to confront the issue and to react to the issue

633
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:17,840
and to organize ourselves with the issue. So it also tries to provide hope in a way.

634
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:25,440
And then you can get more audience on both the issue and the way to react to the issue.

635
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:32,240
The leading economic paper in France, which is called MESICO, gives much more audience

636
01:09:32,240 --> 01:09:39,120
to environmental issues now than it did just two years ago. But the reason why is that they

637
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:46,640
right now also have many stories to tell regarding companies or action which is being taken

638
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:54,160
to face the issue. So that's the reason why. And do I believe that France is at the forefront?

639
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:04,160
I would say in a bunch which is globally very late, the answer is yes. So what I believe is that

640
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:12,400
in a collection of countries that are globally extremely late, France is a little bit less late

641
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:18,880
than the others. We have done a number of things that were done for the first time.

642
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:25,840
Well, I mean, you and I have been telling variations of this story publicly for 20 years.

643
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:33,680
And I feel that the world events have caught up to the story that we're telling. What's your

644
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:39,680
experience? Are people obviously because of your popularity, people are now more receptive to this?

645
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,440
I believe it goes the other way around. I believe I am popular because people realized.

646
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:57,520
People realized. I'm surfing on the wave. Yes, because we have heat waves, because we have

647
01:10:58,160 --> 01:11:04,480
prices of gasoline going up and down and up very often. Because we have, I mean, yes.

648
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:12,240
Yeah. Because people realized. So, and for example, let me take another example,

649
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:21,920
which is the opinion that French have on nuclear energy. It gained recently 20 percentage points

650
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:29,280
in support. So about 50% of the French population supported nuclear energy two years ago.

651
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:38,080
One third were against and 15% said they had no opinion. It jumped from 50 to 70% in two years.

652
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:45,040
So you could say, okay, that's chocolate, this is false. But actually, it evolved exactly the

653
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,920
same way in all other European countries. Well, that could be because of Russia and Ukraine.

654
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:58,240
Even in Germany, whatever, even in Germany, it gained 15 percentage points of support.

655
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,080
And I am sure of one thing that in Germany, people have never heard of me.

656
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:07,200
And in Finland, people have never heard of me. And in Spain, people have never heard of me.

657
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,600
So I think we should put it the other way around. First, people realized. And then

658
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:24,240
well, the people that said, I can explain you why become popular.

659
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:31,760
So I have some closing questions that I ask all my guests. I have so much more I want to talk to

660
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:38,720
you about. But before I get to those questions, let me just ask you one one final content question.

661
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:46,080
What the hell are we going to do? What should we do facing this as nations?

662
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:49,280
You're on the spot, Jean-Marc. Go for it.

663
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:59,200
As nations, we will do what our populations ask for, as long as we are democracies.

664
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:05,200
Which is why at the SHIFT project, we never considered that we should address first and

665
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:12,000
foremost politicians. But we believe that we should address first and foremost the civil society.

666
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:19,200
So the people that we're interested to deal with are people who are deciding in the economic sector,

667
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:27,200
are deciding as civil servants, are deciding as academics. So people that frame our collective

668
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:35,280
knowledge and people that are deciding in the NGO sector. So this is our primary audience.

669
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:41,440
The people that we want to talk to is the civil society. And we believe that the day

670
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:47,920
we are able to convince a sufficient fraction of that civil society, that it goes up because

671
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:54,640
democracies are systems that go up. And the elected people have to take that into account

672
01:13:54,640 --> 01:14:01,440
in a way or another. And I never believe that we should talk to politicians first. And actually,

673
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,560
I'm not especially eager to talk to them. I mean, once in a while, I've got an invitation

674
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:13,360
from a minister or whatever, so I'm polite. I go to it. But I don't hope much for it. And what

675
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,520
my real, the audience that I'm really interested in is the civil society.

676
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:24,320
So we need to shift society before the politicians. Yeah.

677
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:33,920
Yes. Exactly. You have a president elected because you have people voting for him, basically.

678
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:47,280
And a significant fraction of the civil society in France still, I'm not knowing the word inappropriate,

679
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:54,240
but escapes our influence. All the people that vote for the populist parties.

680
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:02,320
Basically, we are not able to talk to them today, which is an issue, which is a big issue. I mean,

681
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:06,320
we have to talk to these people and I still haven't found a way to do so.

682
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,240
Because these people actually are the first losers of the energy contraction. They don't

683
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:21,840
realize it, but they are the first. So we have to talk to them and we have to embark them on the

684
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:32,400
on the plan that we believe is, I would say, response correctly to the situation.

685
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:41,280
And I don't see that at my age, there is much more that I can do than going on,

686
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:46,480
doing what I've already done, which is working with companies at carbon four,

687
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:51,760
working with the civil society and the ship project and writing books.

688
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:59,360
Which, and as you may know, the Le Monde Saint-FranÃ§ois is going to be released in the U.S.

689
01:16:00,080 --> 01:16:05,920
We are currently working right now with my co-author on the U.S. version, because we have to

690
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:12,720
move from meters to feet, square meters to square feet.

691
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:22,480
And we have to change all the examples that pertain to France into examples that pertain to the U.S.

692
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,800
And when will that be out?

693
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:32,480
It should be released at the end of the year, if we're lucky. So end of the year or beginning

694
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:37,520
of next year, if we take too long in finishing the adaptation.

695
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:46,240
So the ultimate plan, then, is to combine efficiency and sobriety at multiple scales

696
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:54,240
in society to avert collapse and avert just abject poverty, some combination at institutional

697
01:16:54,240 --> 01:17:00,400
government and individual levels. Yes? Yes. Basically, you've summarized it correctly.

698
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:07,600
Excellent. I'm looking forward to getting your book. Let me ask you a few closing

699
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:15,040
questions, Jean-Marc, that I ask all my guests. We've talked about nations, etc.

700
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:21,760
What personal advice do you have to people watching this video, listening to this show,

701
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,640
at this time of global metacrisis?

702
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:31,680
I would say I have two. The first one is devote time to understand what's going on,

703
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:40,000
because basically, the solid conclusions that you get to is always the conclusions that you

704
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:50,400
have come to by yourself. We are, I mean, human nature is such that we don't like that much

705
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:59,680
conclusions that we're afraid by others. We lack our own. So take time, dig into the issue, read,

706
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:05,520
listen to people, watch conferences, whatever, read scientific literature if you can do it.

707
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:12,320
Otherwise, watch videos of people that are good at verbalizing the issue.

708
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:22,880
The second thing is do not stay alone, because it's an issue which is easy to become anxious

709
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:32,560
when you realize the magnitude of the issue. One of the things that we don't like is to

710
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,320
pull ourselves out of a group, because we have understood something that the rest of the group

711
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:47,600
hasn't understood. We will never do that to take action. The only action that we're able to take,

712
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:52,320
at least in Europe, maybe in the US, it's a little bit different, is collective action,

713
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:59,840
which is why it's easier to do something in the frame of a job, in the professional world,

714
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:06,800
it's easier to do something, because it can be collective action. We need to still have

715
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:14,560
social relationships. We still need to have a couple friends, kids, relatives, whatever,

716
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:22,080
and so moving forward is something which is much easier to do when you belong to a group.

717
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:27,600
Is there a way that the 500,000 people that bought your book or the 100,000 people that

718
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:35,120
bought your transformation essay or that follow your LinkedIn can connect and actually meet and

719
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:43,600
talk to each other in France, like Discord? There is a sister association of the SHIFT project,

720
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:50,480
which is called the SHIFTERS, which is the association of all the people that want to

721
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:58,480
give a helping hand to the work of the SHIFT project. Actually, this association today has

722
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:07,760
around 20,000 members, a small number of them being in foreign countries,

723
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:15,840
of course, but by and large, the two first foreign countries are Belgium and Switzerland,

724
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:23,120
because it's French-speaking countries, but we have a group in the UK, and we probably have a

725
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:33,120
small group in the US. This association is very well structured. It's structured as a company,

726
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:41,520
because most people that belong to that association come from the professional world,

727
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:46,800
and so they have organized the association basically as a company. So it's very well

728
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:54,880
structured. Yes, we have that. How would you change your answer about those two bits of advice

729
01:20:54,880 --> 01:21:00,560
if you were talking to young humans in France or in the United States or anywhere in the world?

730
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:08,000
16, 18, 20 years old who are learning about climate change and that energy availability might be

731
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:14,720
in oil, half of what it is 30 years from now. What sort of recommendations would you give to

732
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:23,360
young people? Actually, the youngest people that I often talk to are students,

733
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:29,440
so I do not talk to people, I do not very often talk to people that are still in high school

734
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:43,520
or primary school, but I would say that probably my first advice is to be reasonably good

735
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:53,280
in science, which is the way to connect to the physical world and the way to understand

736
01:21:53,280 --> 01:22:04,000
how things work, how the world works, where to listen at weak signals, to look at weak

737
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:11,040
signals before they become of first magnitude. So probably that the best advice that I would give

738
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:28,000
to young people would be to try to be good in science at large, which is again connecting

739
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:35,600
with the physical world. If you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your

740
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:41,920
decision, what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures?

741
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:45,280
Surprise greed?

742
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,720
That would require a magic wand, I think.

743
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,920
Including for me, including for you, including for everyone, I mean it's one of the things that

744
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:05,520
gives us, is that desire to have always more?

745
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:18,080
Well, energy surplus has certainly turbocharged that in humans. I think without as much energy

746
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:26,240
surplus, there was no possibility of having more all the time, so that is one of the things that

747
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:32,160
scares me the most is the concept of loss aversion because we are the richest generation ever to

748
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:40,560
live of humans on this planet and we would be happy with half what we have, but getting from

749
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:47,840
here to there is going to be a doozy because of our psychological expectations are not that as a

750
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:56,640
culture. Yes, I agree with that. Yeah, so this has been a great first overview of your work. I

751
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:03,680
know you are a nuclear, a world expert on nuclear energy and we didn't really have time to dive into

752
01:24:03,680 --> 01:24:10,800
that. If you were to come back on the program six months from now, what is one particular issue

753
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:15,600
that you are passionate about that's relevant to our future that we could take a deep dive on?

754
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:23,440
Do you have any speculation? I don't think that all the technological debates,

755
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:32,320
be it on nuclear energy or wind energy or hydrogen or etc., is a fundamental debate.

756
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:39,200
Basically, the fundamental debate is on cultural issues, just the one that we stated.

757
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:50,240
We will succeed one day in putting ethics above our greed, for example, we will succeed.

758
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,200
It seems to me that this debate is much more fundamental even though I've been

759
01:24:57,200 --> 01:25:03,840
trained as an engineer and for a very, very long time I was convinced that the future was in technical

760
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:21,600
fixes. Well, now I believe that actually it's in the way we accept to change our cultural references,

761
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:29,600
which is much harder actually. It's much easier to build a nuclear reactor than changing our minds.

762
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:37,760
Yeah, the next tech is maybe inner tech, the tech in our minds on how we experience the world

763
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:44,480
and how we can get most of the things we really want without using a lot of energy and materials.

764
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:50,240
At least that's my hope. This has been great. It was so nice to meet you and like I said,

765
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:56,320
it feels like we're on parallel paths and different parts of the world and if I can help you in your

766
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:03,120
work, let me know and I will definitely get your book when it comes to the United States and we'll

767
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:09,760
put all the show notes on this episode of your references and such. Thank you very much.
