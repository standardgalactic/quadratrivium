00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Greetings. Welcome to episode 100. What? 100 episodes. This time flew by. This has been the most challenging and the most rewarding thing I have ever done hosting this podcast, challenging because we're covering a lot of issues, not just one. And invariably these issues infringe on people's understanding or belief or ideology.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And it's difficult to host a multi-topic podcast. Rewarding because I feel less alone, I feel motivated by the hundreds of thousands of humans around the world that are wanting to learn more about this story.

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And that ultimately is the work, is we're trying to help more people normalize conversations about how everything fits together in a system science sense. It is threatening, it is daunting, it is scary, some of the information that we're presenting.

4
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But I'm not selling fear. I'm trying to sell understanding. Actually, I'm not trying to sell anything at all. All of our content is free. We've turned all monetization off on social media.

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We, of course, would accept and do need donations, tax deductible to the Institute for the Study of Energy in our Future. But it is my belief that anyone in the world that has internet could access this for free.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:54,000
There's a lot planned going forward. I do want to have more podcasts dealing with responses as opposed to just the problems. As things get more threatening, I'm hoping that I don't fly too close to the sun and get burned.

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But I'm all in on passing the baton to more humans working on this. I have asked for Episode 100, a friend of mine who works in a related space, to interview me. Without further ado, here is Episode 100 of the Great Simplification.

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Today's guest is Nate Hagins.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Nate is the director of the Institute for the Study of Energy in our Future, an organization that works with many others to assemble roadmaps and off-ramps for how human societies can adapt to lower throughput lifestyles.

10
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Nate holds a master's degree in finance from the University of Chicago and a PhD in natural resources from the University of Vermont.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He also happens to be the host of this podcast, The Great Simplification, except not today, because we are turning the tables and I am interviewing him. So please welcome Nate Hagins.

12
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hi, Nate. Great to see you.

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hey, Kate. Thank you so much for being here.

14
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, it's a big pleasure and this is the 100th episode of the podcast and I'm very honored that you asked me to turn the tables and interview you.

15
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And I just want to say that I think you very generously create this space and interview many people and give them space to put out their view, their knowledge, their experience of the world. So it's my pleasure to do that in reverse for you.

16
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Yeah, it's not anything I really ever planned on doing and fortunately I have a lot of friends like you that have a lot of knowledge and wisdom to share. So here we are 100 episodes in and thank you for being the hostess.

17
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My pleasure. So how are we going to go? I'm going to kick off in a way that you often start.

18
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm going to ask you to give me lots of one minute messages, just like the top line of the way you think. And then we can dive in deep to things, okay? You ready?

19
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I want to share one thing.

20
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mm-hmm.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yesterday, my girlfriend's daughter brought me this little screaming goat.

22
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And I'm thinking if there's really difficult questions, because I'm kind of nervous right now on the tables being turned, I might just differ and do the screaming goat.

23
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Because, you know, when I prepare for these podcasts, I've gotten used to it where I do, Lizzie, my curator prepares me for the scientist or whoever it is and gives me an arc of a conversation and I kind of prepare and then I just sit back and I ask you questions, right?

24
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But now you're asking me questions, so I'm a little nervous.

25
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Well, thank you for saying that and thank you for putting yourself in this situation and experiencing from what it's like from the other side. And I think it's going to go well.

26
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So...

27
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's do it.

28
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's do it. So let's jump in. I'm going to ask you just some big concepts that you use regularly in your work. Just give us a one minute summary of that message, okay?

29
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Tell me about energy blindness.

30
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Energy blindness is the fact that our society misunderstands energy in its role in our current living and our expectations.

31
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There are four aspects. One is that energy underpins everything in nature and everything in human systems. We need energy for everything.

32
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Number two, that we don't realize the scale of how much energy we use effectively four to five hundred billion human workers equivalent of fossil energy.

33
00:05:47,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The third is that this stuff is depleting very rapidly and culturally we're treating it as if it were interest, but it's actually a principal, a bank account that is being drawn down millions of times faster

34
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:19,000
than it was built up. And the fourth aspect of energy blindness is that when we burn all this energy to give us the modern conveniences and transport and consumption, there is a pollution and a waste that comes with that.

35
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And I think our cultural stories don't include any of that. And yet so much of our future and our expectations and institutions and culture depend on energy. So we're energy blind.

36
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
And I've sometimes heard you say that energy is the currency of life, yes?

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, in nature, those organisms and ecosystems that have surplus energy have had advantages. So there's lots of things important in life, but if you don't have energy, you can't move or eat or do anything.

38
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So energy is the currency of life and it always will be.

39
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I fully agree on that. And so then if energy is the currency of life, tell us about the carbon pulse.

40
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, the carbon pulse is began when humans started to discover first coal, then oil, then natural gas and farm under the earth instead of on top of the earth.

41
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:45,000
And if you look at a 300,000 year aerial view of our species, this little sliver of time where we're drawing down this ancient carbon and propelling our civilization using it can look like a pulse, like an EKG pulse that starts from nothing,

42
00:07:45,000 --> 00:08:01,000
goes to a high amount and then goes back to nothing. And we're all living in the middle of that, probably near the peak of that. And that is another thing that's not included in our cultural conversations is, you know, on a 500 year time

43
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:21,000
scale, we're a couple hundred years into the carbon pulse and what will the downslope of the carbon pulse look like. So I think this is an ecological deep time framing of the human cultural situation that is so prevalent in our lives, but we

44
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
don't talk about it.

45
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Okay. And that's exactly what we're going to talk about today. So if we are somewhere near the peak of this carbon pulse, what's the story with the economic super organism? What is that?

46
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So there are super organisms in nature like termite mound or an ant colony where all of the individual organisms collaborate and towards a larger unspoken goal. So the human super organism is not an actual biological entity,

47
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:15,000
but what it ends up being de facto an economic super organism that humans in this culture self organize as families as small businesses as corporations all the way up to nation states and the whole world to maximize profits.

48
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That is our marching orders by our culture. And those profits are tethered to energy. There's a 99% correlation between GDP, our economic output and energy consumption and 100% correlation to material consumption.

49
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And that energy is over 80% still tethered to fossil carbon. So what we're doing is rushing forward trying to optimize profits and GDP. And we've built all of our institutions and expectations around that without any other plan.

50
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:16,000
And what's happened is the momentum of that system, the momentum of that way of doing things is stronger than the individual wisdom and restraint that people within it try to imbue on the organism itself.

51
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In other words, we're in a runaway train shoveling more fuel into it and there is no conductor. There's not a politician or a billionaire that can say, wait a minute, this is the wrong objective. We need to change it.

52
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So the super organism is this metabolic system that is out of control and all it wants is more the lowest cost energy and other material things to power growth.

53
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay, we're going to come back to this runaway train with no conductor later. What do you mean when you talk about the Mordor economy?

54
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You know, J.R. Tolkien was so prescient in so many things. There's so many one liners from the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit that are so apropos to our current civilization.

55
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So our economy is based on energy, materials and productivity from technology and a lot of our productivity has come from just adding more fossil energy every single year because it's so potent.

56
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So some of our productivity has come from just more energy. And so the Mordor economy is instead of tightening our belts, instead of having ecological civilization, the default is that we will continue to have rule changes

57
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,000
and go and borrow more money and invent technology that might give us some energy, but it takes a lot of energy and materials to create.

58
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:15,000
And so what will happen is we will grow our gross, our GDP, which is our gross energy, but the amount of energy and materials and environmental impact that that will have will take up an increasing amount of the whole.

59
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:36,000
So in 1999, we hit a seven century low of how much energy it took to generate GDP for the rest of society. It was around 5%. Now we're over 10%. We're using 10 or more percent of our energy just to get the energy and refine it and deliver it to the rest of society.

60
00:12:36,000 --> 00:13:05,000
As we go higher to 15% or 20%, we gradually become more and more of a mining economy, aka Mordor economy. And as you're well aware, the pollution impacts not only climate but biodiversity and sperm count drop and insect loss and deforestation and all of that will increasingly take a toll on the human system.

61
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:24,000
And we're going to have to use more energy and materials to remediate what's happening there. So in short, a Mordor economy is currently the default path. And depending on your boundary of analysis, many people could rightly argue the Mordor economy is already here.

62
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:38,000
But what it basically means is that we optimize growth over ecology and our entire system becomes one of mining and consumption.

63
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And just to go into the stats you just gave there. So you're saying some years ago it was at a low like in a positive way that we were using around 5% of the energy used was to get access to energy and now that's gone up to 10% and you spoke as if that's inevitably going to rise.

64
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm sure some people are thinking, but isn't that possible to bring it back down again with new technologies with nuclear fusion or other kinds of breakthroughs in energy technologies that this we could bring it back down there and even lower? What's your view on that?

65
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Yes, well that would be the argument that some are using on artificial intelligence that it will rapidly find new ways of using our resources more efficiently or develop new technologies like nuclear fusion.

66
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And if those are done cheap enough, then you're right, maybe we do go back to a period where 7% of our GDP is energy creation and delivery and refining.

67
00:14:45,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But first of all, that's on the come. That's not the direction we're heading. Second of all, if that were to happen, we would still probably have a growing economy and this gets into the issue of Jebens paradox.

68
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:29,000
As the economy is growing, more efficiency and better technology doesn't result in lower energy use. It results in higher energy use globally and so the ecology side of the Mordor economy equation would be even more dramatic if that were to happen.

69
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But yeah, there are a lot of things out there that are being developed, but it's the net energy of them that I worry about. And this is one of the, what I've referred to in the past is the tragedy of the energy investing commons is suddenly, especially with Ukraine and Russia and now war in the Middle East.

70
00:15:50,000 --> 00:16:19,000
People are recognizing, holy crap, energy is really important. Let's do this or that technology to get more energy. But the actual energy and materials spent to procure that energy for society ends up being a lot larger than what has been 50 years ago when this whole civilization was kind of built forward on really cheap oil, gas and coal.

71
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Okay. And since you just started mentioning some geopolitics in the world, can you just briefly explain what's meant when you and others in conversation on this podcast have talked about the metacrisis?

72
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm suppressing the impulse to ask you what you think.

73
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No, no, no, no, Nate, we've turned the table.

74
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
No, I know that. I'm just telling you, I'm suppressing the impulse.

75
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Great. Thank you.

76
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You keep going.

77
00:16:43,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah. Well, the metacrisis, I mean, there's a lot of terms out there, the polycrisis, the metacrisis, I used to say the human predicament. It's when all these things are intertwining and coalescing and in an interconnected way, creating a really large capital letter problem.

78
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:30,000
There's the environmental crisis, there's the poverty, inequality, global south issues, there's debt, there are biological existential risks from bio weapons and CRISPR and AI and things like that.

79
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Just the ecological planetary boundaries issues alone is a metacrisis unto itself.

80
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And I mean, I'm sure we may talk about this, but one of the things I've learned from doing this podcast is there's so many bright people working on a part of the metacrisis,

81
00:17:53,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but they don't see the other parts because it's too big and they're like experts on their parts.

82
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But any one of these seven crises is huge on its own.

83
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:16,000
And so that's kind of what I've tried to do is connect how they fit together, but it's a big challenge as you're well aware.

84
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay, so I've got two more of these concepts that you often use.

85
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, okay, we're still on the speed round, okay.

86
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Yeah, we're still on the speed round, mate.

87
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay, four horsemen, who are these horsemen?

88
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You sometimes talk about the four horsemen I think of the 2020s, so explain.

89
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, I'm increasingly talking about that because it feels incredibly relevant, more relevant than other topics.

90
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So the four horsemen are briefly financial overshoot, which is when we've had economic problems in the past.

91
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Instead of tightening our belt, we actually do the opposite and we widen the spigot of credit creation and central bank guarantees and stimulus checks.

92
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:16,000
And so the whole world is between 350 and 400% debt to GDP.

93
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
And all of these financial claims on reality will require energy and materials to be manifested.

94
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:37,000
So we keep creating more and more monetary what people think they own claims on a ecological and energetic reality that is going to shrink in the future.

95
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And so this disconnect I refer to as a bend or break moment is coming soon.

96
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So that's the first horseman is the financial recalibration.

97
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The second is the move from a unipolar, the United States effectively world to a multipolar world, China, Russia, Europe, the various BRICS plus nations.

98
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:19,000
How the resource pie, how the monetary representations of who has access to what and 13,000 plus nuclear warheads.

99
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:34,000
How we navigate that 21st century, early 21st century game of risk in a peaceful, cohesive, non disruptive way is one of the horsemen.

100
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:53,000
The third is the complexity of our six continent just in time supply chain of medical pharmaceutical inputs and spark plugs made in South Korea only that get delivered to the United States.

101
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Food is delivered 1500 miles to the average dinner plate in the United States.

102
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:18,000
We have an incredibly efficient but non resilient system for delivering basic goods and services to people around the world that is predicated on cheap oil, global peace and credit.

103
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And then the fourth is the fourth horseman is the social contract and the trust and collaboration and interaction with citizens where you live.

104
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:47,000
And I don't know enough about British politics, but in the United States next year we have an election and I think no matter who wins a third of the country is going to be ballistic and upset and distrusting.

105
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And with AI and polarization and just the general stress of society, how do we keep the social contracts?

106
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:09,000
So I personally think that any, and this is why I think this is important Cape, any social change towards the better in the long run.

107
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Like we need to put price on carbon because we're burning more than the biosphere can take and we're burning it millions of times faster than it was sequestered and we should save some for our grandchildren as one example.

108
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Any major wealth distribution, any social programs that make the future better off any issue that people are concerned with that radically changes our economic system will then first have to navigate these four horsemen.

109
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:53,000
And that is kind of the focus of my work is no matter where we're going we have to navigate these four horsemen first.

110
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:03,000
And so that ultimately my work surrounds how do we prepare and respond for those sorts of economic social speed bumps.

111
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Got it.

112
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Right.

113
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
So we're going to come back to them.

114
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I have one more thing for you on this speed round.

115
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Okay.

116
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,000
And it is, of course, the mothership concept, the great simplification.

117
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What is it, Nate?

118
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You know, I struggled with thinking about the name of this podcast.

119
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That one had a triple entendre.

120
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:35,000
One was that for many people listening to this show in the global north, a simplification of their lives could actually be great.

121
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We don't need all this energy and pecuniary trappings to live a good meaningful life.

122
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So simplifying is a good thing.

123
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Another is I have so many complex topics in the news and I try to simplify them in a way that people can understand.

124
00:23:53,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But the main choice of word is an academic interpolation of Joseph Tater's work that he wrote a book called The Collapse of Complex Civilization.

125
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
And what humans do is we solve problems.

126
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
And as the system gets bigger, we solve more problems.

127
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:29,000
When we solve problems, we need more energy to throw at the technology or the supply chains or whatever it is we're solving.

128
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And so what we've done on the upslope is we have incredibly complexified our lives.

129
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And all this has happened every single year other than 2020, 2009 financial crisis, a few years in the 1970s energy crisis, World War and a Great Depression.

130
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Any of those, all the last 150 years we've had more energy added to the human system than the year before.

131
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And we just naturally assume that this will continue.

132
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:13,000
So the great simplification is when we are unable to continue to add energy to solve our problems, the inverse will happen.

133
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:28,000
A simplification where we have to do more with less technology becomes really important, efficiency becomes important, and we're going to have to live more locally.

134
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And the word great is because I think it will be one of the greatest events ever faced in modern history, this simplification.

135
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
What does it mean in the vernacular?

136
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I think one of the next three recessions will be a depression economically.

137
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And the reason for that is had we simplified 50 years ago, then it wouldn't have been so bad.

138
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
But now we've got all these financial claims that we've created.

139
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
So the first step off will be a doozy.

140
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
A what?

141
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
A doozy.

142
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I don't know if that's a British term.

143
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Really?

144
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
You don't know what that means?

145
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Doozy.

146
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
D-O-O-Z-Y means a big one.

147
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
A big one.

148
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
A big one.

149
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Okay, it'll be a big one.

150
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay.

151
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Okay.

152
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Great.

153
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Okay.

154
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Well, that is a big one.

155
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I mean, these concepts you...

156
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We're probably going to have to edit that out.

157
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
These concepts are big.

158
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
So we're just going to take a break and I just want you to appreciate my studio here.

159
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Have you seen what I've done here?

160
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Yeah.

161
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
That is...

162
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Do you like that?

163
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I only see you usually from the narrow window.

164
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And now I see that you've got a great simplification podcast studio, London Style.

165
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Thank you so much.

166
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I've always been impressed by your creation of visual aids.

167
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Did you do that just for this show?

168
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Of course I did that just for this show.

169
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Oh, my gosh.

170
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I borrowed it from my neighbors and some little paper lanterns from somebody else.

171
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
And yeah, just, you know, had to inhabit the studio.

172
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
So it's great.

173
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I like it.

174
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Well, for the record, you so could do this.

175
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I know you're very, very busy with Donut and Deal and everything, but you would be excellent at this.

176
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Well, you're very kind.

177
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Actually, a podcast is high in my sights.

178
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I really think this method of exploration of ideas, of conversation is where so many people learn

179
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and have time, whether you're doing the washing up or the ironing or taking kids to school

180
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
or, right, certainly for many adults, I know this is the only place I get to listen

181
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
and get ideas rather than reading.

182
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:02,000
But I think conversation between people is a fantastic way of all of us opening our minds,

183
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
which is, I think, why this podcast has become so popular and the way you host it.

184
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
So, so you've given us the big concepts, right, of a great simplification.

185
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Now, let's just step back.

186
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
How did you get into all this then?

187
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
You didn't start out doing this work.

188
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Take us back to what you were doing before you were doing this.

189
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I want to hear the start of that journey and what triggering events have led you to be sitting here.

190
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
How far back?

191
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
You're going to have to choose that.

192
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Take us to the place where we'll be like, you were doing what?

193
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
When I was three years old, I was sitting on my mom's lap in the front seat of the car

194
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
scanning the horizon for animals, and I would always want to go for a ride in the car

195
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,000
because I wanted to see what animals we could see either on the road or on the horizon.

196
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And my mom said that by the time I was six, she had taken me to more zoos

197
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
than probably any other six-year-old in the United States.

198
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:09,000
So that's the foundation of it, is I had a deep love for animals in the natural world when I was a child.

199
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
And can I just jump in and say that's just a beautiful connection between deep love for nature, dependence on energy, right?

200
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Fossil energy to connect with zoos.

201
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
It's this wonderful, complex story that you've inhabited right from the beginning.

202
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Yeah, I didn't think about the energy part.

203
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You're absolutely right.

204
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I lived in Southern Oregon when I was in grade school,

205
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
and every day after school, I would rush home and get my dog,

206
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,000
and we would just go for hours in the foothills and look for salamanders and climb trees.

207
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Well, he wouldn't, but that was my formative thinking where you let your mind wander

208
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
and you're just in nature.

209
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I mean, to have a childhood like that and the formative impression that that has on your mind and your soul

210
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,000
is really a privilege because I don't think that many people have that freedom and access today.

211
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
But I think that was my rosebud to use a citizen cane term,

212
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:26,000
which is those free hours every day in the foothills of the Siski Mountains in Southern Oregon.

213
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Then I got hijacked by status-seeking and trying to make more money to get a better car

214
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,000
and a better apartment and the American cultural dream in the 80s.

215
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
I went and got my masters at the University of Chicago, and I went to work on Wall Street

216
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and I managed money for billionaires effectively.

217
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I had to cold call people, but I wasn't allowed to call anyone if they were worth less than $100 million.

218
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I'm serious. This was 1993.

219
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Those were my clients, and over time, I realized that these people were no happier

220
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,000
than the clerks processing their trades, making $25,000 a year.

221
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
One of them started to trade, invest, speculate in oil.

222
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I started to learn a lot about oil, and I realized, oh my God, it's going to peak and decline in my lifetime.

223
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh my God, it's incredibly powerful.

224
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I never heard the word energy mention my entire master's program in finance.

225
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
What? We don't pay for any of the pollution and the externalities.

226
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Those aren't included in the prices.

227
00:31:50,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I became so obsessed with learning about ecology and energy that eventually I wasn't doing my job real well

228
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
because I was obsessed on learning all this other stuff that I quit.

229
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
I gave my clients their money back.

230
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I had a backpack full of books and a golden retriever, and I went to British Columbia in Alaska

231
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
and hiked and thought and read for six months.

232
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Then I came back and Herman Daly introduced me to Josh Farley, who you know.

233
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Josh and John Erickson were my PhD advisors along with Robert Costanza at University of Vermont.

234
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
That broadened out my awareness.

235
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
It's not just energy. It's not just oil.

236
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
It's human behavior.

237
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:45,000
It's aggregate anthropological momentum of the human superorganism.

238
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I became really intellectually curious about how all this stuff fit together.

239
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I became a contributor on the oil drum and eventually co-ran the oil drum,

240
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
which was an interesting model because we had over 30 PhDs

241
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,000
that were volunteering their time for the greater social good to share information.

242
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:13,000
It was a neat little cafe sandbox of intellectual collaboration for a while.

243
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Then I got really freaked out about the debt versus energy thing in like 10 years ago.

244
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I approached Homeland Security looking at how we would buttress our supply chains

245
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
if there was a Minsky moment where we realized we weren't able to service our debt.

246
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
So more Minsky than the housing market?

247
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Yeah. Minsky with a capital M.

248
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Do you want to just explain because some people might not know what Minsky moment means?

249
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:56,000
A Minsky moment is where you can no longer solve a credit crisis by adding more credit.

250
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's the moment where everyone recognizes what's happening and there's an exodus

251
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
and you can't solve the thing by adding more credit because there's no trust there.

252
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Right now, the markets are approaching new highs and people are still dancing

253
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,000
because the credit spigot is still on, but they're dancing closer to the doors in talking with them.

254
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,000
But anyways, getting back to your question, which I'm giving way too long winded of an answer,

255
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I then started realizing that the people in middle age between 25 and 60 have no bandwidth

256
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
because their status and identity were attached to the jobs and the positions they were in.

257
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,000
In this story, the great simplification, which wasn't fully formed back then,

258
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,000
was too abstract and threatening to their current work.

259
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:07,000
And so I did a barbell approach where I started to teach reality 101 to young people

260
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
and I talked to retired politicians above 70 years old who had time to learn about these things.

261
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:24,000
And then two years ago, just about now, I started this podcast and I've learned a ton

262
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
and I'll echo what you just said a few minutes ago that I have a pretty strong opinion

263
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:41,000
about how the world works and where we're headed, but I also know that no one can know everything

264
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
and there's so many things that I learned from all of my conversations.

265
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And so I'm just trying to connect this tapestry of how things fit together,

266
00:35:52,000 --> 00:36:02,000
but not only facts, also the humanity of people and how everyone on this program that I've hosted

267
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
really cares about the future and not a lot of us have answers on what to do,

268
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,000
but I think there's this emergence of this intellectual, heart-led understanding

269
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,000
and hope for a better future that there's something building there that I think is potentially important.

270
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Right. And then on that journey from, say, working with those multi-millionaires to now,

271
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
just to keep you could name one big cognitive shift that you've made,

272
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:43,000
one big emotional change that you've made in your life and practical changes about where and how you live.

273
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,000
A big cognitive change. The cognitive change is the superorganism is incredibly powerful

274
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and 15 years ago, I wouldn't have imagined that on the dawn of 2024,

275
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,000
we would still have this amount of debt and this amount of energy.

276
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The cognitive change is that this superorganism has got gold-plated scales and is very difficult to stop.

277
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
So I've cognitively come to respect that, though at the same time, the more it grows and expands,

278
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:30,000
the worse the biosphere and other species are generally.

279
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:44,000
Emotionally, well, I've grieved for the future that our society tells us is coming long ago.

280
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,000
So my expectations are lower than the average person.

281
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
So emotionally, I've come to terms with that.

282
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
But emotionally, there's a bifurcation, Kate.

283
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,000
On the one hand, the stuff that I carry is increasingly feels like a lodestone

284
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:18,000
because I'm trying to stay on top of neuroscience and oil depletion and debt and biodiversity loss

285
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
and endocrine disruptors and each one of those categories is kind of fricking depressing.

286
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And when you aggregate them all, humans didn't evolve to carry that amount of stress about the future

287
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
with them every day.

288
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
And the antidote to that, as you might know, because we were just together last month, two months ago,

289
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,000
is being with people like you and other colleagues that are working on this is like a balm

290
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
because I don't feel so alone and I don't feel the burden as much

291
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
because other people are living through thinking the same things.

292
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So emotionally, that's kind of the battle.

293
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,000
And before you go on for one, actually, I just want to jump in there and say I recognize that as well,

294
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,000
the value of connecting with others and just to recognize that through the work I do with Donut Economics Action Lab,

295
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
what I've discovered is there are just so many people who share this but will never be on a podcast

296
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,000
or their name will never be known or will never get publicly recognized,

297
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:32,000
but in their communities, in their classrooms, in their town halls, they are leading and doing this and holding this as well.

298
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And I get huge energy and solidarity from that as well,

299
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:47,000
that there's so many people who actually in their own way are holding the recognition that the complexity

300
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
and what has to change in starting to try and make it happen.

301
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The third one was how have you changed where you live and how you live?

302
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I live on the border of Minnesota and Wisconsin.

303
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I think it's a reasonably good place for the future, low population density.

304
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
People are kind of generally Scandinavian socialists here.

305
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
They help their neighbors.

306
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,000
It's close to the Mississippi River.

307
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,000
All the people I know and love are in the United States.

308
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I mean, my family are in the United States.

309
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
For the longest time, my girlfriend and I grew maybe 30 or 40% of our own food

310
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:39,000
and we have horses and hazelnuts and apple trees and we were selling garlic to the local farmers market

311
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
because we grew thousands of bulbs.

312
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
But when I started this work, like in earnest a couple years ago, all that kind of changed

313
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
because I was very fricking busy.

314
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:59,000
So I'm trying to advocate that people simplify and my own life is suddenly complexified

315
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:07,000
and I struggle with that because I don't have time to do the weeding and the wood chopping

316
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and the planting and the things that I was doing myself four years ago.

317
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The other thing is one of the things I really recognize as a roadblock to sustainability

318
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:31,000
and living differently is our connection to social media and computers and instant stimulation technology

319
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
and I rail against that, especially with my 19-year-old students.

320
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And yet I'm being pulled right back into it myself kind of unavoidably as an externality of this work

321
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
and I joke that I'm using the devil's tools to do Gaia's work

322
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
and there has to be kind of a middle of the fairway response there

323
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,000
but that's something that I'm struggling with in what I'm doing.

324
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I could live in a 10 by 10 shack on the property here and use very little resources and live on the land

325
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,000
but then I wouldn't be hosting a podcast and passing the baton to other humans

326
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,000
who are trying to make a difference on our collective issues.

327
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
So it will probably perpetually be a challenge that I'm sure you also deal with.

328
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Yeah, so a couple of things.

329
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,000
So when you say I don't have the time and I always think time is the ultimate constraint of our energy budget

330
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,000
because in a way what you're saying is I don't have the time to use my own energy, my own bodily energy

331
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,000
to chop wood and to plant food and to do all the other things as well

332
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,000
because using my own energy, doing a great simplification requires more of my time budget.

333
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,000
So of course we're always talking about energy.

334
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Everything is always about energy because it's the currency behind everything else we're doing

335
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,000
but I'm really struck with the way energy keeps coming up, of course, in the story that you're telling.

336
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I want to ask you one thing that I find challenging.

337
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
You're one of many people I know in the UK as well.

338
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,000
I know quite a few people working in the climate movement or environmental movement

339
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
and I live in the city of Oxford or they might live in London

340
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,000
and then there comes a moment when they lead the city and they go rural and they buy land

341
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
and they buy high land and they start growing food

342
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,000
and as a city dweller I think like is this prepping

343
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,000
and what challenges me is that we can't all buy that land

344
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
and there's not right Mark Twain buy land, they don't make it any more well.

345
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
There isn't enough for everyone to take that route so I kind of stand firmly in the city

346
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
and think well we have to make it work here too because most of us are here

347
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
so I'd just love to hear your little bit of a challenge there

348
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
and we just want to hear your response to that.

349
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,000
We can't all go rural and buy land and grow our own food.

350
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I don't own the land I'm on and I totally agree with you

351
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
and this gets to a larger issue of the messaging

352
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,000
and the help of this podcast to various people around the world.

353
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Everyone is in a different situation, there's not one size fits all

354
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
and that is something I struggle with.

355
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,000
As far as land, I just love living really and I always have.

356
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I just hated New York City, I had to get out of there, it was sucking my soul.

357
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
As far as prepping, this gets back to the economic concept of comparative advantage.

358
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I've learned that like one unit, one family, they can't do everything

359
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:03,000
and so I like to think of pro-social prepping that the first and most important thing there isn't land,

360
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,000
it's community and getting to know others and sharing responsibility

361
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,000
and you grow this and I'll process this or whatever

362
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
because there isn't enough time for every family to do all the things.

363
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But yeah, the rural versus urban, I don't know the answer to that.

364
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I think cities have ecological footprints, orders of magnitude larger than their physical proximity

365
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:42,000
and I don't know how that's all going to work out but I hear your challenge there

366
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:53,000
and I feel so privileged and lucky to live on the land and have animals, horses, chickens, geese, no geese, ducks,

367
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
guinea fowl and dogs and cats.

368
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I don't have children but I do have animals.

369
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I like the concept of pro-social prepping because that's something we can all do everywhere

370
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
and David Sloan Wilson will be the first to say we should all be doing pro-social prepping all the time

371
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
because we're going to need it.

372
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,000
That is one technology, one connection that we are all going to need whatever.

373
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Totally agree.

374
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Yeah, so you've told us the story of how you got your journey to here.

375
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:31,000
So let's hear your view on humanity's journey from here.

376
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Okay, so I want to come back to the super organism concept and I've heard you in some of your franklies

377
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
or in some conversations with people.

378
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:46,000
It sounds like the super organism and by the way, as you know, I asked on Twitter,

379
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
hey, I'm turning the table and it's anybody and I got Godney questions

380
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
and people brought so many questions and thank you to everybody who brought in questions.

381
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I'm not going to bring in as many of them as I can, but quite a few questions were around this.

382
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:05,000
So do you think that the super organism is beyond control?

383
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
It's just going to roll.

384
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:16,000
You recently interviewed Robert Sapolsky who said, you know, we are hardwired to get it wrong.

385
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Well, are we hardwired to get it wrong?

386
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,000
So are we hardwired to get it wrong?

387
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,000
So the super organism is a source of finance and the structures and the supply chains

388
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,000
that all that contribute to this super organism.

389
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Do you believe it's just locked in, inevitable that this is beyond our control?

390
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Because that's a pretty strong conclusion to come to.

391
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Wiring from our successful ancestors.

392
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:57,000
That can be soft or hard, depending on culture and the circumstances.

393
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
I love my conversation with Robert until the free will part.

394
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And granted, I'm not an expert on that.

395
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:15,000
But the way that I see it is there are ecological and biological laws that are unfolding.

396
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:22,000
One is the maximum power principle, which is organisms and ecosystems in nature self-organized

397
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
so as to degrade basically an energy gradient or an amount of energy surplus.

398
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
And we as a civilization have been doing that.

399
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And sometimes I think that we had to come to this point of finding fossil carbon

400
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:50,000
and building this monstrosity of a Rube Goldberg machine nature-eating mousetrap

401
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
in order to really have this gut check as a culture, as a species,

402
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
on a deep time perspective of where we are, where we're headed,

403
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:07,000
what we know, how we can do it to actually change the default path that we've created.

404
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:15,000
And I'm uncertain about what's going to happen,

405
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,000
but there are certain things I'm quite confident in.

406
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Growth will end.

407
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000
That is a certainty.

408
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
What's uncertain is how long in the future that will be

409
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:32,000
and what sort of a drop that will be and what happens afterward.

410
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,000
So the super organism is in control.

411
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Just look at the prime minister in your country.

412
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
And the president of my country are both ostensibly climate aware,

413
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:53,000
yet they're approving new leases in Alaska and in the North Sea

414
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:58,000
because of the momentum of the system demands that we have that energy.

415
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,000
So I just don't know that any group of humans, as powerful even as they might be,

416
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
could stop this system until it stops of its own momentum,

417
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:19,000
which is that debt gets too big or there's a war that cascades everything down

418
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
or any number of things that would actually stop it of its own accord.

419
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Other than that, I think we will...

420
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,000
Well, since 2015, the Paris Accord,

421
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
all the industrialized nations, perhaps with the exception of the US,

422
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
accept that climate is happening and it's because of emissions.

423
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Yet since that time, we've grown our coal capacity by over 200 gigawatts globally.

424
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:54,000
So all the scaling of renewable energy and everything that's happening

425
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,000
that is ostensibly good for climate in the local region where it is,

426
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:04,000
hasn't done a thing to slow emissions globally.

427
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:12,000
So from an ecological climate CO2 biosphere perspective,

428
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,000
the superorganism is still completely in control.

429
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:22,000
And so what I'm trying to think about is what are the things we can do now

430
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,000
to anticipate and change the initial conditions of the moment

431
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:36,000
when the superorganism of its own weight and momentum and metabolism starts to splinter.

432
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And I think that's coming in the not too distant future.

433
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I don't know that I answered your question.

434
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
This is... I mean, I do interviews all the time, like I'm on someone else's podcast,

435
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:53,000
but to have you interview me on my podcast, it's a little strange, but...

436
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Did that make sense to you, Kate?

437
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Yeah, it did. And so I want to ask...

438
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
I mean, there's so many things coming up for me.

439
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
So you said, you know, we've done nothing at all to slow the growth of global emissions.

440
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,000
And I want to say, wait, well, we don't know the counterfactual.

441
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,000
What we know, we haven't stopped them from growing.

442
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
But perhaps, I mean, for all the civic...

443
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,000
If we hadn't done these things, then emissions would have been 10% higher than they are now.

444
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,000
OK, right.

445
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:21,000
So that means that there is resistance, there is intention to transform,

446
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:27,000
and it's having some impact, which, of course, for people who are dedicating their lives

447
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,000
or their weekends to resistance to transformation,

448
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
that's really important to know that we can actually make a dent on this thing.

449
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,000
We can start to shift it and we can believe that we can...

450
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
If we mobilize the right way and a lot of things come into line, we can move this.

451
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I mean, I just want to offer some counters.

452
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Yes, OK, the US and the UK still opening up licenses for new oil.

453
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And yet other countries, Colombia, signing up to the fossil fuel nonproliferation treaty.

454
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Other countries committing to move away from it massively investing in renewables.

455
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So there are other countries that are doing differently.

456
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
So there's evidence that is not every political leader is locked into only going this direction.

457
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And of course, we need that evidence and the hope of possibility that change can be made.

458
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Boy, so lots of things to say here.

459
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,000
First of all, our entire civilization is based on carbon.

460
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
And so if we stop burning coal and natural gas and oil,

461
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:40,000
indirectly all the things in Walmart and Home Depot and whatever the shops are in London,

462
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
all of those have indirect carbon in there.

463
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
And I am a proponent that...

464
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm not a degrowth proponent.

465
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I think degrowth is what we should do,

466
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
but it's not going to happen because of the super organism dynamic.

467
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Post growth is what we're going to have to prepare for.

468
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:12,000
And so I just think that every scrap of cheap fossil energy

469
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
when economic times get tough will probably be sought after.

470
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I mean, India right now is...

471
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And China, China has the most renewable energy,

472
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,000
but they also have the most coal and they're scaling coal dramatically.

473
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:34,000
But my larger point is this and something I really struggle with, Kate,

474
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,000
is I'm trying to act as a witness and a translator of what's going on,

475
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
both in my own analysis and in the people that I interview.

476
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:54,000
That is different than being a cheerleader and a spokesperson and an activist.

477
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:04,000
So I really struggle with this podcast at times on being accurate or being helpful.

478
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And I really do think that a lot of the discussions in the climate and degrowth space

479
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
are energy blind and they don't realize the critical importance

480
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:22,000
that oil and other energy has to every aspect of our society

481
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
and that if we were to do the right thing ecologically

482
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,000
and really crimp our use of hydrocarbons,

483
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:37,000
that would entail a massive collapse in the state of our world

484
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:42,000
unless it happened gradually and it was planned for.

485
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:48,000
And I'm trying to tell the truth but also be inspiring and helpful to people

486
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
and sometimes that's hard.

487
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
So much to say in response.

488
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:58,000
I recognize that you may struggle with am I being a witness

489
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and am I being helpful because of course I'm sure you're very aware

490
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
that your voice and your opinion also has influence.

491
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
It's not just from the outside.

492
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So you might say I'm not an activist but the position you hold

493
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:20,000
and the forecast that you see has influence upon the world

494
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
and so in a way it's an action, it's playing into it.

495
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
But I want to pick up on...

496
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I mean you're the person from whom I know the phrase

497
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
will we bend or break?

498
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
Now that tells me that there's an option there

499
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:39,000
that this isn't just we're going to roll it out, we're just going to use it all.

500
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:46,000
There is a choice and there's a possibility that we could bend

501
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,000
and we have left it late as you've said but that we can bend

502
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,000
and I see your podcast as informing us so that we can be as informed as we can.

503
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,000
How do we now bend rather than we're just watching this thing slide towards break?

504
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Yeah, so the bend versus break initiated with my work with Homeland Security

505
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
on the financial recalibration because when that happens

506
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,000
and things cascade, it could be really bad

507
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:26,000
and of course nuclear war or all kinds of other things could precipitate that.

508
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I actually am hopeful that humans will navigate what's coming

509
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:34,000
and that we will bend as opposed to break

510
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,000
but bending isn't just turning off coal and natural gas and installing solar panels

511
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
the ask is much, much deeper than that.

512
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm agnostic on whether renewables globally

513
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
and as you know you've watched my stuff.

514
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
There's no such thing as renewable energy.

515
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The ball of gas in the sky is renewable and the wind is renewable

516
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
but these components that we build to harvest the sun and the wind

517
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,000
will have to be rebuilt every 20 or 30 years.

518
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Very little of the components that go into them are being recycled

519
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
so without this giant amount of energy surplus that we take for granted

520
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,000
how will we build those things 20 years from now, 40 years from now, 60 years from now?

521
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,000
So the answers are we're going to have to use less

522
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,000
but we're not going to choose to use less as a society.

523
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:34,000
As individuals and communities maybe we can choose to use less ahead of time

524
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,000
psychologically becoming more resilient by consuming less

525
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,000
prepares an individual for a simplified future.

526
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
And then I think the social capital of having conversations about this

527
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:54,000
in communities wherever you live in the world

528
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:59,000
looking two or three steps ahead and trying to ignore the siren song of

529
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,000
AI and cooler gadgets and markets are near all-time highs

530
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,000
and we've always had problems before and technology solved it

531
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
and look at what's really happening at the ground level.

532
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I do think humans will have some emergent practices

533
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,000
and new things that I can't even offer to you right now.

534
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I just see it in a lot of places that these conversations are happening.

535
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I lost the core of your question there.

536
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
So we're on bend or break I was really struck and I was glad to hear you say

537
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm hopeful that we can bend and it's going to take a lot more.

538
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Let me make a clarification on something earlier.

539
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I chose the word simplification because I think we're headed for a smaller

540
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
less global less material society.

541
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
I did not use the word collapse.

542
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
First of all collapse is binary.

543
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's yes collapse or no collapse.

544
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Simplification is more of a spectrum.

545
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Second of all the great simplification is already here.

546
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's just not evenly distributed.

547
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I mean there are many places in the world that are already suffering

548
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,000
a post-economic peak.

549
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:29,000
For instance I had a young woman from Lebanon on the podcast.

550
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Lebanon's economy is down 50% from three years ago.

551
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
That is a simplification and I'm sure people following the news

552
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
all different places in the world are experiencing natural resource problems

553
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
and economic problems and currency problems.

554
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,000
So I don't think collapse is inevitable.

555
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I think a simplification is inevitable.

556
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
But I guess it depends on how you define the terms.

557
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Right and just to come back I heard you say several times over many episodes

558
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,000
degrowth is what we should do.

559
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Post-growth is what we probably will do.

560
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Can I just clarify because people mean very different things when they use this language.

561
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Do you mean by degrowth do you mean a planned...

562
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
I mean this is what when I listen to leading thinkers in the degrowth movement

563
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:18,000
like Jason Hickel and Yorgos Callis they would say

564
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:23,000
degrowth means a planned reduction in material and energy use

565
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
of the less necessary consumption and production.

566
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So do you mean we should plan to reduce

567
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,000
but you don't think that we will do it

568
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
and therefore we'll get post-growth which would be a forced reduction.

569
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Would that be a way of putting it?

570
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Yes.

571
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
A little more I'll add to that.

572
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
From an ecological deep time ethical perspective

573
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
degrowth is what we should do.

574
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,000
If you had a benevolent pro-social alien philosopher looking at Earth

575
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:04,000
our consumption is massively unsustainable

576
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
so to protect the biosphere for future generations of ours and other species

577
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
we should use a lot less

578
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
and we should be living within our means.

579
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I don't think that will happen.

580
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Can I just interrupt you that moment and say like

581
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
here's a doughnut they made earlier it's the same thing right?

582
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
An alien looking at this would say

583
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
humans sort yourselves out

584
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
come back within planetary boundaries

585
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
by reducing your energy and material through flow

586
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,000
meet the needs of the poorest people in the world

587
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:37,000
and to me this is a visual of very similar to that same message

588
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
of planned reduction that meets the needs of all.

589
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So we're agreeing so degrowth and doughnut

590
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
and yourself on that would say yes this is what we should do.

591
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
That's the should.

592
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,000
Okay, continue.

593
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Well on the doughnut

594
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,000
what I would say is that

595
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,000
human behavior, individual and aggregate

596
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,000
that the inner part of the doughnut

597
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
will not want to stay within boundaries

598
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
it will want to expand

599
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,000
and so the inner part of the doughnut

600
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
will want to be greater than its planetary boundaries

601
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,000
and that's what we face of sorts.

602
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,000
So I think the doughnut to use your work and your example

603
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,000
is a great carrot for an Overton window

604
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
of where we need to go

605
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
but what I mean about degrowth not happening

606
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,000
is I don't think there is a way politically

607
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
for a country or a world

608
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
to consciously with a plan degrow

609
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
because there would be riots

610
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
and craziness and financial market collapses

611
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
and nuclear war and actually if it were

612
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,000
if we did have the authoritarian means

613
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
to degrow voluntarily

614
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I think it would trigger the four horsemen

615
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
in quite bad ways.

616
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
What we can do.

617
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Wouldn't the continued pursuit of growth

618
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I've also heard you say like the continued pursuit of growth

619
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,000
is likely to trigger those very same things.

620
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Yes and here we are Kate, that's correct

621
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
but that's not immediate

622
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:22,000
and there are chances that we might design some new technology

623
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,000
if AI were suddenly to imbue wisdom

624
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
into its algorithms as well as intelligence

625
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I'm not holding my breath

626
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
but there are possible ways that we could

627
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
invent mushrooms that sequester carbon

628
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:43,000
and that we change our GDP

629
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,000
to include things that are of ecosystem service benefits

630
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
or things that I can't imagine

631
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,000
but my larger point is that degrowth

632
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
we can change the initial conditions

633
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
which is why a lot of my friends are in the degrowth movement

634
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:04,000
because we ultimately have to start thinking about

635
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,000
how to organize our own lives and that's of society

636
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
by using less material and resources.

637
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I just think it not only won't happen voluntarily

638
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
but it is incredibly dangerous where it to happen

639
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
suddenly and voluntarily.

640
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
But to me this is the home turf towards bend

641
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:28,000
like if we're going to bend, not break

642
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
we have to, whether it's in the name of degrowth

643
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:36,000
or other movements that we need to move in this direction

644
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,000
you said you're hopeful that we can bend

645
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,000
so I want to take our conversation in that direction

646
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
can we go there?

647
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,000
What would it take in different areas

648
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
if I can bring some different areas

649
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
so first of all I want to ask you

650
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
do you think that civil disobedience

651
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:56,000
and nonviolent direct action that we've seen

652
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
rising up around the world in different movements

653
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
do you think that is a way that people can play a role

654
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
in helping to make something happen

655
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
that the system will start to bend?

656
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
So let me clarify something

657
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
bend versus break could be society as a whole

658
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
in the past I've largely used it

659
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
to refer to the financial overshoot that we have

660
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
that when we issue new money

661
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,000
that money is just digital or electronic

662
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
or paper claims on a physical reality

663
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:34,000
we spend it on building out our physical reality

664
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
at the same time there's a liability

665
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
if we owe this money in the future

666
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
so we're building our physical structure higher

667
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
and eventually there's going to be this

668
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,000
wily coyote moment where those claims

669
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
can't be fulfilled by our underlying reality

670
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
and so when I refer to bend versus break

671
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
it's that moment

672
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
but you also could say we're at a social contract

673
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
bend or break moment

674
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,000
and you also very correctly could say

675
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
we're at a planetary boundaries bend or break moment

676
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
so there's lots of different bend versus breaks

677
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:16,000
so as far as civil disobedience

678
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,000
I'm of two minds with that

679
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
a lot of the people that are out there

680
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
with just stop oil and other civil disobedience

681
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,000
have the same value systems that I do

682
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
so in that sense I fully support

683
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,000
what they're doing and their intent

684
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
but from the perspective of the four horsemen

685
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
which is my systems ecology vantage point

686
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I have two problems with that

687
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
one is there could be a triggering of

688
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
a disruption that could be the cure is worse than the disease

689
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
and the second is that for all of these things

690
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
that we care about

691
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,000
we're looking at a non-systemic solution

692
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:08,000
like let's make natural gas and propane stoves

693
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
in the northeast make those illegal

694
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,000
or let's shut down all the coal plants

695
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
so those two things would be good for climate change

696
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
for the people that care about climate change

697
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
but everyone else is looking at that

698
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
and saying why are we doing that

699
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
that doesn't make sense from our economic

700
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,000
our current cultural values standpoint

701
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:36,000
so we're solving things by using our lens

702
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,000
of the problem without looking at the whole system

703
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
and so I think we need to have an extension

704
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
of the degrowth conversation is

705
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:54,000
how do we live and plan for a less connected

706
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,000
global society where our aspirations

707
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
are something more than consumption

708
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
and dopamine etc

709
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
and I know that's embedded in the degrowth

710
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
of scholarship in places

711
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
and it's embedded in your work on the donut

712
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,000
so I'm I just I guess I'm too focused on

713
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
the systemic risk aspect to be a big fan

714
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
of civil disobedience

715
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
but we can't go on a march saying

716
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:31,000
make everything right again

717
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:35,000
right and that's why I'm at a crossroads

718
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:39,000
in this work Kate because other than

719
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
individual preparation and designing

720
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:47,000
ben not break policies for governments

721
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I don't know what the the movement is

722
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
that would be popular and this is a big

723
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,000
challenge with this podcast is there are

724
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
so many different demographics that follow

725
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,000
this show there are energy experts and

726
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
there are psychologists and there's

727
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
degrowthers and there's a lot of climate

728
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
people that follow this and it's hard to

729
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
look at everything beyond the one thing

730
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
that you care about and so what ends up

731
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
happening is events in the world are

732
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
getting dicier and worse and so I'm

733
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
expanding this conversation but it ends

734
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:34,000
up offending people that are in one area

735
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,000
of their focus and it's really hard

736
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
this could be a much more popular and

737
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
maybe helpful podcast if I just focused

738
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
on one thing and you know bellowed my

739
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,000
heart and soul out on that one thing

740
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,000
and attracted those viewers in the world

741
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
that were knowledgeable and cared about

742
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:59,000
that one thing but the one thing is the

743
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
system it's how all this stuff fits

744
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
together and I do not know what the

745
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
answers are in fact I don't even use the

746
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
word answers or solutions I use responses

747
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000
and in coming months I'm going to have

748
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:19,000
franklies on responses to government

749
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
for philanthropy for communities and

750
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
for individuals and these are just

751
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
guesses because I've spent 20 years

752
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
trying to understand the problem and

753
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
that qualifies me to say well no I

754
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
don't think that'll work because of X

755
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
but I don't know what to do Kate.

756
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Yeah have you ever had anyone on the

757
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
podcast who speaks from experience of

758
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
leading and immersed in civil disobedience?

759
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Well yesterday I interviewed Bill

760
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,000
McKibbin who has a very long success

761
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
track record of building movements as

762
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
far as civil disobedience no I have not.

763
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Maybe that could be a cool one for the

764
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
future because I personally you know I

765
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
take my kids to their school right when

766
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
they were changing going to secondary

767
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
school and you go in the classroom see

768
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
these schools and like who's on the wall

769
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Emily and Pankhurst, Suffragette, Scandi,

770
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Martin Luther King it's like all these

771
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
heroes are on the wall and we know that

772
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
every one of them in their day were so

773
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
troublesome so annoying so disruptive

774
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
and yet we celebrate them now for what

775
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
they did to change this big system so I

776
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
deeply believe in the power of civil

777
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
disobedience and nonviolent direct action

778
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,000
to at least try at least to seek to

779
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
persuade presidents and prime ministers

780
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,000
not to open up that oil field and to

781
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
and to transform so all these different

782
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
pieces of pressure but anyway I would

783
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
love to hear you interviewed.

784
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,000
At a deep level this podcast and if I

785
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
keep it going in the future is a form

786
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
of civil disobedience because the

787
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
things that I will be saying are going

788
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,000
to be threatening to the status quo.

789
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Okay okay keep listening.

790
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
But I will take your advice and if you

791
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
could recommend someone for me to

792
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:09,000
interview I will do that.

793
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Oh sure I can.

794
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
So I'm going to lean us into okay what

795
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000
if we we could bend right I'm talking

796
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,000
about a system as a whole now it could

797
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
it could it could bend if we align

798
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,000
enough things or it will break so I

799
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
want us to lean into the possibility

800
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
of bend now and I'm just going to ask

801
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
you from different sectoral points of

802
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
view just kind of going back to short

803
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
first take answers okay so the finance

804
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
system okay from here what would we

805
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
need to do if we were to bend finance

806
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
as it has been created and I'm just

807
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,000
going to recognize that it's entirely

808
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
human construct it's entirely invented

809
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
so we can reconstruct it but we are

810
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
where we are right now what do you think

811
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
could be done to make it start to move

812
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
towards bend other than what what I see

813
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
seeing coming is is a great big snapping

814
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,000
sound and that's the simplification.

815
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:07,000
So on on each of these topics there is

816
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
a what to do now what to do at the

817
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
moment of a crisis and what to do like

818
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,000
that's more sustainable in 30 or 40 years

819
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
30 or 40 years from now the financial

820
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
system should be smaller leverage that

821
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
got us into this weapons of financial

822
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
mass destruction should not be allowed

823
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,000
the currency should be tethered to

824
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:34,000
something real like land or energy

825
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:39,000
production but for us to do that now

826
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
given the gargantuan you know 100

827
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,000
trillion a day and currency swaps and

828
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:49,000
things like that you can't get there

829
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:55,000
what needs to be done to avoid break is

830
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
if we go back to a 2009 moment when we

831
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
were on the cusp of all the banks in the

832
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,000
world failing and they came through

833
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:10,000
with tarp and the bazookas of central

834
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
banks and government guarantees which

835
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
many of which are still 14 years later

836
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:20,000
in operation if that were to happen

837
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
again I think there should be a bend

838
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
not break strategies within central

839
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,000
banks and governments to maintain

840
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:31,000
transaction capacity and there's going

841
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
to have to be haircuts they're going to

842
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
have to be haircuts at banks people

843
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:38,000
won't be able to have own everything

844
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
that they think they own which is

845
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
itself an information hazard to talk

846
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
about on a podcast but this is not this

847
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
is popular in in earth sciences but in

848
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
the broader public sphere this isn't

849
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,000
that popular of a podcast all sorts of

850
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
things there that governments can

851
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:01,000
respond to the things that will make the

852
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
financial system more stable would break

853
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
the financial system right now this is

854
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
the problem we should have a carbon tax

855
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
the carbon tax would prick the bubble

856
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:17,000
of our debt fueled central bank led

857
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
orgy of consumption so I think

858
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,000
gradually if we were to put a small tax

859
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:32,000
on currency transactions gradually if

860
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
we had money creation that was tethered

861
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,000
to ecological services or pro-social

862
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:42,000
outcomes that's some aspect of what we

863
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
had kind of like a local currency but

864
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:49,000
at a national level have this I'm just

865
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
totally thinking out loud right now

866
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
have it have it generated in a way that

867
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:57,000
you can pay some portion of your taxes

868
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:00,000
in this parallel currency but that

869
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
parallel currency gets issued for doing

870
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
things aligned with the donut for

871
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
instance that minimizes our consumption

872
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
and keeps us within planetary boundaries

873
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,000
the that kind of makes sense in an

874
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:20,000
intermediate term in the short term

875
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,000
though here's the thing is the things

876
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:26,000
that would solve our financial overshoot

877
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
we're doing the exact opposite we're

878
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:31,000
doing more of those things that make the

879
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:34,000
bubble bigger which gets back to the

880
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
minsky thing so I think the way to

881
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
prepare for that is to prepare

882
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,000
individuals communities supply chains

883
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:47,000
businesses for disruption so that

884
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:52,000
they're not so beholden to a sudden

885
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
disruption in a material inputs from

886
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:58,000
across the world etc a reshoring of

887
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
basic needs and if that reshoring is

888
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
effective then the break scenario becomes

889
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
less likely I wish the Belgian

890
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:10,000
currency theorist Bernard Lietar was still

891
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,000
alive because I would have loved to hear

892
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
you have him on this podcast he just

893
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
recently died right he was on my list to

894
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
he died a few years ago yeah he was I

895
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
think the way he talked about the design

896
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
of money and the need for an ecosystem of

897
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
monies and currencies massively influenced

898
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
me and I would have just loved to hear

899
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
him contribute to the kind of designs

900
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
you were starting to come up with there

901
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
somebody who comes to my mind often with

902
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
this podcast is Stephanie Kelton one of

903
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,000
the leading theorists known in relation

904
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
to modern monetary theory and I would

905
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
just love to hear lots of people on

906
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Twitter said I want to hear Nate talk

907
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,000
about modern monetary theory does he know

908
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
about it what does he think about it and

909
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
I really really hope you'll have her on

910
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
this podcast and you may profoundly

911
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
disagree but I think you'd really

912
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
respectfully listen and try and figure

913
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
out where's the overlap in your world

914
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
views or you may really agree but what

915
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
would be your take on modern monetary

916
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,000
theory right now I will answer that but

917
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I'll preface it with this it is a

918
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
challenge and this is why I do the

919
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
franklies because a lot of my guests

920
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,000
first of all I invite people on that A

921
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:25,000
have some some credible expertise

922
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:31,000
on a thing and B that it's relevant to

923
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
the great simplification and C that

924
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
they're good people but what ends up

925
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,000
happening is a lot of times I agree

926
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
with my guests a lot on issue number

927
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:46,000
one and issue number two I totally

928
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
disagree with them but I can't spend

929
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
the whole I'm not a debater I don't

930
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
like want to stomp on their words and

931
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
try to disagree with people at every

932
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
point that I disagree with them so I've

933
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
learned and I've gotten better at this

934
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,000
over time I let the guest do 80 or 90

935
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
percent of the talking and then on my

936
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:12,000
franklies I kind of bookend it with

937
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,000
with my world view but it's it's

938
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
challenging and if you end up being a

939
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,000
host I'm sure you're so gracious and

940
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
diplomatic that that'll be not a problem

941
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
for you but I'm actually happy with that

942
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
because I'm kind of a talker my girlfriend

943
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
says it's my best skill as I just talk

944
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
so naturally I didn't naturally I have a

945
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:39,000
podcast but I've I have become a better

946
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:42,000
listener and who knows I may be really

947
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
wrong about some of these things and my

948
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
guests are absolutely right and that's

949
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
why the the universe of ideas and this

950
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
is in a sorts peer review in real time

951
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,000
of of talking and there's no way it can

952
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:00,000
be perfect but I do I am learning and

953
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:03,000
there are there are huge issues of

954
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:08,000
complexity that are present Stephanie

955
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Kelton I've heard wonderful things about

956
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
her I have friends that know her I will

957
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
ask her to be on the show MMT I think of

958
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
as follows modern monetary theory

959
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
describes the money creation process

960
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
better than conventional financial theory

961
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,000
and it is true that a sovereign nation

962
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:36,000
doesn't really need to worry about their

963
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,000
debt because they can issue currency at

964
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,000
will and so I think the the the water

965
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:50,000
works of describing treasury debt

966
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:56,000
taxes money creation by MMT are correct

967
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:01,000
however MMT makes the same fatal flaw

968
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:04,000
as neoclassical economics on how it

969
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
treats energy productivity and

970
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,000
resources and when we create money we

971
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:13,000
are in balance in the world in the

972
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
monetary world but we're out of balance

973
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:19,000
both ecologically and specifically with

974
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
respect to the carbon pulse energy and

975
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
materials and when we create new money

976
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:26,000
we're not creating new copper or trees

977
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,000
or oil so I think the problem with MMT

978
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
is we end up at the same place with the

979
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,000
great simplification is we have

980
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
governments those governments that can

981
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
print their own money and that's another

982
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
thing that gets into the inequalities

983
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
and global disruptions because of using

984
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
the dollar as the reserve currency of

985
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
the world there's a lot of countries

986
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
that are tethered to the dollar and they

987
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
can't create their own dollars but we

988
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
can but I think we end up in the same

989
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
place is that we're creating too many

990
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
monetary claims versus an underlying

991
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:05,000
energy and material reality and that's

992
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
going to result in inflation and

993
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:10,000
eventually in the lack of trust in

994
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,000
other countries have towards a currency

995
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:16,000
as evidenced by the recent slight

996
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,000
downgrade in the US credit rating by

997
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Moody's so is that a short enough

998
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
overview yeah that was that was just

999
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
the right length and it makes me all

1000
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,000
the more look forward to hearing you and

1001
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Stephanie talk and I don't know what the

1002
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
outcome would be but I think you know I

1003
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
really appreciate talking about the

1004
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
difference between the podcast where you

1005
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
give space to the person you're

1006
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
interviewing and I'm experiencing it

1007
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:43,000
right now there's lots and lots of things

1008
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:45,000
coming up I know I can imagine you would

1009
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,000
see you're doing a great job because you

1010
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,000
probably would want to be pushing back

1011
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
on a lot of the things I'm saying it's

1012
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
hard right because you push back on

1013
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,000
everything it would be a four-hour

1014
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
conversation there we go and you think

1015
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
okay I'll let that go I'll let that go

1016
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
but I'm gonna follow this thread so I

1017
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
understand that and but here's the other

1018
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
thing Kate is you and I are close friends

1019
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
so we could go back and forth and

1020
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
respectfully disagree with each other

1021
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:13,000
and learn but some of these guests I've

1022
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
never met before and I had one and for

1023
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
me to say come on are you serious to

1024
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
someone I just met that's just not my

1025
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
golden retriever Midwest upbringing

1026
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
it's really helpful to hear you articulate

1027
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
the reason for the franklies around on

1028
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
right on the side and that that's a very

1029
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
nice like your little kind of release

1030
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,000
valve on the side but yeah I was going

1031
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
to say I wonder if you could sometimes

1032
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
invite people who you've already

1033
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
interviewed or you've got to know and

1034
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,000
you and just have a session we say we

1035
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,000
respectfully disagree let's celebrate

1036
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
that isn't that interesting I respect

1037
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
you but I really disagree with your view

1038
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
on that I just wish there was more

1039
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
debate in the world that just said hey

1040
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
let's celebrate we respectfully disagree

1041
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
let's listen and find the edges of our

1042
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,000
own understanding without trying to

1043
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
win this we're all trying to move

1044
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
forward so anyway just a thought I think

1045
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
you could you could bring some of those

1046
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
into the podcast in the future I'm going

1047
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
to keep us moving so we're leaning into

1048
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
the possibility of Bend and I'm looking

1049
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,000
forward to the episode that you do in the

1050
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
future with Stephanie Kelton because I

1051
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
think and I think a lot of people would

1052
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,000
love to hear that do you know her I do

1053
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Stephanie you've got to come on this

1054
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,000
podcast okay okay we're going to move to

1055
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:31,000
education and you teach and are well

1056
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:35,000
aware of the power of teaching and that

1057
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
moment where students are in brought into

1058
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,000
a world view so I want to know from you

1059
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
if we are going to Bend at the systemic

1060
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
level what do you think needs to change

1061
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
in the world of education in terms of

1062
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
the concepts that are taught in terms of

1063
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
the kind of skills that the students

1064
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
are taught what it means to be well

1065
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
educated for the 21st century and you

1066
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
can answer this across any discipline

1067
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
you choose or even beyond academia but

1068
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
what needs to change in the way we

1069
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
educate this generation

1070
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
almost everything needs to change and

1071
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
just to clarify I stopped teaching three

1072
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
years ago because I was I was just too

1073
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
busy with other things but I did teach

1074
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
for eight years and I miss it it was the

1075
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:19,000
most rewarding thing I've ever done and

1076
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,000
per my message I left you I'm happy to

1077
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
guess lecture your your class in the

1078
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
future

1079
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
I'm actually trying to construct a

1080
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
roundtable maybe you would like to be

1081
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
part of it

1082
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Jean-Marc Giancovici and Simon Michaud

1083
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:38,000
and Sandra Faber who's a

1084
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,000
physicist and ask them how do we need

1085
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
to change it the academy what are the

1086
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
questions that we should be asking

1087
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
postdocs and graduate students for their

1088
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
research ahead of the great

1089
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,000
simplification I think there's so many

1090
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
aspects of the education system that

1091
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
are tethered to the super organism and

1092
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,000
energy and systems blind that we

1093
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
really need to change

1094
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,000
probably all levels of education I think

1095
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
we need to start teaching ecology and

1096
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
systems to grade schoolers

1097
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:15,000
because it by the time they get to

1098
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
college age my my students they

1099
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
haven't learned a lot of of these

1100
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
basics

1101
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,000
what are colleges now we were

1102
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
supposed to back in the day have a

1103
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
liberal education so that everyone

1104
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
understood a little bit about how the

1105
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
world work but over time

1106
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
they've morphed into came done with

1107
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
high school now to get a higher paying

1108
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
job I have to get this degree it's less

1109
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
about learning as it is to get a rubber

1110
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
stamp of I got this degree now I can

1111
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
make 25% more money

1112
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
and I think we're going to need more

1113
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
education on

1114
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
how to human how to

1115
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
be a human

1116
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
which includes your psychological

1117
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
spiritual emotional physical

1118
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
well-being

1119
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
we don't teach that at all that's going

1120
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
to be central in this world of

1121
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
deteriorating mental health

1122
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
how do we have skills that are

1123
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
actually going to apply to

1124
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
the future that we're headed towards

1125
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
and how do you understand

1126
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
the systems ecology of the world

1127
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
sure math

1128
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
is important

1129
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
but you know the

1130
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
ecology and history and brain

1131
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
science and anthropology

1132
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
and just

1133
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I mean

1134
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
the topics I cover in my course reality

1135
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
101 that should be kind of

1136
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
a 101

1137
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
for all freshmen to understand

1138
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
the world we face

1139
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
so

1140
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
and to go right back to where we began

1141
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
with energy blindness I guess

1142
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
you'd say there's got to be an energy

1143
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
what eyes wide open

1144
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
education that everybody should

1145
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
learn to

1146
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
see sense and be aware

1147
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
of

1148
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
deep dependence upon the flows of energy in the

1149
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
world because it's if it's the currency of life

1150
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
we better get with it

1151
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
yeah

1152
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I mean

1153
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
one of the complaints

1154
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
my students complained to

1155
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
me and to the dean that at the end

1156
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
of the semester I taught them all kinds

1157
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
of things about how the world worked and how

1158
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
messed up it was but I didn't

1159
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
give an answer

1160
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
and they were paid

1161
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
to learn and have the answer

1162
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
but I didn't have an answer and he was very upset

1163
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
about that

1164
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I don't think there are answers

1165
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
but we have to empower young

1166
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
people with

1167
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
not a rose tinted

1168
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
but an actual view of our reality

1169
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
to

1170
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
in a way that we pass the baton to them

1171
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
in an encouraging and empowering way

1172
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
to do things

1173
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
but I do think it's a disservice

1174
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
to

1175
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
shovel the uncomfortable aspects under the

1176
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
carpet and ignore them because they're too

1177
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
young and they can't handle that

1178
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
I don't subscribe to that

1179
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
and just picking up on that question of

1180
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
you didn't give an answer

1181
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
I mean I've heard you say before

1182
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
also in relation to this podcast

1183
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
and in relation to

1184
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
the world view you bring forward

1185
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
it's more, I said

1186
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
I experience it more as a

1187
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
this is what I see

1188
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
this is the context I see

1189
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
I'm trying to explain the system

1190
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
that I see that we're in

1191
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
but you sit much more there

1192
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
and here's how I think we should solve it

1193
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:30,000
is that a fair description

1194
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
of the place in this ecosystem

1195
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
of making things visible

1196
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
and the solution to sit

1197
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
Yes, but if you squint

1198
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,000
and look forward

1199
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
it's kind of obvious

1200
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
what the direction of the things

1201
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
we're going to need to do and a lot of the things

1202
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
are in your work

1203
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
on the donut

1204
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
we're going to need to live

1205
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
instead of just as individual

1206
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
lone wolves we're going to have to

1207
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
expand our interaction

1208
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
with others social capital is

1209
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
critically important

1210
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
and we're going to have to

1211
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
probably have less

1212
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
material consumption

1213
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
and how to prepare for that ahead of time

1214
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
and prepare for that in your communities

1215
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I mean how we get from here

1216
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
to there could happen multiple

1217
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
different ways

1218
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
next week I have

1219
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
a round table on poverty

1220
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
and I think

1221
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
there's great inequality

1222
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
in the world between countries

1223
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
but there's even larger inequality

1224
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
in countries including my country

1225
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
and your country

1226
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
and I think that's going to be a huge

1227
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
story in the next decade

1228
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
is the amount of

1229
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
haves

1230
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
the amount of have nots

1231
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
is going to increase a lot

1232
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
we're going to have wider and deeper poverty

1233
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
and of course we'll try to

1234
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
overcome that

1235
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
with stimulus and social

1236
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
programs but eventually there will be limits

1237
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
to that so how do we

1238
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
where does college fit in

1239
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
with that? Is it even the best

1240
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
choice

1241
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
for an 18 year old

1242
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
headed into this world

1243
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
but yeah you're right I'm more

1244
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,000
trying to describe our situation

1245
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
in a politically neutral

1246
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
science tethered way

1247
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
and pass that

1248
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
baton to as many humans that

1249
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
will listen

1250
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
which is another issue Kate

1251
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
this podcast is not for everyone

1252
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
I could

1253
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
with more funding

1254
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
broadcast it so that I paid

1255
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
for social media views and got

1256
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
a lot more people to watch it

1257
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
and this is not a message

1258
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
for everyone that is

1259
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I want to force on people

1260
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
it's kind of a low bandwidth

1261
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
bat signal that I'm sending out to the world

1262
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
and those people that resonate

1263
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
with it

1264
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
those are my sort of people

1265
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
and I want to be as honest as I can

1266
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
be in what I think

1267
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
with them there's a completely

1268
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
different set of messaging

1269
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
that needs to happen

1270
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
for the general public, for students

1271
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
for community leaders, for Hollywood

1272
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
for governments

1273
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
and that's more than I can handle

1274
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
at the moment but messaging

1275
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
is very important

1276
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
and I'm just trying to be

1277
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
authentic and describe

1278
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
what I see now

1279
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
and maybe I should do more thought

1280
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
in crafting

1281
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
discrete pathways

1282
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
that are helpful to people

1283
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
and of course there are people

1284
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
among students and community leaders

1285
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
and Hollywood and political leaders

1286
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
who are your listeners of this podcast

1287
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
and maybe they are also

1288
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
taking it and translating it

1289
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
or making it accessible to their communities

1290
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
in ways that only they

1291
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
from within that community know

1292
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
how that will fly

1293
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
that actually is my deepest hope

1294
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
is that I don't know

1295
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
how these conversations

1296
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
are changing the actions and behaviors

1297
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
and emergence of others

1298
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
I do have another call, a second call next week

1299
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
with an executive at HBO

1300
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
that wants to do a series

1301
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
on the great simplification

1302
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
writ large, like a six part series

1303
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
and we're kind of talking

1304
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
about what that might look like

1305
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
so yeah, the time now

1306
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
is for this cultural conversation

1307
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
and it's not just climate

1308
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
and it's not just

1309
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
politics, it's

1310
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
a large

1311
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
systems, human

1312
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
species level

1313
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
conversation

1314
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
and

1315
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
you and I are part of that

1316
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
conversation and it's evolving

1317
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
and I'm going to break around

1318
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
to ways that we could lean

1319
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
into the possibility of Bend

1320
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
okay, you've shared what you'd say

1321
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
about changing education, what about changing

1322
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
and this is massively broad

1323
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
but what about changing

1324
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
policy making

1325
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:54,000
just think of policy makers

1326
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
in

1327
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
a country, I'm going to start with a country

1328
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:00,000
in the global north

1329
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
they're involved in

1330
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
industry or sector

1331
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
that is material and energy intensive

1332
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
and they came to you and said

1333
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
how can I start

1334
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
changing to help Bend

1335
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
what can I

1336
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
think differently, do different tools, language

1337
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
world view

1338
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
I know this is a massive question

1339
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
what can you see that could start

1340
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
helping if there was

1341
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
if we believe that this couldn't fail then critical

1342
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
mass could actually build amongst policy makers

1343
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
what would you want to see a critical mass

1344
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
of building

1345
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
it is a massive question

1346
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
in fact every question you've

1347
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
asked me could be its own one hour

1348
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
podcast

1349
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
I've included that

1350
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
policies that actually could

1351
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
be implemented right now

1352
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
are only at the margin

1353
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
the conversation that needs to happen

1354
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
is so, so much bigger

1355
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
on what we're going to have to do in the next decade

1356
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
so I coined the phrase

1357
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
advanced policy which is those things

1358
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
that we will have to do

1359
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
but that are politically and

1360
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
socially unacceptable now

1361
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
and so the biggest thing

1362
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
is to educate

1363
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
the current leaders and future leaders

1364
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
as possible about how

1365
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
these pieces fit together

1366
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
and

1367
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
build constituency and research

1368
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
and work on what

1369
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
they will have to do

1370
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
when we go into energy

1371
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
security and rationing

1372
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
and

1373
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
the early stages of the simplification

1374
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
in the global north now that's

1375
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
a different answer for corporations

1376
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
and businesses

1377
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
that would have more to do with

1378
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I mean here's the thing

1379
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
we

1380
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
so revere efficiency today

1381
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
but

1382
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
efficiency makes things less resilient

1383
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
and

1384
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
on the downslope once the economy

1385
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
starts to decline

1386
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
efficiency

1387
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
the Jevons paradox will become a Jevons

1388
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
dividend because if we

1389
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
get 5% more

1390
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
efficiency in how we use energy

1391
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,000
that means whatever our

1392
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
decline is is 5% less

1393
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
so

1394
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
the challenge now is

1395
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
to look two or three steps ahead

1396
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
on what are the technologies

1397
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
that society are going to need

1398
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
in the next 10 or 20 years

1399
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
and start

1400
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
looking at that instead

1401
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
of what consumers are demanding now

1402
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
but how do you do that

1403
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I mean it's really hard

1404
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
because your market is what

1405
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
people are buying today

1406
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
so I come back to

1407
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
education

1408
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
and systems

1409
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
are the no regret strategies

1410
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
and I mean you're doing fantastic

1411
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
work with deal

1412
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
and donut on the ground

1413
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
in cities

1414
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
I just don't see that we're going to

1415
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
get off of

1416
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
fossil carbon because of ammonia

1417
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
and cement and

1418
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
concrete and fertilizers and all the

1419
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
other things

1420
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
but to prepare for less

1421
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
and less intricate global

1422
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
supply chains

1423
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
is something to be considered

1424
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
I've talked to a lot of politicians

1425
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
and this is like too big

1426
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
of a thing for them to bite off

1427
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
so

1428
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
but I think it

1429
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
five years ago this sounded crazy

1430
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
and now they're nodding their heads

1431
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
starting to listen

1432
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
is there anything that you think

1433
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
people are already doing

1434
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
right

1435
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
towards

1436
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
bending

1437
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
at least that's in motion

1438
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
at least that's building mass

1439
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
well I think psychologically

1440
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
there are millions

1441
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
or tens of millions of people

1442
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
that are already

1443
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
the walking worried that

1444
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
know that our culture is approaching

1445
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
an inflection point

1446
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
and so they're

1447
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:00,000
supportive

1448
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
they're doing things

1449
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
more locally

1450
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
they're meeting their neighbors

1451
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
they're maybe growing a little food

1452
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
I mean this is without understanding

1453
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
climate change or oil depletion

1454
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
or debt overshoot or anything

1455
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
they're just

1456
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
responding

1457
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
from the cultural signals

1458
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
I mean you're probably a better person

1459
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
to ask that question

1460
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
look at all the on the ground

1461
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I think that the biggest thing

1462
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
is that we're starting to talk

1463
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
about this in lots

1464
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
of different places

1465
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
and that talking kind of breaks the seal

1466
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
of creativity

1467
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
and working together

1468
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
and different

1469
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
different projects

1470
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
it's just that little flame

1471
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
is so tiny relative

1472
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
to the media and

1473
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
the cultural conversation

1474
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
and the Super Bowl

1475
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
and the advertising on TV

1476
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
that you need to buy

1477
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
this extra little thing

1478
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
for your house and you'll be happy

1479
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
so I think

1480
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
many of us are growing up

1481
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
and waking up

1482
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
to our reality

1483
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
and

1484
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
I think that itself is a good thing

1485
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
and needs to continue to scale

1486
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
by the way

1487
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
this is

1488
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
this is

1489
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
a darker conversation

1490
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
than I anticipated

1491
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
is it not

1492
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
it feels like I'm kind of a curmudgeon

1493
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
here

1494
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I'm not trying to put you in a curmudgeon corner

1495
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I'm inviting you

1496
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
to talk about the possibility of bend

1497
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
yeah well

1498
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
but that's where you okay

1499
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
that's interesting that's where you are today

1500
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
yeah it's where I am today

1501
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
but I mean I also

1502
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
who am I

1503
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Kate to tell

1504
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
people how I think

1505
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
that what they should do

1506
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I also

1507
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
feel like

1508
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I do understand how the system

1509
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
fits together and I've spent a lot of time

1510
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
on biophysical economics

1511
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
but that doesn't qualify me to be some

1512
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
advice person

1513
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
for people's lives

1514
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
I know the general direction

1515
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
because I'm still

1516
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
trying to figure out what to do in my own life

1517
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
okay

1518
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I'm just going to pick up

1519
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
there something I was going to bring later

1520
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
who might

1521
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
be an advice person

1522
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
and I hear you saying

1523
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
I'm witnessing I'm just saying what I'm seeing

1524
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
but I don't want to be giving advice

1525
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
but I'm going to come back to

1526
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I want to come into the place of the difference between

1527
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
the podcast and the franklies

1528
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
and you've explained a little bit

1529
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
quite clearly actually the difference

1530
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
and the reason for both and that makes sense

1531
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
to me

1532
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
but your franklies are sometimes very strong

1533
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
like very strong opinion

1534
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
and you might not be giving advice

1535
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
but the strength in which

1536
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
with which you give your opinion

1537
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
influences people

1538
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
and it shapes

1539
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
many people's

1540
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
perception of what is or isn't possible

1541
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:08,000
so it has a big effect in the world

1542
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:10,000
and I just want to

1543
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
lean into that a little bit more

1544
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
to ask you

1545
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
to hold that

1546
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
this is my opinion

1547
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
and you know that you've got a big audience

1548
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
this is my opinion and sometimes

1549
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
for many people it can feel very dark

1550
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
like well we're just going to keep using the oil

1551
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
whereas so many people are

1552
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:30,000
mobilizing in every way they can

1553
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
to move us off that

1554
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
and to move us into not renewables

1555
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,000
but solar based energies

1556
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
it feels very

1557
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
heavy

1558
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
to hear you say

1559
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
keep using it up

1560
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,000
and I just want to ask you how you hold

1561
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
knowing that it is influential

1562
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
and it might not be advocacy and advising

1563
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
but it has impact on

1564
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:54,000
people's sense of what's possible

1565
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:56,000
I do have a strong opinion

1566
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,000
of the global macro

1567
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
economy

1568
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
and I actually don't think that

1569
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
the tragedy is we're going to use

1570
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
more oil

1571
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
per se I think it's

1572
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
the economy unwinding

1573
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
to prepare for

1574
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
and we are going to use less oil

1575
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
because we won't be able to afford it

1576
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I think that's the default path

1577
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
the franklies

1578
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
if I had my druthers

1579
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:26,000
I would do one a day

1580
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
and I have hundreds of topics

1581
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
that I would like to

1582
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
opine on

1583
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
and it's interesting Kate

1584
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
something really strange has happened

1585
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
since I started doing these franklies

1586
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,000
I go for like a bike ride

1587
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
or a walk

1588
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,000
and I organize things in my head

1589
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
and I come back right here

1590
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
and I turn the camera on and I just riff

1591
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
and 9 times out of 10 that's the final thing

1592
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
and sometimes I say something

1593
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
and my staff is like no you can't say that

1594
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,000
you need to redo it

1595
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
but I've gotten better at speaking

1596
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
in like 15 minute

1597
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
extemp summaries

1598
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
but I can no longer write

1599
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I've lost the ability to

1600
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
dense those thoughts into

1601
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,000
you know

1602
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
1500 word essay

1603
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
and so this

1604
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
it's like working out certain muscles

1605
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
I've been talking on this

1606
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
podcast and these franklies

1607
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
but I think the franklies

1608
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
at their core

1609
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
are a systems integration

1610
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
of multiple topics

1611
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
that I've spent 20 years thinking

1612
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
about and researching

1613
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
and talking to other experts

1614
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
and so it's where the disciplines

1615
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
overlap

1616
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
and merge is where the discovery

1617
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:42,000
and interesting things are

1618
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
okay

1619
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
here's a question you invited me to ask

1620
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
which I appreciate

1621
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
where might you be wrong

1622
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I asked you to ask me that

1623
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
yeah you did

1624
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
I think I want to start asking that of all my guests

1625
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
you absolutely should

1626
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I think that's a great idea

1627
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,000
um

1628
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
when I ran

1629
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
the oil drum and now that

1630
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
I run this podcast I get emails

1631
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
from so many people

1632
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
that are all so

1633
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
unbelievably sure about

1634
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
their world view

1635
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,000
and I think it's part of the human condition

1636
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,000
especially with

1637
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
middle-aged and older men

1638
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
that they have this

1639
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,000
unbelievable certitude

1640
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,000
of their world view and their opinion

1641
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
and I think that is part of the human condition

1642
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
and I'm a middle-aged

1643
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
older man and therefore

1644
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
I have to recognizing that

1645
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
handicap my certitude by some amount

1646
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I feel

1647
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
confident about these things

1648
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
but I know that humans are

1649
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
oftentimes delusional

1650
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
and don't actually see

1651
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
things that they can't see

1652
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
so I'm sure that I'm wrong

1653
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
about many many

1654
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
things in what I'm talking

1655
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
about at the

1656
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
margin because I'm trying to stay on top

1657
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,000
of neuroscience and plastics

1658
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,000
and oil depletion and things

1659
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
are moving so fast that I can't

1660
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
stay up

1661
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
on the core things I really don't think

1662
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,000
I'm wrong because I've

1663
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:20,000
looked at them so many times

1664
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
humans are biological

1665
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
organisms were

1666
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
mammals were primates were

1667
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
predators were related to

1668
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
all other things

1669
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
that are alive on the planet

1670
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:34,000
and we're a product of our evolutionary

1671
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
past and that has a bearing on our behaviors

1672
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I don't think

1673
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
I'm wrong about that energy is

1674
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
the currency of life and how much

1675
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
net energy we have access to

1676
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
dictates what's possible

1677
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
in the human sphere and this

1678
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
energy that we've been using

1679
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,000
is depleting

1680
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
and we've been

1681
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,000
alive during a part where it was

1682
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
growing not depleting

1683
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,000
and so we're

1684
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:02,000
immune to the imagination of

1685
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
what can happen afterward I don't know

1686
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
what's going to happen afterward

1687
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
but I can infer it

1688
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
and most importantly

1689
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,000
the natural world

1690
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:14,000
is being

1691
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,000
severely impacted by the human

1692
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,000
endeavor and

1693
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,000
this is kind of a shifting baseline

1694
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,000
sort of thing we don't see it

1695
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
every day every day looks much like

1696
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
yesterday but over decades and over

1697
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
centuries it is absolutely

1698
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
deteriorating

1699
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
relative to the way it was

1700
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,000
I don't think I'm wrong

1701
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
about those larger

1702
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,000
arcs

1703
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,000
but I definitely could be wrong about some

1704
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
things for instance what is the role of

1705
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,000
technology

1706
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,000
what is the role of governance

1707
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
what is the role of cultural evolution

1708
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I don't think I'm

1709
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
really wrong about those things because

1710
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I'm not deterministic in what they will

1711
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,000
be

1712
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
I am

1713
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
still learning Kate

1714
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:04,000
aren't we all

1715
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
and since you talked about

1716
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:08,000
your own identity

1717
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:10,000
in this I'm just going to come in on that

1718
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,000
here's me a white British woman sitting at

1719
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Oxford in the United Kingdom

1720
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,000
and there's you

1721
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,000
white presenting North American man

1722
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,000
in the US

1723
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
what do you think

1724
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,000
that there may be

1725
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
things that people like you and I can't

1726
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
see that are trends in the world

1727
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:30,000
that matter in the world

1728
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:32,000
just some reflections on what

1729
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:34,000
other people dissimilar

1730
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
from us might know or be able

1731
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,000
to see or sense that we can't see

1732
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,000
now that's a kind of tricky question

1733
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:42,000
tell me what you can see that you can't see

1734
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,000
but you get where I'm going

1735
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,000
fortunately I have a lot of friends

1736
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
internationally many of them

1737
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:50,000
have been guests in this show and I hope to do

1738
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:52,000
more international

1739
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
guests in next year

1740
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
that this

1741
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:58,000
everyone has a different

1742
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:00,000
perspective and what they care about

1743
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,000
is different and I think we need to hear

1744
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:04,000
a lot more

1745
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
voices on how people

1746
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
process this and how they respond

1747
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,000
to it this is one

1748
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
of my biggest challenges right now there's

1749
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
38% of the listeners of this

1750
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,000
show are in the United States

1751
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,000
which means 62%

1752
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
are in other countries

1753
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
I live in the

1754
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:24,000
United States my social connections

1755
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
are largely here when I talk

1756
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,000
about bend versus break

1757
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,000
and the great simplification

1758
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
ostensibly I mean for this

1759
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:34,000
country because we are

1760
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
totally unprepared for what's coming

1761
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,000
and yet there are people

1762
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
in Kenya and Ethiopia

1763
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
and Lebanon

1764
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
and Ukraine listening

1765
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
and watching this podcast I know

1766
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
because they email me

1767
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:50,000
and the message for them might be totally

1768
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,000
different than the message for people

1769
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,000
living in Minneapolis or Topeka, Kansas

1770
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,000
and so I

1771
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,000
really struggle with that

1772
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
and I want to stay on

1773
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:02,000
target of how does this

1774
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
system science fit together

1775
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:06,000
of our predicament

1776
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
and what are the behavioral policy

1777
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,000
economic

1778
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:12,000
and biological ways out of it

1779
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:14,000
but I also want to

1780
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,000
like you said I want to highlight

1781
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:18,000
the voices that can

1782
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:20,000
see things about this that

1783
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:22,000
a biophysical economist could not

1784
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,000
and I'll need help

1785
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
on finding those voices

1786
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
but I hear you

1787
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
on that

1788
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Yeah and just reflecting that

1789
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
for my own economics education

1790
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:36,000
economics was founded on the

1791
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:38,000
worldviews of

1792
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
people from the global north with land

1793
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,000
and so they saw some things

1794
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:44,000
and they missed a heck of a lot of things

1795
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,000
and in my own

1796
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,000
rethinking of economics

1797
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
it's been when you go to other people

1798
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:52,000
from the global south from women's voices

1799
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,000
from working class backgrounds

1800
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
people who come from elsewhere

1801
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,000
where those economists where they just bring

1802
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
that 360 degree completely other perspective

1803
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,000
and as you said earlier

1804
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
like none of us can know

1805
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
everything none of us can see everything

1806
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,000
it takes that ecosystem

1807
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:10,000
of using experience to help

1808
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:12,000
fill in the gaps

1809
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
of our own understanding

1810
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
our ability to empathize or learn

1811
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
about other places so

1812
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
here's to ecosystems of knowledge

1813
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
and podcasts right back to the value of a podcast

1814
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
just so many different voices

1815
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,000
I can definitely think

1816
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:28,000
of people you could invite on

1817
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
who would bring much more of that perspective

1818
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:32,000
and I'm sure many of your listeners can too

1819
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,000
so

1820
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:36,000
can you move us towards the classic closing questions

1821
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
okay the questions that you

1822
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,000
ask people every week

1823
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
and make sense to ask them to you

1824
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,000
are you ready

1825
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:46,000
yes

1826
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
okay

1827
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
what would be

1828
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:52,000
a practical response to the metacrisis

1829
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:54,000
that would be most effective

1830
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
for people to take

1831
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,000
Nate that's a really big question

1832
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,000
do you ask people that

1833
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
just like straight off the bat

1834
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,000
do you feel how massive that is

1835
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:18,000
well this is why I do that

1836
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:20,000
is because

1837
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
everyone has a factual

1838
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,000
expertise Helen Thompson

1839
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
was on last week talking about

1840
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:28,000
money and energy

1841
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:30,000
and geopolitics

1842
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
and she gets asked those personal things

1843
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
and I frankly don't know what she thinks

1844
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,000
about the great simplification

1845
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,000
other than she specifically

1846
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,000
predicts energy

1847
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
security problems

1848
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
in the next five years

1849
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:46,000
so I like to

1850
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,000
I mean my belief is

1851
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
we're headed for a time

1852
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
when we need to have

1853
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
the head, the heart and the hands

1854
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
acting in unison

1855
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
and so much of the podcast

1856
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
sphere is about the head

1857
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,000
you know analyzing things

1858
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,000
so I

1859
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
append these questions

1860
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
at the end of the interviews

1861
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
to get at the heart

1862
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
of the human that is on the show

1863
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
nice

1864
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
because I think our humanity

1865
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
and

1866
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:20,000
our honesty and our care

1867
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
and who we are as individuals

1868
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:24,000
is going to be as

1869
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:26,000
or even more important than the facts

1870
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:28,000
we know about the world

1871
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:30,000
so that's why I asked those

1872
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:32,000
and I'm thinking about mixing them up

1873
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
a little because it's been a hundred episodes

1874
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
but

1875
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
we do get really interesting

1876
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
answers

1877
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
what do we do about the metacrisis

1878
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
it depends where you are

1879
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,000
I think the I mean I have a hundred

1880
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
pieces of advice

1881
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
but the main one

1882
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
is

1883
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
try to not go through

1884
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
this

1885
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
as an individual

1886
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
find a group of like-minded people

1887
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
on your values

1888
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,000
find a group of like-minded people

1889
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:06,000
on

1890
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
doing things

1891
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,000
meeting the future halfway in your community

1892
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
or in your company

1893
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,000
or in your neighborhood

1894
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
and find a group of people that

1895
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:18,000
you like to have fun with

1896
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,000
and do things that are unrelated to the metacrisis

1897
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
and feed your soul

1898
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
those groups, those three groups

1899
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
end up being the same group of five or six

1900
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:28,000
or seven friends or maybe they're different

1901
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,000
but finding

1902
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
the dining car on this

1903
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,000
runaway train

1904
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:36,000
with like-minded people

1905
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
is an important thing to do

1906
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:42,000
one of my problems is

1907
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
I eat, sleep and breathe

1908
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
the metacrisis, my girlfriend now

1909
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I have a rule that if I'm on the phone call

1910
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,000
with

1911
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
a group of people

1912
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Daniel or

1913
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:56,000
DJ White or Rex Weiler

1914
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,000
or Art Berman

1915
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:00,000
I have to leave the house

1916
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
she's tired of hearing about this stuff

1917
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
and I don't blame her

1918
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,000
so

1919
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,000
try to have balance as well

1920
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
and I think

1921
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,000
there's a lot of things that are out of our control

1922
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
so that means

1923
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:16,000
try to control one or two things

1924
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
about your future

1925
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,000
and I try to do that

1926
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
and I think ultimately

1927
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
where we are as a culture

1928
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,000
what

1929
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
really needs to change is a culture

1930
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,000
which is to

1931
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:32,000
recognize that most of this consumption

1932
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
is

1933
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:36,000
not making us healthy

1934
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
or happy

1935
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:40,000
and that once basic needs

1936
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,000
are met the best things in life

1937
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:44,000
are mostly free

1938
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,000
and for a lot of people the basic needs aren't being met

1939
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,000
if we look at the macro things

1940
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,000
of what our society needs to do

1941
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
we can start

1942
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
to attempt to try to change those things

1943
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,000
in our own life and you see how

1944
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:58,000
difficult it is

1945
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
to reduce the

1946
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:02,000
siren song

1947
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:04,000
of immediate gratification

1948
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:06,000
with either food or entertainment

1949
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
or novelty or stimulus

1950
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:10,000
and do the longer term

1951
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:12,000
thing like reading a book

1952
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,000
or planting something or tending a garden

1953
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
and so

1954
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
if we really want to live more sustainably

1955
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,000
as a culture I think that

1956
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,000
starts within

1957
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:24,000
and that's a struggle for me

1958
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,000
that I'm going through all the time

1959
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
so

1960
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:30,000
I'm sure people have heard me talk a lot

1961
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:32,000
about what I recommend

1962
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:34,000
and I'll have more stuff but that's a

1963
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:36,000
short response

1964
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Okay and specifically what recommendations

1965
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,000
for young humans

1966
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
who are becoming aware of this

1967
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
and may have stumbled across

1968
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:46,000
this podcast had it recommended

1969
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:48,000
by a teacher by a friend

1970
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
suddenly burst into this

1971
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:52,000
awareness

1972
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
of this world that was probably not centered

1973
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
to their education and here they are

1974
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Do you use the word young humans or were you just mimicking me?

1975
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
You use the word young humans

1976
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
What do you say young people?

1977
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:04,000
Young people but you know let's go with young humans

1978
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:06,000
Okay

1979
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,000
Young humans

1980
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,000
keep learning

1981
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:14,000
find

1982
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:16,000
like-minded people to travel

1983
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
like I just said

1984
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
find

1985
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,000
things that you're really interested

1986
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:24,000
in and care about

1987
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:26,000
learn skills

1988
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:28,000
that would be useful

1989
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,000
imagine the great simplification

1990
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:32,000
happening

1991
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:34,000
in your community

1992
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
what would you want to be

1993
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
involved in and responsible for

1994
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,000
and partake in and start

1995
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
thinking about that

1996
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,000
The world will probably be

1997
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
worse than many of us

1998
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
expect but probably a lot

1999
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
better than many of us fear

2000
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,000
and don't let fear

2001
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,000
dominate your life

2002
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:58,000
I'm trying to

2003
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:00,000
with this podcast

2004
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,000
give a broad arc of

2005
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
what's happening and

2006
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
if you just happen upon a podcast

2007
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
without knowing all the back

2008
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,000
story leading up to it

2009
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:12,000
it can be a little overwhelming

2010
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
and my best advice for that is

2011
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:16,000
listen to it or process it

2012
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:18,000
with a group of other people

2013
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,000
or a friend

2014
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
and talk about it

2015
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,000
talk about these things

2016
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,000
get out in nature and get off your phone

2017
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:28,000
as much as possible

2018
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
those will be some of the pieces of advice

2019
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
Nice

2020
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
How can listeners reshape the way

2021
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:36,000
they think

2022
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
in order to best face the future

2023
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,000
I don't think we can change

2024
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
human behavior not on a dime

2025
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
I think we can shift

2026
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
we can create

2027
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,000
we can use our cognitive skills

2028
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:52,000
to

2029
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,000
create speed bumps

2030
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,000
in the future for the ghost

2031
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,000
of dopamine past and our emotional

2032
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,000
proclivities

2033
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I think we can change how we think

2034
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
via

2035
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
awareness

2036
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
and meditation

2037
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:10,000
and having a little Kate or a little Nate

2038
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,000
on our shoulder chiming in

2039
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
and observing and commenting

2040
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
on what we're doing

2041
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
and

2042
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,000
try to find people that

2043
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
disagree with you and steal man

2044
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
their arguments and then

2045
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
come back to

2046
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
what you originally thought

2047
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,000
and you might have a deeper appreciation

2048
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
of the topic

2049
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,000
and keep thinking in systems

2050
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
on how things

2051
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:38,000
fit together

2052
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
but don't all only think

2053
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,000
I mean thinking is part of the problem

2054
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:44,000
that we're always just thinking

2055
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:46,000
we have to also live

2056
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
in the moment

2057
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:50,000
We are now heading home woods

2058
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:52,000
Are you ready?

2059
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
What do you care about most?

2060
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
What do you think I care about most?

2061
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,000
What are you asking you?

2062
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,000
I care about the natural world

2063
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:04,000
and other species

2064
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
that have no voice in our economic system

2065
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:08,000
or on

2066
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,000
the bend or break scenario

2067
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,000
and

2068
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,000
this

2069
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:16,000
still is the only planet

2070
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
that we are certain

2071
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
has life and complex life

2072
02:00:20,000 --> 02:00:22,000
in the whole universe

2073
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,000
and this

2074
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:26,000
slowly unfolding

2075
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
you know

2076
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
metacrisis

2077
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
has a large

2078
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
back-ended cost

2079
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
on the natural world

2080
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:40,000
and I care mostly about that

2081
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I care about a lot of things which is

2082
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
part of the cross

2083
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
that I bear with this work

2084
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
but I care about other species

2085
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,000
insects, birds, mammals

2086
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:52,000
trees, forests

2087
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,000
at the end of the day

2088
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:56,000
that's what I care about most

2089
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
And especially dogs

2090
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Yeah

2091
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I care about dogs a lot

2092
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
I've seen you with dogs, I've seen dogs passing in the street

2093
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:06,000
and you just like

2094
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
a whole other Nate comes out

2095
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,000
everything else has swept away

2096
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
there's a doggy on the pavement

2097
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
we're going to put the dogs aside a moment

2098
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,000
come back

2099
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
what is one thing you worry about

2100
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,000
for the next 10 years?

2101
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:22,000
Well of course I would answer that

2102
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:24,000
every day

2103
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
but I think the thing that

2104
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
worries me the most

2105
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
is what I care about the most

2106
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:32,000
is the natural world

2107
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,000
and I think

2108
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,000
we are approaching this

2109
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:38,000
cultural awakening moment

2110
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
of concern

2111
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
for the biosphere and climate

2112
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
and oceans and other species

2113
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:46,000
and it's growing in the media

2114
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:48,000
and I think that could be

2115
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
upended by

2116
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,000
energy scarcity, energy poverty

2117
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
and economic problems

2118
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,000
and a rightward shift politically around the world

2119
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:58,000
and that all of this

2120
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
burgeoning

2121
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
environmental awareness

2122
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:04,000
is going to go to the

2123
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
back burner

2124
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
in our cultural focus

2125
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
and it will become more dangerous

2126
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,000
to outwardly

2127
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:14,000
talk about these things

2128
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
relative to today

2129
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
that's one of the things that I worry about

2130
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:20,000
not only because

2131
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
I have a podcast about nature

2132
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:24,000
and systems but because

2133
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
now is the time that that needs

2134
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:28,000
to be prominent in our decisions

2135
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,000
because ultimately

2136
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
what's best for nature

2137
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:34,000
and ecosystems is also

2138
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
best for humans in the long run.

2139
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
Indeed.

2140
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,000
What is one thing you have hope

2141
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,000
about over the next 10 years?

2142
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,000
I have hope

2143
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:46,000
in conversations like this

2144
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,000
and I told you this in Sweden

2145
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:50,000
is there are so many

2146
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:52,000
pro-social

2147
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
smart people

2148
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
that are starting to get it

2149
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
and starting to put things together

2150
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:00,000
and starting to ask how do I change things

2151
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
at my university, at my company

2152
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
I've been giving presentations to

2153
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
corporations

2154
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
that want to understand

2155
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
how this affects their business

2156
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
so we have arrived at

2157
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:14,000
how all these things fit together

2158
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,000
and it's really politically

2159
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,000
and socially difficult

2160
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:20,000
to say these things out loud

2161
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,000
but it's starting

2162
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:24,000
and that gives me hope

2163
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:26,000
is these conversations are becoming

2164
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,000
less BS and

2165
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,000
more

2166
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
tethered to reality

2167
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,000
that's a little scary but it's also hopeful

2168
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,000
that we're going to have

2169
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
an emergent response to some of these

2170
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
events on the horizon.

2171
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
If you could

2172
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
wave a magic wand

2173
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,000
with no personal recourse

2174
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
to do one thing to improve the

2175
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:50,000
future

2176
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:52,000
what would you wave it at?

2177
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
So the reason I

2178
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
phrased that question that way

2179
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,000
is waving a magic wand with no personal

2180
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
recourse

2181
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
is different than being a president

2182
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,000
or a prime minister

2183
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
because a president and a prime minister

2184
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:10,000
could have a

2185
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:12,000
dictum or a policy

2186
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,000
but they're still beholden to their

2187
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
constituents who voted them

2188
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
and could vote them out.

2189
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,000
A magic wand

2190
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:22,000
presumably is do whatever

2191
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,000
you want

2192
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,000
and it doesn't matter what other people think.

2193
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,000
You could go for dictator too but I quite like

2194
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
the magic wand alternative.

2195
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
I would

2196
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
change

2197
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,000
how people

2198
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
change the lens

2199
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:44,000
with which they view

2200
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,000
their own lives and their existence to a

2201
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
wider boundary one

2202
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
and view that everything is connected

2203
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:52,000
and that we're part of

2204
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:54,000
this long

2205
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:56,000
evolving

2206
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,000
social biological

2207
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:00,000
experiment that brought us

2208
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
to this moment and to care

2209
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:04,000
beyond

2210
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:06,000
their own tiny sphere

2211
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,000
into caring about other people

2212
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
other generations and ecosystems

2213
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,000
and I think a lot more things

2214
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:14,000
would be possible if we expanded

2215
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,000
the lens

2216
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:18,000
of where we

2217
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:20,000
measure our own boundaries of the self.

2218
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,000
If you had, I'm going to give you six months

2219
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:26,000
just

2220
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,000
open up a little

2221
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,000
window in the fabric of

2222
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
time and you just get this

2223
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
pocket of six months to dive

2224
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:36,000
into one topic and explore it

2225
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,000
however you want, what are you going to dive into?

2226
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,000
The human brain

2227
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
and how to

2228
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:46,000
quiet down

2229
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:48,000
the dopamine consumption

2230
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
treadmill that we're on

2231
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,000
and to heal

2232
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:54,000
and come from a place of

2233
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:56,000
equanimity

2234
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
and view

2235
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:00,000
the purpose of

2236
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:02,000
one's life and one's work

2237
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:04,000
towards the betterment of the future

2238
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:06,000
rather than

2239
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
individual

2240
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
dopamine cascades

2241
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:12,000
and social status

2242
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:14,000
and monetary piles of digits

2243
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
and

2244
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
really what would that take

2245
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
from a neuroscience

2246
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:22,000
slash cultural

2247
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:24,000
slash sociological perspective

2248
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
to heal more humans

2249
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
and

2250
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
involve them in a

2251
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
purpose for the greater good

2252
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
given the challenges we face.

2253
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Is there any question I haven't asked you

2254
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
that you're now thinking, oh, I really wish there was

2255
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
this question in the podcast that she'd asked me

2256
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
because I actually want to answer that.

2257
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,000
No, this is

2258
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
this has been great.

2259
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,000
I'm going to carry on with this.

2260
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
It feels

2261
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:54,000
like it's

2262
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:56,000
something that I was supposed to do

2263
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,000
which is my kind of Midwest

2264
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
you know

2265
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
golden retriever

2266
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:06,000
sort of personality interviewing

2267
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,000
scientists and activists

2268
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,000
on what we face

2269
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:12,000
and then peppering in the franklies

2270
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:14,000
to give kind of a

2271
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:16,000
goofy color commentary on some

2272
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:18,000
aspect.

2273
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I hope it continues

2274
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:22,000
to scale and that

2275
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:24,000
it's inspiring

2276
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,000
others to have these

2277
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,000
conversations at their dinner table

2278
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,000
at their town meeting or at their

2279
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:32,000
their companies

2280
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
and

2281
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
if it happens

2282
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,000
and there's an episode 200

2283
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I may invite you back to

2284
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:42,000
interview me again. Boy, what a world

2285
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
will be at that point.

2286
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Fantastic, thank you very much

2287
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:48,000
and again, of course, this is my show this week

2288
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
so thank you very much, Nate
