Welcome to another episode of The Great Simplification. Today, I'm very pleased

00:05.320 --> 00:12.800
to welcome my friend and self-described renegade economist Kate Rayworth. Kate

00:12.800 --> 00:18.760
is known for her book, Donate Economics, Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st Century

00:18.760 --> 00:25.200
Economist, and the related lab that she co-founded, Donate Economics Action Lab,

00:25.240 --> 00:29.720
which is putting into practice the planetary boundaries and human

00:29.720 --> 00:35.520
sufficiency in the doughnut around the world. She's also a senior associate at

00:35.520 --> 00:40.440
Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute, as well as a professor of

00:40.440 --> 00:46.920
practice at Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. She's an incredible

00:46.920 --> 00:51.720
communicator, and I think her work on doughnut economics is painting a picture

00:51.760 --> 00:55.880
that people can understand, that we are part of a broader system that we're

00:55.880 --> 01:02.160
influencing, and the current economic rules and institutions are not

01:02.160 --> 01:08.080
only creating environmental overshoot, but they're really not doing a great

01:08.080 --> 01:13.560
job for the humans. This was an incredible conversation. I hope to have Kate

01:13.560 --> 01:19.600
back on various reality roundtables. She's doing very important work. Please

01:19.680 --> 01:21.200
welcome Kate Rayworth.

01:32.880 --> 01:34.000
Kate, great to see you.

01:34.120 --> 01:35.200
It's great to be here.

01:36.120 --> 01:36.960
How are you?

01:37.040 --> 01:37.400
I'm well.

01:37.400 --> 01:38.600
You are very busy, I imagine.

01:39.040 --> 01:44.320
Yeah, I think everyone's busy, right? We can all make busy, but I'm well, and

01:44.880 --> 01:46.840
I'm really looking forward to this conversation, obviously.

01:47.760 --> 01:51.920
Thank you for all the important work you're doing. Your book, Doughnut

01:51.920 --> 01:56.600
Economics, and your ongoing work with Doughnut Economic Action Lab are

01:57.240 --> 02:03.720
influencing and inspiring a lot of people, so thank you. Let me ask you a

02:03.720 --> 02:10.520
question. Many of us that worked in finance and economics had kind of a

02:10.520 --> 02:16.760
aha moment where we left the dark side. For me, it was 20 years ago on

02:16.760 --> 02:21.360
Wall Street reading Herman Daley's book, but you're a classically trained

02:21.360 --> 02:27.400
economist, now an ecological economist. What were some of your aha moments

02:27.400 --> 02:32.720
that caused you to pause and like, wait a minute, do you have any acute

02:32.760 --> 02:33.960
stories or memories?

02:34.280 --> 02:39.160
So I studied economics at university in the 1990s. I had the, what's the

02:39.200 --> 02:42.920
opposite of an aha moment? It's like, oh, no, moment, that kind of, oh, no,

02:42.920 --> 02:46.400
moment when, you know, I've come to study economics because I care about the

02:46.400 --> 02:49.800
environment. There's no paper on the environment at all. There was nothing.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.640
It was like one week in public economics, you know, a company paused

02:53.640 --> 02:58.520
chemical gloop in the river, that kind of, that was it. When we talked about

02:58.520 --> 03:02.920
inequality, it always would begin with taking initial income distribution as

03:02.920 --> 03:07.600
given. Would this Pareto change, improve things? And I was like, why, why

03:07.600 --> 03:11.640
do we take income, things as given? Why don't we start with asserting human

03:11.640 --> 03:15.480
rights? So I had quite a lot of, oh, no, this isn't turning out to be the tool

03:15.480 --> 03:19.240
kit. I was really hoping it would be, which is why when I left university, I

03:19.360 --> 03:22.800
didn't want to call myself an economist. I actually walked away from it for

03:22.800 --> 03:27.040
many, many decades. But then make, like many other people, I had those aha

03:27.040 --> 03:31.840
moments that started bringing me back. So one of the first ones was seeing the

03:31.840 --> 03:35.840
planetary boundaries diagram. I have it actually right here. It's, it was seeing

03:35.840 --> 03:39.480
it into my brain. I came back from maternity leave. And somebody showed me

03:39.480 --> 03:44.880
this. And it was a massive, oh, that's the beginning of 21st century

03:44.880 --> 03:49.080
economics. Because like you, I had just read Herman Daley's book, Beyond

03:49.080 --> 03:55.840
Growth. That made my brain flip. And when I saw this picture in 2010, I was

03:55.840 --> 03:59.640
thinking, well, the, the, Joanne Rockstone, Will Steffen and the planetary

03:59.640 --> 04:04.040
boundary scientists, they have quantified that biosphere around the economy

04:04.040 --> 04:08.200
that Herman Daley drew. He conceptualized it. They quantified it. And we are

04:08.200 --> 04:12.560
game. We are on. Here we go. And that's why I drew a circle within a circle and

04:12.560 --> 04:15.920
created the donor. That was a massive aha moment for me. Somebody else then

04:15.920 --> 04:18.920
mentioned a couple of years later, well, of course, the work of Danela Meadows

04:18.920 --> 04:22.120
thinking in systems, I'm like, that sounds interesting. What's that? Then when

04:22.120 --> 04:27.680
I read thinking in systems, it was a massive aha. There is no turning back

04:27.680 --> 04:33.040
from this. And why wasn't I taught economics in systems thinking? Why

04:33.040 --> 04:36.480
weren't we taught to think of the economy as a complex adaptive system in

04:36.480 --> 04:41.040
feedback loops? So it was a real deep frustration with what I'd been taught

04:41.040 --> 04:44.640
and, and just a thrill of finding these ideas. And it was this collective

04:44.640 --> 04:48.800
series of aha's that made me think, I want to make these ideas dance on the

04:48.800 --> 04:53.640
same page. That's what led me to read, to write donor economics. I want to see

04:53.640 --> 04:56.480
what happens when you bring Eleanor Ostrom's comments theory together with

04:56.480 --> 04:59.560
Danela Meadows thinking in systems together with Herman Daley's ecological

04:59.560 --> 05:03.640
economics together with feminist economics. What do we get next? So it was

05:03.640 --> 05:06.400
definitely these aha moments that brought me back.

05:06.800 --> 05:12.520
Why don't we teach thinking in systems and, and these planetary boundaries and

05:12.520 --> 05:16.120
some of the things you just mentioned to undergrads in college?

05:18.120 --> 05:22.840
Because the mainstream economic textbook and thinking and the ideology

05:22.840 --> 05:28.800
behind it is a self contained self affirming system that has worked very

05:28.800 --> 05:34.000
well nicely. Thank you for decades and carries on being taught and students

05:34.000 --> 05:38.560
keep enrolling for economics. And I think there's a real inertia of

05:40.560 --> 05:46.440
self questioning when inside the discipline. And why disrupt something

05:46.440 --> 05:50.120
that has apparently been working? I mean, to me, the most radical act in

05:50.120 --> 05:54.400
economics would be to draw Herman Daley's circle of the biosphere around

05:54.440 --> 05:58.880
every single model of the economy. Why don't we do that? Because that's what

05:58.880 --> 06:04.360
changes everything. And I think there's it changes the professor's

06:04.400 --> 06:07.920
professionalism, it changes who is the expert here, it changes the

06:07.920 --> 06:13.480
foundations of analysis. So it causes a massive disruption in the

06:13.480 --> 06:16.000
hierarchies that have been built up around which are the best journals,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.960
which are the best frameworks, what's taken as given, I mean, supply and

06:18.960 --> 06:22.240
demand curves, they haven't been peer reviewed, the exponential growth

06:22.280 --> 06:26.360
curve for an economy that was never peer reviewed. But it's just taken as a

06:26.360 --> 06:30.400
foundational assumption now. So it's much harder to move away from that

06:30.400 --> 06:33.600
system because everything and if we knew paradigms, well, has it been

06:33.600 --> 06:38.240
peer reviewed? So I think that's why we see the build up of new economic

06:38.240 --> 06:42.720
thinking often outside major economics departments because the new

06:42.720 --> 06:46.440
thinking is coming from elsewhere rather than within. But what thrills me is

06:46.440 --> 06:50.120
that students in high school, whether they're, you know, 14 year olds or

06:50.120 --> 06:52.480
whether they're 18 year olds or whether they're undergraduates or

06:52.480 --> 06:56.880
master students, they know that the ideas that will serve them to be

06:56.920 --> 07:01.920
economists, household managers, right? Planetary scale, household managers

07:01.920 --> 07:04.440
of the future, they know that the ideas that will serve them are not the ones

07:04.440 --> 07:07.400
that are contained only in those textbooks, they are coming to these

07:07.400 --> 07:08.080
new ideas.

07:09.040 --> 07:14.000
So I taught for eight years a class called Reality 101. And in my

07:14.000 --> 07:18.920
experience, the students that had never had an economics class, like

07:18.920 --> 07:23.240
immediately got the content in my class. But it was the ones that had had an

07:23.240 --> 07:27.560
economics class that there was this like mental speed bump they had to get

07:27.560 --> 07:31.600
over on the assumptions and other things. It was very interesting to

07:31.600 --> 07:32.160
observe.

07:32.400 --> 07:36.280
Yeah, and there's a great quote from Cain, he said something like, it's not

07:36.280 --> 07:40.160
the new ideas that are difficult. It's getting the old ones out of our heads

07:40.160 --> 07:43.720
that have been ramified into the corner of our minds. How do we escape

07:43.720 --> 07:50.200
paradigms? So that to me is why I care most about, let's call it Econ 101, I

07:50.200 --> 07:53.520
care most about the first course that any student encounters, often

07:53.520 --> 07:58.200
professors, when they're pushing back against what I'm doing, they say, Oh,

07:58.200 --> 08:02.200
you know, you're just talking about Econ 101. I mean, it gets far more

08:02.200 --> 08:06.000
sophisticated than this. I would argue it doesn't, they don't suddenly bring

08:06.000 --> 08:09.120
the planet in when you're when you're a master student or something. But the

08:09.120 --> 08:13.240
very first encounter we have with what is the economy, what is the range of

08:13.240 --> 08:18.000
its scope? What are the foundational metrics? Is it price in the market? What

08:18.000 --> 08:22.120
are the foundational institutions that we care about? These profoundly shape our

08:22.120 --> 08:25.280
worldviews and pictures profoundly shape our worldviews. That's what I've

08:25.280 --> 08:29.840
really learned, the power of pictures. And so if you want to dislodge a model, I

08:29.840 --> 08:33.360
think the best way is to propose a new model, right, Buckminster Fuller, right?

08:33.400 --> 08:37.800
You change things by making the old model obsolete, propose something new. So

08:37.800 --> 08:41.800
that's why the work I've done is really focused on proposing new pictures,

08:41.800 --> 08:47.600
because the power of our visual sight, going into our visual cortex, it really

08:47.600 --> 08:51.880
shapes what we see and what we don't see, what's central, what's peripheral. So

08:51.920 --> 08:55.080
that's to me, the most important economics course to change.

08:56.280 --> 09:01.560
Well, let's let's get into that. Your very popular book, Donut Economics,

09:02.360 --> 09:08.120
highlighted the outer core, or the outer ring, which is the planetary boundaries

09:08.120 --> 09:14.240
that we don't want to exceed. And then the inner ring was the human needs for

09:14.240 --> 09:18.960
well being, the things that we don't want to go below. And in it, talking about

09:18.960 --> 09:27.440
visuals and orthodox economics, you outlined a list of old economic thinking

09:27.440 --> 09:34.320
like 20th century and new 21st century economics. And maybe you could either

09:34.320 --> 09:38.280
visually or we could put up one of your graphics, just give a kind of a brief

09:38.280 --> 09:40.800
summary of the, I think you had seven points.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.600
Yeah. So first of all, let me say that it was really important to me what I was

09:44.600 --> 09:49.000
aiming to do in that book was to set out ways of thinking, right? It's principles

09:49.000 --> 09:53.240
of thinking that will then be adapted over time between different countries that

09:53.240 --> 09:58.360
will be relevant differently in Malawi or Sweden, but also that'll change over

09:58.360 --> 10:03.320
time as suddenly AI appears or as crises hit. So I wasn't trying to say these are

10:03.320 --> 10:06.960
other policies that we should implement, but rather, what are some of the ways of

10:06.960 --> 10:11.000
thinking that will equip us to go well? And I'm sure there's many more. But yeah,

10:11.000 --> 10:15.480
here's seven. And I'm just for the fun of it with you. I'm going to see if I can

10:15.480 --> 10:19.080
show them quickly visually. This is going to be kind of like a doughnut economics

10:19.080 --> 10:22.600
circus big tent. So let's see if I can do this. So seven ways to think the first

10:22.600 --> 10:28.440
one, change the goal. The goal of 20th century economics was endless growth,

10:28.440 --> 10:31.440
right? There we go. Endless growth curve. It was just implicitly underlying

10:31.480 --> 10:36.240
everything that we said we were aiming for, success of the economy. No, that is

10:36.240 --> 10:40.520
not a sufficient statement of what success looks like. And we know that

10:40.520 --> 10:44.560
endless growth actually takes us into a lot of problems. So we need, here we go,

10:44.560 --> 10:47.880
the doughnut that you just described, a goal that says, leave no one falling

10:47.880 --> 10:52.000
short in the hole, but don't overshoot Earth's limits. Get everybody over the

10:52.000 --> 10:56.000
social foundation inside the ecological ceiling. We want to meet the needs of all

10:56.000 --> 10:59.280
people within the means of the living planet. It's a goal that brings together

10:59.280 --> 11:03.280
human rights and ecological integrity. And I say, okay, that's the starting point

11:03.280 --> 11:07.320
on day one. Bang, this is where we begin. What kind of economic system will

11:07.320 --> 11:13.120
actually take us there? So number one, change the goal. Two, see the big picture,

11:13.120 --> 11:18.080
right? If that's the compass, what's the map? The map of economics. All mainstream

11:18.080 --> 11:23.200
economics courses start with this little diagram, supply and demand. Now, that's a

11:23.200 --> 11:27.600
big act to put supply and demand on the screen on day one. It means we put the

11:27.600 --> 11:31.360
market at the center of our vision. It means we make price, the metric of

11:31.360 --> 11:34.920
concern, and everything that falls outside the price contract gets called an

11:34.920 --> 11:38.760
externality. That's a big framing choice of the death of the living world. Oh, it's

11:38.760 --> 11:42.640
an environmental externality. That is not nearly a big enough picture. There are

11:42.640 --> 11:46.120
no externalities, as Herman Daley and I would say. Your model is just not big

11:46.120 --> 11:51.560
enough. So I drew a diagram. Here's my embedded economy diagram. Here you go.

11:51.560 --> 11:55.600
Let's see if we can show this. So this brings together ecological economics. It

11:55.600 --> 12:00.840
brings together complexity. It brings together feminist economics and

12:00.840 --> 12:06.720
common thinking. The economy is embedded in society, is embedded in the living

12:06.720 --> 12:10.480
world. It is a subsystem and utterly dependent upon it. But also the economy

12:10.480 --> 12:14.160
is made up not just of the market in the state, that very 20th century boxing

12:14.160 --> 12:18.520
match, the household, the space of unpaid caring work, typically done by women, and

12:18.520 --> 12:23.040
the commons and an Ostrom space where we co-create goods and services of value. If

12:23.040 --> 12:26.160
we start with this big picture of the economy and recognize that all economic

12:26.160 --> 12:30.840
activity has to operate within the planetary boundaries and we can use

12:30.840 --> 12:35.360
these different forms of provisioning, to me this is just so much a richer

12:35.360 --> 12:41.400
starting point for all macroeconomic modeling. So number two, change, get

12:41.400 --> 12:47.040
the big picture. Number three, nurture human nature. Who is humanity? How do we

12:47.040 --> 12:50.360
tell ourselves the story of who we are in this picture? The portrait of

12:50.400 --> 12:55.560
humanity. In 20th century economics, this guy, here we are, he's framed. This is

12:55.560 --> 12:58.960
a rational economic man. I decided to draw him to make him visible. He would be

12:58.960 --> 13:03.760
a man standing alone, no dependence. He's got money in his hand, he's got ego in

13:03.760 --> 13:08.160
his heart, he's got calculator in his head, and he'd have nature at his feet. He

13:08.160 --> 13:11.960
hates work, he loves luxury, he knows the price of everything. The real problem

13:11.960 --> 13:17.360
with this depiction is that the more the students told, oh yes, this model is a

13:17.840 --> 13:23.040
sufficient model of us. Actually, we start to mimic him. Students say over time

13:23.040 --> 13:28.880
they more value competition and self-interest over altruism and

13:28.880 --> 13:32.040
collaboration because they start to mimic the model. So who we tell ourselves we

13:32.040 --> 13:36.320
are, shapes who we become. Instead of this rational economic man, we need to

13:36.320 --> 13:40.520
recognize we are first the most social of all mammals. We are social, we are

13:40.520 --> 13:46.160
adaptable, we are heuristic, we care about other's opinions, we follow the

13:46.160 --> 13:51.960
crowd, we are learning. So we have to start with the reality of humanity, which

13:51.960 --> 13:56.600
we learned from cognitive behavior, psychology, from sociology, a much richer

13:56.600 --> 14:01.160
picture of humanity. Now before, we've got to get savvy with systems. So instead

14:01.160 --> 14:06.080
of assuming the economy is in equilibrium, like that supply and demand curve

14:06.080 --> 14:09.480
showed us, recognize that it's almost probably never going to be there. It's a

14:09.480 --> 14:13.440
complex adaptive system. For this, my favorite shape, little donut, springs into

14:13.760 --> 14:20.440
a complex adaptive system of interlinked dynamics, reinforcing feedback, balancing

14:20.440 --> 14:25.240
feedback, tipping points, delay, resilience, redundancy. That's the world of

14:25.240 --> 14:29.360
D'Nelamedo's. So think of it as a complex adaptive system that will ever be

14:29.360 --> 14:33.280
evolving. We can't control it. There's no levers to pull. The best we can hope for

14:33.280 --> 14:38.120
is to steward that system. So how do we want to steward that system? We want to

14:38.120 --> 14:43.640
steward it away from being deeply divisive. We've inherited a divisive

14:43.640 --> 14:46.760
economy that captures value and opportunity in the hands of a few. Here's

14:46.760 --> 14:51.800
the rise of the 1%. We need to turn it, steward that system into a much more

14:51.800 --> 14:55.960
distributive economy. There we go. A system that shares value and opportunity

14:55.960 --> 15:00.080
with all who co-create it. How can we make a distributive economy? So from

15:00.320 --> 15:05.600
divisive to distributive, second big dynamic that we can steward in this

15:05.600 --> 15:10.280
complex adaptive system is from linear and degenerative, stick it in the pipe

15:10.280 --> 15:14.080
of production, make staff throw it away. That's what pushes us over plentary

15:14.080 --> 15:19.280
boundaries into a circular or cyclical regenerative economy where we use

15:19.280 --> 15:22.480
resources again and again from a collectively, carefully, creatively

15:22.480 --> 15:27.040
and slowly. So from degenerative to regenerative, from divisive to

15:27.040 --> 15:32.600
distributive. And then this takes us to the seventh principle that what is the

15:32.600 --> 15:36.440
future of economic growth? What does the future look like? And I'm coming

15:36.440 --> 15:40.480
back to where we began. The presumption was economies would just keep growing

15:40.480 --> 15:45.080
forever. This says, well, maybe actually we need to be agnostic about growth

15:45.080 --> 15:48.440
because what we really want are regenerative economies and distributive

15:48.440 --> 15:51.680
economies. And there might come some point, indeed, they probably have already

15:51.680 --> 15:55.440
come to it, especially in high-income economies where they need to grow up,

15:55.480 --> 15:59.680
right? Nothing in nature succeeds by growing forever. It goes through a

15:59.680 --> 16:03.560
growth phase and then it grows up and matures. What would it mean to create

16:03.560 --> 16:06.920
economies that actually mature? Because if we don't do that, we're going to get

16:06.920 --> 16:10.960
that. We're going to induce collapse, which is something very close to your

16:11.640 --> 16:15.680
heart and focus and thoughts, right? So how can we not break? How can we bend?

16:16.080 --> 16:19.960
How can we bend this system so that actually matures and grows up? So those

16:19.960 --> 16:23.720
are the seven ways to think. And let me just say again, that's just seven. Those

16:23.720 --> 16:26.800
are the ones that became really clear and obvious to me. I bet there's more.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.680
And I offer people to keep adding to them.

16:31.760 --> 16:32.520
Bravo.

16:33.160 --> 16:33.720
That was fun.

16:33.760 --> 16:39.480
I might have to make this entire interview a best of clip. That was very

16:39.480 --> 16:42.680
impressive. Thank you so much for your work. While you were doing that, I

16:42.680 --> 16:47.440
wondered if you hadn't chose being an economist, you could have been like a

16:47.440 --> 16:52.240
stand-up comedian. And this stuff is not funny, though. That's the problem,

16:52.240 --> 16:57.920
right? You have such a good delivery and are clearly very knowledgeable and

16:57.920 --> 17:03.320
passionate. But these are really serious topics that we need to pass the baton

17:03.320 --> 17:09.720
to our youth and people all around the world. And yeah, it feels good because

17:09.720 --> 17:16.120
we're on the right side of the ledger of humanity and the biosphere. But we're

17:16.120 --> 17:24.160
in a very tough moment. And what you just described, I just fantasize about

17:24.400 --> 17:29.680
leaders when Danela Meadows was working on these things in the 70s, had we

17:29.680 --> 17:35.160
adopted some of this thinking then, but we were in the thralls of massive

17:35.160 --> 17:41.000
energy surplus. The thing that I would add to your list is economics has

17:41.000 --> 17:49.320
focused on cost, not value. And energy for what we pay for, just the cost of

17:49.320 --> 17:55.520
extraction, gives orders of magnitude more value to the human enterprise than

17:55.520 --> 17:59.800
its cost. That's a big flag in economic theory.

18:01.320 --> 18:08.520
I think for me, what comes very clearly from your work is if I was to go back

18:08.520 --> 18:12.600
and add to what I wrote about a little bit, but more that the fundamental

18:12.600 --> 18:16.960
currency of our economies, if we really want to get down to currency and

18:16.960 --> 18:22.200
evaluation, energy is the second law of thermodynamics. It's the fundamental

18:22.200 --> 18:26.640
currency of life. And so we would do a lot, we would do really well to pay a lot

18:26.640 --> 18:30.440
more attention to energy. Exactly as you just said, it's treated in economics as

18:30.440 --> 18:34.680
a cost and it's, well, it's been very low. But actually to understand energy and

18:34.720 --> 18:38.760
materiality, and I mean materials, the actual real materials of the world and

18:38.760 --> 18:42.960
the relationship between energy use and material use and its boundedness and

18:42.960 --> 18:47.160
its relationship between that and the delicate balance of the ecosystems,

18:47.160 --> 18:51.520
the planetary boundaries, the life support systems of Earth, to understand

18:51.520 --> 18:55.080
the interrelatedness of those things, coming back to a point Satish Kumar

18:55.080 --> 19:00.120
from makes, how can you claim to be an economist if you don't yet understand

19:00.120 --> 19:04.160
ecology, the living world, the systems on which we depend, the cycles on which we

19:04.160 --> 19:09.080
depend, the materials at hand, it's a deeply physical and energy based system.

19:11.120 --> 19:15.000
I've been using this new chart, I'll send it to you after we're done a little

19:15.000 --> 19:21.120
triangle that shows politics, money and technology as describing society. But

19:21.120 --> 19:24.760
then you blow up the screen and that's just a little triangle on the top and

19:24.760 --> 19:30.520
underneath it is this huge energy like flame. And that's underpinning all that.

19:30.560 --> 19:34.760
And then you blow it up even further and underneath that is the biosphere and

19:34.760 --> 19:41.200
the ecosystem services of Earth that support all of that. So I mean, what is

19:41.200 --> 19:47.880
the response from standard economists at your school at Oxford or around the

19:47.880 --> 19:53.920
world? Are they ignoring this message from donut economics or are they

19:53.920 --> 20:00.120
ridiculing it or I mean it just seems like so much obvious common sense. Or

20:00.160 --> 20:05.000
do they secretly agree with you but the incentive structures of status and

20:05.000 --> 20:09.360
tenure and jobs preclude them from publicly agreeing with you?

20:09.800 --> 20:16.000
So when my book first came out in 2017, there was a lot of ignore. That's the

20:16.000 --> 20:18.600
first line of defense, isn't it right? If something's threatening, either

20:18.600 --> 20:24.840
ignore or kill it sort of. And so there's also some ridicule. Or the first

20:24.840 --> 20:28.120
comeback was this isn't economics. Now, oh, no, no, you've put your values in

20:28.120 --> 20:31.600
here. You see by starting with the donut by starting with human rights and

20:31.600 --> 20:36.400
ecological, you started with your values, which astounded me. Maybe wait, when

20:36.400 --> 20:40.840
you start with supply and demand of the market, do you think you're starting

20:40.840 --> 20:46.240
with no values? Do you not realize that everything is starting with a set of

20:46.240 --> 20:50.480
values of what we choose to show, what we choose to measure and what we choose

20:50.480 --> 20:56.480
to call success. But I have to say there are of course there are, well, the

20:56.640 --> 21:00.840
ecological economists started using it immediately because it brought a visual

21:00.840 --> 21:04.400
to what they and the inheritors of Herman Daley's work have been doing for

21:04.400 --> 21:08.680
decades. Feminist economists, urban studies. So outside of economics

21:08.680 --> 21:11.080
departments, many, many other people started using it business schools

21:11.080 --> 21:15.400
because business happens in the world in the materiality of climate impacts and

21:15.960 --> 21:20.520
labor, labor issues. So it made sense to them. And increasingly, there are

21:20.520 --> 21:23.920
people teaching economics in mainstream departments who more and more, I mean, I

21:23.960 --> 21:27.040
only find out about it when I find out about it, right? You only know what you

21:27.040 --> 21:30.480
know, hear of, who get in touch and say, I'm introducing this into my macro

21:30.480 --> 21:33.960
economics class. Partly, I think, because there's a generation of students

21:33.960 --> 21:37.240
coming through who put up their hand and say, what about planetary boundaries?

21:37.240 --> 21:41.440
What about the donut? The demand is coming from the students. That's more

21:41.440 --> 21:45.000
and more where I see that it's come into economics departments because the

21:45.000 --> 21:50.560
student body are born in, you know, the climate strikers are now at

21:50.600 --> 21:55.200
university. And I see that in the group of students I teach myself. And so

21:55.200 --> 22:00.200
they're coming with a much more political economy expectation of their

22:00.200 --> 22:03.000
education and they're expecting to be taught tools that will actually

22:03.000 --> 22:06.800
equip them with the crisis that they've been born into. So they are pushing

22:07.160 --> 22:10.760
that agenda in a really positive way. But I, instead of trying to hammer on

22:10.760 --> 22:14.600
the door of economics departments that are shut, I've never done that. I go

22:14.600 --> 22:17.640
where the energy is, where the interest is, because there's lots of it. And it's

22:17.840 --> 22:24.120
in other departments that are grounded in real world challenges. Like I said,

22:24.120 --> 22:28.440
like urban design, urban studies, architects, doctors actually, doctors

22:28.440 --> 22:31.360
who recognize human health and planetary health are deeply into woven. They're

22:31.360 --> 22:34.600
bringing it into their degrees. So I'm just going with that energy. And I

22:34.600 --> 22:38.080
believe economics, it's a question to economics. Are you, is economics

22:38.080 --> 22:41.680
going to catch up and embed itself in the real world as other disciplines

22:41.680 --> 22:45.200
are doing? And then it will start bringing this in as it is already

22:45.240 --> 22:45.840
creeping in.

22:46.840 --> 22:54.400
Personally, I don't think economics will ever voluntarily give up the throne. I

22:54.400 --> 22:58.000
think we'll have to have a crisis. And then new ideas that are laying around

22:58.000 --> 23:04.600
will replace the the brittle and outdated 20th century models. Perhaps yours

23:04.600 --> 23:08.120
would be one of them. But I don't think they're going to say, Yeah, you know

23:08.120 --> 23:14.400
what, Kate's right. That's just not the way of human status and metabolism. I

23:14.400 --> 23:14.960
don't think

23:15.080 --> 23:19.200
I agree. And that but what I do know is they're going to be crises and

23:19.200 --> 23:23.000
they're coming and more and more that these crises come that and I think it's

23:23.000 --> 23:27.000
in part why the donut framework. Oh, yeah, there we are. This speaks to food

23:27.000 --> 23:32.480
prices and energy and climate impacts. And it it holds that space. But as you

23:32.480 --> 23:36.680
just in passing quoted Milton Friedman, right, when when crises come, people

23:36.680 --> 23:40.360
turn to the ideas that are lying around at the time. And I like to say, Well, why

23:40.360 --> 23:43.800
just leave them lying around? Let's have them up and running. And that's why I

23:43.800 --> 23:48.480
co founded donut economic Action Lab. Because when my book came out, what

23:48.480 --> 23:52.640
thrilled me was that I was approached by people who say, I like the ideas. And I

23:52.640 --> 23:55.920
want to do this. Some of them were teachers in school, I'm teaching this to

23:55.920 --> 23:58.040
the kids now it's not the syllabus, but this is what they should be learning.

23:58.280 --> 24:04.120
Some of them were city councillors, city mayors, state legislators, we want to

24:04.120 --> 24:09.640
put this into practice where we are. So we work with them to start seeding this

24:09.640 --> 24:12.320
possibility. And what does it look like when they actually try and start putting

24:12.320 --> 24:16.400
these ideas into practice so that as crises come, we can say like as of today,

24:16.400 --> 24:20.880
I can say there are 70 city and local state district governments around the

24:20.880 --> 24:24.520
world who've already chosen to start working with this model to bring about

24:24.520 --> 24:29.560
the transition that they know they want to create this seeds and grounds proof of

24:29.560 --> 24:33.800
practice of a concept so that as crisis hit, it's it's got that credibility, it's

24:33.800 --> 24:36.080
got that critical mass of actual practical use.

24:37.080 --> 24:44.600
Yeah, so my podcast and my work is still mostly about educational, but you're

24:44.600 --> 24:49.640
actually taking doughnut economics, the book, the concepts and putting them into

24:49.640 --> 24:55.200
practice in your lab. You just mentioned 70 communities, cities around the world

24:55.200 --> 24:59.640
like, how are they putting them into practice? Can you give some example or

24:59.640 --> 25:01.960
progress updates or interesting stories?

25:02.960 --> 25:06.400
So I can give you an example and that those 70 are of local governments.

25:06.400 --> 25:11.120
There's a whole other group of community organizations starting it up, but local

25:11.120 --> 25:16.520
governments. So the way it, having watched it from it began in April 2020 in the

25:16.520 --> 25:21.600
height of the COVID crisis, Amsterdam, we created a city portrait for them

25:21.600 --> 25:24.760
downscaling the doughnut to the city. What would it mean for this city to aim to

25:24.760 --> 25:27.520
live in the doughnut? And they launched it in the midst of COVID because they said,

25:27.520 --> 25:30.360
well, we're in emergency, we're in a crisis right now. But as we emerge from

25:30.400 --> 25:33.720
crisis, they will be funding, the economy will be opening up again. It's that

25:33.720 --> 25:36.400
question, which direction are we going to go in, right? Don't waste the

25:36.400 --> 25:41.160
opportunity for crisis to change your direction. They introduced it at the

25:41.160 --> 25:45.720
heart of their policy to become a circular city. So they said, they had a

25:45.720 --> 25:50.640
vision to create 100% circular by 2050, 50% circular by 2030. And they

25:50.640 --> 25:54.720
recognize that circularity doesn't just mean changing the flow of materials,

25:54.720 --> 25:58.680
it's not merely materials, it has deep implications for livelihoods, for

25:59.560 --> 26:04.240
distribution, for people's access to transport and food and clothing. So they

26:04.240 --> 26:07.640
wanted to bring the social in, and that's why they saw the doughnut really help

26:07.640 --> 26:11.840
bring together the ecological and social in terms of a bigger vision of a

26:11.840 --> 26:16.360
circularity policy. And that was a good example of a place that already has a

26:16.360 --> 26:21.200
vision for transformation, put it together with their vision to get rid of all

26:21.200 --> 26:26.120
fossil fuel transport in the city by 2030. So they're really transforming

26:26.160 --> 26:30.960
some big systems here. The doughnut serves as a visual clear compass that

26:30.960 --> 26:35.120
brings it all together. And so often that's the way I see it happening. It's

26:35.120 --> 26:39.040
not as if, you know, city mayor sees the doughnut says, oh, that's an amazing

26:39.040 --> 26:43.880
idea. Now what shall we do? It's going to be seen by people in places who

26:43.880 --> 26:48.240
already have this sense of we need to transition, we need to transform our

26:48.240 --> 26:52.800
systems, our energy, our transport, our housing, our food systems. They come

26:52.840 --> 26:57.440
across the doughnut. This really helps bring together these ideas in a clear

26:57.440 --> 27:01.600
way that we can communicate. And it's like a big sale on our ship. It's very

27:01.880 --> 27:05.880
compelling vision. And also we're joining others doing it. I've just come back

27:05.880 --> 27:11.400
from Cunobl in France, where the city have one of the most recent cities to

27:11.400 --> 27:14.320
say, yep, we're adopting the doughnut. So they they downscale it to the

27:14.320 --> 27:18.160
national level, I mean, to the city level. And they actually collect the

27:18.160 --> 27:21.040
metrics. What would it mean for everybody here to thrive? And is our local

27:21.080 --> 27:24.600
ecology thriving? Do we have thriving nature in the city? Are we coming back

27:24.600 --> 27:27.760
with implantary boundaries? And what's our impact on people worldwide through

27:27.760 --> 27:31.480
global supply chains? And what kind of metrics could we collect? So that this

27:31.480 --> 27:35.840
replaces, for example, saying, I'm making the stat up. But for example, they

27:35.840 --> 27:40.080
might say, oh, you know, good knobs, GDP is increased by 1.3% over the last

27:40.080 --> 27:46.080
year. I mean, is that is that good or bad? Or what? How will I know anything

27:46.080 --> 27:50.560
from that? But if I'm measuring the metrics of a place in real terms, in

27:50.560 --> 27:53.440
terms of people's lives, in terms of the ecological health and its impact in

27:53.440 --> 27:58.160
the world, it's, it's a real story and a much more detailed story about what's

27:58.160 --> 28:03.120
happening here. So they've introduced it. They're like many cities transforming

28:03.120 --> 28:08.800
their transport systems, getting reducing cars, bringing in public transit, and

28:08.800 --> 28:13.120
much more cycling. They've introduced a tax on property, actually, because they

28:13.120 --> 28:16.880
said we have huge inequality in our city, we need to reduce the inequalities. So

28:16.880 --> 28:21.760
this is a quite an elected local government with pretty progressive

28:21.760 --> 28:25.760
mandate that are saying, yeah, this helps us go in that direction. And just in

28:25.760 --> 28:30.000
terms of the kinds of actions that I see when I go to cities like Karnob, like

28:30.000 --> 28:34.880
Barcelona, like Copenhagen, what recurs to me again and again is a beautiful

28:34.880 --> 28:39.200
phrase that the environmental journalist George Mombio once wrote. He wrote

28:39.200 --> 28:44.560
about the UK. He said, look, what we have here is private luxury and public

28:44.560 --> 28:49.360
squalor. And what we need is public luxury and private

28:49.360 --> 28:53.680
sufficiency. And when I go to places like these cities, I see, ah, yeah, this is

28:53.680 --> 28:58.720
what public luxury looks like, fantastic public parks, incredible mobility, low

28:58.720 --> 29:05.040
cost, fast, clean, efficient transport, good quality social housing.

29:05.040 --> 29:08.080
And we have private sufficiency. And in France, there's a word that's really

29:08.080 --> 29:11.680
gaining currency, sobriety. If you say sobriety in English, people think, oh,

29:11.680 --> 29:14.560
you're not going to drink alcohol anymore. It's got that very literal meaning.

29:14.560 --> 29:20.320
But sobriety in France means a dignified sense of I have enough. This is

29:20.320 --> 29:25.840
sufficient. My material needs are met. My mind and my intellectual life and my

29:25.840 --> 29:30.080
cultural and common's life is flourishing. But sobriety, it's a, it's a,

29:30.080 --> 29:33.360
it's really interesting to see the way this is gaining traction. In Sweden, they

29:33.360 --> 29:38.240
have a term lagom, which means I have plenty and it's enough. And we need

29:38.240 --> 29:42.560
language like this in more and more cultures to be able to express that

29:42.560 --> 29:46.240
sense of private sufficiency and public luxury. And that's where we should be

29:46.240 --> 29:49.760
seeking abundance. So again and again, I see cities that are actually starting to

29:49.760 --> 29:53.120
put this into practice. That's the vision that they're starting to bring about.

29:53.760 --> 29:59.280
I love it. I have so many questions. So here's, here's the challenge that I see.

29:59.280 --> 30:04.400
Last week, I was in Germany and I spoke to a large audience of climate, energy,

30:04.480 --> 30:09.040
tech investors with the basic messages, we're not going to solve climate change

30:09.040 --> 30:14.240
and help the environment by growing the economy by electric cars and things like

30:14.240 --> 30:21.120
that. And I expected it to not go well, but it went really well. And

30:22.320 --> 30:27.680
like this is a Dinella Meadows thing. You can't understand our situation unless

30:27.680 --> 30:31.920
you look at the whole system. And the people in the room, I told them they

30:31.920 --> 30:38.160
were wearing three hats. One was their hat as the managers of the Sovereign Wealth Fund of

30:38.160 --> 30:44.560
Norway or Fidelity or whatever, where they have to generate returns for their investors. The other

30:44.560 --> 30:51.760
hat was their father, mother, sister, parents, whatever, they want to do the right thing for

30:51.760 --> 30:55.680
their family. And then the third thing is they want to do the right thing for the world as a

30:55.680 --> 31:03.440
citizen of the world. The challenges is that our prices and our incentives and our cultural

31:03.440 --> 31:12.880
aspirations are having them focus on that first hat, where there is not a common plan of action

31:12.880 --> 31:19.360
where all three of those hats can align. And I would imagine that if we had better prices

31:20.000 --> 31:27.760
on non-renewable inputs, if we had a complementary metric to GDP, because I think GDP does

31:28.640 --> 31:34.160
still have some uses, but if there was a well-being metric attached to it for context,

31:34.880 --> 31:42.480
and then suddenly all of your book and all of your seven points would scale massively. But until

31:42.480 --> 31:49.280
that happens, the incentives and the prices that basically we just pay for the cost of extraction,

31:49.280 --> 31:57.360
not the cost of creation or pollution on our main goods, are not going to allow communities and

31:57.360 --> 32:01.520
cities and nations to embrace this writ large. What are your thoughts on that?

32:02.480 --> 32:07.120
So I love those three hats. I think many people are realizing over time that those

32:07.840 --> 32:13.360
second and third hats, I want to be a good parent and I want to be a good citizen of the world,

32:13.360 --> 32:18.960
these are coming much, much closer together. So I have 14-year-old twins. If I imagine what will

32:18.960 --> 32:25.040
the world be like when they are 80 or 90, then I believe there's nothing I can do to protect them

32:26.400 --> 32:31.520
that doesn't actually involve protecting the world because we utterly depend upon a thriving world.

32:31.520 --> 32:37.120
So if you want to be a good parent, you need to care for the whole world and system. As Jeanine

32:37.120 --> 32:42.880
Beniaz always beautifully says, you know, a species and a platter or an animal can't be around for

32:42.880 --> 32:47.120
10,000 generations, so it takes care of the place that will take care of its offspring,

32:47.120 --> 32:54.480
and that's the best we can do. I completely agree that the incentives for the manager of a, well,

32:54.480 --> 33:00.640
Norway's sovereign wealth fund, there's a lot of realigning to do that. But if any major corporate

33:00.640 --> 33:06.480
designed company, the incentives are way off. So just to come directly to your point about prices,

33:06.480 --> 33:11.520
yes, the price incentives are way out. I would fix it not only through changing prices, but

33:12.160 --> 33:15.920
this will also change prices through changing regulations. So I really believe, you know,

33:15.920 --> 33:20.240
I don't think you're advocating, you know, set the right price and the quantity will fix itself.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.320
Like, I really like what Amsterdam are doing. They're just saying, in 2020, they said,

33:24.960 --> 33:30.800
in 10 years time, in 2030, there will be no fossil fuel vehicles in the city, no boats, no cars.

33:30.800 --> 33:35.840
So guys get, you've got a long, loud legal message. It's very clear this is the transformation that's

33:35.840 --> 33:40.480
happening. So nobody changed the price on that day, but they changed all the signals. And of course,

33:40.480 --> 33:44.800
that has knock on effects of changing all the future expected price. So we need to put in

33:44.800 --> 33:49.920
place regulations that just remove life-destroying chemistry and introduce only life-friendly

33:49.920 --> 33:53.840
chemistry that just remove fossil fuels from the system. And so that we put in that long,

33:53.840 --> 33:58.080
loud legal message that the system will start to adapt. But I also want to come back to the

33:58.080 --> 34:03.920
point you say that the managers are not facing the right incentives. We can change the prices

34:03.920 --> 34:11.120
that they face, the incentives around them. We can also change the deep design of the

34:11.120 --> 34:17.040
organizations they work for. And one more piece of puppet show. This to me is a really key one.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.280
And in fact, you know, if I could go back and rewrite a section of joint economics,

34:21.280 --> 34:24.160
this is one thing that I would bring up much more clearly. And it comes from the work of

34:24.160 --> 34:28.560
Marjorie Kelly, who's a next generation enterprise designer working for the Democracy

34:28.560 --> 34:36.640
Collaborative in the US. Marjorie's book that I read, Regenerative Ownership, she, or owning

34:36.640 --> 34:41.360
our future, it's called, she said, you know, you need to look at the deep design of an enterprise.

34:42.000 --> 34:46.800
So here's the five deep design traits, right? What is the purpose of this enterprise?

34:46.800 --> 34:50.720
Why does it even exist? What is it in service of in the world? How is it networked with its

34:50.720 --> 34:55.200
employees, its suppliers, its customers, its industry allies? What relationships does it

34:55.200 --> 34:59.040
hold? Does it see everybody else as a competitor or the allies in transformation? How is it

34:59.040 --> 35:02.400
governed? Who's at the table who has voice and decision making? What are the metrics?

35:03.760 --> 35:09.200
How is it owned by shareholders, by a family for 300 years, by venture capital, by the workers,

35:09.200 --> 35:12.400
by the state, because how its own is going to profoundly shape how it's financed,

35:12.400 --> 35:17.920
where that finance is coming from, and what therefore it's expecting or extracting or demanding?

35:17.920 --> 35:21.520
And so is it, is the governance ownership and finance going to be in line with

35:21.520 --> 35:25.600
maximizing returns to the owners, which is a very 20th century corporate design,

35:25.600 --> 35:29.520
or is it actually going to be in line with serving the purpose, which might be sequestering carbon,

35:29.520 --> 35:33.920
building community, creating health? So to me, if I was looking around that room,

35:35.120 --> 35:41.600
I would say, yeah, you're wearing a hat of the manager of the fund and strapped to your body

35:41.600 --> 35:47.280
is a structural design that is informing what you can and can't do, what doesn't,

35:47.280 --> 35:53.440
doesn't have materiality in your decision making, so in addition to prices. And how can we change

35:53.440 --> 35:57.760
these deep designs of institutions? So at Donatee Economic Section Lab, we're working with companies

35:57.760 --> 36:01.280
that many companies come to us and say, oh, we want to do business in the donut. We say, fine,

36:01.280 --> 36:03.920
we don't want to talk about the design of your products. I'm sure they're very nice. We don't

36:03.920 --> 36:07.440
want to talk about the design of that. We want to talk about the design of your company, because

36:07.440 --> 36:12.720
this is ultimately going to determine whether or not your company can become regenerative

36:12.720 --> 36:16.960
and distributive of the value it creates, sharing that value with all those through the supply chain

36:16.960 --> 36:23.360
rather than maximizing returns to the owners, the shareholders, or not, whether it's stuck in an old

36:23.360 --> 36:27.760
pattern. Because what we find when we talk to companies, I'll give you one example. I was at

36:27.760 --> 36:31.440
a circular economy conference last summer and somebody came up to me and she said, you know,

36:31.440 --> 36:38.400
I, she worked for a major clothing company. She said, I'm head of regenerative clothing,

36:38.400 --> 36:42.560
and I've been asked to, or the sustainability, I've been asked to come up with a line of regenerative

36:42.560 --> 36:47.040
clothing for our company to signal we're part of this revolution. But I'm being told I have to

36:47.040 --> 36:53.200
generate 15% profit returns or profit margins on it from the get go, the standard. There's absolutely

36:53.200 --> 36:57.760
no room for this transformation. She said, it's impossible. I cannot do it. So these companies

36:57.760 --> 37:03.120
want the regenerative label, the regenerative, but they want the bottom line because of the

37:03.120 --> 37:06.880
way they're designed and owned and financed. We need to change that deep design.

37:10.160 --> 37:18.160
So, okay, I'm with you on that, except our entire edifice is supported by the

37:18.880 --> 37:24.960
one-time endowment of the carbon pulse. So I don't know in donut economics and the planetary

37:24.960 --> 37:34.560
boundaries, it seems like we're avoiding exceeding nitrogen, CO2, you know, biodiversity limits,

37:34.560 --> 37:39.760
and that these communities are responding because they, they don't want to exceed those and they're

37:39.760 --> 37:46.160
making like Grenoble and those other places you talked about. How much of it is in response to

37:46.640 --> 37:54.960
not publicly aware yet, but anticipated depletion of these energy helpers that we get annually the

37:54.960 --> 38:01.360
equivalent of 500 billion human laborers worth of energy that we're just pulling from the ground?

38:01.360 --> 38:09.360
Because as a corporation that wants to make regenerative clothing and needs to make 15%

38:09.360 --> 38:14.560
a year, if you get these cheap fossil helpers, that's going to help you meet your bottom line

38:15.040 --> 38:20.880
a lot easier. So how do we manage that? How does that fit into the story here?

38:22.560 --> 38:30.320
Well, as you said, this one of carbon pulse, it's, it's got a pulse away, right? Whether it's

38:30.320 --> 38:36.160
through peak or whether the evident impacts in the world we need to let go of it and that's the

38:36.160 --> 38:42.640
heart of your work, what happens next. I agree that, so going back to the way economics is taught,

38:42.640 --> 38:48.160
we are not taught economics saying, here you are on any course in the early 21st century,

38:48.160 --> 38:52.800
by the way, you're studying economics at the end of a one off massive carbon pulse,

38:52.800 --> 38:59.520
which has created abnormal temporary conditions, one of which the most important of which is

38:59.520 --> 39:06.080
because of the availability of cheap energy, it's given us phenomenal uplift of growth.

39:06.080 --> 39:10.160
And we've come to think that was normal and we, right, we need to be aware that that was

39:10.160 --> 39:16.720
historic and that's not the future. So how do we move away from that? That's why I think it's

39:16.720 --> 39:20.960
important to question growth, but I want to come back and question the design of the company,

39:20.960 --> 39:25.200
because the way these companies are designed, they're designed on the presumption of growth

39:25.200 --> 39:29.760
and therefore the, the, you know, the planet may be, the planet may be going to hand the

39:29.760 --> 39:34.880
handcuff, but I want my 15% and that's still deeply written into the mindset, you know,

39:34.880 --> 39:41.040
this coming out of the financial community, right? I want my high returns that, and that hasn't

39:41.680 --> 39:46.800
modified at all in terms of the reality of what can actually be regenerated on a planet that

39:46.800 --> 39:54.720
isn't depending on the extraordinary free cheap labor of fossil fuel, but actually comes back

39:54.720 --> 40:00.640
within the regenerative capacity of renewable energies. To me, that's the, that, that's your,

40:00.640 --> 40:05.600
that's your question. Are we, are we going to get this before it breaks us? Will we get this and

40:05.600 --> 40:10.400
learn to bend? And for me, part of the bending is bending in the design of institutions. So we

40:10.400 --> 40:15.280
create companies that don't depend upon endless growth. They understand that they may grow until

40:15.280 --> 40:21.600
they're mature in size and scale, but then they can thrive and they're not owned in ways that

40:21.600 --> 40:27.360
continually expect to extract surplus profit because it's not going to come. It needs to be

40:27.360 --> 40:31.760
reinvested in the enterprise, which is invested in regenerating the world.

40:33.200 --> 40:38.080
You first need to understand it before you can do it. So this is very important, I think. One of my

40:38.640 --> 40:44.960
first podcast guests was Danella Meadows, husband, Dennis Meadows, and when asked what are some of

40:44.960 --> 40:53.280
the pathways forward, he's like one of the prerequisites is to extend the time horizons

40:53.280 --> 40:59.360
of institutions from quarterly or yearly to five years or 10 years or 20 years.

40:59.920 --> 41:04.720
So there's something that some friends of mine are working on called the long-term stock exchange,

41:04.720 --> 41:13.280
which is to duly list current companies on this long-term stock exchange, which makes decisions

41:13.280 --> 41:19.600
for all three hats that I mentioned earlier simultaneously, because otherwise we're just

41:19.600 --> 41:27.680
in this short term have to get the 15% now. We can't look at the impact on the planet and

41:27.680 --> 41:33.120
depletion and these other things. So maybe that's one of the pathways.

41:33.120 --> 41:39.200
Yeah. So I'm going to come back here. Whenever I hear an innovation like that, I come back here

41:39.200 --> 41:45.040
and I think, which bit of this deep design of the enterprise or its environment are you there for

41:46.000 --> 41:51.200
adapting? So if you've got the long-term stock exchange, is that going to influence how,

41:51.200 --> 41:55.680
how is that going to influence how the company's governed? Are you putting, for example, you could

41:55.680 --> 42:01.440
have, if it's a shareholder and company, you could have shares, you know, different voting

42:01.440 --> 42:06.080
rights for shares that are held over decades or that you're committed to hold for many decades,

42:06.080 --> 42:11.040
so that you give more voting to the long-term view than to the short-term view. Other companies like

42:11.040 --> 42:16.480
Faith and Nature, a shampoo and beauty company, they recently put, literally one of their 11

42:16.480 --> 42:20.400
directors has become nature. They've put nature on the board because they said, we kept asking,

42:20.400 --> 42:24.320
what would nature do? Well, let's stop asking this as a sort of hypothetical question. Let's

42:24.320 --> 42:30.720
put nature on the board. So nature is represented by an environmental lawyer who says in bringing

42:30.720 --> 42:36.800
naturally a long-term view because nature wants to be the infinite game and thrive forever.

42:36.800 --> 42:42.480
So what would nature vote for us to do on the board? So all sorts of changes that go on between

42:43.280 --> 42:48.320
how the company's owned and governed, bringing in innovations like that, I think this is,

42:48.320 --> 42:53.600
this is really where the future of enterprise design lies and what it depends upon, because if we

42:53.600 --> 43:01.440
don't bring that longer-term and wider thinking in terms of nature's interest, the supply chain's

43:01.440 --> 43:05.760
interest, the workers' interest, rather than it being dominated and owned by the interests of

43:05.760 --> 43:11.200
finance, then we're just stuck in a model that's just in service to finance and not in service to

43:11.200 --> 43:16.480
life. And to me, that's essentially what fascinates me with your work is this ultimate question of

43:16.480 --> 43:22.480
what does it look like to design finance that's in service to life, that actually finance that could

43:22.480 --> 43:26.880
contribute to be and be part of a regenerative system? Because the financial system we've created

43:26.880 --> 43:31.840
is exponential and extractive and it's like the antithesis of a living system.

43:32.080 --> 43:38.320
I fully agree. And the default trajectory is that the superorganism will eat the doughnut

43:39.920 --> 43:48.800
unless things change. So the doughnut is your best known diagram, but you flashed one up earlier,

43:49.360 --> 43:57.600
which I think is equally important, is the embedded economy that replaces the circular flow of goods

43:57.600 --> 44:06.800
diagram. And in there, you had the household and the commons. And could you unpack that a little bit?

44:06.800 --> 44:13.280
I mean, I assume the household, you're talking about the care economy. And could you expand on the

44:13.280 --> 44:18.880
importance of that and why we need to include that in our metrics, et cetera, going forward?

44:19.440 --> 44:25.520
Yeah. So the importance of, so economy and society in the living world, the importance for me of

44:25.520 --> 44:32.800
dividing the economy up was because the very 20th century economic debate and the kind of the

44:32.800 --> 44:39.040
debate between Milton Friedman and or Hayek and Keynes was very much about the relationship and

44:39.040 --> 44:44.000
the roles of the market and the state. And if you focus in, it's fascinating, but if you focus

44:44.000 --> 44:47.840
only on that, you get this very 20th century ideological boxing match, you know, you're a

44:47.840 --> 44:53.040
free market, let's say for a capitalist or your state loving socialist. And in those were the

44:53.040 --> 44:59.120
only two choices. Those are your only two choices, mate. It still goes on today. I mean, I find

44:59.120 --> 45:03.680
extraordinary, particularly in the US, I find if you critique the market, oh, oh, oh, so you're

45:03.680 --> 45:09.200
a communist? Like, is that it? So that's why I like to bring in new framing and not use that

45:09.200 --> 45:14.240
language, just speaking in a different space. So the market and the state, of course, that's

45:14.240 --> 45:20.320
what shows up in GDP. That's the market output of the economy. But the way I think of these four

45:20.320 --> 45:26.160
sectors is they are four different ways, really useful ways, each of them, that we provision for

45:26.160 --> 45:30.960
our needs and wants. So we can provision for our needs and wants through market based exchange,

45:30.960 --> 45:36.320
through price based market. Adam Smith was onto something, right? The market is an amazing mechanism

45:37.120 --> 45:42.320
with a lot of feedback loops through the price signal, sending messages to buyers and sellers

45:42.960 --> 45:48.480
who never need to meet, who through that mechanism provide things that they want to supply and buy.

45:49.200 --> 45:56.160
A couple of caveats, it only serves those who can pay the rest it ignores, and it only values

45:56.160 --> 46:00.160
what's priced the rest it exploits. So big caveats, which is one of the reasons why we

46:00.160 --> 46:04.080
obviously need the state, the state provisions, public services, public goods for all,

46:04.720 --> 46:09.200
whether it's because it's a natural monopoly or because it's a human right. So we need that.

46:09.200 --> 46:12.880
But this still leaves us in the kind of market state dichotomy in marketed goods.

46:13.680 --> 46:20.080
Many other of our needs and wants are produced and provided through care, through unpaid caring work

46:20.080 --> 46:25.760
in the household, where we all begin every day. It's the domain of the cooking, washing, cleaning,

46:25.760 --> 46:30.880
sweeping, raising the kids, teaching them to be good members of society. None of which is included

46:30.880 --> 46:38.480
in GDP. None of which, and yet which makes life work and it makes life worth it. And then the

46:38.480 --> 46:46.400
Commons, which Ellen Ostrom bought from political science into economics and said, well, how people

46:46.400 --> 46:50.960
collaborate not through markets and not through the state, but as a community, they come together

46:50.960 --> 46:56.640
and co-create goods and services that they value collectively. And this can work very, very well.

46:56.640 --> 47:02.480
Garrett Hardin said in the late 60s, oh, the Commons, it's a tragedy. And Ellen Ostrom

47:02.480 --> 47:06.800
come along and says, well, you rift and sort of presume that the Commons is a tragedy. I actually

47:06.800 --> 47:12.800
went and visited some, you know, they actually work really well, rice farmers in Nepal or fishermen

47:12.800 --> 47:18.720
in Maine, and they actually managed to create rules that they follow together, collective

47:18.720 --> 47:24.720
discussions, there are punishments for breaking the rules. There are all sorts of codes in place

47:24.720 --> 47:30.640
that make the Commons work. So I think all economics should begin, you know, in a classroom

47:30.640 --> 47:35.360
with 14 year olds, teach them these ideas and then just say, go out in the street, go out in the

47:35.360 --> 47:40.800
street, just look around you. You'll see the market, you'll see the state, you'll see household care,

47:40.800 --> 47:46.080
you'll see the Commons, you'll realize we're immersed in it all, all of the time. And therefore,

47:46.080 --> 47:51.840
each one of us is a producer and a consumer. We play a role in markets. We're a citizen and a

47:51.840 --> 47:58.880
resident or your parents may be a public servant, they may be a doctor or a teacher or a bureaucrat.

47:58.880 --> 48:03.040
We're all immersed in households. What are you doing in a household and what's the

48:03.040 --> 48:07.520
politics of household care? Who's doing that work? And we're all commoners, we're part of a club,

48:07.520 --> 48:14.080
part of society. And we suddenly see a much fuller economic view of ourselves. And then you can start

48:14.080 --> 48:18.320
talking about power, because there's a power relationship across every one of these lines,

48:18.320 --> 48:22.800
the power between the market and the household. I know in the US, I understand that women have

48:22.800 --> 48:27.680
like how many weeks maternity leave before they have to come back for work? You know,

48:27.680 --> 48:33.760
it's just like weeks, whereas in Denmark, it's parental leave a year between both parents.

48:33.760 --> 48:38.000
Very different negotiations of that market household relationship, but power between the

48:38.000 --> 48:41.920
market and the state. Ronald Reagan famously told us to roll back the state, get out of the way.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.240
Margaret Thatcher did the same. And I think we're seeing a lot of the consequences of this kind

48:46.240 --> 48:52.240
of market fundamentalism, market crushing out the Commons, market society. Often people say we

48:52.240 --> 48:57.120
live in a market society. And then are we now marketizing our relationship with the living

48:57.120 --> 49:01.760
one? That's one of my concerns about bringing a market based economic language of natural

49:01.760 --> 49:07.040
capital accounting or ecosystem valuation to the living world. But there's there's relationships,

49:07.040 --> 49:11.360
power relationships across all of these lines. And last thing I'll say on this diagram, one of

49:11.360 --> 49:15.920
the most interesting things is when you think about economic provisioning that happens across

49:16.640 --> 49:20.800
these, so the state and the Commons, the state commons partnerships, how can the state be a

49:20.800 --> 49:27.200
good partner to the Commons? How can the state support the household with childcare centers,

49:27.200 --> 49:33.120
for example? How can the market and the Commons, you can have platform cooperativism, right? So

49:33.120 --> 49:37.120
you can have a Commons platform and then people can run small market based enterprises on that

49:37.120 --> 49:42.000
Commons. So some of the most interesting economic innovations in our economies are happening at

49:42.000 --> 49:45.600
the intersections of these. And if you don't start by seeing them all of them, you'll miss it.

49:45.600 --> 49:50.160
And you'll miss out that space of innovation. So yeah, this is this is a kind of base map.

49:50.160 --> 49:54.080
If the donor is the compass, the embedded economy diagram is the base map. And it's,

49:54.080 --> 49:58.880
it's a real tribute to Herman Daley, it says, whenever you see a diagram of economy,

49:58.880 --> 50:03.360
you got to draw the living world around it and say, this is a closed system. And this is an

50:03.360 --> 50:08.960
open subsystem, deal with it, create finance and create economic systems that actually

50:09.600 --> 50:11.760
thrive within the dynamics of the living world.

50:14.000 --> 50:19.200
Are you teaching right now, or are you full time with Donut Economics Action Lab and etc?

50:20.000 --> 50:25.280
I do teach a little bit in one course in Oxford, but I threw Donut Economics Action Lab through

50:25.280 --> 50:31.440
teaching in Oxford. So I actually, no, let me, let me rewind that. Two days after Herman Daley died,

50:32.320 --> 50:35.760
I was giving a lecture on a kind of critiques of, you know, mainstream economics and new

50:35.760 --> 50:38.720
economics. And some students rushed up to me afterwards and they just said,

50:39.840 --> 50:43.280
why aren't all first year economic students taught these ideas? And there was this kind of

50:43.280 --> 50:47.360
real frustration. And I just felt it was, it was because Herman Daley had just died and just this

50:48.320 --> 50:52.000
damn, the baton has really been passed to this generation now. So I just thought,

50:52.000 --> 50:55.600
why the heck isn't it not? So I live in Oxford, I haven't to live in Oxford, I moved here 20

50:55.600 --> 50:59.600
years ago to work for Oxfam and here I am. So my local university, Oxford University,

50:59.600 --> 51:04.960
and I, I teach there. And I thought, right, I'm going to put on a course that's open to all students

51:04.960 --> 51:08.240
who come to the city of Oxford, where the Oxford University, Oxford Brooks University,

51:08.240 --> 51:14.080
there are two universities here, to study economics in any kind. And it's free and it's on and it was

51:14.080 --> 51:18.480
at night and it was student organized and it was fantastic. And we had 200 students do the whole

51:18.480 --> 51:24.400
thing throughout eight weeks. Now, the reason I did it here in Oxford was to develop the materials

51:24.400 --> 51:30.800
that I now want to turn into a course that we can share online with everybody. So part, and this

51:30.800 --> 51:36.000
is my work at Donut Economics Action Lab. How do we, you know, the real question of Donut Economics

51:36.000 --> 51:39.440
Action Lab is how can we put these ideas in the comments? I've now put all the ideas of Donut

51:39.440 --> 51:43.680
Economics in the comments and we share them and we've turned them into tools for cities and tools

51:43.680 --> 51:48.960
for communities and tools for business. We ask only as commoners, we ask that people share back

51:48.960 --> 51:53.280
their learning and their innovation, because that's what means we collectively learn. But part of this

51:53.280 --> 52:00.080
is the future that we plan is to provide more training, provide more courses, and provide the

52:00.080 --> 52:03.920
materials for those courses so that other teachers can then say, great slide deck, thank you very

52:03.920 --> 52:07.440
much. And now I'm going to go and teach that so that it spreads and scales. To me, always the

52:07.440 --> 52:12.240
question is, how do we help these ideas spread and scale at the speed that these times demand? And

52:12.240 --> 52:17.520
how do you do that with an openness of sharing, but also an integrity? Making sure the ideas don't

52:17.520 --> 52:22.480
get greenwashed along the way. And so it's continually balancing that openness and integrity.

52:22.480 --> 52:26.880
And that's why we're in Action Lab, actually. It's all about putting ideas into action and it's a lab

52:26.880 --> 52:32.000
because the way we are aiming to do it, we're learning along the way as well how to design these

52:32.000 --> 52:37.680
commons well so that they retain integrity, but that they can spread as fast as possible.

52:37.680 --> 52:41.200
And I invite anybody listening to this to come and check out what we're doing at

52:41.280 --> 52:46.560
DonutEconomics.org. You can see our platform, you can join, you can browse, you can use the tools.

52:47.120 --> 52:51.520
Please be a good commenter if you use the tools, share back because we know that the peer-to-peer

52:51.520 --> 52:57.440
inspiration, when a mayor says, I'm using this tool in our city, that's just massive inspiration and

52:57.440 --> 53:02.720
has, you know, has directly traceable impacts on other mayors and councillors elsewhere who then

53:02.720 --> 53:07.520
get the inspiration, but also somehow get the permission. It's time to move. Let's go. They're

53:07.520 --> 53:12.800
going. Amsterdam's going, Copenhagen, Brussels, Barcelona, Grenoble. It's time to go. Epo in

53:12.800 --> 53:19.040
Malaysia, South Hanna Bay in South Africa. We're on the move. If I had taken your class, if I had

53:19.040 --> 53:24.400
been one of those 200 when I was 18 years old, it would have completely transformed my entire life.

53:26.000 --> 53:31.360
Well, I think if I had taken Reality 101 with you and in many students, it would transform many,

53:31.360 --> 53:35.120
many lives. And I think these are the foundational courses that a lot of students,

53:35.120 --> 53:41.360
again, as I said, born into climate crisis, born into an era of awareness of global North South,

53:41.360 --> 53:45.600
Black Lives Matter and born into a much critical, much more critical awareness of the inequities

53:45.600 --> 53:50.640
thrown up by the systems we've created. They are looking for these tools that will help them

53:50.640 --> 53:54.800
transform the future and at the very least steer through the future that they know crisis is coming

53:54.800 --> 54:00.720
and we need resilience. So yes, let's spread these ideas, you know, through podcast and through

54:00.720 --> 54:05.920
online courses to make them available as possible. I get no greater thrill than when a teacher writes

54:05.920 --> 54:09.840
to me on Twitter and says, I'm using these ideas and I'm teaching them in my class and it's like,

54:09.840 --> 54:16.560
go, let's go. This is big team work. And we create a big team when we share and feedback and that

54:16.560 --> 54:20.080
lovely feeling of, I mean, I'm part of a really big team and I don't even know the names of all

54:20.080 --> 54:24.640
my teammates, but we're doing this together. Well, you're part of the right team. That's even more

54:24.640 --> 54:32.000
important on behalf of nature and the future. If I can help you in any way on that, obviously,

54:32.000 --> 54:36.880
we're doing this podcast, but let's continue talking offline because I think what you're

54:36.880 --> 54:45.600
doing is so important. You just mentioned inequalities. I know that wealth inequality is

54:45.600 --> 54:54.160
something that you often talk about. It seems that income and wealth inequality are incompatible with

54:54.800 --> 55:01.440
what you envision to be a successful doughnut economy. Do you think that ecologically and

55:01.440 --> 55:09.040
biophysically responsible societies need to go hand in hand with more materially equitable

55:09.040 --> 55:16.800
societies? Yes, definitely. I mean, here's the doughnut. Here's the overshooting and shortfall

55:16.800 --> 55:20.160
doughnut. So all the red in the middle is the extent to which people worldwide are falling

55:20.160 --> 55:24.240
short on essential needs and the outside is the extent to which we're overshooting planetary

55:24.240 --> 55:29.600
boundaries. Actually, it's been updated and the 2022 data would show even more red here. We're

55:29.600 --> 55:36.880
overshooting even more. So the scale of inequality in the world is just gobsmacking.

55:37.760 --> 55:42.960
The richest 1% of people own half of the world's wealth. I can't actually, in my head,

55:43.520 --> 55:52.240
hold that as the scale of inequalities that has. There's no way we can meet the needs of all people

55:52.240 --> 55:59.040
within the means of planetary boundaries in such an inequality because we need a massive redistribution

55:59.040 --> 56:05.280
of resources and access to resource for all these people who literally don't have food,

56:05.280 --> 56:11.440
health, education, housing, transport. We need to see the most economic growth and the most

56:11.440 --> 56:15.600
well-being growth in the lowest income countries. That's where I absolutely believe that economies,

56:15.600 --> 56:20.560
if we measure them in traditional way, GDP, they will grow. Malawi people there live on

56:20.560 --> 56:26.160
an average $1,500 per person per year, massive human shortfall. We need to see that growth.

56:27.360 --> 56:32.720
And the only way that that's going to be possible with the planetary limits is for those who have

56:32.720 --> 56:37.440
very large material footprints now, which are very heavily coupled with high incomes,

56:38.320 --> 56:43.280
to come back with influential boundaries. So creating a far more equitable world globally

56:43.280 --> 56:49.280
and also within nations is an essential part of making it even feasible to think about coming

56:49.280 --> 56:53.520
with influential boundaries. So yes, they have to be brought together. And many people I know

56:53.520 --> 56:58.960
when they talk about the concept of a regenerative economy would say, well, a far more equitably

56:58.960 --> 57:06.880
distributed economy is part of that. A regenerative system cannot thrive and continue if it's deeply

57:06.880 --> 57:12.240
unequal. And I would agree. The reason I, in my book, and in these seven principles, I pulled

57:12.240 --> 57:17.920
them out. I said, I want to just distinguish between or highlight that as well as from degenerative

57:17.920 --> 57:24.240
to regenerative, from divisive to distributive, because I came working at Oxfam for a decade.

57:24.240 --> 57:29.280
I came very much from a social justice background. And it's really important that the redistributional

57:29.280 --> 57:35.280
intention or the predistributional intention is very, very clear. And I think sometimes when

57:35.760 --> 57:39.600
some people hear regenerative and they think, oh, that's just environmental or just ecological,

57:39.600 --> 57:44.320
it's really important to say, hang on, we're rebalancing both the ecological imbalances and

57:44.320 --> 57:50.080
the social imbalances, and they have to happen together. So yes, crucial. And then it goes back

57:50.080 --> 57:56.240
to that lovely phrase from George Monbiot, public luxury, it's accessible to all and

57:56.240 --> 58:01.680
private sufficiency. That is very much a redistributional agenda that would achieve that.

58:02.320 --> 58:09.680
I think we evolved with material equality because we didn't have any energy surplus. And now this

58:09.680 --> 58:19.600
energy carbon pulse has created this just series of multiple scale power laws. Let me ask you this.

58:22.560 --> 58:31.040
Do we need to change the prices and the cultural aspirations before such a wealth transfer would

58:31.040 --> 58:39.920
take place? Because if we keep the same GDP as our goal, prices are at the cost of extraction,

58:39.920 --> 58:46.640
not their real value, and we do a simultaneous wealth transfer within countries and between

58:46.640 --> 58:54.560
countries to the global south, wouldn't that in itself actually accelerate some of the exceedings

58:54.560 --> 59:00.800
of the planetary boundaries? So I think instead of thinking in terms of prices, I was thinking in

59:00.800 --> 59:06.960
terms of the actual, that's why I prefer to think in terms of the regulation of saying we are going

59:06.960 --> 59:13.520
to eliminate the use of fossil fuels here, whether it's the car or transforming, insulating our homes

59:13.520 --> 59:20.640
and moving away from fossil fuel to renewable energy, so that we just bring down that intensive

59:20.720 --> 59:26.160
use of fossil fuels and make available the remaining carbon budget to other countries that

59:26.880 --> 59:33.920
have massively underused theirs. So let me ask a follow-up question there.

59:35.920 --> 59:42.640
There's a lot of built infrastructure and momentum and sunk cost in the global north.

59:43.600 --> 59:54.480
Is it possibly more likely that a culture, a community, a region to truly live like

59:54.480 --> 01:00:05.600
donut economics, minimum human needs and don't exceed planetary boundaries in the global south,

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:12.880
in areas that don't have all this infrastructure and sunk cost of expectations and institutions?

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:20.400
Would it be easier to start this in Kenya or somewhere? I'm just asking.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:27.680
Yeah, so, and I think it's a really, really valid question. I think there are two things

01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:32.960
pulling in different directions. There is not the sunk cost, there's not the sunk infrastructural

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:39.600
structure that's been put in place. You haven't got the intensive road-based culture that, say,

01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.680
North America has been locked into. In the same way that they've jumped from, you know,

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:51.440
no phones to mobile phones, from no banking to e-banking, they've jumped all those institutions

01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:56.880
in between. So yes, when there's no infrastructural in place, you can jump to a far better solution

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:03.360
and that must be why there's the global north and the world makes available resources to invest

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:07.440
in renewable energy so they jump into renewable energy solutions. So on the one hand, you've got

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.440
the lack of inherited infrastructure as a barrier. But of course, the other side of is it,

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.720
high income countries have so much wealth and resources and technology and skilled people.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:25.600
So they've got the accumulation of wealth in resources that they can either convert or they

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:30.800
can use that skill and the institutional structures that enable that to happen. So the idea of saying,

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:37.200
you know, oh, this is much easier for Kenya or Malawi, they're on incredibly low incomes and

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:41.120
it would only be easier if we have the transfers that need to happen from the global north to the

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:47.200
global south due to historic responsibilities for climate and other ecological resource use

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.400
that should be happening. I mean, I think of countries in kind of three clusters

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.480
heading towards the donut, there are the low income countries that like the ones we've just

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.320
been mentioning that need to meet the needs of all people for the first time without overshooting

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.000
planetary boundaries in the way that countries before them have done. And that's never been done

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:10.240
before. There's the middle income nations like China and Iran and Mexico and Russia that need to

01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.080
meet people's needs for the first time while already coming back within planetary boundaries.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:18.560
That's never been done before either. And then there's the high income nations that are in massive,

01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:22.960
all high income nations are overshooting planetary boundaries. If I showed you their

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:29.040
national donuts, they're like big red overshoot. So first of all, next time you catch or I catch

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.200
anybody here or find ourselves saying developed countries, advanced nations like, hang on,

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:38.320
what are you talking about? Because there's absolutely nothing advanced or developed about

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.480
overshooting planetary boundaries. So we should be reframing our language. But these nations need to

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.960
reduce and come back within planetary boundaries, not just on carbon, big one,

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:53.280
but also on water use, land use, material use, all of those planetary boundaries calming back

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.800
within while finally meeting people's needs for the first time, which they definitely have the

01:02:56.800 --> 01:03:02.160
resources to do. And that is an unprecedented pathway too. So every nation is on a pathway of

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:07.120
transformation. None of it's been done before. Some have the advantage of wealth. Some have

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:12.080
the advantage of not being locked in to existing infrastructure and some I think many of the emerging

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:17.520
economies, they're in the middle of those big infrastructural investments. And this is the

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:22.320
critical time to get it right. And of course, I think one of the dangers is the fossil fuel industry

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.280
when they find themselves being closed in the global north, the real risk is that they then

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:32.560
go and sell their wares to the lower income countries to get them locked in. And how do we

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:38.080
avoid them getting that lock in instead moving to the renewable energy future that will actually

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:42.000
power them and enable them not to get locked into endless growth. They need to grow now,

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.360
but not get locked into institutions that drive them to endlessly.

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:53.600
So what is the correct term developed world that's creating global ecocide or the global north? I mean,

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:56.240
what is the acceptable term? Do you come up with something?

01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.880
Yeah, I use just very factual language of high income, middle income and low income,

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:06.560
because I'm just describing their income levels. But I think we really need new language because

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.760
the more that we find ourselves saying, you know, even if people say, well, developed nations,

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:14.640
but you know what I mean by that, it still just keeps creating this idea that that's the aspiration

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:20.320
and others should get there. And I find it very powerful when I show national donut diagrams

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.520
to countries like Norway, you mentioned Norway, but people are whole Norway up in Norway, wonderful

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.360
life, high income, great quality of air, and you can swim in the harbor, what's not to like.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.520
Norway has a massive ecological overshoot like all high income nations. And when you show them,

01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.800
these images, and that high income countries are very far from living the donut Costa Rica is much

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.200
closer than any other nation. There's a real jaw drop moment, actually. And I've seen it visibly

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:49.840
on the face of officials of nations who who used to being considered the top of the ranking. And

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.880
actually, it really repositions. And there's a humility that kicks in that there's that uh-huh,

01:04:54.880 --> 01:05:01.600
or maybe it's an oh dear, or gosh, look at us moment, that we need of humility and ambition of we too

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:08.560
need to deeply transform. And last century's economic theories were not designed to solve this.

01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:13.360
So we really shouldn't be expecting them to deliver on this. We need new theories, new textbooks,

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:19.360
new courses, new ideas, new policies to get us there. I just saw a graph this morning, which is

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:26.000
another sort of aha that Norway is probably the most successful nation in the world on scaling

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:34.560
electric vehicles. But their oil use is going up. So the addition of electric vehicles replacing

01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:39.280
internal combustion vehicles has not reduced their their oil consumption.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.200
Is it the domestic oil consumption? Because I know they're massive oil

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.720
producer and selling oil to others, but even domestic oil consumption?

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.920
The domestic consumption. Yeah, I'll send you the chart. So here's a question, Kate.

01:05:52.320 --> 01:06:03.440
Um, and this gets to the competition versus cooperation, uh, game theory dynamics of the

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:15.440
world. But if a country or a city or a region chose to let let's we're going to live in the

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:25.680
donut, we're going to follow this from an energy surplus, power, money, potential,

01:06:27.120 --> 01:06:32.960
optionality on doing things in the world, they will be temporarily at least outcompeted

01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:38.080
by those nations that continue to maximize profits because those profits can be spent

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:48.400
on things that either militarily or technologically will cause that that first few nations or

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.600
communities to be outcompeted, not in the long run, because in the long run, it's a tortoise and

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.160
hare sort of thing. And the tortoise we know ends up winning the race. But in the short run,

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:08.400
they'll be outcompeted. Isn't that an inherent like, uh, blockage to wide scale, um, adherence of

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.920
of these ideas? What do you think about that? Yeah, really important point. So let me start

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:18.560
at the level of the city. When cities actually start aiming to do this, I think they actually,

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:22.720
they might not have, you know, grow, grow, grow the city. And many city policymakers say,

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:27.200
that's not our goal. That's not what we judge a success for our city to get bigger,

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.720
to bring in more and more big companies to expand, have more and more housing.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:37.360
People are creating cities that are great places to live where you can move quickly, where the

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.120
air is clean, where there are good schools for kids, where there's nature,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.440
where you feel you won't be hit by a heat wave in the summer. These, these are all qualities of

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.560
living in the doughnut, where there's a strong community, there's public luxury. This brings

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.520
people in. I mean, these city connoble is an example. People are moving to connoble. It's

01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:03.440
seen as a, actually that's a really desirable place to live. So the city scale, I think actually

01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:09.600
it's a signal, especially for industries where people can work remotely and, and parents as

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:13.280
they can have their parental hat and their work hat. And I can actually be around for my kids and

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:19.120
I can reconnect and I want to raise kids here. It brings crowds of people in. Now when you go to

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:25.440
the national level. We need those bold, those bold civic leaders to go in this direction

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:32.240
to then act as pilots of success living this way. Yes. Yes. And I think that, and I'm not

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:39.040
surprised that it's cities starting. Cities are more sites of experiment and courage to, to start

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:44.080
moving. And I think nations are going, I'm hoping and I'm expecting nations are starting to look

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:48.960
at what's happening in cities and saying, actually, this is, this is the seeds of proof of concept and

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.840
can we start doing this national? But this point you just raised, I think is a really big one.

01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.080
And I, when we, when we say, okay, we need to move away from growth dependency, the question becomes

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.600
how our economy is currently structurally dependent upon endless growth. And there are

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.520
at least eight ways, right? There's four financial ways companies pursue maximum returns for their

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:16.080
shareholders, that drives growth, commercial banks create money as interest bearing debt,

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.200
that drives growth. When, if the economy is not growing, but companies are still chasing labor

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.800
productivity, that creates unemployment. So you need growth to absorb the unemployment.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:31.360
On the other side, social lock ins, right, people still after 100 years of propaganda,

01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:38.080
thank you very much, Edward Bernays for succeeding, right? Convincing us that the way we will improve

01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:41.040
ourselves is to buy something more. So there's that kind of consumerism.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:50.000
Having a growing economy helps avoid the ultimate redistribution question. And so it avoids actually

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.880
having to tackle redistribution. But one of them really important social lock into growth, and it's

01:09:54.880 --> 01:10:00.160
kind of geopolitical lock into growth, as you just mentioned, I look at the G20 photo that's

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.640
taken every year. And I think well, no leader wants their country to lose their place in that G20

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:09.520
family photo. But if one of those nations amongst them said, we're no longer going to pursue growth,

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:13.680
we're going to pursue a resilient national economy, well, there is, particularly in the

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:18.480
current atmosphere in the world, there is the geopolitical view, political military question

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:25.840
of geopolitical power and military power, and resilience against threats. And I think

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:33.040
Europe, I mean, the European countries coming together and creating a region is one very good

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:38.720
example of how countries, individual countries can overcome that by saying, well, we together,

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.720
we are stronger, we stand so that we don't individually all have to keep growing, we keep

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:49.600
no the size of us together. But I but to me, this is one of the very most challenging lock ins to

01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:54.160
to structural dependency on growth. And I don't think the solution is an economic question. I

01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:58.160
think it's a political international relations question. And just as much as I would love

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:04.400
these ideas to be taught in economics departments, I think every student studying macro economics

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.960
should absolutely be encountering a macro economics course in post growth thinking.

01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.720
I think all schools of government should be introducing their students to questions of

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:20.960
how can we create, think about geopolitical power and power dynamics and relations and

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:25.520
international relations in a post growth context, because you've just pointed out one of the most

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:31.200
critical collective action problems we have. Why are schools of government not grappling

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:35.280
with this head on? I think they're too much influenced by schools of economics that again,

01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.680
thanks to that one time power pulse from fossil fuels, assume that growth is the norm. And so we

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:44.320
do international relations in the context of assuming growth is the norm for all nations. I

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:51.040
think it's time to move on. I think I on one of our one on one calls, I think I told you this story,

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:57.360
but in the last 10 or 15 years when I'm talking to high level government people around the world,

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:07.520
almost all of them were either themselves or directly flanked by a PhD in economics or finance,

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:15.200
like everyone. And it's like they're the gatekeeper to the politician. So it makes these things

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:21.600
hard. And there's like a glass ceiling of what can be discussed at those levels.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:30.800
Except you were highlighted last month at a beyond growth conference, which the head of the EU

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:37.520
Commission president started out. That must have been a proud moment for you to highlight such an

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:44.960
amazing thing at the European Commission. Yes. Yes. So the group of MEPs in Europe organized

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:50.880
the beyond growth conference in the European Parliament. And it was opened by a Sivanda

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.960
Lyon and she it was it was impressive to see her there. I say it was really important to see her

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:02.400
there. And to see her saying, I think she said, you know, fossil fuel based growth is in the past.

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:06.640
And it's got yeah, she didn't say just growth. No, she said fossil fuel based growth. Yeah.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.480
It's still a win. Yeah. But the fact that she came to a conference and stood on a platform where

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:18.000
it said very large letters behind a beyond growth, that's that's very different from 10 years ago.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.800
And it was really important that that conference happened. And many excellent post growth thinkers

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:30.640
across Europe, D growth, post growth, donate economics, well being economies were there and

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:36.160
talking about what does it mean and indeed not just Europe from around the world, really starting

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.840
to dig into what does it mean in terms of the metrics in terms of the macroeconomic policies

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:44.640
in terms of the labor transition in terms of business design, showing that there is a whole

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:50.000
other form of economic thinking emerging and ready to be taken far more seriously. So I think

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:55.760
it was very, very important that that happened in the European Parliament. And again, I was delighted

01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:00.400
to be presenting the ideas of donate economics there and talking about using these metrics because

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:07.360
I could point to so many pretty major cities in Europe, Brussels, the city capital region of

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:18.320
Brussels itself, Barcelona, where am I trying to say Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Tommelila in Sweden,

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:24.560
and more and more, Bad Nauheim in Germany, some pretty big European cities are saying, yeah,

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:31.760
this we are choosing this the donut framework as our own new metric. So again, it's from the city

01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:37.120
and regional level that it I know it brings it currency and credibility and recognition

01:14:37.120 --> 01:14:39.920
within European Commission. And actually, there's been within the European Commission,

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:45.280
there's a group of civil servants within there who for the last at least three years from just

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:52.800
before COVID, they created a group called Donut for EU. And they within different European Commission

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:57.440
and European Union institutions started saying we want to bring this language. And for me, it's a win.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.960
I don't you know, you don't need to see the diagram of the donut, you don't need to hear the word

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:07.600
donut whenever I hear a policymaker saying, we are aiming for well being or living well within

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:12.320
planetary boundaries or limits or within the means of the planet. To me, the word within

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.440
is a radical word, because you again, you're hearing it the economy within

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.360
the biosphere. So every time I hear a policymaker speak to a vision of well being within

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.760
the planet, you think, hallelujah, we are into a new paradigm with that one little word,

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:37.680
we're in a new space. So one of my addictions is unfortunately buying URLs that I might someday

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:45.440
use. And one of them I bought 10 years ago was livewithin.org. I keep renewing it. I haven't had

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:50.640
time. Speaking of time, how the hell do you manage all this? You were like the degrowth

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:57.120
energizer bunny. I mean, do you have, do you come up with all these graphical tools yourself?

01:15:57.120 --> 01:16:02.560
Or do you have like a professional PR toolmaker? Or are these your ideas?

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.440
Are you saying did I pay somebody to make these bits of cardboard for me?

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:11.120
Well, no, I meant the ideas. Like I want a graphical tool.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:18.080
So, okay, so when donut economics came out, the thrilling thing for me was the number of people,

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:21.680
as I said, who came up and said, love the ideas, and I want to do this. I'm a town counselor,

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:28.080
I'm a teacher, I'm a startup founder, I'm a community organizer. So that's why I set up

01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:34.640
together with a team, donut economics action lab. We are a remote team. There are 12 of us

01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:40.800
working across different countries. And together we are creating these tools. So

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:46.400
we knew right from the beginning that cities would say, what would it mean to do the donut city?

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.400
So we created a tool, came up with a kind of conceptual framework that we make as a canvas,

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:54.560
meaning it's something you can put on the table. You can literally, you know, put things on it,

01:16:54.560 --> 01:17:03.360
make it very visual, very tactile, very unknown, no equations in sight. We don't need equations for

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:09.280
this. It's a worldview reframing activity. And we do it in person. And you can do it online. So

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:12.960
everything we do, because we're a remote organization, it really helps us think remotely. And we

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.960
make all of our tools available on Miro and online, so that we can run web, for example,

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:20.880
the government of Bhutan got in touch. And they said, you know what, the concept of gross

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.200
national happiness, which guides us, it's actually got a lot in common with the donut. We want to

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:30.160
see what happens when we work together with the two concepts. And we ran some webinars for 100

01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:36.960
civil servants of Bhutan online to share these tools with them. So I'm working with a team of

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:41.760
12 people. And I have to say one of the best things for me going from working alone when my book came

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.760
out. And all, you know, the interest that was coming, it was almost bouncing off me because

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.400
there was nothing I personally could do with it. But now there's a team. I say, you're a mayor and

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.440
you don't want to talk about cities. Let me introduce you to my colleague, Leonora. She's

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:57.200
our city's lead. You want to talk about business? You want to talk to Eric Sahan. You want to talk

01:17:57.200 --> 01:18:02.320
about communities? Meet Rob. Talk about education. Meet Carolina. We've got this wonderful team of

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:06.880
people who are running with each of these and bringing practitioners together in a community

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.720
and conversation of peer learning groups. So it's a thrill for me in setting up an organization and

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:18.960
a team with my co-founder Carlotta Sand setting up this team to say, how can we make this work

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:23.200
distributive? Just like this ball, right? At the beginning, it was all coming at me. And this is

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:28.080
just like, I can't cope with all this. But let's distribute it across our team, but also across

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:34.560
the community. Of course, I'm working too hard and running too much, like many, many people and

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:41.600
personally, you think this is at risk of running me down and the times are urgent and the crisis

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:47.520
is now. And because of the crises that are hitting in the world, more and more people are suddenly

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.920
waking up and looking around for those ideas that are lying around. So how do we make sure that

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:58.240
they're really visible, really accessible? And yes, these are very serious issues, but how can we

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:02.240
make them irresistible? Because the last thing you want is people to say, you know what, this is

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:07.120
too complex, too overwhelming. I find it depressing and overwhelming. I'm just going to switch off

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:13.120
from it. I want people to say, that looks energizing, inspiring. I want to be part of it.

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:17.680
And then to lean in. And that's why I aim to make it playful. Well, actually, I just also like having

01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.840
fun. Hell, let's have fun while we're on this team, right? It's got to be the most fun place to work.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:27.280
It's got to be the funnest project to do, rather than just extracting from the world. Let's repair

01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.040
the world and have fun while we do it. So it's the team at Donut Economics Action App and the

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:36.800
community of over 10,000 people who've joined our website and our platform. And it's just, I get

01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.360
energy from every time somebody comes and says, oh, yeah, I'm using this in my town. I'm teaching

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.400
this in my classroom. I've used this in my class. It's just amazingly energizing because we can see

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:51.360
all the challenges in the world. And yet time and time again, you see people, the opposite is

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:56.080
happening. And it's not publicly visible all the time, but it's rising, it's bubbling, it's rising.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.920
And I'm just going to lean all my energy I have into helping keep that rising.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:07.280
Well, congratulations. With just 12 people, you are punching way above your weight on the impact

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:16.960
of sharing these stories with other people. By the way, last week I was traveling and I saw signs

01:20:16.960 --> 01:20:22.560
there is already a national doughnut day, which in the United States people actually just eat

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:27.680
doughnuts. So I'm very happy there will be an international doughnut day with our planetary

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:35.440
boundaries. One final question before I get to the closing questions. So you were at this

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:40.960
Beyond Growth Conference. You and I have talked about this before. I often state that degrowth

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:47.840
is what we should do because of global inequality and because of resource and climate limits.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:55.200
But the metabolism of the system won't allow that. So we will hit a wall and then

01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:01.360
bend, hopefully not break. So degrowth is what we should do, but post growth is what we're going

01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:08.800
to have to do. So the way I see it is there's two tasks here. One is to describe and flesh out

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:14.880
and advocate for what a sustainable, desirable society might look like with the governance and

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.320
the commons and the care economy and everything you've stated. And then how do we get from here

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:26.560
to there, which is a related but distinctly separate question. Do you have any thoughts on

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:35.440
that dichotomy? So definitely spelling out the vision of where we want to get to. And I really

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:38.400
appreciated that you said that earlier on. I said, you know, it's easier said than done. You said,

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:44.320
yeah, but it's really important to say it so we have a vision of it. And that is where I've placed

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:50.160
my energy. And, you know, again, in this big teamwork, that's the role I focused on playing of

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:56.560
how can the donor acts as a vision of where we want to get to. And it's an aspirational positive

01:21:56.560 --> 01:22:01.920
vision. And then setting out some of the fundamental diagrams and the principles that would be part of

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.960
an economy that's got there. And then there's a question of, okay, if we do keep going, if we fail

01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:13.360
to turn and keep accelerating at the wall, will we bend or break? I would say that I think the

01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:18.640
degrowth community, as I understand it, they would say, when you say, can we bend, not break?

01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:23.920
I mean, they would say, degrowth is the aim to bend. That's what people in the degrowth community

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:30.000
mean by a just reduction of consumption and production of less necessary things to come back

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.560
within planetary boundaries in a democratic way. That that is a beautiful vision of a bend.

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:40.080
But I hear you're saying, well, if we don't bend in time, then we're going to hit

01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:45.760
crises. And it's going to be through shocks and through subsystems collapsing, that we're going

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:52.400
to be forced into a post growth future. Just one reflection I'll have on that. And I'm not saying

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:58.640
having set out how to get there. I do think we need a positive vision of what we're still aiming

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:03.920
for. I think really key to that is looking at going back to one of the structural dependencies

01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:09.760
on growth and how do we remove them? Doing that work now gives us the best chance

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:15.040
to survive an era in which growth doesn't come. And that's why I think it's really an ethical

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:20.240
obligation on economists to look at this, you know, the radical uncertainty of the future

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:27.360
and the existential challenges of what happens if the growth based thinking gets it wrong,

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:30.720
I think puts a huge ethical obligation on looking at alternative futures.

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:37.120
But if I come back and think, well, what if we find out that we're going to, you know, if we

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:43.680
break, we don't bend well, we will find we're actually spending much of the century continually

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:48.800
outside of planetary boundaries and people falling short. And the more that we stay out here,

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.760
the more that these crises are going to hit, the more the shocks are going to hit us.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.960
And the first time I asked myself, okay, what if it turns out that

01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:01.440
much of the 21st century is going to be lived outside of these boundaries and continue to be so,

01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:07.760
does that change the goal? I still, it didn't make me move away fundamentally from saying that the

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:14.560
goal is still to come back to the donor. The goal still to be as resilient as we can is to

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.320
create systems that provision essentially for people's needs and do everything we can to combat,

01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.400
you know, every inch here matters. Every inch matters the closer we come to coming back within

01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:33.760
those boundaries. So it didn't dislodge for me the value of this way of thinking. And I would

01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:38.320
love it to be dislodged. And I can I just add a comment here, which is the donut may have come

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:44.080
after, you know, kind of our common future, the Brentland Commission and that definition of

01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:48.720
sustainability. And then we get footprints in the long comes the donut. And I'm very aware it

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.480
stands in a line of thinking. And, and whenever I teach it, I always say to students, and then what

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:59.680
next? This is a, it's not a fight. It's not an endpoint. It's a, it's a point a long away. Our

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.760
thinking is evolving. More people are coming saying, I want to create something more biocentric,

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:09.440
more nature centered. What would that look like? So I look forward also to the day that the donut

01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.840
framework has been superseded, because we've moved beyond it, because there's a generation

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:18.560
rising who instead of seeing the donut, wow, I've been waiting my whole life to see that,

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:22.880
like a 50 year old might say that, yes, I've always thought like this, 20 year old, you show them

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:28.240
the donut and they go, yeah, yeah, I get it. Come on. And go further. They're born into that

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:32.640
expectation. It's quite thrilling to see that. What are they going to create? What's coming next?

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:39.760
Well, you've, you've done such important work on the Overton window of just thinking about

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:45.760
how a new economy might be. I almost think that, and we've talked about this before, that

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.000
I'm trying to work on something called advanced policy, which is those things we're going to

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.720
need to do in the future that are politically and socially too strange and forward to be

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:05.920
accepted today. But if there was like a donut break glass in case of emergency blueprint that

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:14.560
all governments, you know, city, county, national had like a rule of principles and then what to do

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.800
once we're in this situation, but based on some of the core seven things that you laid out,

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:26.800
I think that might be kind of interesting. I like that. Yeah, yeah. Because I think at the,

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:31.120
first rule is please break the glass now and use the donut now. Don't leave it.

01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.880
Don't leave it sitting in the cabinet until the crisis hits, right?

01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:40.720
Well, at its core, and you mentioned Eleanor Ostrom a couple times, at its core, I think we

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:49.040
face a crisis of governance because our governments were not created or the institutions for this

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:55.440
sort of a world and we're just stuck in our ways looking at old forms of governance and

01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:04.000
institutional thinking. So I mean, I think education is the first central point and this is great.

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:12.400
So I have some closing questions, Kate, that I ask all my guests if you have a few more minutes.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:20.000
So more broadly beyond your books, your teaching and the Donut Economics Action Lab,

01:27:20.560 --> 01:27:26.080
you've thought about since the 90s when you had your aha moment and you left the dark side as it

01:27:26.080 --> 01:27:32.800
were these issues as a career choice. Do you have any advice just to the listeners or watchers of

01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:45.920
this program at this time of global poly crisis? If you are embedded in a worldview that sees growth

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:55.600
as the goal, really deeply ask yourself a question that and move to, okay, my biggest piece of advice

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:02.880
is to tap into what we deeply know in our own bodies, right? In our own bodies, we know that health

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:08.080
doesn't lie in growth. I mean, when kids are small, yeah, that's a great sign of health. And then

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:13.840
there comes a point where you don't want them to grow anymore. It comes to thriving and health lies

01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.200
in balance in our bodies. We really get that I need enough food and not too much. I need enough

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:26.400
temperature and warmth and not too much. I need enough water, oxygen, stress on my body, enough

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:32.240
and not too much salt, whatever you want to add, that my bodily health lies in balance. And if

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:38.160
something inside my body tries to grow unstoppably, we call that cancer and we move in and we stop it

01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.040
as soon as we can. We deeply understand that and each one of our own bodies is a complex adaptive

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:52.480
system. So each one of us is a miniature living ecosystem planetary experiment. If we can take

01:28:52.480 --> 01:28:59.280
therefore what we deeply know, not just metaphorically, but really deeply from the human body to the

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.320
planetary body and say what makes sense for human health, makes sense for planetary health,

01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:11.200
and how then do I live when I tap into that thinking? And how do I eat and travel and

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:17.840
invest and divest and protest and volunteer? And how do I protect the health of my body

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.000
as part of the health of the whole planet back to how does the parent look off their child

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:26.400
by looking off the world? It's deeply interconnected. That I think when we tap into that we give

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:30.960
ourselves the best metaphorical opportunity to understand the much greater living system of

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:42.080
which we are part. Sobriety and lagom. Yes. So how would you change that advice to a young

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:48.480
human 17, 18, 19 year olds who are sitting in your Oxford class? Do you change your recommendations

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:53.920
for a young person? Well, so these these many of these young people, as I said, they grew up

01:29:53.920 --> 01:30:00.640
climate striking. Their teenage years were spent marching for a stable climate. They've come from

01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:08.160
a very different place. And I would say to them have the courage of your age. And I mean your youth.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:13.280
You know, I've been in places where a young person came up to me after a talk and she said,

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:18.160
I really wanted to ask a question, but I'm only 17. And I said, wait, you should have put up your

01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:24.800
hand and say, I am 17. And this is my question because actually your youth is part of your

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:29.840
power and your saliency in this room and your presence and your long term view to which we all

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:36.720
owe you a long term answer. So hold on to that clarity of the demands of youth and carry it

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:42.640
through into the classroom and question why you're being taught models that smell deeply dated to you.

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:47.840
Because the biggest change that I've seen coming through, like we're saying in academic economics,

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:54.880
was when the students demanded it's coming from below, it's coming up and believe that systems

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:58.800
get transformed, you know, find out about the history of the civil rights movement and

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:03.440
Gandhi and the decolonization movement and the suffragettes and the women's rights movements

01:31:03.440 --> 01:31:08.160
and always remember that it's been the rebels and the disruptors who were so deeply inconvenient at

01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:14.480
the time and often maligned. They are now celebrated on the classroom walls as the heroes of the age.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:23.360
And so those who protest and disrupt and disturb the system, you are doing key work of transforming

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:28.720
this. And I would say those young people get involved because we know, you know, psychologists

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:34.320
tell us and people feel, if the people feel an anxiety or a stress of the context, it's when

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.000
you get involved and you start actually channeling your energy into being part of it and working with

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:42.960
others and collaborating with others who think like you, that you feel energized and empowered

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:48.560
in this situation rather than depressed and overwhelmed in the same situation. The situation

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:52.800
around us is the same. How do we change it by changing how we engage with it?

01:31:54.160 --> 01:32:00.720
Well, I feel energized and inspired whenever you and I talk. So I agree with you that finding

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:06.800
like-minded people that share your ideals and visions of the future is one of the biggest

01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:10.800
pieces of advice I give to young people. And there's a 17-year-old in all of us, isn't there?

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:21.920
For sure. But I can't imagine being 17 today. I was just a complete child when I was 17 relative

01:32:21.920 --> 01:32:28.720
to the 17-year-olds that were my students learning about ecology and complex adaptive systems.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.360
You know, the world is caught up to this story, Kate.

01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:41.120
Can I just say then, when COVID lockdown happened, my kids were 11, my teenagers, and

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:46.560
we had to homeschool them. So I was like, oh, homeschooling. I thought, well, I know what I'm

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:50.080
going to homeschool them first. I'm going to teach them system thinking. Because I had once

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:55.520
argued, I'd presented the seven ways to think like a 21st century economist with a very mainstream

01:32:55.520 --> 01:33:01.120
professor, economics professor in the Netherlands. And he said, system thinking is far too difficult

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:05.840
for undergraduates to understand. So I thought, OK, let's take this on. So I taught it to my

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:10.480
11-year-olds. We sat down with a big white board. I drew some, here's a reinforcing feedback. Here's

01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:15.120
a balancing feedback. And we drew some basic feedback loops about COVID. And then I just

01:33:15.120 --> 01:33:21.200
handed over the pens and they went wild with it. And they drew from people playing the guitar in

01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:25.200
the back garden to pressure on nurses, to pressure and accountability of the government.

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.440
And they just brought everything in. But my daughter, she was jumping up and down with

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:34.800
excitement. She's like, now I can express what I want to say. You know, born systems thinkers,

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:40.080
now we've given you the tools and language. You can, because you could see these feedback loops

01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:48.800
in the world. So it's also an incredibly exciting time to be educated if you're equipped with some

01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:53.760
of the ideas that are going to actually help us go forward. That's why I just, I find it exciting.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.440
Hand over these tools to young people. Now, what are they going to see? What are they going to do?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:04.720
What will they envision that we can't see? Because we're, you know, I'm 52. There are so

01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:09.040
many possibilities that I just can't see. So I love that feeling of the generational handover

01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:15.120
as well. Let's see what the next generation do with this. I think we, as a culture, massively

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:21.840
underestimate teenagers. And I really loved teaching 18 and 19 year olds, Reality 101.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:28.160
But I actually think it has to start earlier, 12, 13, 14, 15 on these things. Because this is a

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:35.120
huge resource. That's just being taught outdated trivia relative to what the world's going to need.

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:42.000
So what do you care, a personal question, what do you care most about in the world, Kate?

01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:49.040
So I am deeply inspired by Janine Benius, the bio-memory thinker. She's one of my heroes. And

01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:58.160
it's, you hear Janine talk about life, life's capacity to create conditions conducive to life.

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:06.400
That fills me with awe. I'm not a religious person, but if I'm filled with awe of a miracle,

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:16.080
of a marvel, it is the regenerative capacities of life on this planet. And the systems that

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:23.280
keep reproducing conditions conducive to life. That is what I care about most as a living being

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:27.840
on this planet. And that's why I care about economics, the art of household management,

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:35.200
being in service to planetary household and creating an economy that is in service to

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:37.840
continuing to produce conditions conducive to life.

01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:43.840
Other than when we first said hello, the biggest moment of joy in the last three hours for me was

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:50.320
I saw a red fox across the road from me on my bike ride this morning. And yeah, the planet is

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:56.640
an amazing thing. Even in its depleted state on the biosphere relative to a century ago,

01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:03.040
it is still a wonderful, amazing place, the only place in the known universe to harbor life,

01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:11.840
let alone complex life. So last couple of questions, what specific issue are you most

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.800
concerned about in the coming 10 years or so in the world?

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:25.520
I'm going to say, well, two things. One, we know more crises are coming. We know more ecological

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:31.840
impacts. We know more food price crisis will come when for harvests fail, when there are floods.

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:37.760
One of my big concerns is how, coming back to the point of governance, how will we govern

01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:43.440
ourselves in those moments? How will we respond? Will we revert to ration economic man and hoard,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:50.720
and will powers extract as much as they can? This is a great moment to make your 15% folks.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:56.640
Will we respond like that? Or will we move towards Eleanor Ostrom's description of the

01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.800
Commons where we actually recognize that if any of us are going to get through it, because we're

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.120
all going to aim to get through it, and we're going to collaborate. So to me, it's that concern of

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:11.520
what is the groundwork that we put in now so that as those crises hit nations, will they shut

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:14.720
their borders or will they collaborate? What happens over COVID vaccine? What happens during

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:19.680
food price crisis? How do nations respond to one another? That's the concern. And then the really

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:26.320
bigger, longer-term question of a deeper understanding. Well, for me, it's finance. I

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:31.520
really, I still haven't done it. So I want more conversations with you. How do we take finance

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:38.080
that was designed to endlessly accumulate? That's what financial capital has got into its

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:43.680
current DNA. How do you repurpose that utterly human-created design? It's a human construct.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:52.400
How do we redesign that? So it's compatible with life on a planet that aims to continually

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:57.760
produce conditions conducive to life. That's my, so it's not my, that's not my worry. That's

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.080
my big curiosity. That's the, that's the next step of this that I want to much more deeply

01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:07.600
understand. Because until we redesign finance, not just tweak it, not just tweak it, but really

01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:13.920
redesign finance, we are not going to be creating systems, economic systems that actually belong

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:23.360
on this planet. I agree. And I have ideas to be continued on that. So if you could wave a magic

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.400
wand and there was no personal recourse to your decision, what is one thing you would do to

01:38:28.400 --> 01:38:41.040
improve human and planetary futures? Magic wand. I would wave a wand that would help every person

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:50.640
on the, I mean, every person on the planet would realize, feel, recognize that we human beings

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:59.920
are an utterly interdependent and dependent part of the web of life. If we got that, if we really

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:10.240
got that and understood our dependence upon the whole earth's living systems, that to me is the

01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.560
deepest change that would then follow through. I mean, of course, you're going to run into the

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:19.920
design or institutions and that, but if we all deeply got that, and the next generation rising

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:28.000
has that, to me, that's the best, the best implant that we can put into our hearts and minds

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:35.120
that would help us redesign systems so that we actually belong again on planet earth, that one.

01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:40.480
You're not the first person to suggest that we need a change in consciousness with a large amount

01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:47.600
of people in order to get to these change in aspirations and, and the doughnut. And it is

01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:54.800
happening, I think. It's happening slowly. But I'm amazed versus two years ago how many people

01:39:54.800 --> 01:40:04.560
are expressing these ideas, perhaps in no small part to your work. Awesome. So this was our first

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:11.120
public conversation. I know your work. If you were to come back in the future for round two,

01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:18.160
is there one particular topic that you are passionate about that's relevant to our futures

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:24.560
that you would like to take a deep dive on? Any ideas? It's going to be finance. I'm going to

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:34.080
be asking questions. Deep dive into, okay, how does this even begin to look? What is the structural

01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:40.960
design of finance? I mean, I always ask, well, I often say, isn't it weird that a squirrel gathers

01:40:40.960 --> 01:40:44.720
nuts in the autumn and buries them? When the squirrel comes back in January, it doesn't expect to find

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:50.960
15% more nuts, right? So why do we expect to put money into something and expect to come back and

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:57.600
get you 15%? So how could we redesign finance? What are the lock-ins to the current financial

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:02.160
system we have? Is it possible for a new financial system to emerge alongside the existing one?

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:06.320
What would have to change in people's own aspirations and sobriety and largom

01:41:06.320 --> 01:41:11.920
to put their finance in something? What would be the offer? All of that.

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:18.800
I have started a new thing you might not know of, but once a month we have a reality round table

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:25.600
with three or four former guests on a topic. Maybe to have you and Steve Keane and Josh Farley

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:31.680
or John Erickson to talk about this question would be really good. That'd be great. I'm in.

01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:38.800
Thank you so much for your time and all your work and to be continued, my friend.

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:42.960
And thank you, Nate, for this podcast because you're bringing so many voices together in

01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:47.200
one place that I know it's a hugely valuable resource for many, many people. So thank you

01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:52.240
for this hosting, very generously hosting other people's ideas. I really salute you for that.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:59.280
