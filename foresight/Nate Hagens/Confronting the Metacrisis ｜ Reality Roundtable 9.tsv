0	3840	At the end of the day we're all in this situation together and it's no individual's fault that
3840	9440	we got here but it's everyone's responsibility regardless of what decades you were born in
10240	16800	to contribute towards responding so I would love to see older generations firstly stop
16800	24320	saying that it's down to our generation. Secondly stops having conversations about these topics
24320	31040	in closed rooms amongst academic elite and instead actively engaging in the intergenerational
31040	36160	transfer of knowledge and expertise and skills so that our generation and younger generations
36160	39120	can be equipped as best as possible to face the challenges ahead.
42880	49120	Today I am joined by three humans in their early 20s who have found themselves immersed in the work
49760	55760	and scholarship surrounding the great simplification. As you might be aware the viewers of this
55760	62400	channel and this content in the world tend to skew older but it's my belief that bringing
62400	68960	young voices to the table getting their perspectives on the future, platforming their ideas is
68960	76640	essential for us to navigate the coming decades especially those young humans who have a systems
76720	83520	understanding of the complexity and the risk that we face. As such this reality round table is
83520	88560	focused on the perspectives of youth today how they feel about the current state of the world,
88560	94880	what their hopes are for the future, what their ideas are for the future of society. Joining me
94880	100880	today are Priscilla Trinh who currently serves as the director of communications at the Post
100880	107120	Growth Institute and co-coordinator of the Minnesota Youth Institute. She's the creator of
107120	112640	the Post Growth Jobs Board editor at the Blue Marble Review and contributor to the Minnesota
112640	120240	Women's Press. Also joining me are is James Branigan a writer, philosopher and content creator
120240	124800	with a YouTube channel of his own. James is committed to the task of addressing some of the
124800	130000	many facets of the human predicament with education and food production systems being
130000	134240	two of the more appealing ones for him. He is Irish and currently lives in Spain.
134880	139840	Last but not least is Natasha Lindhart who is a recent graduate of the University of Amsterdam
139840	145440	with degrees in economics and business and electives in degrowth and critical theory.
146080	151840	Natasha has been a volunteer for our organization for the past year and she will be starting full
151840	158800	time as a research associate this summer. I hope this is the first of many round table
158800	167600	discussions with young humans. I hope you enjoy it. Welcome young humans to reality round table
167600	176000	number nine, Priscilla and Natasha James. Great for you to be here. Nice to be here too. Thanks for
176000	183680	having us. Thanks for having us. You're welcome. You're very welcome. I would like to have more
183760	192000	young humans on the show because you are going to be living a long lives during the great
192000	199600	simplification and what's ahead. So let me set the stage for this. I know all three of you.
200640	207280	Priscilla was one of my students. Priscilla I've known you since you were 17 or such and you were
207280	215520	my teaching assistant for my class reality 101. James and Natasha I've met online through the
215520	222880	podcast. So I have various hats especially for Priscilla. I was a professor and a mentor and a
222880	231760	coach and a friend. For the next hour plus though I am just a podcast host. I want you each to speak
231840	239200	your authentic selves about what you believe and feel and think about our world and our future.
240080	246080	And before we get to that if you could maybe each of you give a brief introduction of who you are
246080	252800	and what you're doing right now, you know, brief bio. Natasha we'll start with you.
253680	259760	Yeah so hi I'm Natasha. I'm 23 years old and I usually live in France but I'm currently in the
259760	266000	British Virgin Islands in the Caribbean because I'm doing a few months of backpacking and traveling
266800	272560	before starting work full-time with Nate and his organization. And yeah it feels very surreal to
272560	278240	be here because I've learned so much from this podcast. So thanks for having us. Priscilla.
278800	284160	Hey everyone Priscilla Trin here. She heard pronouns. I am also 23 and calling in from
284160	290400	Oceti Shacoenlands also known as Minnesota United States and I do communications work in the realm
290400	297360	of alternative economics and food systems and that's my job and energy right now. James.
298320	307040	Hey I'm James. I'm 25. I'm Irish but currently in Granada. I just love biology and environmental
307040	313200	science and as with Natasha I came across the great simplification and it's pretty surreal to be here.
313200	318800	But right now I'm studying regenerative agriculture and how to work the land that way.
319680	326320	Excellent. Well thank you all for being here. As is usually the format I'm going to have a framing
326320	333760	question and you'll each have five plus or minus minutes and then we'll we'll carry on and have a
333760	342560	conversation after that. So I would love each of you to respond and describe your your own personal
342560	348720	journey learning about the various economic and environmental risks and crises in the world around
348720	355040	us and and how has that shaped the way you see the future and your own place in it.
355760	360720	Yes in my journey understanding about the meta crisis specifically and how the different
360720	366800	environmental and economic risks and crises are related and interconnected. That journey was
366800	371120	life changing. It was definitely a roller coaster and I'd say it was made up of a few
371120	375680	different phases. The first being a sort of awareness phase which started about two years ago
375680	380880	and that was triggered by a few different events and circumstances that maybe we can dive into later.
381440	386560	But it was basically a six month period in which I exposed myself to a lot of information
387120	392080	about the various crises we face at the moment both environmentally and socially
392160	398080	and economically and I came to realize that they were all just symptoms of something more
398080	403760	complex going on beneath the surface and that was the time period where it came across your
403760	411040	work name and across this podcast and that awareness phase really taught me firstly that we have
411040	417120	this socioeconomic reality or this economic superorganism as you call it that's the outcome
417120	422240	of institutions and behavior being oriented around profit maximization and the expectation of
422240	429440	continued growth and the dynamics embedded in that socioeconomic system are driving the crisis
429440	434000	that we face and the fundamentally incompatible with the long-term well-being of the planet and
434000	441760	of people and that realization for me was really hard to take because I'm a part of that system
441760	446960	right um we all are to lesser and greater extents so I had to come to terms with the fact that I
446960	451360	was part of something that was driving the crises that I cared about and I cared about addressing
452400	457440	and then it didn't get much better because during the awareness phase I also learned about energy
457440	466160	and about ecology and I learned that this economic superorganism and this version of humanity was
466160	471280	coming to an end and was self-terminating because it could only function by continually
471280	475840	destroying the things which its survival depends upon so that meant I had to throw all the expectations
475840	484720	I had about my future out the window and at that stage I entered a phase of grief I suppose I was
484720	490880	grieving for the death of an illusion that I'd had about reality but also about my future
490880	498240	and that period really sucked I don't want to sugarcoat it I would cry a lot whenever I was by
498240	505440	myself I felt really really lonely and at that stage I felt very powerless it wasn't very fun
506160	511040	but I will say there was 100% necessary because only by going through that and feeling those
511040	517360	things could I then get to a phase of acceptance and that phase of acceptance really meant for me
517360	523600	internalizing and really fundamentally accepting inside myself that the future was going to look
523600	527760	very different from the present that the future was going to look different to what I'd been taught
527760	536000	to expect it to look like and that this version of humanity that I'd come to consider the norm
536560	542880	and which had characterized my life up until that point was what had passed its sell-by date
543440	547040	and was going to have to come to an end if we didn't want the biosphere to come to an end first
547600	553520	and for me realizing those things and internalizing them meant that now there was no way that I could
553520	559280	have a career or a role in the world which actively contributed towards maintaining and
559280	565440	perpetuating the status quo so I had to totally redefine the role I saw for myself in the future
565440	574960	and moving forward and now I very much see that role as twofold firstly we need to be
575040	580480	putting in place safety nets we need as many people as possible going into the future with our eyes
580480	585200	wide open and planning and putting in place structures so that the transition to a lower
585200	591280	energy throughput future can be accompanied by the least suffering possible because I think there
591280	596560	will be a lot of suffering especially in terms of material wealth and I really really really fear
596560	602480	that if we carry on going blindly into the future then when shit hits the fan we will turn to the
602480	607920	worst versions of what humanity is capable of and we know that humanity is capable of some really
607920	616800	horrific stuff but we're also capable of some great things so I think the second task is to
616800	622960	actively sow the seeds and create an alternative an alternative socioeconomic reality and I think
622960	627040	that's quite an exciting task that everyone can play a role in because we need as many ideas and
627040	633840	skills as possible to create a version of humanity that can not only outlive this one
634480	639360	but also which gives the biosphere and society the best possible chance of thriving
639920	644560	long into the future so I see those as the roles I can contribute to moving forward
644560	648480	in the short term I think we need to be raising awareness and bringing this stuff into the
648480	653280	mainstream so there's many people as possible can be contributing to those tasks so that's
653280	658800	why I want to be focusing on energy on in the near future but yeah that's sort of where I'm at now
658800	662400	and to be honest since reaching the acceptance phase I'm very very content and very happy
663440	669120	and the lifestyle changes I've implemented as a result of becoming aware of all this depressing
669120	675840	content have actually had a hugely positive impact on my well-being and happiness so yes the grief
675840	682720	sucks but it's necessary and it's worth it and yeah at the end of the day we still have life
682720	690000	and that's amazing so I try to enjoy it as much as possible I resonate with Natasha's grief period
690000	695200	but I would say the metaphor I would use to describe my journey is a happy tumble down a hill
695840	702720	I was rolling down into these rabbit holes picking up flowers and rocks along the way this clarity
702720	707520	that's exhilarating like when you're rolling down a hill right but you're also as you are tumbling along
708000	712960	gaining all this knowledge there's also this back of the mind fear like what if I bump into
712960	716800	something that I don't like and I don't want to hear and it's scary to really internalize that
716800	724160	information and then finally get to the bottom of the hill and I have to look up and I'm breathless
724160	729840	by all that clarity but also exhilarated because now I'm looking up at an amazing valley and knowing
729840	736880	that even though the road ahead is very long and uphill it's beautiful because I'm not doing it alone
736880	740640	I think when people have asked this question in the past how did you get to where you are it's always
740640	745440	been explaining it as oh you know we did the canon event of going to college and becoming radicalized
745440	753120	but it's a lot longer than that having reflected on my positionality how I've come here growing up
753120	757600	in an immigrant family but I'll get back to that later I really think your classmate was kind of
757600	763440	catalyst for connecting all the dots right you realize that it's not money that makes the world
763440	770480	go around its energy and then when you combine that with an understanding of evolutionary psychology
770480	776240	it really undoes the whole monolith of human nature and it really made me appreciate the
776240	782240	plasticity of culture and that gives me a lot of hope as I learned about the biophysical limits of
782240	790720	our world I was also moving more in the direction of activism intersectional feminism was a huge
790720	796080	part of the lens in which I view the world and it was a mixture of what I learned in class but
796080	802720	also the communities and spaces I entered during my organizing years understanding that energy
802720	810640	privilege is tied to class race gender sexuality all struggles are connected and moving into how I
810640	817040	understand about the existential risk and crises really from a place of collective liberation
817040	821920	we're all in this together it's liberation for all and that includes interspecies liberation as well
822480	829360	and again undoing the whole binary and notion of tree huggers versus realists because everyone is
829360	836720	affected albeit differently and everyone is subject to being oppressed or becoming the oppressor right
836720	843040	it's not just an identity politics thing it is decolonization for everyone and it looks very
843040	850160	different for the individual and as I got more into food sovereignty spaces I have a background in
850160	856400	food systems specifically organic agriculture horticulture did hydroponics research for two years
857040	865040	and through direct action through organizing I came to really day by day I'm more convinced
865040	872080	that local community power building is where I want to be it's about channeling the big picture
872080	877440	understanding into my corner of the world right we think about how it's not effective to be perfect
877440	882080	it's not about being the perfect activist the perfect vegetarian the perfect you know
882080	889200	bike your way to work type of person in the US I feel like given where I'm at and along in addition
889200	896240	to my full-time job it's also a job to be embodied and authentic and slow and intentional like Natasha
896240	902000	said to really cultivate yourself so that you can be self-sufficient but also community sufficient
902000	908240	whatever you learn can be re-gifted to everyone around you and I always come back to this quote
908240	913840	by Audre Lorde about how caring for myself is not self-indulgence it is self-preservation
913840	919200	and that is an act of political warfare and I think now that we see everyone converging on this
919200	926160	narrative of connecting these levels and systems at play on a planetary level on a political level
926880	933040	it's really cool to be here and alive during this time and I know the word unprecedented was
933040	937760	really ruined for me during the peak pandemic era but I think it's really cool that we're alive in
937760	944640	this really unique time in history and knowing that every generation before us has had to do with
944640	952080	their own risk for me I'm gonna die before you know probably peak climate crises hits but
952640	958880	knowing that I can do something about it is fine the allure of being the charismatic
959440	965200	speaker with a huge megaphone convincing people does not hold the same weight anymore
965200	970960	for me it's really about seeing how I fit into community and learning how to then cultivate
970960	976080	myself to be a part of that community that's how I see it. Thank you Priscilla and it feels odd for
976080	980240	me to call you Priscilla because for the last four or five years I've called you Trintab
980880	987360	which I will share publicly Jeff Bridges movie living in the future's past he
988480	993920	talked about TrimTabs which is the little thing behind the rudder of a ship that influences the
993920	1002880	direction and your senior project was so colorful that I sent it to Jeff and he loved it and since
1002880	1008560	then I've been calling you Trintab so we'll put we'll put that I think there's a hyperlink to it
1008560	1016480	we'll put it in the show notes of this episode thank you James Branigan. Yeah so just a touch on
1016480	1022160	Priscilla's point that she made just there about the reduction of these complex issues into just
1023280	1029680	what I consider to be nonsensical binaries I think to overcome the allure of that because so many
1029680	1037760	people fall prey to that accepting one of the two ends of the extreme and to overcome that I think
1037760	1045280	you have to be fairly critical in your thinking and so one thing for me that I think about when I
1045280	1053120	think about this uh metacrisis or ecological issue that we're facing is that it is calling
1053120	1059520	forth the best of us as individuals because it has to we can't continue doing what we've been
1059520	1064400	doing for the past however many years you could say since the agricultural revolution to your point
1064400	1072720	about surplus accumulation and how that self-organizing around profits is one of the key
1072720	1078320	generator functions driving the problems that we face this has to change somehow not to say I know
1078320	1083840	how but somehow that has to change and just to be aware of that at first is of course the first step
1083840	1088560	but to your question about becoming aware of the ecological and economic issues I suppose
1088560	1095680	it's just a combination of like intellectual honesty and curiosity about the world because
1095680	1099680	when I was younger obviously I loved nature well that's not not so obvious but I really
1099680	1105200	loved nature I loved playing out in the fields in Ireland I loved being among the trees I love
1105200	1112400	being by the river I love making fires I loved making slingshots I loved these sort of outdoorsy
1112480	1119440	activities as a kid and so I sort of continued to follow that thread I was interested in biology
1119440	1124640	in school so then I followed that on and I wanted to remain as broad as possible in my study of the
1124640	1129920	world because this is so complex and I suppose as a young kid I was thinking all right how do I
1130480	1136480	learn as much about this as possible and not like specialize down into something too narrow
1136480	1143520	so then I went on to study general science in college or university and then environmental
1143520	1149680	science just because they're so broad but yeah so I suppose it was just a combination of that
1149680	1155920	intellectual honesty and curiosity and then also the internet the internet is a huge thing here and
1156640	1162960	the proper or appropriate use of the internet instead of falling into the trap of just being
1162960	1168400	caught by the algorithm with the short term stuff and losing your attention or losing time
1168400	1175440	by having your attention grabbed by that algorithm we can I think figure out a way to wield the internet
1176480	1182160	to our own advantage as individuals and then hopefully collectively and I think that that's
1182160	1187920	going to be one of the key tricks to figure out and I suppose I heard that actually that
1187920	1194640	sentiment echoed in an episode you did Nate with Thomas Bjorkman and he said about the Scandinavian
1194640	1203120	secret one of the keys there to modernize the Scandinavian countries rapidly was the implementation
1203120	1208480	of these schools where people could go and learn not only about the external world and what's
1208480	1215120	going on technologies so on so forth but also inner sort of spiritual or emotional development
1215200	1223680	and how the two relate to one another so yeah I guess that's it it's the internet curiosity
1224400	1232720	and just not falling prey to many of the pitfalls and traps that people who think about
1232720	1239360	the ecological crisis tend to fall prey to thank you thank you I have a bunch of questions for the
1239360	1245360	three of you are there any thoughts that bubbled up after the those the three of you spoke that
1245360	1250640	anyone would like to follow with yeah I just want to echo what James said about curiosity
1251680	1256720	because I think that's what's so special about this field is that there are so many different
1256720	1263440	ways of getting into it but for me yes I always cared about nature growing up and especially about
1263440	1267920	social issues but no more so than any other sort of environmentally and socially aware
1267920	1275440	average human so for me the reason that I'm here is purely driven by this curiosity and this
1275440	1282480	craving to understand reality and the world around me as much as possible and to get as
1282480	1288560	close as possible to the truth rather than holding to any set of beliefs and I think that's
1289360	1294880	yeah also what really motivates me in this field is that it is it's based on science and it's
1294960	1301520	based on fact and if you're curious enough to go there yeah this is where we get
1302320	1307760	in addition to that curiosity has also helped me navigate triggers you have to protect your
1307760	1313360	energy and pick your battles online especially when you're trying to be a communicator like myself
1313360	1317680	it's not about being this missionary convincing people they should care about ecological collapse
1317680	1322480	it's really leading with questions if someone disagrees with you and I try to remind myself
1323040	1326880	why do they think this way and then lead with questions rather than falling into
1326880	1333600	arguments or that divide that we see so present across geographies and cultures right now so I
1333600	1342080	love that curiosity framing. Talking about binaries let's go to the one about intergenerational
1343040	1352880	relationships with the climate and energy and economic situation I'm about 30 years older than
1352880	1359440	the three of you and so you know I've I've got 30 years of living in a world that was
1360080	1367200	largely functional and amazing under my belt now educating younger people on these things
1367200	1373520	how do the three of you and I'll let each of you speak feel about the seemingly perpetual
1373520	1381760	intergenerational conflict and blaming in our current culture and from your perspective is
1381760	1390480	it possible that we could move past such a phenomenon and and how. In one word heal everyone
1390480	1397440	needs to heal intergenerational trauma has been a big topic on my mind a good chunk of my life
1397440	1404240	and I think it's really important to unpack when talking about conflict and blaming I come from a
1404240	1409600	family of immigrants who fled the Vietnam war I'm Vietnamese my parents are immigrants and refugees
1409600	1416880	and outside of their story universally there's conflict militarism war PTSD everyone experiences
1416880	1423680	trauma to some different degree and that really affects parenting that manifests in money trauma
1423680	1429440	how we relate to the economy and that affects how we relate to each other as people and so
1431120	1436400	to address intergenerational conflict and blaming I think we have to then recognize
1436400	1441760	intergenerational value for those of us who are lucky to have elders in our lives you know I had
1441760	1448560	my grandma my maternal grandma and I think about how in the US there's such a sad attitude about
1449600	1455360	older folks there's ageism in the workplace there's ageism when it comes to political
1455360	1459280	social values but we have to know that all these movements that we're a part of now the environmental
1459280	1464720	movement the economic movement they were all founded by people who came before us right so
1464720	1470400	elders have wisdom and value and Nate I don't think you're an elder quite yet but in some ways
1470400	1475600	you are like our community elder right you have lots of ideas and experiences share right and
1476480	1481840	it comes back to the whole constraint of our economy because capitalism in the US means that
1481840	1487360	we're bound to our day jobs we have time constraints and then we don't have the time privilege then
1487360	1495200	invest in relationships and I think investing in relationships healing recognizing when our emotions
1495200	1501360	get the best of us is really key to then unlocking very generative conversations
1501920	1507280	and having intergenerational movements because it's not young people versus old people at all
1507280	1514560	you need all of us involved and one book I read recently there's an author a local author here
1514560	1519280	in the state she wrote a book called can we please give the police department to the grandmothers and
1519280	1525680	I think it was a beautiful exercise of imagination and how we can then rethink the way we relate to
1525680	1530640	one another rethink what it means to be safe because at the end of the day we're very emotional
1530640	1538080	beings and everyone is really just seeking to be heard seen understood and that affirmation is
1538080	1542000	important if we're really trying to build safety nets safety nets for whom who who is benefiting
1542000	1545760	from these safety nets we think it's good for us but maybe someone else doesn't feel safe
1545760	1551520	from that safety net so when we begin to heal and talk about mental health and really holistic
1551520	1556800	health I think it's I think it's going to be a big part in moving forward to to bridge these gaps
1557600	1563680	yeah I couldn't agree more healing is important and I remember in my mind I thought of it this
1563680	1569280	way I considered there are sort of four key elements in like the individual human's life
1569920	1574080	and I call them the most basic basics it's like food make sure you get your food right make sure
1574080	1577520	you get your exercise right make sure you get your sleep right but also make sure you get your
1577520	1582800	social relationships right so that speaks to Nate I think you formulated it by saying something
1582800	1588480	like become a fully stacked behaviorally stacked human being and you yeah you pointed the same
1588480	1597200	thing sleep food um exercise because how can we expect to face these issues and overcome them
1597200	1603520	if we're in any way ill in terms of our health that's not to say it's impossible but why not
1603520	1609840	optimize for these elements of human life because we can but to this point about blaming to be
1609840	1615920	honest I don't really I don't really see it I don't see my generation blaming the older generation
1615920	1622800	one thing that annoys me is this the fact that it's the older generations who have all the
1622800	1629120	resources and money but it's the younger generation who has all the energy but missing the resources
1629120	1634320	the money so there's a clear sort of niche there for collaboration and why it's not happening
1634320	1640880	I'm not sure so I wouldn't really blame I actually I don't even think blaming is productive what's
1640880	1648960	the use that it gets us nowhere so why not instead of blaming seek to collaborate and seek to
1649920	1655920	somehow create the mechanisms that can funnel resources from the older generations to the
1656000	1661840	younger generations in a collaborative sort of agreement between all of us
1663040	1666960	yeah I couldn't agree more with that I think it's about collaboration rather than blaming
1667520	1672880	I really see intergenerational blaming as a huge waste of time and waste of energy
1672880	1677440	because at the end of the day we're all in this situation together and it's no individual's fault
1677440	1683200	that we got here but it's everyone's responsibility regardless of what decades you were born in
1683920	1691280	to contribute towards responding and yeah as James said maybe we have our generation has
1691280	1697760	more energy or time hopefully over which to enact those responses but there is no way
1697760	1703600	that we can do it without the experience and also importantly the leverage of older generations
1704240	1709760	so I would love to see older generations firstly stop saying that it's down to our generation
1710720	1718640	secondly stops having conversations about these topics in closed rooms amongst academic elite
1718640	1725440	and instead actively engaging in the intergenerational transfer of knowledge and expertise and skills
1725440	1729760	so that our generation and younger generations can be equipped as best as possible to face the
1729760	1734400	challenges ahead and also I'd like to see the older generation engaging themselves in facing
1734400	1739280	those challenges and many are already but we need more people in all generations doing that
1740080	1746960	in terms of moving past the intergenerational blaming what I would love to see is if somehow
1746960	1756080	we could adopt a collective mentality which saw this current version of humanity not as a final
1756080	1762000	product that either has to be defended by older generations or destroyed by younger generations
1762720	1769200	but rather as a work in progress and within that having the collective maturity
1770240	1776560	to acknowledge and accept human fallibility like we're not perfect we're very very far from being
1776560	1782320	perfect we make mistakes and we get things wrong and that's okay but it means that we have to be
1782320	1786880	learning from those mistakes we have to constantly be trying to improve and I think if somehow we
1786880	1791680	could get to that collective mentality it would go a long way to moving past these cycles of
1791680	1798800	blame because it would mean that we could on the one hand be grateful for what older generations
1798800	1803120	and prior generations have given us and the experiences they've given us access to while
1803120	1809360	simultaneously acknowledging that mistakes were made and there was incomplete understanding of
1809360	1814640	reality which mean that from today we can't make those same mistakes and all of us in all generations
1814640	1820400	have to do things differently and do things better and we still won't be perfect but at least we can
1821200	1825680	work towards creating something that we can be proud to pass on to future generations.
1827360	1831760	I'm with Natasha that there needs to be shared values and I think it comes down to a rebranding
1831760	1837840	issue right I think many of us are disillusioned with ESGs and the global north framework of
1837840	1844880	environmentalism activism and systems change it's a very global north eurocentric approach and
1844880	1851200	recognizing there's a plurality of work that's been done over the years is important
1851200	1857520	in bridging the narrative right caring about our crisis is not a trend it's not something new
1857520	1861840	solidarity is not you know something that you do now because everyone else is doing it
1861840	1868400	and I think it's really flipping the narrative of how these conversations are not just happening
1868400	1872960	on podcasts for people who have time to listen to them they're happening on the ground and
1873920	1877600	it really does come back to what James was saying it's about this lack of resources
1878240	1885360	how many of us do not have time especially in the global north where we have day jobs that keep us
1885360	1889920	from advocating for things we want to do and then you got to wait until retirement when you have
1889920	1896000	time to advocate and lobby so it's this mismatch between what we're bound to financially in our
1896000	1901200	well-being because everyone needs a paycheck to survive in parts of the world now and then how
1901200	1907840	can we then cultivate time and space do that and that's going to take a bit of help outside of the
1907840	1913360	typical at least in the u.s. nuclear family or young adult living by themselves in an apartment
1914080	1919120	yeah so that is such a great point the fact that most of us don't even have the time to
1920000	1923920	engage these topics most of us are too concerned with yeah how to put food on the table
1923920	1928960	or pay the rent to have time to consider these topics and so this is actually one of the main
1928960	1933040	reasons why i'm doing what i'm doing trying to figure out i hesitate to call it like an
1933040	1938240	alternative lifestyle because it sort of has hippie connotations but i'm trying to figure out how
1938240	1945440	to live a life where i can fully study these topics and also pay the rent so i don't know
1945440	1952880	how to do that but also then attach it to your point about um like looking to the older generation
1952880	1958320	to try and teach us better about the world is i wonder of course the older generation
1958320	1963440	there's value in what they have to say but i wonder if that impulse to you know find an
1963440	1971200	authority an authoritative figure from which we can be confident um about their teachings and
1971200	1977680	how we learn about the world is itself sort of preventing us from understanding these problems
1977680	1982960	more deeply because i'm not sure the older generation even knows about how to deal with these
1982960	1988880	problems because they're so novel again it's not to say there's no use in deriving knowledge from
1988880	1994000	the older generations like nate for example the the great simplification thesis is hugely
1994000	1999200	explanatory and it helped me put the right words to the thoughts i had sort of intuited about the
1999200	2009760	world but then again i can't just rely on nate to do the work that we need to do we need to sort of
2010560	2016560	relocate the locus of authority in each of ourselves as individuals and then work in
2016560	2023680	collaboration with each other every everybody having done that towards solutions or long-term
2023680	2029840	management plans that can actually address the novelty of the problems we face is that
2029840	2036640	changing like persilla um from five or six years ago when i met you these things climate change was
2036640	2045280	known then but energy depletion and polarization and addiction and ai and some of the other biodiversity
2045280	2052640	ecological crises like PFAS and plastics and ocean issues and all these things they weren't really on
2052640	2060800	a lot of people's radar are these things commonly discussed uh with age in age groups of 23 to 27
2060800	2068480	like like you all are or is it is it um somewhat rare and in a second part of that question is
2069760	2076400	is it because of ignorance and in um energy blindness or systems uh lack of systems knowledge
2076400	2081600	or is it because i don't want to talk about this stuff i just want to enjoy my weekend and and the
2081600	2085360	beautiful day and and not have to think about these things do you have any thoughts on that
2086240	2090960	i think it really depends where you're coming from where you are located geographically and
2090960	2096400	culturally i feel like when you're talking to us it's a bit skewed right we already give a damn
2096400	2101920	but i think in the palestinian lands um that that would be a dumb question for me to ask but i think
2101920	2107680	it's becoming a bit more apparent i am very much sensing in the us and in the left bubbles
2107680	2113600	that there's this convergence on connecting the dots between economies environments and social
2113600	2122400	issues and while there is still a huge spectrum of nihilism to paralyzing fear most people
2122960	2126960	probably fall somewhere within the middle right some people are like i'm just here to make bank
2126960	2133760	do my job retire and die some people are it's out of my control it's too big i don't know what to do
2133760	2139760	let's retreat into the woods which is also just another form of dissociation and i think the
2139760	2145040	narrative happening elsewhere global south and other parts of the world maybe they don't use
2145040	2149040	the same words that we do but they are thinking about it because they have no choice but to think
2149040	2155920	about it in the us they're still quite a bit of a buffer for some folks and most folks in the us
2155920	2160960	still live paycheck to paycheck so we're very much closer to being houseless than billionaires
2160960	2167120	and i think that squeeze economically is really forcing people to think about more than just what's
2167120	2171600	hurting their wallet what's hurting their relationships and the future so i think it's
2171600	2176560	becoming more and more people's radars but they might be doing different things to address it or
2176560	2182480	using different words they might be advocating on parts of the system which i think is important
2182480	2188080	it's hard to tackle big picture always i think it's okay if it's a little fragmented and then
2188080	2194320	politically that the vocabulary is catching on but it's being so quickly co-opted that's why it's
2194320	2199120	so difficult to have these conversations because you don't know who you're in the room with anymore
2199120	2203440	someone could say the word sustainable or regenerative and you don't know if they if they mean
2203440	2208960	green growth are they a techno optimist or are they an anarchist like it doesn't it's not clear
2208960	2214720	anymore so that's kind of the the nice thing about it that with this digital amplification
2214720	2219040	you don't feel as alone sometimes because people are using a shared language but it's also very
2219040	2225440	quickly co-opted and misinterpreted so it's it's a mix of both i would say thank you james
2225440	2230320	you wanted to say something and then natasha yeah sure but uh just to the point about the shared
2230320	2238320	language thing it's just so important to understand each other and use the same language not yeah the
2238320	2242560	same language and understand that here's actually what i mean by this but that's so difficult to
2243440	2247920	flesh all of that out it takes a lot of time like the perfect example for me is the idea of
2247920	2252880	organic farming to the naive layperson he or she thinks that yeah this is like no chemical this is
2252880	2257040	pretty natural and all but it turns out that in the industry it just means something like less
2257040	2263360	chemicals than the industrial agricultural model but so yeah to the question i think for me anyway
2263360	2269200	i'd be a miss my friend group would be a misrepresentative sample because obviously i gravitate
2269200	2276080	towards these topics and so i tend to talk about them too and so i'm surrounded by people who also
2276080	2283040	tend to talk about them but not very many does that make it easier though i mean i would imagine you
2283040	2289840	you strongly value such a group oh my god i can't tell you how much i love the people the two people
2289840	2295360	i talk about this stuff with i love them so much two two of my best friends sean and my brother
2295360	2300560	patrick but uh doesn't make it easier what you mean doesn't make it easier having less people to
2300560	2308480	talk about it with or how do you mean easier well if it was just you in granada reading this stuff
2308480	2316000	online and thinking about it is not the healthiest trajectory so if you have other people to share
2316000	2321040	even if you don't come up with answers just a community i think is really important which
2321040	2328080	is why my class worked because we had 23 people in a circle talking about these things and sharing
2328080	2335440	because this is heavy stuff to take on just as an individual person yeah no doubt it makes it easier
2335440	2340640	and that's why i love that we can have this conversation now because i wonder if it will
2340640	2346960	work like an attractor and attract other people through the interwebs cyberspace to be able
2346960	2354160	to have these conversations by the time this episode airs our great simplification discord
2354160	2360720	channel will be live and people can find out where people are in the world and and have conversations
2360720	2367200	either online or in person because i think that i think that's important um natasha what what do you
2367200	2374240	think yeah i mean like james and priscilla i do also gravitate towards people who do care about
2374240	2378400	these issues and i have an amazing group of friends and we have really interesting discussions about
2378400	2385520	these things i would say that generally there is you know people in our generation do care i mean
2385520	2394800	it's our future um and there is general awareness about all these crises but there are so many barriers
2394800	2401360	to diving deeper into the sort of root causes and the why of these crises and looking sort of
2401360	2407920	beneath the surface i think those conversations aren't happening as much as they as i'd like to
2407920	2413520	see them happening and you know a big part of it is time as we've talked about people have jobs and
2413520	2418800	you've got to feed yourself and your family and and it takes a lot of time i mean for me to be honest
2418800	2425040	i spent more time educating myself about this stuff than i did focused on my university degree in
2425040	2433840	the last year of study like it's a lot of content to get through um and also there's one thing having
2433840	2439200	access to the content and the other thing is being in the mental space to be willing to take
2439200	2447120	on this content and to really engage with it um and i spent a long time in my youth being aware
2447120	2452560	of these crises but not really caring about going any deeper than that and it wasn't until i was in
2452560	2458160	a mental space where i'd removed loads of distractions from my life got off social media was creating a
2458160	2464640	lot of time and space for silence and reflection that then when the content hit me i was willing
2464640	2469040	to engage with it and get really deep into it so i think there are a lot of barriers that
2469040	2478320	we can work on removing thank you um excellent so uh i will remind you all that i am not a teacher
2479120	2486000	here i'm just a podcast host um but i just having this conversation this is like the
2486000	2491280	first conversation i've had with more than one young person at a time since i taught last in
2491280	2503440	2019 and and i do miss the the life and vitality and um curiosity and emergence uh that that comes
2503440	2509520	from from speaking with young people um let me let me ask you uh put you on the spot each of you
2509520	2514160	out of all the things that you're learning about some people call it the meta crisis i usually
2514160	2520800	call it the human predicament um you're you're well familiar with uh the different buckets of
2520800	2528480	risks and crises we face like what is one thing um in coming decades that that you're most concerned
2528480	2534000	about out of out of the whole universe uh if each of you could just speak to that for a minute or two
2535280	2542320	yeah so for me i just love my food and one of the main things that i'm concerned about is
2543040	2547200	no longer being able to produce food at the scale that we do currently because the fertilizer
2547200	2553280	pesticides and whatnot won't be available anymore or if not that the fuel for the tractors that we
2553280	2559280	rely on now to produce this food will just will be reallocated to other places or just
2559280	2564000	it just won't be there for certain local areas and that's one of the reasons why i'm doing what
2564000	2570640	i'm doing now is to relearn the old ways of agriculture not to return to an old way but
2571440	2576640	to understand how do we do this in the absence of oil and machinery i think that's a
2578400	2585440	i just find that intrinsically motivating to uh do that because for the you might call it selfish
2585440	2590400	reason that i love food not that i think the food is going to disappear in my lifetime but
2590400	2596480	just as a silly example that's why one of those with that is one of my main concerns
2596480	2603120	it's not silly and i don't consider it a selfish uh interest and i love food as much or more than
2603120	2609840	you do uh priscilla similar to james that's why i entered the field i am in right now i remember
2609840	2614560	when i told my parents hey i want to go to the college of food agricultural natural resource
2614560	2619520	sciences at the university of minnesota and they looked at me and they were like we crossed the
2619520	2624560	pacific to escape rice patties and now you want to go back into food what are we going to tell
2624560	2630080	your grandmother and i told them you tell her that as long as people eat i will have a job
2630080	2635920	and it's really the basic currency of our societies because yes we need energy to produce food but
2635920	2641040	without food there's no peace you can't change the world on an empty stomach and so i really
2641040	2647360	am concerned about our food and water quality and the the resource wars that are going to break out
2647360	2653680	um militarism is on my mind a lot everyone jokes about world war three we are living in the apocalypse
2653680	2658560	already and that's one thing that gives me hope when you understand the planetary boundaries
2658560	2664400	and the social boundaries of human patterns right all empires collapse eventually and so
2665040	2670000	thinking about it that way means that it really singles down a few of the things you should be
2670000	2674160	actually caring about and i think food and water is one of them and how are we going to set up
2674160	2680560	governance models and frameworks at different levels neighborhoods towns cities municipalities
2680560	2684960	what governance structures are in place so we can navigate these hard conversations about
2684960	2689120	how to allocate resources because we do have enough food in the world to feed everyone it's
2689120	2694800	a resource allocation problem and you know a corporate monopolization problem with big food
2694800	2702880	big ag controlling our food supply chains right now and i feel like it's doable and i don't think
2702880	2708000	the answer is a million organic farms that's not sustainable or viable it's not about everyone
2708000	2712480	becoming a farmer that's not how a society functions we need all roles all skills all
2712480	2718240	types of passions but yeah food and water is something i'm taking on myself to cultivate
2718240	2723840	skills related to that because i think it's fun like you all have said i love food and so that's
2723840	2729360	something i'm focused on both in my personal and professional life that's a difficult question
2729360	2736160	because there's so many uh risks and crises that we're facing to be honest i think i'm more
2736160	2742240	concerned with the way that we respond to those rather than the risks and crises happening because
2742240	2748720	i think they will happen and i would love to be proven wrong on that um i think that we will have
2748720	2756080	food shortages and there will be problems with water and there will be civil unrest um what i am
2756640	2763280	what scares me more is the way that we respond because if we look through history the times when
2763680	2770880	the economy's gone bad uh and we've had shortages in terms of resources that has had really really
2770880	2776480	bad knock-on effects in terms of the version of humanity that we become i mean we've become really
2776480	2788880	really awful people um so yeah what i really fear is that that this these conversations don't translate
2789760	2794800	to the things that Priscilla's talking about us actually thinking about different governance
2795360	2800960	structures and thinking about how we're going to distribute those scarce resources and how we
2800960	2809200	educate people so they have the skills to manage when we have to relocalize and can't depend on
2809200	2815280	these long supply chains um rather than just waiting for it to happen and then it turning really really
2815280	2823280	bad so i guess that's what what scares me yeah if i might just add also that that's also a motivation
2823280	2828480	for me it's not just my own love of food it's an understanding that when human populations feel the
2828480	2834000	squeeze and they see another human population over there who's doing well they this human population
2834000	2839600	who's doing poorly understands also that they can just steal what they have and that gets nasty and
2839600	2845920	that is sort of a a pattern that you can read from history that tends to happen
2845920	2853840	so following up on that each of you how do you maintain hope and cultivate resilience in the
2853840	2860720	face of what you know about the world and and i i would be so bold as to say you know more than
2860720	2871120	the average 23 and 27 year olds about all these risks and systems especially given reading the
2871120	2878800	news every day of what's going on in israel and palestine and ukraine and it's 45 degrees celsius
2878800	2888560	today in india which is like 110 or something like that you get daily reminders of this stuff so
2889120	2897600	how do you maintain hope and practice resilience and healthy habits knowing all this stuff
2898400	2903680	yeah i don't think we can just magically have hope from some external source i think we have to
2904240	2912960	actively create hope and yeah i see so much beauty in the world in nature and in people
2912960	2919920	and in relationships and communities but also in art and knowledge and culture and when i started
2919920	2927440	realizing the extent to which we're destroying that beauty in its various forms i would shift
2927440	2932640	between two mindsets on the one's hands i think well it's all fucked anyway so there's nothing
2932640	2939040	i can do excuse my french and on the other extreme i think that i have to personally save the world
2939040	2946880	and neither of those are helpful because neither of them lead to action so the mindset i've
2946880	2953680	currently developed instead through which i find a lot of resilience is firstly to feel
2954560	2959760	those things so you know i do get really really sad when i hear the news and when i see
2960880	2965920	nature suffering and people suffering i'm really feeling that but then also feeling
2965920	2973360	the joy but at the beauty that's still there so and the sort of mantra i use to motivate myself
2973360	2981360	is how can i use what i have to do what i can to protect some of the beauty and bring it forward
2981360	2986560	with me into the future and i think that if everyone does that even if it's in a really small way like
2986560	2993040	taking better care of your back garden or helping out an elderly neighbor if we all use what we have
2993040	2999680	to do what we can then we're creating hope i would say deep time deep time gives me a lot of hope
2999680	3004240	because when you zoom out and understand how we got here you realize how recent the current
3004240	3009120	order of things are dominant global north white capitalist whatever you want to call it society
3009120	3015200	is so new and back to what others have said before when you understand that it recalibrates your
3015200	3020720	expectations and that ironically gives me more positivity in the face of the poly crisis because
3020720	3025840	when you've understood that there are material financial and social limitations it recalibrates
3025840	3030720	expectations and yes that comes to the period of grief like was mentioned before it also alleviates a
3030720	3035840	lot of pressure yeah we might have some sort of mad max guns defending farm period but it's not
3035840	3041200	going to last forever right nothing lasts forever in nature and so nothing bad will last forever in
3041200	3046800	human human systems yes there will be ecological system impacts that will probably last forever
3046800	3052480	in the Anthropocene but i i think going back to that social governance like all the dire things
3052480	3058480	we're seeing in the news those will stretch out for a relatively long period of times compared
3058480	3064400	to our lifetimes but i know that the earth will rebound we will find a place in the future to
3064400	3070800	govern ourselves in a way that's equitable and sustainable and just understanding that no revolution
3070800	3074880	has been peaceful and i don't mean just like the revolution on the streets i mean the revolution
3074880	3081200	inside doing that healing work that shadow work that unlearning the breaking and creating cycles
3081840	3087280	and friend circles and families and communities it's not just about your neighborhood it's about
3087840	3096160	the regional impacts and what gives me hope is cultivating myself it's about gardening cooking
3096160	3101600	at home foraging being a better biker because right now we're living in an information economy
3102160	3106960	data knowledge cells in the future that knowledge and data has to be uploaded into our brains
3106960	3113840	it's a very fair and high 451 situation but knowing skills and having less dependency on
3113840	3118400	scary supply chains that are fragile gives me a lot of hope and empowerment make friends
3118400	3122720	with people who know skills that's how you build community it's not about having a million people
3122720	3129200	behind you and honestly you know there's that often cited often cited number of like you need
3129200	3133440	two percent of the mass to have a critical mass to do something i think it's even less than that now
3133440	3139760	considering we have relatively stable telecommunication systems right the message can be amplified so
3139760	3146480	much quicker now and so your community extends beyond geographic boundaries and then what also
3146480	3152080	gives me hope is communications really trying to use asset based communications because
3153360	3157760	that really flips the narrative it goes from deficit and scarcity which is what is used in
3157760	3164080	propaganda and news and media to really feel like we don't have what we need but we do know
3164080	3171920	what we need and we do have what we need and it's just again trying to create narratives even the most
3171920	3177760	well-intentioned circles like charities will say we need more volunteers because there's too many
3177760	3183920	poor hungry homeless folks and i yes but we could also state it in a different way that really
3183920	3192240	empowers people by saying we have the resources to house feed and uplift everyone join us in this
3192240	3197600	movement it really you know lands emotionally different in people and it might instigate action
3197600	3203440	no matter how big or small i think it's this weird world is small and big at the same time and people
3203440	3210240	do not fit into it but just pick something if it's safe enough to try go for it i think this
3210720	3216480	at least in the us the academic system that many of us go through really kind of pushes for perfection
3216480	3220800	and if it's not going to work don't do it at all but i'm trying to push back against that myself
3220800	3229440	and not be stuck in this cerebral space of just like despair so that's my take on it one of the
3229440	3237040	things that really makes me study this and makes me like want to be a human at this time is the
3237040	3242000	fact that there's no guarantee that we make it through this bottleneck or these bottlenecks
3242000	3247520	of the coming decades which is like there's a sense of danger in that and it's kind of scary
3247520	3255360	but at the same time that's what makes it exciting and then also there are like human experiences
3256160	3263440	that at an embodied level i have felt and i know like for example i love jujitsu i love training
3264240	3268640	when obviously not when i'm traveling but when i'm back in a stable environment
3268640	3276880	and there's something about that combat and exerting yourself so strenuously that after it
3276880	3281280	you're steaming up and there's just sweat pouring off you and the endorphins that are released at
3281280	3286320	the end of that and the conversations that are subsequently had with the friends that you have
3286320	3291920	made in the gym there's a comradeship there that is just a beautiful feeling and so
3293760	3299760	to maintain hope in this situation i know that that's that's like intrinsically rewarding and
3299760	3304960	valuable and there's there's no amount of theory that's gonna refute that for me i know that that
3304960	3310640	is valuable and so i say to myself okay this is worth preserving so and then i bounce out and i
3310640	3315360	as Priscilla said i try to gain a perspective and i say okay across time i would like to preserve
3315360	3320400	this if that's possible how do i go about doing that and then the how do i go about doing that is
3320400	3326960	the challenge that's the exciting part and there's no guarantee that we win but why not give it our
3326960	3333680	best shot is how i'm thinking about it so so building on that you mentioned jujitsu
3333680	3341360	priscilla mentioned a couple things maybe each of you could expand a little bit on the practices or
3341760	3348000	uh meditations or skills or new behaviors that you've incorporated in your personal life
3348560	3356320	as a response to your own understanding of of the metacrisis the great simplification and
3356320	3363920	how all these things interrelate um yeah so for me understanding the metacrisis
3363920	3369920	i had to realize that i had several behaviors and ways of thinking that i took for granted but
3369920	3377120	which were actively reinforcing the superorganism so over the last year i've tried to adopt
3377120	3383200	lifestyle choices and behavior choices which i can imagine as being more characteristic of a
3383200	3391520	more sustainable system so firstly i really tried to move away from this constant craving for more
3391520	3395280	and more more and more stuff more and more stimulation and that's a constant battle
3396160	3404800	but i've tried very hard to actively slow down my pace of life to value quality over quantity
3404800	3409040	and to remove as many distractions as possible so that i can focus on the present and what we have
3409840	3415600	and that's been helped through meditation through getting off social media and just yeah actively
3415600	3421200	creating space and time for silence and for silent reflection and learning to actually
3421200	3428240	crave the silence rather than the stimulation um so i really enjoyed that and then learning to
3428240	3433040	take joy and pleasure out of stuff that comes for free i realized that previously a lot of the stuff
3433040	3439600	i found fun was in some way associated with consumption whereas now um i take a lot of
3439600	3444640	pleasure out of things like time in nature i love going on long walks time with friends and family
3444640	3450880	an interesting conversation and dancing and writing and trying to incorporate those things
3450880	3458160	into my daily life and then in terms of mindset changes i've had a big change related to nature
3458160	3464560	primarily through food because like james i also love food and i've been putting a lot of more
3464560	3470320	intention and awareness behind what i'm putting in my body and where it comes from and i'm so lucky
3470320	3476480	that i live in an amazing part of the world with amazing local produce but this
3477600	3481600	sort of intention behind what i'm putting in my body has made me realize that my health is
3481600	3487440	totally tethered to the health of nature and of earth's ecosystems and my actions are impacting
3487440	3493200	that health and that has given me such a profound respect for nature and for all forms of life
3493840	3497920	right now when i look out the window i see life in the tree i don't just see a tree
3497920	3502800	and that's a very different mindset to oh i should make the environmentally friendly choice
3502800	3508880	because of climate change so that's been a mindset a big mindset shift for me and then
3508880	3515520	the other one i just want to touch on briefly is moving away from closed-minded in-group out-group
3515520	3523120	thinking um so i really tried to actively seek out and engage in conversations with people who
3523120	3529360	have opinions i disagree with and who come from different backgrounds or beliefs and going into
3529360	3535920	those conversations with the attitude that i want to learn as much as possible and i'm open
3535920	3540640	to the idea that i'm wrong and i'm gonna update my opinion based on that conversation and that
3540640	3546240	also has been a big a big mindset shift for me um and it's really taught me to be a lot more open
3546240	3552560	minded and to realize that i am basically wrong about everything uh yeah and i do think overall
3552560	3557200	the more i learn about the metacrisis and the more i develop sort of a nuanced understanding of it
3557200	3567040	i do think it comes down to a shift in consciousness um so yeah i try to live the change i want to see
3567040	3571520	in the world and hopefully can inspire some people to do the same because if we all collectively do
3571520	3578240	that then it triggers change higher up let me ask you uh put you on the spot natasha do you think
3578240	3585360	there's something unique in your um situation or your genetics or your upbringing or are the
3585360	3593520	changes you made that you just described um easily adaptable by people watching this episode uh that
3593520	3601280	are 23 and having similar thoughts i think that definitely these changes can be adopted by anyone
3602080	3611120	um what i will say is because i've thought a lot about this um what i think is unique in my
3611120	3620880	upbringing is that i was exposed from a young age to very high level conversations um my grandparents
3620880	3627360	lived in this little town in south of france which was like this hub of international academics
3627360	3633600	and creatives and uh yeah film directors and artists so from a young age i'd be at dinner
3633600	3639440	parties with like Nobel prize winners uh and that was normal to me and so i learnt from a young age
3639440	3648000	should i crave that learning uh and to want to be more interested in learning something new
3648000	3655520	than in whatever i believed in i think that's led me to where i am now because my involvement in this
3655520	3660240	space and this work was in no way predicated by me being like a tree hugging hippie or a radical
3660240	3666880	anarchist or whatever um it's purely from that craving for knowledge and then when finding that
3666880	3672720	knowledge that makes sense being willing to incorporate that so i think anyone can make
3672720	3680960	these changes um but it's about being willing and open to to finding out something new and the idea
3680960	3686000	that you're that everything you might have taken for granted and believed up to that point is wrong
3686720	3692960	thank you uh what like what are some practices or meditation or are new things that you have
3692960	3699040	incorporated into your personal life after integrating this into your mental uh view of the future
3699040	3703840	a very basic thing is something danios mochenberger mentioned at the norskan foundation he said
3703840	3708560	curate your social media feed so that the sorts of things that crop up are related to this like
3708560	3713120	the stock home institute planetary boundaries framework that sort of a thing and that's actually
3713120	3718400	that really works because i find myself going to my phone and then seeing this stuff late at night
3718400	3723600	and my head is like no i don't want to study that anymore i'm too tired so then i'll just put the phone
3723600	3731200	down put another thing that helps me sometimes i think of this knowledge as like a burden
3732320	3737600	sometimes i frame it in that sort of a way and i say oh my god why do i have to know all this why
3737600	3743760	do i have to be here in this time when all you and me both brother yeah when the shit's hitting the
3743760	3750640	fan and it's chaotic and it's too multuous but then i say to myself okay useless you're here now so
3750640	3756640	let's just be here and see what we can do about this and i sort of recalibrate or reframe in my
3756640	3762000	mind how i see it and i say to myself all right this is probably one of the biggest um the human
3762000	3767360	predicament the metacrisis uh slaying the super organism whatever you want to say is probably one
3767360	3774640	of the biggest challenges that humans across the whole of our evolutionary history has ever had to
3774640	3782240	face have to have ever had to face so to me that's quite um motivating and i say to myself okay so
3782960	3786800	either you step up to this challenge and make something of yourself so that you can
3787440	3792640	address it in whatever way possible and try to make that addressing it as big as possible
3792640	3797520	because i remember i actually mentioned something like doing the gardening and stuff like this and
3797520	3802080	don't get me wrong i love all that and i'm here doing the regenerative agriculture stuff but at
3802080	3808720	the same time i think there needs to be like agents of change who are so disproportionate in
3808720	3816960	terms of the consequences of their decisions or choices or actions that they they're in a position
3816960	3825040	of power that they can make those disproportionate um changes happen the whatever decisions they make
3825040	3832080	have highly are highly consequential we need to also figure out how to find ourselves in those
3832080	3837760	positions and i guess they're just a concern comes up it's like okay you you'd want to know
3838400	3843600	what you're talking about and what you're at when you're doing that so that also is quite inspiring
3843600	3849440	for me building off what others have said about phone use i think it's a very powerful tool
3849440	3855200	i myself have started to use social media more as i got older and going back to that generational
3855200	3859760	thing sometimes i look at gen alpha because i'm gen z and i'm like oh god we're fucked because
3859760	3864560	you're ipad kids but i also have to think like i don't blame you for wanting to dissociate on your
3864560	3870240	phone because the world's a scary place i dissociate on my phone too i'm subject to that habit as well
3870320	3876800	but in my role as a communicator for my day job as a friend as a neighbor i'm not going to post
3876800	3881680	something unless there's a sense of agency that you can gain from it her writing avenues and
3881680	3887200	pathways that then take action i think it's good to affirm and put out some really emotionally
3887200	3893360	charged content but i don't want to be a click to this you know where you become complacent and
3893360	3898000	complicit just because you posted something online and think yep i've done my part i also
3898000	3902560	don't want to rage farm you know that that's a term rage farming you're just fueling the
3902560	3907920	fire without really directing people to any channel of action so that's one rule i've
3907920	3913440	held myself accountable to yes affirm people but also try to provide agency where you can when
3913440	3921040	you're doing your stuff online and i think it's it's funny this ironic momentum around
3921040	3928480	reindigenizing right there's the the sense that people want to go back to the land and
3928480	3934880	live simpler lives and like really change the culture and now today and throughout recent
3934880	3940320	history certain advocates of that especially indigenous folks global south folks people of
3940320	3944800	color all other communities that have been socially disadvantaged or marginalized in the
3944800	3948880	past like that's stuff they've been doing forever but also you know to counterbalance
3948880	3952960	that with not painting a monolith right i don't think we have to look too far and many
3952960	3958960	for my observations i've noticed many immigrant families in the us who come here and fully embrace
3958960	3964640	and get ensconced in the american dream they are fully in survival mode they're they are just trying
3964640	3969440	to make as much money climb the ladder and that's a capitalist mindset and then they give birth to
3969440	3974960	children like me who are very against that so it's very complicated depending where you live the
3975040	3979840	privileges you have it's a privilege to be having these types of conversations but i think
3979840	3983840	when i am in a space to have these conversations i'm really trying to cultivate
3983840	3989600	facilitation skills how to hold effective meetings how to make everyone feel seen and heard in a
3989600	3995440	conversation for effective governance decision decision making models and i really think that's
3995440	4000160	scalable i think that's going to be pretty key to understanding the crises and then how to address
4000160	4005360	them because right now no matter what type enterprise you're in or workplace you're in
4005360	4011920	i think there's room to improve for facilitating effective like congregations of people to then
4011920	4017840	come to consent or consensus around certain issues and values then to move forward with that so
4018400	4022960	really if i'm asking people to change then i have to embody that change myself and again it's not
4022960	4027200	about being perfect it's just about being authentic and within your realms within the privileges you
4027200	4036320	hold thank you and thank you to all three of you for putting in the time to learn this stuff and
4036320	4042240	be willing to be on camera to to share some thoughts is there is there any question that you
4042240	4051280	would have liked me to ask that you'd like to close with some some comments or anything else
4051280	4056800	that each of you would like to say to our viewers no i do just want to briefly say that if there
4056800	4063200	are young people watching this who are getting exposed to this content it can be really scary
4064240	4070080	and tough if you don't have people to talk to about it so hopefully as you said Nate there's
4070080	4076560	going to be like a discord channel by the time this is out but speaking for me personally i'd
4076560	4082400	be very happy to chat to anyone who feels like they're going through this cognitive journey by
4082400	4089360	themselves so just putting that out there yes i also want to plug the emotional container model
4089360	4096240	you do really need to hold space for people to process this and i'm proud of the work that i've
4096240	4100400	done with my peers when we founded a non-profit called the Overstory Alliance and out of that
4100400	4105280	game movement school and it really was about educating and then providing a space review
4105280	4110400	to process and then providing perhaps an avenue for them people to manifest whatever change they
4110400	4113920	want they're interested in you're interested in chicken coop go do that you're interested in
4113920	4118080	building furniture go do that if you're interested in becoming part of the system changing from
4118080	4123920	within that's okay too but yeah really emphasizing the emotional container key to preserving yourself
4123920	4130080	and not burning out closing remarks i can't really say much to be honest what i would say is
4131600	4138800	because i'm not sure what it was within me that made me realize oh no that's not quite true don't
4138880	4144480	believe that or don't fall into that trap maybe there's something sort of innate to humans that
4144480	4150720	can guide us like that and i would say listen to that inner voice that guides you in that way
4151360	4156960	and don't betray it don't betray it not for money nor for people in your life who would convince you
4156960	4161520	that no no no this is the way to see the world i'd just say yeah stay true to that inner voice
4162720	4167680	i i didn't persil i don't even know if you know this but i almost called my class at the university
4167680	4173600	of minnesota things you always knew but never knew you knew but it was too convoluted and long so
4173600	4179680	i called it reality 101 instead yeah persil after you left nate you know a few of us adapted your
4179680	4183760	course to become another seminar led by students for students and we titled it what to do about a
4183760	4189200	fucked up world and we just live with humor a humor does a great service to people in healing
4189200	4196960	and navigating and honestly we live in the age of memes so why not yeah thank you all young humans
