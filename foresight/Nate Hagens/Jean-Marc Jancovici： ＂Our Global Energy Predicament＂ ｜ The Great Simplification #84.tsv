0	3680	Bienvenue Ã  la grande simplification.
3680	9120	I'd like to welcome to the show Jean-Marc Giancovici.
9120	13600	Jean-Marc is a French engineering consultant, professor,
13600	16160	author, and independent columnist.
16160	18720	He is very well known in France.
18720	22000	He's been working at the intersection of climate, energy,
22000	25120	and economics for over 20 years.
25120	30240	He's the co-founder and associate at the Carbone 4 consultancy firm,
30240	33280	as well as the founding president of the Think Tank,
33280	35280	the SHIFT project.
35280	41360	This was a weird conversation because I have never watched until a few hours
41360	46000	before this any of his work, and he's never watched any of my work.
46000	52640	And we're saying almost the same things, which to me is a robust finding.
52640	55760	And I hope to collaborate with Jean-Marc in the future.
55760	58640	Please welcome Jean-Marc Giancovici.
70560	73280	Jean-Marc, good to see you. Welcome to the program.
74640	75200	Good morning.
75200	76400	Oh, good afternoon. I just know.
77920	80640	It is almost, almost afternoon here.
80640	82160	You are seven hours ahead of me.
82720	87760	So you and I have been sharing similar stories and viewpoints.
88480	91360	From what I understand, the past two decades,
91360	93680	a lot of people have told me about your work.
93680	97840	It was only this morning that I watched one of your English videos.
98560	101760	So could you start us off by, in your own words,
102400	108160	give us kind of a long elevator pitch of how you see the human situation
108160	113280	with respect to energy, climate, systems, oil depletion, etc.
113280	114560	What's the big picture?
114560	118480	Well, actually, the big picture goes back to two centuries in rough figures.
119520	122560	The reason why we're today able to talk together,
123280	125760	even though we are thousands of miles apart,
127120	131120	and we all have a computer, and we all have plenty of food to eat,
131120	133360	and we all have a big house, and we all have
133680	139200	a means to move around, for actually not a lot of money,
140240	141360	is called fossil fuels.
142400	145200	What happened to humanity for the last two centuries
145200	148720	is that thanks to fossil fuels and thanks to machines
148720	151360	that were put in motion by these fossil fuels,
151360	157760	we have progressively replaced hard human labor by easy,
157760	161280	so to say human labor, which consists in giving orders to machines,
162240	164480	that plant and harvest the crops for us,
166960	170000	plant and harvest cotton and need clothes for us.
171760	176560	We have machines that move us around, manufacture the billions of goods
176560	178960	that we can now purchase in stores.
180000	185440	We have all these machines that fly, sail, move around, etc.
185440	188320	We have the machines that build our homes, etc.
189200	191040	Basically, we live in a world of machines,
191600	196480	and the conclusion to which I've come, I would say,
196480	201520	during the last 20 years, is that what freed the 19th and 20th centuries
203200	206640	actually bears a very simple name, coal, oil and gas,
206640	209840	and the internal combustion engine and the steam machine.
209840	213120	Basically, that's what happened to humanity for the last two centuries.
214080	217280	Thanks to our thanks, or no thanks, I don't know, to fossil fuels,
218240	222640	the number of people on earth grew from 1 billion to 8 billion.
222640	229200	Life expectancy at birth went from, let's say, a little bit under 30 in 1800
229200	233760	to the world average is probably around 65 today.
234720	238080	Even in India, life expectancy at birth is over 70,
239360	245520	so we have, again, all the material goods that we have today
246240	247520	is due to fossil fuels.
248320	256000	This has also framed the geography and, I would say, settlements of people,
257200	262240	as it is no longer necessary to have people in the fields growing fruit.
263040	268960	We have progressively shifted to industrial, then office jobs,
268960	274720	or tertiary jobs, so to say, that we have in cities.
275520	282240	We progressively went to a type of settlement where most people live in cities,
282240	284560	and actually you can observe that everywhere in the world,
284560	287760	the more energy per capita you have and the more people live in cities.
291680	299680	The modern urban world with people working in offices or in commercial buildings,
300640	307680	living at home and owning a car is basically the way of living that you have everywhere
308720	310640	when abundant energy comes in.
311440	313200	It's basically what happened everywhere.
314240	316960	And, of course, this comes with the price.
318240	324160	Actually, the first price that it comes with is that all these fossil fuels have changed the
324240	329920	composition of the atmosphere through their burning, and it has increased a natural effect
329920	335840	called the greenhouse effect that was discovered by a French two centuries ago, Joseph Fourier,
336640	337840	in 1824.
338960	345520	And this greenhouse effect is being increased or enhanced by all the extra CO2 that we pour
345520	349840	into the atmosphere, knowing that the CO2 is a very stable molecule because it's an oxide,
349840	352400	and oxides are very stable chemical compounds.
353360	358640	And it leads to a change of the climate system, a climate drift, so to say,
359600	361600	which is going to be an increasing burden.
362640	368400	And the other price that we have to pay is that all this, I would say, industrial civilization
369680	377440	rests on non-renewable resources that we have to use and destroy when we use them
377680	383760	more and more, fossil fuels, they need, we destroy them when we use them, but also metals.
384320	389040	Today, our modern civilization needs all the metals that we have found on Earth.
390000	395760	The computer that I'm using right now and that you are using right now needs 40 to 60 different
395760	397040	metals to be manufactured.
397040	409520	So the civilization that we have built is increasingly complex and dependent on
409520	411760	non-natural resources that can be depleted.
413360	418640	So the two main challenges, I would say, the two main global limits that we face today
418640	424160	is a global limit regarding the environment that cannot accept all the waste that we pour
424160	432560	into it, CO2 being one of it, being one of the, I would say, the best documented and addressed
432560	442000	today, but there are many more, and an upstream bottleneck on non-renewable resources that we
442000	443440	would like to have more and more.
443440	445360	And it's not sure that we will have more.
446000	450080	Actually regarding oil, it's almost sure that we will not have more and more.
450080	451920	And in a couple of years, we will have less and less.
452640	453840	Globally speaking, in the world.
455520	456960	So that's the challenge we address.
457520	462720	And one of the difficulties that comes with it is that very few people understand the challenge
463360	468480	because it is not something that you can get through the most common indicator that we use
469920	471200	every day, which is money.
472640	480240	The challenge that I just evoked is not embedded into current prices because basically
480240	481840	natural assets have no price.
483120	486640	And so we cannot realize that there is a challenge through prices.
487760	492560	But it happens that the only quantitative indicator that we use every day is money.
494800	496720	You don't take your block pressure every day.
496720	500320	You don't measure the amount of CO2 that you put into the air every day.
500320	503600	You don't measure the mass of copper that you use every day.
503600	505920	I mean, the only thing that you count every day is money, basically.
506880	511840	And so the difficulty is that as the challenge is not embedded into prices,
513120	520000	it is very difficult for people that have not devoted their life to studying the challenge,
520000	523840	as I have done, to understand it easily.
524720	528720	Magnifique, that was a better summary than I've ever done, I think,
528720	530480	even though we're telling the same story.
531040	536640	When was your red pill moment, Jean-Marc, when you first realized how central that
536640	543520	energy was to the entire civilization and our expectations and everything?
543520	546320	Actually, I had a collection of red pills, of small red pills.
548880	553440	My first red pill was when I realized the magnitude of the challenge regarding climate change.
554960	559280	Actually, historically, I came to climate change before coming to energy.
561040	568560	The way I got my revelation, so to say, is that at the end of the 90s,
569680	578480	I was working in the telecommunication sector, and it was the time where the operators were
578480	581600	very excited by the idea of developing remote activities.
581600	587680	It was the beginning of telework, remote learning, and all these things.
588640	594960	And I was as a basic consultant during business plans for the main French operator
594960	599040	in telecommunications, Orange, today, at the time it was France Telecom,
600720	604640	and studying the fact, well, looking at the fact that
606160	612560	home offices could spare people moving or could spare car commuting.
612880	621360	I came across the word greenhouse gases, and I asked myself, what is that?
622560	626080	So I began looking, so that was my first red pill moment.
626880	631600	I understood that we were changing the composition of the atmosphere, and that it could,
632320	636480	I would say, trigger a change of climate era in one century.
637440	642400	Whereas in the past, it was done in 10,000 years with people able to move around,
642400	644400	which is not the case today, because we have settled.
646800	655600	My second red pill moment was when I tried to understand what was causing this,
655600	660400	and the link between the way we live and energy.
661040	665360	And my second red pill moment was when I realized that actually,
665360	674080	energy or the increase of energy supply had been the main driver over a century, say,
675360	677440	that frayed all the countries in the world.
678000	683200	Basically, you give machines to a country, and the evolution is always the same.
683200	686560	People leave the fields, go to factories, then to sit, then to offices,
687120	688080	live in cities.
688080	691760	They are purchasing power increases, they get retirement, they get long studies,
691760	696560	they get vacations, they get their weekends, they work less in the week, they vote.
697280	699840	I mean, everything came in with energy.
701040	704560	And that was my second red pill moment, because then I asked myself,
705760	710000	where will the world go the day we have less and less energy?
710720	716000	Will we keep democracies, or will we have rights everywhere and social unrest?
717120	719840	Which is unfortunately happening here and there more and more.
721680	726480	Will we keep peace, or is something that won't happen?
726480	734480	How are we going to, in a way, become sober without the whole society collapsing?
737280	743520	I still haven't the complete answer, but that was my second red pill moment.
743520	747760	Then I had another red pill moment when I realized the way democracies operate.
749360	754560	And I realized that a fast reaction to that issue would not happen.
756400	758640	That was, I would say, a third red pill moment.
758640	763040	So I had at least three, and maybe through our discussion, I will discover that I have more.
763600	766320	Yeah, the room is full of red pills.
766320	769360	We actually have so much in common on how we see this.
769920	775280	So if I was an economist or a world leader listening to your summary,
776160	783680	I might say, yes, but it's technology that caused all the increase in population and the increase in
784240	789760	wealth and services and the increase in city and retirement and vacation.
789760	791760	It's human innovation that caused it.
792720	795520	Do you encounter that pushback, and how do you respond to it?
795840	804480	Well, it's an easy answer, because actually, to spread technology, you basically have to spread the
804480	807200	objects that embed the technology.
807200	813680	So you have to manufacture plenty of objects, and manufacturing plenty of objects per the name,
813680	819040	which is energy, because you need plenty of energy into the industrial system.
820320	822240	I can put it the other way around.
822240	826720	Tomorrow morning, you don't have much energy, and you can't manufacture cars anymore.
827920	832720	Even if you have brilliant engineers, how do you spread technical progress in cars?
832720	835120	If you can't manufacture cars, obviously you can't.
835920	840800	And if you can't manufacture cars that people can't use, because there is no energy to use the cars,
840800	843840	how do you spread technical progress in cars?
843840	844240	You can't.
844880	851360	So it's very easy to explain that actually spreading technical, finding something which is new
851360	852560	doesn't require much energy.
852560	855360	Actually, it requires a little energy, because it requires free time.
856800	864400	In the Middle Ages, people were busy feeling themselves, because it's the first need of humanity.
864400	868160	And once the day was over, and they had worked all day to feed themselves,
868160	873040	they had no spare time to find whatever the proton, or the neutron, or the electron,
874240	878720	or the way to conceive the electric energy.
879040	886640	One of the reasons why we have plenty of researchers today able to, and Mr. Musk and
886640	891360	hire plenty of engineers, is that precisely machines are growing the food for us.
892000	896000	If we're a busy harvesting potatoes, we wouldn't do any research.
896800	898320	Wouldn't have the time to do so.
898320	903840	When you look at countries that are still very sober regarding their energy consumption in Africa,
903840	907920	for example, they do not have many engineers, and they don't have many researchers.
908560	914960	So it's also the result of abundant energy that we can have research and technology.
914960	918880	But to spread, again, technology, we need plenty of energy,
918880	920880	because we need to manufacture plenty of objects.
921520	929280	So there are a lot of very ambitious technological plans in the future,
929280	939040	such as net zero. And there are promises of decoupling or dematerializing GDP from energy
939040	942240	and materials. What are your thoughts on that?
942880	950800	So far, it never happened. Actually, 15 years ago, I began doing something very simple,
952000	956640	which is plotting the world GDP against the world energy consumption.
957600	964560	I've got data going up to 1965, and I was astonished to discover that I got almost a
964560	970640	straight line. So when you plot the world GDP in constant dollars against the world energy
970640	975120	consumption, which is actually the size of the active fleet of machines in the world,
975120	979360	that's what the energy consumption is, you get almost a straight line,
979360	982640	you have a little improvement of the energy efficiency every year.
982640	986640	So actually, it's not exactly a straight line, something which is slightly convex,
987680	993040	but you get almost a straight line. And the reason why is very simple, actually,
993040	999360	to have as long as the GDP counts the same thing, that is square feet of construction,
1002080	1008320	goods moving around, goods being manufactured, number of ships operating in the world, etc.
1008320	1015200	You have physical things. And in the physical world, you have rules that you cannot,
1015200	1019920	sorry for the repetition, overrule. I mean, like for example, to put a mass in motion,
1019920	1027440	you require a minimum energy, which is the mass times the square of the speed times one half.
1028400	1033600	And you cannot say it's one quarter, because it would be, I would save energy if it were one
1033600	1037120	quarter. So I'm going to vote at the Congress that it's one quarter, you can't do that.
1038080	1046640	It's always one half. So you have limits, you can near the limit, but you cannot overcome it.
1047680	1055760	I'm going to take another example. To go from iron ore to iron, you have to remove the oxygen
1055760	1062720	in the iron ore. Actually, iron ore is an iron oxide. The most common molecule in iron ore is
1062720	1071040	two atoms of iron for three atoms of oxygen. To remove the oxygen, you use carbon, coal,
1071040	1079040	actually, metallurgical coal. You need 1.5 atom of carbon to remove the three atoms of oxygen,
1079040	1085600	and it will never be one, and it will never be 0.8. It will always be 1.5. So in the physical
1085600	1091280	world, you have physical limits. And it's the reason why when you look at the energy consumption
1091280	1097440	per physical unit, per kilogram of steel, per kilogram of copper, the improvement actually
1097440	1102960	is very low. It's very slow. It doesn't go fast, and you have an absolute limit that you cannot
1102960	1111920	overcome. So in the future, we might even degrade the energy efficiency of the industry,
1111920	1117680	because the concentration of copper in the copper ore, for example, decreases with time,
1117680	1122720	which means that you need more and more energy to get 1 kilogram of copper. And so at the
1122720	1127600	certain point with time, you will not have an improvement of the energy efficiency of mining
1127600	1132240	copper, but you will have a degradation of the energy efficiency of mining copper.
1133280	1140800	So but again, when you look at the past, you have there is no decoupling at the world level.
1141680	1145840	You have a slight decoupling in some given countries, but that's thanks to trade,
1146480	1153040	because you have the added value in the country, and the industrial process that or the physical
1153040	1159280	flow that provides this added value, which is outside the country. So it's an illusion. When
1159280	1163760	you look at the world as a whole, you have no decoupling in the past, and there is no major
1163760	1168880	reason that you can get a decoupling in the future. Jean-Marc, have you ever watched one of my lectures
1168880	1179200	or any of my videos? I confess that I have not done so recently. Well, then I'm very happy,
1179200	1185040	because you are telling my story, and we've never met and never watched each other's videos,
1185040	1190400	which means the story is robust. I feel like I found a brother from another mother. I mean,
1190400	1197360	I say these same things over independent research for the last 20 years. And I just
1197440	1206320	question why it is that so few people have connected these dots. And I suspect that one
1206320	1212480	reason is that the total, as you said earlier, the total amount of energy available to society
1212480	1220560	is increased every year, and that is hiding all of the future assumptions and plans just
1220560	1228960	implicitly assume that will continue. So they miss the centrality of energy abundant and cheap
1228960	1234560	are contributing to our society. Why do you think you and I and many others have been
1235200	1240480	talking about this for 20 years, and it is still not, well, maybe in France it has, but
1240480	1248000	elsewhere in the world, this is still a narrative of technology and money. And energy materials
1248000	1255840	are out in the distance in the explanatory stories. You're geographically closer to the answer than I
1255840	1262400	am. I believe that it's a consequence of the University of Chicago. That's where I went to
1262400	1272320	graduate school. Yeah, okay. Basically, it goes back to what I said earlier. Many people in the
1272400	1278640	economic world believe that physical constraints are embedded into prices. And one of the things
1278640	1284400	that they believe is that there is an elasticity between prices and volumes. So that if you near
1284400	1290320	a limit, you will see it into prices. And if you don't see anything into prices is that you are far
1290320	1296160	from the limits. I will explain in a couple of seconds why it is false for commodities that are
1296160	1302640	essential to our modern economy. For oil or steel, for example, it is false. I can explain that
1302640	1310720	very easily. There is no elasticity. And that's one of the reasons why. Of course, and it goes back
1310720	1315600	to framing. Actually, it's not the fault of the University of Chicago because before that it was
1315600	1322880	the fault of French and English thinkers, earlier thinkers, early thinkers, sorry, of the classical
1322880	1329680	economy. Two centuries ago, basically, the classical economist said, in the world, we are
1329680	1336880	going to count what is the limiting factor of production, which is the economic science. Basically,
1336880	1342880	it is addressing the limiting factors of production. And at the time, two centuries ago,
1343600	1350080	basically, the economy was still a lot centered on agriculture. There was a little industry,
1350080	1357120	but basically. And what they said is that there is plenty of land, plenty of resources. We don't
1357120	1363920	lack iron ore. We don't lack coal. The only thing that we can lack is human labor and human capital.
1364640	1370720	So the only thing that we are going to count is human labor, which is a way, a kind of energy,
1371280	1379520	but it's a slight part of the energy that we can get. And human capital, which is also a limiting
1379520	1387120	factor, but there are plenty other limiting factors among natural capital. If you are a fisherman,
1388160	1393600	you need a natural capital, which is fish. You don't only need human capital, which is a boat,
1394800	1400400	and you don't need only sailors. You also need, particularly if you're a modern fisherman,
1401440	1407920	a little oil or a little diesel oil to put into the engine. So basically, and what they have done
1407920	1413760	is that they have invented that technological progress, which is, for example, the solo residue
1413760	1422560	in Solo's vision, which is the total productivity of factor. If you look at Copto Glass, etc.
1422560	1429200	So they invented that term, which cannot be predicted, which can only explain,
1429200	1435680	exhaust what happened, which is fantastic, which was called technological progress. And which,
1435680	1441040	actually, when you look carefully at things, is energy machines and natural resources. That's
1441040	1447920	what actually it is. But as it is not explicit, people stick to prices, and they believe that
1447920	1453840	with prices, you can explain all what happens to the productive system. Now, why is it false that
1453840	1459440	we have no elasticity between prices and volumes regarding oil or steel, for example? It's because
1459440	1465200	these commodities are essential to modern economy. If you produce less oil in the world, if you have
1465200	1471600	less oil, you will have less cars, less trucks, less planes, and less boats that can operate.
1471600	1478480	Therefore, your economy will shrink a little. And if the economy shrinks a little, people earn less,
1478480	1484080	because basically, the revenues are equal to the production. That's basic macroeconomic
1484080	1489920	formula. So if people earn less and have less money, and you have less oil to offer them,
1489920	1495760	you don't know whether the new equilibrium price of oil will be higher or lower than the former
1495760	1500560	price. And actually, when you look at past prices, there is no clear relationship.
1501760	1506480	With less oil, you can have prices that are lower, prices that are higher, you can get everything.
1507120	1512160	Same thing for steel. The modern world fully relies on steel. If you have less steel,
1512160	1517200	it's an essential commodity for the economy. So if you produce less steel, you will destroy
1517200	1524000	a little part of the economy. Therefore, producing less, people earn less, and then again, the new
1524000	1529600	equilibrium price of steel has no reason to be higher or lower than the previous one. So there
1529600	1535600	is no elasticity between prices and volumes for communities that are essential to the functioning
1535600	1540560	of the economy. If you take a commodity which is non-essential, like handbags, for example,
1541280	1545920	if you produce less handbags, of course, it will not destroy the economy. You have this,
1545920	1550480	people have the same purchasing power, only you have less handbags. And so the price of the handbag
1550480	1559760	goes up. So that's okay. But this relationship, it doesn't apply to commodities that are essential
1559760	1569760	to framing the modern economy. Which is why, for example, you won't see oil depletion coming through
1569760	1576880	oil prices going forever up. You will see them with GDP going forever down.
1577920	1585600	That's the way you will see it. But nominal prices. And today, as economists have never looked at the
1585600	1592640	relationship between energy and GDP, when the GDP goes down, it's the fault of bankers, people that
1592640	1598640	don't want to work, lazy, whatever, but they never see energy in the picture.
1600560	1608000	So there's a biophysically economist who used to be on our advisory board called Reiner Kumo,
1608640	1618880	who explained the solo residual is almost all energy. And I think if we did it on a global
1618880	1625040	basis, it would be like over 90% of it. I think his numbers were 60 some percent. But yeah,
1627520	1634560	excellent. So what are your thoughts? You mentioned money and GDP. What are your opinions on finance
1635200	1641920	and quantitative easing as adding false or temporary wealth to the economy in the last couple
1641920	1648160	decades? And how does that affect some people's claims that we're decoupling energy from GDP?
1650080	1654640	I am not an expert on quantitative easing, but one of the conclusions that I've come to
1654640	1661920	is that it led to an inflation of assets. Actually, there is an old theory that says that when you
1661920	1668880	create money in excess, compared to the physical possibilities of the economy to produce something,
1669520	1676880	it leads to inflation. Actually, what happened during the last 20 years is that creating money
1677520	1686960	didn't lead to inflation in common goods, but it led to inflation in assets, real estate, stocks, etc.
1687920	1693280	So that's what happened basically. And that inflation of assets is not fully corrected
1694240	1701280	in deflating all that you count in the GDP. For example, if you have a square meter, sorry,
1701280	1709360	a square foot in a building, which costs twice the price, you will need a mortgage,
1709360	1717200	which is twice the amount. And you will count the production in banks as twice the previous
1717200	1722560	production. You will not deflate that production on the basis that it's always a square foot
1723520	1728640	it is physically still the same goods, only costs twice the price. And so you have no reason
1729360	1738080	to count twice the bank added value. And you have that same thing for the stock market.
1739040	1745760	If stocks go up, you will not deflate that saying, okay, it's always a stock, it's always the same
1745760	1752240	company. There is no reason to count it for twice or 10 times the price. And I have never
1752240	1757760	had the opportunity to make precise calculations to see what would have,
1758880	1765520	how the GDP would have evolved if we had discounted, so to say, the inflation of assets
1765520	1770480	from the GDP. But my belief is that it would have removed something, a little something.
1770480	1775360	And the other thing that we should have removed from the GDP basically is the debt,
1775360	1781920	because if you increase the GDP that you count today, through increasing the debt that you
1781920	1792480	have to reimburse tomorrow, normally, you should have an accounting closer to a certain liability
1792480	1799600	accounting than to a P&L accounting, which is what we do. So you should count something for
1799600	1806720	the creation of debt that you should deduct from today's GDP. And that correction also has never
1806720	1811760	been made. And the level of debt has never been as high, well, actually for the last century,
1811760	1818720	I mean, it's never been as high as today. Except for the Second World War.
1818720	1825520	It's even higher than that now as a percentage. But all that debt, Jean-Marc, when it's called in,
1825520	1831680	when it's created to be paid down, is a claim on energy. So all the debts that exist in the
1831680	1836400	world when they're eventually paid down, and we don't have that amount of energy. So I think
1836880	1842720	this one piece alone is being completely missed by the financial markets, in my opinion.
1843360	1847120	Well, my belief is that it will end through inflation or default,
1848160	1854640	or a mixture of the two. I, of course, have a preference for inflation because it's softer.
1856240	1862640	But obviously, we are building a kind of policy pyramid, and we all know how it ends.
1863520	1869760	But I agree. If you need extra GDP in the future to reimburse the debt, it means that you need
1869760	1877280	extra energy. And you don't see how it fits if we have less and less energy in the future.
1878400	1884000	So temporarily, we can print more money, which is a facsimile for more energy,
1884000	1887040	but it just extracts the existing energy we have faster.
1887840	1895120	I am not sure that it had a major effect on extraction of energy. It did have,
1895120	1907760	in the US, a significant effect on the sharehold industry, because during between 2010 and 2018,
1908480	1916000	during the share boom, as you probably know, share operators didn't earn a single back.
1917040	1923840	Actually, they were all losing money. And they were also building a kind of policy pyramid.
1924880	1931920	They were burning cash and refinancing themselves with new stock and new debt.
1933680	1940080	Until one year before COVID, the financial sector said, now, now, end of the game,
1941040	1945920	we want our money back. And actually, the only way to get the money back is to stop drilling all
1945920	1953600	the time. Because with drilling all the time, you have huge capex and you just burn cash,
1953600	1959840	I mean, you cannot earn money. And the paradox of sharehold is that you can earn money only if you
1959840	1965520	do not increase production too fast, or if you do not increase it at all. But quantitative easing
1966400	1975520	did favor that movement, the extraction of sharehold. It did have an effect.
1975520	1980960	But after shale oil, there's nothing left except for oil shale, which is basically uncooked
1981680	1987760	rock with oil in it. So this is, that's not going to work.
1987760	1996000	Sorry, at the SHIP project, which is an NGO that I chair in France, we have done a thorough analysis
1997040	2002320	with the data coming from Reichstadt Energy. We had access to the full database of all the
2002320	2008880	oil fields in the world for a very minimum price. And we published, I think there was an English
2008880	2018880	version, our research on the projections that we make only under geological constraints,
2018880	2024400	we do not mention above ground constraints, political pressure, climate, whatever.
2025040	2032720	On the perspective of the 16 top suppliers of Europe, that includes US,
2033440	2038720	which happened to be the 16 top producers in the world except Canada, which is a significant one,
2038720	2045040	and Brazil. And the result of our work is that the production, the combined production of these
2045040	2053200	16 countries should be divided by two between now and 2015, including sharehold and including
2053200	2065360	Tassen. So 27 years from now, cut in half. By 2050, the combined production of these 16
2065360	2075600	top suppliers of Europe, which includes all the Middle East, Russia, all the US, Mexico,
2077760	2082480	all the 16 top producers in the world, but Canada and Brazil, the production should be
2082480	2090640	divided by two, including sharehold. That's almost best case, unless there's some new technology,
2091280	2097840	because it doesn't account for geopolitics or climate inability to get water to process the
2098400	2105200	mining or any any other complexity problems or things like that. I would say it's a no crisis
2105200	2111200	scenario. Yeah, I think that's plausible. I would expect my numbers might be a little bit higher,
2111200	2119280	but in that ballpark. So on that note, Jean-Marc, my personal stance, and I expect you would agree
2119280	2126560	that on a grand scale, climate change is the most existential issue that humanity faces this century.
2127840	2133520	However, you and I both believe that fossils are going to become economically unavailable
2133520	2139280	sooner than our cultures are planning for. That eliminates a lot of the more extreme
2139280	2144000	climate scenarios that some reports predict. What are your thoughts on that?
2144720	2152960	What it excludes in my view is the most extreme temperature increase coming from greenhouse gases,
2154400	2162880	but it doesn't exclude consequences much more unpleasant than what we today believe,
2163680	2170240	coming from the scenarios that remain plausible with the amount of fossil fuels that we can access
2171120	2178880	if I develop a little bit. I do believe that the higher end of the bracket regarding scenarios,
2178880	2186160	which is emissions, growing and growing during the 21st century is plausible, because my belief is
2186160	2193360	that we will experience some kind of slow collapse before the end of the century, preventing the
2193360	2200960	economy from growing and so preventing emissions from growing. So the scenario which is a healthy
2200960	2210400	economy and healthier and healthier economy becoming bigger and bigger until 2100 and
2210400	2215360	powered by fossil fuels is something that I don't believe possible. I don't deem it is physically
2215360	2228320	possible. What is possible is that we get a peak fossil sometime around 2050, 2060 or so,
2229760	2238640	but that would be enough to trigger a three degrees plus scenario. What I want to elaborate
2238640	2244720	is that the consequences of a three degrees plus scenario might be much, much more ample
2245360	2252720	than what we believe today, because there are plenty of processes with threshold effects
2252720	2259280	in the world, and basically we discovered them when it's too late. I will give a couple of
2259280	2265520	examples. 10 years ago, I had never heard of the possible collapse of the western Antarctic ice
2265520	2274720	sheet, which is today considered possible, starting from 1.5 degrees of global warming.
2276000	2281760	10 years ago, I had not heard of the possible complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet
2281760	2287040	in a couple of centuries, of course, which is something which is today considered possible,
2287040	2296240	not certain, but possible. 10 years ago, I had not heard of the possibility of the whole Amazon
2296240	2303600	forest turning into a dry forest or even a savannah, which is something which is today
2303600	2311520	considered possible, et cetera, et cetera. Basically, and I remember that 20 years ago,
2312320	2322640	I did some kind of TV show in France, and we elaborated a false weather forecast for
2322640	2332240	2019, and the temperature that we mentioned was 40 degrees Celsius, which is something that we get
2332240	2341120	today each summer in France. Basically, my belief is that we should not be reassured
2341840	2349120	by that. The higher end of the warming is not possible, but the higher end of the consequences
2349120	2357040	that we get for a given warming today will be overcome. The reason why is that the models
2357120	2361760	that go from a global temperature increase to the consequences in a given sector,
2362800	2370320	being the possible dismantling of an ice cap, or the evolution of yields regarding maize or rise,
2371200	2378720	are models that are built with the past variability, and they do not embed the
2378720	2384000	possible future of variability. And some recent research has been published in nature
2384000	2390880	saying that if we increased a lot the variability in the future of climate parameters,
2391680	2396160	we get damage which is much, much higher, but if we do not do that.
2396720	2401680	I totally agree with you. Yeah, we don't have enough to meet the high threshold,
2401680	2408640	but we have plenty to have a disaster in the climate. So I have so many questions for you.
2408640	2414640	Let me just keep firing because you are giving succinct and very articulate answers,
2414640	2417760	not in your native language, by the way, so thank you for that.
2419760	2427280	So a main news story in France, kind of ongoing, has been protests and unrest over the raising of
2427280	2433760	the retirement age and the threshold for pension fund access. Do you think that this connects back
2433760	2439200	to energy scarcity, and do you think we'll have more of this type of response, or do the French
2439200	2447200	just have a certain proclivity for civil unrest? Well, without the two. We like to complain,
2448000	2458480	which is a national sport here, to complain, but the fact is that we today have retirement
2459040	2463600	thanks to abundant energy. I mean, two centuries ago, there was no retirement.
2464400	2470880	Actually, it's not true. Retirement was invented by Colbert four centuries ago,
2471520	2478720	and he did that for the Royal Navy. And at the time, there were 20,000 sailors,
2478720	2485360	and you could get retirement when you turn 60, and believe me, in 1600 something,
2486240	2490880	turning 60, which means surviving Scorbert and adverse fire.
2492880	2496960	I mean, he didn't make a major risk with the budget, our friend Colbert.
2499680	2507600	But thanks to energy now, we have so much production given by machines that we can feed
2507600	2514800	and provide clothes and housing and cars and everything to people that work, in quote,
2514800	2519520	which is giving orders to machines today, working, and people that do not work,
2519520	2523760	but some of them physically do exactly the same thing. You see, for example, today,
2523760	2528640	I'm supposed to work. I'm a consultant, I'm sitting behind an office, and I work. What is
2528640	2535360	working for me talking to you? Is that work? It is not work. I mean, if I, if in a couple of hours,
2535360	2539360	I will talk to somebody else doing exactly the same thing, sitting on a chair,
2539360	2543840	will not, will not be through a computer, and it will not be work. It will be later. I mean,
2543840	2548320	what is the difference in physical terms? No difference. So what we call work today
2548320	2553760	for plenty of people is something that middle-aged peasants would have called leisure,
2554560	2560720	sitting on a chair and talking, or sitting on a chair and typing on the, on the, on the, on the
2560720	2565600	on the keypad of a, on the type pad, sorry, of a computer. Well, okay, big deal. It is not work.
2566400	2573920	So retirement is actually a gift of abundant energy. You have no retirement in countries
2573920	2578800	that are very sober regarding their energy consumption. And so of course, unfortunately,
2578800	2585360	I have to say the long-term trend is that in the future, it will be harder and harder to retire.
2586080	2592240	So building on that, let me ask you a difficult question. I frequently cite that a barrel of
2592240	2598160	oil is worth around five years of human labor. You've made similar statements,
2599520	2607360	including that we've essentially replaced slave labor with, with fossil fuels. So if energy supply
2607360	2612480	is going to contract, it's not, it's my, it's my, it's my order of magnitude. I've got exactly the
2612480	2618960	same order of magnitude. Yes. Well, it's five years of work. Yeah. Of hard or very hard work.
2619040	2624240	Yeah. Very hard work. Yes. Well, it's the actual math is around 12 years, but humans are more
2624240	2629280	efficient with directing muscle labor to actual work. So you have to handicap it, but it's around
2629280	2635920	four and a half, five years. So, so you just suggested that of the 16 exporting countries
2635920	2642720	that Europe imports oil from, they'll be cut in half their production by 2050 plus or minus.
2642720	2650400	So if we contract energy supply, we're con, we're also GDP and jobs are also going to shrink. So do
2650400	2657680	you think it's likely or possible that we see a resurgence in things like slavery as fossil
2657680	2663040	energy availability declines and, and do you have hopes that we can avoid such a scenario?
2663040	2675520	It's my fear. My fear is that relationships between humans will become, I would say,
2676640	2685920	harder than they were, but we'll have more. I don't know how the expression in English
2686800	2696000	uphold the force. We'll have tensions between humans and brutal force
2697120	2704640	will be more important than, than, than it was. Of course, I'm not sure that we'll have less,
2704640	2714320	less work. We might have less jobs or less revenues. But, but when we had no machines,
2715040	2720400	we worked harder. So I do not know exactly how it's going to recompose. I mean, but
2721840	2730720	the main ideas are we'll work, we'll have more hard work, and we'll earn less, basically,
2730720	2739360	because what energy did is triggering the exact opposite, working less, and, and, and earning more.
2739520	2745520	That's what I refer to as the great simplification, the name of this podcast,
2745520	2750320	based on Tainter's premise of complexification required energy.
2750320	2758480	If, if it's possible, because you see two centuries ago, the world economy relied on
2758480	2771920	only nine metals. It relied on iron, copper, zinc, tin, lead, and a couple of them more.
2773040	2779280	Today, you do not have a single element of the table of Mandelaev that doesn't have an industrial
2779280	2789120	application, not one. And you and I, we depend on all these 92 elements, because, for example,
2790000	2798320	you depend as I depend on, on the digital system, which by itself requires 60 to 70 different
2798320	2803360	elements. Today, there is no single company that can operate within, within an information system.
2804000	2810960	No one. I mean, if you go back to paper sheets and pencils, you cannot operate any company today.
2812480	2821920	We, so basically, in simplifying the present world is going to be extremely hard, extremely hard.
2823440	2829680	So you're getting at complexity, which I refer to as one of the big four risks that we face.
2830160	2836000	I consider them to be the financial system, geopolitics, complexity, and the social contract.
2836640	2842720	Not energy per se, but it's the, it's the change from abundant energy to flat or declining that
2842720	2852560	will trigger those other, those other things. So you've got, in Europe, a real-time trial of this,
2852560	2859360	of sorts going on right now because of the Russian situation in Ukraine, in your experience in
2859360	2865680	France. What if people's response has been, especially last winter, to increasing prices
2866320	2874160	in Europe? Has it created stronger community cohesion and a return to relying on social
2874160	2879600	capital? Or has it caused more division over scarcity? Or what's been your, your kind of
2881280	2889200	trial run? Basically, in France, it has triggered very high prices of natural gas
2889200	2898400	and energy and electricity, sorry. And it has triggered significant savings by people. So they
2898400	2907840	heated less. They use less electricity. A number of companies and mostly energy-intensive industries
2907840	2916320	produce less. That's basically what happened. I have not felt a major change in social structures
2916320	2921440	or the way people behave. Actually, it has nothing to do with what happened during the COVID, for
2921440	2932560	example. Last year, nothing much happened. The political response has been significant.
2933600	2942000	And now the word sobriety is everywhere in political speeches. That is something significant.
2942720	2949760	What does the word sobriety mean? It means, actually, my own classification of energy savings
2951600	2958160	includes three, well counts three terms. The first one is efficiency. Efficiency is getting
2958160	2963600	the same service while using less energy, either to manufacture an object or to use it.
2964320	2971760	The second term that I use is sobriety, which is deliberately waiving a service of good
2972400	2979680	in order to save resources or energy. For example, I was using a car, I use a bike,
2979680	2987360	or I commute by train. This is sobriety. And poverty is exactly the same physical
2987360	2994400	item than sobriety. Only you didn't ask for it. So sobriety is having no longer
2994400	3002560	the economic means to own a car or to use it. And so you have to use a bike or to go by train.
3002560	3009200	But you didn't want it. My belief is that today what happens in France is actually poverty.
3010080	3015120	People didn't ask for it and they have to organize themselves differently.
3016080	3024720	But the government, no government can use the word poverty. So they use the word sobriety,
3025360	3032160	which is giving the impression that we do it in an organized and deliberate way.
3032640	3040640	It gives people agency to have sobriety instead of poverty. So I think the distinction between
3040640	3047520	those two is really important and clever. Do you think that individuals listening to this program
3047520	3056000	or cultures, nations, can choose sobriety before it is forced upon us as poverty?
3056720	3067440	I believe no. One of my friends with whom I work in France says you have the strategy of your sets.
3070480	3080000	So it basically goes the other way around. So my belief is that the best that you can hope
3080240	3089440	is that the day you have a shock or a crash, then you can pull out of the drawer a sobriety plan
3090480	3096560	that was framed or conceived before you had the shock or the crash. But I don't believe that
3098800	3105600	democracies will spontaneously implement a decrease of their production and their consumption.
3105600	3112160	But I do believe that they can decide to go that direction the day they realize that anyway,
3112160	3119040	they do not have the choice. Again, because that's the strategy of your set. And if I can be a little
3119040	3125920	bit rude, because I understand that I'm talking mostly to US auditors, I believe that it's going
3125920	3132720	to be even more complicated in the US, which is the land of plenty, which was built on tremendous
3132720	3140080	resources, tremendous land, and basically through getting rid of all the previous inhabitants and
3141360	3149120	animals that were there. So the country with no limits by excellence is the US.
3151200	3154480	And so it's going to be even harder in the US than it is in Europe.
3155040	3162640	Well, let me ask you about that, because Europe will arguably have to face sobriety
3162640	3169520	and poverty before the US does, because we still produce 90-some percent of our own energy.
3170320	3176560	Will that be a blessing or a curse? Will Europe have to suffer the pain first, but
3176560	3181280	they will reorganize in different ways that will ultimately be more helpful? What do you think?
3182080	3192480	I think it can be both, and history will tell. I don't know. I mean, it's a blessing in the way that
3193840	3198240	what I hope is that we use the residual fossil fuels that we have at hand
3199120	3203440	to build a world that can operate the best it can without fossil fuels.
3205280	3210560	It is not something that people understand clearly today. It is an idea which is making
3210560	3216800	its way, but slowly. And of course, I believe that in the US, you are
3217600	3221600	farther from that idea, because you still have plenty of resources.
3223920	3232800	And also, I won't, you will not learn with me that actually your country is two countries.
3234240	3237440	You have the US of the coast and the US of the middle.
3238400	3243760	And actually, it's two different countries. And the reaction to what I'm explaining right now
3244320	3252160	is totally different, whether you are talking to Massachusetts or California or Wisconsin
3253680	3261200	or Ohio. So I'm actually, again, totally aligned with you on this. I don't think we're going to
3261200	3266640	change until we're forced to. So the best thing that people listening to this and you and I are
3266640	3275600	working on is building those plans for when that moment comes. So you, among other projects,
3276960	3282400	you run the shift project, which has plans for transforming the French economy.
3282400	3286480	Can you give a brief overview of what you're doing and what your hopes are there?
3286960	3299760	Yes. That work started during the COVID. Actually, when the COVID stroke, it was clear for me
3300400	3306880	that a number of companies would ask for help. They would say, okay, we cannot operate anymore.
3306880	3310640	Give us some money or we'll have to fire, we'll go bankrupt and we'll fire everyone,
3310720	3317120	which in France is much more drama than in the US. And so I thought at the time,
3317760	3322800	one of the things that we should try to design is the counterparts that the state should ask
3322800	3328960	to these companies before lending them a helping hand. So, okay, we are going to sign the check,
3329520	3339200	but we asked you to do this and that regarding being able to operate in a world with less
3339200	3347280	fossil fuels. And then we realized pretty quickly that our work would never be ready
3348320	3353760	before the first checks would be signed. And so we said, okay, we are going to do something
3353760	3360720	slightly different. We are going to design a plan which is how we should reorganize the economy
3361680	3373440	if we want to align ourselves with a decrease of 5% premiere of the greenhouse gases emissions in the
3373440	3381520	world. And this is called the plan transformation of the economy franÃ§ais planned to transform
3381520	3387920	the French economy. And actually, it's an attempt to do economy without talking euros or dollars
3387920	3394960	at first, but we talk physical flows. So basically what we do is that we look at the physical flows
3394960	3402640	that frame the economy, the construction sector, the automotive industry, the way we grow food and
3402640	3408480	transform it, etc. And we say if we want to decrease that by 5%, sorry, if we want to decrease the
3408480	3415360	greenhouse gases emissions by 5% per year, what does it mean regarding the number of cars that
3415360	3421360	we manufacture given the energy efficiency of manufacturing one car, the number of houses that
3421360	3428800	we build, the number of people that can move around in cars and trucks, etc. And the number of
3428800	3437840	people that are employed in the different sectors. So it's planned to transform the system without
3437840	3444880	saying we should invest money here, finance such a sector with so many billion dollars here, etc.
3445600	3453520	Do not talk money at all. And it's a method in a way to address the economy as a physical system.
3454880	3461920	And we had a huge success in France, because we published a book which was called the plan
3461920	3469680	transformation of the economy franÃ§ais. And we sold over 1100,000 copies, which in France
3469680	3478000	is a huge success for a book for an essay. In order to give you a comparison, it happens that
3478000	3484400	a graphic novel that I wrote with Christophe Blain, which is called the world without end,
3484400	3492880	the Mont-Saint-FranÃ§ was in 2022, the number one book in France, the most sold book in France,
3492880	3501520	and we sold a little bit over 500,000 copies. So 100,000 copies for an essay on decarbonizing
3501520	3510400	the French economy, it's a huge success. I mean, in our wildest dreams, we wouldn't have come up
3510400	3517040	with such a figure. And plenty of top executives have read it, plenty of politicians have read it,
3518000	3526640	and I believe that we have oriented a little the debate in France on the way to decarbonize
3526640	3532160	the economy with this work and with this book. So it's a method, again, and we could apply it to
3532160	3541280	the US, exactly the same method. It's how do we orient the physical flows of economy if we want
3541360	3544640	to decrease the greenhouse gases emissions by X percent per year.
3545360	3552400	So in the global north, I suspect that the country that you live in, France,
3553280	3559280	may be closer as a culture to understanding climate energy constraints, partially due to
3559840	3563680	your book, you said 500,000 copies, partially there's this
3563760	3572400	Collapsology, you know, subculture there, French President Macron periodically voices comments
3572400	3577920	that the best times are behind us economically. You know, are these books and discussions
3578640	3584640	allowing France to be ahead of the curve, discussing limits to growth, sobriety,
3585760	3590800	and is that good or bad? What is your thought? Again, we have the strategy of our sets.
3591360	3599680	What is our sets? It's our history. For no country, we have experienced hunger,
3600480	3609680	wars, physical limits of all kinds, and so just as Great Britain, just as Scandinavian countries,
3609680	3616960	just as Switzerland. So the only countries that had an easy life in the ancient world were Italy
3616960	3625040	and Spain, which are countries today that I would say not, they are not as comfortable as
3625040	3631360	countries that are farther up north with large scale organizations designed to face a constraint.
3633440	3638560	And so it's only the result of our history. When you look at other countries in the world
3638560	3645440	that resemble us, you have Japan, a country with no resources, very strong technical culture,
3646400	3650480	and which is also very conscious of the limits of the physical limits today.
3651200	3656560	And you have, in a way, China. Same thing. I mean, China is a North country that has experienced
3656560	3664240	also hunger, wars, physical limits, and which is also a country of engineers historically.
3665040	3672320	In ancient China, the top class people were the engineers able to operate all the hydraulic system
3673120	3681600	feeding the rice paddies, well, or supplying the rice paddies. So all these countries have
3681600	3688560	things in common, which countries that have been recently occupied and which are very,
3689680	3697440	I would say, very big, vast countries with plenty of resources are not like the US,
3698080	3704480	like Brazil, like Canada, in a way like Russia, what we could call anti-countries,
3704480	3710000	while these countries are not so comfortable with global physical limits.
3710800	3716880	So in preparing for this interview, Jean-Marc, I was reading about you yesterday,
3718080	3725360	and you are increasingly being called a guru and a most influential public intellectual
3725440	3733200	in French media. I'm just curious, how are you navigating, describing,
3733200	3741840	our extremely challenging biophysical reality in a political system that in France and globally
3741840	3750880	rewards simplicity and feel-good messaging, where your message is counter to that? How are you finding
3750880	3758320	that? What has changed the relationship between an individual and the population today is social
3758320	3765600	networks. My faith would probably have been very different in a world with only media,
3766800	3774720	because I would have, in that world, without pleasing the journalist, nobody would have heard of me.
3775760	3779840	In the modern world, with the social media, you can put online videos, you can put online
3780080	3788320	long videos or conferences, you can put online explanations, I used to maintain now, it's a
3788320	3798560	bit old-fashioned, a website to vulgarize energy and climate change issues. And the reason why
3799200	3805840	the graphic novel that I mentioned before was a success is that before that, the online videos
3805840	3812080	of the course that I teach at Mint Paris was already a success. And the reason why is that,
3812080	3820480	well, success by French figures. I think I went up to one million views or something like that.
3821760	3829440	And it was a success because people appreciate consistency. Actually, I believe that the reason
3829440	3837600	why I have had a small success is that I offered to a number of people that were
3838800	3845040	vaguely conscious of something, but couldn't put a name on it, all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle
3845840	3852400	that they can assemble and get a clear picture of. So I provide them with some kind of comfort
3853120	3856400	of not being so stupid because they felt that something was
3858240	3864320	not corresponding to the explanations they got elsewhere, basically. And
3866640	3872160	the fact that I have a base in a way that I can address directly through social media,
3873600	3882000	like for example today, I write a daily post on LinkedIn, I publish videos online once in a while,
3882080	3890000	et cetera, makes it so that my reputation cannot be made only by the media.
3892320	3900400	Whereas in the past, you were fully dependent on what the media said of you for your reputation.
3900400	3909360	Now it's a little bit different. So the relationship that I have with the press
3910080	3920560	is, I would say, in between a distant relationship. Whenever I get an invitation,
3920560	3924640	I don't say yes all the time. Actually, I say yes one time out of 10 maybe.
3926640	3933840	And I don't feel like I desperately need them. And actually, my day-to-day job doesn't evolve
3934160	3940800	me. My day-to-day job is to run a company and to chair an NGO. It has nothing to do with the media.
3944400	3950960	So when I'm labeled a guru of whatever, the best thing that I can do is not respond.
3951840	3963280	It's not responding. And if some people mention it to me, then I answer saying what I think of it.
3964640	3974960	Well, I think people not only value consistency, but they value truth and authenticity. And I suspect,
3975040	3983680	I don't know, but I suspect as events get closer, as we have more expensive and less available energy,
3983680	3991200	that the conventional media will not be able to tell the full biophysical truth that you and I are
3991200	4000800	telling. It's just too threatening to the general public. So the role that you and others are playing
4000800	4008720	is very interesting in informing and hopefully inspiring society towards change. Do you agree?
4009520	4020640	Partially only because I think that what the press can do is describe simultaneously
4020640	4029680	a problem and the way to react to the problem. Just saying over and over and over that there is a
4029680	4036560	problem is something indeed that they don't appreciate much. And actually, when you look at
4036560	4044480	the way the vulgarized climate change, they have selected information which is distant in space
4044480	4052240	and in time. Basically, the information that they like the most is what will happen in 2100
4053120	4060560	and the global temperature increase. So this is distant in time, 2100, and it is distant in
4060560	4065040	space because it's a global temperature and you don't feel a global temperature and I don't feel
4065040	4070000	a global temperature. I mean, I feel the temperature which is right now in the room where I am and you
4070000	4074960	feel the temperature which is right now in the room where you are. And neither of us feels the
4075040	4083360	average temperature. It doesn't exist for our senses. But what the media don't speak of much,
4083360	4087760	and there was an article published also in the scientific literature pointing that
4088640	4096720	a couple of months ago, there very much relay information that pertains to things that are
4096720	4103520	not so distant in the future and pretty local. Like for example, what will be the flow of the
4103520	4109920	color of the river in tenures and the consequences that it can have on crops. That is something
4109920	4118400	that they do not give much audience to this kind of scientific work, even though you have plenty
4118400	4129680	of scientific publications that pertain to this kind of issue. So what they like again, the media
4129680	4135760	is talking of an issue when you have the beginning of a solution or the beginning of a way to react
4135760	4142640	or to act facing the issue. And this is why I've set up the SHIFT project. The SHIFT project is
4142640	4150400	actually fully devoted to proposing ways to confront the issue and to react to the issue
4150400	4157840	and to organize ourselves with the issue. So it also tries to provide hope in a way.
4158080	4165440	And then you can get more audience on both the issue and the way to react to the issue.
4165440	4172240	The leading economic paper in France, which is called MESICO, gives much more audience
4172240	4179120	to environmental issues now than it did just two years ago. But the reason why is that they
4179120	4186640	right now also have many stories to tell regarding companies or action which is being taken
4186880	4194160	to face the issue. So that's the reason why. And do I believe that France is at the forefront?
4195360	4204160	I would say in a bunch which is globally very late, the answer is yes. So what I believe is that
4204960	4212400	in a collection of countries that are globally extremely late, France is a little bit less late
4212400	4218880	than the others. We have done a number of things that were done for the first time.
4220160	4225840	Well, I mean, you and I have been telling variations of this story publicly for 20 years.
4225840	4233680	And I feel that the world events have caught up to the story that we're telling. What's your
4233680	4239680	experience? Are people obviously because of your popularity, people are now more receptive to this?
4240320	4245440	I believe it goes the other way around. I believe I am popular because people realized.
4250320	4257520	People realized. I'm surfing on the wave. Yes, because we have heat waves, because we have
4258160	4264480	prices of gasoline going up and down and up very often. Because we have, I mean, yes.
4265280	4272240	Yeah. Because people realized. So, and for example, let me take another example,
4273120	4281920	which is the opinion that French have on nuclear energy. It gained recently 20 percentage points
4283520	4289280	in support. So about 50% of the French population supported nuclear energy two years ago.
4290240	4298080	One third were against and 15% said they had no opinion. It jumped from 50 to 70% in two years.
4298960	4305040	So you could say, okay, that's chocolate, this is false. But actually, it evolved exactly the
4305040	4309920	same way in all other European countries. Well, that could be because of Russia and Ukraine.
4309920	4318240	Even in Germany, whatever, even in Germany, it gained 15 percentage points of support.
4318320	4322080	And I am sure of one thing that in Germany, people have never heard of me.
4322880	4327200	And in Finland, people have never heard of me. And in Spain, people have never heard of me.
4328880	4335600	So I think we should put it the other way around. First, people realized. And then
4338000	4344240	well, the people that said, I can explain you why become popular.
4345200	4351760	So I have some closing questions that I ask all my guests. I have so much more I want to talk to
4351760	4358720	you about. But before I get to those questions, let me just ask you one one final content question.
4359760	4366080	What the hell are we going to do? What should we do facing this as nations?
4367040	4369280	You're on the spot, Jean-Marc. Go for it.
4372720	4379200	As nations, we will do what our populations ask for, as long as we are democracies.
4379920	4385200	Which is why at the SHIFT project, we never considered that we should address first and
4385200	4392000	foremost politicians. But we believe that we should address first and foremost the civil society.
4392640	4399200	So the people that we're interested to deal with are people who are deciding in the economic sector,
4399760	4407200	are deciding as civil servants, are deciding as academics. So people that frame our collective
4407200	4415280	knowledge and people that are deciding in the NGO sector. So this is our primary audience.
4416000	4421440	The people that we want to talk to is the civil society. And we believe that the day
4421440	4427920	we are able to convince a sufficient fraction of that civil society, that it goes up because
4427920	4434640	democracies are systems that go up. And the elected people have to take that into account
4434640	4441440	in a way or another. And I never believe that we should talk to politicians first. And actually,
4441440	4446560	I'm not especially eager to talk to them. I mean, once in a while, I've got an invitation
4446560	4453360	from a minister or whatever, so I'm polite. I go to it. But I don't hope much for it. And what
4454800	4459520	my real, the audience that I'm really interested in is the civil society.
4460080	4464320	So we need to shift society before the politicians. Yeah.
4464320	4473920	Yes. Exactly. You have a president elected because you have people voting for him, basically.
4477280	4487280	And a significant fraction of the civil society in France still, I'm not knowing the word inappropriate,
4487280	4494240	but escapes our influence. All the people that vote for the populist parties.
4496640	4502320	Basically, we are not able to talk to them today, which is an issue, which is a big issue. I mean,
4502320	4506320	we have to talk to these people and I still haven't found a way to do so.
4508640	4514240	Because these people actually are the first losers of the energy contraction. They don't
4514240	4521840	realize it, but they are the first. So we have to talk to them and we have to embark them on the
4522800	4532400	on the plan that we believe is, I would say, response correctly to the situation.
4534000	4541280	And I don't see that at my age, there is much more that I can do than going on,
4542320	4546480	doing what I've already done, which is working with companies at carbon four,
4547040	4551760	working with the civil society and the ship project and writing books.
4554240	4559360	Which, and as you may know, the Le Monde Saint-FranÃ§ois is going to be released in the U.S.
4560080	4565920	We are currently working right now with my co-author on the U.S. version, because we have to
4567040	4572720	move from meters to feet, square meters to square feet.
4573440	4582480	And we have to change all the examples that pertain to France into examples that pertain to the U.S.
4583360	4584800	And when will that be out?
4586800	4592480	It should be released at the end of the year, if we're lucky. So end of the year or beginning
4592480	4597520	of next year, if we take too long in finishing the adaptation.
4598000	4606240	So the ultimate plan, then, is to combine efficiency and sobriety at multiple scales
4606240	4614240	in society to avert collapse and avert just abject poverty, some combination at institutional
4614240	4620400	government and individual levels. Yes? Yes. Basically, you've summarized it correctly.
4620960	4627600	Excellent. I'm looking forward to getting your book. Let me ask you a few closing
4627600	4635040	questions, Jean-Marc, that I ask all my guests. We've talked about nations, etc.
4635600	4641760	What personal advice do you have to people watching this video, listening to this show,
4641760	4644640	at this time of global metacrisis?
4644880	4651680	I would say I have two. The first one is devote time to understand what's going on,
4653280	4660000	because basically, the solid conclusions that you get to is always the conclusions that you
4660000	4670400	have come to by yourself. We are, I mean, human nature is such that we don't like that much
4670400	4679680	conclusions that we're afraid by others. We lack our own. So take time, dig into the issue, read,
4679680	4685520	listen to people, watch conferences, whatever, read scientific literature if you can do it.
4686640	4692320	Otherwise, watch videos of people that are good at verbalizing the issue.
4693280	4702880	The second thing is do not stay alone, because it's an issue which is easy to become anxious
4704000	4712560	when you realize the magnitude of the issue. One of the things that we don't like is to
4713520	4718320	pull ourselves out of a group, because we have understood something that the rest of the group
4718320	4727600	hasn't understood. We will never do that to take action. The only action that we're able to take,
4727600	4732320	at least in Europe, maybe in the US, it's a little bit different, is collective action,
4732880	4739840	which is why it's easier to do something in the frame of a job, in the professional world,
4739840	4746800	it's easier to do something, because it can be collective action. We need to still have
4747360	4754560	social relationships. We still need to have a couple friends, kids, relatives, whatever,
4756080	4762080	and so moving forward is something which is much easier to do when you belong to a group.
4762640	4767600	Is there a way that the 500,000 people that bought your book or the 100,000 people that
4767600	4775120	bought your transformation essay or that follow your LinkedIn can connect and actually meet and
4775120	4783600	talk to each other in France, like Discord? There is a sister association of the SHIFT project,
4784240	4790480	which is called the SHIFTERS, which is the association of all the people that want to
4790480	4798480	give a helping hand to the work of the SHIFT project. Actually, this association today has
4799120	4807760	around 20,000 members, a small number of them being in foreign countries,
4810160	4815840	of course, but by and large, the two first foreign countries are Belgium and Switzerland,
4815840	4823120	because it's French-speaking countries, but we have a group in the UK, and we probably have a
4823120	4833120	small group in the US. This association is very well structured. It's structured as a company,
4833760	4841520	because most people that belong to that association come from the professional world,
4841520	4846800	and so they have organized the association basically as a company. So it's very well
4846800	4854880	structured. Yes, we have that. How would you change your answer about those two bits of advice
4854880	4860560	if you were talking to young humans in France or in the United States or anywhere in the world?
4861280	4868000	16, 18, 20 years old who are learning about climate change and that energy availability might be
4868720	4874720	in oil, half of what it is 30 years from now. What sort of recommendations would you give to
4874720	4883360	young people? Actually, the youngest people that I often talk to are students,
4884320	4889440	so I do not talk to people, I do not very often talk to people that are still in high school
4889440	4903520	or primary school, but I would say that probably my first advice is to be reasonably good
4905600	4913280	in science, which is the way to connect to the physical world and the way to understand
4913280	4924000	how things work, how the world works, where to listen at weak signals, to look at weak
4924000	4931040	signals before they become of first magnitude. So probably that the best advice that I would give
4931040	4948000	to young people would be to try to be good in science at large, which is again connecting
4948000	4955600	with the physical world. If you could wave a magic wand and there was no personal recourse to your
4955600	4961920	decision, what is one thing you would do to improve human and planetary futures?
4964400	4965280	Surprise greed?
4968080	4970720	That would require a magic wand, I think.
4975920	4979920	Including for me, including for you, including for everyone, I mean it's one of the things that
4980000	4985520	gives us, is that desire to have always more?
4990560	4998080	Well, energy surplus has certainly turbocharged that in humans. I think without as much energy
4998080	5006240	surplus, there was no possibility of having more all the time, so that is one of the things that
5006320	5012160	scares me the most is the concept of loss aversion because we are the richest generation ever to
5012160	5020560	live of humans on this planet and we would be happy with half what we have, but getting from
5020560	5027840	here to there is going to be a doozy because of our psychological expectations are not that as a
5027840	5036640	culture. Yes, I agree with that. Yeah, so this has been a great first overview of your work. I
5036640	5043680	know you are a nuclear, a world expert on nuclear energy and we didn't really have time to dive into
5043680	5050800	that. If you were to come back on the program six months from now, what is one particular issue
5050800	5055600	that you are passionate about that's relevant to our future that we could take a deep dive on?
5055600	5063440	Do you have any speculation? I don't think that all the technological debates,
5064960	5072320	be it on nuclear energy or wind energy or hydrogen or etc., is a fundamental debate.
5072960	5079200	Basically, the fundamental debate is on cultural issues, just the one that we stated.
5079600	5090240	We will succeed one day in putting ethics above our greed, for example, we will succeed.
5092400	5097200	It seems to me that this debate is much more fundamental even though I've been
5097200	5103840	trained as an engineer and for a very, very long time I was convinced that the future was in technical
5103840	5121600	fixes. Well, now I believe that actually it's in the way we accept to change our cultural references,
5121600	5129600	which is much harder actually. It's much easier to build a nuclear reactor than changing our minds.
5130240	5137760	Yeah, the next tech is maybe inner tech, the tech in our minds on how we experience the world
5137760	5144480	and how we can get most of the things we really want without using a lot of energy and materials.
5144480	5150240	At least that's my hope. This has been great. It was so nice to meet you and like I said,
5150240	5156320	it feels like we're on parallel paths and different parts of the world and if I can help you in your
5156320	5163120	work, let me know and I will definitely get your book when it comes to the United States and we'll
5163120	5169760	put all the show notes on this episode of your references and such. Thank you very much.
