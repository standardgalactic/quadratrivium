0	6720	Bienvenue. My name is Nate Higgins. I am the director of the United States
6720	13360	Nonprofit Energy in Our Future. I am also the host of the podcast, The Great
13360	19040	Simplification. Yesterday, upon the invitation of my colleague in Canada,
19040	26740	Kira Cooper, I gave a presentation to the Environmental Studies Association of
26740	33500	Canada to the Academic Congress of Canada 2024, which next week will be viewed by
33500	42880	some 10,000 to 15,000 professors and affiliates of universities. Kira was
42880	48720	gracious in allowing me to speak as long as I wanted to. So of all the
48720	53300	presentations I've done, this is the most comprehensive, most up-to-date. I forgot
53300	57500	a few things. I'm sure I'm missing some things. The world is changing. I'm still
57500	61900	learning. But if you're looking for one-stop-shop, it's about an hour and
61900	68980	45-minute talk. There's a brief intro by Kira, followed by a part one, the drivers
68980	74260	and constraints of our situation, the implications and scenarios followed by a
74260	82260	multiple-scale portfolio of potential responses by us. It is my hope that many
82420	87340	professors around the world start to integrate this system science of our
87340	92860	human predicament instead of continuing to work in silos. We need the silos, but
92860	98580	as part of a larger collective of information and cross-disciplinary
98580	105220	sharing, I hope you learn from this presentation and share it. It will take a
105220	112660	village. Here's Kira Abiento. Greetings et bienvenue au congrès 2024. Au nom de
112660	117260	l'Association canadienne d'études environnementales et de nos partenaires, j'ai le
117260	122700	grand honor de vous présenter Dr. Nate Higgins. Nate est le directeur de l'Institut
122700	126660	for the Study of Energy and our Future et haute to podcast the great
126660	131980	simplification. Welcome. My name is Kira Cooper and I'm the co-president of the
131980	136060	Environmental Studies Association of Canada. I wish to acknowledge that today
136060	140620	I'm speaking to you from the traditional territory of the Haudenosaunee, Anishinaabe
140620	145100	and Neutral Peoples. I would also like to recognize the immense natural resources,
145100	149620	energy and human capital that make it possible for us to be here on this call.
149620	154860	On behalf of ESAC and our partners, I am honored to welcome Dr. Nate Higgins as
154860	160260	our 2024 Congress keynote speaker. Nate is the co-founder and director of the
160300	164420	Institute for the Study of Energy and our Future and host of the great
164420	169020	simplification podcast. He is a highly respected and widely trusted thought
169020	173940	leader and communicator extraordinaire at the nexus of energy, environment and
173940	179300	finance. I am thrilled to have Nate join us as we discuss what sustaining shared
179300	183940	futures means in these critical times. Without further ado, bienvenue and
183940	190220	welcome, Nate. Merci beaucoup, Kira. Thank you for the nice introduction. This
190260	194140	will be the longest presentation I've ever given in my life. This is a
194140	200460	culmination of 20 years of research on multiple disciplines. I know most of you
200460	205500	are scientists and academics and probably haven't heard some of this. Some of
205500	210300	this can be a little bit hard hitting. There will be references on every page
210300	214940	of my slides. You can watch the video later and research things. And Kira,
214940	220060	I'll offer now since we'll be on a tight timeline. I know we'll have time for
220060	225540	a few questions, but if you wanted to reconvene another time for your
225540	229380	colleagues in Canada to have a conversation and questions, I'd be happy
229380	234460	to do that. So I'm going to speak fast. There's a lot of slides. We are part of
234460	240180	a systems story. If you are a member of our species, which if you're watching
240180	245060	this, you are. In the 300,000 years we've been a species, there's about an eight
245060	250020	to 10% chance that if you're human, you're alive right now. And we've arrived
250020	255140	at a species level conversation, which is what I'm going to discuss today. I'm
255140	258380	going to have five sections, a brief introduction. I'm going to describe the
258380	263980	human ecosystem, the super organism implications and scenarios for the
263980	268980	future. And then I've got quite a long what to do section. This isn't a
268980	275140	prescriptive talk, but I can give ideas for direction for the world, for
275180	281500	Canada, for civil society, for the Academy and for you as individual humans.
281820	287020	Okay, a brief introduction. So those of you watching this, since this is a
287020	295740	scientist plenary, you have different priorities. You also want to contribute
295740	299660	to better futures for humanity. And you want to live a good life. I couldn't
299660	306100	find a transparent image of a toke here. I'm going to focus on your research
306100	310860	hat a little bit and make you think about what we need to be researching and
310860	314540	the role of the Academy in the future. And I'll come back to that at the
314540	319060	conclusion. We hear a lot of stories in the news about what's going right and
319060	323900	what's going wrong with the world. And I won't spend bandwidth here. But in
323900	329380	order to diagnose the patient and figure out what to do, we first have to
329420	334980	understand actually what's wrong and the drivers and the constraints of what we
334980	339380	face. And that's what this talk is going to be about. The two predominant
339380	344500	cultural narratives, at least in North America, are a green new deal. We migrate
344500	350500	our energy systems to 100% renewables, work towards net zero emissions, and
350500	354220	everything will be fine. There's also business as usual. There's nothing wrong
354220	357460	with our past model. There's no shortages for anything we need to
357460	364860	deregulate and reduce taxes. This story is going to tell a wider and deeper
365220	372380	history and explanation of our human predicament. From a siloed perspective,
372380	376700	there's lots of important aspects to a more sustainable future, renewable
376700	381140	energy. There's a lot of experts on that. But if we take an aerial view, we can
381140	387100	see that we have islands of expertise in our world that rarely talk to each
387100	394740	other. And that ends up meaning that we have lots of concurrent, urgent and
394780	400980	eloquent and erudite conversations that lack the aerial view that look at how
400980	404860	things are connected. We have islands of expertise in our cultural
404860	411900	conversations separated by oceans of incoherence. Okay, so how do we make
411900	417340	sense of things and put them together? The human ecosystem. I'm going to go
417340	424140	over this in several slides. We take energy, invent things, combine it with
424140	429660	materials, develop products, represent these in our economic system by
429660	436500	dollars, Canadian or US or others. And we do this all to generate the same
436500	441180	emotional states of our ancestors and the whole thing creates pollution. I'm
441180	447260	going to first talk about the biophysical side of this. So energy is vital in
447260	453580	nature. Nothing in nature moves without energy and energy is also vital in human
453580	459620	systems. Every single good or service in our global economic system that results
459620	466540	in economic growth requires energy to invent, to mine, to create, to manufacture,
466580	472100	to package, to deliver, to maintain, to repair, to run, to dispose of. There is
472100	478580	not a single thing that contributes to GDP that doesn't require energy. I don't
478580	483100	know about Canada, but in the United States, the average household has over 60
483100	488660	devices plugged in all the time, even if they're not running. And we take this
488660	494820	for granted. We don't see the sea of energy that we are swimming in. This is a
494820	501100	picture of me on my farm here in Wisconsin. That's a picture of my horse who
501100	506260	does the work of about one horse, which is 10 times more work than I can do.
506700	510980	That's my utility vehicle with a little bit of gasoline can do the work of 45
510980	516180	horses. And that's my truck with some diesel fuel can do the work of 300
516300	522980	horses. The next time you're taking a flight to Toronto or Vancouver, imagine
522980	530180	100,000 horses invisibly pulling that jet across the sky. This is the power and
530180	536460	the benefit that we get from this ancient carbon, which is oil. One barrel of
536460	543460	oil has 5.7 million British thermal units worth of energy, which equates to
543460	549820	around 1700 kilowatt hours worth of work potential compared to about 0.6
549820	555500	kilowatt hours in human daily work output. And after you do the math, that's
555500	560620	around four and a half years of physical human labor is in every barrel of oil.
561180	568420	We use in the global economy about 100 million barrel of oil equivalents of coal
568420	574220	oil and natural gas every year, which means we effectively have armies of
574220	580660	fossil helpers to the tune of 400 or 500 billion human equivalents compared to
580660	588220	around 4 to 5 billion actual human workers. So what this has done is underpin the
588220	593100	story of industrialization, where humans have replaced things we used to do
593100	599020	manually or with draft horses by adding machines. And those machines and various
599020	605380	technologies are all powered by energy, mostly fossil energy. And what this has
605380	611260	done is raised our profits and our incomes and the size of the human
611260	616140	enterprise. Here's an example of something in Wisconsin. We still are the dairy
616140	623460	state. We have cows. The benefits that we get massively increase our profits and
623460	629820	our wages. A person milking a cow spends around 30 minutes manually and makes
629820	635500	around $5 an hour. If you add an automated system, you're adding 180 times
635500	641100	more energy with the technology, but you're boosting the profits or the wages by
641100	647420	almost four times to $20 per hour. Then you can even take it further and add a
647420	652060	fully automated milking machine, which is 400 times more energy than an
652100	658220	individual human. And that boosts the profit to around $25 an hour. What's
658220	665100	really important and one of the key takeaways from this presentation is as
665100	672860	energy prices increase, very energy heavy processes like aircraft or aluminum
672860	678780	smelting, many mining things, not only become less profitable, but become
678820	685860	unprofitable. The left panel here, the blue, orange and gray are what happens to
685860	691700	the hand milking if prices increase, nothing. The middle example shows if
691700	697100	prices go from five cents in blue to 10 cents in orange to 15 cents a kilowatt
697100	703180	hour in gray, there's a reduction in the profits. But as you'll see in the right
703180	708300	panel here and a doubling of energy prices from five cents to 10 cents,
708340	715060	there's a massive drop in the heavy industry processes. And if we triple,
715060	719940	we're now operating at a loss. And this was started to see last year because of
719940	725300	the Ukraine war in Europe as natural gas prices spiked. Our economies are
725300	730460	incredibly sensitive to increases in the main input to our current global
730460	735020	enterprise, which is energy. So because of this industrialization, we have
735020	740700	higher wages, higher profits, lower price stuff, and economic growth for more
740700	745820	people. We actually do have more people. In the last few hundred years, we've
745820	751580	gone from a billion people to eight billion people alive today. But even more
751580	757420	dramatic is the goods and services available per person. The average human
757420	762940	today is 14 times materially wealthier than the average person 200 years ago.
763180	767460	And the average person in the United States is 50 times as wealthy as the
767460	772340	average human was 200 years ago. This doesn't account for inequalities and
772340	778420	such. This is just geometric arithmetic average. If you combine these two
778420	783300	stats, the human economy measured by the number of people times the average
783540	788980	goods and service consumption of those people is a thousand times bigger than
788980	795540	it was in the year 1500. But in our economic schools, our business schools
795580	801540	at McGill University, we don't teach that energy is important. We teach that
801580	809780	energy is its cost share of an input to a process. So $1,000 worth of oil is
809820	815660	equal to our economy as $1,000 worth of pencils or bike helmets or water bottles
815660	821300	or cupcakes. So in effect, our culture has become energy blind. This is a
821300	826380	circular economy graph that's shown in beginnings, econ 101 classes that show
826380	832420	that people demand things, corporations and the market produce the things. And
832420	838020	there's this virtuous cycle. And that's how the economy goes forward. This
838020	842620	cycle neglects the source of the majority of the inputs, which is the
843220	849580	non-renewable energy and materials. And it neglects the sink, which is the carbon
849780	855660	and other waste capacities of our planet. So our current economic system conflates
855660	861140	the dollar value of energy with the work value. And we largely don't include the
861140	867820	cost of pollution at all. We are energy blind. And if you look at what we are
867820	874260	doing, we are drawing down ancient carbon millions of times faster than it was
874260	879980	geologically sequestered and trickle charged by the son of ancient phytoplankton
879980	885860	and algae and diatoms. So we are alive during what one day may be referred to
885860	891100	as the carbon pulse. And we have 300,000 year history as a species and it might
891100	896660	look like this. Zooming in on a 20,000 year horizon, the carbon pulse might
896660	901300	look like this of all the coal, oil and natural gas stacked on top of each other.
901900	907620	Out of 1000 year period, it might look like this. And we are near the top of
907620	912580	this carbon pulse. We're somewhere between the yellow star and the red star.
912860	917700	Because energy is so important and vital from an economic perspective, we hope
917700	922340	we're near the white, the yellow star, because that means we have more decades
922340	927940	ahead of this cheap fossil armies to support our technology and consumption.
928300	931980	From a biosphere climate, which I'm going to talk about a little later
931980	936300	standpoint, we hope we're at the red star because we've been emitting this
937020	942660	this warming effect, a thermal blanket from adding this ancient carbon so fast
942660	948020	to the atmosphere that we don't want to continue to do that. But this carbon
948020	955220	that we've taken for granted is finite. We take out the best first, then we get
955220	961060	complicated tools to get more. But it is finite and depleting quite rapidly.
961100	967340	The graph on the left shows a story of humans overcoming energy depletion
967340	972540	with technology. The United States peaked in oil production in 1970, decline,
972860	978220	decline for 40 years, and then we discovered how to frack and technology
978220	984780	overcame depletion. Well, a different story is using the exact same data and
984820	990180	charts, but broken out by geological province. The green shows the lower
990460	996660	48 states, the conventional oil. The orange shows Alaska, which is separated
996660	1002340	from the United States by Canada. It's not even a contiguous part of our
1002340	1007020	country. The blue is offshore oil. It's not on the land. It's underneath the
1007020	1013260	Gulf of Mexico. And this red is what has been fracked, the light tight oil.
1013700	1018180	The light tight oil depletes at 80% in the first 18 months, and you have to
1018260	1024460	continue to drill to find more. And there's nothing left after the tight
1024460	1028940	oil. This is the source rock for where all the other oil originated.
1029660	1035740	And what ends up happening is, I'll go through this really quickly, the gray
1035740	1042460	here shows the decline rate of all the oil wells drilled in the United
1042460	1047540	States before 2014. The orange shows the decline rate, and it's a little bit
1047540	1055140	steeper for 2014, all the way up to 2019 in the red. And you can see every year
1055140	1058900	we add more and more wells, and the United States has drilled more wells
1058900	1063540	than the rest of the world combined, and the decline rate becomes steeper. So
1063540	1069660	we are having to run faster and faster in place just to stay in place. So what
1069660	1076820	ends up happening is technology, in the case of shale oil, acts as a larger
1076820	1081540	straw. Largely the same amount of original oil is there, but we're just
1081540	1086420	getting it out faster and becoming that much closer to the slurping sound,
1086540	1090940	which we hear at the end of the milkshake. Yes, new technology does
1090980	1095940	access some resources that we wouldn't have been able to, but largely it just
1095940	1100620	takes things out faster than we would have got without technology. What
1100620	1105980	about so-called renewable energy? So one of the important concepts of energy
1105980	1112900	blindness is the fact that all energy is not fungible. It's not equal. It's not
1112900	1117340	interchangeable. So here are a few points on renewable energy. First of all,
1117340	1124460	renewable energy isn't. It's a meme. Renewable energy is rebuildable. Oak
1124460	1130620	tree is renewable. A chicken is renewable. As long as we find an acorn or a male
1130620	1135900	and female chicken to make an egg, they are renewable. Wind turbines, solar
1135900	1142820	panels, etc. are complicated machinery with polysilicon and a global supply
1142820	1147260	chain. They are no more renewable than a pickup truck. The sun and the wind are
1147260	1152140	renewable, but the devices we use to make them are not. Another point is renewable
1152140	1156980	energy produces electricity, but only 20% of global energy use at the present
1156980	1160820	moment is electric. There are lots of things that because of the energy
1160820	1165940	density don't run on electricity. They could in the future, but only at a much
1165940	1170540	higher cost. And I showed you early the impact of profits and viability from a
1170540	1179380	higher cost. There is also all of our plans for a techno utopia future kind
1179380	1184460	of wave away the fact that we've been growing, growing, growing our energy every
1184460	1188500	single year with the exception of recessions for the last 100 years. This
1188500	1193100	at some point in the near future will change. And what will renewable energy
1193100	1199260	and other technology do on the downslope of the carbon pulse? Once these 500
1199260	1206020	billion fossil workers start to retire. Also higher full system cost means lower
1206020	1211060	economic benefits. As I said before, there's a difference between a technology
1211060	1217300	being viable and being affordable and scalable. Also, there are around 6000
1217300	1223420	other products that are generated from oil and natural gas. And, you know, we
1223420	1228900	have asphalt and plastic and medicines and tires and all kinds of medical
1228900	1234300	devices, etc. These all come from oil. So if we stopped using oil, we would need
1234300	1240140	to find alternatives for many of these 6000 inputs that are byproducts of our
1240140	1246620	current barrel of oil. So far, the energy transition has not been. It's been more
1246620	1253300	of an energy addition. If you look at the last 200 years of human energy use, the
1253300	1258980	green is biomass, the brown is coal, the black is oil, the dark blue is gas,
1259020	1265020	nuclear, etc. Solar and wind end up being about two and a half percent of final
1265020	1269540	consumption. They are growing quite rapidly, but in an absolute and they're
1269580	1275460	growing faster than fossil fuels. But on an absolute basis, globally fossil
1275460	1280220	fuels are still growing. They've grown 55 percent in the last 15 years. So far,
1280220	1284900	there has not been a green revolution, only a green addition. And by the way,
1284900	1292300	we are now using more biomass shown in green here than we were in the year 1850,
1292300	1298860	which was before we started using fossil fuels. Lastly, it is true that
1298860	1306460	renewable energy is much more efficient than coal or oil in various processes.
1306780	1313300	However, society doesn't maximize energy use or maximize efficiency. We
1313300	1319580	maximize power, which is energy use per unit time that creates work. This is
1319580	1323900	called the fourth law of thermodynamics, which is the maximum power principle,
1324220	1329740	which is we operate in nature at intermediate states between efficiency
1329780	1334780	and full resource use. And usually that's at an intermediate state. And the
1334780	1340900	implications for this is that this is an average load at three different times
1340900	1347740	during the year. This is what our societal demands require. And this is what
1347740	1351340	we work during the day and there's a spike and then we go to sleep at night,
1351340	1355780	but we still have a lot of baseline things that are going. But society
1355780	1361540	cares about creating this graph. And the best thing for that is potential
1361540	1365580	energy that is stored that we can burn at a flick of a switch and meet these
1365580	1371540	demand curves. We can use solar and wind better than we are doing now, but
1371540	1376380	it's going to look like a much different society. Okay, briefly on materials,
1376820	1385500	energy and GDP are 99% correlated globally. Materials and GDP are 100%
1385500	1391300	correlated. So if you look at the red line here is global GDP. The purple line
1391300	1395580	is the material footprint, which is a composite of energy and materials. And
1395580	1399780	you can see they're incredibly tightly linked. We are growing renewable
1399780	1403900	energy faster than we're growing fossil fuels, which is why the global CO2
1403940	1410340	continues to increase, but increases at a lower rate than energy and GDP, but
1410340	1416100	they're very tightly linked. The problem is, is as we decarbonize, we're going
1416100	1423380	to have to rematerialize because renewable energy is very copper, metal,
1423580	1429940	rare earth dependent. Another issue is much of these materials like cobalt
1429940	1434020	and nickel and lithium and copper are found in countries that are in the
1434020	1438820	global south. They are poorer material countries. They already have civil
1438940	1443580	strife and they're going to be experiencing higher wet bulb temperatures
1443860	1449500	and chaos and uncertainty from a warming climate. This is a real problem for
1449500	1456980	the scaling of the current net zero EV plans. This graph shows the blue lines
1456980	1462500	are the production of the country of Chile of copper and the red line are the
1462500	1469980	consumption of energy. In the United States, we used to have 20% ore grade in
1469980	1476860	the 19th century that went down to 2% ore grade and now is two tenths of 1%. So
1476860	1481700	we have to get more and more rock and overburden to get the same amount of
1481700	1487940	copper. The point here is that even in materials and in every aspect of society,
1487980	1492300	everything we do will become more expensive if we can't reduce the energy
1492300	1497020	consumption of various processes faster than energy prices grow. Okay, what
1497020	1501980	about technology? How does technology fit into this? Well, every unit of GDP has
1501980	1507740	three things in common, energy, materials and information or the technology.
1508060	1514220	There are no exceptions. So there are two types of technology. The first type is
1514260	1522180	ways to make energy use more efficient or a new energy technology like a better
1522180	1530500	solar panel. The other type of technology type two is creating devices that replace
1530500	1536540	what humans used to do manually or new inventions that our prior ancestors never
1536540	1541620	had access to. The vast majority of technology in our world today is of this
1541620	1547140	type two, which ends up increasing the baseline for more energy requirement the
1547140	1555780	following year. So this graph shows that humans get better at inventions and we
1555780	1562140	get more efficient in our energy use over time, around 1.2% a year more
1562140	1567100	efficient over the last 200 years. However, during that same time, this is
1567100	1575220	another color chart showing the energy stack of various energies over the last
1575220	1581820	200 years. We continue to grow our total energy. In fact, energy efficiency has
1581820	1588820	increased 36% in the last 35 years. But during that time, our energy consumption
1589060	1595380	has increased 63%. This is called the rebound effect or Jevons paradox that as
1595380	1600340	we make more profits because we got more efficient, we funnel those profits back
1600340	1606420	into economic growth, which is a draw on energy. What about money? Money is what
1606420	1611540	makes the world go round, right? Well, money is actually a claim on energy. When
1611620	1619020	you spend your loony at Tim Hortons or any other thing in our daily lives, every
1619020	1625140	time we spend something, it's a call on energy. Economic textbooks tell us that
1625140	1631780	money is lent out from existing capital at banks. This is incorrect. The reality is
1631780	1637140	is that the vast majority of money is lent into existence. Banks don't lend
1637140	1643020	money. They create it. And when they create it, the financial system is in
1643020	1648020	balance. There's the same amount of assets and liabilities. But the bio
1648020	1653580	physical world is not because when 10 million Canadian dollars come into the
1653580	1659460	system from a bank, the same amount of timber or moose or copper or dolphins or
1659460	1667340	trees exist. So here's a conceptual showing from time from left to right
1667700	1674300	that we had sustainable flows of the biogeochemical use of nature, the soil,
1674300	1681300	the sun and the wind. And in around the 1700s, we hit a capacity on that. There's
1681300	1686580	a different sort of curve, which is a Gaussian or normal curve, which is for
1686620	1691620	finite resources. And we started to access things like oil and copper and
1691620	1695620	coal. These were buried underground, but they're finite. And we started to add
1695620	1699900	them to our economic system. But there will be a peak and a decline of these
1699900	1705540	like their will on the carbon pulse. Overlaid on all that is a monetary thing,
1705540	1710540	which is a cultural creation by our species that we create monetary markers
1710540	1715780	for all this stuff. And if you put all these three things together, they create
1715780	1720220	this little graphic. And with access to these, this ancient sunlight, which is
1720460	1725620	indistinguishable from magic on human time scales, our economic system grew so
1725620	1730020	fast and large that land no longer explained our wealth. And gradually,
1730020	1734740	the economics profession parsed our explanations into capital and labor.
1735380	1741300	And using the social construct of credit, which is largely run by central banks
1741300	1746460	in the world right now, we pulled resource consumption forward in time. Now
1746460	1752020	our world views our future and our culture through a financial lens. We have
1752020	1756580	not only financialized the human experience, but also the explanation of
1756580	1762580	it. Okay, that's the energy material tech part of the story. Now, what about
1762580	1768100	the environment? What about the pollution that comes from our economic system?
1769100	1774380	This could be its own two hour talk, but I'll just give the highlights right
1774380	1780140	here. It's not just climate, but there are many aspects that the human system
1780140	1787580	is affecting the natural world. This shows the last 400,000 years of CO2 in
1787580	1791860	the atmosphere shown in green, global temperatures shown in the middle panel
1791860	1798100	in red, and sea level rise shown in the bottom in blue. We have already had
1798100	1803580	400 feet of sea level rise in the last 20,000 years, and we are in uncharted
1803580	1810100	territories from any time before the emion. We are now going into a warmer
1810100	1815020	period than at any time when humans lived on this planet. And I could argue
1815020	1820580	that humans are changing climate today, but climate change actually caused
1820620	1826900	humans. The red chart in the bottom is expanded here in the last 20,000 years.
1827900	1834060	Around 15,000 years ago, the climate warmed and stabilized, unbelievably
1834060	1838580	stable for the last 10,000 years, which is when we expanded around the world
1838580	1843780	with agriculture and settlements and hierarchy and technology, etc. And now
1843780	1848140	we're moving out of that stable band into the unknown. The only known is
1848140	1853580	it's barring a nuclear holocaust. It's likely to be warmer to much warmer.
1853780	1860340	So this carbon pulse that we are living through, yet it's invisible to us, is
1860340	1867060	really distinctly important because many, most of the prior mass and many
1867060	1873820	extinctions were correlated with carbon pulses. The blue spikes here show the
1873820	1878500	percentage of the genus level extinctions on Earth over the last
1878500	1884780	300 million years. And the magenta bars are when there were large outgassings
1884780	1892220	of volcanic provinces that were near term pulses of carbon. And this ended up
1892220	1898100	being disastrous for species on the planet. Unlike most mass extinctions
1898100	1903780	linked to volcanic pulses, our pulse is not from volcanoes, but from Volkswagen's
1903820	1910340	and vacations and deforestation and other things. This is a monthly graph of
1910340	1915860	the temperature anomaly from the pre-industrial baseline. You can see
1915860	1924700	that many of the hottest divergences are this year, 2024. One could argue that
1924700	1928860	this would be the coolest year of the rest of your lives. I'm not sure that's
1928860	1935220	entirely valid because this is an El Nino year, but you can see that the heat
1935260	1941420	is on. Part of the climate discussion that is not often discussed is the impact
1941420	1945780	on oceans and there are many, many ocean risks. There's ocean acidification.
1946180	1954380	There is the erosion of coastlines since the sea level is going to rise as the
1954420	1961660	glacier and ice melts. There's overfishing. There is the loss of some calcium
1961660	1967580	carbonate in shells. There's the impact on food webs. Ocean oxygen content is
1967580	1974820	already declined by 2% and 20% in the shallows. There are many, the AMOC, the
1974820	1978980	Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation in the Atlantic Ocean, has
1978980	1985340	slowed already 15%. This is all because the oceans are absorbing 90% of the
1985340	1992300	heat from the extra thermal warming from fossil fuels. Beyond climate itself
1992340	1996380	and climate is the key because it affects all the other things I'm talking
1996380	2001140	about, we neglect our impact on the other 10 million species we share this
2001140	2007620	planet with, what I refer to as the real stock market. Since I was born, we have
2007620	2014340	lost almost 70% of the animal populations on this planet and it's
2014340	2018460	probably worse than that because that's status is six years old. We don't see
2018460	2025100	that that much in North America because we've only lost 25% here, but in Asia
2025100	2031100	and Latin and South America, it's much more extreme. This chart shows on the
2031100	2037780	left the estimated biomass of wild animals 100,000 years ago relative to
2037780	2044220	the orange of wild animals today, relative to the light pink, which is our
2044220	2050580	cows, pigs and sheep and humans. So humans in our livestock now outweigh wild
2050580	2056260	mammals at a ratio of 50 to 1. It's not only animals, insects are declining at
2056260	2062260	1 to 2% a year in biomass. This is trillions of tiny robots doing tasks
2062260	2067300	humans couldn't do without them that we take for granted. Birds eat insects.
2067580	2072380	Birds are also declining. These are Canadian statistics here showing the
2072380	2078260	percentage decline of various types of birds. One thing that's increasingly in
2078260	2083540	the media is the impact not only of plastics like plastic bottles and the
2083580	2089500	fact that plastic now outweighs all animals on earth and will eventually
2089500	2094220	outweigh all the fish in the ocean, but microplastics. There's something called
2094220	2099260	PFAS, which is a forever chemical. We don't, scientists don't really understand
2099500	2105780	the endocrine disrupting impacts. However, sperm count in humans and in other
2105780	2110980	animals is declining at an accelerated pace globally. Sperm count is dropping at
2110980	2117580	around 2.5% a year. Right now, one couple in seven cannot have a baby because
2117580	2122660	of lack of sperm motility. And that's shocking. But what's even more shocking
2122660	2127220	is 20 years ago, it was zero in seven. And there are some estimates by 2050
2127220	2132300	under current trends that we won't be able to have babies. Okay, that's a
2132300	2136580	pretty rugged little summary I went through there. And it's as many times as I
2136580	2140700	say it, I still get kind of a pit in my stomach as I'm sharing this with
2140700	2145340	strangers online, because many of you are aware of those things. But if you
2145340	2149660	haven't heard those things before, it can feel like a punch to the gut. And I
2149660	2155460	will just empathize with you that that is a normal, totally acceptable reaction.
2155500	2160020	And if that is your reaction, I offer you a brief apology, but these are the
2160020	2163340	times we're alive. This is why I'm sharing this stuff, because I think most
2163340	2168060	people, more people need to understand and engage with these issues. Okay, let's
2168060	2173940	moving on to the core driver of this stuff, which is the human human behavior,
2174300	2181620	starting with our feelings. So we are related to every single other creature
2181620	2187380	on earth. We share a common universal ancestor. If you look on the tree of
2187380	2193100	life, there's humans way down here in the corner. We're 99.9% related to all
2193100	2198460	other humans, including Canadians, were 98% related to other apes, bonobos and
2198460	2204940	chimpanzees, 90% related to cats, 85% genetically related to mice, 80% to
2204940	2211740	cows, 60% to fruit flies, 60% to chickens, and we are 50% genetically related to
2211740	2216300	mushrooms. We are kin with everything else on this blue green earth. And we
2216300	2221940	often forget that. We go through our life, like other biological organisms,
2221940	2228260	trying to match the same emotional states of our successful ancestors. So
2228260	2234020	bagging a gazelle on the Pleistocene savanna. Today we make a stock trade or
2234020	2241620	make a Bitcoin profit and with the same areas in our brain light up. Humans are
2241620	2247540	intensely social and status conscious. This has to do with the concept of sexual
2247580	2254980	selection in nature, which in the case of a peacock, this giant ornate tail has
2254980	2261260	three fitness hits to the peacock. It is a cost of all its minerals and
2261260	2266580	calories going to this tail. It makes it more apparent and obvious to a predator
2266580	2271300	and if a predator chase it, it's harder to get away. All three of those were
2271300	2276900	overcome by the preference from the female peacock for such a display. And
2276980	2281060	are we that different than this? This picture here shows Tiger Woods, who's a
2281060	2286740	billionaire, his yacht pulling into a marina where his ex-wife's boyfriend's
2286740	2293220	yacht is 10 feet longer than his. So we constantly compare ourselves to others
2293220	2301300	at various scales, planet wide. We also have neural circuitry that hijacks our
2301300	2306500	ancestral reward system and tricks us into thinking that the things we're
2306500	2312020	doing are actually good for us and good for our status and our respect in our
2312020	2317860	tribe. For instance, some students may be watching this presentation, might play
2317860	2325380	Overwatch or some video game and their brains feel like they're bagging a
2325380	2329940	gazelle for their tribe, but they're actually sitting in a couch in their mom's
2329940	2335060	basement accessing a coal-fired server. The dopamine superhighway is really
2335060	2339700	central to planetary overshoot and our consumption because what ends up
2339700	2344580	happening, shown in this graph, there's academic research reference on the
2344580	2350660	bottom, that we get the signal and the signal causes the behavior and we do
2350660	2355380	the work and then we get the reward. We don't get the dopamine when the reward
2355380	2360340	happens, but before it's the anticipation of reward. But what ends up
2360340	2365060	happening in our culture is energy has become so cheap and we have such a
2365060	2370100	smorgasbord of consumption that our work and our behavior is disconnected from
2370100	2374020	the reward because we get reward all over the place all the time without doing
2374020	2379860	the work. So we end up in a situation and this is a picture of my storage shed
2380580	2387220	where the ghost of dopamine past ends up buying things constantly and the
2387220	2393220	wanting of things ends up being a more powerful driver of our behavior than
2393220	2397220	the having of them. All of you go home this weekend and look in your
2397220	2402660	garage, in your storage shed, etc. We got short-term dopamine hits for those
2402660	2407540	purchases, but they weren't sustainable and we had to buy more to feel the
2407540	2413300	same way at some point in the future. So important point, our brains are flow-based,
2413860	2419380	but our world, our economic system is stock-based and we're driving down the
2419380	2425460	stocks of non-reluable energy and resources millions of times faster than
2425460	2430500	they were built up in order to get ephemeral dopamine. In effect, we're
2430500	2435940	turning billions of barrels of ancient sunlight into microliters of neurotransmitters.
2435940	2442100	We also have different belief systems and the human brain can utter millions of times
2443140	2449460	more sentences than can exist in biophysical reality. So the virtual world in our minds
2450500	2456420	is really more powerful than our biophysical reality and this is why science in the academy
2456900	2464100	are hopefully can play a vital role in our path going forward because science is
2464100	2470900	a light in the dark and can distinguish fantasy from reality. It's the best tool that we have.
2472420	2480180	We are incredibly in-group and out-group oriented. We quickly and strongly form groups and we defend
2480180	2485620	and support our group and tend to ostracize and root against others. Groups could be a few people
2485620	2491860	or they could be nation-state size. Shown here is Canada beating the U.S. in hockey.
2493060	2501380	We are very social. We're ultra-social so our behaviors are plastic but we copy other humans
2501380	2507620	and this is good news because cultural evolution happens at lightning speed versus biological
2507620	2515460	evolution. Okay so those are the the primary drivers of the human ecosystem. How do those
2515460	2520980	fit together? How does the whole system fit together into a narrative that explains our
2520980	2527780	current reality? I'm sure you've seen starlings in nature. Starlings follow three simple rules.
2527780	2534500	Do what your neighbor does. Don't get too close and fly towards the center. Those three simple
2534500	2541460	rules result in this emergent behavior of these beautiful murmurations of birds in the sky that
2541460	2547620	look like they're choreographed but they're not. It's an emergent property. Humans do something
2547620	2554260	similar. In our current world importantly this is not the way that it always was and it's not the
2554260	2561860	way that it has to be in the future but we coordinate in our families, in our small businesses,
2561860	2569940	in our corporations, even as entire nations to acquire financial surplus which is linked to energy.
2569940	2576420	We spend the surplus and we pursue culturally accepted behaviors. The emergent property of that
2576420	2586820	is this vast interconnected material and energy hungry system of human habitation and commerce
2586900	2593300	across the planet. If you look at this, the brake lights and the headlights in this aerial view of a
2593300	2600900	city are not biophysically too dissimilar than the veins in the arteries of a human body and the
2600900	2606820	hemoglobin that is being passed through these veins and arteries is gasoline and diesel fuel
2606820	2613540	from oil and we have a global transport system. This is the airline routes through the earth.
2614420	2620740	So our culture keeps score of this system by gross domestic product. If you add up all the
2620740	2629620	countries in the world it's gross world product. Well GWP given the 99% correlation between energy
2629620	2639460	and GDP could rightly be named gross world burning because energy and GDP are and will remain tightly
2639460	2647700	linked. So my economic research, my academic research has likened human culture to an energy
2647700	2656500	dissipating structure, a mindless superorganism akin to a blind hungry amoeba. So human society
2656500	2663860	has a metabolism and metabolism has a waste product in the form of CO2 and other things.
2664580	2671940	So the global north has been trying to go to renewable energy, getting rid of coal although
2671940	2677940	we're still using natural gas, but the developing world especially China and India are growing
2677940	2685300	as much energy as they can. So since the 2015 Paris Agreement we actually have a global increase
2685300	2691860	in coal use. China is building six times more new coal plants. India plans to double their coal
2691860	2696740	production. They are aware of climate. India is going to be one of the most susceptible countries
2696740	2700900	to climate. The reason they're doubling their coal is because it's the cheapest thing that they can
2700900	2707620	do and they need more air conditioning and fans. So trying to mitigate climate change within our
2707620	2714580	existing economic structure is like arguing with a forest fire. This is an uncomfortable conclusion
2715380	2721300	but it's one that I've come to believe. There is no one driving the bus of our economic system,
2721300	2729220	not politicians, not billionaires, not the rich and powerful. The market is pulling us forward
2729220	2734980	and we have outsourced our wisdom and decision making to the financial markets. So this is kind
2734980	2742020	of a metaphor from Lord of the Rings, the Tower of Sauron. I've graphically shown here the history
2742020	2749620	of humans and technology. Shown in the bottom is we left our hunter-gatherer ancestry and started
2749620	2756260	to produce agriculture which created agricultural surplus which we could trade. We had hierarchy
2756260	2762980	then. We had mayors and kings and artisans and warriors and accountants and then a couple hundred
2762980	2770020	years ago we accessed the power in flammable fossils and then we turbocharged this faster by
2770580	2776420	creating fiat currency that were markers for real things and we accelerated the whole thing
2776500	2783620	and now we're using artificial intelligence to make all these processes even faster and this whole
2783620	2792740	thing is this Borg or this Eye of Sauron pulling this economic system forward and it's my opinion
2792740	2798420	and there's ample evidence in the last few months to underpin this is under our current
2798420	2805540	economic aspirations and goals which are of course fluid in our lifetimes. Artificial intelligence
2805540	2812180	is going to much like shale fracking act as a larger draw on the energy in the environment and
2812180	2817940	that doesn't include it doesn't focus only on how much energy the servers are. Today a news story
2817940	2823700	came out that said that just the data servers alone in the United States are going to use as much
2823700	2831700	energy between now and 2030 as 150 million electric vehicles. That's not the point. The point is that
2831780	2836660	AI is going to make energy extraction. It's going to make alternative energy. It's going to make
2836660	2843380	all the processes in our world more efficient potentially and all of that is going to accelerate
2843380	2848260	impact on the environment. Okay we're getting nearer to the conclusions of this part one.
2849140	2852740	Under the framing that I presented here what is not likely to happen?
2853380	2857780	Growing the economy and mitigating climate change and the six mass extinction.
2858580	2863860	Growing the economy by replacing fossil fuels with renewables we're actually adding.
2864740	2871460	Culture en masse choosing to leave fossil carbon in the ground and governments embracing limits
2871460	2877940	to growth before limits to growth are well past. Under this framing what is likely to happen?
2877940	2884340	A growth in gross energy while net energy declines. Massive money creation and financial
2884340	2890980	market support by central banks and governments. Wider and deeper poverty globally and more inequality.
2891700	2897780	AI is going to accelerate the energy and environmental problems unless we shift our goals.
2898580	2905860	A right word shift in politics because as things get scary and uncertain people tend to get more
2905860	2911540	conservative and want ways things to be the way they used to be in the past. This is happening
2911540	2917780	rapidly in Europe. We're yet to see what's going to happen in North America. A reduction paradoxically
2917780	2923140	in global environmental regulations and under the superorganism framing it's going to be
2923140	2929860	pedal to the metal until we hit some sort of a crisis or hit a wall. Implications and scenarios
2930420	2938420	of all this. So there are generally four scenarios that are discussable. One is a green growth future
2938420	2944500	that we use technology and create more productivity in the world and we become
2944500	2949220	so profitable and productive that we can use the excess to heal the environment.
2950740	2956900	The second scenario is what I refer to as the Mordor economy which is we are going to continue
2956900	2965460	to grow but more and more of our economic energy and materials will be directed to the energy and
2965460	2972660	mining sector of the economy meaning there will be less available for hospitals and universities
2973220	2980340	and entertainment and travel and things like that because our economy will instead of using
2980340	2985700	five percent of our energy to get the energy materials it'll be 10 percent and 15 percent and
2985700	2992740	18 percent leaving less for discretionary society. I call this the Mordor economy and I would say
2992740	2999620	this is the default. We're also going to need more and more energy and money to mitigate environmental
2999620	3008580	problems like droughts and floods and hurricanes and heat problems etc. Let me explain the trajectory
3008580	3016500	of the Mordor economy using this chart. The red line on the far left is when Reverend Thomas Malthus
3016500	3024740	lived on the planet and he said that the geometric production of humans would outstrip our arithmetic
3024740	3031700	production of food and he was wrong. He was wrong because he didn't know about fossil fuels that were
3031700	3038420	underneath the ground. Fast forward to 1969 and Paul Ehrlich wrote a book called The Population Bomb
3038420	3044820	saying many similar things and he was wrong at least about that at that time because he didn't
3044820	3052740	know about debt that we have increased our debt faster than we've increased our GDP in every single
3052740	3059940	year since 1969 and he didn't know about globalization that we could outsource the production of things
3059940	3067620	to the least cost areas in the world. Fast forward to 2009 the next red line and we had a great financial
3067620	3074420	crisis that was bailed out by the central banks taking over the role of monetary creation from
3074420	3081140	the commercial banks. We had COVID in 2020 again the bazooka of the Federal Reserve and other
3081140	3091220	financial guarantees and what will be the next can to kick. If we grow at 3% a year that means the
3091220	3099540	energy and materials given the stats I said earlier will double every 30 years so if there is a 15
3099540	3106100	year old watching this presentation by the time she is 75 there will not only be a doubling but
3106100	3114500	a quadrupling in the energy and material use of the human economy. Is that possible? Is that desirable?
3114500	3118900	What happens if that happens? What happens if it doesn't happen? These are some of the central
3118900	3125620	questions of our time. So that is the Mordor economy. The third category which is what I've
3125700	3131940	named my podcast in my work is called the great simplification which is we will not continue
3131940	3139540	to grow but we manage a graceful descent. The average person in America uses 100 times more
3139540	3145620	energy than our bodies need in terms of calories. If we went down to 70 or 60 or 50 it wouldn't
3145620	3153060	necessarily be a bad thing. So the great simplification is at some point in coming decades
3153060	3159780	when we remove this ubiquitous credit with a shift to more costly energy and resources
3159780	3165780	and a return to solar inputs and renewables which are viable but more costly in a system wide
3165780	3171220	perspective we will no longer be able to maintain our system of financial claims and one of the
3171220	3177860	next three recessions will be a depression. There is a musical chair element to our current
3177860	3183700	system of claims and I refer to this as a great simplification shown here as one trajectory out
3184820	3191220	for the next 30 years. Lastly there would be the fourth quadrant would be the Mad Max scenario
3191220	3198900	which is that we decline and there is no stability and social contract holding things together and
3198900	3204500	I'm sure you've seen enough movies about that scenario. However in our social discourse the
3204500	3210020	vast majority of people talk about this one scenario and the other three scenarios are really
3210020	3217620	not given that much discourse. I would argue that the true odds are more like the areas of
3217620	3225140	these shapes shown here and I'm advocating that we should consciously try towards a great simplification
3225140	3232740	which is a smaller more local economy that still has the benefits of civilization but different
3232740	3239460	relationships with each other with the natural world and hopefully less pollution to the other
3239460	3246980	species and ecosystems. Between here and there however we have some constraints that are now
3247780	3253300	unavoidable and I want to briefly talk about what I call the four horsemen of the 2020s
3254260	3260260	which I have recently changed the five horsemen. The first one is a financial bend or break moment.
3260260	3266740	We keep papering over our problems with more credit and central bank largesse. In the past 10
3266740	3272820	years government debt has grown 60 percent to 83 trillion dollars. Corporate debt household debt have
3272820	3279540	also grown. We are in a new era where every few months we're increasing the debt in the United
3279540	3286340	States by a trillion dollars. We're just adding that we're transmuting wealth into income. We have
3286340	3293060	this natural endowment of resources energy and ecosystems and we're creating new claims on that
3293060	3302180	at an accelerating rate. So we create debt much more faster than GDP but we're stretching this
3302180	3309140	relationship to our underpinning reality and there's going to be a snapback at some point because
3309140	3315220	all these financial claims that we're creating will eventually have to be paid back in energy and
3315220	3320660	materials and ecosystem services. The reason that you don't hear talks like this is there is no
3320660	3326980	credible institution or government body in the world that is specifically planning for an end
3326980	3332100	to growth because it's a very uncomfortable conversation to have. So in the meantime we're
3332100	3337540	papering over our problems with more and more credit while the energetic and material basis for
3337540	3344100	our currencies deplete. So we don't think of it this way but when we take on debt as a nation,
3344100	3349940	as a company or as a person, the debt must be paid back with energy but as I said earlier our
3349940	3356660	energy, our high quality energy is starting to flatline and will eventually start to decline
3356660	3360420	but at the same time we're growing the red line which is our monetary markers.
3361620	3369780	Okay second horseman of the next decade is geopolitics. This is June 7th. There are Russian
3369780	3376180	warships headed to the Caribbean. Russia announced yesterday they're going to be selling weapons to
3376180	3383460	countries that are antagonistic to the West. We are approaching this biophysical shift from a world
3383460	3390500	that focused on money and technology to one that focuses on energy and ecology and a lot of the
3390500	3396900	energy in the world is in countries that aren't necessarily so friendly to us. Around two-thirds
3396980	3404820	of the remaining oil is within 600 miles of Israel. Around half of the world's purchasable oil
3404820	3411700	navigates this strait of Hormuz, this two-mile wide strait between Iran and Saudi Arabia every
3411700	3419860	day. These are things that we take for granted. In the, I would say unlikely, I don't know how
3419860	3426980	unlikely it is, it's certainly possible but we have between the United States and Russia about
3426980	3435060	12,000 nuclear warheads and if there were to be an exchange or a strategic escalation this graph
3435060	3440580	shows the impact on climate. This is one way that the climate would actually cool is if there were
3440580	3446180	enough nuclear weapons sent into the atmosphere that the soot blocked out the sun. This would be
3446180	3452580	the absolute worst Armageddon disaster scenario of all because although the climate would ultimately
3452580	3458820	be cooler it would wipe out most of complex life in the process. This is a crappy thing to say to
3458820	3464740	a bunch of Canadian scientists but this is something that our society has shrugged under the carpet
3464740	3469780	and is a very real risk in our world. People were really worried about it 50, 60 years ago
3470740	3479140	and now it's really not in part of our discourse. Also we have to realize that we have a six
3479140	3489060	continent supply chain, this globally interconnected economy that is just in time products. 80% of our
3489060	3494820	pharmaceutical ingredients are made in China and India for the United States which has 4%
3494820	3500500	of the world's population and 50% of the world's medical prescriptions. We have many many just in
3500500	3507060	time supply chains that some complicated part is made in South Korea and ends up in Toronto
3507060	3512980	three days later that without that part we couldn't do some industrial process so this is something
3512980	3518580	that we take for granted. Also the social contract I don't know how things are in Canada
3519460	3525620	but things are really starting to get a little uncomfortable in the United States.
3525620	3530180	There is an enormous partisan divide in the media in the United States. Very few people
3530900	3536340	read the same news sources, we have different facts, artificial intelligence is making it
3536340	3542100	difficult to believe what is true or what is not which is another reason that the academy is vital
3542100	3548660	for coming decades because we trust in scientists is declining but it's still among the highest
3548660	3555460	trust that people have is in science. The fifth horseman which if you live in British Columbia
3555460	3562180	and other places you're already aware of is the ongoing impacts of climate change on our ecosystem.
3563140	3567940	There are droughts, there are floods, there are fires, there are wet bulb temperatures where
3567940	3576980	people can't survive. The other day in Delhi, India it was 129 degrees in early June.
3578020	3583540	Climate is warming right now and this is going to be a story for the rest of our lives. I promise
3583540	3589460	you that I'm going to leave you with some actionable ideas and directions but I do think
3589460	3594340	it's important to understand the landscape of what we face. Here are some summary points
3594340	3601700	of the first part of this presentation. Long term growth was not the norm. We are living through a
3601700	3610180	unique exponential period of economic growth for our species. There were several periods in the last
3610180	3618260	2,000 years that lasted for hundreds of years with flat to declining growth. All of our economic
3618260	3625700	rules and explanations of how the world works were created in this little red bubble here
3625700	3631220	and what does that pretend for the future. Cheap abundant fossil energy underpins our
3631220	3637620	societies and our society's expectations. This is a stock that we have culturally treated as a flow.
3638340	3645220	It is principle we're drawing down, not interest. We have completed the proximate drivers of
3645220	3650660	progress and growth with the ultimate drivers. Most people think that politics, technology,
3650660	3658500	and money are what drive our economic systems but they are sitting on top of a large
3659940	3668100	flux of around half a billion fossil worker equivalents and on the living, breathing
3668100	3674660	biosphere of which we're all dependent. We don't pay for the ecosystem services of Mother Earth.
3675220	3681700	As long as growing GDP is our global goal, better technology is going to tend to grow and
3681700	3687620	not shrink CO2 emissions and impact because of the rebound effect and Jeven's paradox.
3687620	3695460	Technology could be really important for future decades but it's going to have to be stuff that
3695540	3700420	is appropriate for our economies and we're going to have to change our economic system
3700420	3705140	if this is no longer going to be the case. In other words, the energy transition which is
3705140	3711220	oft lauded in the press is not really about energy. It's ultimately about how we relate to
3711220	3717060	each other, how we relate to the natural world, our levels of consumption, our change in consciousness,
3717060	3722180	and all that. Yes, energy will also play a role but it's not the driver. Barring a new
3722180	3727460	boost in productivity which is possible. It's kind of on the come. I don't know from artificial
3727460	3733860	intelligence. Growth is likely soon over and when that happens there is a musical chair situation
3733860	3739620	and the first challenge is going to be responding to a financial recalibration. At that moment we
3740420	3745940	should aim for bending which is holding the system together and landing at a lower material
3745940	3752660	throughput scale as opposed to breaking. Breaking would be bad. Rather than choose austerity,
3752660	3757940	governments and central banks will continue to print and monetize debt eventually leading
3757940	3765300	to currency debasement and possibly currency reform. We do not actually face a resource
3765300	3772260	shortage but rather a longage of expectations. As I said earlier, the average American uses
3772260	3779460	100 times more energy than our bodies need. Most of the best things in life are free after basic
3779460	3787060	needs are met. Here's me reading a story to my dog at bedtime with two of my college friends
3788180	3793460	talking about birds and doing bird songs with a bunch of kindergarteners in India
3794020	3798820	and some friends I met. I just got back from India a couple months ago. Another point,
3798900	3802980	we do need renewables and technology but the way they're touted now,
3803700	3810260	the renewables are the right answer to the wrong question. The question is how do we land the
3810260	3817380	plane this century with viable technology that supports ecosystems and a thriving human population?
3818260	3824260	Right now we're just using renewables as kind of an appendage to the global super organism,
3824260	3831220	not as a construction of a new system. There is a biophysical phase shift occurring in global
3831220	3838260	politics, alliances and agreements. This means there's a shift between, as I said earlier,
3838260	3843860	money and technology narratives to energy and material narratives and that is going to change
3843860	3849300	the power structure and the international agreements and the trade and the economic growth
3849300	3855540	in the future. Climate change is not the problem but climate change is one of many
3855540	3861300	symptoms of a much larger dynamic dysfunction which is the ecological concept of overshoot
3861300	3867220	which is a species, in this case ours, has overshot the carrying capacity of the planet
3867220	3874020	given our current population and consumption levels. This is a scene from the movie Don't
3874020	3881220	Look Up which was so spot on that I included it in this presentation. This presentation that I'm
3881220	3888500	telling you all today cannot be voiced aloud in politics and media because it's too strange,
3888500	3893940	it's too complex, it's too abstract, it's too threatening, there are no easy answers and if
3893940	3899940	senior people verbally share that they agree with this, what are the solutions? It becomes
3899940	3905140	politically dicey and uncomfortable. That doesn't mean we shouldn't discuss it, we have to discuss
3905140	3909940	it behind the scenes to create blueprints, a break glass in case of emergency and other
3911140	3919060	paths forward. Last point here is our current resource tech situation can power a great culture
3919060	3926420	and a meaningful civilization, just not this one, not at this size and scale. The current system uses
3926420	3936180	19 terawatts of power continuously which is 190 billion light bulbs turned on 24-7,
3936180	3943940	that is not sustainable. What do we do to get out of this? I think the only way out is through
3943940	3951780	and here are some thoughts at various scales of what we should do. I no longer talk about solutions,
3951780	3958740	I prefer to talk about responses and there are million possible responses. Each of you sitting
3959380	3964740	in the audience or sitting at your office or at your home, just briefly think about what do you
3964740	3970420	think the solution is? What do you think some of the responses should be to the human predicament
3970420	3976660	that I've just laid out the choreography of? And by the way, I may have some pieces of it wrong
3976660	3982500	and I learn stuff every day and I may be missing some important things, but I think if you squint
3982500	3988980	and look at how the pieces fit together, I think what I've described will roughly hold its shape
3988980	3996340	in the coming decades. So if you think about what would be the responses to what I just described,
3996980	4002900	they are different to different people based on what they care about, where they live,
4002900	4010660	what their value system is. There are a list of solutions for rich or well off people or
4010660	4016580	rich or well off countries. There is a list of solutions for poorer countries and people.
4017620	4022500	There is a list of responses and solutions for other species and other ecosystems.
4023140	4029300	And there's a list of unborn humans of future generations and unborn of other species of the
4029300	4036500	10 million currently species we share the planet with. So there's not one size fit all responses.
4036500	4042500	So keeping that in mind, most people care about themselves. The only thing we might care about
4042500	4048260	more than ourselves is our children. But beyond that, our family, our community, our region,
4048260	4054340	our nation, our world, other species, other generations get exponentially less care and
4054340	4060820	our economic decisions. This is also something that we have to recognize when we talk about responses.
4061860	4069300	So in effect, we are somewhere between the yellow star and the red star. And all of our cultural
4069300	4078900	stories are about the green arrow continuing forward in time. So here is the way that I
4078900	4086260	think about this. There are three distinct timelines for interventions. The red is the
4086260	4094340	time now before the crises arrive that we have to prepare as best as we can as individuals,
4094980	4101620	as universities, as communities, as nations, given the synthesis I've laid out. The yellow
4101620	4107700	is the time where there this financial recalibration happens that could be as soon as three months or
4107700	4117220	15 years. I don't know. But that is when there's going to be a currency bond financial reckoning.
4117940	4123460	And I think we have to focus in that moment and now in preparing for that moment to bend
4123460	4130660	and not break. And then where do we land this plane metaphorically? What are the sustainable
4130660	4139540	practices that Canadians and humans around the earth should start practicing for the longer term?
4139540	4144340	Because that's what's going to be more sustainable. So there are people that should be working on all
4144340	4151300	three of these timelines and everyone's preference is different. But it's not just let's do one thing.
4151300	4156100	There are three timelines. And not only are there different timelines, but there are different
4156100	4162660	scales. And I'm going to briefly give a list here of some some categories of response at the global
4162660	4169620	level, the civil society community level for the academy and universities and for individual humans.
4170660	4176260	So culturally, we have a road closed sign ahead of us. And many of us are starting to
4176900	4183620	see that in the distance that what we're doing is unsustainable. So what is the goal of a talk
4183620	4190180	like this? What is the goal of my podcast and my work? It's to normalize the conversations around
4190180	4196420	these topics. So we get more people involved in discussing them, being pro-social and being creative
4196420	4201860	and rolling up their sleeves and getting engaged. What we're trying to do now is change the initial
4201860	4208900	conditions of the future moments when these events start to ensue. So what we're doing is kind of
4208900	4215620	creating a time capsule to imagine what are the things we're going to be need to be doing in coming
4215620	4221300	decades. So here's some categories to consider. At the global level, first of all, as I mentioned
4221300	4228340	earlier, we are moving from a unipolar world to a multipolar world. And what are the governance
4228340	4234420	structures and ways of doing things that will allow a peaceful navigation through that period?
4235380	4241220	Another is our incentives. We look at the prices of things, and then we make economic decisions.
4241220	4250900	But everything that our culture aspires to is linked to GDP, monetary surplus, and growth. And
4250900	4257300	if we change our incentives to include nature and human health and well-being and the ecosystem
4257300	4263140	health of the world, that's going to mean different incentives, different prices, and different
4263220	4270340	signals. So one thing that I don't know how viable it is to do right now, but we could add
4270340	4278020	a tax to anything that is an input to our economic system that is non-renewable in nature. Not only
4278020	4286420	carbon, but copper or fossil water aquifers or lithium or anything like that. If we add a tax to
4286420	4294500	these things, what will happen is our devices will be much more expensive, but we will give
4294500	4301540	signals to consumers to conserve things that are mostly non-renewable. And we will give signals to
4301540	4307220	inventors and innovators about the real cost of depleting things, and they will use these
4307220	4315140	scarcer resources more sparingly. So we will conserve and innovate at a better level. The main
4315220	4321620	input to renewables is human labor. So if we added a tax and we taxed everything that was
4321620	4326820	non-renewable, we would remove all taxes on individuals and corporations. We would have to
4326820	4334580	have some sort of a regressive help for that would be a regressive tax scheme, but it would
4334580	4340980	favor renewable buildout and other things that weren't dependent on non-renewable inputs.
4341140	4346100	In addition to changing the incentives, we need to change the aspirations. So this graph is from
4346100	4352580	Canadian Voslav Smil, who is at Winnipeg, showing that the energy supply used per capita
4354100	4360900	gives us a massive increase in well-being and a human development index from low levels. But once
4360900	4367540	we're at around 100 gigajoules per capita, any additional increase in energy consumption per
4367540	4374100	capita doesn't give us that much. The United States uses almost three times as much energy per
4374100	4380420	capita as Italy or Japan, yet we're about the same on the human development index, and we're
4380420	4388980	actually declining in life expectation and other diseases of despair in my nation. So to move beyond
4388980	4398820	GDP, again, most of the best things in life are free after basic needs are met. If I asked you
4398820	4404500	while watching this presentation, what are your five best memories of your life, most of you would
4404500	4410740	not say that they required a lot of money or energy, but it would be playing cards at a slumber party
4410740	4417700	with your friends or fishing on Lake of the Woods with your family or time in nature in the beautiful
4417700	4423940	forests in Canada with your dogs or things that don't require a lot of energy and money in our
4423940	4429860	society. Our individuals recognize this, but our society, because we've outsourced things to the
4429860	4438180	market, do not. We need an icon to represent the future of the 3000-some emojis on our phone. There
4438180	4446420	is no icon to represent the future. My colleague, DJ White and I created this tee with an arrow,
4446420	4453220	just as a suggestion, but we need something to represent the future. Another category is advanced
4453220	4457780	policy. The reason that it's called advance and not policy is the things that we're going to need to
4457780	4465700	do as a governing body in Canada and the US and the world can't be happening at the margin because
4465700	4472100	they're too politically or socially difficult now. So we need to have something like a council of
4472100	4478900	elders that is building break glass plans or blueprints or in case of emergency do this ahead
4478900	4485220	of time so we know what to do when some of these events come to pass. Like the Bender Break moment,
4485220	4491860	I talked about the rubber band snapping back in the financial system. From the perspective of
4491860	4498260	the carbon pulse, what governance structures best fit after the red star? I don't know the answer to
4498260	4505620	that, but democracy and communism and things like that were designed for small groups of people,
4505620	4513060	not necessarily 8 billion people. This is a conversation for a political scientist to integrate
4513060	4520020	the biophysical story that I'm telling here. We need different technology. Technology is vital,
4521060	4526820	but the technology that we have now is just feeding the hungry ghost of the economic super
4526820	4533060	organism. As I said earlier, solar panels can power a wonderful civilization, just not this one.
4533620	4538980	So from the perspective of the carbon pulse, what are the top four human inventions of all time?
4538980	4546340	According to Nate, the bicycle is the most energy efficient invention ever made to get a person from
4546340	4552420	point A to point B using the least amount of energy is a bicycle. The story or playing Dungeons
4552420	4558260	and Dragons or anything that is in the virtual world of our mind, sitting with other humans,
4558260	4564740	the unexpected reward and novelty of listening to other people is free, and it's an amazing
4564740	4570500	invention. Number two is the dog, which really isn't an invention. It's a co-evolution. This is my
4571540	4579380	Golden Retriever Quinn. They give us unlimited oxytocin, serotonin, and some dopamine,
4579620	4586500	and what a wonderful thing. By the way, I could not do this work without having a Golden Retriever
4586500	4591780	around because it's pretty intense. And the number one invention could be music because we are,
4592580	4598100	can be transformed again with not a lot of energy and materials into a different mental
4598100	4607300	state and emotional state and physical state from music. So Homo sapiens is wise man. So far,
4607300	4613460	we've been much more clever than wise. What sort of technology will be most suited for the downslope
4613460	4621460	of the carbon pulse? I think something that I would refer to as Goldilocks tech, which is not
4621460	4629300	some fancy drone gadget and not going back to the Stone Age, but something in between that's
4629300	4636820	scalable and affordable and sensible. For instance, instead of lithium mining in Bolivia, we can make
4636820	4642180	batteries from sodium, which is from salt. It's a simpler material. It's not as powerful,
4642820	4650660	not as great as lithium, but it's a Goldilocks tech. There are many, many such things like that,
4650660	4655700	and I think we should start thinking two or three steps ahead about that sort of technology.
4655700	4662100	Of course, the market and the superorganism will continue forward and do all kinds of fancy dopamine
4662100	4670180	creating expensive splashes of technology, but we need to at the same time simultaneously be
4670180	4675860	building out these alternative technologies and using them and scaling them in communities around
4675860	4683940	the world. Globally, we also need to change our culture towards more of a regenerative society,
4684900	4691060	and that means right now we are not only the regeneration that hits the earth and net primary
4691060	4697620	productivity all over the earth, how much plants grow every year. We're taking 40% of that and adding
4697620	4704420	it to the human system, leaving 60% for the other 10 million species, but in addition to that, we're
4704420	4709860	taking millions of years of stored productivity and adding it to the system. This is patently
4709860	4718100	unsustainable, and for instance, we need to have global cooling shown on the left is whale poop.
4718100	4723700	Whale poop acts as a carbon sink in the ocean because the phytoplankton bloom and then drop
4723700	4730980	to the bottom and they sequester carbon. Shown here is biochar, a new farming technology that
4733460	4742420	absorbs carbon into the soil, so we need a whole new culture shift in the way that we think about
4742420	4749300	our economic system. I would offer, especially to the young people watching this, that we have
4749300	4757780	arrived at a species-level conversation where we know GDP is ultimately self-terminating either
4757780	4766020	ecologically or with war on our current path. I offer perhaps we could aspire to a life ethic,
4766020	4772180	and I'll briefly read the components of that. Life existing is preferable to no life existing.
4772740	4779380	More kinds of life existing is preferable to fewer. Vibrant, complex ecosystems are preferable to
4779380	4785940	small, fragmented, brittle ecosystems. Ecosystems with large, complex life are preferable to
4785940	4791860	ecosystems with only microscopic life. Ecosystems supporting conscious minds, which are the
4792420	4799380	virtual worlds of human minds and gorillas and dolphins, etc., are preferable to ecosystems
4799380	4805700	without them. It is preferable to maximize existence, happiness, love, and understanding,
4805700	4812820	and to minimize the suffering of minds in the universe. The future, both near and far, is real
4812820	4819220	in the same sense that now is real, and via causality is determined by what is done now.
4820180	4825060	Things which are preferable by this definition may be considered good. Things which are less
4825060	4831460	preferable may be considered evil. We should maximize good and minimize evil since the universe
4831460	4837540	does not. So it's one of my wishes is to educate and inspire humans, to culturally extend,
4837540	4844340	not narrow our circle of care. This is happening around the world with ecosystem restoration,
4844340	4850260	and there are a lot of humans that are trying to step towards a regenerative culture.
4851140	4857620	That's at the top scale. What about civil society? We need better education, shown here
4857620	4868580	as a civilian land core of young people learning ecological skills and how to sequester carbon
4868580	4876580	and grow food and other things. We are headed for a simplification. We see this road close sign
4876580	4882100	ahead. All many of us feel it. I call it the walking worried, and yet there's still all this
4882100	4888580	entertainment and smorgasbord and Amazon brown truck deliveries and cool vacation junkets and
4888580	4893700	hockey games and all this stuff. In the meantime, so we get distracted. But if you look two or three
4893700	4899220	steps ahead, all this information, especially if you understand human behavior, you know that
4899220	4904900	en masse as a culture, we're not going to voluntarily tighten our belt, which means we will eventually
4904900	4912100	hit a wall. What can we do to simplify ahead of that time? By simplify, I mean reduce complexity,
4912100	4920580	reduce energy consumption, and any individual, any town, any country that voluntarily reduces
4920580	4929780	complexity first will be outcompeted by other individuals, towns and nations, which is something
4929780	4937380	called a multipolar trap. But some nations or towns will be forced to do this because maybe
4937380	4944580	there's a natural gas pipeline is shut off to Germany, etc. So there is a short term cost to
4944580	4952260	simplifying, but a long term gain because those people, towns, universities, nations that do this
4952260	4958260	first, while everything holds together are going to develop new models and new ways of doing things
4959540	4966180	that those that are still the the rabbit running around at the high consumption level won't have
4966180	4973300	time to do it once things change. Supply chains, again, showing this Byzantine structured
4974900	4981860	Rube Goldberg machine, which is the global supply chain, as things become more sensitive
4981860	4987940	and fragile in the global system, and as energy becomes more expensive, and as credit becomes
4987940	4993540	less available, the world is beginning to going to become a larger place again. So localizing,
4993540	5000900	on shoring, near shoring, regionalizing supply chains, especially for basic goods and important
5000900	5008500	things is going to be important. Shown here is the red circle. I think Toronto is within that
5008500	5014740	circle. I'm not even sure. And, you know, that would be the real core stuff. And then the blue
5014740	5021780	circle is, you know, you trade with with other areas. But those areas are much easier to get to
5022420	5029220	than China or India or South Korea, etc. A shadow council, one of my favorite movies was
5029220	5034740	Contact with Jody Foster, and they built a machine that would travel to outer space. But there was
5034740	5040100	a religious fundamentalist that sabotage the machine, and we thought the movie was over.
5040100	5047700	But lo and behold, they had another machine that they built not telling anyone in Hokkaido, Japan,
5047700	5053860	and Jody Foster, spoiler alert, ended up traveling to another dimension. In the same way,
5053860	5060820	our city councils and the high status humans at universities as well will be resistant to the
5060820	5069300	information in this presentation for many very valid reasons. So to construct a shadow council,
5069300	5074180	which ostensibly doesn't have the power and the authority as the regular city council,
5074180	5078260	but they can be talking about these things and learning and building social capital and
5078260	5083940	creating ideas ahead of time. It's something that's working off to the side that's unofficial,
5083940	5089940	but it's still working towards a great simplification. I can't speak to Canada, but the
5089940	5098420	United States is really bifurcated. We have echo chambers, many, many of them. Here's a list of
5098420	5105460	memetic tribes from left to right politically. There are many different social groups that
5105460	5111060	really don't talk to each other, and we're going to need diplomats that can suppress their own
5111860	5116500	political agendas and the things that they care about in order to host discussions
5116500	5121940	with wider groups of humans, because without that, we're really in trouble. So we need to have
5122020	5128980	diplomacy and facilitation with people that don't agree with us. Transmutation,
5129860	5136660	a word from King Midas who everything he touched turned to gold. Everything we've been doing is
5136660	5148100	transmuting the natural world over time into money over time. So while we can change monetary
5148100	5154180	markers into real capital, real capital is natural capital, which is our forests and our
5154180	5160420	healthy soil and our rivers. Social capital is our friends, our relationships. Here's two of my dogs.
5161380	5167300	That dog shown there, Maisie, is going to be 14 in September, by the way. This is my house,
5167300	5172900	built capital. There's solar panels and chainsaws and an aloe vera plant and human capital, which is
5172900	5180660	our health and our knowledge and our skills. These are real capital, and we should use our
5180660	5190740	monetary markers to turn into more of these things. Healing. We have, most of our population
5190740	5197460	has experienced trauma. Some of you are probably experiencing trauma watching this presentation.
5197540	5203700	We are increasingly an unhealthy society, and in order to address some of the challenges I'm
5203700	5209780	presenting today, I suggest we need in every community across Canada and in the United States
5209780	5217140	and in the world libraries, but we also need libraries of healing, where we have mental health,
5218340	5224900	buttressing and meditation and exercise and healthy food and dance and community events and
5225780	5231460	social interactions. I spent six weeks in India earlier this year, and I was surrounded with 30
5231460	5237460	people for six weeks, and we chanted and sang every morning and did calisthenics. Then we had
5237460	5245300	lectures, and we've become so rich as a culture, on average, that we just live in our own little
5245300	5250900	castles and order stuff online, and we don't need people anymore. But in the near future,
5250900	5257620	we're going to need people again, and we're going to need to have healing of people. I think mental
5257620	5263540	health, as we approach the Great Simplification, is going to be a huge issue. There are many people
5263540	5271220	who are qualified, who are watching this show, this presentation right now, in Canada that have
5271220	5280180	abilities to make this happen. A life brigade, again, this is my appeal to an animist respect
5280180	5289060	of nature. We need a cultural change, some of us, to say, no, the superorganism is not allowed
5289060	5296660	in this corner of Canada, in this part of my community in Saskatchewan or in Ontario. This
5296660	5303220	part is sacred, and the economic superorganism is not allowed here. This is not an economic
5303220	5310420	statistical argument. This is an argument from the heart that we treat these things as sacred.
5311540	5318500	As this entire economic system has increased, and now including artificial intelligence,
5319380	5326500	are we in service of power or of life is a central question for the coming decades.
5327940	5335140	Moving to the academy, and again, I have a PhD, but I'm not affiliated with the university now. I
5335140	5339700	used to teach at the University of Minnesota. These are just some suggestions of the importance
5340900	5345380	that the universities around the world and in Canada can play towards this story.
5345380	5352980	First of all, is we need to realize the context of our lives. So, again, the global human economy
5352980	5359700	is a thousand times bigger than it was five centuries ago. Most of the science about humans
5359700	5365940	and about human societies, especially social science, was developed during this very anomalous
5365940	5372420	period. I think the academy needs to understand the carbon pulse and the moment that we're at
5373300	5380260	because it informs all of our futures, and so this should be a driving backdrop for all
5380260	5388260	people at universities is to understand some part of the system's story. So, instead of silos,
5389300	5394820	academic silos, we really need to integrate the disciplines at universities around the world and
5394820	5402660	have people horizontally doing horizontal and vertical research and sharing and integrating
5402660	5408580	because it's the system science integration that matters. The time of reductionist
5409540	5416180	expertise is over. We still need that, but only as part of a larger narrative.
5417540	5423060	What does education look like? What are the things that we need to be teaching young people
5423060	5431700	as we approach the nadir of the carbon pulse? What are some of the things we teach at universities
5431700	5437860	that are really trivia and facts and figures that are no longer relevant to the future? What are the
5437860	5444100	things that are going to matter to the young humans that will live during the 21st century?
5444100	5453860	I think it's an incredible opportunity for the privileged academic curious people who are professors
5454580	5462020	to apply whatever their knowledge is with a passion and intensity that matches the scale
5462020	5468020	and stakes of our time, and so still be scientists, be the best scientists you can be,
5468020	5473700	but also be warriors at the same time because you have a contribution to make. Maybe it's
5474180	5481620	developing an alternative to PFAS chemistry in our products, or maybe it's a new
5482500	5488260	collective governance system, or maybe it's a regenerative agricultural technology. I mean,
5488260	5494900	there's vast contributions that the academy can make, but we need to wake up and really rise to
5494900	5501700	the occasion because the academy has more degrees of freedom than a lot of areas of our culture.
5502660	5507060	I suggest that for those professors that are approaching retirement,
5507620	5514900	that in the last few years before they retire, they do a pro-social capstone that is relevant
5514900	5522180	to this biophysical story of humans in our future, that is a contribution to the future of humanity
5522180	5529700	given their domain and their expertise. And lastly, I suggest that many social
5529700	5535940	contracts have occurred in the past. This is 20,000 years ago, the Cave of the Hands in Lascaux,
5537220	5547540	but in my experience, the vibrance and curiosity and revolutionary spirit often happens in cities
5547540	5554260	that have universities. And it's at a university that the mitochondria of something to replace the
5554340	5561700	superorganism may be born. And as stewards and chaperones of these young humans, I think you,
5562500	5570740	as professors, can breathe life into this new mitochondria. Last but not least, you are professors,
5570740	5577940	you are citizens, but you're also humans. And I'm going to finish with some recommendations
5577940	5583220	of how to take this all on board in your own life. First category is being. How do you be
5583940	5591220	during this time? First of all, it is totally normal to grieve of the future that we thought
5591220	5598420	existed, but now you're starting to understand that a different future lies ahead. And if you're
5598420	5604260	sad about this, it's totally normal. What's not normal is you're dismissive or laughed about this
5604260	5612100	or felt indifferent. Grieve is appropriate to what we face. So give yourself some time to reflect
5612100	5620020	on this. And by the way, don't believe me in what I'm saying this. Research for yourself and come
5620020	5625220	to your own conclusions. But even if you think I have a 10% chance of being right in what I've
5625220	5632020	said today, I hope you will integrate some of these ideas into your work. Remember to keep
5632020	5637860	perspective. If we're alive at the top of the carbon pulse, that seems like a really scary thing.
5637860	5644980	But what about the Inuits in Nunavut or the Yukon or up in the north of Canada? If you told them,
5645620	5650820	if you told a human, I'm going to set you out on a minus 50 degrees Celsius ice flow,
5650820	5655060	you would think that's a death sentence. But to the people living up there, it's just another
5655060	5662340	normal day. So we have to keep perspective of how much amazing opportunity we have. We have
5662420	5668340	access to all the information ever acquired by our species for free at our fingertips to give
5668340	5673860	one example. Don't forget to live. I forget this a lot because this is stressful toxic stuff that
5673860	5680580	I've chosen as my job to teach. But we have to live and love and play music and dance and play with
5680580	5688260	baby ducks and go on hikes and take naps and all the things that humans do. And not forget to have
5688260	5695540	gratitude every day for all the amazing things in this time that we have, these perilous risks,
5695540	5701940	but there's a lot to be grateful for. And I'm grateful for a lot in my life. We have to remember
5701940	5707380	that this is a marathon and not a sprint and to nourish our own bodies and souls and minds
5708260	5716820	with healthy food, with exercise, with timeouts. We have to heal our amygdala and our fight or
5716820	5724900	flight response of our reptilian system and pause and reflect and be healthy. I think in addition
5724900	5732180	to Goldilocks tech, inner tech is going to be a necessity, something I will benefit from myself.
5732180	5739700	I need to walk the talk before I really advise this, but we are faced with a smorgasbord of different
5740420	5747620	advice and opportunities and dopamine and consumption and travel. But really our culture
5747620	5752900	has shortened and shortened our attention spans and dopamine has become a predominant
5752900	5758980	neurotransmitter in our behaviors. And especially young people, they increasingly have lower
5758980	5764900	attention spans. They can't read a book. They can only watch short TikTok videos. And my advice,
5764900	5771060	especially to the young humans watching this, is to avoid the shallows and make sure to have dates
5771060	5778180	where you set technology aside, dates and windows and times, because your brain is your most important
5778180	5783300	asset going forward. And you want to have the attention span to be able to plant gardens
5783300	5789700	and read a book and do longer term projects. So the real asset allocation shift isn't necessarily
5790500	5797300	from money into real capital. It's also from our focus on dopamine into a more healthy portfolio
5797300	5804020	of neurotransmitters like serotonin, endorphins and oxytocin. Doing, what do we do with all this
5804020	5810100	information? Well, you simplify first and beat the rush. Most of the best things in life are free
5810100	5816020	after basic needs are met. And to simplify, if you really understand that society is not going to do
5816020	5822260	these things ahead of time, that gives you an interesting impulse on the back end because it
5822260	5828900	empowers you to do things now because you know that society probably won't. And to simplify your own
5828900	5838180	life and don't be reliant on a large house that's going to be a lot of money to heat or cool or a
5838180	5844580	boyfriend in Holland or any, well, if you really want a boyfriend in Holland, I'm not going to
5844580	5849620	gainsay you, but my point is that energy and money are going to become more expensive in the
5849620	5856740	not too distant future. Learn skills. You can imagine what skills are going to be needed in
5856740	5864740	coming decades. And a lot of us are neglecting physical skills because our culture is so rich
5864740	5870420	that we can outsource the skills to someone else. Ask yourself if half of what I'm saying comes to
5870420	5875380	pass. What is a skill that you could contribute to in your own community that you're kind of good
5875380	5880740	at and are interested in? Avoid the consensus trance. We are such social creatures that we
5880740	5887860	look to others to confirm what's true and have as academics, you're probably not as prone to this,
5889060	5895540	but avoid group think and what other people think you should do and think what is our reality
5895540	5901380	and come to your own conclusions. Intermittence. Humans don't need baseload energy. We are
5901380	5907940	baseload energy, so we get massive energy benefits from the first few of the 100
5909300	5918100	light bulbs we have invisibly behind us. The first few have sufficiency, and then there's enough,
5918100	5922740	and then there's plenty, and our current cultural goal is more and more and more stuff. So we have
5922740	5928820	to remember that we don't have a true resource scarcity, but rather a longage of expectations.
5928820	5934900	Carrying dissonance. Uncertainty is physically uncomfortable for humans, which is why people
5935540	5940260	tend to gravitate towards really polarized positions, because then they don't have to
5940260	5948660	devote any mental energy towards other what-ifs. So the natural response to a presentation like this,
5948660	5953780	if you haven't studied it, is, oh my gosh, technology will solve it. This is too Malthusian.
5953780	5958660	We'll figure something out. There's no problem. Or, oh my god, we're screwed. It's Mad Max.
5959620	5965380	But the reality is going to be in the middle, and we have to become more comfortable with
5965380	5974580	uncertainty and navigate the pathways between fantasy and doom. Find the others. This is a
5974580	5978900	scene from Lord of the Rings, and one of the reasons that I love the book, and many people love
5978900	5984820	the book, is the fellowship. The fact that these nine, they're not even people. They were
5984820	5991380	hobbits and men and dwarves, and they got together and shared an experience. We need to do the same
5991380	5997220	thing. We are on a runaway train where the market and the superorganism is shoveling fuel into the
5997220	6003540	engine car. So we need to meet with others in the dining car and have conversations about what
6003540	6010260	matters and work on things that we're passionate about, and just enjoy life with people and find
6010260	6018260	the others that are on the same moral, intellectual, educational pathway that you are.
6019540	6026180	Sharpen the sword. We have the agenda of the gene as biological organisms. We are a product of what
6026180	6031700	worked in the past. We're walking forward, but our eyes are looking backward. But we don't have to
6032340	6037940	follow the agenda of the gene. It is not our friend. So sharpening the sword is improving
6037940	6044020	yourself towards a direction that you care about and you're capable of, and sharpen the sword because
6044020	6051380	the sword is you. We are an intense comparing social species. We compare ourselves to others.
6051380	6057380	I talked about Tiger Woods and his wife's new boyfriend, but we do this all the time. We flex
6057380	6063140	and do other things just to raise our status. But we have to keep in mind that on an absolute
6063140	6069860	basis, the average person in North America is richer materially than kings and queens of old
6069860	6075700	from an energy and material standpoint. And yet, a lot of us feel like we're failing because we're
6075700	6083300	comparing ourselves to the advertisements on television. So consider the absolute wealth that
6083300	6089460	you have in the access to things that you have instead of comparing yourself all the time to
6089460	6098740	others. Lastly, being, doing, and we, we need to expand the definition of self to be commensurate
6098740	6108500	with our times. So one pro-social thing we can do is there is a autocorrelation with negative
6108580	6116420	sentiments and negative emotions and anger and distrust. One person smiling and changing the
6116420	6122180	behavior can break the chain of this. So don't be afraid to be kind and smile at strangers
6122180	6129460	and do unexpected behaviors of grace because you never know what sort of chain you're going to
6129460	6134820	disrupt and start a new chain in a new direction. We don't know what's going to happen in the future.
6134820	6141140	I think this presentation might have put some new walls on the probability distribution of what's
6141140	6146980	possible. But one suggestion I have is to wend your way towards something that you're passionate
6146980	6152740	about and care about. This is my good friend and colleague, DJ White, who ended up being the co-founder
6152740	6160660	of Greenpeace International and he ran Earth Trust. This is when he was 22. He was a geologist living
6160660	6168420	in Indiana and he didn't really know much about the world except he loved dolphins and whales.
6168420	6172500	But he determined there were no dolphins and whales in Indiana and he bought a one-way ticket to
6172500	6179220	Hawaii and volunteered cleaning dolphin poop out of aquariums. And within 15 years, he was the
6179220	6186900	single most effective environmental activist of our time. He stopped the drift nets in the oceans.
6186900	6194900	He did the Flipper dolphin safe tuna at Starkist. He stopped a dolphin drive kill in Taiwan
6194900	6200740	and many other success stories just because he took a step in a direction without a plan of
6200740	6207940	something he was passionate about. So I recommend that you wend yourself towards something that
6207940	6214580	you feel passionate about with a purpose. Towards that end, give yourself a 24-hour vacation from
6214580	6219700	other people and technology in a place you personally find meaningful and ask yourself,
6220260	6225940	who do I wish to be in this life? Why do I wish that? And how might that may be made real?
6225940	6235060	And the answers are for you alone, but you might be glad to have them. Intrinsic. We often get
6235060	6242740	validation externally for our behaviors and our self-worth, but given the stakes of everything
6242740	6248660	I've described today, we have to follow our own moral compass of what feels right and what feels
6248660	6255780	wrong and what feels rewarding and meaningful and follow a true north moral compass according to you,
6255780	6262340	not according to other people, and be intrinsically motivated. Do something for the benefit of someone
6262340	6269300	else that nobody else, including the person or animal or forest, will ever know. Examine closely
6269300	6275860	the complex feelings this causes to arise within you as a first step in sorting social motivation
6275860	6281780	from personal altruism, especially for the younger people. Rocks in the river metaphorically,
6281780	6288340	as the water starts rushing in our economic systems, many people who are not grounded are
6288340	6294980	going to metaphorically tumble downstream. And if you have resources and you are psychologically
6295940	6303140	sound and have a pro-social outlook, try to ground yourself as a large rock in the river of your
6303140	6308980	community that other people can rely on. And if enough people do this, we can actually not only
6308980	6315620	help our community and our university, but we can redirect the flow of the water. Maximize your
6315620	6320820	impact. Once we hear about climate change and all the negative things going on in the biosphere,
6320820	6327140	there's a tendency to try to be perfect and not eat meat and drive electric cars and not travel
6327140	6332660	and recycle. And the list gets endless. And I think that all those things are good personal
6332660	6338260	hygiene at these times. But I would much rather you, especially as universities in a wealthy
6338260	6344820	country of Canada, to take this opportunity to maximize your impact on the planet as opposed to
6344820	6351460	just being one eighth billionth of a slightly smaller part of a problem. So this is the list
6351460	6359060	of advice I have for you. I'll close with this quote from Ilia Priogen, an ecological economist.
6359060	6366260	When a system is far from equilibrium, small islands of coherence can shift the entire system.
6366260	6370260	Maybe some of those islands of coherence could be universities in Canada
6370260	6377460	as a mitochondria of a new cultural social system. Thank you all. So Kira, you
6378660	6383540	had no idea what I was going to say. You know my work. I hope this wasn't too much for your
6383540	6388980	colleagues in Canada. This is the longest talk I've ever given, but I do think it's important to see
6388980	6394100	the bird's eye picture. And we've got some time for some questions if you have any.
6395060	6401620	I have tons of questions, but I want to respect your time as well. One of the things that really
6401620	6406740	jumped out on me in this talk and some more recent talks I've heard you give is around this idea of
6406740	6412900	libraries of care. And why this is really salient, I think when I'm educating in this space, one of
6412900	6418180	the hardest things, hardest questions that I hear from students is what's the point? And that breaks
6418180	6423620	my heart in a million different directions. What's the point from the sense of like an apathy or a
6423620	6429060	system overload where they're witnessing the foreclosure of nature. They're seeing the horsemen
6429060	6434980	come in. They are watching war, live streaming war on their phones and they say, what's the point?
6434980	6439940	Or I can't do anything. Or on the flip side, they'll say something like, what's the point? Technology
6439940	6446660	will save us. And that is baked into this very short-sighted dopamine reward system that they're
6446660	6452340	working within. When you brought up the idea of libraries of care, I immediately thought, well,
6452340	6459700	the institution is this incredible library. We have many libraries on campus, but how can we
6459700	6464020	nurture a different kind of library? And what would that look like for healing and building
6464020	6470900	capacity and resilience that would really support the young people who will be alive much longer
6470900	6477540	than we will, who will be inheriting the mess we're giving them? I think you kind of answered
6477540	6483140	your own question. I mean, we need people organically to step up and say, this is what our
6483140	6490420	young humans need as part of a university of experience. There needs to be a feeling of community
6490420	6498260	that goes beyond competition for grades and getting a resume, but actually involves meditation
6498900	6511540	and cooking and singing and outdoor group activities. And I think the antidote to apathy
6511540	6518660	is finding other people in a community, because as I mentioned, I deal with this toxic stuff a
6518660	6527140	lot. And the thing that supports me and leads me away from apathy is the dozens and now hundreds
6527140	6533140	and growing to be more than that, people that have my back that I talk to about this and feel
6533140	6538900	as passionate about it as I do, and we're sharing ideas and working on projects, and we're rolling
6538900	6544740	up our sleeves. And doing it alone feels like what's the point, but doing it in a small group
6544740	6551140	as Margaret Mead said, it's small groups of humans are the only thing that can change the
6551140	6561460	planet. Or something she said, I forgot the exact words. But I think we need to heal our
6561460	6571220	reptilian and emotional systems as a precursor to the intellectual thing, because our cognitive
6571220	6580900	brain that perceives facts and studies for tests sits atop a much larger pyramid of things going on
6581380	6586980	that in our modern age, we're not that healthy or regulated, we're constantly in a
6588820	6595860	fight or flight mode and our amygdalas are activated. And so universities need to, I think,
6595860	6604820	and communities have to have places to go that aren't scarlet letters, stigma for people that
6604820	6609940	have, oh, they went to the mental health clinic. It's not like that. It's actually, this is where
6610020	6616020	I go to be human. It should be promoted. And I want to go there and be with these other humans,
6616020	6620340	because we're talking about all this stuff, and we're doing cool things and activities,
6620340	6627300	and we need to exercise and good food. And I don't know the university structure, the way it is now,
6627300	6631860	how to go from here to there. But something like that is sorely needed.
6632340	6640100	Hmm. Another thing that comes to mind is how can we widen our boundaries for imaginaries and
6640100	6646100	possibilities? We're working in these silos, literally the climate control, everything is
6646100	6652420	within these boxes. Do you have any ideas as an educator, as a communicator? Do you think getting
6652420	6658180	people outside, maybe outdoors? Is there anything you can think of that might be helpful there?
6658980	6664020	Well, first of all, ask what would nature do? Spend as much time in nature as you can.
6664900	6672980	It calms your nervous system. It grounds you. And living in Canada, you have plenty of access
6672980	6680260	to that that some people in the world don't. I think we need tangible examples. We need more
6680260	6688180	examples and pilots of people doing cool, interesting things. There's research shown that
6688180	6694420	if someone sees another person doing an act of altruism, they're 300% more likely to do
6694420	6700020	an altruistic thing themselves. So I think the problem with many of these lectures and these
6700020	6705620	concepts is they're all a bunch of scary facts. And then another to-do list of what to do in
6705620	6713220	your own life without tangible examples. But the people listening to this, we need to start doing
6713220	6719380	those tangible examples and promoting them and showing that life doesn't have to be a disaster
6719380	6727860	if we're using less energy and less stuff. And so I think just start by doing more things with
6727860	6736660	other people in the direction of a simplification. Very cool. And a question for Nate Hagins as a
6736660	6742100	human, not a communicator and an educator. But you know, I always like to ask you, what are the
6742100	6746340	coolest birds you've seen lately? And also, what is growing in your garden right now?
6748500	6755620	Well, I see a lot of birds. And as you know, I think I told you I have the Merlin
6756180	6763380	Cornell thing on my phone that identifies them. And yesterday and the day before, I identified a
6763380	6769540	black-billed cuckoo, which you can look it up. I've never seen one, but I hear it now,
6769540	6773700	two days in a row, and I'm trying to see it. And I looked it up online. And sure enough,
6773700	6778340	that is the sound that I'm hearing. I see pilliated woodpeckers every day.
6780020	6785540	I will give you an honest answer about my garden. My girlfriend is growing a lot of things, garlic,
6785620	6795060	and tomatoes, and onions, and spinach, and kale. I'm responsible for potatoes. And the potato
6795780	6800260	patch looks like the Tasmanian devil went through there, because I've been so freaking busy that
6800260	6805780	the weeds are larger than the potato plants. So I will be frequenting my farmer's market this fall.
6807540	6811700	But it is a failing of mine that I've been working too much this spring,
6811700	6821220	because not only is the produce itself yummy and rewarding in the fall, but it's the act of being
6821220	6831700	out in the soil with my birds, my chickens, and ducks, and guinea fowl, and dogs. So my garden
6831700	6837460	is not as it should be this year, Kira, but I endeavor to change that in the future.
6838340	6839860	Through a great simplification.
6843220	6849380	Well, it's a challenge, right? Because I know this is coming, and I'm trying to affect it with our
6849380	6856420	work of our channel and our communication. And in doing that, I've complexified my own life at
6856420	6861940	a same time that I know a simplification is coming. And I'm sure many people can relate to that.
6862900	6867380	But I have grown a wonderful garden in past years, so I at least have the skills.
6868660	6874900	And I can still cook this stuff. But to be totally blunt and honest, we were just talking about this
6874900	6881060	last week. Red Wing, Minnesota, where I live, has a huge farmer's market. And in September,
