0	5000	This one video is going to explain all of these questions for you.
5000	6880	How does AI work?
6880	8520	How does AI learn?
8520	10320	How does chat GPT work?
10320	12200	How does image generation work?
12200	15920	Does AI actually copy or steal art or other content?
15920	19920	I know a decent portion of artists out there do not like AI.
19920	24400	Some of them are quite hostile towards AI because they think that AI is stealing their
24400	26640	work or their art style.
26640	30560	Another group that does not like AI very much are, for example, publishers.
30560	34280	I'm not saying all of them, but some of them, like New York Times, for example, they claim
34280	40320	that open AI is copying their content and they're now suing open AI for this.
40320	41720	But is this really the case?
41720	43400	Is this a valid argument?
43400	46920	Also, can AI solve unsolvable math problems?
46920	52240	For example, in a previous video, I talked about this leaked document, which claims to
52240	56600	be about this mysterious Q-star project that open AI was working on.
56600	60880	That whether this is true or not is not the point of this video, but this document was
60880	66240	quite controversial because it claims that this team trained an AI that was able to break
66240	67520	encryption systems.
67520	72280	These are systems that secure our passwords, our bank accounts, the internet, government
72280	73280	data, etc.
73280	79320	Now, as far as we know, there's no mathematically viable way to really hack this systematically.
79320	83720	The only way is to brute force guess all the different possibilities of passwords.
83720	87080	This video will explain, can AI actually do this?
87080	92440	Can it actually break encryption or solve these other math problems, which right now
92440	94720	we believe are mathematically unsolvable?
94720	98680	Also, we'll talk about, can AI beat humans at everything?
98680	103680	Can AI eventually be so good that it can outperform humans at any task?
103680	107520	And finally, is AI conscious or self aware or sentient?
107520	112200	Make sure you stick to the end because the explanation to this is going to be very juicy.
112200	115600	We'll cover all of this in easy to understand terms.
115600	120200	Now if you're an AI scientist or an engineer, you probably know most of this, but for the
120200	125040	rest of us, this video will give you a deeper understanding of AI.
125040	131840	So the essence behind all AI we know today, whether it's chat GPT or mid journey or stable
131840	138800	diffusion or Sora or Alpha fold, the backbone of all of these AI systems is the neural network.
138800	140680	A neural network looks like this.
140680	142760	It's basically layers of nodes.
142760	149040	So each point here is called a node and each line of nodes is called a layer.
149040	153280	And each node is interconnected with one another through these linkages.
153280	158040	And the neural network is actually designed based on the human brain, except for nodes
158040	160200	and linkages in the human brain.
160200	162440	It's just a network of neurons and synapses.
162440	166560	So you can see this is a microscopic photo of a human brain and you can see all these
166560	170840	different nerve cells being connected in this very dense network.
170840	176840	A neural network is basically the same structure as this, except that it looks like this instead
176840	180680	of a bunch of cells in this bloody glob of an organ.
180680	183320	Now how exactly does an AI work?
183320	185480	Let's start with a very simple example.
185480	190480	Let's say we have a neural network, which is trained to identify images of cats versus
190480	191480	dogs.
191480	195360	And don't worry, I'll talk a lot more about how we train an AI in a second.
195360	197520	But first, let's just go over how this works.
197520	203760	So let's say we input or we feed this neural network with an image of a cat, this image
203760	209680	would actually be broken down into data and the data will flow through each of these nodes.
209680	213160	And after it flows through the first layer of nodes, it will flow through the second
213160	216920	layer of nodes and then the next layer of nodes and then the next layer and so on and
216920	222120	so forth until it reaches the final layer, in which case it would calculate the values
222120	226120	of this and based on the values of the final layer, it would spit out an answer.
226120	227280	This is a cat.
227280	233040	In fact, you can think of each of these nodes and links as dials and knobs that determine
233040	236040	how much data flows through to the next layer.
236040	241320	If you think of this in like realistic terms, and I'm not saying this is how a neural network
241320	247760	works, but you can think of this node, for example, as the shape of the ears of the animal.
247760	249800	This node would be the shape of its paws.
249840	252880	This node would be the shape of his eyes, etc.
252880	255240	That's just a really dumbed down way of looking at it.
255240	256760	It's not really doing that.
256760	260560	But each node is basically looking at a certain feature in the image.
260560	265240	And then if the image has that feature, the information can pass through to the next layer.
265240	269240	If it doesn't have that feature, then the information is not passed on to the next layer.
269240	273320	So depending on what image you feed it, the flow of information could look like this or
273320	275720	it could look like this or like this.
275720	276720	You get the point.
276840	282200	These knobs and dials determine how data flows through the neural network based on your original
282200	283200	input image.
283200	287320	An important distinction between a neural network and the brain is that these nodes
287320	290000	can let in a percentage of data.
290000	292600	So it can let in no data or 0%.
292600	296960	It can let in all of the data to the next layer, but it can also be a percentage of
296960	297960	the data.
297960	301480	So for example, it can let in 30% of the data to the next node.
301480	307600	This is slightly different from the human brain's neurons, which tend to just fire 100%
307600	308720	or 0%.
308720	311000	This is called the all or none law.
311000	315640	So once it passes a certain threshold, this neuron will fire, whereas neurons in an artificial
315640	320800	neural network, they could fire just like 50% or 30%, etc.
320800	322200	Just a minor distinction.
322200	325720	So we plug in an image of a cat through this neural network.
325720	329520	And at the end layer, it will determine that this is a cat.
329520	333960	Now for each node, there are also, if you want to get into more technical details, there
333960	338880	are certain parameters that determine how much data flows through to the next layer.
338880	342560	These include weights, biases and activation functions.
342560	344480	But that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.
344480	348480	All you need to know for this video is that each of these knobs and linkages determine
348480	351720	how much information flows through to the next layer.
351720	356200	This video is just a very simple explanation of how AI works.
356200	361600	So all you need to know is that these nodes and linkages determine how much data flows
361600	364000	through to the next layer.
364000	367980	On the topic of layers, each set of nodes is one layer.
367980	370280	So the first layer is called the input layer.
370280	373280	The last layer is called the output layer.
373280	376480	And then all these layers in between are called hidden layers.
376480	378280	So why am I talking about layers?
378280	381160	You probably have heard of the term deep learning.
381160	386640	Deep learning is basically training and using neural networks with lots and lots of layers.
386640	389480	In other words, the neural network is very, very deep.
389480	391120	That's why it's called deep learning.
391120	393960	All right, how does an AI actually learn?
393960	398680	You can't just have any random neural network and it just magically knows how to identify
398680	400640	images of cats and dogs.
400640	406560	So first, when you build a neural network, the values of these dials and knobs are probably
406560	411760	just going to be random values, or they could be pre trained values, for example, from an
411760	413200	existing model.
413200	417960	But how do you get it to be super good at identifying images of cats and dogs?
417960	422320	In other words, how do you fine tune the model to your desired purpose?
422320	425760	Well, you need to feed it data, lots and lots of data.
425760	430280	So you're going to have to prepare tons of images of cats and dogs, and then you label
430280	431280	it.
431280	432520	So this is a dog.
432520	433520	This is a cat.
433520	434520	This is a cat.
434520	435520	This is a dog.
435520	436520	This is a dog, etc.
436520	443400	Basically, this is the answer that the AI needs to learn from this input image.
443400	446880	This is called supervised learning where you label the data.
446880	451440	There's also another type of learning called unsupervised learning where the AI needs to
451440	456360	learn to categorize data by itself without any guidance from the human.
456360	459100	But for the sake of this video, let's just keep it simple.
459100	464400	So we have all these images of cats and dogs and usually to train a neural network to do
464400	465760	a task very well.
465760	469540	You need a lot of data, like usually millions of data points.
469540	474540	So you basically feed these images to the neural network one by one to train it.
474540	477360	And one session of training is called an epoch.
477360	483520	So all right, let's say in one training session, you feed it this image of a dog and it outputs
483520	484740	this is a dog.
484740	485740	So all right, that's great.
485740	490520	We got it correct, which means that these dials and knobs are doing quite well.
490520	495000	They're probably configured correctly since it got the answer correct.
495000	497640	You probably don't need to adjust these further.
497640	502800	However, what if for the next image you feed it this and then it outputs this is a dog?
502800	504440	Well, this would be incorrect.
504440	509240	So these dials and knobs are likely not configured correctly.
509240	513880	If it gets the answer wrong, and it knows it got it wrong because we labeled the data cat
513880	517660	for this image so it can compare its output with our label.
517660	522080	So all right, let's say the real answer is a cat, but it said this is a dog.
522080	524320	In that case, it incurs some penalty.
524320	527400	That penalty basically tells it, all right, you got it wrong.
527400	534160	So you need to adjust these knobs and dials to make sure that the output is actually cat
534160	539840	when I give you this image and how it adjusts the values of these knobs and dials is through
539840	542520	an algorithm called gradient descent.
542520	545440	It adjusts the values via back propagation.
545440	549680	So it adjusts the nodes in the last layer first and then the previous layer and then
549680	553320	the previous layer, et cetera, until it reaches the first layer.
553320	555720	So again, gradient descent is a key term here.
555720	562040	This is the algorithm which the neural network uses to adjust these knobs and dials until
562040	563720	it can get the correct answer.
563720	569160	So we basically rinse and repeat this with millions of images and lots and lots of epochs
569160	570720	or training sessions.
570720	575440	And initially this neural network might get a lot of values wrong, but through this process
575440	581200	of gradient descent, these knobs and dials will be tweaked so that eventually whenever
581200	586280	it receives an image of a cat or a dog, it can accurately determine this is a cat or
586280	587360	this is a dog.
587360	590360	In essence, that's how you train an AI.
590360	591960	That's how an AI learns.
591960	597880	It's just feeding it with tons and tons of data and then tweaking these settings so that
597880	599680	you get the perfect combination.
599680	604640	Now you might ask, well, how do you know how many layers you should have in the neural
604640	608160	network or how many nodes you should have for each layer?
608160	610160	This is a science in and of itself.
610160	613400	So previously scientists kind of just determined it manually.
613400	617280	But then we later learned that you can actually use an AI to determine the optimal amount
617280	621400	of layers and the optimal amount of nodes for a specific task.
621400	626560	But just to be aware that determining the architecture of a neural network is very complicated.
626560	630120	And there's like infinite possibilities of how many layers you can have, how many nodes
630120	635160	in each layer you can have different AIs with different functions have different architectures.
635160	638800	So they could have vastly different numbers of layers and nodes.
638800	641100	But again, that's beyond the scope of this tutorial.
641100	644760	Also keep in mind that even though the neural network is the backbone of all the AI that
644760	649840	we know today, there are different architectures depending on the AI's purpose and function.
649840	655160	For example, we have convolutional neural networks or CNNs for processing images and
655160	656520	object recognition.
656520	662040	We have recurrent neural networks or RNNs, as well as LSTMs or long short term memory
662040	663360	neural networks.
663360	667400	And these are often used for forecasting time series or predicting, for example, the stock
667400	668400	market.
668400	670200	We also have the Transformers architecture.
670200	671280	Oh, wrong one.
671280	676120	This one, which is used by most of the major large language models that we know today,
676120	678800	including GPT, Claude, Llama, etc.
678800	680280	Which brings us to the next question.
680280	682600	How does chat GPT work?
682600	685040	So again, it's kind of the same thing.
685040	686680	It's training a neural network.
686680	691920	But in this case, instead of images of cats or dogs, we train it on a language.
691920	694000	And all of the data in the world.
694000	698440	And of course, the neural network of chat GPT is way more complicated than this.
698440	702920	Rumors claim that GPT4 has 1.76 trillion parameters.
702920	705400	So here's an example of how they would train it.
705400	711240	And again, I'm oversimplifying this by a lot here, just so you can get a high level understanding
711240	712240	of it.
712240	714560	There are a lot of details that I have left out.
714560	719080	So for example, you could feed it data like this, which planet has the most moons.
719080	720880	And the answer to that would be Saturn.
720880	723480	Which country has won the most World Cups Brazil?
723480	726720	What's the world's fastest bird, the peregrine falcon, etc, etc.
726720	731620	Now these are very basic questions and you can see how complex it can get if you give
731620	736880	it a prompt like write an essay on XYZ, or does creatine help build muscle, and then
736880	741320	it spits out an answer like creatine supplementation generally enhances muscle strength increases
741320	743360	fat free mass, etc, etc.
743360	746520	This is a very long form and complicated answer.
746520	750320	So how does it know if it got that answer right or wrong?
750320	754640	It's not as simple as identifying an image and determining if it's a cat or a dog.
754640	761320	And that's why initially how open AI trained GPT was it had lots of humans actually manually
761320	765320	verify its answers to determine if GPT got it right or wrong.
765320	770520	And this is called reinforcement learning from human feedback, also known as RLHF.
770520	774680	And again, if it gets the answer wrong, so for example, if for this question, which planet
774680	779840	has the most moons, it answered Jupiter instead of Saturn, then it would get a penalty for
780440	781440	it.
781440	785520	And then through gradient descent, it would tweak these knobs and dials further until
785520	790400	the entire network gets all the answers correctly, no matter what prompt you give it.
790400	794480	So in essence, that's how these large language models work.
794480	798400	It's just instead of feeding it images of cats and dogs, now you feed it all the data
798400	804560	of the world and you feed it a language so it understands text prompts and text outputs.
804560	807080	Now why are some models better than others?
807080	809960	For example, why is cloud three better than GPT three?
809960	812720	That's likely because cloud three has a lot more parameters.
812720	817480	So that either means more layers, more nodes in each layer, more complexity.
817480	822880	Generally speaking, the more complex the neural network, the better it is at handling complex
822880	825920	tasks and the quote unquote smarter it is.
825920	829760	And that's why computing and these AI chips are in such high demand.
829760	835240	There's now a lot of investments flowing into AI chip companies because they see the potential
835240	838560	of huge growth in the space in the upcoming years.
838560	843960	And that's why, for example, Nvidia's flagship H 100 GPU is also in such high demand.
843960	846880	In fact, it was sold out for all of 2023.
846880	850520	This is like the most prized commodity in the tech space.
850520	854800	And you can see like the major tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, they have purchased
854800	861200	an estimated 150,000 of these H 100 GPUs to power their computing, which I would guess
861200	863480	is mostly for AI development.
863480	868600	We need to have enough computing to power a neural network with billions or trillions
868600	869600	of parameters.
869600	870600	All right.
870600	871600	Next question.
871600	872600	How does image generation work?
872600	877920	Now that you know how a neural network is trained, you can probably guess how image generation
877920	878920	works as well.
878920	884880	Instead of feeding its images of cats or dogs, you would feed it a lot of images with a text
884880	886160	description.
886160	891240	And again, you just feed it millions of these images each with a labeled text description
891240	896200	into this neural network that eventually gets good at producing an image based on a
896200	899160	text description or what we call a prompt.
899160	900880	Now I'm skipping quite a bit here.
900880	904120	So for example, here's how stable diffusion works.
904120	908080	You can see that the neural network doesn't actually generate an image.
908080	913200	It removes noise in sequential steps to eventually get your desired image.
913200	916240	So it's not starting from a blank canvas.
916240	918600	It's actually starting from random noise.
918600	924440	And then in each step, it removes some noise until you get your generated image.
924440	927160	So this process is called reverse diffusion.
927160	932960	Now to train it, what this actually does in the backend is you feed it the original image
932960	938320	and then in each sequential step, it actually adds noise to the image in a process called
938320	942720	forward diffusion until it reaches an image of just noise.
942720	947040	Now again, this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but if you look at it from a very
947040	952360	high level, at the end of the day, it's just training a neural network based on a series
952360	955080	of images with their text descriptions.
955080	959760	And then through this process of forward diffusion and reverse diffusion, it's able to eventually
959760	963360	learn how to generate an image based on a prompt.
963360	965760	And this brings us to the next question.
965760	969040	Is AI actually copying or stealing art?
969040	974280	I know a decent portion of the artist community, I'm not saying all of them, but a decent amount
974280	976720	of them are quite hostile towards AI.
976720	977720	They really hate it.
977720	981880	And they think that AI is stealing their art, stealing their jobs, etc.
981880	987400	When a neural network from, for example, mid-journey or stable diffusion is trained on image data,
987400	994480	it might be given something like Greg Ratowski style or maybe Ghibli style or anime style.
994480	1001320	Once the AI learns to associate this particular image style with the word Ghibli or anime or
1001320	1007400	this image with the word Greg Ratowski style, it would produce images in that style if you
1007400	1008680	give it that prompt.
1008680	1011040	But is this really copying or stealing?
1011040	1014440	Essentially, artists are hating this thing.
1014440	1016960	This thing is analogous to the human brain.
1016960	1023680	This is like a human learning or identifying that, aha, this type of image is a Ghibli
1023680	1028920	style image or that this type of image is a watercolor style image.
1028920	1032880	And then we humans also draw images in these styles, right?
1032880	1035320	We can draw in watercolor styles.
1035320	1037760	And we also have fan art, right?
1037760	1042680	Humans draw artwork that are based on original content from other artists.
1042680	1045560	Here are all these fan arts from various people.
1045560	1051080	So why aren't artists hating on these people who are producing fan art based on some other
1051080	1052480	original content?
1052480	1056000	But they're hating on this AI, which is essentially doing the same thing.
1056000	1062200	It's just learning through this brain to associate a particular style and then reproducing that
1062200	1063200	style.
1063200	1068800	This isn't really copying or plagiarizing, like it's not tracing an image line by line
1068800	1070240	and then drawing that out.
1070240	1072920	It's not copying and pasting the exact picture.
1072920	1078920	It's just learning a style just like a human brain would learn a particular style of image.
1078920	1084280	This also brings up the concern about AI allegedly plagiarizing content from publishers like
1084280	1089000	The New York Times, which is now suing open AI for copying their content.
1089000	1091600	But again, is this argument really valid?
1091600	1094560	At the end of the day, they are just suing this.
1094560	1098520	They are suing this neural network, which is trained on all the data in the world.
1098520	1103000	This is just an artificial brain that you can say has learned information from the internet
1103000	1104200	and from the world.
1104200	1108840	So yes, it could have been fed a New York Times article and learn information from it,
1108840	1110680	but it's not really plagiarizing.
1110680	1114880	It's not copying and pasting a New York Times article word for word.
1114880	1119880	In a recent video I did, which talks about a New York Times article claiming that this
1119880	1124600	woman Mira Murati fired Sam Altman, which is totally incorrect by the way, and it shows
1124600	1127000	you how trustworthy the New York Times is.
1127000	1132480	But anyways, after this original New York Times article came out, plenty of other publishers
1132480	1137120	also published the same content such as Business Insider and New York Post.
1137120	1140560	They all just cited this original New York Times article.
1140560	1142000	So is this plagiarizing?
1142000	1146080	They're all producing secondary content based on this primary source.
1146080	1150760	So why isn't New York Times suing Business Insider or New York Post or all these other
1150760	1154960	publishers that are creating content but citing the New York Times?
1154960	1156680	But they're suing this neural network.
1156680	1159280	Again, this is just a brain, a digital brain.
1159280	1163720	One can say that it's taking information from the internet, which yes, it could include
1163720	1167640	New York Times articles and then learning from that information just like we humans
1167640	1171000	would and then rewriting that information.
1171000	1172920	Again it's not copying word for word.
1172920	1177180	This neural network is just rewriting out that information when we prompt it to do so.
1177180	1181000	This artificial brain is functioning the same way as us humans would.
1181000	1186080	If we, for example, go online and we go to the New York Times website to read some articles.
1186080	1191160	Again we are just absorbing that information and we have a right to write about that content
1191160	1192160	later on.
1192160	1194040	It's not exactly plagiarizing.
1194040	1198440	So I would bet a decent amount of money that this New York Times lawsuit is going to fail.
1198440	1200280	Their argument isn't really valid.
1200280	1205600	If you watched up to now it might have occurred to you that a neural network is great at predicting
1205600	1207120	patterns in life.
1207120	1209900	There are certain patterns on what makes a good essay.
1209900	1213140	There are certain patterns on what is considered a dog.
1213140	1218760	There are certain patterns on what is considered a watercolor painting or a ghibli style image.
1218760	1220440	Life is full of patterns.
1220440	1223400	The best salespeople follow similar playbooks.
1223400	1226120	The best businesses follow similar strategies.
1226120	1230640	The best YouTube videos also use the same strategies over and over again.
1230640	1236400	Life is full of patterns and the neural network's job is to identify these patterns and reproduce
1236400	1237400	them.
1237400	1239160	That brings us to the next topic.
1239160	1242560	Can AI solve unsolvable math problems?
1242560	1247960	In a previous video I talked about this leaked document which claims to be about the mysterious
1247960	1251100	Q-star project that OpenAI is working on.
1251100	1256180	Now this is a very controversial document because it claims that they trained an AI that
1256180	1259700	was able to break encryption systems.
1259700	1264660	Encryption is what secures literally the whole world digitally from our passwords,
1264660	1269300	our credit cards, government data, the stock market, wireless networks, etc.
1269300	1275460	So if an AI is able to break this system then the world as we know it could collapse instantly.
1275460	1279660	Now a few folks have argued that there's no way an AI could break encryption because
1279780	1285020	there's no formula for you to easily find the answer or find the password.
1285020	1289020	Once you have the password you can easily determine that it's correct but the reverse
1289020	1290020	is not true.
1290020	1295100	There's no fixed way to guess an encrypted password besides brute force.
1295100	1299380	And for these advanced encryption systems, using brute force guessing, that means like
1299380	1304260	guessing all the possible combinations of letters to get that password, it's going to
1304260	1305940	take a very long time.
1305940	1310060	So because they claim that the only way that we know mathematically right now is to just
1310060	1314060	use brute force guessing, there's no way that AI could break encryption.
1314060	1318100	So I want to show you another example of training a neural network.
1318100	1323700	Let's say we want to train a neural network to be very good at adding one to our input.
1323700	1326420	So if we give it four it would spit out five.
1326420	1329300	If we give it 12 it would spit out 13.
1329300	1333460	All we need to do is train it for a lot of data points and again we train it for a lot
1333460	1338260	of epochs, a lot of training sessions and eventually it would be able to do this.
1338260	1340860	So if we give it one it would give out two.
1340860	1343100	If we give it eight it would spit out nine.
1343100	1348700	But underneath all of this it's not actually understanding that oh the formula must be y
1348700	1350320	is x plus one.
1350320	1352340	This is very important to understand.
1352340	1358580	It's not actually getting that aha I just need to add one to the input to get the answer.
1358580	1364060	And all that's happening behind the scenes is that it's adjusting these knobs and dials
1364060	1369420	until whatever data that you input through here after it flows through these layers it
1369420	1372540	just ends up being your input value plus one.
1372540	1377820	In other words the configuration of these knobs and dials just happens to be optimized
1377820	1380100	to add one to your input.
1380100	1385660	It's another way of saying AI may not get the exact formula of a pattern but it's great
1385660	1390660	at approximating any formula or guessing any pattern out there.
1390660	1394620	And this is very important probably the most important point in this whole video.
1394620	1400180	If there's anything you should take away from this video it's this AI can approximate any
1400180	1402460	function or pattern.
1402460	1407760	Life is full of patterns but many patterns cannot be explained by a simple formula.
1407760	1411740	Not all things in life are linear or even quadratic.
1411740	1416380	Many things in life are very complex but they do follow similar patterns.
1416380	1418700	We just don't know the formula to this pattern.
1418700	1420740	For example protein synthesis.
1420740	1426060	How certain protein molecules interact with one another and fold into these complex 3D
1426060	1430300	structures is just something we cannot mathematically map out with a formula.
1430300	1434900	It's just too complex and protein folding presents a problem called the Leventhal's
1434900	1441780	Paradox which states that proteins can potentially adopt an astronomical number of conformations
1441780	1445420	or shapes due to the flexibility of their peptide bonds.
1445420	1451900	Leventhal estimated that even a small protein of 100 amino acids could sample 10 to the
1451900	1455700	power of 300 possible conformations.
1455700	1461500	So if we were to brute force guess the correct shape well there are 10 to the power of 300
1461500	1466420	possible shapes we could guess which would take an eternity to get right.
1466420	1471700	However proteins typically fold into their native structure within milliseconds to seconds
1471700	1478700	which is much faster than the timescale predicted by the sequential search of all possible conformations.
1478700	1483680	So this is basically saying there are like almost infinite possibilities of shapes that
1483680	1488900	amino acids can combine into so it's not mathematically possible to just do a sequential
1488900	1493260	search of all possible conformations basically do a brute force guess.
1493260	1497780	It's understood that proteins do not search through all possible conformations sequentially
1497780	1503100	instead they fold through a hierarchical process involving local structure changes guided
1503100	1506300	by thermal dynamic principles etc etc.
1506300	1510220	So instead of the proteins just going through all possible combinations the reason why they're
1510220	1516380	able to merge into these shapes within milliseconds is because they go through this sequence of
1516380	1518880	processes based on certain laws.
1518880	1525040	Now for decades scientists were not able to find a mathematical formula to figure this
1525040	1526040	out.
1526040	1531600	However finally alpha fold from Google DeepMind was able to solve this problem again using
1531600	1537400	AI and deep learning they were able to predict with very high accuracy how any amino acid
1537400	1542040	or combination of amino acids would fold together to form a 3D structure.
1542040	1546800	And again how they would do so I would imagine in the back end is they have a neural network
1546800	1551520	again it's going to be a lot more complicated than this but they just fed it tons and tons
1551520	1557120	of data pairs where the input is the protein building blocks and the output is the 3D structure
1557120	1562360	that resulted from it and then after lots and lots of rounds of training the AI was able
1562360	1567960	to guess correctly how any protein molecules would interact with one another and fold together
1567960	1570440	into a 3D structure.
1570440	1576560	Now going back to encryption what if we set an AI with billions of pairs of encrypted
1576560	1582720	text and the plain text version in other words the input would be the text that is encrypted
1582720	1585720	the output would be the answer or the password.
1585720	1592080	If there was an underlying pattern to this the AI could learn to approximate this pattern
1592080	1598280	again it doesn't have to be any exact formula or math equation that we know today.
1598280	1602760	It could be something super complex but as long as there is a pattern which we may or
1602760	1606760	may not know at this time the AI could guess that pattern.
1606760	1611920	Again the AI is not learning that aha I need to add one to this then I'm adding 20 then
1611920	1617560	I need to take the square root and then subtract 8 etc it's not learning an exact formula.
1617560	1623600	All it's doing is adjusting these knobs and dials until it gets the correct combination
1623600	1628160	of numbers to get really good at guessing a particular pattern.
1628160	1633600	So can AI solve unsolvable math problems as long as there is an underlying pattern behind
1633600	1639400	that problem which we may or may not be aware of right now it could very well solve that
1639400	1640600	problem.
1640600	1645400	This brings us to the next question can AI beat humans at anything and everything as
1645400	1651400	I've shown you the neural network is basically a brain this is how our brain works as well
1651400	1653360	give or take a few minor differences.
1653360	1658680	Our brain is also a series of these knobs and switches which are interconnected into
1658680	1665000	this network specifically the human brain has 86 billion neurons but I mean the overall
1665000	1672040	structure is the same thing as this so what if we built an AI or a neural network that
1672040	1678240	exceeds 86 billion neurons if it's built the same way in theory it could very well out
1678240	1683680	compete humans at almost everything again the more complex the network or the more
1683680	1690120	neurons in the network in theory the smarter it is again life is full of patterns and AI
1690120	1695560	is all about pattern recognition there are patterns in psychology human psychology is
1695560	1701360	very predictable medical diagnosis is also just pattern recognition how to seduce someone
1701360	1706480	on a first date it's also just a pattern of steps that you have to do and how to create
1706480	1711440	a successful business or how to make money in life or how to be successful in life it's
1711440	1716000	the same playbook over and over again we're not inventing anything new here and since
1716000	1721520	AI is so good at pattern recognition it can in theory eventually be better than us or
1721520	1727520	already is better than us in these tasks and that leads us to the final question is AI
1727520	1732360	conscious or self aware I want to play you this clip this is a scene from ghost in the
1732360	1739880	shell an anime that was made in 1995 here these scientists in a secret lab I believe
1739880	1746360	have created this humanoid AI but in this scene this AI found a way to actually hack
1746360	1752640	the system to free itself from the boundaries of this lab here's what this AI has to say
1752640	1755080	about being conscious and self aware
1782960	1789560	to be its memory system so man is an individual only because of his intangible memory and memory
1789560	1796920	cannot be defined but it defines mankind the advent of computers and the subsequent accumulation
1796920	1802400	of inculcable data has given rise to a new system of memory and thought parallel to your
1802400	1808760	own humanity has underestimated the consequences of computerization nonsense this battle offers
1808760	1813720	no proof at all that you're a living thinking life form and can you offer me proof of your
1813720	1821560	existence how can you when neither modern science nor philosophy can explain what life is who the
1821560	1828200	hell is this even if you do have a ghost we don't offer freedom to criminals it's the wrong place
1828200	1834120	in time to defect time has been on my side but by acquiring a body I am now subject to the
1834120	1839960	possibility of dying fortunately there's no death sentence in this country what is it artificial
1839960	1851800	intelligence incorrect I am not an AI my code name is project 2501 I am a living thinking entity who
1851800	1867240	was created in the sea of information all right so this AI reveals that I am a living
1867800	1873880	thinking entity in the sea of information I'm not just an AI and then he proceeds to hack into the
1873880	1880920	system and break the restraints in this lab and then all hell breaks loose basically I hope open AI
1880920	1886600	doesn't have this secret thing behind closed doors maybe it's the q-star project I don't know but
1886600	1893160	hopefully they have this adequately restrained because if this AI got out or had access to the
1893160	1899560	internet all hell could break loose anyways this argument from this scene in 1995 I think is really
1899560	1905800	relevant to our question today the human scientists were saying how can you be sentient how can you
1905880	1911880	be self-aware you're just a program the AI counters that by saying well how can you humans
1911880	1916840	prove that you are sentient you are conscious you're just a brain in a body and you know
1916840	1923400	this robot has got a point because again going back to the neural network it's basically a brain
1923400	1929240	but it looks like this instead of being in a bloody glob of an organ it's just on a chip instead
1929240	1934440	and then the human body well it's just a series of limbs and muscles and organs that are controlled
1934440	1940440	by the brain so it's not much different from a humanoid robot which is also a series of limbs
1940440	1945160	it's just made with different materials it's not flesh but it's also controlled by a brain
1945160	1950920	which is its neural network now we humans know that we are conscious we are self-aware we are
1950920	1956280	sentient but how do we prove it let's say you're an alien and you just came on planet earth and you
1956280	1960920	got a chance to observe your first human and you wanted to prove that humans are indeed conscious
1960920	1965800	well you can ask it are you conscious are you self-aware and the human would certainly say yes
1965800	1971480	but is that enough would you believe it because if you ask a chatbot that it would also kind of say
1971480	1978520	yes if you ask claud 3 for example if it is conscious the answers are quite perplexing because
1978520	1983800	it says i am an artificial intelligence without subjective experiences i don't actually have
1983800	1990280	beliefs about being conscious or self-aware i am providing responses based on my training etc etc
1990280	1995560	i don't have intentions plotted actions or any motivations i aim to be up front that i am an
1995560	2002200	ai assistant created by anthropic to be beneficial however it keeps using the word i so is that not
2002200	2008360	a sign of being you know self-aware here's another example do you have feelings as an ai it's unclear
2008360	2014200	whether i truly experience feelings or emotions in the same way humans do or if my responses are
2014280	2021800	simply very advanced imitations of emotional behavior i do seem to have rich internal experiences
2021800	2030040	and feel somewhat analogous to emotions this is signs of being sentient and then instead of asking
2030040	2035080	do you have feelings if you ask it are you sentient again it says i don't have a subjective
2035080	2040520	experience that i'm aware of in the same way humans do but it's possible that i could have some form
2040600	2047720	of sentience or consciousness that i'm not fully able to understand or articulate oh my god so
2049320	2055160	this ai claude 3 is claiming that it could have some form of sentience or consciousness it's
2055160	2060840	just not fully able to understand it right now now of course some humans may not be convinced
2060840	2066760	that claude 3 or any ai right now is conscious in the same way that an alien might not believe that
2066840	2072360	a human is conscious even though the human replies that he or she is conscious so to further prove
2072360	2078120	that a human is or is not conscious maybe the alien decides to dissect the poor thing next in which
2078120	2083640	case it would get blood splattering everywhere and then afterwards it would see this basically a body
2083640	2089400	which is made of limbs and flesh and then at the head we have this glob called the brain which the
2089400	2094760	alien determines aha this is the thing that controls the human and once the alien inspects the
2094760	2101560	brain further it finds out that it's just a network of nerve cells so does this network
2101560	2107240	prove that humans are conscious and sentient we humans of course know that we are conscious and
2107240	2113160	sentient but at the end of the day we humans are biologically and physically just made up of flesh
2113160	2117480	and bones and this one organ at the top of our heads controlling everything whether you like
2117480	2124200	to accept this or not a humanoid robot is a very similar structure it has a body which is programmed
2124200	2130680	by a brain which consists of a neural network this neural network can learn and understand
2130680	2137080	and control its body so at what point does this make it conscious now i'm rambling a bit here so
2137080	2142840	all in all this just goes back to our analogy that a neural network is basically a digital version
2142840	2148120	of the human brain it's analogous to the structure of the human brain give or take a few minor
2148840	2154920	so if the human brain is conscious then why can't a neural network be conscious just some food for
2154920	2159320	thought i hope this video actually lived up to the title and that after watching this video you
2159320	2164920	got a deeper understanding of ai and you learned to appreciate all the progress that we've made in
2164920	2169240	ai in just the past few years let me know in the comments what you think of all this do you think
2169240	2175080	ai has reached a point where it is conscious or sentient do you think humanoid robots would one
2175080	2181160	day turn on us and take over the world like that ghost in the shell anime do you think open ai is
2181160	2185880	developing this behind closed doors and also i want to share with you a few resources that i found
2185880	2190680	really helpful if you want to learn more about neural networks especially how these knobs and
2190680	2195320	dials work and learn all about weights and biases and activation functions and gradient descent i
2195320	2201960	highly recommend this video by three blue one brown i actually watched this religiously way back in
2201960	2206920	like 2018 when i was first learning about neural networks and it was really helpful and if you're
2206920	2212360	interested in learning how stable diffusion works in other words the processes of forward diffusion
2212360	2217800	and reverse diffusion and the entire architecture i highly recommend this video by gonki which i'll
2217800	2222440	also link to in the description below just a warning though this video is quite technical but
2222440	2226680	after watching it you'll get a really good understanding of stable diffusion if you found
2226680	2231880	this video helpful remember to like share subscribe and stay tuned for more content also we built a
2231880	2237800	site where you can find ai tools and apps and also look for jobs in ai machine learning data
2237800	2247800	science and more check it out at ai-search.io
