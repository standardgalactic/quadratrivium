Checking The known unknown/social media makes us unsocial.txt
The speaker, Jay, is addressing an audience in an assembly hall about the impact of social media on modern society. He notes that while the hall appears quiet, it's actually filled with people engaged with others through their phones rather than conversing face-to-face. Social media has profoundly changed how we interact, allowing us to share our concerns with distant friends instead of those nearby. This obsession with social networking platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and others is leading to a decline in real-life interactions with family and loved ones.

Jay poses a question: Have people ever engaged in meaningful conversation with a street newspaper vendor or a fast-food worker? The answer is likely no, as our focus has shifted to our phones, which have become an integral part of our lives. We cling to them even when we're physically with others, waiting for a digital interaction to take precedence over real-world connections.

Social media has also eroded trust, making us more suspicious of those we can see and interact with in person, and more trusting of those we only know online. Jay encourages viewers to reflect on their use of social media, suggesting that it's important to value and prioritize real human connections over digital ones. He invites the audience to like, share, and subscribe if they find the message resonant.
