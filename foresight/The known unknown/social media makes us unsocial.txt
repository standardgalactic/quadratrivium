Walking in an assembly hall and it was all quiet not because people over there were not talking with each other
But because they were talking with others over their phone
Hello everybody today. I am Jay is going to share my views on a topic social media
Living in the 24th century where technology has become universal safety blanket
It has become very important for us to understand some of its internal parts and one such part of this technology is
social media
The modern society has become more and more obsessed with this technology in the form of PCs
tablets
Smartphones and there are many
Social media has transformed the way we used to interact with each other
We have grown a tendency that we can share our problems with the person who's sitting hundreds of miles away from us
But not with the person who's sitting right in front of us and
Due to this addiction to these social networking websites such as Facebook and staff very famous one. What's up?
We are losing interaction with our loved ones in our real lives
Now let me ask you a very simple question
Have we ever talked to a person selling newspaper on the street?
Or have we ever talked to a person working in Starbucks or McDonald's?
The answer is no
In today's modern world mobile phones have become more than just a device for us. It has become our lives
We just desperately cling to it by waiting for someone while standing in a queue or while
We are at our home with our loved ones
We just hang on to these electronic devices waiting for someone to be online without realizing
That our loved ones are waiting for us outside the social networking world
We have hundreds of friends on our friend list
But only few of them are there whom we have never seen or met a few of them are there who we have never
Chatted with and the moment we pause to check the notification in the mid conversation
We are sending a direct message that the person who is sitting on the other hand of the phone is more important than the person
Who's sitting right in front of us
The interference of social media in our lives has has killed the trust from our lives
We can't trust the person who we can't see but we cannot trust the person who we can approach and that's why we say
Social media makes us
unsuspect
