00:00.640 --> 00:05.520
The device you are using to watch this video made over 100 border crossings before it reached

00:05.520 --> 00:10.720
your hands. Raw materials were extracted in Central Asia so that individual components

00:10.720 --> 00:15.520
could be manufactured in Taiwan, which used machinery from Central Europe to meet design

00:15.520 --> 00:22.000
specifications that were drafted in South Korea, China, or the US to reach final assembly in East

00:22.000 --> 00:28.080
Asia and made compatible to run on operating systems designed in the US. Components used in

00:28.080 --> 00:34.240
a single iPhone rely on over 200 individual suppliers. To say that your device had to make over

00:34.240 --> 00:40.560
100 border crossings before being unboxed is probably an understatement. This complex web of

00:40.560 --> 00:45.440
commerce is achieved through the process of globalization. Safe shipping lanes and a global

00:45.440 --> 00:50.720
commitment to international trade make this all possible. Globalization has increased the quality

00:50.720 --> 00:56.800
of life for more people than any other economic system in human history. People around the world

00:56.880 --> 01:03.680
have access to more goods at lower prices than ever before. Best of all, globalization lifted over

01:03.680 --> 01:09.680
a billion people out of poverty. No other economic policy has done more for the extreme poor than

01:09.680 --> 01:17.600
globalization. And it's all coming to an end soon. This video is largely sourced from the book

01:17.920 --> 01:22.160
End Is Just The Beginning by Peter Zion. It is linked in the description.

01:25.440 --> 01:30.400
Global trade is nothing new. Anyone who even knows just a little bit about history

01:30.400 --> 01:36.480
has heard of the Silk Road or the Triangular Trade. However, these early globalization trade

01:36.480 --> 01:43.360
networks lacked safe and secure passages. Piracy and kleptocracy made foreign trade incredibly

01:43.360 --> 01:50.560
expensive and risky. Global trade was isolated within specific European empires. The English,

01:50.560 --> 01:57.760
French, Spanish, and others all had their own trade networks and rarely traded with one another.

01:57.760 --> 02:03.280
Of course, they would steal from each other during times of war, which happened often.

02:03.280 --> 02:09.040
The lack of cooperation between European powers made it easier for pirates to roam the Caribbean

02:09.120 --> 02:15.280
and Mediterranean seas. If ships could evade pirates, their cargo may still be plundered by

02:15.280 --> 02:21.440
rival nations. It was quite common for competing European powers to steal each other's cargo.

02:21.440 --> 02:26.000
The English would steal from the French, the French would steal from the Spanish,

02:26.000 --> 02:30.960
and pirates would steal from everybody. Clashing colonial powers would make foreign trade

02:30.960 --> 02:38.080
unreliable, and in turn more expensive. This would be the norm of global trade until 1945.

02:38.960 --> 02:44.480
By the end of the Second World War, there would only be two global powers, each with their own

02:44.480 --> 02:50.720
sphere of influence. But unlike the USSR, the United States would emerge as the world's sole

02:50.720 --> 02:56.240
naval power. While the Soviets would hold Eastern Europe and Central Asia, America would have the

02:56.240 --> 03:03.360
oceans. All of them. When Western Europe had their turn with controlling the global oceans,

03:03.360 --> 03:08.640
that power was used exclusively to enrich the mother country. A mix of colonization and

03:08.640 --> 03:13.760
state-sponsored monopolies were all designed to generate wealth for the homeland. When Americans

03:13.760 --> 03:19.440
took control of the seas, they had a different idea. Scarred by the horrors of the World Wars,

03:19.440 --> 03:25.600
the United States decided to use their naval superiority to grant free trade across all nations,

03:25.680 --> 03:32.320
including their very recent enemies. Everyone could participate in this new, free global trade

03:32.320 --> 03:38.400
network. The high cost of providing a global navy to keep shipping lanes safe would be paid entirely

03:38.400 --> 03:43.760
by the Americans. There was only one catch to participate in this free global trade network.

03:43.760 --> 03:50.320
You would have to be firmly anti-Soviet. Despite this geopolitical mandate, a new era of global

03:50.320 --> 03:56.400
trade was unleashed. The days of cargo ships being stolen by rival nations or pirates was over.

03:56.400 --> 04:02.560
If your country lacked natural resources or food, it could now be easily imported, without needing to

04:02.560 --> 04:08.640
bow to a European colonial master. And this was just the beginning. The free trade network would

04:08.640 --> 04:15.520
eventually be opened up to communist China in 1979. The golden age of globalism had arrived.

04:15.600 --> 04:20.800
In this new era, Brits could play Nintendo, Americans could drive Volkswagen,

04:20.800 --> 04:27.200
and Indians could drink Coca-Cola. But the golden age of economic growth wasn't solely due to the

04:27.200 --> 04:33.040
American navy providing safe passage around the world. The World Bank and International Monetary

04:33.040 --> 04:38.320
Fund were established to provide loans to nations that missed out on industrialization.

04:38.960 --> 04:43.600
Underdeveloped nations could get low-interest loans to rapidly industrialize.

04:44.400 --> 04:50.240
Of course, these loans came with political strings attached, notably anti-corruption

04:50.240 --> 04:57.360
and anti-Soviet agreements. Nonetheless, these loans, in conjunction with free global trade,

04:57.360 --> 05:02.800
ushered in an age of prosperity for both the developed and underdeveloped world.

05:02.800 --> 05:08.080
Wealthy countries could offshore manufacturing to nations with cheaper labor costs and fewer

05:08.080 --> 05:14.000
regulations. The underdeveloped nations would be flooded with new job opportunities,

05:14.000 --> 05:17.600
and wealthy countries could get more goods at lower prices.

05:18.240 --> 05:22.480
Nearly everyone outside the Soviet sphere saw their quality of life improve.

05:23.280 --> 05:30.880
This era saw the fastest global economic growth in human history, at least until the next era of globalization.

05:31.280 --> 05:41.280
Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall.

05:44.880 --> 05:51.200
By the late 1980s, the Soviet empire began to crumble. Eastern Europe and Central Asia were

05:51.200 --> 05:56.080
now allowed to join the globalized economy. While the transition from a command economy

05:56.160 --> 06:01.440
into a free market economy made for a rough decade in the 90s, they would be winners in the long

06:01.440 --> 06:07.360
run. With a reunited Germany and a strong belief that international trade results in international

06:07.360 --> 06:13.760
peace, EU investments flowed towards the east. The former Warsaw Pact countries saw an explosion

06:13.760 --> 06:19.440
of growth and even had higher growth rates than their western neighbors. Manufactured exports was

06:19.440 --> 06:25.680
the name of the game for these countries, and their wealth would rise. But the end of the Cold

06:25.680 --> 06:30.880
War wasn't the only thing that enhanced global trade. There is this cool new technology called the

06:30.880 --> 06:40.240
Internet. Internet is that massive computer network, the one that's becoming really big now.

06:40.640 --> 06:57.920
The Internet made transcontinental communication cheaper than ever before. The cost of transforming

06:57.920 --> 07:04.720
a national corporation into an international one was radically cheaper. But big corporations were

07:04.720 --> 07:10.880
not the only beneficiaries of the Internet. Now, small artisans could access the global market to

07:10.880 --> 07:17.600
find new customers, new suppliers, and new investors. Iteric guitarists could attract audiences in the

07:17.600 --> 07:23.040
Netherlands. Dominican painters could find customers in Australia, and Mexican artists

07:23.040 --> 07:31.360
could make custom pieces for clients in China. The world was smaller, faster, cheaper, and everyone

07:31.360 --> 07:41.680
was getting richer. Well, almost everyone. If the effects of globalization could be summarized in one

07:41.680 --> 07:47.120
page, this is the graph to look at. Officially known as the Lachner-Millenevocht graph,

07:47.760 --> 07:53.760
it is better known as the elephant graph. Due to its unique shape, this graph shows the international

07:53.760 --> 07:58.000
wealth growth experience between the fall of the Berlin Wall to the Great Recession.

07:58.560 --> 08:04.160
The left end shows the poorest of the poor, and the right end the richest of the rich.

08:08.640 --> 08:12.800
The furthest left end represents people in countries who weren't able to fully

08:12.800 --> 08:19.600
capitalize on globalization. They live in areas that are too remote or too unstable to have tapped

08:19.600 --> 08:25.680
into the wealth creation caused by globalization. Moving to the right, we see tremendous growth.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.000
These are the developing nations that became the real winners of globalization.

08:30.640 --> 08:37.680
India, China, Mexico, and Brazil are all well known for their growth during this period,

08:37.680 --> 08:43.120
but this growth wasn't limited to large countries. Smaller countries like the Dominican Republic,

08:43.120 --> 08:50.400
Lithuania, Panama, and Gola, in dozens more, also experienced impressive GDP per capita growth.

08:50.480 --> 08:54.720
Wealth generation from globalization was available to all, big and small.

08:56.960 --> 09:01.920
This exceptional growth rate brought about 1.1 billion people out of extreme poverty.

09:03.200 --> 09:08.160
Because of globalization, starvation and famines have become exceptionally rare.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.400
People no longer have to depend on local weather for good harvest.

09:13.120 --> 09:18.880
Fertilizers, high-tech agricultural equipment, and the latest advances in irrigation technology

09:19.360 --> 09:26.400
can now be easily imported. The amount of tonnage yields per acre skyrocketed for almost every crop

09:26.400 --> 09:31.360
in every continent. Does your country have poor soils for agricultural production?

09:32.160 --> 09:39.840
No problem. Imported food is cheap and plentiful. There is no need to toil on poor land when your

09:39.840 --> 09:45.920
country could specialize in something else. Because of global agricultural trade, every country in the

09:45.920 --> 09:52.160
world, with five tragic exceptions, saw a decrease in deaths caused by malnutrition.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.480
This all sounds like a pretty good deal. Until we start to move further right along the elephant

10:02.480 --> 10:08.240
graph, the wealth growth takes a considerable nosedive. These are the low-skilled and semi-skilled

10:08.240 --> 10:13.920
workers in rich countries. The working class of the Anglosphere and Western Europe would not

10:13.920 --> 10:19.760
enjoy the same wealth growth as the rest of the world. And in some cases, quite the opposite.

10:19.760 --> 10:24.640
These people saw their careers shipped overseas. To people who would do the same job for cheaper,

10:25.280 --> 10:30.560
entire communities in the United States were left devastated by the results of globalization,

10:30.560 --> 10:36.240
creating a massive region known as the Rust Belt. The factories that were once so critical in

10:36.240 --> 10:42.240
winning the Second World War became shuttered in favor of cheaper labor in faraway places,

10:42.880 --> 10:48.800
once thriving middle-class communities became ghettoized. This isn't unique to the United

10:48.800 --> 10:54.080
States. Communities throughout the Anglosphere and Western Europe have their own version of the

10:54.080 --> 11:02.480
Rust Belt. Places like Southern Ontario, Willigong, Wales, Flanders, the Ruger Beat,

11:03.120 --> 11:09.360
Nordpaal de Calais, and the Basque Country have all felt economic hardship from globalization.

11:10.160 --> 11:15.280
Economic insecurity made the working class of rich countries hostile towards globalization.

11:15.280 --> 11:19.920
Their animosity is further compounded as we continue to move right along the elephant graph.

11:20.720 --> 11:26.880
On the furthest right end, we see the richest people in the richest countries getting richer.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.520
This is the class of people who have been able to truly tap into the wealth creation

11:31.520 --> 11:36.080
created by globalization. This part of the graph can be divided into two sections,

11:36.880 --> 11:43.120
highly skilled workers and the investor class. The growth of globalization meant that brands

11:43.120 --> 11:47.920
now have to compete with companies on the other side of the planet. To remain competitive in

11:47.920 --> 11:53.680
the global marketplace, they need highly skilled workers. The demand for engineers,

11:53.680 --> 11:58.880
researchers, marketers, designers, and other highly skilled workers greatly increased.

11:58.880 --> 12:04.320
As demand for these highly skilled workers increased, so did their salaries. On the very

12:04.400 --> 12:09.840
far right end of the graph is the investor class. When the world is undergoing unprecedented economic

12:09.840 --> 12:15.280
growth, it's pretty easy to turn a large pile of money into an even bigger pile of money. This

12:15.280 --> 12:20.480
led to resentment from the working class people in rich countries. To the people on the lower

12:20.480 --> 12:25.920
trunk of the elephant, it seems like everyone in the world is getting richer, except for themselves.

12:26.480 --> 12:31.440
While they lived in fear of unemployment, their fellow countrymen were enjoying exceptional

12:31.440 --> 12:37.360
wealth growth. For most of the G7 nations, a strong welfare system has been put in place.

12:38.000 --> 12:43.760
Even if someone loses their job due to globalization, they can still plan on receiving healthcare,

12:43.760 --> 12:49.520
their kids can still go to university at reasonable costs, and they themselves can receive new training

12:49.520 --> 12:55.840
to pursue a higher paying career. This is all paid by taxing the gains of the winners of globalization

12:55.840 --> 13:01.920
to fund programs for the losers of globalization. Every G7 country does this to a certain extent,

13:02.480 --> 13:07.840
except for one, which just so happens to be the one that pays for the global navy that makes this

13:07.840 --> 13:15.280
all possible in the first place. Most U.S. citizens do not have a favorable opinion of

13:15.280 --> 13:21.840
globalization. When asked if globalization is a good thing for their country, only 42% of Americans

13:21.840 --> 13:26.720
answered in the affirmative. And that's not too far off from the global country average,

13:26.720 --> 13:32.080
where only 48% of respondents think globalization is good for their country. While it would be

13:32.080 --> 13:37.680
easy to say, who cares what the stupid Americans think? It should not be forgotten that the American

13:37.680 --> 13:44.000
navy makes globalization possible in the first place. Without it, the bad old days of piracy

13:44.000 --> 13:49.040
and theft from rival governments will make a comeback. The increased risk of stolen cargo

13:49.040 --> 13:54.400
translates into increased costs for consumers. While international trade can certainly exist

13:54.400 --> 13:59.920
on land within connected regions, shipping by sea has about one-twelfth of the cost compared

13:59.920 --> 14:05.760
to land shipping, assuming they're safe passage on the seas. When the Soviet empire fell, the

14:05.760 --> 14:11.360
purpose of the global American navy fell with it. America's global naval presence had one main

14:11.360 --> 14:18.960
objective, keep the Soviets contained. Global trade security was just a side benefit. With the

14:18.960 --> 14:26.160
Soviets gone, the global US navy lost its purpose. The American public's frustration with globalization

14:26.160 --> 14:31.760
would become apparent during the 2016 presidential election. Near the end of his presidency,

14:32.480 --> 14:37.840
George W. Bush began the lengthy negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.

14:37.840 --> 14:44.080
These negotiations would be continued by Barack Obama, and last his entire presidency. This would

14:44.080 --> 14:50.480
have been a massive trade deal that included 12 Pacific countries. Combined, these 12 countries

14:50.480 --> 14:57.520
represent about 40% of global GDP. However, the deal would face major opposition from two prominent

14:57.520 --> 15:04.880
presidential candidates. Nobody doubts that corporations have shut down in America and gone

15:04.880 --> 15:09.440
to low-wage countries. It makes sense to them. Why do they want to pay an American worker

15:09.440 --> 15:14.400
15 or 20 bucks an hour when you go to Vietnam? You know what the minimum wage in Vietnam is?

15:14.400 --> 15:22.560
It is 56 cents an hour. As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton voted for virtually every trade

15:22.560 --> 15:30.960
agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs. The Trans-Pacific

15:30.960 --> 15:39.120
Partnership is the greatest danger yet. The TPP, as it's known, would be the death blow

15:39.120 --> 15:45.840
for American manufacturing. While Bernie would not make it to the White House, Trump did. The

15:45.840 --> 15:51.280
United States would formulate withdrawal from the TPP on Trump's first day of office. But

15:51.280 --> 15:57.040
scuttling the TPP wasn't Trump's only anti-globalization initiative. He would live up to his campaign

15:57.040 --> 16:03.920
promise on reducing trade with China by introducing new tariffs in 2018. Even with Trump out of the

16:03.920 --> 16:09.360
White House, his tariffs remain. President Biden has stated that he's open to reconfiguring these

16:09.360 --> 16:14.800
tariffs, but no action has been taken at the time of this video. The American public has a growing

16:14.800 --> 16:20.800
skepticism of globalization and it's starting to impact elections. American taxpayers pay over

16:20.880 --> 16:28.080
$150 billion every year to keep the oceans safe for free trade, and voters are questioning if it's

16:28.080 --> 16:33.360
worth it. Globalization has been the best thing to happen to high-skilled workers in poor countries,

16:33.360 --> 16:37.840
but the worst thing to happen to low-skilled workers in rich countries. The frustration has

16:37.840 --> 16:43.200
led to an increased sense of nationalism and isolationism, not only in America, but in many

16:43.200 --> 16:47.360
parts of the highly developed world. And that was before the 2020s.

16:50.560 --> 16:54.560
Scientists in China are trying to determine if a new virus strain is responsible for an

16:54.560 --> 16:59.520
ammonia outbreak in the city of Wuhan. Globalization may have been able to survive populism,

16:59.520 --> 17:04.960
but it probably won't be able to survive the 2020s. COVID taught the world a lot of lessons,

17:04.960 --> 17:09.840
including what happens when global supply chains are weakened. The world experienced shortages of

17:09.840 --> 17:16.480
just about everything, toilet paper, lumber, new cars, any device with a microchip, all had their

17:16.480 --> 17:22.240
turn in being in short supply, some of which have yet to fully recover. To see how fragile

17:22.240 --> 17:27.520
the global economy actually is, let's take a look at America's greatest gift to the world,

17:27.520 --> 17:32.800
blue jeans. Blue jeans are obviously a low-tech product, and one would assume it has a simple

17:32.800 --> 17:38.480
supply chain. This would be an incorrect assumption. The cotton produced to make blue jeans probably

17:38.480 --> 17:44.720
would have been grown in China, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, or Benin. The raw cotton would

17:44.720 --> 17:51.280
then need to be processed into yarn. Probably in India, China, the United States, Uzbekistan,

17:51.280 --> 17:57.920
or Brazil. The yarn would then need to be dyed, likely in Spain, Turkey, or Tunisia.

17:58.560 --> 18:03.760
Of course, this dyeing process would rely on chemicals manufactured in Germany. The finished

18:03.760 --> 18:09.840
denim would then be transported to China, Mexico, or Bangladesh to make its final assent into blue

18:09.840 --> 18:15.920
jeans. Do you like your blue jeans with rivets? Then we'll need even more supply chain steps.

18:15.920 --> 18:23.040
The ore to make those rivets need to be mined in Brazil, Peru, Namiba, Australia, or Chile. The ore

18:23.040 --> 18:28.960
needs to be shipped to rivet factories in Germany, Turkey, or Mexico. And do you like your jeans with

18:28.960 --> 18:34.400
zippers? That's a whole nother supply chain that we'll skip for now. The average pair of jeans

18:34.400 --> 18:38.960
made 10 border crossings before reaching the hands of the final consumer. And that doesn't

18:38.960 --> 18:45.840
account for rivets, zippers, buttons, or other add-ons. And all this just for a stinking pair of pants.

18:46.400 --> 18:53.440
Electronics get way, way more complicated. But you get the idea. Despite globalization's complexity,

18:54.080 --> 18:56.400
everything worked until it didn't.

18:58.240 --> 19:04.000
By January 2022, pretty much every country decided that we would have to live with COVID,

19:04.000 --> 19:09.040
reliable vaccines were available for everyone, and we decided to start to move back to normal.

19:09.680 --> 19:15.280
As German Health Minister Jens Spahn said, pretty much everyone in Germany will be vaccinated,

19:15.280 --> 19:21.520
recovered, or dead. Despite the Macabre Statement, this sentiment was largely agreed with across the

19:21.520 --> 19:26.640
world. After two years of quarantines, the world was ready to get back to normal,

19:26.640 --> 19:31.840
regardless of vaccination rates. There is one exception to this sentiment, and they just so

19:31.840 --> 19:38.000
happened to be the second biggest player in globalization, China. At the time of this video,

19:38.640 --> 19:44.080
the official stance from Beijing is that they will maintain a zero COVID policy until at least

19:44.640 --> 19:52.640
2027. Zero COVID entails isolating entire buildings, neighborhoods, districts, or even cities to keep

19:52.640 --> 19:57.840
COVID contained. Reliable numbers of how many people are enduring lockdowns are hard to come by,

19:58.480 --> 20:03.920
but its economic impact has been felt very hard via inflation. While the rest of the world is

20:03.920 --> 20:09.680
ready to get back to working and consuming, China is not, and everything is more expensive because

20:09.680 --> 20:15.760
of it. Remember the earlier blue gene example? China appeared more times than any other nation

20:15.760 --> 20:21.520
in the supply chain, and China is involved in way more than just blue genes. They're involved in

20:21.520 --> 20:27.840
everything. The more value added a good has, the more dependency it has on China. With China's

20:27.840 --> 20:34.640
zero COVID policy, inventories are low, and prices are high. Companies who are heavily reliant on

20:34.640 --> 20:40.000
Chinese manufacturing are scrambling to find alternatives. China and the US have been growing

20:40.000 --> 20:45.520
distant for the past six years or so, but that's being kicked into overdrive due to the zero COVID

20:45.520 --> 20:50.640
policy. If your biggest trading partner isn't making anything to trade, there aren't many

20:50.640 --> 20:55.520
options to consider other than trying to find a new manufacturing partner. This dilemma isn't

20:55.520 --> 21:01.440
unique to the United States. Nearly every European and Latino publication that I've come across in

21:01.440 --> 21:08.080
researching this is also expressing frustration with China's zero COVID stance. This is forcing

21:08.080 --> 21:14.240
multinational companies to find new manufacturing partners outside of China. Rebuilding factories

21:14.240 --> 21:20.000
in new locations will be costly and timely, but not as hard as finding a way to replace China's

21:20.000 --> 21:25.040
gigantic workforce. But the good news for China is that they won't be remembered as the biggest

21:25.040 --> 21:31.920
villains of the decade. That dishonor belongs to Russia. Now, it feels in bad taste to talk about

21:31.920 --> 21:36.080
how the Ukraine war will have an impact on the global market. There are a lot of bad things

21:36.080 --> 21:40.960
happening to innocent people, and it feels horrible to discuss how this will impact the price of blue

21:40.960 --> 21:48.640
jeans. But this is a video about global economics, and the show must go on. The Russian invasion of

21:48.640 --> 21:53.520
Ukraine will have a devastating impact on globalization, while China makes consumer goods

21:53.520 --> 21:58.240
that the world can survive without, both Russia and Ukraine export something much more vital.

21:59.040 --> 22:04.400
Food. Combined, the two countries export about 36% of the world's wheat supply,

22:05.040 --> 22:11.840
and over half of the world's vegetable oils. With all food exports combined, Ukraine and Russia

22:11.840 --> 22:18.880
produce nearly 12% of the world's total calories. To make matters worse, Russia is the world's

22:18.880 --> 22:24.080
biggest fertilizer exporter, accounting for about 15% of the global fertilizer market.

22:24.640 --> 22:28.640
At the time of this video, Ukraine has been able to still export their grain,

22:29.280 --> 22:34.160
largely due to mediation brokered by Turkey. But most of the current grain exports are coming

22:34.160 --> 22:39.920
from a crop supply that was planted before the invasion. Unsurprisingly, Ukrainian farmers

22:39.920 --> 22:45.600
are having a hard time sowing next season's crop with an ongoing invasion. Even in parts of Ukraine

22:45.600 --> 22:51.360
that are far from the front line, many farmhands have left their jobs to support the defense effort.

22:51.920 --> 22:58.080
One way or another, the longer this war goes on, the more expensive food will become. But food

22:58.080 --> 23:02.480
prices aren't the only thing we have to worry about from this invasion. Do you live in Europe

23:02.480 --> 23:07.920
and like cheap utilities? I'm afraid I have some bad news. Chances are, if you're watching this

23:07.920 --> 23:13.040
video, you are already aware of the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. While Europe isn't

23:13.040 --> 23:18.160
actually engaged in real combat with Russia, they are certainly engaged in economic combat.

23:18.800 --> 23:25.360
As such, Putin shut off all westward-flowing gas, and pipelines have been mysteriously sabotaged.

23:25.360 --> 23:31.120
Depending on the specific nation, Europe just lost about 10-30% of their total energy supply.

23:31.680 --> 23:36.000
This is going to cause more problems than just needing to wear extra clothes to stay warm.

23:36.000 --> 23:43.360
In the blue jean example, Germany plays a very critical role. The production of complex machinery

23:43.360 --> 23:49.600
and chemicals, the machines needed to process cotton into yarn, yarn into denim, and denim into

23:49.600 --> 23:56.080
pants, can probably be traced to Germany one way or another. Germany's involvement in globalization

23:56.080 --> 24:00.640
extends well beyond blue jeans. Germany has positioned itself to be the third largest

24:00.640 --> 24:07.840
exporter in the world, only behind the US and China. While the United States provides services,

24:07.840 --> 24:12.960
in China provides labor, Germany provides something else that is just as crucial to make

24:12.960 --> 24:19.120
globalization work. Sophisticated machinery and chemicals, Germany has positioned itself to be

24:19.120 --> 24:25.120
the leading supplier of complex machinery. Without German machinery, modern manufacturing simply

24:25.120 --> 24:30.880
wanted exist. Germany's integration into globalization allowed it to emerge as the

24:30.880 --> 24:37.040
largest economy in Europe, but there is one problem with the German economy. It needs affordable

24:37.040 --> 24:42.240
energy to operate. Energy which is becoming increasingly expensive, which will make the

24:42.240 --> 24:47.200
machines more expensive, which will make the manufacturing of goods more expensive,

24:47.200 --> 24:53.280
which will make goods more expensive for everyone. The interconnectivity of globalization

24:53.280 --> 24:59.600
means that when one major power faces an economic crisis, the whole world faces an economic crisis.

25:00.240 --> 25:05.200
The recent stresses on global supply lines may be enough to lead to the end of globalization,

25:06.240 --> 25:11.920
but I have good news, sort of. Despite the gloomy headlines and events of this decade,

25:12.480 --> 25:15.920
globalization was destined to fail, all on its own.

25:16.880 --> 25:24.800
Globalization has done many amazing things. It has greatly reduced extreme poverty,

25:24.800 --> 25:30.480
provided more high-tech goods at cheap prices, and created the most rapid economic growth period

25:30.480 --> 25:37.040
in human history. But one of the byproducts of globalization is urbanization. Farmers could now

25:37.040 --> 25:43.040
use high-tech equipment for sowing, harvesting, and processing. The need for farm hands greatly

25:43.040 --> 25:49.200
decreased. Nearly everywhere on earth, people left rural communities and moved to the cities

25:49.200 --> 25:55.200
for better job prospects. The dream of owning your own farm was replaced by the dream of becoming a

25:55.200 --> 26:02.160
yuppie. While this sounds inconsequential, it had a profound effect on birth rates. On the farm,

26:02.960 --> 26:08.720
kids are assets that provide free labor. In the city, kids are very expensive pets.

26:09.520 --> 26:13.920
As a result, birth rates plummeted across the industrialized world.

26:16.000 --> 26:22.560
We've talked about how globalization depends on access to safe seas, energy, raw materials,

26:22.560 --> 26:28.320
technology, and food, but I've saved the most important ingredient for globalization for last.

26:29.120 --> 26:35.680
People. For globalization to work, it needs a reliable supply of workers, consumers,

26:35.760 --> 26:40.720
and investors. And due to decreased birth rates, we're running out of all of those.

26:41.600 --> 26:47.760
When people are aged 18 to 65, they tend to be workers, consumers, taxpayers,

26:47.760 --> 26:53.360
and investors all at the same time. But that changes when they retire. Obviously,

26:53.360 --> 26:59.760
retired people don't work, but they also tend to reduce their consumption and stop investing.

26:59.760 --> 27:05.440
Much of their retirement funds are pulled out of the stock market and converted into bonds or cash,

27:05.440 --> 27:10.880
in most countries, they also receive some form of government pension. After decades of

27:10.880 --> 27:16.400
low fertility rates, there's going to be a smaller tax population to support these pensions.

27:17.040 --> 27:22.720
Assuming no changes are made to benefits, taxes must go up, which will reduce cash available

27:22.720 --> 27:28.240
for consumption and investment. Smaller investment pools means less technological innovation,

27:28.880 --> 27:34.240
and less consumption makes investing less profitable. Demographics and population

27:34.240 --> 27:38.880
pyramids will have a wide variance from country to country, but most nations that are fully

27:38.880 --> 27:45.200
industrialized are destined to reach a point where there are more retirees than there are workers.

27:45.840 --> 27:50.800
Most pensions, private or public, will struggle to achieve promised payouts.

27:51.680 --> 27:56.560
But that's not the only concern with population collapse. The Dutch government has made a helpful

27:56.560 --> 28:01.520
list of what their country will look like when population decline really takes off.

28:01.600 --> 28:06.320
Are you planning a career in education or residential development? That's probably a bad

28:06.320 --> 28:11.600
idea. Planning a career in retail? That's going to be harder to do with fewer customers who are

28:11.600 --> 28:18.320
going to be paying higher taxes to accommodate retirees. Theaters, cinemas, and concert halls

28:18.320 --> 28:23.680
are all going to have a difficult time selling tickets when there's fewer people with smaller

28:23.680 --> 28:29.440
disposable incomes. I love Dutch city design as much as anybody else, but that's going to be harder

28:29.440 --> 28:35.440
to maintain with the smaller tax pool. With widespread population decline, quality of life

28:35.440 --> 28:42.240
standards may have already peaked in 2019. In conjunction with inflation, we can expect a future

28:42.240 --> 28:48.880
with higher taxes or reduced public benefits, possibly both. That's not all we can expect

28:48.880 --> 28:55.040
to lose with population decline. Stanford economist Charles Jones recently authored a paper titled

28:55.520 --> 29:00.800
The End of Economic Growth, Unintended Consequences of a Declining Population.

29:01.440 --> 29:06.960
In the paper, Jones proposed what new economic models will look like with a declining population.

29:07.600 --> 29:13.680
To greatly oversimplify, Jones predicts that with less people, there will be fewer technological

29:13.680 --> 29:20.000
advancements. So much so that quality of living standards will plateau. When most people reach

29:20.000 --> 29:25.120
for hope, when contemplating economic decline from depopulation, they look to Japan.

29:26.480 --> 29:31.680
Japan has been dealing with the challenges of population decline for about five decades.

29:34.560 --> 29:40.320
And their GDP per capita peaked in 2012. All things considered, that's not too bad,

29:40.320 --> 29:46.560
but their methodology won't be replicable in other countries. To remain economically viable,

29:46.560 --> 29:51.360
during their demographic crisis, Japan relied on a new economic strategy called

29:51.920 --> 29:58.160
de-sourcing. Instead of manufacturing in Japan, multinational companies would rely on local

29:58.160 --> 30:03.920
labor forces, where their products are sold. If a Toyota was sold in America, it was probably

30:03.920 --> 30:10.720
built in America. If a Toshiba was sold in Brazil, it was probably built in Brazil. This works fine

30:11.520 --> 30:17.280
until the client countries start experiencing their own population decline induced recession.

30:17.280 --> 30:21.040
As workforces and customer pools start to shrink around the world,

30:21.040 --> 30:27.520
de-sourcing will become a less viable solution, if possible at all. Additionally, Japan was already

30:27.520 --> 30:33.280
wealthy when they started to experience population decline. They had the needed capital to pay for

30:33.280 --> 30:38.160
all the new manufacturing hubs as part of their de-sourcing strategy. Other countries who got

30:38.160 --> 30:44.240
old before they got rich won't be able to do the same. If you're lucky enough to live in a rich

30:44.240 --> 30:50.400
country, your quality of life is probably already peaked and will plateau over the next few decades.

30:51.200 --> 30:56.320
If you live in a poor country, there's a strong chance that your quality of life will decline,

30:56.320 --> 31:00.400
but forward thinking rich countries will beg you to immigrate there.

31:02.160 --> 31:07.520
Humanity's next chapter looks pretty grim, probably not Bronze Age collapse grim,

31:07.520 --> 31:14.640
but the Golden Age of Globalization is coming to an end. Maybe at the end of Jones' paper,

31:14.640 --> 31:19.360
he concluded that the economy has a way of sorting itself out during major stresses.

31:20.080 --> 31:26.960
Who knows, maybe decreased housing costs can free up cash to invest in automation that will

31:26.960 --> 31:32.000
save us from a worker shortage. Maybe healthier lifestyles will allow people to work beyond the

31:32.000 --> 31:38.880
age of 65. But what do you think? Has our quality of life peaked? Or can we expect continued wealth

31:38.880 --> 31:44.800
growth and technological advancement in the coming decades? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.
