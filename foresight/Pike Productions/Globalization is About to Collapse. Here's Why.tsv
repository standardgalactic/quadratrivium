640	5520	The device you are using to watch this video made over 100 border crossings before it reached
5520	10720	your hands. Raw materials were extracted in Central Asia so that individual components
10720	15520	could be manufactured in Taiwan, which used machinery from Central Europe to meet design
15520	22000	specifications that were drafted in South Korea, China, or the US to reach final assembly in East
22000	28080	Asia and made compatible to run on operating systems designed in the US. Components used in
28080	34240	a single iPhone rely on over 200 individual suppliers. To say that your device had to make over
34240	40560	100 border crossings before being unboxed is probably an understatement. This complex web of
40560	45440	commerce is achieved through the process of globalization. Safe shipping lanes and a global
45440	50720	commitment to international trade make this all possible. Globalization has increased the quality
50720	56800	of life for more people than any other economic system in human history. People around the world
56880	63680	have access to more goods at lower prices than ever before. Best of all, globalization lifted over
63680	69680	a billion people out of poverty. No other economic policy has done more for the extreme poor than
69680	77600	globalization. And it's all coming to an end soon. This video is largely sourced from the book
77920	82160	End Is Just The Beginning by Peter Zion. It is linked in the description.
85440	90400	Global trade is nothing new. Anyone who even knows just a little bit about history
90400	96480	has heard of the Silk Road or the Triangular Trade. However, these early globalization trade
96480	103360	networks lacked safe and secure passages. Piracy and kleptocracy made foreign trade incredibly
103360	110560	expensive and risky. Global trade was isolated within specific European empires. The English,
110560	117760	French, Spanish, and others all had their own trade networks and rarely traded with one another.
117760	123280	Of course, they would steal from each other during times of war, which happened often.
123280	129040	The lack of cooperation between European powers made it easier for pirates to roam the Caribbean
129120	135280	and Mediterranean seas. If ships could evade pirates, their cargo may still be plundered by
135280	141440	rival nations. It was quite common for competing European powers to steal each other's cargo.
141440	146000	The English would steal from the French, the French would steal from the Spanish,
146000	150960	and pirates would steal from everybody. Clashing colonial powers would make foreign trade
150960	158080	unreliable, and in turn more expensive. This would be the norm of global trade until 1945.
158960	164480	By the end of the Second World War, there would only be two global powers, each with their own
164480	170720	sphere of influence. But unlike the USSR, the United States would emerge as the world's sole
170720	176240	naval power. While the Soviets would hold Eastern Europe and Central Asia, America would have the
176240	183360	oceans. All of them. When Western Europe had their turn with controlling the global oceans,
183360	188640	that power was used exclusively to enrich the mother country. A mix of colonization and
188640	193760	state-sponsored monopolies were all designed to generate wealth for the homeland. When Americans
193760	199440	took control of the seas, they had a different idea. Scarred by the horrors of the World Wars,
199440	205600	the United States decided to use their naval superiority to grant free trade across all nations,
205680	212320	including their very recent enemies. Everyone could participate in this new, free global trade
212320	218400	network. The high cost of providing a global navy to keep shipping lanes safe would be paid entirely
218400	223760	by the Americans. There was only one catch to participate in this free global trade network.
223760	230320	You would have to be firmly anti-Soviet. Despite this geopolitical mandate, a new era of global
230320	236400	trade was unleashed. The days of cargo ships being stolen by rival nations or pirates was over.
236400	242560	If your country lacked natural resources or food, it could now be easily imported, without needing to
242560	248640	bow to a European colonial master. And this was just the beginning. The free trade network would
248640	255520	eventually be opened up to communist China in 1979. The golden age of globalism had arrived.
255600	260800	In this new era, Brits could play Nintendo, Americans could drive Volkswagen,
260800	267200	and Indians could drink Coca-Cola. But the golden age of economic growth wasn't solely due to the
267200	273040	American navy providing safe passage around the world. The World Bank and International Monetary
273040	278320	Fund were established to provide loans to nations that missed out on industrialization.
278960	283600	Underdeveloped nations could get low-interest loans to rapidly industrialize.
284400	290240	Of course, these loans came with political strings attached, notably anti-corruption
290240	297360	and anti-Soviet agreements. Nonetheless, these loans, in conjunction with free global trade,
297360	302800	ushered in an age of prosperity for both the developed and underdeveloped world.
302800	308080	Wealthy countries could offshore manufacturing to nations with cheaper labor costs and fewer
308080	314000	regulations. The underdeveloped nations would be flooded with new job opportunities,
314000	317600	and wealthy countries could get more goods at lower prices.
318240	322480	Nearly everyone outside the Soviet sphere saw their quality of life improve.
323280	330880	This era saw the fastest global economic growth in human history, at least until the next era of globalization.
331280	341280	Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall.
344880	351200	By the late 1980s, the Soviet empire began to crumble. Eastern Europe and Central Asia were
351200	356080	now allowed to join the globalized economy. While the transition from a command economy
356160	361440	into a free market economy made for a rough decade in the 90s, they would be winners in the long
361440	367360	run. With a reunited Germany and a strong belief that international trade results in international
367360	373760	peace, EU investments flowed towards the east. The former Warsaw Pact countries saw an explosion
373760	379440	of growth and even had higher growth rates than their western neighbors. Manufactured exports was
379440	385680	the name of the game for these countries, and their wealth would rise. But the end of the Cold
385680	390880	War wasn't the only thing that enhanced global trade. There is this cool new technology called the
390880	400240	Internet. Internet is that massive computer network, the one that's becoming really big now.
400640	417920	The Internet made transcontinental communication cheaper than ever before. The cost of transforming
417920	424720	a national corporation into an international one was radically cheaper. But big corporations were
424720	430880	not the only beneficiaries of the Internet. Now, small artisans could access the global market to
430880	437600	find new customers, new suppliers, and new investors. Iteric guitarists could attract audiences in the
437600	443040	Netherlands. Dominican painters could find customers in Australia, and Mexican artists
443040	451360	could make custom pieces for clients in China. The world was smaller, faster, cheaper, and everyone
451360	461680	was getting richer. Well, almost everyone. If the effects of globalization could be summarized in one
461680	467120	page, this is the graph to look at. Officially known as the Lachner-Millenevocht graph,
467760	473760	it is better known as the elephant graph. Due to its unique shape, this graph shows the international
473760	478000	wealth growth experience between the fall of the Berlin Wall to the Great Recession.
478560	484160	The left end shows the poorest of the poor, and the right end the richest of the rich.
488640	492800	The furthest left end represents people in countries who weren't able to fully
492800	499600	capitalize on globalization. They live in areas that are too remote or too unstable to have tapped
499600	505680	into the wealth creation caused by globalization. Moving to the right, we see tremendous growth.
506320	510000	These are the developing nations that became the real winners of globalization.
510640	517680	India, China, Mexico, and Brazil are all well known for their growth during this period,
517680	523120	but this growth wasn't limited to large countries. Smaller countries like the Dominican Republic,
523120	530400	Lithuania, Panama, and Gola, in dozens more, also experienced impressive GDP per capita growth.
530480	534720	Wealth generation from globalization was available to all, big and small.
536960	541920	This exceptional growth rate brought about 1.1 billion people out of extreme poverty.
543200	548160	Because of globalization, starvation and famines have become exceptionally rare.
549120	552400	People no longer have to depend on local weather for good harvest.
553120	558880	Fertilizers, high-tech agricultural equipment, and the latest advances in irrigation technology
559360	566400	can now be easily imported. The amount of tonnage yields per acre skyrocketed for almost every crop
566400	571360	in every continent. Does your country have poor soils for agricultural production?
572160	579840	No problem. Imported food is cheap and plentiful. There is no need to toil on poor land when your
579840	585920	country could specialize in something else. Because of global agricultural trade, every country in the
585920	592160	world, with five tragic exceptions, saw a decrease in deaths caused by malnutrition.
597920	602480	This all sounds like a pretty good deal. Until we start to move further right along the elephant
602480	608240	graph, the wealth growth takes a considerable nosedive. These are the low-skilled and semi-skilled
608240	613920	workers in rich countries. The working class of the Anglosphere and Western Europe would not
613920	619760	enjoy the same wealth growth as the rest of the world. And in some cases, quite the opposite.
619760	624640	These people saw their careers shipped overseas. To people who would do the same job for cheaper,
625280	630560	entire communities in the United States were left devastated by the results of globalization,
630560	636240	creating a massive region known as the Rust Belt. The factories that were once so critical in
636240	642240	winning the Second World War became shuttered in favor of cheaper labor in faraway places,
642880	648800	once thriving middle-class communities became ghettoized. This isn't unique to the United
648800	654080	States. Communities throughout the Anglosphere and Western Europe have their own version of the
654080	662480	Rust Belt. Places like Southern Ontario, Willigong, Wales, Flanders, the Ruger Beat,
663120	669360	Nordpaal de Calais, and the Basque Country have all felt economic hardship from globalization.
670160	675280	Economic insecurity made the working class of rich countries hostile towards globalization.
675280	679920	Their animosity is further compounded as we continue to move right along the elephant graph.
680720	686880	On the furthest right end, we see the richest people in the richest countries getting richer.
687840	691520	This is the class of people who have been able to truly tap into the wealth creation
691520	696080	created by globalization. This part of the graph can be divided into two sections,
696880	703120	highly skilled workers and the investor class. The growth of globalization meant that brands
703120	707920	now have to compete with companies on the other side of the planet. To remain competitive in
707920	713680	the global marketplace, they need highly skilled workers. The demand for engineers,
713680	718880	researchers, marketers, designers, and other highly skilled workers greatly increased.
718880	724320	As demand for these highly skilled workers increased, so did their salaries. On the very
724400	729840	far right end of the graph is the investor class. When the world is undergoing unprecedented economic
729840	735280	growth, it's pretty easy to turn a large pile of money into an even bigger pile of money. This
735280	740480	led to resentment from the working class people in rich countries. To the people on the lower
740480	745920	trunk of the elephant, it seems like everyone in the world is getting richer, except for themselves.
746480	751440	While they lived in fear of unemployment, their fellow countrymen were enjoying exceptional
751440	757360	wealth growth. For most of the G7 nations, a strong welfare system has been put in place.
758000	763760	Even if someone loses their job due to globalization, they can still plan on receiving healthcare,
763760	769520	their kids can still go to university at reasonable costs, and they themselves can receive new training
769520	775840	to pursue a higher paying career. This is all paid by taxing the gains of the winners of globalization
775840	781920	to fund programs for the losers of globalization. Every G7 country does this to a certain extent,
782480	787840	except for one, which just so happens to be the one that pays for the global navy that makes this
787840	795280	all possible in the first place. Most U.S. citizens do not have a favorable opinion of
795280	801840	globalization. When asked if globalization is a good thing for their country, only 42% of Americans
801840	806720	answered in the affirmative. And that's not too far off from the global country average,
806720	812080	where only 48% of respondents think globalization is good for their country. While it would be
812080	817680	easy to say, who cares what the stupid Americans think? It should not be forgotten that the American
817680	824000	navy makes globalization possible in the first place. Without it, the bad old days of piracy
824000	829040	and theft from rival governments will make a comeback. The increased risk of stolen cargo
829040	834400	translates into increased costs for consumers. While international trade can certainly exist
834400	839920	on land within connected regions, shipping by sea has about one-twelfth of the cost compared
839920	845760	to land shipping, assuming they're safe passage on the seas. When the Soviet empire fell, the
845760	851360	purpose of the global American navy fell with it. America's global naval presence had one main
851360	858960	objective, keep the Soviets contained. Global trade security was just a side benefit. With the
858960	866160	Soviets gone, the global US navy lost its purpose. The American public's frustration with globalization
866160	871760	would become apparent during the 2016 presidential election. Near the end of his presidency,
872480	877840	George W. Bush began the lengthy negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.
877840	884080	These negotiations would be continued by Barack Obama, and last his entire presidency. This would
884080	890480	have been a massive trade deal that included 12 Pacific countries. Combined, these 12 countries
890480	897520	represent about 40% of global GDP. However, the deal would face major opposition from two prominent
897520	904880	presidential candidates. Nobody doubts that corporations have shut down in America and gone
904880	909440	to low-wage countries. It makes sense to them. Why do they want to pay an American worker
909440	914400	15 or 20 bucks an hour when you go to Vietnam? You know what the minimum wage in Vietnam is?
914400	922560	It is 56 cents an hour. As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton voted for virtually every trade
922560	930960	agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs. The Trans-Pacific
930960	939120	Partnership is the greatest danger yet. The TPP, as it's known, would be the death blow
939120	945840	for American manufacturing. While Bernie would not make it to the White House, Trump did. The
945840	951280	United States would formulate withdrawal from the TPP on Trump's first day of office. But
951280	957040	scuttling the TPP wasn't Trump's only anti-globalization initiative. He would live up to his campaign
957040	963920	promise on reducing trade with China by introducing new tariffs in 2018. Even with Trump out of the
963920	969360	White House, his tariffs remain. President Biden has stated that he's open to reconfiguring these
969360	974800	tariffs, but no action has been taken at the time of this video. The American public has a growing
974800	980800	skepticism of globalization and it's starting to impact elections. American taxpayers pay over
980880	988080	$150 billion every year to keep the oceans safe for free trade, and voters are questioning if it's
988080	993360	worth it. Globalization has been the best thing to happen to high-skilled workers in poor countries,
993360	997840	but the worst thing to happen to low-skilled workers in rich countries. The frustration has
997840	1003200	led to an increased sense of nationalism and isolationism, not only in America, but in many
1003200	1007360	parts of the highly developed world. And that was before the 2020s.
1010560	1014560	Scientists in China are trying to determine if a new virus strain is responsible for an
1014560	1019520	ammonia outbreak in the city of Wuhan. Globalization may have been able to survive populism,
1019520	1024960	but it probably won't be able to survive the 2020s. COVID taught the world a lot of lessons,
1024960	1029840	including what happens when global supply chains are weakened. The world experienced shortages of
1029840	1036480	just about everything, toilet paper, lumber, new cars, any device with a microchip, all had their
1036480	1042240	turn in being in short supply, some of which have yet to fully recover. To see how fragile
1042240	1047520	the global economy actually is, let's take a look at America's greatest gift to the world,
1047520	1052800	blue jeans. Blue jeans are obviously a low-tech product, and one would assume it has a simple
1052800	1058480	supply chain. This would be an incorrect assumption. The cotton produced to make blue jeans probably
1058480	1064720	would have been grown in China, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, or Benin. The raw cotton would
1064720	1071280	then need to be processed into yarn. Probably in India, China, the United States, Uzbekistan,
1071280	1077920	or Brazil. The yarn would then need to be dyed, likely in Spain, Turkey, or Tunisia.
1078560	1083760	Of course, this dyeing process would rely on chemicals manufactured in Germany. The finished
1083760	1089840	denim would then be transported to China, Mexico, or Bangladesh to make its final assent into blue
1089840	1095920	jeans. Do you like your blue jeans with rivets? Then we'll need even more supply chain steps.
1095920	1103040	The ore to make those rivets need to be mined in Brazil, Peru, Namiba, Australia, or Chile. The ore
1103040	1108960	needs to be shipped to rivet factories in Germany, Turkey, or Mexico. And do you like your jeans with
1108960	1114400	zippers? That's a whole nother supply chain that we'll skip for now. The average pair of jeans
1114400	1118960	made 10 border crossings before reaching the hands of the final consumer. And that doesn't
1118960	1125840	account for rivets, zippers, buttons, or other add-ons. And all this just for a stinking pair of pants.
1126400	1133440	Electronics get way, way more complicated. But you get the idea. Despite globalization's complexity,
1134080	1136400	everything worked until it didn't.
1138240	1144000	By January 2022, pretty much every country decided that we would have to live with COVID,
1144000	1149040	reliable vaccines were available for everyone, and we decided to start to move back to normal.
1149680	1155280	As German Health Minister Jens Spahn said, pretty much everyone in Germany will be vaccinated,
1155280	1161520	recovered, or dead. Despite the Macabre Statement, this sentiment was largely agreed with across the
1161520	1166640	world. After two years of quarantines, the world was ready to get back to normal,
1166640	1171840	regardless of vaccination rates. There is one exception to this sentiment, and they just so
1171840	1178000	happened to be the second biggest player in globalization, China. At the time of this video,
1178640	1184080	the official stance from Beijing is that they will maintain a zero COVID policy until at least
1184640	1192640	2027. Zero COVID entails isolating entire buildings, neighborhoods, districts, or even cities to keep
1192640	1197840	COVID contained. Reliable numbers of how many people are enduring lockdowns are hard to come by,
1198480	1203920	but its economic impact has been felt very hard via inflation. While the rest of the world is
1203920	1209680	ready to get back to working and consuming, China is not, and everything is more expensive because
1209680	1215760	of it. Remember the earlier blue gene example? China appeared more times than any other nation
1215760	1221520	in the supply chain, and China is involved in way more than just blue genes. They're involved in
1221520	1227840	everything. The more value added a good has, the more dependency it has on China. With China's
1227840	1234640	zero COVID policy, inventories are low, and prices are high. Companies who are heavily reliant on
1234640	1240000	Chinese manufacturing are scrambling to find alternatives. China and the US have been growing
1240000	1245520	distant for the past six years or so, but that's being kicked into overdrive due to the zero COVID
1245520	1250640	policy. If your biggest trading partner isn't making anything to trade, there aren't many
1250640	1255520	options to consider other than trying to find a new manufacturing partner. This dilemma isn't
1255520	1261440	unique to the United States. Nearly every European and Latino publication that I've come across in
1261440	1268080	researching this is also expressing frustration with China's zero COVID stance. This is forcing
1268080	1274240	multinational companies to find new manufacturing partners outside of China. Rebuilding factories
1274240	1280000	in new locations will be costly and timely, but not as hard as finding a way to replace China's
1280000	1285040	gigantic workforce. But the good news for China is that they won't be remembered as the biggest
1285040	1291920	villains of the decade. That dishonor belongs to Russia. Now, it feels in bad taste to talk about
1291920	1296080	how the Ukraine war will have an impact on the global market. There are a lot of bad things
1296080	1300960	happening to innocent people, and it feels horrible to discuss how this will impact the price of blue
1300960	1308640	jeans. But this is a video about global economics, and the show must go on. The Russian invasion of
1308640	1313520	Ukraine will have a devastating impact on globalization, while China makes consumer goods
1313520	1318240	that the world can survive without, both Russia and Ukraine export something much more vital.
1319040	1324400	Food. Combined, the two countries export about 36% of the world's wheat supply,
1325040	1331840	and over half of the world's vegetable oils. With all food exports combined, Ukraine and Russia
1331840	1338880	produce nearly 12% of the world's total calories. To make matters worse, Russia is the world's
1338880	1344080	biggest fertilizer exporter, accounting for about 15% of the global fertilizer market.
1344640	1348640	At the time of this video, Ukraine has been able to still export their grain,
1349280	1354160	largely due to mediation brokered by Turkey. But most of the current grain exports are coming
1354160	1359920	from a crop supply that was planted before the invasion. Unsurprisingly, Ukrainian farmers
1359920	1365600	are having a hard time sowing next season's crop with an ongoing invasion. Even in parts of Ukraine
1365600	1371360	that are far from the front line, many farmhands have left their jobs to support the defense effort.
1371920	1378080	One way or another, the longer this war goes on, the more expensive food will become. But food
1378080	1382480	prices aren't the only thing we have to worry about from this invasion. Do you live in Europe
1382480	1387920	and like cheap utilities? I'm afraid I have some bad news. Chances are, if you're watching this
1387920	1393040	video, you are already aware of the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. While Europe isn't
1393040	1398160	actually engaged in real combat with Russia, they are certainly engaged in economic combat.
1398800	1405360	As such, Putin shut off all westward-flowing gas, and pipelines have been mysteriously sabotaged.
1405360	1411120	Depending on the specific nation, Europe just lost about 10-30% of their total energy supply.
1411680	1416000	This is going to cause more problems than just needing to wear extra clothes to stay warm.
1416000	1423360	In the blue jean example, Germany plays a very critical role. The production of complex machinery
1423360	1429600	and chemicals, the machines needed to process cotton into yarn, yarn into denim, and denim into
1429600	1436080	pants, can probably be traced to Germany one way or another. Germany's involvement in globalization
1436080	1440640	extends well beyond blue jeans. Germany has positioned itself to be the third largest
1440640	1447840	exporter in the world, only behind the US and China. While the United States provides services,
1447840	1452960	in China provides labor, Germany provides something else that is just as crucial to make
1452960	1459120	globalization work. Sophisticated machinery and chemicals, Germany has positioned itself to be
1459120	1465120	the leading supplier of complex machinery. Without German machinery, modern manufacturing simply
1465120	1470880	wanted exist. Germany's integration into globalization allowed it to emerge as the
1470880	1477040	largest economy in Europe, but there is one problem with the German economy. It needs affordable
1477040	1482240	energy to operate. Energy which is becoming increasingly expensive, which will make the
1482240	1487200	machines more expensive, which will make the manufacturing of goods more expensive,
1487200	1493280	which will make goods more expensive for everyone. The interconnectivity of globalization
1493280	1499600	means that when one major power faces an economic crisis, the whole world faces an economic crisis.
1500240	1505200	The recent stresses on global supply lines may be enough to lead to the end of globalization,
1506240	1511920	but I have good news, sort of. Despite the gloomy headlines and events of this decade,
1512480	1515920	globalization was destined to fail, all on its own.
1516880	1524800	Globalization has done many amazing things. It has greatly reduced extreme poverty,
1524800	1530480	provided more high-tech goods at cheap prices, and created the most rapid economic growth period
1530480	1537040	in human history. But one of the byproducts of globalization is urbanization. Farmers could now
1537040	1543040	use high-tech equipment for sowing, harvesting, and processing. The need for farm hands greatly
1543040	1549200	decreased. Nearly everywhere on earth, people left rural communities and moved to the cities
1549200	1555200	for better job prospects. The dream of owning your own farm was replaced by the dream of becoming a
1555200	1562160	yuppie. While this sounds inconsequential, it had a profound effect on birth rates. On the farm,
1562960	1568720	kids are assets that provide free labor. In the city, kids are very expensive pets.
1569520	1573920	As a result, birth rates plummeted across the industrialized world.
1576000	1582560	We've talked about how globalization depends on access to safe seas, energy, raw materials,
1582560	1588320	technology, and food, but I've saved the most important ingredient for globalization for last.
1589120	1595680	People. For globalization to work, it needs a reliable supply of workers, consumers,
1595760	1600720	and investors. And due to decreased birth rates, we're running out of all of those.
1601600	1607760	When people are aged 18 to 65, they tend to be workers, consumers, taxpayers,
1607760	1613360	and investors all at the same time. But that changes when they retire. Obviously,
1613360	1619760	retired people don't work, but they also tend to reduce their consumption and stop investing.
1619760	1625440	Much of their retirement funds are pulled out of the stock market and converted into bonds or cash,
1625440	1630880	in most countries, they also receive some form of government pension. After decades of
1630880	1636400	low fertility rates, there's going to be a smaller tax population to support these pensions.
1637040	1642720	Assuming no changes are made to benefits, taxes must go up, which will reduce cash available
1642720	1648240	for consumption and investment. Smaller investment pools means less technological innovation,
1648880	1654240	and less consumption makes investing less profitable. Demographics and population
1654240	1658880	pyramids will have a wide variance from country to country, but most nations that are fully
1658880	1665200	industrialized are destined to reach a point where there are more retirees than there are workers.
1665840	1670800	Most pensions, private or public, will struggle to achieve promised payouts.
1671680	1676560	But that's not the only concern with population collapse. The Dutch government has made a helpful
1676560	1681520	list of what their country will look like when population decline really takes off.
1681600	1686320	Are you planning a career in education or residential development? That's probably a bad
1686320	1691600	idea. Planning a career in retail? That's going to be harder to do with fewer customers who are
1691600	1698320	going to be paying higher taxes to accommodate retirees. Theaters, cinemas, and concert halls
1698320	1703680	are all going to have a difficult time selling tickets when there's fewer people with smaller
1703680	1709440	disposable incomes. I love Dutch city design as much as anybody else, but that's going to be harder
1709440	1715440	to maintain with the smaller tax pool. With widespread population decline, quality of life
1715440	1722240	standards may have already peaked in 2019. In conjunction with inflation, we can expect a future
1722240	1728880	with higher taxes or reduced public benefits, possibly both. That's not all we can expect
1728880	1735040	to lose with population decline. Stanford economist Charles Jones recently authored a paper titled
1735520	1740800	The End of Economic Growth, Unintended Consequences of a Declining Population.
1741440	1746960	In the paper, Jones proposed what new economic models will look like with a declining population.
1747600	1753680	To greatly oversimplify, Jones predicts that with less people, there will be fewer technological
1753680	1760000	advancements. So much so that quality of living standards will plateau. When most people reach
1760000	1765120	for hope, when contemplating economic decline from depopulation, they look to Japan.
1766480	1771680	Japan has been dealing with the challenges of population decline for about five decades.
1774560	1780320	And their GDP per capita peaked in 2012. All things considered, that's not too bad,
1780320	1786560	but their methodology won't be replicable in other countries. To remain economically viable,
1786560	1791360	during their demographic crisis, Japan relied on a new economic strategy called
1791920	1798160	de-sourcing. Instead of manufacturing in Japan, multinational companies would rely on local
1798160	1803920	labor forces, where their products are sold. If a Toyota was sold in America, it was probably
1803920	1810720	built in America. If a Toshiba was sold in Brazil, it was probably built in Brazil. This works fine
1811520	1817280	until the client countries start experiencing their own population decline induced recession.
1817280	1821040	As workforces and customer pools start to shrink around the world,
1821040	1827520	de-sourcing will become a less viable solution, if possible at all. Additionally, Japan was already
1827520	1833280	wealthy when they started to experience population decline. They had the needed capital to pay for
1833280	1838160	all the new manufacturing hubs as part of their de-sourcing strategy. Other countries who got
1838160	1844240	old before they got rich won't be able to do the same. If you're lucky enough to live in a rich
1844240	1850400	country, your quality of life is probably already peaked and will plateau over the next few decades.
1851200	1856320	If you live in a poor country, there's a strong chance that your quality of life will decline,
1856320	1860400	but forward thinking rich countries will beg you to immigrate there.
1862160	1867520	Humanity's next chapter looks pretty grim, probably not Bronze Age collapse grim,
1867520	1874640	but the Golden Age of Globalization is coming to an end. Maybe at the end of Jones' paper,
1874640	1879360	he concluded that the economy has a way of sorting itself out during major stresses.
1880080	1886960	Who knows, maybe decreased housing costs can free up cash to invest in automation that will
1886960	1892000	save us from a worker shortage. Maybe healthier lifestyles will allow people to work beyond the
1892000	1898880	age of 65. But what do you think? Has our quality of life peaked? Or can we expect continued wealth
1898880	1904800	growth and technological advancement in the coming decades? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.
