00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,520
The device you are using to watch this video made over 100 border crossings before it reached

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,720
your hands. Raw materials were extracted in Central Asia so that individual components

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,520
could be manufactured in Taiwan, which used machinery from Central Europe to meet design

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:22,000
specifications that were drafted in South Korea, China, or the US to reach final assembly in East

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,080
Asia and made compatible to run on operating systems designed in the US. Components used in

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,240
a single iPhone rely on over 200 individual suppliers. To say that your device had to make over

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:40,560
100 border crossings before being unboxed is probably an understatement. This complex web of

8
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,440
commerce is achieved through the process of globalization. Safe shipping lanes and a global

9
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,720
commitment to international trade make this all possible. Globalization has increased the quality

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,800
of life for more people than any other economic system in human history. People around the world

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:03,680
have access to more goods at lower prices than ever before. Best of all, globalization lifted over

12
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,680
a billion people out of poverty. No other economic policy has done more for the extreme poor than

13
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:17,600
globalization. And it's all coming to an end soon. This video is largely sourced from the book

14
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,160
End Is Just The Beginning by Peter Zion. It is linked in the description.

15
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:30,400
Global trade is nothing new. Anyone who even knows just a little bit about history

16
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,480
has heard of the Silk Road or the Triangular Trade. However, these early globalization trade

17
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,360
networks lacked safe and secure passages. Piracy and kleptocracy made foreign trade incredibly

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,560
expensive and risky. Global trade was isolated within specific European empires. The English,

19
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,760
French, Spanish, and others all had their own trade networks and rarely traded with one another.

20
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,280
Of course, they would steal from each other during times of war, which happened often.

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,040
The lack of cooperation between European powers made it easier for pirates to roam the Caribbean

22
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:15,280
and Mediterranean seas. If ships could evade pirates, their cargo may still be plundered by

23
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,440
rival nations. It was quite common for competing European powers to steal each other's cargo.

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,000
The English would steal from the French, the French would steal from the Spanish,

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,960
and pirates would steal from everybody. Clashing colonial powers would make foreign trade

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:38,080
unreliable, and in turn more expensive. This would be the norm of global trade until 1945.

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:44,480
By the end of the Second World War, there would only be two global powers, each with their own

28
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,720
sphere of influence. But unlike the USSR, the United States would emerge as the world's sole

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,240
naval power. While the Soviets would hold Eastern Europe and Central Asia, America would have the

30
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:03,360
oceans. All of them. When Western Europe had their turn with controlling the global oceans,

31
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,640
that power was used exclusively to enrich the mother country. A mix of colonization and

32
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,760
state-sponsored monopolies were all designed to generate wealth for the homeland. When Americans

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,440
took control of the seas, they had a different idea. Scarred by the horrors of the World Wars,

34
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,600
the United States decided to use their naval superiority to grant free trade across all nations,

35
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,320
including their very recent enemies. Everyone could participate in this new, free global trade

36
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,400
network. The high cost of providing a global navy to keep shipping lanes safe would be paid entirely

37
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,760
by the Americans. There was only one catch to participate in this free global trade network.

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,320
You would have to be firmly anti-Soviet. Despite this geopolitical mandate, a new era of global

39
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,400
trade was unleashed. The days of cargo ships being stolen by rival nations or pirates was over.

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,560
If your country lacked natural resources or food, it could now be easily imported, without needing to

41
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,640
bow to a European colonial master. And this was just the beginning. The free trade network would

42
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,520
eventually be opened up to communist China in 1979. The golden age of globalism had arrived.

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,800
In this new era, Brits could play Nintendo, Americans could drive Volkswagen,

44
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,200
and Indians could drink Coca-Cola. But the golden age of economic growth wasn't solely due to the

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:33,040
American navy providing safe passage around the world. The World Bank and International Monetary

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,320
Fund were established to provide loans to nations that missed out on industrialization.

47
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,600
Underdeveloped nations could get low-interest loans to rapidly industrialize.

48
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,240
Of course, these loans came with political strings attached, notably anti-corruption

49
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,360
and anti-Soviet agreements. Nonetheless, these loans, in conjunction with free global trade,

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,800
ushered in an age of prosperity for both the developed and underdeveloped world.

51
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,080
Wealthy countries could offshore manufacturing to nations with cheaper labor costs and fewer

52
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,000
regulations. The underdeveloped nations would be flooded with new job opportunities,

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
and wealthy countries could get more goods at lower prices.

54
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,480
Nearly everyone outside the Soviet sphere saw their quality of life improve.

55
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,880
This era saw the fastest global economic growth in human history, at least until the next era of globalization.

56
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Mr. Gorbachev teared down this wall.

57
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:51,200
By the late 1980s, the Soviet empire began to crumble. Eastern Europe and Central Asia were

58
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,080
now allowed to join the globalized economy. While the transition from a command economy

59
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:01,440
into a free market economy made for a rough decade in the 90s, they would be winners in the long

60
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,360
run. With a reunited Germany and a strong belief that international trade results in international

61
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,760
peace, EU investments flowed towards the east. The former Warsaw Pact countries saw an explosion

62
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:19,440
of growth and even had higher growth rates than their western neighbors. Manufactured exports was

63
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,680
the name of the game for these countries, and their wealth would rise. But the end of the Cold

64
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,880
War wasn't the only thing that enhanced global trade. There is this cool new technology called the

65
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:40,240
Internet. Internet is that massive computer network, the one that's becoming really big now.

66
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:57,920
The Internet made transcontinental communication cheaper than ever before. The cost of transforming

67
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,720
a national corporation into an international one was radically cheaper. But big corporations were

68
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,880
not the only beneficiaries of the Internet. Now, small artisans could access the global market to

69
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,600
find new customers, new suppliers, and new investors. Iteric guitarists could attract audiences in the

70
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,040
Netherlands. Dominican painters could find customers in Australia, and Mexican artists

71
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:31,360
could make custom pieces for clients in China. The world was smaller, faster, cheaper, and everyone

72
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:41,680
was getting richer. Well, almost everyone. If the effects of globalization could be summarized in one

73
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:47,120
page, this is the graph to look at. Officially known as the Lachner-Millenevocht graph,

74
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:53,760
it is better known as the elephant graph. Due to its unique shape, this graph shows the international

75
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,000
wealth growth experience between the fall of the Berlin Wall to the Great Recession.

76
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,160
The left end shows the poorest of the poor, and the right end the richest of the rich.

77
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,800
The furthest left end represents people in countries who weren't able to fully

78
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,600
capitalize on globalization. They live in areas that are too remote or too unstable to have tapped

79
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:25,680
into the wealth creation caused by globalization. Moving to the right, we see tremendous growth.

80
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,000
These are the developing nations that became the real winners of globalization.

81
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,680
India, China, Mexico, and Brazil are all well known for their growth during this period,

82
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,120
but this growth wasn't limited to large countries. Smaller countries like the Dominican Republic,

83
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,400
Lithuania, Panama, and Gola, in dozens more, also experienced impressive GDP per capita growth.

84
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
Wealth generation from globalization was available to all, big and small.

85
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,920
This exceptional growth rate brought about 1.1 billion people out of extreme poverty.

86
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,160
Because of globalization, starvation and famines have become exceptionally rare.

87
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,400
People no longer have to depend on local weather for good harvest.

88
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,880
Fertilizers, high-tech agricultural equipment, and the latest advances in irrigation technology

89
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,400
can now be easily imported. The amount of tonnage yields per acre skyrocketed for almost every crop

90
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,360
in every continent. Does your country have poor soils for agricultural production?

91
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,840
No problem. Imported food is cheap and plentiful. There is no need to toil on poor land when your

92
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,920
country could specialize in something else. Because of global agricultural trade, every country in the

93
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,160
world, with five tragic exceptions, saw a decrease in deaths caused by malnutrition.

94
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,480
This all sounds like a pretty good deal. Until we start to move further right along the elephant

95
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,240
graph, the wealth growth takes a considerable nosedive. These are the low-skilled and semi-skilled

96
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,920
workers in rich countries. The working class of the Anglosphere and Western Europe would not

97
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,760
enjoy the same wealth growth as the rest of the world. And in some cases, quite the opposite.

98
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,640
These people saw their careers shipped overseas. To people who would do the same job for cheaper,

99
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,560
entire communities in the United States were left devastated by the results of globalization,

100
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,240
creating a massive region known as the Rust Belt. The factories that were once so critical in

101
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,240
winning the Second World War became shuttered in favor of cheaper labor in faraway places,

102
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,800
once thriving middle-class communities became ghettoized. This isn't unique to the United

103
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,080
States. Communities throughout the Anglosphere and Western Europe have their own version of the

104
00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:02,480
Rust Belt. Places like Southern Ontario, Willigong, Wales, Flanders, the Ruger Beat,

105
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,360
Nordpaal de Calais, and the Basque Country have all felt economic hardship from globalization.

106
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,280
Economic insecurity made the working class of rich countries hostile towards globalization.

107
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,920
Their animosity is further compounded as we continue to move right along the elephant graph.

108
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,880
On the furthest right end, we see the richest people in the richest countries getting richer.

109
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,520
This is the class of people who have been able to truly tap into the wealth creation

110
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:36,080
created by globalization. This part of the graph can be divided into two sections,

111
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:43,120
highly skilled workers and the investor class. The growth of globalization meant that brands

112
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,920
now have to compete with companies on the other side of the planet. To remain competitive in

113
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,680
the global marketplace, they need highly skilled workers. The demand for engineers,

114
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,880
researchers, marketers, designers, and other highly skilled workers greatly increased.

115
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,320
As demand for these highly skilled workers increased, so did their salaries. On the very

116
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,840
far right end of the graph is the investor class. When the world is undergoing unprecedented economic

117
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,280
growth, it's pretty easy to turn a large pile of money into an even bigger pile of money. This

118
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,480
led to resentment from the working class people in rich countries. To the people on the lower

119
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,920
trunk of the elephant, it seems like everyone in the world is getting richer, except for themselves.

120
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,440
While they lived in fear of unemployment, their fellow countrymen were enjoying exceptional

121
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,360
wealth growth. For most of the G7 nations, a strong welfare system has been put in place.

122
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,760
Even if someone loses their job due to globalization, they can still plan on receiving healthcare,

123
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,520
their kids can still go to university at reasonable costs, and they themselves can receive new training

124
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:55,840
to pursue a higher paying career. This is all paid by taxing the gains of the winners of globalization

125
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:01,920
to fund programs for the losers of globalization. Every G7 country does this to a certain extent,

126
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,840
except for one, which just so happens to be the one that pays for the global navy that makes this

127
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:15,280
all possible in the first place. Most U.S. citizens do not have a favorable opinion of

128
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:21,840
globalization. When asked if globalization is a good thing for their country, only 42% of Americans

129
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,720
answered in the affirmative. And that's not too far off from the global country average,

130
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:32,080
where only 48% of respondents think globalization is good for their country. While it would be

131
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,680
easy to say, who cares what the stupid Americans think? It should not be forgotten that the American

132
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,000
navy makes globalization possible in the first place. Without it, the bad old days of piracy

133
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,040
and theft from rival governments will make a comeback. The increased risk of stolen cargo

134
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,400
translates into increased costs for consumers. While international trade can certainly exist

135
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:59,920
on land within connected regions, shipping by sea has about one-twelfth of the cost compared

136
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,760
to land shipping, assuming they're safe passage on the seas. When the Soviet empire fell, the

137
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,360
purpose of the global American navy fell with it. America's global naval presence had one main

138
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,960
objective, keep the Soviets contained. Global trade security was just a side benefit. With the

139
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:26,160
Soviets gone, the global US navy lost its purpose. The American public's frustration with globalization

140
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,760
would become apparent during the 2016 presidential election. Near the end of his presidency,

141
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,840
George W. Bush began the lengthy negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement.

142
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:44,080
These negotiations would be continued by Barack Obama, and last his entire presidency. This would

143
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:50,480
have been a massive trade deal that included 12 Pacific countries. Combined, these 12 countries

144
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:57,520
represent about 40% of global GDP. However, the deal would face major opposition from two prominent

145
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:04,880
presidential candidates. Nobody doubts that corporations have shut down in America and gone

146
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,440
to low-wage countries. It makes sense to them. Why do they want to pay an American worker

147
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,400
15 or 20 bucks an hour when you go to Vietnam? You know what the minimum wage in Vietnam is?

148
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:22,560
It is 56 cents an hour. As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton voted for virtually every trade

149
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:30,960
agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions, millions of jobs. The Trans-Pacific

150
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:39,120
Partnership is the greatest danger yet. The TPP, as it's known, would be the death blow

151
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,840
for American manufacturing. While Bernie would not make it to the White House, Trump did. The

152
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,280
United States would formulate withdrawal from the TPP on Trump's first day of office. But

153
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,040
scuttling the TPP wasn't Trump's only anti-globalization initiative. He would live up to his campaign

154
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,920
promise on reducing trade with China by introducing new tariffs in 2018. Even with Trump out of the

155
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,360
White House, his tariffs remain. President Biden has stated that he's open to reconfiguring these

156
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,800
tariffs, but no action has been taken at the time of this video. The American public has a growing

157
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,800
skepticism of globalization and it's starting to impact elections. American taxpayers pay over

158
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,080
$150 billion every year to keep the oceans safe for free trade, and voters are questioning if it's

159
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,360
worth it. Globalization has been the best thing to happen to high-skilled workers in poor countries,

160
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,840
but the worst thing to happen to low-skilled workers in rich countries. The frustration has

161
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:43,200
led to an increased sense of nationalism and isolationism, not only in America, but in many

162
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,360
parts of the highly developed world. And that was before the 2020s.

163
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
Scientists in China are trying to determine if a new virus strain is responsible for an

164
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,520
ammonia outbreak in the city of Wuhan. Globalization may have been able to survive populism,

165
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,960
but it probably won't be able to survive the 2020s. COVID taught the world a lot of lessons,

166
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:09,840
including what happens when global supply chains are weakened. The world experienced shortages of

167
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,480
just about everything, toilet paper, lumber, new cars, any device with a microchip, all had their

168
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,240
turn in being in short supply, some of which have yet to fully recover. To see how fragile

169
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,520
the global economy actually is, let's take a look at America's greatest gift to the world,

170
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,800
blue jeans. Blue jeans are obviously a low-tech product, and one would assume it has a simple

171
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:38,480
supply chain. This would be an incorrect assumption. The cotton produced to make blue jeans probably

172
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,720
would have been grown in China, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, or Benin. The raw cotton would

173
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,280
then need to be processed into yarn. Probably in India, China, the United States, Uzbekistan,

174
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,920
or Brazil. The yarn would then need to be dyed, likely in Spain, Turkey, or Tunisia.

175
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,760
Of course, this dyeing process would rely on chemicals manufactured in Germany. The finished

176
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,840
denim would then be transported to China, Mexico, or Bangladesh to make its final assent into blue

177
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,920
jeans. Do you like your blue jeans with rivets? Then we'll need even more supply chain steps.

178
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:23,040
The ore to make those rivets need to be mined in Brazil, Peru, Namiba, Australia, or Chile. The ore

179
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:28,960
needs to be shipped to rivet factories in Germany, Turkey, or Mexico. And do you like your jeans with

180
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,400
zippers? That's a whole nother supply chain that we'll skip for now. The average pair of jeans

181
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,960
made 10 border crossings before reaching the hands of the final consumer. And that doesn't

182
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,840
account for rivets, zippers, buttons, or other add-ons. And all this just for a stinking pair of pants.

183
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,440
Electronics get way, way more complicated. But you get the idea. Despite globalization's complexity,

184
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,400
everything worked until it didn't.

185
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,000
By January 2022, pretty much every country decided that we would have to live with COVID,

186
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,040
reliable vaccines were available for everyone, and we decided to start to move back to normal.

187
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:15,280
As German Health Minister Jens Spahn said, pretty much everyone in Germany will be vaccinated,

188
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,520
recovered, or dead. Despite the Macabre Statement, this sentiment was largely agreed with across the

189
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,640
world. After two years of quarantines, the world was ready to get back to normal,

190
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,840
regardless of vaccination rates. There is one exception to this sentiment, and they just so

191
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:38,000
happened to be the second biggest player in globalization, China. At the time of this video,

192
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,080
the official stance from Beijing is that they will maintain a zero COVID policy until at least

193
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,640
2027. Zero COVID entails isolating entire buildings, neighborhoods, districts, or even cities to keep

194
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,840
COVID contained. Reliable numbers of how many people are enduring lockdowns are hard to come by,

195
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,920
but its economic impact has been felt very hard via inflation. While the rest of the world is

196
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,680
ready to get back to working and consuming, China is not, and everything is more expensive because

197
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,760
of it. Remember the earlier blue gene example? China appeared more times than any other nation

198
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,520
in the supply chain, and China is involved in way more than just blue genes. They're involved in

199
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,840
everything. The more value added a good has, the more dependency it has on China. With China's

200
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,640
zero COVID policy, inventories are low, and prices are high. Companies who are heavily reliant on

201
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,000
Chinese manufacturing are scrambling to find alternatives. China and the US have been growing

202
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,520
distant for the past six years or so, but that's being kicked into overdrive due to the zero COVID

203
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,640
policy. If your biggest trading partner isn't making anything to trade, there aren't many

204
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,520
options to consider other than trying to find a new manufacturing partner. This dilemma isn't

205
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:01,440
unique to the United States. Nearly every European and Latino publication that I've come across in

206
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:08,080
researching this is also expressing frustration with China's zero COVID stance. This is forcing

207
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,240
multinational companies to find new manufacturing partners outside of China. Rebuilding factories

208
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:20,000
in new locations will be costly and timely, but not as hard as finding a way to replace China's

209
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,040
gigantic workforce. But the good news for China is that they won't be remembered as the biggest

210
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:31,920
villains of the decade. That dishonor belongs to Russia. Now, it feels in bad taste to talk about

211
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,080
how the Ukraine war will have an impact on the global market. There are a lot of bad things

212
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,960
happening to innocent people, and it feels horrible to discuss how this will impact the price of blue

213
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,640
jeans. But this is a video about global economics, and the show must go on. The Russian invasion of

214
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,520
Ukraine will have a devastating impact on globalization, while China makes consumer goods

215
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,240
that the world can survive without, both Russia and Ukraine export something much more vital.

216
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,400
Food. Combined, the two countries export about 36% of the world's wheat supply,

217
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:11,840
and over half of the world's vegetable oils. With all food exports combined, Ukraine and Russia

218
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,880
produce nearly 12% of the world's total calories. To make matters worse, Russia is the world's

219
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,080
biggest fertilizer exporter, accounting for about 15% of the global fertilizer market.

220
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,640
At the time of this video, Ukraine has been able to still export their grain,

221
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,160
largely due to mediation brokered by Turkey. But most of the current grain exports are coming

222
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,920
from a crop supply that was planted before the invasion. Unsurprisingly, Ukrainian farmers

223
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,600
are having a hard time sowing next season's crop with an ongoing invasion. Even in parts of Ukraine

224
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,360
that are far from the front line, many farmhands have left their jobs to support the defense effort.

225
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,080
One way or another, the longer this war goes on, the more expensive food will become. But food

226
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,480
prices aren't the only thing we have to worry about from this invasion. Do you live in Europe

227
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,920
and like cheap utilities? I'm afraid I have some bad news. Chances are, if you're watching this

228
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,040
video, you are already aware of the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. While Europe isn't

229
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:18,160
actually engaged in real combat with Russia, they are certainly engaged in economic combat.

230
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:25,360
As such, Putin shut off all westward-flowing gas, and pipelines have been mysteriously sabotaged.

231
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,120
Depending on the specific nation, Europe just lost about 10-30% of their total energy supply.

232
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,000
This is going to cause more problems than just needing to wear extra clothes to stay warm.

233
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,360
In the blue jean example, Germany plays a very critical role. The production of complex machinery

234
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,600
and chemicals, the machines needed to process cotton into yarn, yarn into denim, and denim into

235
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,080
pants, can probably be traced to Germany one way or another. Germany's involvement in globalization

236
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,640
extends well beyond blue jeans. Germany has positioned itself to be the third largest

237
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,840
exporter in the world, only behind the US and China. While the United States provides services,

238
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,960
in China provides labor, Germany provides something else that is just as crucial to make

239
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,120
globalization work. Sophisticated machinery and chemicals, Germany has positioned itself to be

240
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:25,120
the leading supplier of complex machinery. Without German machinery, modern manufacturing simply

241
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,880
wanted exist. Germany's integration into globalization allowed it to emerge as the

242
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:37,040
largest economy in Europe, but there is one problem with the German economy. It needs affordable

243
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,240
energy to operate. Energy which is becoming increasingly expensive, which will make the

244
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,200
machines more expensive, which will make the manufacturing of goods more expensive,

245
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,280
which will make goods more expensive for everyone. The interconnectivity of globalization

246
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:59,600
means that when one major power faces an economic crisis, the whole world faces an economic crisis.

247
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,200
The recent stresses on global supply lines may be enough to lead to the end of globalization,

248
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,920
but I have good news, sort of. Despite the gloomy headlines and events of this decade,

249
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,920
globalization was destined to fail, all on its own.

250
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,800
Globalization has done many amazing things. It has greatly reduced extreme poverty,

251
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,480
provided more high-tech goods at cheap prices, and created the most rapid economic growth period

252
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,040
in human history. But one of the byproducts of globalization is urbanization. Farmers could now

253
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,040
use high-tech equipment for sowing, harvesting, and processing. The need for farm hands greatly

254
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:49,200
decreased. Nearly everywhere on earth, people left rural communities and moved to the cities

255
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,200
for better job prospects. The dream of owning your own farm was replaced by the dream of becoming a

256
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:02,160
yuppie. While this sounds inconsequential, it had a profound effect on birth rates. On the farm,

257
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,720
kids are assets that provide free labor. In the city, kids are very expensive pets.

258
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,920
As a result, birth rates plummeted across the industrialized world.

259
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,560
We've talked about how globalization depends on access to safe seas, energy, raw materials,

260
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,320
technology, and food, but I've saved the most important ingredient for globalization for last.

261
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,680
People. For globalization to work, it needs a reliable supply of workers, consumers,

262
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,720
and investors. And due to decreased birth rates, we're running out of all of those.

263
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:47,760
When people are aged 18 to 65, they tend to be workers, consumers, taxpayers,

264
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,360
and investors all at the same time. But that changes when they retire. Obviously,

265
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,760
retired people don't work, but they also tend to reduce their consumption and stop investing.

266
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,440
Much of their retirement funds are pulled out of the stock market and converted into bonds or cash,

267
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,880
in most countries, they also receive some form of government pension. After decades of

268
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,400
low fertility rates, there's going to be a smaller tax population to support these pensions.

269
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,720
Assuming no changes are made to benefits, taxes must go up, which will reduce cash available

270
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,240
for consumption and investment. Smaller investment pools means less technological innovation,

271
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,240
and less consumption makes investing less profitable. Demographics and population

272
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,880
pyramids will have a wide variance from country to country, but most nations that are fully

273
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,200
industrialized are destined to reach a point where there are more retirees than there are workers.

274
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,800
Most pensions, private or public, will struggle to achieve promised payouts.

275
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:56,560
But that's not the only concern with population collapse. The Dutch government has made a helpful

276
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,520
list of what their country will look like when population decline really takes off.

277
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,320
Are you planning a career in education or residential development? That's probably a bad

278
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,600
idea. Planning a career in retail? That's going to be harder to do with fewer customers who are

279
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:18,320
going to be paying higher taxes to accommodate retirees. Theaters, cinemas, and concert halls

280
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,680
are all going to have a difficult time selling tickets when there's fewer people with smaller

281
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,440
disposable incomes. I love Dutch city design as much as anybody else, but that's going to be harder

282
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:35,440
to maintain with the smaller tax pool. With widespread population decline, quality of life

283
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,240
standards may have already peaked in 2019. In conjunction with inflation, we can expect a future

284
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,880
with higher taxes or reduced public benefits, possibly both. That's not all we can expect

285
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,040
to lose with population decline. Stanford economist Charles Jones recently authored a paper titled

286
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,800
The End of Economic Growth, Unintended Consequences of a Declining Population.

287
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,960
In the paper, Jones proposed what new economic models will look like with a declining population.

288
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,680
To greatly oversimplify, Jones predicts that with less people, there will be fewer technological

289
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:20,000
advancements. So much so that quality of living standards will plateau. When most people reach

290
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,120
for hope, when contemplating economic decline from depopulation, they look to Japan.

291
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,680
Japan has been dealing with the challenges of population decline for about five decades.

292
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:40,320
And their GDP per capita peaked in 2012. All things considered, that's not too bad,

293
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:46,560
but their methodology won't be replicable in other countries. To remain economically viable,

294
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:51,360
during their demographic crisis, Japan relied on a new economic strategy called

295
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:58,160
de-sourcing. Instead of manufacturing in Japan, multinational companies would rely on local

296
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,920
labor forces, where their products are sold. If a Toyota was sold in America, it was probably

297
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:10,720
built in America. If a Toshiba was sold in Brazil, it was probably built in Brazil. This works fine

298
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,280
until the client countries start experiencing their own population decline induced recession.

299
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,040
As workforces and customer pools start to shrink around the world,

300
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:27,520
de-sourcing will become a less viable solution, if possible at all. Additionally, Japan was already

301
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,280
wealthy when they started to experience population decline. They had the needed capital to pay for

302
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,160
all the new manufacturing hubs as part of their de-sourcing strategy. Other countries who got

303
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,240
old before they got rich won't be able to do the same. If you're lucky enough to live in a rich

304
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,400
country, your quality of life is probably already peaked and will plateau over the next few decades.

305
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,320
If you live in a poor country, there's a strong chance that your quality of life will decline,

306
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,400
but forward thinking rich countries will beg you to immigrate there.

307
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:07,520
Humanity's next chapter looks pretty grim, probably not Bronze Age collapse grim,

308
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:14,640
but the Golden Age of Globalization is coming to an end. Maybe at the end of Jones' paper,

309
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,360
he concluded that the economy has a way of sorting itself out during major stresses.

310
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:26,960
Who knows, maybe decreased housing costs can free up cash to invest in automation that will

311
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,000
save us from a worker shortage. Maybe healthier lifestyles will allow people to work beyond the

312
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,880
age of 65. But what do you think? Has our quality of life peaked? Or can we expect continued wealth

313
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,800
growth and technological advancement in the coming decades? Let me know your thoughts in the comments.
