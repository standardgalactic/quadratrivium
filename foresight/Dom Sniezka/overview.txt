Checking Dom Sniezka/Michael Levin ï½œ Understanding Intelligence.txt
1. Dr. Michael E. S. McRae is a scientist who uses bioelectrical signals and other non-invasive techniques to explore the nature of consciousness. He challenges the conventional belief that consciousness arises exclusively from the brain, suggesting that any cell with similar electrical and chemical processes could potentially be conscious.

2. McRae argues that the brain is not unique in its capabilities; every cell in the body performs similar functions, particularly when it comes to bioelectricity. This raises the question of why we attribute consciousness solely to the brain.

3. The theories of consciousness often assume the brain's uniqueness without a clear explanation for it. McRae points out that if these theories apply to the brain, they should also apply to other organs in the body.

4. Consciousness, as we experience it, is likely not just a product of verbal or linguistic processes. The same applies to other potential conscious entities within our bodies, which we may not have access to or be able to communicate with.

5. McRae emphasizes that while we can make personal certainty about our own existence, everything else in science is subject to change and uncertainty.
