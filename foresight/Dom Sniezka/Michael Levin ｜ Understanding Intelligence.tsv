0	3200	What questions is biology concerned with?
3200	4720	What are the fundamental questions
4720	6320	that biology is trying to answer?
8360	10400	Well, biology is a huge field.
10400	12640	So I would say that different people
12640	13880	will have different perspectives
13880	16120	on what they think it's going to answer.
16960	21720	I will give you my favorite kind of slant on this question.
22840	27840	So I think that specifically developmental biology
27920	31720	is kind of the most magical of all the sciences.
31720	33880	And the reason I say that is because there
33880	35720	you can see in front of your eyes
35720	38720	how a quiescent oocyte,
38720	41160	a little blob of chemicals and egg, right?
41160	43960	Becomes through the process of embryonic development
43960	46760	becomes a whole organism in the case of the humans.
46760	48360	It will be a human being
48360	51120	with complex metacognitive abilities
51120	56080	and all kinds of a highly developed sense of self
56080	57840	and intelligence and all of that.
57840	61160	But all of us were once a little drop of chemicals.
61160	64160	And it is that smooth, gradual developmental process
64160	66320	that shows the emergence of mind
66320	68000	out of physics and chemistry.
68000	71480	And I can't think of a more profound problem than that.
71480	73480	And I think that's, to me,
73480	77000	that's what the majority of biology is studying.
78440	81440	Why do you think we should study biology in the first place?
82440	86440	Well, if we want to understand ourselves,
86440	89440	if we want to understand the world around us,
89440	92440	we are an example of biology.
92440	94440	Most of the things we're interested in
94440	97440	are relevant to by either examples of biology
97440	102440	or impinge on our nature as biological beings.
102440	104440	Yeah, I think we have to understand that question
104440	108440	of understanding what does it mean to be an embodied mind?
108440	111440	What does it mean to be a mind in this universe
111440	114440	with a physical body and the ability to interact with others
114440	116440	through various interfaces?
116440	117440	That's biology.
117440	119440	What else is there?
119440	121440	That's most of it.
121440	122440	So essentially, then,
122440	125440	are we concerned about the question of mind and what is mind
125440	127440	and how to better understand it?
127440	130440	And biology is just one lens of looking at it?
130440	132440	I think that's a fair statement.
132440	133440	I think that, I mean,
133440	135440	there are many interesting questions, of course,
135440	137440	but to me, the question of what does it mean
137440	139440	to be a mind in a physical universe
139440	142440	is an extremely important and interesting question.
142440	144440	And I think biology is a great lens.
144440	145440	It's an essential lens.
145440	147440	There are other lenses on that question
147440	150440	that we can approach it through artificial intelligence.
150440	153440	We can approach it through mathematics
153440	154440	and various other things,
154440	158440	but I think biology is a really essential lens on it.
158440	161440	You think it would be a worthwhile thing to investigate
161440	163440	what we mean by the mind in the first place?
163440	165440	Because you mentioned artificial intelligence.
165440	167440	You mentioned mathematics,
167440	169440	but these things are created through the human mind
169440	170440	in the first place.
170440	173440	So I think understanding what the mind is in the first place
173440	174440	would be more fundamental,
174440	177440	as opposed to looking at a true artificial intelligence
177440	178440	or mathematics,
178440	180440	since these things emerge from the human mind
180440	182440	or from human thinking or from thought in general.
182440	186440	So could we explore what we mean by the mind in the first place?
186440	188440	We can, although I want to push back on this idea
188440	191440	that these things emerge from the create,
191440	193440	that these things are created by the human mind.
193440	194440	I don't actually believe that.
195440	198440	I think that's, I think that's, I mean, it might be true
198440	201440	and it's certainly a few that a lot of people have,
201440	204440	but I don't hold to that.
204440	208440	I think that there are fundamental aspects of reality
208440	210440	with which different observers or different minds
210440	212440	will see in different ways.
212440	216440	And I don't believe we create the truths of mathematics.
216440	220440	I think that artificial intelligence is just a way
220440	225440	that we've developed to recognize
225440	227440	and interact with aspects of intelligence
227440	229440	that are unconventional intelligences
229440	233440	that are all around us in various embodiments
233440	236440	that's actually typically pretty hard for us to recognize.
236440	238440	But yeah, I don't think these things
238440	240440	are inventions of the human mind.
242440	244440	Sorry, what I meant by that is, of course,
244440	245440	like two plus two equals four,
245440	249440	that's in a way, you know, a discovery
249440	252440	as opposed to an invention when it comes to the question of
252440	254440	is maths discovered or invention?
254440	255440	So I get it from that perspective.
255440	258440	And what I meant from the artificial perspective
258440	260440	is that, you know, we've created the computer.
262440	264440	And then eventually we've reached a point
264440	266440	where there's machine learning algorithms
266440	268440	that can learn and AI and so on.
268440	269440	That's what I meant by that.
269440	271440	Or am I wrong about that?
272440	273440	Yeah, yeah, I understand.
273440	277440	I mean, I think that when,
277440	280440	here's what I think we mean when we say we created a computer.
280440	285440	There are, there are events going on all around us.
285440	290440	Some of these events are profitably interpreted as computations.
290440	295440	So we have gotten to the point where we have a pretty good set
295440	297440	of theories of how to interpret some of these events,
297440	300440	including the events going on inside of a computer
300440	303440	and some other things that we can interpret these as the results
303440	304440	of computation.
304440	305440	So that's very useful.
306440	312440	But so I'm sort of shifting the focus on the observer
312440	317440	and the interpretation of various events by an observer.
317440	319440	So somebody else can see the same events and interpret them
319440	321440	in a different way that has nothing to do with computation.
321440	323440	And in certain cases they will have more utility.
323440	326440	And in other cases, the computer view will have more utility.
326440	329440	So I think the same, you know,
329440	334440	what we're discovering are interfaces to what I really think
335440	340440	are a massive, maybe infinite pool of these kind of Platonic
340440	344440	affordances that include various laws of number theory
344440	347440	and other aspects of mathematics and the different, you know,
347440	350440	laws of computer science, what we discover are interfaces
350440	353440	to these things, physical embodiments that let us take advantage
353440	354440	of these things.
357440	360440	And why do you think we need to study that in the first place?
360440	362440	Like what's the ultimate goal, I guess,
362440	364440	or why are we studying these things in the first place?
366440	369440	Well, I guess that's part of the broader question
369440	371440	of why anybody studies anything, right?
371440	375440	There are practical, you know, there are, of course,
375440	376440	practical applications.
376440	382440	So if you want to have more, you know,
382440	384440	kind of an easier life and more free time
384440	388440	and deal with some of the vagaries of life, including disease
388440	392440	and various, you know, birth defects and disorders,
392440	395440	it's very helpful to have science and to understand engineering
395440	397440	and to be able to address some of these things
397440	400440	so that we could have a better embodied existence in life
400440	402440	and reach our full potential, right?
402440	405440	So these are practical applications, you know,
405440	409440	we're sort of born into this world having limited control
409440	412440	over how we arrive here and what kind of embodiment,
412440	413440	what kind of limitations.
413440	416440	So having science and engineering is a nice way
416440	422440	to sort of rise above those completely arbitrary limitations.
422440	424440	That's kind of the practical side of things,
424440	426440	but there are also kind of, you know,
426440	430440	these fundamental aspects with a search for meaning,
430440	432440	you know, why are we here, right?
432440	435440	So what is the point of all the blood, sweat,
435440	437440	and tears through a certain amount of life
437440	441440	if we're not going to try to gain a better understanding
441440	443440	of what's going on and how things work
443440	445440	and, you know, what we can do
445440	448440	and maybe what we should do and things like that?
448440	449440	Hmm.
449440	451440	And this kind of goes back to our previous point
451440	454440	that ultimately we're concerned about the human mind, right?
454440	455440	Understanding the human mind.
455440	461440	Well, I'm not specifically concerned about the human mind.
461440	463440	I'm concerned about mind in general.
463440	464440	Mind in general, of course.
464440	466440	The human mind is great,
466440	471440	but I think it's just one sort of cluster of points
472440	475440	in this enormous space of possible kinds of minds.
475440	477440	And I'm interested in all of them.
477440	479440	I'm interested in diverse intelligence.
479440	481440	I'm interested in different kinds of minds
481440	484440	and how to recognize them, how to relate to them,
484440	485440	and so on.
485440	487440	Mm-hmm.
487440	490440	And when you mentioned human potential,
490440	492440	what do you think the human potential is?
492440	497440	Because to me, it seems like if we went around the globe,
497440	499440	there's a lot of disorder, you could say.
499440	501440	We're destroying plants.
501440	503440	We're destroying animals unnecessarily.
503440	504440	There's war between us.
504440	507440	And to me, it seems like it's necessary for us to somehow,
507440	508440	I don't know, work together, you know,
508440	510440	cooperate between one another.
510440	514440	And yeah, what are your thoughts on that?
514440	518440	Yeah, I mean, I will preface this by saying that
518440	519440	I'll give you my thoughts.
519440	523440	I'm hardly an expert on what all of humanity should be doing.
523440	525440	I have no idea what the, you know,
525440	528440	I don't have any way of knowing what anybody should be doing.
528440	531440	So I'll just kind of give you my thoughts,
531440	536440	but, you know, take everything with a grain of salt here.
536440	539440	I think that there are two separate questions here.
539440	545440	So one question is the real question of individual potentiality.
545440	551440	So when you were born, how does one exercise
551440	553440	one's cognitive and morphological freedom?
553440	555440	So you're born in a particular body,
555440	558440	which may be a healthy body for a particular species,
558440	559440	or it may not be.
559440	562440	And so you've got certain limitations of physical embodiment
562440	567440	and of cognition that are there because of how you happen to be born.
567440	572440	And so for those of us who are, you know, human and above,
572440	576440	we may be able to say, to look at different potentials and say,
576440	578440	you know, wouldn't it be nice if things were different,
578440	581440	if I was in a different body, if I had a higher IQ,
581440	583440	if I had a healthier body, if I had a longer lifespan,
583440	585440	if I was able to do other things.
585440	589440	So part of that human potentiality is just to see,
589440	592440	can we expand the range of freedoms really?
592440	599440	I consider this the kind of the full meaning of the word freedom.
599440	601440	It's not just, right, there's local freedom,
601440	604440	which is being able to do all the things that are possible for me to do right now.
604440	607440	But there's a kind of a second order of freedom, which is, yeah,
607440	611440	but maybe I can also alter myself and my surroundings and my future
611440	614440	in a way that will enable me to do bigger and more interesting things.
614440	616440	So I'm interested in that kind of second order,
616440	621440	second order freedom through technology, regenerative medicine and so on.
621440	624440	There's that issue, but then there's the issue of society,
624440	629440	which is what happens when numerous individuals packed onto a single planet
629440	631440	start all exercising their various freedoms.
631440	633440	And we know what happens, right?
633440	637440	From the most basic interaction between animals and then hominids
637440	641440	and then modern technological humans,
641440	643440	obviously there's a lot of conflict.
643440	649440	So it's kind of beyond my pay grade to say how to reduce conflict on a global scale.
649440	657440	I have no idea, but I do believe that ultimately technology is really the only way past that
657440	661440	because ultimately the idea is to expand the physical space
661440	668440	and to expand resources to the point where there will be no point in competition,
668440	670440	there will be nothing to compete for.
670440	674440	So just imagine, right, in some level of future,
674440	679440	if you could have all the energy you needed from some sort of cheap source
679440	684440	and you could expand off-world, there really wouldn't be very much to...
684440	687440	And of course, I'm sure it would still happen for various reasons,
687440	693440	but I think there'd be a lot less conflict if we were to kind of remove those limitations.
695440	700440	And I'm just simply exploring here, but to me it does seem that we do have the science,
700440	704440	we do have the technology, we do have the scientific understanding
704440	712440	to be able to, I don't know, perhaps provide the basic resources that we need for human survival,
712440	717440	namely nutritional requirements, clothing requirements and shelter for all of us.
717440	721440	It seems to me that we do have the technology and the science to be able to do that,
721440	725440	but our fundamental problem is that we can't seem to, I don't know,
725440	727440	cooperate between one another and share this.
727440	731440	And that's, to me, it seems like the need for power, the need for greed,
731440	733440	the need for ambition and so on.
733440	738440	So to me, it seems like that would be like a more fundamental thing to concern about,
738440	740440	but I don't know, I'm just simply exploring.
740440	742440	What are your thoughts?
742440	748440	Yeah, well, the first part, I actually have no idea if we do or do not.
748440	753440	Then there's the question of what are fundamental needs?
753440	763440	So if it turned out that we could provide some level of living for everybody,
763440	769440	the question would be, is that, and if the requirement for that
769440	774440	would be to cap, right, so this kind of like, okay, so in order to have a certain standard for everybody,
774440	777440	nobody gets to go beyond a particular level.
777440	779440	So I'm not a big fan of those kind of schemes.
779440	781440	I think they turn out really badly in the end.
781440	787440	But I actually don't, I have no idea what we can or can't provide.
787440	792440	I do know that if we're going to be, you know, realistic about these things,
792440	801440	there's really what this always boils down to is some kind of,
801440	804440	I mean, I'm not even sure, you know, if we're looking for policies,
804440	811440	you know, in the end, either we are going to evolve beyond the need for such things,
811440	818440	or we're going to be exerting control over each other to make sure that something does or doesn't happen, right,
818440	820440	some sort of control.
820440	823440	I think it would be nice to get past that.
823440	826440	I think I just, those things tend to work out badly.
826440	837440	And I think technology will give us, ultimately, right, will give us the opportunity to go get around a lot of those limitations.
837440	838440	Not all of them.
838440	842440	There will be some things that are fundamental because we are within ourselves not fully aligned.
842440	849440	So each of us internally has, you know, sort of on mutually unsatisfiable constraints.
849440	852440	So I think, you know, technology is not going to fix that.
852440	860440	But the more capabilities each of us has to rise to our potential without having to exert will on somebody else,
860440	866440	I think that's the way to go for mature species going forward.
866440	874440	And what do you think are the limitations that technology can help us transcend?
874440	883440	Well, there are there are many let's start with, let's start with the fact that there's a huge pressing biomedical suffering out there.
883440	896440	So, so many people are limited in what they can do, because they have they're in various disease states right there and they're in pain, different limit limitations of the body so.
896440	905440	So that's that's enormous I get I get phone calls and emails pretty much every day now that are in the from people in the most unbelievable circumstances.
905440	923440	And so that's that's kind of to start with and it's not just for humans I think that relieving that for for the animal kingdom in general is huge right it's not just about us it's about a lot of beings with with significant sentience that are that are really having very suboptimal lives.
923440	936440	So, I think that needs to be addressed first, and then there's the broader issue of limitations so I think whatever whatever the current standard kind of IQ ranges for humans is arbitrary.
936440	949440	Nobody, nobody really, you know, this is kind of the important thing to realize about evolution that it doesn't optimize for any of the things that we value it doesn't optimize for happiness it doesn't optimize for the right level of intelligence it doesn't do any of
949440	966440	that way they tend to optimize for basically successful reproduction and biomass that that's that's it. So, so, you know, when people wonder, wonder about well, you know wouldn't aren't they're going to be real real problems if we all let's say increase our intelligence or something like that.
966440	980440	The level of intelligence we have is not some magical perfect complete level that somebody picked because it was good for us, that just happens to be where evolution stopped at the time that we became modern humans there's nothing to say that that level is better or worse than some other
980440	995440	level so so intuitively I think that we should have the freedom to to increase our understanding of the world of ourselves so so increase intelligence increase, you know, maybe maybe longevity is a part of it and I'm not not sure.
995440	1006440	But, yeah, these limitations that we have of body and mind are completely arbitrary no nobody set this up as like the the optimal point for us that we can't go past is just totally arbitrary.
1006440	1009440	Mm hmm.
1009440	1024440	And I guess that's it then isn't it we're just trying to explore these these questions. And you also mentioned happiness and well being and trying to do that.
1025440	1030440	This is the question. What is intelligence.
1030440	1046440	There are many definitions. I, you know, I don't believe that anything has just one possible way of looking at it. But for me, the most useful, the definition of intelligence that I have found most useful is basically a
1046440	1061440	that was put out by William James which is some degree of competency of reaching your goal by diverse means. So, to think about it another way, think of the spectrum and this is this is I wish I could remember who who came up with this kind of analogy I don't
1061440	1067440	remember who said at first but I think it's very good. It's the spectrum between two magnets trying to get together.
1067440	1077440	And Romeo and Juliet trying to get together. What's the difference the difference and then everything in between including autonomous vehicles of various kinds of animals, the you know minimal active matter and things like that.
1077440	1091440	It's a huge spectrum and the question is, given a set of goal states for the system, how much ingenuity is it going to put forward in getting those goals met in different circumstances when you start putting barriers in this way and things like that.
1091440	1104440	There's an extremely simple systems like magnets where you put a barrier and they're just going to stand there pressed up against the barrier they're never going to walk around and do things like this, versus systems like like like humans who have very very complex repertoires and
1104440	1118440	social spaces and physical spaces of doing things despite all sorts of perturbation and then everything in between. So for me, intelligence is purely functional it is not directly.
1118440	1124440	It is not directly tied to any of the other things we're interested in so let's say consciousness or anything like that.
1124440	1133440	It is it is purely functional competency and problem solving that's that's what I think is a useful view of intelligence.
1133440	1141440	What it's mean about the question of intelligence is, if we look at nature, if we look at the order of nature, it's quite intelligent.
1141440	1158440	And it also seems to me that humans are part of nature, our nature themselves. And then the question is, can we somehow tap into that intelligence that we observe in the natural world and use it.
1158440	1174440	Yeah, yeah, I mean, I think that step one, which a lot of people still have trouble with is really coming to grips with the notion of diverse intelligence, really, really coming to understand that we're not magical we're
1174440	1183440	not separate from the world around us that we did we as adult humans developed from a single cell.
1183440	1199440	Yeah. And so there's this smooth continuous process of, of increase of cognitive capacity over time, we are both evolutionarily and developmentally we are directly linked to to physics we were a blob of physics and chemistry at one point.
1199440	1213440	So, there's this there's this field of diverse intelligence which is trying to develop an understanding of, of how to recognize how to relate to and how to create other kinds of unfamiliar intelligences.
1213440	1226440	And this is this is a critical part of, of really using the intelligences all around the step one is to recognize that it's possible. And there are a lot of people that get very upset about.
1226440	1241440	You know, they've got this, they've got this term called anthropomorphism which I which I think is a is a magic is a you know it's basically mad you're basically saying that that humans have this sort of magic glow and that you shouldn't be kind of painting this onto onto
1241440	1253440	anything else where we're kind of different. I think that's a fundamental mistake I think step one is to understand the wide range of diverse intelligences, and then seeing what we can what we can learn in our interaction with them.
1253440	1265440	When you say diverse intelligence, like for example, for me the example of an orange tree comes up an orange tree produces oranges not apples and it's intelligent to produce oranges.
1265440	1280440	I kangaroo does something very well compared to an elephant. I'm like 11 might be greater doing something as opposed to another person. So, is that what you mean by diverse intelligence that each organism each.
1280440	1293440	No, no, okay, what do you know not really I mean that's that's that's that's part of it but but I would I would emphasize two things. One is that intelligence isn't just the idea that something does.
1293440	1310440	It reliably achieves a particular outcome. I don't that that's not enough for intelligence or that that you can get from a kind of feed forward emergence so so you know, there are many systems that follow very simple local rules and and when you sort of crank through the crank forward
1310440	1324440	in time, something very complex comes out. Yeah, that that by itself is not intelligence. Intelligence is, in my view, the key thing about intelligence is the ability to get to the same goal, despite perturbations.
1324440	1337440	So the question, the question now is, if, if we put various barriers in your way and whatever problem space you're working with, how much ingenuity do you have to do other things to take different paths to use different tools to change
1338440	1355440	your environment to do whatever you have to do to get to achieve the same result. This means that this is as an important implication. This means that you can't just see intelligence from the output, basically, and a lot of people, a lot of people
1356440	1366440	just characterize diverse intelligence this way they say, Oh, well, then you can say anything is intelligent, you know, here's a, you know, a reliably, for example,
1366440	1377440	something like something like a fractal we have a very simple formula you sort of crank through and you reiterate that formula you get this amazing beautiful picture, right look at that complexity that there you go you can call that intelligence.
1377440	1387440	That's a mischaracterization that's a straw man intelligence and diverse intelligence doesn't say that just having a complex outcome or even a reliable outcome is intelligence intelligence is the question of,
1387440	1405440	what do you do when the circumstances change do you have any ability to be flexible to solve various degrees of problems in another way. So, so for example, you know when your example of the kangaroo, just watching a kangaroo egg become a kangaroo isn't
1405440	1418440	necessarily intelligence that's just before the emergence but when you if you were to find out that, wait a minute, I can take this embryonic kangaroo like you can with human embryos and many other kind of embryos and cut it in half at an early stage,
1418440	1432440	and I don't get to have bodies I get to normal monosagotic twins, because each, each one even though you should you stuck it in a weird region of anatomical morphospace can go around and get to the place where it needs to go meaning regrow the half that's missing and you still get a kangaroo,
1432440	1447440	or when you have a salamander, and you've artificially forced the cells to be gigantic, you still get the same size salamander because fewer cells will get together and in fact we'll use new molecular mechanisms to build the organs of the correct shape and size
1447440	1462440	even though the parts are all wrong. So, now now that's that's the beginnings of intelligence the ability to change what you do to use different tools at your disposal to still get to the exact same goal, despite unpredictable novel circumstances that's problem solving
1462440	1477440	which is key, which is key to this. So, and so, and so that that's intelligence and what I mean by diverse intelligence is being open to recognizing new types of problem spaces so all kinds of things individual bacteria solve problems in in
1477440	1492440	physiological space and metabolic space slime molds solve problems in more for space and and in the chemical space humans of course solve problems in three dimensional space but also in linguistic space.
1492440	1505440	There are lots of different agents from minimal active matter to different kinds of animals and algae and bacteria and humans and you know some engineered systems on the eyes and so on.
1505440	1518440	That's diverse intelligence is being open to testing these things to see how much ingenuity they have under different perturbations, because a lot of people seem like they think that you can have feelings about this.
1518440	1533440	They'll look at a system that can't be intelligent that's you know whatever this or that. Well you can't just have these philosophical preconceptions you have to do the experiment. Somebody has to make a claim I think it has this level of intelligence in this problem space of reaching
1533440	1544440	this goal with this level of ingenuity and then we can do experiments and we can see how you're right or wrong because it have that capacity or not. This is this is meant to be an empirical science you can't we can't we can't have feelings about these things.
1544440	1548440	We have to we have to do the tests.
1548440	1553440	And you mentioned earlier on increasing human intelligence.
1553440	1559440	And why do we need to increase human intelligence would be my question. And then.
1559440	1562440	Yeah, let's begin with that question perhaps.
1562440	1567440	I have a simple, simple way to think about it. Let's say that.
1567440	1580440	Let's say that the evolution has gone slightly differently. And our generic level of of intelligence across the globe, the average was what we would currently call like 40 IQ points.
1580440	1589440	That was right that let's say we come to earth in there at all all the all the humans have an IQ of about 40. Would you say that in that case there's a need to increase intelligence.
1589440	1593440	Well, I wouldn't limit intelligence just IQ as well.
1593440	1612440	I understood but the whatever I don't I don't mean this I don't mean you know the current way of measuring and I'm just you know, a rough idea the cognitive performance so so so you know no no no art science literature of we every everybody has an IQ of what we currently associate with roughly the
1612440	1620440	level of 40 will go below I don't care 20 whatever at that point would you say that there was some benefit of increasing intelligence.
1620440	1632440	Well, I get what you're saying but my my my my that was just a like my fundamental question was, let's just say we do have the highest intelligence that we can.
1632440	1641440	What I don't know what that's but there's no so we're already I think we've already lost the game here. I don't believe there's any such thing as highest level that we can.
1641440	1654440	We have stopped evolution has stopped us at a particular level which we call plus or minus 100 right that's just what we call it, but it might have stopped earlier and it might have stopped later this is completely arbitrary is what I'm saying.
1654440	1666440	So, if you think that at a level of 40, it would have been good to go up. I'm saying the current level is not some magical special level that just happens to be where the dice stopped.
1666440	1680440	And so, for the exact same reason that you would raise it at 40 or 20, you would, you would want to raise it now. Some people might say no some people might say actually intelligence makes it harder to, you know, they say look at these animals having a lovely, you know,
1680440	1689440	it's better not to worry about the meaning of life and whatever. Okay, fair enough, I think that's, I think that's a terrible perspective but but some people do think that way.
1689440	1700440	I think we want to increase our intelligence for the exact same way that if you if we were at 40 we would want to increase our intelligence.
1700440	1716440	So, one of the fundamental problems though, we should use our intelligence to to solve. For example, it seems to me that, no matter who you are, we all care about this inward sense of happiness, joy, peace, even intelligence wisdom.
1716440	1729440	I think we all want that health and good food. What's the fundamental question that our intelligence can help us solve.
1729440	1738440	I think that, well, it's a good I mean you're basically asking I think you're basically asking for the meaning of life, because or helps us the question I'm asking.
1738440	1757440	I think so. While I'm certainly not going to claim to have the answer, certainly not for anybody else but I think that, look, when the intelligence is really low, then in a given system then it doesn't have the capacity to to to be concerned about these things right
1757440	1766440	I have this I have this concept of a cognitive light cone so the cognitive light cone is the size of the biggest goals you can possibly pursue, both in space and time.
1766440	1777440	So, so, so for really low consciousness, sorry intelligence level, your cognitive life cone is very small you're only interested in the things that are happening right now you know kind of in a certain radius.
1777440	1787440	And if your cognitive light cone is huge, you might be interested in things that are happening planet wide and that are going to be true 100 years from now and then everything in between right you got this, this this different below it.
1787440	1806440	So, I don't know I think I think the higher level of of intelligence that you have, the more capacity you might have to actually solve this problem and to, and to ask what what is the, what are the things that we should be caring about I mean part of part of
1806440	1818440	part of intelligence is is being able to set your own goals right that's a, that's a very nice capacity is not just to be a goal directed system but actually be a meta goal directed system actually be able to set your own goals.
1818440	1824440	And I think having more intelligence might let you do that better.
1824440	1832440	Right, and to have a better have a bigger perspective on, I mean we're so incredibly limited right the amount of information that we can process the amount of care.
1832440	1845440	I mean, I'm really interested in part of, and I've worked on a couple of papers with a few Buddhist scholars and we sort of think about this this issue of capacity to care.
1845440	1863440	So the current standard human is able to physically sort of care in the linear range about some number of other beings, right, it's not a super huge number but but you know you, if you know something happens to, to 1000 people and, and you know you're either
1863440	1878440	very sad or very happy about it, and then you find out that oh it's actually 10,000, you're not 10 times sadder or happier right we don't we can't scale that way. It's just after certain after certain point is just numbers you can you don't really, you know, you're not really linearly caring that much.
1878440	1896440	So one of the things that I think would happen with with an increased cognitive light cone is an increased capacity for practical care. So, so that you would actually be able to be in a functional way engaged in the well being of, of much more
1897440	1914440	many more other beings than than we are capable of now that I think is a is a critical thing to expand. And so when I say when I say expand intelligence, I don't just mean this kind of like, you know, some sort of ability to calculate or some kind of a technological capacity I'm not actually
1914440	1932440	talking about that at all. I'm talking about the the the ability to, to, to care more broadly to expand that cognitive light cone, so that you are able to mean think about, and think about this cognitive light cone right so so you've got to you've got a, you know, a tick or something, and the cognitive
1932440	1943440	light cone is tiny it's sort of all it really cares about is the local concentration of whatever chemical is attracted to. It has very little memory going backwards very little anticipatory power going forwards that cognitive light cone is very small.
1943440	1958440	Look at a dog right a dog has more memory going back a little bit of anticipation more anticipation going forward it might care about the people in the immediate family, but there is no way you're going to get that creature to care about what happens to 1000 individuals
1958440	1973440	and it sounds over five months from now. It's impossible. It's never good it's never going to happen. And so, in order for a being to be able to care about bigger, bigger issues, including more of other beings, you have to expand that cognitive light cone and I'm not sure
1973440	1979440	that can happen without I don't know any way that that could happen without an expansion of intelligence.
1979440	1986440	Could we use the word compassion or love even for what you just said that. Yeah, I think I think that's I think that's absolutely right.
1987440	2001440	The reason the reason that that I use care and concern and things like that is because I think it fundamentally has to be functional. So compassion and love I agree with you that fundamentally yes that's it it's compassion and love.
2001440	2014440	But but but a lot of people when they hear compassion and love they think it's an emotion right so so they think it's a feeling that I have and about other stuff. The feeling to me is far less important than what you actually do.
2014440	2026440	So, so to me, this idea of this is why my whole framework is sort of built around this goal directed this idea that you goals are not how you feel about stuff they're what you actually physically work towards.
2026440	2033440	They're what you expend energy, effort and intelligence to achieve. So, so, so yes, it's it's compassion and love.
2033440	2045440	It's actually care and concern in the sense that you should actually be working towards this if it's a if it's a it's a it's a you know kind of an emotional state that stays locked within you and doesn't actually impact anybody.
2045440	2060440	But you know that's that's that's useless. I'm talking about actionable ability to actually mean goals are things that you're actively capable of pursuing, not to not not not emotional states that you are capable of having, but actual goals that you can work towards.
2061440	2070440	An actual practical thing that we do, as opposed to just thinking about and not doing something we're concerned about actual action, right.
2070440	2077440	Yeah, I mean, thinking about it can be part of it. It's, it's think of the.
2077440	2087440	I think the word goal captures it pretty well if, if you say to me, my goal is, I don't know, my goal is to is to have world peace.
2087440	2097440	My next question is amazing what do you well so so how are you how are you working towards that goal. And if you say, well, I've, you know, I've sort of, I feel really nice.
2097440	2101440	I feel emotionally like it would be a great thing to have. That's it.
2101440	2110440	Well, you don't have that as a goal, you know, you might have had that as a thought or whatever but that's not a goal. You're you're you're you're you're nothing about your.
2110440	2123440	Nothing about your functionality is aimed towards that goal. A goal is something that is a state towards which you are capable of working. And some of these goals, you know, you're never going to explain world peace to a dog and
2123440	2146440	you're never going to explain the goal of guarding your house to to an aunt and and things like this. It's all of these, you know, every every creature has this kind of some kind of cognitive light cone that limits what goals are they possibly capable of pursuing.
2146440	2166440	Now, this raises a question for me. And it seems to me that the highest use of intelligence. I'm purely speaking here about the human mind, because I cannot speak for the Beatles I cannot speak for the insects I cannot speak for the dog.
2166440	2172440	I'm, I can only speak for the human mind, as that seems to be what I have access to.
2173440	2190440	It seems to me that the highest use of intelligence is to be able to exactly like you said solve any problem, but personally and also globally. And if I were to look at the largest global problem that we have, it's what you said earlier,
2190440	2206440	it's world peace. And to me, it seems like the reason why there is no world peace is because we we've divided ourselves psychologically, for example, it is clear that nationality divides people, that's what war is religion divides people.
2206440	2222440	I'm a Christian, you're a Buddhist and so on. And we have the psychological division between us. Same with politics. Same with all these things. And to me, if I were to ask, what is a good use of intelligence, it seems to me that it's necessary
2222440	2240440	to understand the fragments, the limitations, the conditioning, the beliefs that I have within me, as these create, as that creates division, and this division creates a psychological psychological barrier between me and you between I'm a whatever
2240440	2251440	country and your whatever country I'm a X religion in your Y religion and so on. And to me it seems like this psychological barrier is what is preventing us from cooperating between one another in the first place.
2251440	2266440	And if I were to ask, what is the highest use of intelligence, it seems to be to understand this mind to understand what is happiness to understand what is fear, because anything I did, anything that I do out of fear will create disorder
2266440	2284440	outwardly. Anything that I do out of anger will create a disordered action outwardly so it seems to me it's fundamental to understand what these emotions are, and why am I conditioned why my why do I have certain beliefs, why do I have certain prejudices as without understanding
2284440	2299440	that, whatever I do outwardly will be a disorder, internal disorder indicates an outward disorder. So to me it seems like I might be wrong about this but I'm just simply exploring that it's necessary to understand the inward, because without understanding
2299440	2305440	the inward, whatever we do outwardly will be a reflection of though.
2305440	2324440	Yeah, I think I think that's perfectly reasonable. I got a question though, you know, just to kind of help us calibrate our expectations with respect to world peace so imagine, imagine a world in which the earth was covered in a
2324440	2342440	population that lived in complete peace at a level of, you know, I don't know, you know, some sort of, let's say, let's say Bronze Age, or before that let's say, you know, something something earlier than that.
2342440	2360440	100,000 years, nothing happened, like literally nothing happened, no art, no science, no no no exactly the same at the end as they were at the way in, but total world peace, you know, no no no conflicts, just like, you know, peace but but but but absolutely nothing
2360440	2368440	happened, maybe go go back earlier maybe hunter gatherers or something right 100,000 years, nothing happens, and nothing's ever going to happen that's that's that's how they're going to be.
2368440	2381440	So does that sound like, would you say would you say that that was, I don't even know the vote, I don't have the vocabulary for it even but is, is that fine, or would you say there's something missing.
2381440	2387440	If if that's just how it was world peace but absolutely no product no advancement of any kind.
2388440	2398440	That was exactly my point as well, and which I didn't make make clear to me, when there is a sense of peace, when there is a sense of leisure, when there's a sense of happiness.
2398440	2407440	I'm still going to act, I'm still going to pursue knowledge, I'm going to explore technology science but I'm going to be doing it in a much more intelligent way.
2407440	2411440	So, in fact, I can, I can be way more intelligent.
2411440	2423440	If I am peaceful if I'm not doing something out of fear, if I'm not doing something out of greed, if I'm not doing something out of a sense to earn a livelihood, I'm going to have the leisure to actually pursue my genuine intellectual curiosity.
2423440	2427440	And I think we know what happens when you do this.
2427440	2441440	You're going to have excellence in whatever you pursue, whether it's pursuing basketball, whether it's pursuing the questions of biology, whether it's coming up with great design for rockets, whatever it is, I feel like we're going to be far more intelligent.
2441440	2455440	If we do reach this level of peace, if we do reach this level of happiness, if we do find out what is intelligence and how to truly use it, because then we have the leisure, the time to truly pursue our genuine intellectual curiosity.
2455440	2461440	And when you do for the love, you're going to excel, you're going to do so much better than if you're doing it out of fear.
2461440	2465440	So to me, it's the most practical thing there is.
2465440	2479440	I agree. It sounds great. And again, I have zero training or expertise in any of these issues. So I probably don't know what I'm talking about, but it seems to me that I don't know of any examples where that's happened.
2479440	2490440	So I know of examples where there have been long periods of peace with zero progress and many examples of progress that has had a lot of conflict.
2490440	2500440	I don't know what is an example of a long period of significant peace with significant progress. Maybe that exists. I have no idea.
2500440	2509440	So it would be great. That certainly sounds like the way to go. I agree with you. I don't know if that happens. I don't know how to make it happen. I don't know.
2509440	2517440	Well, to me, the only reason why I said that is because to me, it seems like these are the questions that intelligence should try to solve.
2517440	2528440	These are the questions that we should use our intelligence to pursue. Maybe these are the wrong questions, but it does seem to me that these would be quite beneficial for all of us, not just for some of us.
2528440	2533440	Yeah, yeah, I would agree with that.
2533440	2540440	So is that ultimately then what we should? Well, not we should.
2540440	2549440	Is that ultimately then what the question of biology is trying to answer?
2549440	2559440	I think what question things are trying to answer is a very person specific.
2559440	2568440	Yeah, I don't know. For some people, probably, and for many others, no. I mean, I think there are many people working in biology who would say it's got nothing to do with any of that.
2568440	2578440	There are people working in molecular biology. There are people working in just all kinds of aspects of life that they would say to them has nothing to do with any of this.
2578440	2585440	So I think that's a very dependent question on who you're talking to.
2585440	2592440	Right. But like, I think if we look at the definition of biology, I think it's the story of life, right?
2592440	2594440	Sort of.
2594440	2596440	What is it actually?
2596440	2606440	Well, that's a good question. That's great, except then that if you didn't already know what it was, and you looked it up in the dictionary and it said it's the study of life, you go, Well, that doesn't help.
2606440	2621440	Let me look up what life is because because because then then then you'll try to find out what life is, and either it will if it's if it's smart, it'll say whatever it is that biologist study that's life right which puts you into a nice circular kind of definition but that's actually the most honest
2621440	2635440	or it will try to it will try to make some kind of some kind of definition and I frankly have never heard of a good definition of life that's useful for moving your research forward.
2635440	2641440	I think that this is one of the I mean there's certainly there's certainly people who work on this and who have interesting ideas on this.
2641440	2652440	I do not, I don't spend any time trying to define life or think about what life is is or isn't I'm much more interested in the spectrum of cognition then then then what's living and versus non living.
2652440	2668440	But, but but I think it's very clear that in the natural universe, there is a class of systems, which are very good at scaling cognition from very basic things that physical systems do up through very complex kind of cognitive capacities, and we call those things
2668440	2687440	a lot of little life that's that's, you know, that that's that's basically what we do. So, yeah, I think, you know, you could you could you could say that that biology is is the study of mostly naturally evolved cognition
2687440	2689440	amplifying system something like that.
2689440	2697440	You know, that might be a definition that that that I might get behind.
2697440	2705440	And the reason why I said that was I think every knowledge branch has certain questions that they're trying to answer. For example, mathematics a certain questions.
2705440	2715440	There's of course multiple questions, but there's a specific amount of questions that mathematics is trying to answer. Same with physics, same with ecology, same with religion, same with philosophy.
2715440	2725440	And I feel like it's the same with biology or any, any knowledge branch. So my attention behind that question was to see, Okay, so for concern about biology, what are the questions that biology is trying to answer.
2725440	2738440	I mean, that seems like the whole point of studying a knowledge branch is because you're interested in certain questions, and you pursue them. And whatever questions you pursue, you can put a label on as a biologist or, you know, religion or whatever it is.
2738440	2743440	So that was the intention behind asking that question. If that makes sense. I might be wrong, but I'm just exploring.
2744440	2755440	Yeah, no, it makes sense. I mean, there are there are many, many questions in biology, you know, as far as the, the, the, the origin of living things and the, the organization of living things and
2756440	2766440	there is, there are, I think there are as many views of biologists, there are biologists, I think everybody has a different perspective on what and I think I think physics is the same is the same way.
2766440	2779440	You know, there are certain people that study physics and think that they're studying very profound philosophical questions and then other there's other physicists would think this is that's ridiculous and they should just be calculating and figuring out better ways of calculating physical events.
2779440	2784440	So they're different different lenses on the whole enterprise.
2784440	2794440	What are the questions that plague you, like what are you obsessed with? What are the questions that you're trying to answer? What makes you move every single day? Why do you do what you do?
2794440	2795440	Yeah.
2795440	2805440	Well, the question, I mean, the central question that underlies everything that I do is the question of the scaling of cognition.
2805440	2820440	I want to understand how tiny little minds work together to become bigger emergent minds and all the ways that that happens, all the ways that that fails to happen, all the ways that that goes wrong, all the ways that we could exploit it for various positive uses and so on.
2821440	2827440	As far as my own personal motivation, it's kind of two things.
2827440	2846440	Long term, I'm really interested in very foundational questions about what are the right ways to think about cognition and what are the useful lenses with which to recognize and relate to intelligences in our world and to link some of that to thought and physics and computer science and other things.
2846440	2858440	And then there's the very practical stuff, which is that I think that the right way to work in this field is to couple it tightly with empirical experiments that end up being useful.
2858440	2873440	So these are a lot of the kind of fundamental philosophical things that we work about eventually have implications to how we develop therapeutics for birth defects, for traumatic injury, for cancer, for degenerative disease.
2873440	2894440	And so, so part of my lab is very kind of basic and fundamental and and part of it is very practical applications to biomedicine that to try to, you know, try to try to elevate the condition of humans and others right now as soon as you know basically as soon as we can.
2895440	2903440	So essentially it's theoretical understanding philosophy, whatever, and also the practical aspect of things.
2903440	2904440	Yeah.
2904440	2922440	Yeah, yeah, and it's, you know, it's, it's, it's a lot to bite off and it's, it's very hard and so I don't know in the end how successful will be in either in either direction but I feel like we found a good, a good mix of things a good balance point where where the things we do on the
2923440	2934440	conceptual side actually change the way we do experiments which allows us to discover new things that hadn't been seen before and transition them into things that are in on the clinical path.
2934440	2940440	So that's, that's, you know, that's, that's what I'm interested in.
2940440	2948440	And this raises the question of consciousness then what is consciousness.
2948440	2962440	Well, yeah, it's a, it's a hard problem. What I'm going to, what I'm going to say first is that I don't do a lot of work on consciousness. I don't consider myself a consciousness researcher.
2962440	2972440	I don't at the moment have a new theory of consciousness. I know a lot of people do so there's, you know, maybe, maybe half a dozen to a dozen different theories of consciousness. I don't have a new one.
2972440	2990440	I don't have that much to add to it that people much smarter people than I have have already weighed in on this on this question so so I can say a few things about it but I don't want to give the impression that that I have a kind of a whole
2990440	3009440	new set of set of ways to look at this I one one thing I feel strongly about is that most of what we do which is a lot of really useful conceptual advances in various fields and practical applications can be done without thinking about consciousness at all.
3009440	3017440	I think that's I think that's important because consciousness is a really hard puzzle I don't think it's a non issue the way some people think you know it's a non problem.
3017440	3032440	I think I think it's actually a very important puzzle, but I think that by figuring out what you can do. I mean, the whole point of I forget who said this to but somebody said science is the ability to say something without having to say everything.
3032440	3045440	And that's really important compartmentalizing to the way that yes we can make progress on things without worrying about this very difficult question of consciousness I think that's really important is to figure out all the things where we can actually make progress without having to all first solve
3045440	3055440	this. So that's what we do. I very rarely talk about consciousness and any of the things that I write because I don't think it's required to to to move the ball forward and in these various areas.
3055440	3065440	But I do think that at some point we are going to have to we are going to have to face it. And I think just just the only just just a couple of things I can say about about consciousness.
3065440	3074440	One is that what's unique about it is in what makes it difficult is that for every other kind of science.
3074440	3083440	We may not have the answer we may not have the great, you know, sort of a great final theory, but we know the format in which the theory is going to give us answers.
3083440	3096440	It'll be a number or it'll be some set of observations or it'll be some, it'll be, we know what we're going to get a good a good theory of gravitation a good theory of computation a good theory of whatever we know what the output of these things is going to look like.
3096440	3109440	We may not know what the answer is but we know what it's going to give us that like the here's the kind of thing or theory of consciousness. It's very hard to imagine what it's going to give you because if we had a if we had a let's let's imagine we had a we had a really good a really
3109440	3119440	good successful theory of consciousness. And I showed you some kind of a system, maybe it's a, it's a, you know, it's a it's a natural animal or maybe it's one that we've engineered in some weird way.
3119440	3124440	And you and we'd say okay so use your theory of consciousness on this creature.
3124440	3133440	What does it output, because if it's going to output things about brain states, or it's going to physiology or it's going to output things about behavior.
3133440	3142440	It's not a theory of consciousness as a theory of physiology or it's a theory of behavior. So, so the question is, what does a good theory of consciousness actually output now.
3142440	3151440	The only thing to think about this is that what it actually outputs are, and this is what I think a good theory of consciousness will do.
3151440	3161440	It should output a protocol, a set of steps to put you in the same mental state to whatever extent that's possible as whatever the system you're talking about.
3161440	3171440	I think C.S. Lewis once said that if you want to describe someone being scared, don't talk about how scared they are tell me something that will scare me, and then I'll know what their state of mind is right.
3171440	3186440	So the idea is, the idea is that it doesn't it doesn't output publicly observable facts what it what it outputs is a is a protocol for putting you in a state where you can experience whatever it is and then you'll know that's what the state of consciousness is to whatever extent that's
3187440	3203440	Now that that has an important corollary which is that for all other sciences, you can do, you can do research and you can do those sciences in third person meaning that you do it, and you don't get changed by it.
3203440	3212440	So you can do an experiment and whatever you learn whatever happens to the experiment you're still the same going in and coming out of me maybe you've learned something but but but you don't have to change as part of the experiment.
3212440	3220440	So all of physics all of chemistry all of standard biology is predicated on the fact that you as an observer are separate from the system.
3220440	3228440	I don't think that you can study consciousness that way. I think the consciousness is not a thing you can you can study behavior that way you can study physical physiology that way.
3228440	3240440	But the only way to really study consciousness is to have from is to experience those things from the inside which means that you are your own experiment, which means that you are not going to be the same coming out as you are going in.
3240440	3250440	This is, you know, in sort of classical kind of a weird analogy but in classical in the sort of pre scientific terms. This is the difference between chemistry and alchemy.
3251440	3262440	The difference is that chemistry is a regular third person science you can do your experiments and you're you're the same alchemy wasn't supposed to be that alchemy was supposed to be the transformation of this of the experimenter.
3262440	3274440	You are changing and, and, and, you know, and that puts huge limitations on what you can actually achieve I think it's very limited what you can actually achieve in the true, true study of consciousness.
3274440	3286440	So, so that's that's kind of one one set of thoughts on that the the other the other set of thoughts is this and we're doing we're doing kind of a paper on this now.
3286440	3299440	If you think about the, let's say half a dozen of the most popular theories of consciousness, and you look at what they say about why it is that brains are associated with consciousness you know so they all have some kind of, you know, so one theory might be
3299440	3314440	about the microtubules and the kind of quantum processes in these microtubules and another one might be about the magnetic field of the brain, and another one might be about the way that the neurons to process information in a particular way.
3314440	3331440	Yeah, so the vast majority of those those theories, they actually don't pick out the brain as unique I mean every every cell in your body does most of the things your neurons do, and especially with with our study of bio electricity and and, and those those those related
3331440	3345440	we now see that most of what your brain does goes on in every part of the body. So, that suggests that for most of those theories, for the exact same reason you are committed to thinking that the brain is associated with consciousness.
3345440	3360440	You should be committed to other organs in your body being associated with consciousness, and there are there is no particular way that I've seen so far where one of these theories explains why it has to be the brain it can't be any of these other organs it has to be the brain.
3360440	3369440	And they sort of assume it's the brain they talk about neurons and, and then you ask them what's a neuron out well it's an electrically active cell well guess what every every cell in your body does some of that.
3369440	3384440	So, so the typical kind of the typical resistance to that people will say, well that's crazy, I'm the only one in this body I don't feel my liver is conscious.
3385440	3393440	You don't feel right, you don't feel that I'm conscious either you only feel that you're conscious your if your liver is conscious you don't have access to that any more than you have access to mine.
3393440	3399440	And of course, we don't think it's it's it's it's linguistically competent we don't think it's verbal but neither is your right hemisphere usually.
3400440	3413440	There's really no way for you to know what other consciousnesses are in your body and I'm not saying they're there because because the evidence to obtaining evidence for consciousness is extremely hard if not impossible.
3413440	3424440	But there's no way to rule it out for the same reasons you think if you think brains are conscious you should be, you should be taking very seriously the idea that you may have other body components there are as well.
3424440	3431440	So that's, that's, you know, those are about the extent of useful things I can say about consciousness.
3431440	3436440	Michael, I know we're running short in time but do you have room for one more question.
3436440	3439440	If we can do it in three minutes I do yeah.
3439440	3447440	That's going to depend on you. I guess, what do we absolutely know for certain when it comes to science.
3447440	3453440	For certain. The one thing we know for certain is that we don't know anything for certain.
3454440	3467440	I don't think we don't think we know anything for certain I think I think Descartes, he gets a lot of flak at the right, you know, nowadays but but I think he was on the right track in that I do think that we can.
3467440	3475440	We can make certain personal conclusions about our own existence. That's it. Everything else is is is is up for is up for grabs.
3475440	3477440	Yeah, wonderful.
3477440	3481440	Well, Michael, it was a pleasure. Thank you so much for taking time to do this.
3481440	3490440	Interesting conversation. Where should people go to find you to learn more about you. I know you've done podcast before link all these of course but yeah where's the best place for people to for people to go.
3490440	3508440	Yeah, well, there's nothing to learn about me but learning about the work is good, which is, you can go to www at dr Mike 11.org. So that's, that's the website that has all the papers, the data, the software, the videos, the inspiration resources, everything is there.
3508440	3511440	So you can learn about the work there.
3511440	3513440	Wonderful. Well, look, thank you so much for taking time to do this.
3513440	3514440	Thank you so much.
3514440	3516440	Yeah, good conversation. Cool. Take it easy.
3516440	3517440	Thank you.
3517440	3518440	Thanks.
