1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
I'm going to say hello and a warm welcome to the free monthly online holistic science

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,400
talks.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,400
Again, they're organised by Schumacher College in collaboration with the Field Centre.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,800
I'm Simon Rieks, having asked you where you're from, I'm in Nalsworth at the Ruskinmore Trust.

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,520
I'm the publishing manager for Ruskinmore Trust and a researcher at the Field Centre.

6
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,720
This month we are delighted to be welcoming Matt Sagal, and Matt will be presenting on

7
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:44,040
Alfred North Whitehead's Philosophy of the Organism, sorry, Philosophy of Organism.

8
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,360
I'm going to give a brief introduction to Matt, who is a process philosopher and he

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,880
teaches on process relational thought and German idealism for the Philosophy, Cosmology

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,800
and Consciousness programme at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco.

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,480
Matt's going to present on Whitehead, who's best known for his process philosophy, as

12
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,120
a broad number of applications, and you can find this, for example, in ecology, theology,

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:19,160
education, physics, economics and other such areas.

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,880
So before I hand over to Matt, there is a Q&A box that you'll find on the bottom of

15
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,960
your screen, and then if you put your questions or your comments, I will then shape those

16
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:41,280
into a discussion with Matt for you at the end of his presentation.

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,160
Please try not to put them in the chat box, try and put them in the Q&A.

18
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:56,080
Okay, Matt, a very, very warm welcome to you, we're delighted to have you with us.

19
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,280
Thanks so much, Simon.

20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:07,160
Great to be here on planet Earth somewhere, you all are, and I'm here in California.

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,360
It's a delight to be able to join Schumacher College, to meet Simon this morning, to see

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,280
Troy and Judith here, and I've been really enjoying the opportunity to teach a bit for

23
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
Schumacher.

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,840
I've talked twice now in the past, once in person at Dardington Hall, back in 2018, of

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:38,800
course on Whitehead, and then earlier this year online in Pandemic Mode, of course on

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,920
Whitehead and Gerta, and I'm doing that again later this summer.

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,120
And it's a real delight, both to work with master students at Schumacher College and

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,800
also short course participants.

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,480
I've found in teaching Whitehead that there's such a diversity of people with a diversity

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,400
of backgrounds that are interested in his work.

31
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,000
As Simon was mentioning, he's sort of touched on a whole variety of different disciplines.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,560
He's not just a philosopher, or at least his philosophy is not just relevant to other

33
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,840
philosophers, it's also meant to be an aid to our everyday lives and part of an effort

34
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:29,560
to allow us to reconnect to a universe that, you know, in the last few hundred years has

35
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:38,160
really grown in size, in magnitude, compared to what pre-modern people were used to.

36
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:44,200
And so we're in quite a novel situation, and Whitehead's philosophy of organism is

37
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,200
an attempt to make us or allow us to feel more at home here.

38
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:56,880
So I'm going to try to go into, go until the top of the hour here and run through first

39
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:05,600
a brief sort of biographical introduction to Whitehead, who he was, the trajectory of

40
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,840
his career.

41
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,000
I think that helps make sense, it helps us make sense of how it is he managed to touch

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,280
on so many aspects of, you know, contemporary human life here on planet Earth.

43
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,160
And then I want to just step back and ask the question, you know, why would we even care?

44
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
Why do we do philosophy?

45
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
Why do we do metaphysics?

46
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,880
Why is it relevant to our lives?

47
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:37,960
And then I want to spend the remaining time going into detail, introducing you to some

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,840
of Whitehead's philosophical concepts and to try to paint the picture of a world in

49
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
process.

50
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,040
He's a process philosopher, right?

51
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,600
And so I'll introduce you to some of his categories, his concepts, his new words, neologisms.

52
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,800
And after that, you'll probably be full of questions.

53
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:19,320
So all right, let me share my screen here and thumbs up, Troy or Simon, if that's good.

54
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,160
Okay, great.

55
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,600
So there he is.

56
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:32,200
Whitehead was born in Ramsgate, England in 1861.

57
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,600
And by the time he, in his late teens, you know, he's already showing a lot of promise

58
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:49,880
in mathematics and he makes his way to Cambridge University, King's College, and Trinity, excuse

59
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,960
me, not King's College, and studies math there.

60
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,520
He studies with James Clerk Maxwell's student.

61
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,920
So Maxwell, of course, invented the or discovered the electromagnetic theory and developed the

62
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,000
maths to understand the propagation of light waves.

63
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,960
And Whitehead wrote his dissertation on the electromagnetic theory.

64
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:24,320
And so from, you know, his very first academic work and research, he is bridging mathematics

65
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:34,360
and physics and this connection between the abstract domain of geometry and the concrete

66
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:41,160
physical world remains of deep interest to him throughout his career, as we'll see.

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:50,880
So in, I think, 1884 or so, 1885, he begins teaching mathematics at Cambridge.

68
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:57,800
Around 1906, he and Bertrand Russell begin to collaborate.

69
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,520
Actually Russell starts as Whitehead's student, and they, you know, very quickly realized

70
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,960
that, you know, they were peers, to some extent, and that they should be working together

71
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:19,640
on a project that climaxed in the Principia Mathematica, which was a supposed to be four

72
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:26,880
volumes and ended up being three volumes, which was an attempt to prove logically that

73
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
one plus one, in fact, equals two.

74
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,040
And we might take for granted that this is a simple formula that even, you know, elementary

75
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,000
school children can can solve.

76
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,720
But in fact, as they discovered in the course of writing this book together, there are some

77
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,240
logical paradoxes embedded in this simple formula.

78
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:58,480
We don't really have a clear definition of what a number is, much less what two numbers

79
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,720
are.

80
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,000
And so Russell and Whitehead did really, you could say, inaugurate the whole discipline

81
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,320
of analytic philosophy by developing a quite impenetrable symbolic language that costs quite

82
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,000
a bit of money for Cambridge to print.

83
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,120
I think they even asked to just to do this, the type setting.

84
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,600
I think they even asked Russell and Whitehead to chip in a little bit of their own funds

85
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,240
to print the first 500 copies.

86
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,160
The book didn't sell very well, but it was nonetheless very influential.

87
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:42,160
So that was, I think, 1911 through 1914, that these three volumes came out.

88
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:48,120
There were supposed to be a fourth volume on geometry, which was going to be mostly

89
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,600
Whitehead's contribution.

90
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:57,200
But the war started and Whitehead and Russell began to have some tension around that.

91
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:04,320
Russell, of course, would be himself dismissed from Trinity College, Cambridge for his pacifism

92
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,520
and anti-war activism.

93
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:12,640
Whitehead, I don't know that he was cheering on the war, but his son, Eric, was drafted

94
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,960
and was in the Royal Air Force, and a few years later actually would be shot down over

95
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,360
France, I believe, and died.

96
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:33,760
And so given that just the difficulty around the loss, not just for Whitehead personally,

97
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,120
but for many of the European nations during the war and Russell's, you know, you could

98
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,840
say brave pacifist stance at that point.

99
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,000
Whitehead and Russell, who were good friends, sort of had a bit of a falling out.

100
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:00,840
And at that point, there was something else brewing in the international scene of physics

101
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,240
and cosmology.

102
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,800
Albert Einstein, of course, beginning in 1905 and then in 1916, had published his special

103
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,800
and general theories of relativity.

104
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,680
And Whitehead, independently of Einstein, had already been exploring, again, this relationship

105
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,800
between math and the physical world.

106
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:29,560
Actually also in 1905, Whitehead had published this article that was called Mathematical Conceptions

107
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,880
of the Material World.

108
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:38,440
And in there, he's exploring different approaches to modeling the physical world mathematically

109
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:47,360
and he looks at four or five different models and the fourth and fifth models begin to gesture

110
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,040
towards something like a relativistic understanding of bringing space and time into a more intimate

111
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,040
relationship than had either or two been done.

112
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:06,800
But Einstein was the real genius here in bringing together some work that had already been underway

113
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:15,960
with physicists like Lorenz and Minkowski and Reiman and others, building on the development

114
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,920
of non-Euclidean geometry to totally shift and transform our understanding of space and

115
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,960
time and gravity and matter and energy.

116
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:32,520
And so Whitehead was really swept up by this Einsteinian revolution in physics in the first

117
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,440
two decades of the 20th century.

118
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,080
It brought him more and more out of just mathematics and physics and into metaphysics.

119
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:54,280
So to set the scene here, in 1916, Einstein had made some predictions about how light

120
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,840
would bend around the sun and suggested that during an eclipse, we would be able to take

121
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:05,280
photographs of the moon blocking the light of the sun and see the stars around the sun

122
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,320
and we could actually measure the parallax, the degree to which the light from the stars

123
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,400
around the sun shifted due to the warping effect of the sun's gravitation.

124
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Newton had also made a prediction that this would occur, but Einstein's prediction was

125
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,800
about, I think, twice as much as Newton's.

126
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:32,280
And so they could determine whether Einstein's theory of gravity was correct or not by observing

127
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,480
an eclipse.

128
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,000
Actually Einstein's first prediction was off.

129
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He got the math wrong.

130
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:53,640
And lucky for him, the attempt to prove his theory in 1916, it must have been, was thwarted

131
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:59,560
because, well actually it was 1914, so he had developed a theory a little bit earlier.

132
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,000
And someone went off to Russia to try to observe an eclipse that was happening then,

133
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,320
but the war started and this scientist was arrested and his equipment was impounded and

134
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,520
he couldn't run the test.

135
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,160
If he had, he would have found that Einstein's prediction was off.

136
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:22,120
So luckily that didn't occur or Einstein might have been dismissed and wouldn't be the greatest

137
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,680
genius of the 20th century.

138
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,520
Einstein has another chance to redo his math, makes a new prediction.

139
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:37,960
Sir Arthur Eddington and a team of astronomers from the Royal Society decide in 1919 that

140
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:44,920
they're going to travel to the West Coast of Africa and to Brazil to have two teams to

141
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,560
observe the eclipse in 1919.

142
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,480
They're able to take some photographic plates.

143
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
They barely got enough plates.

144
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:02,240
It was hot and the mirrors were warping and Eddington was off the coast of Africa on this

145
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,440
island where monkeys were stealing his equipment and so it was not easy to get these photographic

146
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,760
plates of the eclipse, but they managed it and Eddington makes the announcement later

147
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,480
that year in London at the Royal Society, Whitehead is in the audience.

148
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,160
Eddington says, we have confirmed Einstein's predictions, light indeed is warped by the

149
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:38,960
presence of mass because according to Einstein, space bends, space time is warped, it bends.

150
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,520
That's what many of the newspaper headlines read the next day, there were headlines like

151
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:55,600
space caught bending and Whitehead reports the theatrical environment in the hall at the Royal

152
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:06,160
Society when these men and women of science are taking in this new discovery, the universe has

153
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,480
unveiled another aspect of itself, but Whitehead has some issues with this notion of space bending

154
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:20,000
and over the next several years you would have several occasions to speak with Einstein

155
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,160
at the statesman and philosopher Lord Haldane's home in London.

156
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,000
There was a party that Haldane through invited Einstein.

157
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,480
Einstein gave a couple lectures as well at Cambridge and elsewhere and Whitehead tried to

158
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,880
talk Einstein out of his implicit metaphysics.

159
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,320
He was fine with the physics and with the new geometrical tools that Einstein had developed

160
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,760
with help from other mathematicians, but he was worried about this notion of space bending

161
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,640
because the thing about measurement is that you need a rigid ruler in order for measurement to

162
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:10,880
be accurate and Whitehead thought that if space was allowed to bend due to the presence of mass

163
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,400
which is sort of contingently spread around the universe we're in a situation where before we

164
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:21,440
can measure anything accurately we first have to know where all the mass is, but to know where

165
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:28,480
all the mass is we'd first have to measure it and so you can see how as Whitehead put it we'd

166
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,040
first have to know everything before we can know anything and you know Einstein had a response to

167
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:40,400
this that because over the the spread of the entire universe masses distributed more or less

168
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,920
evenly we don't have to worry about the warping of space over long distances,

169
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,920
Whitehead was not convinced, he thought that we needed to distinguish between space which was a

170
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,920
matter for geometers, geometry to figure out and physics, you know the mass which was what we're

171
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,680
trying to measure and if we conflate the two we end up with some logical and indeed metaphysical

172
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:14,080
paradoxes and so this set Whitehead off into metaphysics himself and he developed a whole

173
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:20,160
philosophy of nature and a cosmology which integrated relativity theory and also the

174
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,600
early some early aspects of quantum theory that were being developed in the 1920s and just as

175
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:36,000
Whitehead was beginning this work he was invited to when he was 64 I believe he was invited to come

176
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,920
to the United States to the other Cambridge, Cambridge, Massachusetts where he began lecturing

177
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,480
in the philosophy department for Harvard University. Whitehead says in his first course

178
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,000
as a professor at Harvard that it was also it has to count as his first philosophy course

179
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,560
himself, he'd never actually taken a philosophy course and here he was taking up the chair that

180
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:11,440
William James, a great American philosopher had held until like 1910 and Whitehead continues at

181
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:19,680
Harvard from 1924 until 1937 when he retires and during this time he publishes a number of books

182
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,840
on process philosophy or his so-called philosophy of organism. Process in reality

183
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,280
was published in 1929, it was actually a series of lectures he gave at the University of Edinburgh

184
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,680
so he went back across the pond to Scotland and gave the Gifford lectures and process in

185
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:50,080
reality is one of the most difficult books in the history of western philosophy. I don't recommend

186
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:56,320
that you try to read it by yourself, you may get lost and will never be seen or heard from again

187
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:05,760
in the thicket of new words and difficult arguments that Whitehead makes in that text, however

188
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,360
if you can find a group of other people who are weird enough to be interested in metaphysics,

189
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,480
studying it together is helpful, you can keep track of each other, you can speak with each other in

190
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,960
this new language that Whitehead develops and I don't mean to scare you off from studying Whitehead's

191
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:35,520
work, I just think it's important to recognize that he's really developing a new language in this

192
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,880
book and his subsequent texts which are a little bit easier to read, adventures of ideas, modes of

193
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:53,680
thought, some titles of his later books which take the dense technical and formal language of

194
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,880
process and reality and make it a little bit more digestible, but Whitehead's really trying to

195
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:06,400
develop a new language that once we learn it, it in fact alters our perception I would say

196
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:15,520
and we begin to inhabit a world that is no longer sort of the mechanistic common sense that

197
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:22,480
for the last few hundred years we've been raised to accept where we're in a sort of spatial container

198
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:32,480
with other solid objects in this container and that time is simply a measure of the change of

199
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,600
the location of these objects in this spatial container and that these objects including

200
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:45,280
we ourselves, we have no intrinsic relationship to each other, we're all what Whitehead would say,

201
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,040
we're all just externally related in this container of space bumping into each other,

202
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:57,760
that's the sort of more or less Newtonian picture that Whitehead thinks 20th century physics

203
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:07,120
completely demolishes and so let's shift them to this question of why philosophy is is even

204
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:15,280
important and you know why Whitehead was drawn into metaphysics, you know I spoke to this a bit,

205
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,960
it was he was really inspired by the Einsteinian and quantum revolutions in physics to move in

206
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,720
the philosophy but why, well because he felt that these revolutions in physics had demolished the

207
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:36,160
old mechanistic worldview, the old mechanistic metaphysics that had undergirded science since

208
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,680
its foundation in the 17th century, Whitehead refers to this as scientific materialism and it

209
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:52,160
was based on the idea, two main ideas which he refers to as the idea of simple location,

210
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,880
that a thing has simple location in space and that its location can be determined independently

211
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,160
of the location of everything else in space and the other idea would be this notion of

212
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:11,200
nature being fully present at an instant or say a bit of matter being fully present

213
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,880
at an instant so that there's sort of this notion of of matter as just this enduring lump of stuff

214
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,760
or substance would be the technical metaphysical term that just mutely endures indoors in its

215
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,200
motions through space or its endurance through time, it's just there right fully present at an

216
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,200
instant and with simple location. Now after relativity and quantum theories

217
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,240
demolished both of these notions of simple location and nature at an instant,

218
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,080
Whitehead realized that science was now advancing its theoretical understanding

219
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:01,280
almost floating in free air, floating without a metaphysical foundation and if you try to

220
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:06,480
understand quantum theory and all the the weirdness that ends up seeming

221
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
like a consequence of some of the findings of quantum theory you'll note that there's such a

222
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,680
disconnect between our common sense experience and what quantum theory is telling us like

223
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:27,520
Schrodinger's cat right in this chamber with a radioactive isotope apparently we can't know

224
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,080
whether the cat is dead or alive but it's worse than that we have to say that the cat is both dead

225
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,120
and alive at the same moment right this totally conflicts with our common sense understanding

226
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:42,000
and from Whitehead's point of view this is because we don't have we don't have the metaphysical

227
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,240
substructure to undergird our scientific understanding such that what we discover

228
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,960
in the special sciences whether it's in physics and the different aspects of physics or in biology

229
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:03,200
or in chemistry unless all of these special sciences have a metaphysical substructure

230
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,120
we don't know first of all how they all relate to each other just within science

231
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,800
but we also don't know how science itself relates to our everyday experience to our common sense

232
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:20,800
experience of being conscious agents in a world of other conscious agents who we think have some

233
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:29,120
responsibility for their actions who perceive beauty who you know have have purposes and

234
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:36,560
life goals how do we integrate the findings of contemporary science with the hardcore

235
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:44,160
presuppositions of our everyday lives Whitehead thought that the 20th century revolutions in

236
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:51,600
physics and even before that the metaphysics of scientific materialism and mechanism had

237
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,560
sort of left us in a bit of a muddle in a fragmented state because I mean before the

238
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,640
revolutions of the 20th century if you looked at mechanistic science and tried to integrate that

239
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,160
even though mechanistic science was Whitehead admitted a clear set it had a clear set of

240
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:18,240
principles everything was more or less understood the universe was a clockwork right that doesn't

241
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,400
integrate with our understanding of human life at all this is why you know Descartes an early

242
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:30,080
modern scientist had his dualism where the mechanistic world could be understood with

243
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,400
perfect precision mathematically but it was set apart from the inner realm of the human soul

244
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,840
right and this was a sort of a compromised position but as science advanced it began

245
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:50,480
to encroach more and more upon the inner life of the human soul but then in the early 20th century

246
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,840
as as this mechanistic metaphysics is called into question Whitehead seized the opportunity

247
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,000
to develop a more coherent understanding that was not dualistic that didn't separate

248
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,520
human consciousness from the rest of nature but that understood nature not as a collection of

249
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:17,760
objects blindly colliding with one another in empty space but rather came to understand nature

250
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:29,280
as a network of events you might say and this network of events is for Whitehead in in a process

251
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:38,960
of becoming that is inherently tilted towards complexity tilted toward beauty he would say

252
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,280
and when we think of nature as a a network of events

253
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:56,720
Whitehead thought that an event or an occasion a happening something like you know the the

254
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:05,600
agitation of energy described in electromagnetic theory that this was easier to bridge you know

255
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,680
the agitations of energy as a as a as a happening as an event is easier to bridge with our understanding

256
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:20,160
of experience because experience too is a happening it's not just an object in space right it is a

257
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:26,320
subject to which events are transpiring or for which events are transpiring and so in Whitehead's

258
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:34,880
universe subjectivity is understood to be pervasive not conscious self-reflective

259
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,880
you know rational consciousness such as human beings some of the time possess

260
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:52,720
um but a more basic form of experience which is uh simply the the feeling of inheriting a past and

261
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,960
anticipating a future right so every event in the universe for Whitehead is inheriting a past

262
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,800
and anticipating a future even if you think of the wavelength of light you know it's even if it's

263
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,920
highly repetitive in its inheritance of the past just repeating the same energetic pattern over

264
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,160
and over again Whitehead says well why is it repeating that pattern because it's enjoyable

265
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:23,120
right and so this is a point where many people who are perhaps more wed to the materialist worldview

266
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:27,680
and want to see human consciousness is something totally different Whitehead's going to give them

267
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:35,760
pause here and they're going to find this perhaps incredulous incredible but Whitehead found reasons

268
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:44,960
looking at and we'll go into this looking at the post Einsteinian post quantum study of physics

269
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,360
and looking at biology and evolutionary theory he found that he was justified in moving to

270
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,240
what's called a panpsychist or a pan experiential metaphysics because again his goal was not only

271
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,680
to integrate all of the sciences but to understand how science and human life can be integrated such

272
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:13,360
that the universe that we actually experience as conscious human beings would have some relationship

273
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,880
to the you know the the particles and the waves and and the galaxies and stars distant stars studied

274
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,560
by by science and so we do philosophy and metaphysics Whitehead would say

275
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:38,960
in an effort to to understand our place in the universe right and one of the best images

276
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,960
that I could find for describing Whitehead's universe was was this spider web with some

277
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:55,440
dew drops on it so rather than again a universe imagined as a spatial container with objects

278
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,280
within it I described Whitehead's universe as a network of events and Whitehead refers to events

279
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:11,680
also as actual occasions and these are actual occasions of experience right and each of these

280
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:18,080
dew drops you can imagine as an actual occasion of experience and that they exist in this network

281
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,280
or mesh work with one another is to say that just as each of these dew drops reflects all the other

282
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:33,600
dew drops each actual occasion is mirroring the rest of the universe and so there's a holographic

283
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:41,920
sense in which within each actual occasion at whatever location it happens to be in the universe

284
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:51,200
it is in fact containing within itself the entirety of its cosmic environment right and so if you

285
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:57,760
were to zoom in on any of these dew drops you'd see each of the other do do drops reflected there

286
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,640
and then if you were to zoom in on those dew drops you'd see again the repetition in a fractal

287
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,240
like way of the entire web and so there's this infinite nesting occurring in each of these

288
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:19,040
actual occasions of experience and in Whitehead's universe we're not just externally related to one

289
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:29,200
another from moment to moment we are including one another one another's pasts within ourselves

290
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,320
right and so the only problem with this web is that it it presents a sort of static picture

291
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,720
of interconnection Whitehead's understanding of the relationship among these actual occasions

292
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:51,280
of experience is in process right and so we'd have to imagine a more dynamic image whereby

293
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:59,120
these dew drops are constantly growing together into one another and then dispersing out again

294
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,840
if we think about this in human terms it's a profoundly Whitehead's is a profoundly relational

295
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:16,800
understanding of existence whereby you know as you're taking in my image and my words right now

296
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:27,040
yes it has to be translated into you know electronic pulses in a in a series of

297
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,320
transistors and and microchips and then sent across the planets wherever you are but then

298
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:40,560
it's produced through your speakers on your computer back into sound and my image is conveyed to you

299
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:47,840
and Whitehead is saying that the energy that I am expressing is absorbed by you and it actually

300
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:55,360
becomes part of you and when I get to hear your questions later you will become part of me and

301
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:04,480
that we're in this constant give and take with one another whereby we are literally making each

302
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:13,920
other from moment to moment and so it's quite a profound mesh work that challenges not only this

303
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:20,240
old idea of mechanistic physics that things exist independently of other things but it challenges

304
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:29,200
our modern sort of political and social sense of individuality at least if we take that to an

305
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,000
extreme if we were to imagine individuals existing on their own private island without

306
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,560
being constituted by their relations to others I mean it becomes quite obvious when we think about

307
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:50,640
developmental psychology and the maturation of of an infant in relationship to the mother

308
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:00,240
we can see I think in that dynamic the sense in which we really do belong to one another we really

309
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:07,360
do require our relationships with one another to be who we are as individuals and that's very

310
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:27,120
much in the spirit of Whitehead's philosophy so before even the 20th century revolutions in

311
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:33,040
science there was the first scientific revolution which was shocking enough right it begins with

312
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:42,080
Copernicus who rediscovered some ancient Pythagorean speculations about the design of the solar system

313
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:49,680
and you know Copernicus puts forward this hypothesis that actually it's not the earth

314
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:55,520
that's at the center it's the sun that's at the center and the earth like the other planets

315
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,000
is wandering in space so you know Copernicus throws the earth into motion this was profoundly

316
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,960
unsettling for you know the the medieval world to to take in and in many ways hundreds of years

317
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,000
later we're we're still grappling with the fact that we live on a planet that is in motion through

318
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:29,360
space and following Copernicus Kepler and Galileo and Newton developed laws of physics that allowed

319
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:36,560
allowed them to overcome this ancient sense of a division between the earthly and the heavenly

320
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:42,240
realms right the terrestrial and the celestial domains for Aristotle very different laws applied

321
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,760
in these two domains there was perfect motion above the sphere of the moon perfect circular motion

322
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,920
but below the sphere of the moon from the terrestrial sphere there was only imperfect

323
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,160
motion but Newton with his universal law of gravitation says note the same laws apply

324
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,760
in heaven as as as apply on earth and so modern science

325
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:20,160
inaugurates this new sense of the unity of the universe in fact and one way of looking at this

326
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,680
is to say that now post scientific revolution the earth is itself brought into heaven

327
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,640
I mean the materialistic way of saying it would be that the heavens were brought down to earth

328
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,200
but I think we can look at it either way and so you know from a contemporary cosmological point

329
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:48,400
of view Whitehead felt the urgency of providing us with a newfound sense of of where we are

330
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:57,840
right situating us in these vast expanses of space and time but just to think about our situation

331
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:07,200
in space this is a map as it were of our local galactic neighborhood with the Milky Way at the

332
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,280
center Andromeda off to the right and down a bit Andromeda is actually hurtling towards us

333
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,520
and we will collide with Andromeda at some point in the next I think

334
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:28,800
billion or two years it it might not be as catastrophic a collision as as you might

335
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,880
first assume two galaxies colliding there's a lot of space within each galaxy and while

336
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,840
the gravitational effects might distort the perfect spirals of these two galaxies

337
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:48,560
it's likely that we will survive or the earth will survive and that in fact this

338
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:55,760
the gravitational effects of this collision will seed new stars right so this whole understanding

339
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,440
of of our situation as a galaxy among other galaxies billions hundreds of billions of other

340
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,000
galaxies in our visible universe it's you know we're talking about a century here where this

341
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:16,240
has been understood and it's profoundly disorienting right there's been plenty of documentaries that

342
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,360
you know Carl Sagan maybe the first to do it and more recently people like Neil deGrasse Tyson

343
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:34,400
and others who just depict this this new story of of where we are and it's almost maybe we think

344
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,800
it's normal now we know the words you know to use to describe our situation but have we really taken

345
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:50,320
it in the magnitudes here are I think actually impossible for us to grasp we don't have the

346
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,000
the biological capacity given the proportion that our senses have evolved you know to allow us to

347
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,440
perceive I don't even I don't really think we have the imagination that is powerful enough

348
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,920
to really make sense of our scientific knowledge and for whitehead this was a problem

349
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:16,640
because if we don't have uh if we if we're not adequate if our imagination is not adequate to

350
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:24,560
our knowledge uh he he was worried that the very foundations of civilization would be unstable

351
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,560
because a civilization needs to have some sense of confidence in its purpose and to know our purpose

352
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,880
we have to know our place in the wider universe and so whitehead was very worried right about as

353
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:43,760
much as he was excited by the advances in science he was worried that there wasn't enough effort

354
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:53,040
being made to connect his uh this new cosmological story to our everyday human existence and this

355
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,240
is an attempt to depict our situation in time if that galactic map was our situation in space this

356
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:07,680
is a simulation of what happened hundreds of millions of years after the big bang as the first

357
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,400
clouds of gas condensed and gravitational forces brought them together to form stars

358
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,120
which form the first spiral galaxies

359
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,240
and so from whitehead's point of view right remember as I was describing this in the

360
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:38,080
with the spider web and the dew drops all of that space all of that time despite the the vast

361
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:45,120
magnitudes we're talking you know roughly 14 billion years back to the origin of of the visible

362
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:52,320
universe according to you know inflationary cosmology or big bang cosmology and the you know

363
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,080
hundreds of millions billions hundreds of billions of galaxies that we can observe

364
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:07,840
whitehead thinks that all of this is unfolded within each moment of our experience that it took

365
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,400
the entire history of the universe to produce each one of us right and you know we know we're

366
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:25,840
all stardust right and that even it took a second generation star to produce heavy elements through

367
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:33,840
the process of you know going supernova so that complex chemistry and the emergence of life

368
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:40,720
would be possible here on planet earth and perhaps on other planets and so whitehead really wants us

369
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:49,440
to feel the the energies and the magnitudes of this wider cosmic environment as as something

370
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:58,000
that is present within us as a potential and that is in fact giving us the strength and the power

371
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,120
to to move forward in the world as human beings in a creative way we are an expression of all of

372
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:14,160
that cosmic organization but how do we bring it down to earth how do we inhabit this planet

373
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:23,200
how do we make sense of of our situation here you know with grass and trees and clouds and the sky

374
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,280
let's hear from whitehead for the first time he says philosophy has to rescue the facts

375
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,760
as they are from the facts as they appear we view the sky at noon on a fine day it is blue

376
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,760
flooded by the light of the sun the direct fact of observation is the sun as the sole origin of

377
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,080
light and the bare heavens

378
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,480
conceive the myth of adam and eve

379
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,680
in the garden on the first day of human life

380
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,560
they watch the sunset the stars appear and low creation widens to man's view

381
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,320
the excess of light discloses facts and also conceals them

382
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,000
right and so whitehead is here pointing out the way that

383
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,680
there's more to the universe than what at first meets the eye which is why the scientific

384
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:43,440
process of discovery is so exciting and so with lauren we think we have understood something and

385
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,360
we continue to study it and then there's a deeper layer which reveals itself

386
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,960
from whitehead's point of view this process of discovery is unending

387
00:43:53,600 --> 00:44:00,080
because the universe isn't just a finished object it's not a the big bang is not something

388
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:08,000
which occurred 14 billion years ago and then finished right it's still banging the universe

389
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:16,400
is still in the process of creating itself and we as scientific observers are a part of that

390
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,000
creative process and so in a universe of creative process we will never be done

391
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,320
knowing right knowing itself must remain an open-ended process

392
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:36,480
and whitehead wants to invite us into a new understanding of knowledge right and

393
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:44,160
this is where his understanding of science and philosophy relates to

394
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,880
education he was an educational reformer who while he was always teaching mathematics and

395
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,200
philosophy he was also involved in administration trying to shape the modern research university

396
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,840
to provide a holistic education for for its students so that students who majored in science

397
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,600
would also also take courses in literature and humanities and vice versa he thought that if

398
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,000
someone were to graduate from university only having studied engineering without any sense of

399
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:28,000
you know Shakespeare or without any exposure to to to Kant and the history of philosophy that

400
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:36,960
it really diminishes our outlook on the nature of reality and so for whitehead knowledge is really

401
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:43,920
important but it's a side issue the important thing is learning right and the process of learning

402
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,600
we do learn in order to come to possess knowledge but in whitehead's view we have to be willing

403
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,600
to not be possessive over our knowledge because it's going to constantly need to be updated

404
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:04,000
and expanded and so you know we could think of his view of of of science and the scientific

405
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,880
investigation into nature is not an effort to produce knowledge as though the universe were

406
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,560
just some fixed already completed collection of objects out there but science is really about

407
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:24,560
this ongoing process of learning and that in in many ways it is an end in itself right it's not

408
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,080
that we investigate as a means to arrive at some end where we will then possess the complete

409
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:39,120
and and final understanding of everything science is the process of learning the process of

410
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:48,320
discovery is itself the end right and we need to whitehead would say be content to remain in wonder

411
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,240
at this universe and ourselves are placed within this universe to pursue science

412
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:59,120
as an infinite task right rather than something that could finally be completed

413
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:06,560
you know whitehead says i often start my talks on whitehead with this quote but i'll give it to

414
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:16,160
you now that echoing Aristotle he says philosophy begins in wonder but whitehead adds at the end

415
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:22,480
when philosophic thought has done its best the wonder remains right and so the goal of the

416
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:31,360
philosopher is not to replace wonder with explanation to explain away wonder right by reference to

417
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:39,520
whatever mechanism might be favored in a particular era rather the goal of the philosopher and the

418
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:51,200
scientist is to elucidate and and bring some understanding to our experience of wonder but

419
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:58,160
that experience will always remain it cannot be explained away right and if science begins to

420
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:04,960
explain away the wonder for whitehead that's a pretty good indication that it has become dogmatic

421
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:12,400
and needs to be it needs the critic the critique of a philosopher to remind

422
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,920
to remind it that in fact we inhabit a creative universe

423
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:28,000
it's one more powerful line from whitehead and then we'll get into some of the details of his

424
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:36,080
metaphysics you know what i only have like five minutes left so we'll have to i'll give you the

425
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:44,240
quicker version of whiteheads entire metaphysical scheme so whitehead says in our experience there

426
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:52,880
is always the dim background from which we derive and to which we return we are not enjoying a limited

427
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,880
doll's house of clear and distinct things secluded from all ambiguity in the darkness beyond

428
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:09,360
there ever looms the vague mass which is the universe begetting us right and so for whitehead

429
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:16,960
this vague mass is what he calls creativity right it is this ultimate metaphysical category for him

430
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,360
and everything that we see around us everything that we experience in ourselves is an expression

431
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:32,080
of this creativity it's this creativity taking the form of temporary products right so creativity

432
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:42,480
is infinite productivity and then our bodies planets stars these are temporary sort of

433
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:52,080
achievements of creativity which enjoy themselves as they arise but then perish back into this

434
00:49:52,800 --> 00:50:00,240
creative process but they perish back into the creative process gifting their experience back

435
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,640
to the whole such that the process of the universe is unfolding for whitehead is i would call it

436
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:11,600
cumulative right there's a memory bank and everything that happens in the universe gets added

437
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:18,800
to that memory bank so that the next moment to arise has this storehouse of experience to

438
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:30,480
draw upon to advance the universe one step further right so this is going to be quick

439
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:38,320
and do not expect to have by the end of this five minutes mastered whitehead's technical jargon here

440
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,960
but i want to use this illustration to introduce you to some of his concepts here this is

441
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:48,560
these are some daffodils and i'm going to explain the process of concrescence to you

442
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:55,680
concrescence is whitehead's term for how creativity or infinite productivity becomes

443
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,960
a finite product concrescence is that process whereby the infinite becomes finite but only

444
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:08,960
for a moment because the finite entity which has concrest immediately perishes back into

445
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,600
this you know dim background from out of which we arise and perish

446
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,400
so if we turn these daffodils on their side we can use them to illustrate illustrate

447
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:26,640
concrescence which whitehead defines as in terms of this i think almost magical formula

448
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:33,360
um concrescence is the process whereby the many become one and are increased by one

449
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:42,560
what does that mean well the many are perished objects in the past environment so the daffodils

450
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:49,040
here are let's say an actual occasion of experience right and each actual occasion of experience

451
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:54,720
begins by inheriting perished objects in its past environment

452
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,200
now in addition to the past environment whitehead also had this realm of what he called eternal

453
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:10,720
objects these are like platonic forms but unlike Plato's forms whitehead didn't privilege this realm

454
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,840
of eternal objects as the preeminent actualities right for Plato the forms were the most real

455
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:23,600
things that there were and the actual world was a pale imitation whitehead totally inverts that

456
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:29,760
picture these eternal objects for whitehead become deficient in actuality he says they're

457
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:38,320
pure potentials but they long for actualization and they're pure potentials so that they provide

458
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,680
the different forms of definiteness that become actual in an actual occasion of experience so

459
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,640
colors shapes sounds they're they're sort of like the adjectives that characterize our experience

460
00:52:55,120 --> 00:53:00,320
so every actual occasion has these two poles to it a physical pole

461
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:11,040
and a mental pole right and so everything down to um subatomic particles and the most

462
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:17,920
trivial puff of existence and far off empty space up to um each moment of our conscious human

463
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:23,040
experience is an actual occasion which has a physical pole and a mental pole though for

464
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:31,200
very simple occasions like those associated you know with photons or protons or subatomic particles

465
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:37,040
these occasions are mostly dominated by their physical pole right which is to say that

466
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:46,000
they're repeating what has occurred in their past without much innovation now an occasion inherits

467
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,840
its past via what whitehead calls a prehension and a prehension is a feeling right prehensions are

468
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:02,080
the process whereby the past is allowed the objectified past right the perished past is allowed

469
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:08,560
entry again into the into the present to be felt by this concussing occasion of experience

470
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,960
now eternal objects are not you could say they're prehended they're conceptual prehensions but

471
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:24,240
whitehead also has a term for this called ingression so these pure potentials ingress into the mental

472
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:31,040
pole of an occasion to allow this occasion to again characterize what is it what it has inherited

473
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,920
from its past environment now without the ingression of eternal objects to provide

474
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:44,480
an actual occasion uh with some novelty some alternative ways of characterizing what it

475
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,600
is inheriting from its past then there would only be repetition right in each of these

476
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:57,760
occasions of experience and so the ingression of eternal objects provides some source of novelty

477
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:03,520
in the mental pole of an occasion so that it can innovate upon what it is inheriting from

478
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:10,720
its past but again simpler forms of experience say in the inorganic world they don't ingress much

479
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:20,640
novelty they mostly repeat the past right it's only more complex living organisms and multicellular

480
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:29,600
animals like like you know mammals and primates and humans who can ingress um these pure potentials

481
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:36,960
so as to you know really radically shift um from from what we inherit from the past and

482
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,600
do something totally new almost free we might say um freedom something like freedom seems to become

483
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:50,800
possible uh in in human beings we don't just have to repeat the past anymore but again the

484
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:58,400
inorganic world does mostly repeat the prehensions of its past which is why um physics can develop

485
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:05,360
such reliable um lawful descriptions of what happens in the inorganic world whereas it's very

486
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:12,000
difficult to um predicts how a human being will behave in a new situation but even us we still

487
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,800
have some degree of habituality right in our behavior but nonetheless we ingress we ingress

488
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:27,440
these pure potentials and are capable of quite a bit of novelty now this term subjective form is

489
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,840
whitehead's way of talking about the emotional quality that of occasion experiences as it begins

490
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:38,960
to inherit its past how does it feel about that past right that's the subjective form

491
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:48,560
and then the subjective aim is how in the process of uh concresing the various prehensions of the

492
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:56,000
past are led to grow together and and any conflict between them between the feelings of the past

493
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:02,640
is brought into contrast whitehead says and harmonized like notes in a chord that is struck

494
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:08,560
and so the subjective aim allows the the many of the past to grow together into a new one

495
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:17,840
right and achieve satisfaction as this new subject which for whitehead as soon as that

496
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:24,720
new subjective point of view is achieved it perishes right and becomes a superject

497
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:38,160
and this superject uh is a subject's way of um of persisting into the future of gifting itself

498
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:44,720
and the value that it has realized in its process of concrescence to the future so that it becoming

499
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,760
a part of the universe again can be taken up by the next moment of concrescence right so

500
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,200
the last thing I want to say about this is if we think about it um at the level of our own

501
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,080
psychology as human beings this this process of concrescence is meant to apply at multiple levels

502
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:06,960
right it's the it applies at the simplest level of of a wavelength of light and electromagnetic

503
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:16,160
propagation uh as it does to our stream of consciousness you know for for we psychologically

504
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:26,000
psychologically um complex human beings and what it what whitehead is suggesting in in our case is

505
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,080
the reverse of of the Cartesian understanding where Descartes said I think therefore I am right

506
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:41,920
which implies that there's an already existing subject me who has experiences right and or has

507
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:50,160
thoughts and these thoughts sort of um they qualify um my substantial self but my substantial

508
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:55,280
self the subject that I am pre-exists my experiences of objects in the environment

509
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,520
and um sort of persists as the same entity throughout my life whitehead is saying

510
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:09,920
that actually in each moment of my experience a new subject is emerging and rather than a

511
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,400
pre-existing subject having experience of objects in whitehead's universe the perished objects of

512
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:26,400
the past are growing together and being concrest into a new subject so a new subject grows out of

513
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:33,440
the perished objects of the past allowing the past which is finished and perished right to

514
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,280
to move again into the future um through the present and so each present moment of our subjective

515
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:47,520
experience is the result of the growing together of these objects and so whitehead says he says no

516
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:53,440
thinker thinks twice right and if if you're familiar with the first process philosopher

517
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:59,760
Heraclitus he says uh you can't step into the same river twice well whitehead is extending this

518
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,080
principle of process philosophy into our own conscious experience no thinker thinks twice

519
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:14,240
or we could say no subject experiences twice right because each moment the subject of perspective

520
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:21,600
that we are is arising out of our environment experiencing and itself as a new perspective

521
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:27,280
enjoying that perspective and then that perspective perishes and becomes an object for the next

522
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:35,040
moment to inherit and so in whitehead's view my identity my personality my sense of a flow of

523
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:42,480
consciousness is actually a whole series of these actual occasions a historical root he says of

524
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:48,320
these occasions which are in the case of my own consciousness intimately related to one another

525
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:56,000
in a way that you know my historical root is not as intimately woven together as

526
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:03,760
with your historical root and so we each have our own sort of flow of consciousness because we each

527
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:10,560
are composed of a of a distinct chain of actual occasions which are inheriting from one another

528
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:19,040
and so a human soul in whitehead's view becomes something that needs to be understood as a sort

529
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:26,560
of pulsing process of coming right rather than a substantial ego as it was as it was in Descartes

530
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:33,840
view we're more of a process right and we are a process that is constantly enfolding the environment

531
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:40,880
into us right and so we're not separate from the environment we are the environment

532
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:48,960
coming to take a subjective perspective upon itself it's a radically different view of who

533
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:59,200
and what we are from the typical Cartesian perspective so I will I will stop with that

534
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:09,200
I'm sure you are I'm sure your heads are spinning that's a good thing this is a very novel perspective

535
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:15,120
on reality and so if you're not confused then you probably didn't hear me but I'm happy to

536
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,280
discuss this with you and answer some of your questions so thanks for your attention

537
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,880
I'll stop sharing my screen here too there we go

538
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:34,800
so Matt I want to thank you very much for the first of all for the invitation into the confusion

539
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:41,920
but also for the clarity that you brought I really appreciate your introducing of white heads

540
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,480
biography and then deepening into the philosophy I get a sense of somebody who

541
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:52,560
wants to develop a language to enable a new seeing of the world but one that is corroborated by

542
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:59,120
science at the same time and it also gives the human being this this creative knowing

543
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:04,560
it has creative knowing and the process of becoming back to the human being

544
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:09,920
yes good so

545
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,240
the next session we're going to come we're going to give over to a discussion

546
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:19,920
and I've got some questions that have come in from the participants

547
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:29,040
and this is Jason and he's saying concerning whitehead and Einstein developing mathematical

548
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:35,680
physics this is to say that math wasn't really meaningfully applied to physics

549
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:41,040
or to the study of the material world before this point what does it mean more broadly to

550
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:49,360
have begun to conceive the world abstractly at this time yeah very good question

551
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:55,920
um no it's not to say that math isn't meaningfully applied to physics

552
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:01,520
there would be no modern physics if we couldn't meaningfully apply math

553
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:12,160
and you know whitehead was in in being critical of Einstein wasn't trying to say

554
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:22,080
that we cannot use mathematics to model the physical world he was simply

555
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:29,360
trying to suggest that we must be careful not to mistake the model the mathematical model

556
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:37,360
for the reality and so in the case of Einstein whitehead did not deny the practical utility

557
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:47,200
of a four-dimensional geometric manifold for making predictions about how bodies masses

558
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:54,080
move in space. Einstein's equations are very accurate in the predictions that they make

559
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:03,360
about large masses in space and in fact in space time even his his understanding of the

560
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:10,480
relativity of space and time has been tested by synchronizing clocks very accurate clocks putting

561
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,760
one of them in an airplane flying around for a while and coming back to look at the to compare

562
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:22,560
the two clocks the clock that moves in the airplane is slower relative to the clock that

563
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:29,840
remained on earth we've tested this so the the faster that an object moves apparently the slower

564
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:41,280
that time passes for it relative to a stationary observer so the consequences of some of Einstein's

565
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:49,600
equations while they may be difficult for us to grasp and imagine are nonetheless many of them

566
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:59,040
experimentally proven now but the question still remains given the physical accuracy of

567
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:05,920
Einstein's mathematical models what's going on metaphysically what is the relationship between

568
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:14,720
the model and the reality now one of the issues that whitehead has with Einstein is in he would

569
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,880
describe it in terms of what he called the fallacy of misplaced concreteness many people who have

570
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:28,880
not read whitehead directly have probably seen him cited in other works with with regard to this

571
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:33,280
fallacy of misplaced concreteness and this is just precisely to mistake the model for the reality

572
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:40,880
if Einstein's model of spacetime is correct in other words not just correct but if it is in fact

573
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:46,960
if there is no difference between the model and the reality then that says something about our

574
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:53,280
our human conscious experience of a flow of time it says that it's an illusion basically

575
01:06:53,840 --> 01:07:01,040
and Einstein repeated this notion you know he famously wrote in a in a letter to one of his

576
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:10,320
best friends widows that upon the death of his best friend that you know for us believing physicists

577
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,120
the difference between the past the present and the future is nothing but a stubbornly persistent

578
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:23,600
illusion now for whitehead this is no basis for a purposeful human life to take that point of

579
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:30,320
view seriously and so whitehead like some other 20th century philosophers disagreed with Einstein

580
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:38,160
not about the accuracy of of his new model for making predictions but about the metaphysical

581
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:48,720
interpretation that Einstein was giving it Birxon Henri Birxon the the French philosopher had a

582
01:07:48,720 --> 01:07:55,840
debate with Einstein in 1922 about the nature of time and and Birxon wanted to say hey we can only

583
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:04,800
do science because we are conscious beings and all the dials and meters and and doing the math it

584
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:10,880
all presupposes conscious human beings right um a clock can't get itself read without a conscious

585
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:19,200
human being to to look at it and for Birxon as for whitehead there's a a time a process of unfolding

586
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:27,600
that is um anterior to or prior to the time that is measured on clocks by physicists

587
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,840
and Einstein did not like this idea he didn't want to cede any territory to the metaphysicians

588
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:41,120
claiming this um concrete time of becoming as somehow primary but if we don't recognize this

589
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:47,520
time as primary as concrete then we lose ourselves in the abstractions of the model and we we begin

590
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:53,920
to denigrate the deliverances of our concrete experience by reference to the model which we

591
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:01,200
are told is what's real and so whitehead is just saying to Einstein and he's not saying we can't

592
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:07,040
use the tools of math to understand the physical world he's saying do not forget that we're dealing

593
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:13,920
with models and that um there's more to the concrete becoming of the universe than any model can capture

594
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:24,960
so hopefully that helps with that question. Matt thank you that also there was also another

595
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:30,000
question on Birxon but we've touched on Birxon a little bit um I want to go from the west to the

596
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,080
east we've got two questions around and this is normally this is quite a popular question

597
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:41,440
around western philosophers this um this this genre of question so and this comes from Jurgen

598
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:46,240
and also from Dennis what would you say about the connection between whitehead and eastern thought

599
01:09:46,240 --> 01:09:52,960
say Taoism to me it seems almost as if whitehead is dressing Taoism in western language there's

600
01:09:52,960 --> 01:10:01,360
a friendly smiley face after that one I should explain um and then also yeah does whiteheads

601
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:07,520
philosophy relate to the I'm sorry how does whiteheads philosophy relate to the Hindu-Vedic

602
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:13,440
cosmological concept of Indra's net or web if that is something you are familiar with.

603
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:21,520
Yeah um great questions Indra's net is precisely what I was attempting to illustrate

604
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:29,600
with my spider web with dew drops on it that is certainly an apt metaphor for whitehead's

605
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:36,960
cosmology with the caveat that we have to throw it into motion and make it more dynamic.

606
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:45,040
Whitehead's universe is not simply not that it's simple it's not simply though a holographic

607
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:52,160
universe wherein each part reflects the whole um it's also a creative advance whereby again

608
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:57,680
remember the definition of concrescence the many become one and are increased by one so the universe

609
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:06,960
is this um cumulative process that is continually growing the universe is never the same twice

610
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,600
and so when we think about the universe as a whole as all of these occasions of experience

611
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:21,600
reflecting or mirroring or containing one another there's also new occasions of experience

612
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,800
constantly being birthed which contain the entire past but carry it forward into the next moment

613
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:33,840
so it's much like Indra's net though with this dynamic tilt toward toward the future toward

614
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:40,480
toward the as yet unrealized future and you know in terms of the broader connections to

615
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:46,400
eastern thought uh eastern religion and philosophy whitehead says himself in

616
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:57,600
process and reality that his metaphysics resembles more um Vedic and and Buddhist forms

617
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:04,480
of thought than it does um anything in western philosophy uh or in the Judeo-Christian religious

618
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:14,800
traditions um and so he was quite aware of this he didn't study Taoism or Buddhism in any depth

619
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:22,080
so far as I know um he did write a book called religion in the making which was published shortly

620
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:30,080
after process in reality where it's clear he had done some reading in Buddhism he was impressed

621
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:37,680
enough by the Buddhist tradition to say that it qualifies as what he called one of the rational

622
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:50,560
religions and he certainly his his notion of of flux and impermanence right has quite a a

623
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:55,680
similarity to the the Buddhist notion of you know impermanence or emptiness

624
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:03,440
um the relationship of these dew drops on the web is also something you can describe as a relationship

625
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:11,440
of dependent co-origination uh which is an important concept uh for certain um Mahayana

626
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:20,080
Buddhist traditions and in the contemporary worlds um actually whitehead's work is being taken up

627
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:30,800
um by China uh there are something like 35 graduate programs in China devoted to process

628
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:37,520
philosophy and and whitehead's thought um two billion people 35 graduate programs so it's you

629
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:44,000
know a lot of people but still that's a lot of whitehead in China and I think there are several

630
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,480
reasons that the Chinese are so interested in whitehead's thought one is that yeah it fits naturally

631
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:55,280
with um the the Taoist and Confucian Buddhist traditions there but

632
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,680
my understanding is that uh you know the communist party is a little bit hesitant to

633
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:07,760
allow in those more ancient traditions and to they want to be modern and whitehead affords them

634
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:13,600
the opportunity to to be modern with his understanding of science and you know he's coming from the west

635
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:21,200
um but while still tapping into these these deeper um traditional understandings of

636
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:28,000
of the the nature of the universe as as Lao Tzu and Shuang Tzu and Confucius um

637
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:33,360
not that Taoism and Confucianism are the same but there are some similarities there

638
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:42,000
whitehead's thought allows uh China to in a way get in touch with its own history while also

639
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:48,400
moving more into the modern world and so his thought is exploding there I think precisely

640
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:52,880
because of the resonances that that are being remarked upon in these in these questions

641
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:01,120
Matt thank you uh I want to go in a different direction now and this is what to do with with

642
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:07,520
panpsychism and possibly consciousness studies and this is from Dennis who's saying Matt in your view

643
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:14,640
what does it mean to experience and the sub question from that is can particles experience

644
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:23,920
yeah good question this is a major stumbling block uh for many people who are new to whitehead's

645
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:29,840
thought though um what's sometimes called panpsychism is actually undergoing a bit of a renaissance

646
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:37,920
right now um even in analytic philosophy more philosophers of mind are taking this

647
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:46,000
idea seriously um even in the last five or ten years than ever before um whitehead's not the

648
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:55,360
first panpsychist obviously um Leibniz uh was a was a panpsychist um Giordano Bruno one of the

649
01:15:55,360 --> 01:16:01,520
early modern scientists was a panpsychist um and so there's a there's a sort of venerable tradition

650
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:08,560
here it's a sort of um marginalized yes but still um readily uh visible stream in the history of

651
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:15,360
western thought even Heraclitus processed philosophy yes right um everything is flux

652
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:21,920
but Heraclitus also referred to everything as he says the universe is an ever-living fire

653
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,880
and so in other words life goes all the way down right life isn't something that just emerges

654
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:37,440
atop a physical substrate um and so for whitehead he protested against what he called the notion of

655
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:45,920
vacuous actuality a vacuous actuality would be um some sort of an entity which is imagined to exist

656
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,840
independently of experience whether its own experience or being experienced by someone else

657
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:59,120
he thinks it's a meaningless notion and the reason panpsychism is becoming

658
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:09,920
is coming more into the mainstream academic uh philosophical uh arena is because of the

659
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:17,200
difficulty of this hard problem of consciousness right which is if we do inhabit a physical world

660
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:24,640
that is not experiential at what point does something like conscious experience

661
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:34,400
arise or emerge um and and how does it emerge right if if in the physical world you have parts

662
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:41,440
that just rearrange their relative location to one another um and just mutely persist right as

663
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:49,600
these substantial bits um how is it that surely through a rearrangement of those inert parts

664
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:55,440
you could ever get something like an interior experience right or or uh experience of what

665
01:17:55,440 --> 01:18:03,440
it's like to be somebody um it seems like not only a hard problem but an impossible problem

666
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:09,440
and so panpsychism is an attempt not so much to solve the problem but to to dissolve it and not

667
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:14,480
to have ever imagined in the first place that there would be a dualism between matter on one hand

668
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:20,800
and mind on the other and so you know whitehead's taking this track uh in an attempt to understand

669
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:26,000
how there could be conscious animals like us in this universe what must the universe be like

670
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:33,280
such that we are possible um is the question that whitehead asks and so he wants to push

671
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:38,720
experience down all the way to the simplest happenings in nature but remember he's a process

672
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:51,440
thinker so it's not that atomic bits of matter are or have experience um we don't want to think of

673
01:18:52,000 --> 01:19:00,000
particles as little substances as as um little inert um you know globules of stuff

674
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:09,440
um remember in whitehead's metaphysics the universe is made not of stuff but of happenings

675
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:18,240
and so um a particle for whitehead let's say a hydrogen atom it's an enduring entity we can

676
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:27,120
actually see groups of atoms now under microscope and for whitehead that enduring entity is itself

677
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:34,480
he would call it a society of happenings it's a or a historical root of happenings that are repeating

678
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:41,680
the same pattern inheriting the same pattern from moment to moment as this helium or this hydrogen

679
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:49,760
atom right and so you could say the experience of the hydrogen atom is this rather repetitive

680
01:19:51,440 --> 01:19:56,720
experience of just saying ah I am I am helium I am helium I am helium just over and over and over

681
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:03,520
again and there is indeed a vibration to these to these particles right and for whitehead the

682
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:14,080
vibratory signature is itself um an expression of this this process of um arising and perishing

683
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:20,400
arising inheriting the past and perishing and so we get the sort of um the vibrate the

684
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:26,240
vibratory pattern of this atom persisting uh through time and so what is experience in this

685
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:35,040
context well at the simplest level it's just the feeling of inheritance of a past and the

686
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:40,160
the contrast of the contrast between that feeling of inheritance and an openness to the future

687
01:20:41,440 --> 01:20:51,120
and so if you can just just imagine the the um various form of like tension that might exist in

688
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:58,080
this present moment that is not closed off from the past and the future but it's held intention

689
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:04,160
between past and future between inheritance and anticipation and you know for these simpler

690
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:10,960
forms of of existence it's just a flash right and that that moment the present moment as you move

691
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:16,880
up the scale of nature and into more complex organisms the present moment can expand a bit

692
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:24,880
we can in our conscious imaginations as human beings we can we can hold the present moment

693
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,280
keep the tension stretched and taught and consider different possibilities before we

694
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:37,920
actualize one of them right for hydrogen atom there's no time for considering possibilities

695
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:44,400
it's just repeat the past repeat the past but always with some little bit of creativity

696
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:49,520
otherwise hydrogen wouldn't have formed stars stars were something new in the universe

697
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:54,880
you know 500 000 years after the big bang or thereabouts

698
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:58,240
hadn't been any stars and then all of a sudden there were stars where did they come from well

699
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:05,120
it's because these simpler forms of energetic activity aren't just repeating the past they're

700
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:12,720
also lured by certain possibilities to take on greater complexity and order and deepen their

701
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:20,480
experience so you know it's it's a difficult imaginative exercise to think of experience in a

702
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:29,680
way that's generic enough and general enough that it's not conscious reflective human experience

703
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:37,840
anymore but something yeah vaguer and just more basic but why did things you know if we give it

704
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:46,160
a try we can't imagine something um simple enough that it could reasonably be applied across every

705
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:55,600
scale of the universe thank you um we've still got a number of questions to get through but i'm just

706
01:22:55,600 --> 01:23:01,680
gonna i'm gonna um because of the time i just want to balance the scales a little bit um and

707
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:07,600
take it in a different direction and bring it back to the human being this is um so i think

708
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,440
you talked about the transformation of the subject into this is it the super jacked

709
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:21,680
great okay um and this is a question from paul and it's rauti and other american pragmatists have

710
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:27,280
suggested that the contemplation of metaphysics has been a philosophical distraction for 2000 years

711
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,080
partly because we can't know what we know rather the goal of philosophy should be making life better

712
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:45,840
for all please discuss yeah so richard rauti called himself a pragmatist and i think you know

713
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,160
he he is a version of pragmatist um you know inheriting the thought of

714
01:23:52,800 --> 01:24:00,080
william james and charles sander's purse and john dewey whitehead is also a pragmatist you know as

715
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:08,160
i mentioned he took up william james's chair of philosophy at harvard um a little more than a decade

716
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:17,680
after james had died and you know for for whitehead william james was he called james the american

717
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:28,000
plato um and thought that james put um philosophy and metaphysics on a new basis and what whitehead

718
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:37,600
found so important about james's philosophy uh was its pragmatic emphasis and so whitehead is

719
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:45,360
a pragmatist he is a radical empiricist in james's sense of the term um and so given that you might

720
01:24:45,360 --> 01:24:52,080
wonder well why was he doing this abstract metaphysical stuff well you could say that

721
01:24:52,080 --> 01:25:00,400
what whitehead did was take james's psychology um and if if you've read james's 1890 book uh

722
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:06,720
principles of psychology maybe you haven't read the whole thing it's it's quite thick but any

723
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:13,680
part of it um you'll see what a brilliant writer james is it's so accessible um and still very

724
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,120
relevant i mean you know neuroscience was just beginning to take baby steps back then but

725
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:24,480
so much of what james had described is is you know with a few tweaks here and there are still

726
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:33,760
accurate and whitehead's taking james's psychology and actually this this phrase um drops of experience

727
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:41,200
whitehead borrows from james's psychology and applies it to cosmology um james had some of

728
01:25:41,200 --> 01:25:47,120
his own speculations and i think we could say he was a panpsychist of sorts but what whitehead

729
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:54,960
does is take james's psychology and systematizes it into a cosmology and so you know whitehead has

730
01:25:54,960 --> 01:26:01,360
to do some system building um he has to develop all of these categories as part of his new

731
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:09,120
cosmological scheme because he wanted to make sense of science um and james might have been

732
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:16,960
somewhat unhappy with the this the systematic element of whitehead's philosophy james was suspicious

733
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:23,040
of system um he worried that it it would it would grow too abstract and disconnected from everyday

734
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:29,120
life and you know perhaps one could criticize whitehead on these grounds but whitehead himself

735
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:36,160
at least his intention uh was to elucidate our everyday experience he even goes so far as to say

736
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:41,040
right at the beginning of process in reality he says the sole justification for any thought

737
01:26:41,680 --> 01:26:47,760
the sole justification for any theory is the elucidation of experience

738
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:54,880
and so what's driving whitehead to erect this whole cosmological scheme is he wants to make sense of

739
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:03,600
the universe that science is describing to us so that it can be understood as congruent with

740
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:11,040
and consistent with our everyday conscious experience and he thought that um already with

741
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:16,080
the first scientific revolution in the mechanistic world view that there was an incoherence because

742
01:27:16,080 --> 01:27:20,480
the human soul was put off to one side the rest of nature was described as a machine

743
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:27,600
and then in the 20th century we couldn't even fit um the disciplines the sub-disciplines of physics

744
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:33,360
together as part of the same universe right because you know I didn't mention relativity theory

745
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:41,840
describes um the macroscopic universe as this you know continuous field whereas quantum theory

746
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:47,600
describes the microscopic universe as discontinuous they don't fit together these two theories they're

747
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,600
describing two very different universes and so that's the first problem whitehead wanted to

748
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:56,480
solve with his cosmology how can these two theories relativity and quantum theory describe the same

749
01:27:56,480 --> 01:28:03,120
universe but also how can our physical understanding of the universe be related to our human conscious

750
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:12,400
experience right and how can we preserve um a sense of importance and purpose and value

751
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:19,120
and freedom and beauty all the things that are part of the human realm of conscious existence

752
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:26,560
right how can we take all of that seriously as real factors in the universe not just as

753
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,120
nice things that humans can believe in despite the fact that physically we know they're not real

754
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,800
for whitehead if if that's the metaphysics or the cosmology that's guiding our civilization

755
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:44,080
we're in deep trouble because that's a very fragmented worldview where we're asking people

756
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:50,160
to find purpose in their lives that they know or they're told to believe is actually

757
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:55,200
ultimately illusory whitehead didn't think that that was a stable foundation upon which to build

758
01:28:55,200 --> 01:29:02,240
a civilization he thought that uh the scientific picture or scientific understanding of the universe

759
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:09,520
must in some way support the values that we presuppose as civilized human beings

760
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,400
and so his pragmatism comes through in his effort to justify

761
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:26,560
human human values in light of our cosmological understanding so how can we fit our scientific

762
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:32,880
understanding into a cosmological picture that would provide a source of inspiration for us

763
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:40,320
in our social and cultural and political endeavors rather than being at best irrelevant or at worst

764
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:50,160
a profound challenge to any sense of purpose that we might attempt to realize so yeah ultimately

765
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:55,120
I think whitehead is a pragmatist we already didn't like whiteheads metaphysics I think we're already

766
01:29:55,120 --> 01:30:05,200
was especially influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein in this view where you know whitehead was engaging in

767
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:13,680
this form of metaphysics that you know is predicated upon the idea that language can

768
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:22,880
provide us some insight into the nature of reality of the world beyond words

769
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,280
and you know there are some readings of Wittgenstein that suggest that that's

770
01:30:28,240 --> 01:30:34,800
just a a faulty understanding of what language is and what the task of the philosopher is which

771
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:40,640
is simply to to clarify our sentences and to make sure we know what can and cannot be said

772
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:47,920
whitehead wasn't satisfied with any sense of boundary um he didn't want to remain silent

773
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:53,840
about the apparently ineffable he wanted to be able to expand the dictionary as he said

774
01:30:54,400 --> 01:31:01,040
and invent new words to describe realities that we hadn't even conceived of yet or hadn't yet perceived

775
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,000
and in this way he's you know he engages philosophy like a poet and that with new

776
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:12,400
turns of phrase we can actually enhance our perception so that the world we thought we knew

777
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:18,560
with the prior language is expanded as we begin to speak about it in a new way.

778
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:30,320
Matt thank you so much I want to thank you on behalf of all the participants for being

779
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:36,720
for being so generous with your insights with your erudition and also for fielding such

780
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:43,200
a broader broad array in the discussion from the questions there and just jumping in.

781
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:50,800
We've got three invitations and one of them is going to come from you because you're doing an

782
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:58,080
online course at Schumacher which is Science and the Soul of the World and that is 24th of July

783
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:04,320
to Saturday 28th of August. Can you say a few words to tempt people in?

784
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:14,560
Yes so um this is my second go at this course it's Science and the Soul of the World um it's

785
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:24,640
not just on whitehead it's also on a German um poet and scientist and statesman Gerritter

786
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:29,280
and what I'm trying to do here in this course is

787
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:38,160
reveal the ways in which Gerritter as a poet scientist and whitehead as a

788
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:44,640
mathematician and philosopher though they may seem like quite different

789
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,200
like they have quite different approaches to to understanding the natural world

790
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:57,360
they are in fact sort of ideal opposites that in brought into polar relationship with one

791
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:03,520
another can intensify our understanding of the universe and indeed a universe that is

792
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:11,600
ensouled a universe that has a soul um and that they these figures both whitehead and Gerritter

793
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:20,240
allow us to engage in science um not as a a method which would disenchant the world but in fact

794
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:26,160
there's another approach to science which they exemplify uh which allows us to um

795
01:33:27,040 --> 01:33:33,600
to study it in a way that enhances its enchantment that in that allows us to deepen into

796
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:40,560
the life of the whole of which we are apart and so um I think we have six sessions together

797
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:45,680
and you know we'll go deeper into whitehead we'll go deeper in Gerritter we'll bring them into

798
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:49,360
dialogue and um I think it's going to be a lot of fun

799
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,640
Matt thank you and I think Troy has put the the link to the Datington website

800
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:02,240
into the chat so you guys can get it there if not if you just go to the Datington website

801
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:10,080
then you can find out all about that okay so two more invitations to join us um the next one

802
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:17,040
is for the Healistic Science Online um lecture series we'll be back on Thursday the 1st of July

803
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:26,560
again at 4 p.m. with Stephen Harding um and Stephen is sorry Stefan is one of the founding

804
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:32,320
members of Schumacher College and he will be presenting on Deep Ecology and the Healing of

805
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:40,080
the Earth and then there's an invitation to join us in person actually live live human beings

806
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:45,760
and that's at Schumacher College later in the year October the 1st of the 3rd that is for the

807
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,040
Healistic Science in Dialogue Conference um that's a collaboration between the Field Centre

808
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:57,920
Schumacher College and the Healistic Science Journal and that conference revisits and builds on

809
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:04,160
the contributions to Healistic Science made by Henry Bortoft, Margaret Colhoon and Brian Goodwin

810
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:12,800
so we'll have presentations, research panels and also discussions booking for for the live

811
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:20,480
for that live conference will happen as of next week so we have confirmed speakers Emma Kidd,
