00:00.000 --> 00:11.400
I'm going to say hello and a warm welcome to the free monthly online holistic science

00:11.400 --> 00:12.400
talks.

00:12.400 --> 00:18.400
Again, they're organised by Schumacher College in collaboration with the Field Centre.

00:18.400 --> 00:25.800
I'm Simon Rieks, having asked you where you're from, I'm in Nalsworth at the Ruskinmore Trust.

00:25.800 --> 00:31.520
I'm the publishing manager for Ruskinmore Trust and a researcher at the Field Centre.

00:31.520 --> 00:37.720
This month we are delighted to be welcoming Matt Sagal, and Matt will be presenting on

00:37.720 --> 00:44.040
Alfred North Whitehead's Philosophy of the Organism, sorry, Philosophy of Organism.

00:44.040 --> 00:50.360
I'm going to give a brief introduction to Matt, who is a process philosopher and he

00:50.360 --> 00:55.880
teaches on process relational thought and German idealism for the Philosophy, Cosmology

00:55.880 --> 01:02.800
and Consciousness programme at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.480
Matt's going to present on Whitehead, who's best known for his process philosophy, as

01:07.480 --> 01:13.120
a broad number of applications, and you can find this, for example, in ecology, theology,

01:13.120 --> 01:19.160
education, physics, economics and other such areas.

01:19.160 --> 01:24.880
So before I hand over to Matt, there is a Q&A box that you'll find on the bottom of

01:24.880 --> 01:31.960
your screen, and then if you put your questions or your comments, I will then shape those

01:31.960 --> 01:41.280
into a discussion with Matt for you at the end of his presentation.

01:41.280 --> 01:47.160
Please try not to put them in the chat box, try and put them in the Q&A.

01:47.160 --> 01:56.080
Okay, Matt, a very, very warm welcome to you, we're delighted to have you with us.

01:56.080 --> 01:57.280
Thanks so much, Simon.

01:57.280 --> 02:07.160
Great to be here on planet Earth somewhere, you all are, and I'm here in California.

02:07.160 --> 02:15.360
It's a delight to be able to join Schumacher College, to meet Simon this morning, to see

02:15.360 --> 02:22.280
Troy and Judith here, and I've been really enjoying the opportunity to teach a bit for

02:22.280 --> 02:23.280
Schumacher.

02:23.280 --> 02:30.840
I've talked twice now in the past, once in person at Dardington Hall, back in 2018, of

02:30.840 --> 02:38.800
course on Whitehead, and then earlier this year online in Pandemic Mode, of course on

02:38.800 --> 02:42.920
Whitehead and Gerta, and I'm doing that again later this summer.

02:42.920 --> 02:50.120
And it's a real delight, both to work with master students at Schumacher College and

02:50.120 --> 02:52.800
also short course participants.

02:52.800 --> 03:00.480
I've found in teaching Whitehead that there's such a diversity of people with a diversity

03:00.480 --> 03:02.400
of backgrounds that are interested in his work.

03:02.400 --> 03:08.000
As Simon was mentioning, he's sort of touched on a whole variety of different disciplines.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.560
He's not just a philosopher, or at least his philosophy is not just relevant to other

03:14.560 --> 03:22.840
philosophers, it's also meant to be an aid to our everyday lives and part of an effort

03:22.840 --> 03:29.560
to allow us to reconnect to a universe that, you know, in the last few hundred years has

03:29.560 --> 03:38.160
really grown in size, in magnitude, compared to what pre-modern people were used to.

03:38.160 --> 03:44.200
And so we're in quite a novel situation, and Whitehead's philosophy of organism is

03:44.200 --> 03:48.200
an attempt to make us or allow us to feel more at home here.

03:48.200 --> 03:56.880
So I'm going to try to go into, go until the top of the hour here and run through first

03:56.880 --> 04:05.600
a brief sort of biographical introduction to Whitehead, who he was, the trajectory of

04:05.600 --> 04:06.840
his career.

04:06.840 --> 04:13.000
I think that helps make sense, it helps us make sense of how it is he managed to touch

04:13.000 --> 04:19.280
on so many aspects of, you know, contemporary human life here on planet Earth.

04:19.280 --> 04:24.160
And then I want to just step back and ask the question, you know, why would we even care?

04:24.160 --> 04:25.160
Why do we do philosophy?

04:25.160 --> 04:26.160
Why do we do metaphysics?

04:26.160 --> 04:31.880
Why is it relevant to our lives?

04:31.880 --> 04:37.960
And then I want to spend the remaining time going into detail, introducing you to some

04:37.960 --> 04:46.840
of Whitehead's philosophical concepts and to try to paint the picture of a world in

04:46.840 --> 04:47.840
process.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.040
He's a process philosopher, right?

04:50.040 --> 04:57.600
And so I'll introduce you to some of his categories, his concepts, his new words, neologisms.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.800
And after that, you'll probably be full of questions.

05:02.800 --> 05:19.320
So all right, let me share my screen here and thumbs up, Troy or Simon, if that's good.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.160
Okay, great.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.600
So there he is.

05:24.600 --> 05:32.200
Whitehead was born in Ramsgate, England in 1861.

05:32.200 --> 05:37.600
And by the time he, in his late teens, you know, he's already showing a lot of promise

05:37.600 --> 05:49.880
in mathematics and he makes his way to Cambridge University, King's College, and Trinity, excuse

05:49.880 --> 05:53.960
me, not King's College, and studies math there.

05:53.960 --> 05:59.520
He studies with James Clerk Maxwell's student.

05:59.520 --> 06:06.920
So Maxwell, of course, invented the or discovered the electromagnetic theory and developed the

06:06.920 --> 06:11.000
maths to understand the propagation of light waves.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.960
And Whitehead wrote his dissertation on the electromagnetic theory.

06:16.960 --> 06:24.320
And so from, you know, his very first academic work and research, he is bridging mathematics

06:24.320 --> 06:34.360
and physics and this connection between the abstract domain of geometry and the concrete

06:34.360 --> 06:41.160
physical world remains of deep interest to him throughout his career, as we'll see.

06:41.160 --> 06:50.880
So in, I think, 1884 or so, 1885, he begins teaching mathematics at Cambridge.

06:50.880 --> 06:57.800
Around 1906, he and Bertrand Russell begin to collaborate.

06:57.800 --> 07:04.520
Actually Russell starts as Whitehead's student, and they, you know, very quickly realized

07:04.520 --> 07:09.960
that, you know, they were peers, to some extent, and that they should be working together

07:09.960 --> 07:19.640
on a project that climaxed in the Principia Mathematica, which was a supposed to be four

07:19.640 --> 07:26.880
volumes and ended up being three volumes, which was an attempt to prove logically that

07:26.880 --> 07:30.080
one plus one, in fact, equals two.

07:30.080 --> 07:37.040
And we might take for granted that this is a simple formula that even, you know, elementary

07:37.040 --> 07:40.000
school children can can solve.

07:40.000 --> 07:46.720
But in fact, as they discovered in the course of writing this book together, there are some

07:46.720 --> 07:51.240
logical paradoxes embedded in this simple formula.

07:51.240 --> 07:58.480
We don't really have a clear definition of what a number is, much less what two numbers

07:58.480 --> 07:59.720
are.

07:59.720 --> 08:05.000
And so Russell and Whitehead did really, you could say, inaugurate the whole discipline

08:05.000 --> 08:14.320
of analytic philosophy by developing a quite impenetrable symbolic language that costs quite

08:14.320 --> 08:16.000
a bit of money for Cambridge to print.

08:16.000 --> 08:20.120
I think they even asked to just to do this, the type setting.

08:20.120 --> 08:25.600
I think they even asked Russell and Whitehead to chip in a little bit of their own funds

08:25.600 --> 08:30.240
to print the first 500 copies.

08:30.240 --> 08:35.160
The book didn't sell very well, but it was nonetheless very influential.

08:35.160 --> 08:42.160
So that was, I think, 1911 through 1914, that these three volumes came out.

08:42.160 --> 08:48.120
There were supposed to be a fourth volume on geometry, which was going to be mostly

08:48.120 --> 08:49.600
Whitehead's contribution.

08:49.600 --> 08:57.200
But the war started and Whitehead and Russell began to have some tension around that.

08:57.200 --> 09:04.320
Russell, of course, would be himself dismissed from Trinity College, Cambridge for his pacifism

09:04.320 --> 09:06.520
and anti-war activism.

09:06.520 --> 09:12.640
Whitehead, I don't know that he was cheering on the war, but his son, Eric, was drafted

09:12.640 --> 09:18.960
and was in the Royal Air Force, and a few years later actually would be shot down over

09:18.960 --> 09:21.360
France, I believe, and died.

09:21.360 --> 09:33.760
And so given that just the difficulty around the loss, not just for Whitehead personally,

09:33.760 --> 09:40.120
but for many of the European nations during the war and Russell's, you know, you could

09:40.120 --> 09:43.840
say brave pacifist stance at that point.

09:43.840 --> 09:49.000
Whitehead and Russell, who were good friends, sort of had a bit of a falling out.

09:49.000 --> 10:00.840
And at that point, there was something else brewing in the international scene of physics

10:00.840 --> 10:03.240
and cosmology.

10:03.240 --> 10:08.800
Albert Einstein, of course, beginning in 1905 and then in 1916, had published his special

10:08.800 --> 10:11.800
and general theories of relativity.

10:11.800 --> 10:18.680
And Whitehead, independently of Einstein, had already been exploring, again, this relationship

10:18.680 --> 10:21.800
between math and the physical world.

10:21.800 --> 10:29.560
Actually also in 1905, Whitehead had published this article that was called Mathematical Conceptions

10:29.560 --> 10:31.880
of the Material World.

10:31.880 --> 10:38.440
And in there, he's exploring different approaches to modeling the physical world mathematically

10:38.440 --> 10:47.360
and he looks at four or five different models and the fourth and fifth models begin to gesture

10:47.360 --> 10:53.040
towards something like a relativistic understanding of bringing space and time into a more intimate

10:53.040 --> 10:57.040
relationship than had either or two been done.

10:57.040 --> 11:06.800
But Einstein was the real genius here in bringing together some work that had already been underway

11:06.800 --> 11:15.960
with physicists like Lorenz and Minkowski and Reiman and others, building on the development

11:15.960 --> 11:20.920
of non-Euclidean geometry to totally shift and transform our understanding of space and

11:20.920 --> 11:23.960
time and gravity and matter and energy.

11:23.960 --> 11:32.520
And so Whitehead was really swept up by this Einsteinian revolution in physics in the first

11:32.520 --> 11:35.440
two decades of the 20th century.

11:35.440 --> 11:42.080
It brought him more and more out of just mathematics and physics and into metaphysics.

11:42.080 --> 11:54.280
So to set the scene here, in 1916, Einstein had made some predictions about how light

11:54.280 --> 11:58.840
would bend around the sun and suggested that during an eclipse, we would be able to take

11:58.840 --> 12:05.280
photographs of the moon blocking the light of the sun and see the stars around the sun

12:05.920 --> 12:12.320
and we could actually measure the parallax, the degree to which the light from the stars

12:12.320 --> 12:19.400
around the sun shifted due to the warping effect of the sun's gravitation.

12:19.400 --> 12:24.400
Newton had also made a prediction that this would occur, but Einstein's prediction was

12:24.400 --> 12:27.800
about, I think, twice as much as Newton's.

12:27.800 --> 12:32.280
And so they could determine whether Einstein's theory of gravity was correct or not by observing

12:32.280 --> 12:34.480
an eclipse.

12:34.480 --> 12:40.000
Actually Einstein's first prediction was off.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.000
He got the math wrong.

12:42.000 --> 12:53.640
And lucky for him, the attempt to prove his theory in 1916, it must have been, was thwarted

12:53.640 --> 12:59.560
because, well actually it was 1914, so he had developed a theory a little bit earlier.

12:59.560 --> 13:06.000
And someone went off to Russia to try to observe an eclipse that was happening then,

13:06.000 --> 13:11.320
but the war started and this scientist was arrested and his equipment was impounded and

13:11.320 --> 13:12.520
he couldn't run the test.

13:12.520 --> 13:17.160
If he had, he would have found that Einstein's prediction was off.

13:17.160 --> 13:22.120
So luckily that didn't occur or Einstein might have been dismissed and wouldn't be the greatest

13:22.120 --> 13:24.680
genius of the 20th century.

13:24.680 --> 13:30.520
Einstein has another chance to redo his math, makes a new prediction.

13:30.520 --> 13:37.960
Sir Arthur Eddington and a team of astronomers from the Royal Society decide in 1919 that

13:37.960 --> 13:44.920
they're going to travel to the West Coast of Africa and to Brazil to have two teams to

13:44.920 --> 13:47.560
observe the eclipse in 1919.

13:47.560 --> 13:52.480
They're able to take some photographic plates.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.480
They barely got enough plates.

13:54.480 --> 14:02.240
It was hot and the mirrors were warping and Eddington was off the coast of Africa on this

14:02.240 --> 14:09.440
island where monkeys were stealing his equipment and so it was not easy to get these photographic

14:09.440 --> 14:16.760
plates of the eclipse, but they managed it and Eddington makes the announcement later

14:16.760 --> 14:22.480
that year in London at the Royal Society, Whitehead is in the audience.

14:22.720 --> 14:30.160
Eddington says, we have confirmed Einstein's predictions, light indeed is warped by the

14:30.160 --> 14:38.960
presence of mass because according to Einstein, space bends, space time is warped, it bends.

14:40.320 --> 14:47.520
That's what many of the newspaper headlines read the next day, there were headlines like

14:47.520 --> 14:55.600
space caught bending and Whitehead reports the theatrical environment in the hall at the Royal

14:55.600 --> 15:06.160
Society when these men and women of science are taking in this new discovery, the universe has

15:06.160 --> 15:12.480
unveiled another aspect of itself, but Whitehead has some issues with this notion of space bending

15:12.480 --> 15:20.000
and over the next several years you would have several occasions to speak with Einstein

15:21.760 --> 15:28.160
at the statesman and philosopher Lord Haldane's home in London.

15:28.160 --> 15:32.000
There was a party that Haldane through invited Einstein.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.480
Einstein gave a couple lectures as well at Cambridge and elsewhere and Whitehead tried to

15:38.480 --> 15:42.880
talk Einstein out of his implicit metaphysics.

15:42.880 --> 15:50.320
He was fine with the physics and with the new geometrical tools that Einstein had developed

15:50.320 --> 15:55.760
with help from other mathematicians, but he was worried about this notion of space bending

15:56.480 --> 16:02.640
because the thing about measurement is that you need a rigid ruler in order for measurement to

16:02.640 --> 16:10.880
be accurate and Whitehead thought that if space was allowed to bend due to the presence of mass

16:10.880 --> 16:16.400
which is sort of contingently spread around the universe we're in a situation where before we

16:16.400 --> 16:21.440
can measure anything accurately we first have to know where all the mass is, but to know where

16:21.440 --> 16:28.480
all the mass is we'd first have to measure it and so you can see how as Whitehead put it we'd

16:28.480 --> 16:35.040
first have to know everything before we can know anything and you know Einstein had a response to

16:35.040 --> 16:40.400
this that because over the the spread of the entire universe masses distributed more or less

16:41.520 --> 16:45.920
evenly we don't have to worry about the warping of space over long distances,

16:46.560 --> 16:53.920
Whitehead was not convinced, he thought that we needed to distinguish between space which was a

16:53.920 --> 16:59.920
matter for geometers, geometry to figure out and physics, you know the mass which was what we're

16:59.920 --> 17:05.680
trying to measure and if we conflate the two we end up with some logical and indeed metaphysical

17:05.680 --> 17:14.080
paradoxes and so this set Whitehead off into metaphysics himself and he developed a whole

17:14.080 --> 17:20.160
philosophy of nature and a cosmology which integrated relativity theory and also the

17:20.720 --> 17:27.600
early some early aspects of quantum theory that were being developed in the 1920s and just as

17:27.600 --> 17:36.000
Whitehead was beginning this work he was invited to when he was 64 I believe he was invited to come

17:36.000 --> 17:43.920
to the United States to the other Cambridge, Cambridge, Massachusetts where he began lecturing

17:43.920 --> 17:50.480
in the philosophy department for Harvard University. Whitehead says in his first course

17:51.760 --> 17:58.000
as a professor at Harvard that it was also it has to count as his first philosophy course

17:58.000 --> 18:02.560
himself, he'd never actually taken a philosophy course and here he was taking up the chair that

18:02.560 --> 18:11.440
William James, a great American philosopher had held until like 1910 and Whitehead continues at

18:11.440 --> 18:19.680
Harvard from 1924 until 1937 when he retires and during this time he publishes a number of books

18:20.400 --> 18:27.840
on process philosophy or his so-called philosophy of organism. Process in reality

18:28.640 --> 18:35.280
was published in 1929, it was actually a series of lectures he gave at the University of Edinburgh

18:35.280 --> 18:43.680
so he went back across the pond to Scotland and gave the Gifford lectures and process in

18:43.680 --> 18:50.080
reality is one of the most difficult books in the history of western philosophy. I don't recommend

18:50.080 --> 18:56.320
that you try to read it by yourself, you may get lost and will never be seen or heard from again

18:56.320 --> 19:05.760
in the thicket of new words and difficult arguments that Whitehead makes in that text, however

19:07.360 --> 19:13.360
if you can find a group of other people who are weird enough to be interested in metaphysics,

19:14.080 --> 19:20.480
studying it together is helpful, you can keep track of each other, you can speak with each other in

19:20.480 --> 19:26.960
this new language that Whitehead develops and I don't mean to scare you off from studying Whitehead's

19:26.960 --> 19:35.520
work, I just think it's important to recognize that he's really developing a new language in this

19:35.520 --> 19:42.880
book and his subsequent texts which are a little bit easier to read, adventures of ideas, modes of

19:42.880 --> 19:53.680
thought, some titles of his later books which take the dense technical and formal language of

19:53.680 --> 19:58.880
process and reality and make it a little bit more digestible, but Whitehead's really trying to

19:58.880 --> 20:06.400
develop a new language that once we learn it, it in fact alters our perception I would say

20:06.400 --> 20:15.520
and we begin to inhabit a world that is no longer sort of the mechanistic common sense that

20:15.520 --> 20:22.480
for the last few hundred years we've been raised to accept where we're in a sort of spatial container

20:22.480 --> 20:32.480
with other solid objects in this container and that time is simply a measure of the change of

20:32.560 --> 20:37.600
the location of these objects in this spatial container and that these objects including

20:37.600 --> 20:45.280
we ourselves, we have no intrinsic relationship to each other, we're all what Whitehead would say,

20:45.280 --> 20:51.040
we're all just externally related in this container of space bumping into each other,

20:51.040 --> 20:57.760
that's the sort of more or less Newtonian picture that Whitehead thinks 20th century physics

20:57.760 --> 21:07.120
completely demolishes and so let's shift them to this question of why philosophy is is even

21:07.120 --> 21:15.280
important and you know why Whitehead was drawn into metaphysics, you know I spoke to this a bit,

21:15.280 --> 21:22.960
it was he was really inspired by the Einsteinian and quantum revolutions in physics to move in

21:22.960 --> 21:28.720
the philosophy but why, well because he felt that these revolutions in physics had demolished the

21:28.720 --> 21:36.160
old mechanistic worldview, the old mechanistic metaphysics that had undergirded science since

21:36.160 --> 21:43.680
its foundation in the 17th century, Whitehead refers to this as scientific materialism and it

21:43.680 --> 21:52.160
was based on the idea, two main ideas which he refers to as the idea of simple location,

21:52.800 --> 21:58.880
that a thing has simple location in space and that its location can be determined independently

21:58.880 --> 22:04.160
of the location of everything else in space and the other idea would be this notion of

22:05.120 --> 22:11.200
nature being fully present at an instant or say a bit of matter being fully present

22:11.200 --> 22:18.880
at an instant so that there's sort of this notion of of matter as just this enduring lump of stuff

22:18.880 --> 22:25.760
or substance would be the technical metaphysical term that just mutely endures indoors in its

22:25.760 --> 22:31.200
motions through space or its endurance through time, it's just there right fully present at an

22:31.200 --> 22:37.200
instant and with simple location. Now after relativity and quantum theories

22:38.160 --> 22:44.240
demolished both of these notions of simple location and nature at an instant,

22:45.120 --> 22:52.080
Whitehead realized that science was now advancing its theoretical understanding

22:53.360 --> 23:01.280
almost floating in free air, floating without a metaphysical foundation and if you try to

23:01.360 --> 23:06.480
understand quantum theory and all the the weirdness that ends up seeming

23:08.000 --> 23:12.320
like a consequence of some of the findings of quantum theory you'll note that there's such a

23:13.600 --> 23:19.680
disconnect between our common sense experience and what quantum theory is telling us like

23:19.680 --> 23:27.520
Schrodinger's cat right in this chamber with a radioactive isotope apparently we can't know

23:27.520 --> 23:32.080
whether the cat is dead or alive but it's worse than that we have to say that the cat is both dead

23:32.080 --> 23:37.120
and alive at the same moment right this totally conflicts with our common sense understanding

23:37.120 --> 23:42.000
and from Whitehead's point of view this is because we don't have we don't have the metaphysical

23:42.000 --> 23:48.240
substructure to undergird our scientific understanding such that what we discover

23:49.280 --> 23:54.960
in the special sciences whether it's in physics and the different aspects of physics or in biology

23:55.920 --> 24:03.200
or in chemistry unless all of these special sciences have a metaphysical substructure

24:03.200 --> 24:07.120
we don't know first of all how they all relate to each other just within science

24:07.120 --> 24:12.800
but we also don't know how science itself relates to our everyday experience to our common sense

24:12.800 --> 24:20.800
experience of being conscious agents in a world of other conscious agents who we think have some

24:20.880 --> 24:29.120
responsibility for their actions who perceive beauty who you know have have purposes and

24:29.120 --> 24:36.560
life goals how do we integrate the findings of contemporary science with the hardcore

24:36.560 --> 24:44.160
presuppositions of our everyday lives Whitehead thought that the 20th century revolutions in

24:44.240 --> 24:51.600
physics and even before that the metaphysics of scientific materialism and mechanism had

24:51.600 --> 24:58.560
sort of left us in a bit of a muddle in a fragmented state because I mean before the

24:58.560 --> 25:04.640
revolutions of the 20th century if you looked at mechanistic science and tried to integrate that

25:04.640 --> 25:10.160
even though mechanistic science was Whitehead admitted a clear set it had a clear set of

25:10.160 --> 25:18.240
principles everything was more or less understood the universe was a clockwork right that doesn't

25:18.240 --> 25:24.400
integrate with our understanding of human life at all this is why you know Descartes an early

25:24.400 --> 25:30.080
modern scientist had his dualism where the mechanistic world could be understood with

25:30.080 --> 25:36.400
perfect precision mathematically but it was set apart from the inner realm of the human soul

25:37.360 --> 25:43.840
right and this was a sort of a compromised position but as science advanced it began

25:43.840 --> 25:50.480
to encroach more and more upon the inner life of the human soul but then in the early 20th century

25:50.480 --> 25:55.840
as as this mechanistic metaphysics is called into question Whitehead seized the opportunity

25:56.480 --> 26:02.000
to develop a more coherent understanding that was not dualistic that didn't separate

26:02.720 --> 26:09.520
human consciousness from the rest of nature but that understood nature not as a collection of

26:09.520 --> 26:17.760
objects blindly colliding with one another in empty space but rather came to understand nature

26:17.760 --> 26:29.280
as a network of events you might say and this network of events is for Whitehead in in a process

26:29.280 --> 26:38.960
of becoming that is inherently tilted towards complexity tilted toward beauty he would say

26:39.840 --> 26:45.280
and when we think of nature as a a network of events

26:47.920 --> 26:56.720
Whitehead thought that an event or an occasion a happening something like you know the the

26:56.720 --> 27:05.600
agitation of energy described in electromagnetic theory that this was easier to bridge you know

27:05.600 --> 27:11.680
the agitations of energy as a as a as a happening as an event is easier to bridge with our understanding

27:11.680 --> 27:20.160
of experience because experience too is a happening it's not just an object in space right it is a

27:20.160 --> 27:26.320
subject to which events are transpiring or for which events are transpiring and so in Whitehead's

27:26.320 --> 27:34.880
universe subjectivity is understood to be pervasive not conscious self-reflective

27:37.360 --> 27:42.880
you know rational consciousness such as human beings some of the time possess

27:43.600 --> 27:52.720
um but a more basic form of experience which is uh simply the the feeling of inheriting a past and

27:52.720 --> 27:58.960
anticipating a future right so every event in the universe for Whitehead is inheriting a past

27:58.960 --> 28:04.800
and anticipating a future even if you think of the wavelength of light you know it's even if it's

28:04.800 --> 28:09.920
highly repetitive in its inheritance of the past just repeating the same energetic pattern over

28:09.920 --> 28:14.160
and over again Whitehead says well why is it repeating that pattern because it's enjoyable

28:14.880 --> 28:23.120
right and so this is a point where many people who are perhaps more wed to the materialist worldview

28:23.120 --> 28:27.680
and want to see human consciousness is something totally different Whitehead's going to give them

28:27.680 --> 28:35.760
pause here and they're going to find this perhaps incredulous incredible but Whitehead found reasons

28:35.760 --> 28:44.960
looking at and we'll go into this looking at the post Einsteinian post quantum study of physics

28:46.000 --> 28:53.360
and looking at biology and evolutionary theory he found that he was justified in moving to

28:53.360 --> 29:00.240
what's called a panpsychist or a pan experiential metaphysics because again his goal was not only

29:00.240 --> 29:07.680
to integrate all of the sciences but to understand how science and human life can be integrated such

29:07.680 --> 29:13.360
that the universe that we actually experience as conscious human beings would have some relationship

29:13.360 --> 29:20.880
to the you know the the particles and the waves and and the galaxies and stars distant stars studied

29:20.880 --> 29:28.560
by by science and so we do philosophy and metaphysics Whitehead would say

29:30.480 --> 29:38.960
in an effort to to understand our place in the universe right and one of the best images

29:40.080 --> 29:46.960
that I could find for describing Whitehead's universe was was this spider web with some

29:47.040 --> 29:55.440
dew drops on it so rather than again a universe imagined as a spatial container with objects

29:55.440 --> 30:03.280
within it I described Whitehead's universe as a network of events and Whitehead refers to events

30:03.280 --> 30:11.680
also as actual occasions and these are actual occasions of experience right and each of these

30:11.680 --> 30:18.080
dew drops you can imagine as an actual occasion of experience and that they exist in this network

30:18.080 --> 30:25.280
or mesh work with one another is to say that just as each of these dew drops reflects all the other

30:25.280 --> 30:33.600
dew drops each actual occasion is mirroring the rest of the universe and so there's a holographic

30:33.600 --> 30:41.920
sense in which within each actual occasion at whatever location it happens to be in the universe

30:41.920 --> 30:51.200
it is in fact containing within itself the entirety of its cosmic environment right and so if you

30:51.200 --> 30:57.760
were to zoom in on any of these dew drops you'd see each of the other do do drops reflected there

30:57.760 --> 31:04.640
and then if you were to zoom in on those dew drops you'd see again the repetition in a fractal

31:04.640 --> 31:10.240
like way of the entire web and so there's this infinite nesting occurring in each of these

31:10.240 --> 31:19.040
actual occasions of experience and in Whitehead's universe we're not just externally related to one

31:19.040 --> 31:29.200
another from moment to moment we are including one another one another's pasts within ourselves

31:29.200 --> 31:34.320
right and so the only problem with this web is that it it presents a sort of static picture

31:34.320 --> 31:40.720
of interconnection Whitehead's understanding of the relationship among these actual occasions

31:40.720 --> 31:51.280
of experience is in process right and so we'd have to imagine a more dynamic image whereby

31:51.280 --> 31:59.120
these dew drops are constantly growing together into one another and then dispersing out again

32:00.960 --> 32:07.840
if we think about this in human terms it's a profoundly Whitehead's is a profoundly relational

32:07.920 --> 32:16.800
understanding of existence whereby you know as you're taking in my image and my words right now

32:17.760 --> 32:27.040
yes it has to be translated into you know electronic pulses in a in a series of

32:27.840 --> 32:32.320
transistors and and microchips and then sent across the planets wherever you are but then

32:32.320 --> 32:40.560
it's produced through your speakers on your computer back into sound and my image is conveyed to you

32:40.560 --> 32:47.840
and Whitehead is saying that the energy that I am expressing is absorbed by you and it actually

32:47.840 --> 32:55.360
becomes part of you and when I get to hear your questions later you will become part of me and

32:55.440 --> 33:04.480
that we're in this constant give and take with one another whereby we are literally making each

33:04.480 --> 33:13.920
other from moment to moment and so it's quite a profound mesh work that challenges not only this

33:13.920 --> 33:20.240
old idea of mechanistic physics that things exist independently of other things but it challenges

33:20.240 --> 33:29.200
our modern sort of political and social sense of individuality at least if we take that to an

33:29.200 --> 33:36.000
extreme if we were to imagine individuals existing on their own private island without

33:37.040 --> 33:42.560
being constituted by their relations to others I mean it becomes quite obvious when we think about

33:42.640 --> 33:50.640
developmental psychology and the maturation of of an infant in relationship to the mother

33:52.320 --> 34:00.240
we can see I think in that dynamic the sense in which we really do belong to one another we really

34:00.240 --> 34:07.360
do require our relationships with one another to be who we are as individuals and that's very

34:07.360 --> 34:27.120
much in the spirit of Whitehead's philosophy so before even the 20th century revolutions in

34:27.120 --> 34:33.040
science there was the first scientific revolution which was shocking enough right it begins with

34:33.040 --> 34:42.080
Copernicus who rediscovered some ancient Pythagorean speculations about the design of the solar system

34:43.360 --> 34:49.680
and you know Copernicus puts forward this hypothesis that actually it's not the earth

34:49.680 --> 34:55.520
that's at the center it's the sun that's at the center and the earth like the other planets

34:55.520 --> 35:02.000
is wandering in space so you know Copernicus throws the earth into motion this was profoundly

35:02.000 --> 35:12.960
unsettling for you know the the medieval world to to take in and in many ways hundreds of years

35:12.960 --> 35:20.000
later we're we're still grappling with the fact that we live on a planet that is in motion through

35:20.000 --> 35:29.360
space and following Copernicus Kepler and Galileo and Newton developed laws of physics that allowed

35:30.320 --> 35:36.560
allowed them to overcome this ancient sense of a division between the earthly and the heavenly

35:36.560 --> 35:42.240
realms right the terrestrial and the celestial domains for Aristotle very different laws applied

35:42.240 --> 35:49.760
in these two domains there was perfect motion above the sphere of the moon perfect circular motion

35:49.760 --> 35:55.920
but below the sphere of the moon from the terrestrial sphere there was only imperfect

35:55.920 --> 36:02.160
motion but Newton with his universal law of gravitation says note the same laws apply

36:04.320 --> 36:09.760
in heaven as as as apply on earth and so modern science

36:11.920 --> 36:20.160
inaugurates this new sense of the unity of the universe in fact and one way of looking at this

36:20.240 --> 36:27.680
is to say that now post scientific revolution the earth is itself brought into heaven

36:28.720 --> 36:32.640
I mean the materialistic way of saying it would be that the heavens were brought down to earth

36:32.640 --> 36:39.200
but I think we can look at it either way and so you know from a contemporary cosmological point

36:39.200 --> 36:48.400
of view Whitehead felt the urgency of providing us with a newfound sense of of where we are

36:49.200 --> 36:57.840
right situating us in these vast expanses of space and time but just to think about our situation

36:57.840 --> 37:07.200
in space this is a map as it were of our local galactic neighborhood with the Milky Way at the

37:07.200 --> 37:13.280
center Andromeda off to the right and down a bit Andromeda is actually hurtling towards us

37:14.000 --> 37:19.520
and we will collide with Andromeda at some point in the next I think

37:21.040 --> 37:28.800
billion or two years it it might not be as catastrophic a collision as as you might

37:28.800 --> 37:34.880
first assume two galaxies colliding there's a lot of space within each galaxy and while

37:34.880 --> 37:39.840
the gravitational effects might distort the perfect spirals of these two galaxies

37:40.560 --> 37:48.560
it's likely that we will survive or the earth will survive and that in fact this

37:49.120 --> 37:55.760
the gravitational effects of this collision will seed new stars right so this whole understanding

37:55.760 --> 38:01.440
of of our situation as a galaxy among other galaxies billions hundreds of billions of other

38:01.440 --> 38:08.000
galaxies in our visible universe it's you know we're talking about a century here where this

38:08.000 --> 38:16.240
has been understood and it's profoundly disorienting right there's been plenty of documentaries that

38:17.440 --> 38:23.360
you know Carl Sagan maybe the first to do it and more recently people like Neil deGrasse Tyson

38:23.360 --> 38:34.400
and others who just depict this this new story of of where we are and it's almost maybe we think

38:34.400 --> 38:40.800
it's normal now we know the words you know to use to describe our situation but have we really taken

38:40.800 --> 38:50.320
it in the magnitudes here are I think actually impossible for us to grasp we don't have the

38:52.000 --> 38:58.000
the biological capacity given the proportion that our senses have evolved you know to allow us to

38:58.000 --> 39:03.440
perceive I don't even I don't really think we have the imagination that is powerful enough

39:03.440 --> 39:07.920
to really make sense of our scientific knowledge and for whitehead this was a problem

39:09.360 --> 39:16.640
because if we don't have uh if we if we're not adequate if our imagination is not adequate to

39:16.640 --> 39:24.560
our knowledge uh he he was worried that the very foundations of civilization would be unstable

39:25.440 --> 39:32.560
because a civilization needs to have some sense of confidence in its purpose and to know our purpose

39:32.560 --> 39:38.880
we have to know our place in the wider universe and so whitehead was very worried right about as

39:38.880 --> 39:43.760
much as he was excited by the advances in science he was worried that there wasn't enough effort

39:43.760 --> 39:53.040
being made to connect his uh this new cosmological story to our everyday human existence and this

39:53.040 --> 40:00.240
is an attempt to depict our situation in time if that galactic map was our situation in space this

40:00.240 --> 40:07.680
is a simulation of what happened hundreds of millions of years after the big bang as the first

40:07.680 --> 40:14.400
clouds of gas condensed and gravitational forces brought them together to form stars

40:15.120 --> 40:17.120
which form the first spiral galaxies

40:23.920 --> 40:28.240
and so from whitehead's point of view right remember as I was describing this in the

40:28.960 --> 40:38.080
with the spider web and the dew drops all of that space all of that time despite the the vast

40:38.080 --> 40:45.120
magnitudes we're talking you know roughly 14 billion years back to the origin of of the visible

40:45.120 --> 40:52.320
universe according to you know inflationary cosmology or big bang cosmology and the you know

40:52.320 --> 40:58.080
hundreds of millions billions hundreds of billions of galaxies that we can observe

40:59.360 --> 41:07.840
whitehead thinks that all of this is unfolded within each moment of our experience that it took

41:09.200 --> 41:16.400
the entire history of the universe to produce each one of us right and you know we know we're

41:16.400 --> 41:25.840
all stardust right and that even it took a second generation star to produce heavy elements through

41:25.840 --> 41:33.840
the process of you know going supernova so that complex chemistry and the emergence of life

41:33.840 --> 41:40.720
would be possible here on planet earth and perhaps on other planets and so whitehead really wants us

41:40.720 --> 41:49.440
to feel the the energies and the magnitudes of this wider cosmic environment as as something

41:49.440 --> 41:58.000
that is present within us as a potential and that is in fact giving us the strength and the power

41:59.440 --> 42:05.120
to to move forward in the world as human beings in a creative way we are an expression of all of

42:05.120 --> 42:14.160
that cosmic organization but how do we bring it down to earth how do we inhabit this planet

42:15.520 --> 42:23.200
how do we make sense of of our situation here you know with grass and trees and clouds and the sky

42:27.520 --> 42:33.280
let's hear from whitehead for the first time he says philosophy has to rescue the facts

42:33.920 --> 42:41.760
as they are from the facts as they appear we view the sky at noon on a fine day it is blue

42:42.640 --> 42:49.760
flooded by the light of the sun the direct fact of observation is the sun as the sole origin of

42:49.760 --> 42:52.080
light and the bare heavens

42:58.720 --> 43:00.480
conceive the myth of adam and eve

43:03.040 --> 43:05.680
in the garden on the first day of human life

43:06.880 --> 43:14.560
they watch the sunset the stars appear and low creation widens to man's view

43:14.560 --> 43:20.320
the excess of light discloses facts and also conceals them

43:22.720 --> 43:26.000
right and so whitehead is here pointing out the way that

43:28.720 --> 43:35.680
there's more to the universe than what at first meets the eye which is why the scientific

43:36.320 --> 43:43.440
process of discovery is so exciting and so with lauren we think we have understood something and

43:43.520 --> 43:47.360
we continue to study it and then there's a deeper layer which reveals itself

43:49.920 --> 43:52.960
from whitehead's point of view this process of discovery is unending

43:53.600 --> 44:00.080
because the universe isn't just a finished object it's not a the big bang is not something

44:00.080 --> 44:08.000
which occurred 14 billion years ago and then finished right it's still banging the universe

44:08.000 --> 44:16.400
is still in the process of creating itself and we as scientific observers are a part of that

44:16.400 --> 44:22.000
creative process and so in a universe of creative process we will never be done

44:23.520 --> 44:28.320
knowing right knowing itself must remain an open-ended process

44:30.080 --> 44:36.480
and whitehead wants to invite us into a new understanding of knowledge right and

44:37.200 --> 44:44.160
this is where his understanding of science and philosophy relates to

44:45.280 --> 44:52.880
education he was an educational reformer who while he was always teaching mathematics and

44:52.880 --> 44:59.200
philosophy he was also involved in administration trying to shape the modern research university

44:59.200 --> 45:05.840
to provide a holistic education for for its students so that students who majored in science

45:05.840 --> 45:11.600
would also also take courses in literature and humanities and vice versa he thought that if

45:11.600 --> 45:18.000
someone were to graduate from university only having studied engineering without any sense of

45:19.360 --> 45:28.000
you know Shakespeare or without any exposure to to to Kant and the history of philosophy that

45:28.000 --> 45:36.960
it really diminishes our outlook on the nature of reality and so for whitehead knowledge is really

45:38.720 --> 45:43.920
important but it's a side issue the important thing is learning right and the process of learning

45:45.680 --> 45:51.600
we do learn in order to come to possess knowledge but in whitehead's view we have to be willing

45:52.560 --> 45:57.600
to not be possessive over our knowledge because it's going to constantly need to be updated

45:57.600 --> 46:04.000
and expanded and so you know we could think of his view of of of science and the scientific

46:04.000 --> 46:08.880
investigation into nature is not an effort to produce knowledge as though the universe were

46:08.880 --> 46:14.560
just some fixed already completed collection of objects out there but science is really about

46:14.560 --> 46:24.560
this ongoing process of learning and that in in many ways it is an end in itself right it's not

46:24.560 --> 46:30.080
that we investigate as a means to arrive at some end where we will then possess the complete

46:30.960 --> 46:39.120
and and final understanding of everything science is the process of learning the process of

46:39.120 --> 46:48.320
discovery is itself the end right and we need to whitehead would say be content to remain in wonder

46:48.880 --> 46:54.240
at this universe and ourselves are placed within this universe to pursue science

46:55.360 --> 46:59.120
as an infinite task right rather than something that could finally be completed

47:00.320 --> 47:06.560
you know whitehead says i often start my talks on whitehead with this quote but i'll give it to

47:06.560 --> 47:16.160
you now that echoing Aristotle he says philosophy begins in wonder but whitehead adds at the end

47:16.160 --> 47:22.480
when philosophic thought has done its best the wonder remains right and so the goal of the

47:22.480 --> 47:31.360
philosopher is not to replace wonder with explanation to explain away wonder right by reference to

47:31.360 --> 47:39.520
whatever mechanism might be favored in a particular era rather the goal of the philosopher and the

47:39.520 --> 47:51.200
scientist is to elucidate and and bring some understanding to our experience of wonder but

47:51.200 --> 47:58.160
that experience will always remain it cannot be explained away right and if science begins to

47:58.160 --> 48:04.960
explain away the wonder for whitehead that's a pretty good indication that it has become dogmatic

48:05.920 --> 48:12.400
and needs to be it needs the critic the critique of a philosopher to remind

48:13.920 --> 48:17.920
to remind it that in fact we inhabit a creative universe

48:21.440 --> 48:28.000
it's one more powerful line from whitehead and then we'll get into some of the details of his

48:28.000 --> 48:36.080
metaphysics you know what i only have like five minutes left so we'll have to i'll give you the

48:36.800 --> 48:44.240
quicker version of whiteheads entire metaphysical scheme so whitehead says in our experience there

48:44.240 --> 48:52.880
is always the dim background from which we derive and to which we return we are not enjoying a limited

48:52.880 --> 49:00.880
doll's house of clear and distinct things secluded from all ambiguity in the darkness beyond

49:02.160 --> 49:09.360
there ever looms the vague mass which is the universe begetting us right and so for whitehead

49:09.360 --> 49:16.960
this vague mass is what he calls creativity right it is this ultimate metaphysical category for him

49:17.840 --> 49:23.360
and everything that we see around us everything that we experience in ourselves is an expression

49:23.360 --> 49:32.080
of this creativity it's this creativity taking the form of temporary products right so creativity

49:32.080 --> 49:42.480
is infinite productivity and then our bodies planets stars these are temporary sort of

49:43.360 --> 49:52.080
achievements of creativity which enjoy themselves as they arise but then perish back into this

49:52.800 --> 50:00.240
creative process but they perish back into the creative process gifting their experience back

50:00.240 --> 50:06.640
to the whole such that the process of the universe is unfolding for whitehead is i would call it

50:06.640 --> 50:11.600
cumulative right there's a memory bank and everything that happens in the universe gets added

50:11.600 --> 50:18.800
to that memory bank so that the next moment to arise has this storehouse of experience to

50:18.800 --> 50:30.480
draw upon to advance the universe one step further right so this is going to be quick

50:31.120 --> 50:38.320
and do not expect to have by the end of this five minutes mastered whitehead's technical jargon here

50:38.320 --> 50:42.960
but i want to use this illustration to introduce you to some of his concepts here this is

50:43.760 --> 50:48.560
these are some daffodils and i'm going to explain the process of concrescence to you

50:49.120 --> 50:55.680
concrescence is whitehead's term for how creativity or infinite productivity becomes

50:56.240 --> 51:02.960
a finite product concrescence is that process whereby the infinite becomes finite but only

51:02.960 --> 51:08.960
for a moment because the finite entity which has concrest immediately perishes back into

51:10.400 --> 51:13.600
this you know dim background from out of which we arise and perish

51:15.760 --> 51:20.400
so if we turn these daffodils on their side we can use them to illustrate illustrate

51:20.400 --> 51:26.640
concrescence which whitehead defines as in terms of this i think almost magical formula

51:27.520 --> 51:33.360
um concrescence is the process whereby the many become one and are increased by one

51:34.800 --> 51:42.560
what does that mean well the many are perished objects in the past environment so the daffodils

51:42.560 --> 51:49.040
here are let's say an actual occasion of experience right and each actual occasion of experience

51:49.600 --> 51:54.720
begins by inheriting perished objects in its past environment

51:56.720 --> 52:03.200
now in addition to the past environment whitehead also had this realm of what he called eternal

52:03.200 --> 52:10.720
objects these are like platonic forms but unlike Plato's forms whitehead didn't privilege this realm

52:10.720 --> 52:17.840
of eternal objects as the preeminent actualities right for Plato the forms were the most real

52:17.840 --> 52:23.600
things that there were and the actual world was a pale imitation whitehead totally inverts that

52:23.600 --> 52:29.760
picture these eternal objects for whitehead become deficient in actuality he says they're

52:29.760 --> 52:38.320
pure potentials but they long for actualization and they're pure potentials so that they provide

52:39.280 --> 52:45.680
the different forms of definiteness that become actual in an actual occasion of experience so

52:46.240 --> 52:52.640
colors shapes sounds they're they're sort of like the adjectives that characterize our experience

52:55.120 --> 53:00.320
so every actual occasion has these two poles to it a physical pole

53:02.080 --> 53:11.040
and a mental pole right and so everything down to um subatomic particles and the most

53:11.120 --> 53:17.920
trivial puff of existence and far off empty space up to um each moment of our conscious human

53:17.920 --> 53:23.040
experience is an actual occasion which has a physical pole and a mental pole though for

53:23.040 --> 53:31.200
very simple occasions like those associated you know with photons or protons or subatomic particles

53:32.240 --> 53:37.040
these occasions are mostly dominated by their physical pole right which is to say that

53:37.040 --> 53:46.000
they're repeating what has occurred in their past without much innovation now an occasion inherits

53:46.000 --> 53:53.840
its past via what whitehead calls a prehension and a prehension is a feeling right prehensions are

53:53.840 --> 54:02.080
the process whereby the past is allowed the objectified past right the perished past is allowed

54:02.080 --> 54:08.560
entry again into the into the present to be felt by this concussing occasion of experience

54:11.440 --> 54:16.960
now eternal objects are not you could say they're prehended they're conceptual prehensions but

54:16.960 --> 54:24.240
whitehead also has a term for this called ingression so these pure potentials ingress into the mental

54:24.240 --> 54:31.040
pole of an occasion to allow this occasion to again characterize what is it what it has inherited

54:31.040 --> 54:35.920
from its past environment now without the ingression of eternal objects to provide

54:36.480 --> 54:44.480
an actual occasion uh with some novelty some alternative ways of characterizing what it

54:44.480 --> 54:49.600
is inheriting from its past then there would only be repetition right in each of these

54:49.600 --> 54:57.760
occasions of experience and so the ingression of eternal objects provides some source of novelty

54:57.760 --> 55:03.520
in the mental pole of an occasion so that it can innovate upon what it is inheriting from

55:03.520 --> 55:10.720
its past but again simpler forms of experience say in the inorganic world they don't ingress much

55:10.720 --> 55:20.640
novelty they mostly repeat the past right it's only more complex living organisms and multicellular

55:20.640 --> 55:29.600
animals like like you know mammals and primates and humans who can ingress um these pure potentials

55:29.600 --> 55:36.960
so as to you know really radically shift um from from what we inherit from the past and

55:36.960 --> 55:43.600
do something totally new almost free we might say um freedom something like freedom seems to become

55:43.600 --> 55:50.800
possible uh in in human beings we don't just have to repeat the past anymore but again the

55:50.800 --> 55:58.400
inorganic world does mostly repeat the prehensions of its past which is why um physics can develop

55:58.400 --> 56:05.360
such reliable um lawful descriptions of what happens in the inorganic world whereas it's very

56:05.360 --> 56:12.000
difficult to um predicts how a human being will behave in a new situation but even us we still

56:12.000 --> 56:18.800
have some degree of habituality right in our behavior but nonetheless we ingress we ingress

56:18.800 --> 56:27.440
these pure potentials and are capable of quite a bit of novelty now this term subjective form is

56:27.440 --> 56:33.840
whitehead's way of talking about the emotional quality that of occasion experiences as it begins

56:33.840 --> 56:38.960
to inherit its past how does it feel about that past right that's the subjective form

56:39.920 --> 56:48.560
and then the subjective aim is how in the process of uh concresing the various prehensions of the

56:48.560 --> 56:56.000
past are led to grow together and and any conflict between them between the feelings of the past

56:56.000 --> 57:02.640
is brought into contrast whitehead says and harmonized like notes in a chord that is struck

57:03.600 --> 57:08.560
and so the subjective aim allows the the many of the past to grow together into a new one

57:09.920 --> 57:17.840
right and achieve satisfaction as this new subject which for whitehead as soon as that

57:17.840 --> 57:24.720
new subjective point of view is achieved it perishes right and becomes a superject

57:24.880 --> 57:38.160
and this superject uh is a subject's way of um of persisting into the future of gifting itself

57:38.160 --> 57:44.720
and the value that it has realized in its process of concrescence to the future so that it becoming

57:44.720 --> 57:49.760
a part of the universe again can be taken up by the next moment of concrescence right so

57:50.000 --> 57:55.200
the last thing I want to say about this is if we think about it um at the level of our own

57:55.200 --> 58:00.080
psychology as human beings this this process of concrescence is meant to apply at multiple levels

58:00.080 --> 58:06.960
right it's the it applies at the simplest level of of a wavelength of light and electromagnetic

58:06.960 --> 58:16.160
propagation uh as it does to our stream of consciousness you know for for we psychologically

58:16.240 --> 58:26.000
psychologically um complex human beings and what it what whitehead is suggesting in in our case is

58:26.000 --> 58:32.080
the reverse of of the Cartesian understanding where Descartes said I think therefore I am right

58:32.080 --> 58:41.920
which implies that there's an already existing subject me who has experiences right and or has

58:41.920 --> 58:50.160
thoughts and these thoughts sort of um they qualify um my substantial self but my substantial

58:50.160 --> 58:55.280
self the subject that I am pre-exists my experiences of objects in the environment

58:55.920 --> 59:01.520
and um sort of persists as the same entity throughout my life whitehead is saying

59:03.360 --> 59:09.920
that actually in each moment of my experience a new subject is emerging and rather than a

59:09.920 --> 59:16.400
pre-existing subject having experience of objects in whitehead's universe the perished objects of

59:16.400 --> 59:26.400
the past are growing together and being concrest into a new subject so a new subject grows out of

59:26.400 --> 59:33.440
the perished objects of the past allowing the past which is finished and perished right to

59:33.440 --> 59:39.280
to move again into the future um through the present and so each present moment of our subjective

59:39.280 --> 59:47.520
experience is the result of the growing together of these objects and so whitehead says he says no

59:47.520 --> 59:53.440
thinker thinks twice right and if if you're familiar with the first process philosopher

59:53.440 --> 59:59.760
Heraclitus he says uh you can't step into the same river twice well whitehead is extending this

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:06.080
principle of process philosophy into our own conscious experience no thinker thinks twice

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:14.240
or we could say no subject experiences twice right because each moment the subject of perspective

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:21.600
that we are is arising out of our environment experiencing and itself as a new perspective

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:27.280
enjoying that perspective and then that perspective perishes and becomes an object for the next

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:35.040
moment to inherit and so in whitehead's view my identity my personality my sense of a flow of

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:42.480
consciousness is actually a whole series of these actual occasions a historical root he says of

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:48.320
these occasions which are in the case of my own consciousness intimately related to one another

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:56.000
in a way that you know my historical root is not as intimately woven together as

01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:03.760
with your historical root and so we each have our own sort of flow of consciousness because we each

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:10.560
are composed of a of a distinct chain of actual occasions which are inheriting from one another

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:19.040
and so a human soul in whitehead's view becomes something that needs to be understood as a sort

01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:26.560
of pulsing process of coming right rather than a substantial ego as it was as it was in Descartes

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:33.840
view we're more of a process right and we are a process that is constantly enfolding the environment

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.880
into us right and so we're not separate from the environment we are the environment

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:48.960
coming to take a subjective perspective upon itself it's a radically different view of who

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:59.200
and what we are from the typical Cartesian perspective so I will I will stop with that

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:09.200
I'm sure you are I'm sure your heads are spinning that's a good thing this is a very novel perspective

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:15.120
on reality and so if you're not confused then you probably didn't hear me but I'm happy to

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:21.280
discuss this with you and answer some of your questions so thanks for your attention

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.880
I'll stop sharing my screen here too there we go

01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:34.800
so Matt I want to thank you very much for the first of all for the invitation into the confusion

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:41.920
but also for the clarity that you brought I really appreciate your introducing of white heads

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:46.480
biography and then deepening into the philosophy I get a sense of somebody who

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:52.560
wants to develop a language to enable a new seeing of the world but one that is corroborated by

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:59.120
science at the same time and it also gives the human being this this creative knowing

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.560
it has creative knowing and the process of becoming back to the human being

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.920
yes good so

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.240
the next session we're going to come we're going to give over to a discussion

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.920
and I've got some questions that have come in from the participants

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:29.040
and this is Jason and he's saying concerning whitehead and Einstein developing mathematical

01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:35.680
physics this is to say that math wasn't really meaningfully applied to physics

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:41.040
or to the study of the material world before this point what does it mean more broadly to

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:49.360
have begun to conceive the world abstractly at this time yeah very good question

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:55.920
um no it's not to say that math isn't meaningfully applied to physics

01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.520
there would be no modern physics if we couldn't meaningfully apply math

01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:12.160
and you know whitehead was in in being critical of Einstein wasn't trying to say

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:22.080
that we cannot use mathematics to model the physical world he was simply

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:29.360
trying to suggest that we must be careful not to mistake the model the mathematical model

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:37.360
for the reality and so in the case of Einstein whitehead did not deny the practical utility

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:47.200
of a four-dimensional geometric manifold for making predictions about how bodies masses

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:54.080
move in space. Einstein's equations are very accurate in the predictions that they make

01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:03.360
about large masses in space and in fact in space time even his his understanding of the

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:10.480
relativity of space and time has been tested by synchronizing clocks very accurate clocks putting

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:15.760
one of them in an airplane flying around for a while and coming back to look at the to compare

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:22.560
the two clocks the clock that moves in the airplane is slower relative to the clock that

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:29.840
remained on earth we've tested this so the the faster that an object moves apparently the slower

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:41.280
that time passes for it relative to a stationary observer so the consequences of some of Einstein's

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:49.600
equations while they may be difficult for us to grasp and imagine are nonetheless many of them

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:59.040
experimentally proven now but the question still remains given the physical accuracy of

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:05.920
Einstein's mathematical models what's going on metaphysically what is the relationship between

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:14.720
the model and the reality now one of the issues that whitehead has with Einstein is in he would

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:20.880
describe it in terms of what he called the fallacy of misplaced concreteness many people who have

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:28.880
not read whitehead directly have probably seen him cited in other works with with regard to this

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:33.280
fallacy of misplaced concreteness and this is just precisely to mistake the model for the reality

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:40.880
if Einstein's model of spacetime is correct in other words not just correct but if it is in fact

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.960
if there is no difference between the model and the reality then that says something about our

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:53.280
our human conscious experience of a flow of time it says that it's an illusion basically

01:06:53.840 --> 01:07:01.040
and Einstein repeated this notion you know he famously wrote in a in a letter to one of his

01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:10.320
best friends widows that upon the death of his best friend that you know for us believing physicists

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.120
the difference between the past the present and the future is nothing but a stubbornly persistent

01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:23.600
illusion now for whitehead this is no basis for a purposeful human life to take that point of

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:30.320
view seriously and so whitehead like some other 20th century philosophers disagreed with Einstein

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:38.160
not about the accuracy of of his new model for making predictions but about the metaphysical

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:48.720
interpretation that Einstein was giving it Birxon Henri Birxon the the French philosopher had a

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:55.840
debate with Einstein in 1922 about the nature of time and and Birxon wanted to say hey we can only

01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:04.800
do science because we are conscious beings and all the dials and meters and and doing the math it

01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.880
all presupposes conscious human beings right um a clock can't get itself read without a conscious

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:19.200
human being to to look at it and for Birxon as for whitehead there's a a time a process of unfolding

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:27.600
that is um anterior to or prior to the time that is measured on clocks by physicists

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.840
and Einstein did not like this idea he didn't want to cede any territory to the metaphysicians

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:41.120
claiming this um concrete time of becoming as somehow primary but if we don't recognize this

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:47.520
time as primary as concrete then we lose ourselves in the abstractions of the model and we we begin

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:53.920
to denigrate the deliverances of our concrete experience by reference to the model which we

01:08:53.920 --> 01:09:01.200
are told is what's real and so whitehead is just saying to Einstein and he's not saying we can't

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:07.040
use the tools of math to understand the physical world he's saying do not forget that we're dealing

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:13.920
with models and that um there's more to the concrete becoming of the universe than any model can capture

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.960
so hopefully that helps with that question. Matt thank you that also there was also another

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:30.000
question on Birxon but we've touched on Birxon a little bit um I want to go from the west to the

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.080
east we've got two questions around and this is normally this is quite a popular question

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:41.440
around western philosophers this um this this genre of question so and this comes from Jurgen

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.240
and also from Dennis what would you say about the connection between whitehead and eastern thought

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.960
say Taoism to me it seems almost as if whitehead is dressing Taoism in western language there's

01:09:52.960 --> 01:10:01.360
a friendly smiley face after that one I should explain um and then also yeah does whiteheads

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:07.520
philosophy relate to the I'm sorry how does whiteheads philosophy relate to the Hindu-Vedic

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:13.440
cosmological concept of Indra's net or web if that is something you are familiar with.

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:21.520
Yeah um great questions Indra's net is precisely what I was attempting to illustrate

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:29.600
with my spider web with dew drops on it that is certainly an apt metaphor for whitehead's

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:36.960
cosmology with the caveat that we have to throw it into motion and make it more dynamic.

01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:45.040
Whitehead's universe is not simply not that it's simple it's not simply though a holographic

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:52.160
universe wherein each part reflects the whole um it's also a creative advance whereby again

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.680
remember the definition of concrescence the many become one and are increased by one so the universe

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:06.960
is this um cumulative process that is continually growing the universe is never the same twice

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:13.600
and so when we think about the universe as a whole as all of these occasions of experience

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:21.600
reflecting or mirroring or containing one another there's also new occasions of experience

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.800
constantly being birthed which contain the entire past but carry it forward into the next moment

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.840
so it's much like Indra's net though with this dynamic tilt toward toward the future toward

01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:40.480
toward the as yet unrealized future and you know in terms of the broader connections to

01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.400
eastern thought uh eastern religion and philosophy whitehead says himself in

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:57.600
process and reality that his metaphysics resembles more um Vedic and and Buddhist forms

01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:04.480
of thought than it does um anything in western philosophy uh or in the Judeo-Christian religious

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:14.800
traditions um and so he was quite aware of this he didn't study Taoism or Buddhism in any depth

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:22.080
so far as I know um he did write a book called religion in the making which was published shortly

01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:30.080
after process in reality where it's clear he had done some reading in Buddhism he was impressed

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:37.680
enough by the Buddhist tradition to say that it qualifies as what he called one of the rational

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:50.560
religions and he certainly his his notion of of flux and impermanence right has quite a a

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:55.680
similarity to the the Buddhist notion of you know impermanence or emptiness

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:03.440
um the relationship of these dew drops on the web is also something you can describe as a relationship

01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:11.440
of dependent co-origination uh which is an important concept uh for certain um Mahayana

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:20.080
Buddhist traditions and in the contemporary worlds um actually whitehead's work is being taken up

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:30.800
um by China uh there are something like 35 graduate programs in China devoted to process

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:37.520
philosophy and and whitehead's thought um two billion people 35 graduate programs so it's you

01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:44.000
know a lot of people but still that's a lot of whitehead in China and I think there are several

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.480
reasons that the Chinese are so interested in whitehead's thought one is that yeah it fits naturally

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:55.280
with um the the Taoist and Confucian Buddhist traditions there but

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:01.680
my understanding is that uh you know the communist party is a little bit hesitant to

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:07.760
allow in those more ancient traditions and to they want to be modern and whitehead affords them

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:13.600
the opportunity to to be modern with his understanding of science and you know he's coming from the west

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:21.200
um but while still tapping into these these deeper um traditional understandings of

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:28.000
of the the nature of the universe as as Lao Tzu and Shuang Tzu and Confucius um

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:33.360
not that Taoism and Confucianism are the same but there are some similarities there

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:42.000
whitehead's thought allows uh China to in a way get in touch with its own history while also

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:48.400
moving more into the modern world and so his thought is exploding there I think precisely

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:52.880
because of the resonances that that are being remarked upon in these in these questions

01:14:55.440 --> 01:15:01.120
Matt thank you uh I want to go in a different direction now and this is what to do with with

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:07.520
panpsychism and possibly consciousness studies and this is from Dennis who's saying Matt in your view

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:14.640
what does it mean to experience and the sub question from that is can particles experience

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:23.920
yeah good question this is a major stumbling block uh for many people who are new to whitehead's

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:29.840
thought though um what's sometimes called panpsychism is actually undergoing a bit of a renaissance

01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:37.920
right now um even in analytic philosophy more philosophers of mind are taking this

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:46.000
idea seriously um even in the last five or ten years than ever before um whitehead's not the

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:55.360
first panpsychist obviously um Leibniz uh was a was a panpsychist um Giordano Bruno one of the

01:15:55.360 --> 01:16:01.520
early modern scientists was a panpsychist um and so there's a there's a sort of venerable tradition

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:08.560
here it's a sort of um marginalized yes but still um readily uh visible stream in the history of

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:15.360
western thought even Heraclitus processed philosophy yes right um everything is flux

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:21.920
but Heraclitus also referred to everything as he says the universe is an ever-living fire

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:28.880
and so in other words life goes all the way down right life isn't something that just emerges

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:37.440
atop a physical substrate um and so for whitehead he protested against what he called the notion of

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:45.920
vacuous actuality a vacuous actuality would be um some sort of an entity which is imagined to exist

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:51.840
independently of experience whether its own experience or being experienced by someone else

01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:59.120
he thinks it's a meaningless notion and the reason panpsychism is becoming

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:09.920
is coming more into the mainstream academic uh philosophical uh arena is because of the

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.200
difficulty of this hard problem of consciousness right which is if we do inhabit a physical world

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:24.640
that is not experiential at what point does something like conscious experience

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:34.400
arise or emerge um and and how does it emerge right if if in the physical world you have parts

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:41.440
that just rearrange their relative location to one another um and just mutely persist right as

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:49.600
these substantial bits um how is it that surely through a rearrangement of those inert parts

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:55.440
you could ever get something like an interior experience right or or uh experience of what

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:03.440
it's like to be somebody um it seems like not only a hard problem but an impossible problem

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:09.440
and so panpsychism is an attempt not so much to solve the problem but to to dissolve it and not

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.480
to have ever imagined in the first place that there would be a dualism between matter on one hand

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:20.800
and mind on the other and so you know whitehead's taking this track uh in an attempt to understand

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.000
how there could be conscious animals like us in this universe what must the universe be like

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:33.280
such that we are possible um is the question that whitehead asks and so he wants to push

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.720
experience down all the way to the simplest happenings in nature but remember he's a process

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:51.440
thinker so it's not that atomic bits of matter are or have experience um we don't want to think of

01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:00.000
particles as little substances as as um little inert um you know globules of stuff

01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:09.440
um remember in whitehead's metaphysics the universe is made not of stuff but of happenings

01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:18.240
and so um a particle for whitehead let's say a hydrogen atom it's an enduring entity we can

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:27.120
actually see groups of atoms now under microscope and for whitehead that enduring entity is itself

01:19:27.120 --> 01:19:34.480
he would call it a society of happenings it's a or a historical root of happenings that are repeating

01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:41.680
the same pattern inheriting the same pattern from moment to moment as this helium or this hydrogen

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:49.760
atom right and so you could say the experience of the hydrogen atom is this rather repetitive

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.720
experience of just saying ah I am I am helium I am helium I am helium just over and over and over

01:19:56.720 --> 01:20:03.520
again and there is indeed a vibration to these to these particles right and for whitehead the

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:14.080
vibratory signature is itself um an expression of this this process of um arising and perishing

01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:20.400
arising inheriting the past and perishing and so we get the sort of um the vibrate the

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:26.240
vibratory pattern of this atom persisting uh through time and so what is experience in this

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:35.040
context well at the simplest level it's just the feeling of inheritance of a past and the

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:40.160
the contrast of the contrast between that feeling of inheritance and an openness to the future

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:51.120
and so if you can just just imagine the the um various form of like tension that might exist in

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:58.080
this present moment that is not closed off from the past and the future but it's held intention

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:04.160
between past and future between inheritance and anticipation and you know for these simpler

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:10.960
forms of of existence it's just a flash right and that that moment the present moment as you move

01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:16.880
up the scale of nature and into more complex organisms the present moment can expand a bit

01:21:17.520 --> 01:21:24.880
we can in our conscious imaginations as human beings we can we can hold the present moment

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.280
keep the tension stretched and taught and consider different possibilities before we

01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:37.920
actualize one of them right for hydrogen atom there's no time for considering possibilities

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:44.400
it's just repeat the past repeat the past but always with some little bit of creativity

01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.520
otherwise hydrogen wouldn't have formed stars stars were something new in the universe

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.880
you know 500 000 years after the big bang or thereabouts

01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.240
hadn't been any stars and then all of a sudden there were stars where did they come from well

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:05.120
it's because these simpler forms of energetic activity aren't just repeating the past they're

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:12.720
also lured by certain possibilities to take on greater complexity and order and deepen their

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:20.480
experience so you know it's it's a difficult imaginative exercise to think of experience in a

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:29.680
way that's generic enough and general enough that it's not conscious reflective human experience

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:37.840
anymore but something yeah vaguer and just more basic but why did things you know if we give it

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:46.160
a try we can't imagine something um simple enough that it could reasonably be applied across every

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:55.600
scale of the universe thank you um we've still got a number of questions to get through but i'm just

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:01.680
gonna i'm gonna um because of the time i just want to balance the scales a little bit um and

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:07.600
take it in a different direction and bring it back to the human being this is um so i think

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.440
you talked about the transformation of the subject into this is it the super jacked

01:23:13.360 --> 01:23:21.680
great okay um and this is a question from paul and it's rauti and other american pragmatists have

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:27.280
suggested that the contemplation of metaphysics has been a philosophical distraction for 2000 years

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:34.080
partly because we can't know what we know rather the goal of philosophy should be making life better

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:45.840
for all please discuss yeah so richard rauti called himself a pragmatist and i think you know

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:52.160
he he is a version of pragmatist um you know inheriting the thought of

01:23:52.800 --> 01:24:00.080
william james and charles sander's purse and john dewey whitehead is also a pragmatist you know as

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:08.160
i mentioned he took up william james's chair of philosophy at harvard um a little more than a decade

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:17.680
after james had died and you know for for whitehead william james was he called james the american

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:28.000
plato um and thought that james put um philosophy and metaphysics on a new basis and what whitehead

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:37.600
found so important about james's philosophy uh was its pragmatic emphasis and so whitehead is

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:45.360
a pragmatist he is a radical empiricist in james's sense of the term um and so given that you might

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:52.080
wonder well why was he doing this abstract metaphysical stuff well you could say that

01:24:52.080 --> 01:25:00.400
what whitehead did was take james's psychology um and if if you've read james's 1890 book uh

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:06.720
principles of psychology maybe you haven't read the whole thing it's it's quite thick but any

01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:13.680
part of it um you'll see what a brilliant writer james is it's so accessible um and still very

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:19.120
relevant i mean you know neuroscience was just beginning to take baby steps back then but

01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:24.480
so much of what james had described is is you know with a few tweaks here and there are still

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:33.760
accurate and whitehead's taking james's psychology and actually this this phrase um drops of experience

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:41.200
whitehead borrows from james's psychology and applies it to cosmology um james had some of

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:47.120
his own speculations and i think we could say he was a panpsychist of sorts but what whitehead

01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:54.960
does is take james's psychology and systematizes it into a cosmology and so you know whitehead has

01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:01.360
to do some system building um he has to develop all of these categories as part of his new

01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:09.120
cosmological scheme because he wanted to make sense of science um and james might have been

01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:16.960
somewhat unhappy with the this the systematic element of whitehead's philosophy james was suspicious

01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:23.040
of system um he worried that it it would it would grow too abstract and disconnected from everyday

01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:29.120
life and you know perhaps one could criticize whitehead on these grounds but whitehead himself

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:36.160
at least his intention uh was to elucidate our everyday experience he even goes so far as to say

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:41.040
right at the beginning of process in reality he says the sole justification for any thought

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:47.760
the sole justification for any theory is the elucidation of experience

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.880
and so what's driving whitehead to erect this whole cosmological scheme is he wants to make sense of

01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:03.600
the universe that science is describing to us so that it can be understood as congruent with

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:11.040
and consistent with our everyday conscious experience and he thought that um already with

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.080
the first scientific revolution in the mechanistic world view that there was an incoherence because

01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:20.480
the human soul was put off to one side the rest of nature was described as a machine

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:27.600
and then in the 20th century we couldn't even fit um the disciplines the sub-disciplines of physics

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:33.360
together as part of the same universe right because you know I didn't mention relativity theory

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:41.840
describes um the macroscopic universe as this you know continuous field whereas quantum theory

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:47.600
describes the microscopic universe as discontinuous they don't fit together these two theories they're

01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.600
describing two very different universes and so that's the first problem whitehead wanted to

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.480
solve with his cosmology how can these two theories relativity and quantum theory describe the same

01:27:56.480 --> 01:28:03.120
universe but also how can our physical understanding of the universe be related to our human conscious

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:12.400
experience right and how can we preserve um a sense of importance and purpose and value

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:19.120
and freedom and beauty all the things that are part of the human realm of conscious existence

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:26.560
right how can we take all of that seriously as real factors in the universe not just as

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:31.120
nice things that humans can believe in despite the fact that physically we know they're not real

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:36.800
for whitehead if if that's the metaphysics or the cosmology that's guiding our civilization

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:44.080
we're in deep trouble because that's a very fragmented worldview where we're asking people

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:50.160
to find purpose in their lives that they know or they're told to believe is actually

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:55.200
ultimately illusory whitehead didn't think that that was a stable foundation upon which to build

01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:02.240
a civilization he thought that uh the scientific picture or scientific understanding of the universe

01:29:02.240 --> 01:29:09.520
must in some way support the values that we presuppose as civilized human beings

01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:14.400
and so his pragmatism comes through in his effort to justify

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:26.560
human human values in light of our cosmological understanding so how can we fit our scientific

01:29:26.560 --> 01:29:32.880
understanding into a cosmological picture that would provide a source of inspiration for us

01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:40.320
in our social and cultural and political endeavors rather than being at best irrelevant or at worst

01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:50.160
a profound challenge to any sense of purpose that we might attempt to realize so yeah ultimately

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:55.120
I think whitehead is a pragmatist we already didn't like whiteheads metaphysics I think we're already

01:29:55.120 --> 01:30:05.200
was especially influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein in this view where you know whitehead was engaging in

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:13.680
this form of metaphysics that you know is predicated upon the idea that language can

01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:22.880
provide us some insight into the nature of reality of the world beyond words

01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:27.280
and you know there are some readings of Wittgenstein that suggest that that's

01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:34.800
just a a faulty understanding of what language is and what the task of the philosopher is which

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:40.640
is simply to to clarify our sentences and to make sure we know what can and cannot be said

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:47.920
whitehead wasn't satisfied with any sense of boundary um he didn't want to remain silent

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:53.840
about the apparently ineffable he wanted to be able to expand the dictionary as he said

01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:01.040
and invent new words to describe realities that we hadn't even conceived of yet or hadn't yet perceived

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:06.000
and in this way he's you know he engages philosophy like a poet and that with new

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:12.400
turns of phrase we can actually enhance our perception so that the world we thought we knew

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:18.560
with the prior language is expanded as we begin to speak about it in a new way.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:30.320
Matt thank you so much I want to thank you on behalf of all the participants for being

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:36.720
for being so generous with your insights with your erudition and also for fielding such

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:43.200
a broader broad array in the discussion from the questions there and just jumping in.

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:50.800
We've got three invitations and one of them is going to come from you because you're doing an

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:58.080
online course at Schumacher which is Science and the Soul of the World and that is 24th of July

01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:04.320
to Saturday 28th of August. Can you say a few words to tempt people in?

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:14.560
Yes so um this is my second go at this course it's Science and the Soul of the World um it's

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:24.640
not just on whitehead it's also on a German um poet and scientist and statesman Gerritter

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:29.280
and what I'm trying to do here in this course is

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:38.160
reveal the ways in which Gerritter as a poet scientist and whitehead as a

01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:44.640
mathematician and philosopher though they may seem like quite different

01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:51.200
like they have quite different approaches to to understanding the natural world

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:57.360
they are in fact sort of ideal opposites that in brought into polar relationship with one

01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.520
another can intensify our understanding of the universe and indeed a universe that is

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:11.600
ensouled a universe that has a soul um and that they these figures both whitehead and Gerritter

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:20.240
allow us to engage in science um not as a a method which would disenchant the world but in fact

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:26.160
there's another approach to science which they exemplify uh which allows us to um

01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:33.600
to study it in a way that enhances its enchantment that in that allows us to deepen into

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:40.560
the life of the whole of which we are apart and so um I think we have six sessions together

01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.680
and you know we'll go deeper into whitehead we'll go deeper in Gerritter we'll bring them into

01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:49.360
dialogue and um I think it's going to be a lot of fun

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.640
Matt thank you and I think Troy has put the the link to the Datington website

01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:02.240
into the chat so you guys can get it there if not if you just go to the Datington website

01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:10.080
then you can find out all about that okay so two more invitations to join us um the next one

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:17.040
is for the Healistic Science Online um lecture series we'll be back on Thursday the 1st of July

01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:26.560
again at 4 p.m. with Stephen Harding um and Stephen is sorry Stefan is one of the founding

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:32.320
members of Schumacher College and he will be presenting on Deep Ecology and the Healing of

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:40.080
the Earth and then there's an invitation to join us in person actually live live human beings

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.760
and that's at Schumacher College later in the year October the 1st of the 3rd that is for the

01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:51.040
Healistic Science in Dialogue Conference um that's a collaboration between the Field Centre

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:57.920
Schumacher College and the Healistic Science Journal and that conference revisits and builds on

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:04.160
the contributions to Healistic Science made by Henry Bortoft, Margaret Colhoon and Brian Goodwin

01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:12.800
so we'll have presentations, research panels and also discussions booking for for the live

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:20.480
for that live conference will happen as of next week so we have confirmed speakers Emma Kidd,

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:27.360
Dr Judith Sassoon, Claudio Stern and also a confirmed keynote is Isis Brook

01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:36.320
so um once again thank you very very much to Max Segal um I'm going to say thank you and

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:41.200
depending on where you are where you've been tuning in from around the world all of you lovely

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:46.320
participants on behalf of the team I'd like to wish you a very good day evening or night

01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:58.160
wherever you may be and hope to see you soon thanks Simon thanks everyone
