0	11400	I'm going to say hello and a warm welcome to the free monthly online holistic science
11400	12400	talks.
12400	18400	Again, they're organised by Schumacher College in collaboration with the Field Centre.
18400	25800	I'm Simon Rieks, having asked you where you're from, I'm in Nalsworth at the Ruskinmore Trust.
25800	31520	I'm the publishing manager for Ruskinmore Trust and a researcher at the Field Centre.
31520	37720	This month we are delighted to be welcoming Matt Sagal, and Matt will be presenting on
37720	44040	Alfred North Whitehead's Philosophy of the Organism, sorry, Philosophy of Organism.
44040	50360	I'm going to give a brief introduction to Matt, who is a process philosopher and he
50360	55880	teaches on process relational thought and German idealism for the Philosophy, Cosmology
55880	62800	and Consciousness programme at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco.
62800	67480	Matt's going to present on Whitehead, who's best known for his process philosophy, as
67480	73120	a broad number of applications, and you can find this, for example, in ecology, theology,
73120	79160	education, physics, economics and other such areas.
79160	84880	So before I hand over to Matt, there is a Q&A box that you'll find on the bottom of
84880	91960	your screen, and then if you put your questions or your comments, I will then shape those
91960	101280	into a discussion with Matt for you at the end of his presentation.
101280	107160	Please try not to put them in the chat box, try and put them in the Q&A.
107160	116080	Okay, Matt, a very, very warm welcome to you, we're delighted to have you with us.
116080	117280	Thanks so much, Simon.
117280	127160	Great to be here on planet Earth somewhere, you all are, and I'm here in California.
127160	135360	It's a delight to be able to join Schumacher College, to meet Simon this morning, to see
135360	142280	Troy and Judith here, and I've been really enjoying the opportunity to teach a bit for
142280	143280	Schumacher.
143280	150840	I've talked twice now in the past, once in person at Dardington Hall, back in 2018, of
150840	158800	course on Whitehead, and then earlier this year online in Pandemic Mode, of course on
158800	162920	Whitehead and Gerta, and I'm doing that again later this summer.
162920	170120	And it's a real delight, both to work with master students at Schumacher College and
170120	172800	also short course participants.
172800	180480	I've found in teaching Whitehead that there's such a diversity of people with a diversity
180480	182400	of backgrounds that are interested in his work.
182400	188000	As Simon was mentioning, he's sort of touched on a whole variety of different disciplines.
188000	194560	He's not just a philosopher, or at least his philosophy is not just relevant to other
194560	202840	philosophers, it's also meant to be an aid to our everyday lives and part of an effort
202840	209560	to allow us to reconnect to a universe that, you know, in the last few hundred years has
209560	218160	really grown in size, in magnitude, compared to what pre-modern people were used to.
218160	224200	And so we're in quite a novel situation, and Whitehead's philosophy of organism is
224200	228200	an attempt to make us or allow us to feel more at home here.
228200	236880	So I'm going to try to go into, go until the top of the hour here and run through first
236880	245600	a brief sort of biographical introduction to Whitehead, who he was, the trajectory of
245600	246840	his career.
246840	253000	I think that helps make sense, it helps us make sense of how it is he managed to touch
253000	259280	on so many aspects of, you know, contemporary human life here on planet Earth.
259280	264160	And then I want to just step back and ask the question, you know, why would we even care?
264160	265160	Why do we do philosophy?
265160	266160	Why do we do metaphysics?
266160	271880	Why is it relevant to our lives?
271880	277960	And then I want to spend the remaining time going into detail, introducing you to some
277960	286840	of Whitehead's philosophical concepts and to try to paint the picture of a world in
286840	287840	process.
287840	290040	He's a process philosopher, right?
290040	297600	And so I'll introduce you to some of his categories, his concepts, his new words, neologisms.
297600	302800	And after that, you'll probably be full of questions.
302800	319320	So all right, let me share my screen here and thumbs up, Troy or Simon, if that's good.
319320	321160	Okay, great.
321160	324600	So there he is.
324600	332200	Whitehead was born in Ramsgate, England in 1861.
332200	337600	And by the time he, in his late teens, you know, he's already showing a lot of promise
337600	349880	in mathematics and he makes his way to Cambridge University, King's College, and Trinity, excuse
349880	353960	me, not King's College, and studies math there.
353960	359520	He studies with James Clerk Maxwell's student.
359520	366920	So Maxwell, of course, invented the or discovered the electromagnetic theory and developed the
366920	371000	maths to understand the propagation of light waves.
371000	376960	And Whitehead wrote his dissertation on the electromagnetic theory.
376960	384320	And so from, you know, his very first academic work and research, he is bridging mathematics
384320	394360	and physics and this connection between the abstract domain of geometry and the concrete
394360	401160	physical world remains of deep interest to him throughout his career, as we'll see.
401160	410880	So in, I think, 1884 or so, 1885, he begins teaching mathematics at Cambridge.
410880	417800	Around 1906, he and Bertrand Russell begin to collaborate.
417800	424520	Actually Russell starts as Whitehead's student, and they, you know, very quickly realized
424520	429960	that, you know, they were peers, to some extent, and that they should be working together
429960	439640	on a project that climaxed in the Principia Mathematica, which was a supposed to be four
439640	446880	volumes and ended up being three volumes, which was an attempt to prove logically that
446880	450080	one plus one, in fact, equals two.
450080	457040	And we might take for granted that this is a simple formula that even, you know, elementary
457040	460000	school children can can solve.
460000	466720	But in fact, as they discovered in the course of writing this book together, there are some
466720	471240	logical paradoxes embedded in this simple formula.
471240	478480	We don't really have a clear definition of what a number is, much less what two numbers
478480	479720	are.
479720	485000	And so Russell and Whitehead did really, you could say, inaugurate the whole discipline
485000	494320	of analytic philosophy by developing a quite impenetrable symbolic language that costs quite
494320	496000	a bit of money for Cambridge to print.
496000	500120	I think they even asked to just to do this, the type setting.
500120	505600	I think they even asked Russell and Whitehead to chip in a little bit of their own funds
505600	510240	to print the first 500 copies.
510240	515160	The book didn't sell very well, but it was nonetheless very influential.
515160	522160	So that was, I think, 1911 through 1914, that these three volumes came out.
522160	528120	There were supposed to be a fourth volume on geometry, which was going to be mostly
528120	529600	Whitehead's contribution.
529600	537200	But the war started and Whitehead and Russell began to have some tension around that.
537200	544320	Russell, of course, would be himself dismissed from Trinity College, Cambridge for his pacifism
544320	546520	and anti-war activism.
546520	552640	Whitehead, I don't know that he was cheering on the war, but his son, Eric, was drafted
552640	558960	and was in the Royal Air Force, and a few years later actually would be shot down over
558960	561360	France, I believe, and died.
561360	573760	And so given that just the difficulty around the loss, not just for Whitehead personally,
573760	580120	but for many of the European nations during the war and Russell's, you know, you could
580120	583840	say brave pacifist stance at that point.
583840	589000	Whitehead and Russell, who were good friends, sort of had a bit of a falling out.
589000	600840	And at that point, there was something else brewing in the international scene of physics
600840	603240	and cosmology.
603240	608800	Albert Einstein, of course, beginning in 1905 and then in 1916, had published his special
608800	611800	and general theories of relativity.
611800	618680	And Whitehead, independently of Einstein, had already been exploring, again, this relationship
618680	621800	between math and the physical world.
621800	629560	Actually also in 1905, Whitehead had published this article that was called Mathematical Conceptions
629560	631880	of the Material World.
631880	638440	And in there, he's exploring different approaches to modeling the physical world mathematically
638440	647360	and he looks at four or five different models and the fourth and fifth models begin to gesture
647360	653040	towards something like a relativistic understanding of bringing space and time into a more intimate
653040	657040	relationship than had either or two been done.
657040	666800	But Einstein was the real genius here in bringing together some work that had already been underway
666800	675960	with physicists like Lorenz and Minkowski and Reiman and others, building on the development
675960	680920	of non-Euclidean geometry to totally shift and transform our understanding of space and
680920	683960	time and gravity and matter and energy.
683960	692520	And so Whitehead was really swept up by this Einsteinian revolution in physics in the first
692520	695440	two decades of the 20th century.
695440	702080	It brought him more and more out of just mathematics and physics and into metaphysics.
702080	714280	So to set the scene here, in 1916, Einstein had made some predictions about how light
714280	718840	would bend around the sun and suggested that during an eclipse, we would be able to take
718840	725280	photographs of the moon blocking the light of the sun and see the stars around the sun
725920	732320	and we could actually measure the parallax, the degree to which the light from the stars
732320	739400	around the sun shifted due to the warping effect of the sun's gravitation.
739400	744400	Newton had also made a prediction that this would occur, but Einstein's prediction was
744400	747800	about, I think, twice as much as Newton's.
747800	752280	And so they could determine whether Einstein's theory of gravity was correct or not by observing
752280	754480	an eclipse.
754480	760000	Actually Einstein's first prediction was off.
760000	762000	He got the math wrong.
762000	773640	And lucky for him, the attempt to prove his theory in 1916, it must have been, was thwarted
773640	779560	because, well actually it was 1914, so he had developed a theory a little bit earlier.
779560	786000	And someone went off to Russia to try to observe an eclipse that was happening then,
786000	791320	but the war started and this scientist was arrested and his equipment was impounded and
791320	792520	he couldn't run the test.
792520	797160	If he had, he would have found that Einstein's prediction was off.
797160	802120	So luckily that didn't occur or Einstein might have been dismissed and wouldn't be the greatest
802120	804680	genius of the 20th century.
804680	810520	Einstein has another chance to redo his math, makes a new prediction.
810520	817960	Sir Arthur Eddington and a team of astronomers from the Royal Society decide in 1919 that
817960	824920	they're going to travel to the West Coast of Africa and to Brazil to have two teams to
824920	827560	observe the eclipse in 1919.
827560	832480	They're able to take some photographic plates.
832480	834480	They barely got enough plates.
834480	842240	It was hot and the mirrors were warping and Eddington was off the coast of Africa on this
842240	849440	island where monkeys were stealing his equipment and so it was not easy to get these photographic
849440	856760	plates of the eclipse, but they managed it and Eddington makes the announcement later
856760	862480	that year in London at the Royal Society, Whitehead is in the audience.
862720	870160	Eddington says, we have confirmed Einstein's predictions, light indeed is warped by the
870160	878960	presence of mass because according to Einstein, space bends, space time is warped, it bends.
880320	887520	That's what many of the newspaper headlines read the next day, there were headlines like
887520	895600	space caught bending and Whitehead reports the theatrical environment in the hall at the Royal
895600	906160	Society when these men and women of science are taking in this new discovery, the universe has
906160	912480	unveiled another aspect of itself, but Whitehead has some issues with this notion of space bending
912480	920000	and over the next several years you would have several occasions to speak with Einstein
921760	928160	at the statesman and philosopher Lord Haldane's home in London.
928160	932000	There was a party that Haldane through invited Einstein.
932000	938480	Einstein gave a couple lectures as well at Cambridge and elsewhere and Whitehead tried to
938480	942880	talk Einstein out of his implicit metaphysics.
942880	950320	He was fine with the physics and with the new geometrical tools that Einstein had developed
950320	955760	with help from other mathematicians, but he was worried about this notion of space bending
956480	962640	because the thing about measurement is that you need a rigid ruler in order for measurement to
962640	970880	be accurate and Whitehead thought that if space was allowed to bend due to the presence of mass
970880	976400	which is sort of contingently spread around the universe we're in a situation where before we
976400	981440	can measure anything accurately we first have to know where all the mass is, but to know where
981440	988480	all the mass is we'd first have to measure it and so you can see how as Whitehead put it we'd
988480	995040	first have to know everything before we can know anything and you know Einstein had a response to
995040	1000400	this that because over the the spread of the entire universe masses distributed more or less
1001520	1005920	evenly we don't have to worry about the warping of space over long distances,
1006560	1013920	Whitehead was not convinced, he thought that we needed to distinguish between space which was a
1013920	1019920	matter for geometers, geometry to figure out and physics, you know the mass which was what we're
1019920	1025680	trying to measure and if we conflate the two we end up with some logical and indeed metaphysical
1025680	1034080	paradoxes and so this set Whitehead off into metaphysics himself and he developed a whole
1034080	1040160	philosophy of nature and a cosmology which integrated relativity theory and also the
1040720	1047600	early some early aspects of quantum theory that were being developed in the 1920s and just as
1047600	1056000	Whitehead was beginning this work he was invited to when he was 64 I believe he was invited to come
1056000	1063920	to the United States to the other Cambridge, Cambridge, Massachusetts where he began lecturing
1063920	1070480	in the philosophy department for Harvard University. Whitehead says in his first course
1071760	1078000	as a professor at Harvard that it was also it has to count as his first philosophy course
1078000	1082560	himself, he'd never actually taken a philosophy course and here he was taking up the chair that
1082560	1091440	William James, a great American philosopher had held until like 1910 and Whitehead continues at
1091440	1099680	Harvard from 1924 until 1937 when he retires and during this time he publishes a number of books
1100400	1107840	on process philosophy or his so-called philosophy of organism. Process in reality
1108640	1115280	was published in 1929, it was actually a series of lectures he gave at the University of Edinburgh
1115280	1123680	so he went back across the pond to Scotland and gave the Gifford lectures and process in
1123680	1130080	reality is one of the most difficult books in the history of western philosophy. I don't recommend
1130080	1136320	that you try to read it by yourself, you may get lost and will never be seen or heard from again
1136320	1145760	in the thicket of new words and difficult arguments that Whitehead makes in that text, however
1147360	1153360	if you can find a group of other people who are weird enough to be interested in metaphysics,
1154080	1160480	studying it together is helpful, you can keep track of each other, you can speak with each other in
1160480	1166960	this new language that Whitehead develops and I don't mean to scare you off from studying Whitehead's
1166960	1175520	work, I just think it's important to recognize that he's really developing a new language in this
1175520	1182880	book and his subsequent texts which are a little bit easier to read, adventures of ideas, modes of
1182880	1193680	thought, some titles of his later books which take the dense technical and formal language of
1193680	1198880	process and reality and make it a little bit more digestible, but Whitehead's really trying to
1198880	1206400	develop a new language that once we learn it, it in fact alters our perception I would say
1206400	1215520	and we begin to inhabit a world that is no longer sort of the mechanistic common sense that
1215520	1222480	for the last few hundred years we've been raised to accept where we're in a sort of spatial container
1222480	1232480	with other solid objects in this container and that time is simply a measure of the change of
1232560	1237600	the location of these objects in this spatial container and that these objects including
1237600	1245280	we ourselves, we have no intrinsic relationship to each other, we're all what Whitehead would say,
1245280	1251040	we're all just externally related in this container of space bumping into each other,
1251040	1257760	that's the sort of more or less Newtonian picture that Whitehead thinks 20th century physics
1257760	1267120	completely demolishes and so let's shift them to this question of why philosophy is is even
1267120	1275280	important and you know why Whitehead was drawn into metaphysics, you know I spoke to this a bit,
1275280	1282960	it was he was really inspired by the Einsteinian and quantum revolutions in physics to move in
1282960	1288720	the philosophy but why, well because he felt that these revolutions in physics had demolished the
1288720	1296160	old mechanistic worldview, the old mechanistic metaphysics that had undergirded science since
1296160	1303680	its foundation in the 17th century, Whitehead refers to this as scientific materialism and it
1303680	1312160	was based on the idea, two main ideas which he refers to as the idea of simple location,
1312800	1318880	that a thing has simple location in space and that its location can be determined independently
1318880	1324160	of the location of everything else in space and the other idea would be this notion of
1325120	1331200	nature being fully present at an instant or say a bit of matter being fully present
1331200	1338880	at an instant so that there's sort of this notion of of matter as just this enduring lump of stuff
1338880	1345760	or substance would be the technical metaphysical term that just mutely endures indoors in its
1345760	1351200	motions through space or its endurance through time, it's just there right fully present at an
1351200	1357200	instant and with simple location. Now after relativity and quantum theories
1358160	1364240	demolished both of these notions of simple location and nature at an instant,
1365120	1372080	Whitehead realized that science was now advancing its theoretical understanding
1373360	1381280	almost floating in free air, floating without a metaphysical foundation and if you try to
1381360	1386480	understand quantum theory and all the the weirdness that ends up seeming
1388000	1392320	like a consequence of some of the findings of quantum theory you'll note that there's such a
1393600	1399680	disconnect between our common sense experience and what quantum theory is telling us like
1399680	1407520	Schrodinger's cat right in this chamber with a radioactive isotope apparently we can't know
1407520	1412080	whether the cat is dead or alive but it's worse than that we have to say that the cat is both dead
1412080	1417120	and alive at the same moment right this totally conflicts with our common sense understanding
1417120	1422000	and from Whitehead's point of view this is because we don't have we don't have the metaphysical
1422000	1428240	substructure to undergird our scientific understanding such that what we discover
1429280	1434960	in the special sciences whether it's in physics and the different aspects of physics or in biology
1435920	1443200	or in chemistry unless all of these special sciences have a metaphysical substructure
1443200	1447120	we don't know first of all how they all relate to each other just within science
1447120	1452800	but we also don't know how science itself relates to our everyday experience to our common sense
1452800	1460800	experience of being conscious agents in a world of other conscious agents who we think have some
1460880	1469120	responsibility for their actions who perceive beauty who you know have have purposes and
1469120	1476560	life goals how do we integrate the findings of contemporary science with the hardcore
1476560	1484160	presuppositions of our everyday lives Whitehead thought that the 20th century revolutions in
1484240	1491600	physics and even before that the metaphysics of scientific materialism and mechanism had
1491600	1498560	sort of left us in a bit of a muddle in a fragmented state because I mean before the
1498560	1504640	revolutions of the 20th century if you looked at mechanistic science and tried to integrate that
1504640	1510160	even though mechanistic science was Whitehead admitted a clear set it had a clear set of
1510160	1518240	principles everything was more or less understood the universe was a clockwork right that doesn't
1518240	1524400	integrate with our understanding of human life at all this is why you know Descartes an early
1524400	1530080	modern scientist had his dualism where the mechanistic world could be understood with
1530080	1536400	perfect precision mathematically but it was set apart from the inner realm of the human soul
1537360	1543840	right and this was a sort of a compromised position but as science advanced it began
1543840	1550480	to encroach more and more upon the inner life of the human soul but then in the early 20th century
1550480	1555840	as as this mechanistic metaphysics is called into question Whitehead seized the opportunity
1556480	1562000	to develop a more coherent understanding that was not dualistic that didn't separate
1562720	1569520	human consciousness from the rest of nature but that understood nature not as a collection of
1569520	1577760	objects blindly colliding with one another in empty space but rather came to understand nature
1577760	1589280	as a network of events you might say and this network of events is for Whitehead in in a process
1589280	1598960	of becoming that is inherently tilted towards complexity tilted toward beauty he would say
1599840	1605280	and when we think of nature as a a network of events
1607920	1616720	Whitehead thought that an event or an occasion a happening something like you know the the
1616720	1625600	agitation of energy described in electromagnetic theory that this was easier to bridge you know
1625600	1631680	the agitations of energy as a as a as a happening as an event is easier to bridge with our understanding
1631680	1640160	of experience because experience too is a happening it's not just an object in space right it is a
1640160	1646320	subject to which events are transpiring or for which events are transpiring and so in Whitehead's
1646320	1654880	universe subjectivity is understood to be pervasive not conscious self-reflective
1657360	1662880	you know rational consciousness such as human beings some of the time possess
1663600	1672720	um but a more basic form of experience which is uh simply the the feeling of inheriting a past and
1672720	1678960	anticipating a future right so every event in the universe for Whitehead is inheriting a past
1678960	1684800	and anticipating a future even if you think of the wavelength of light you know it's even if it's
1684800	1689920	highly repetitive in its inheritance of the past just repeating the same energetic pattern over
1689920	1694160	and over again Whitehead says well why is it repeating that pattern because it's enjoyable
1694880	1703120	right and so this is a point where many people who are perhaps more wed to the materialist worldview
1703120	1707680	and want to see human consciousness is something totally different Whitehead's going to give them
1707680	1715760	pause here and they're going to find this perhaps incredulous incredible but Whitehead found reasons
1715760	1724960	looking at and we'll go into this looking at the post Einsteinian post quantum study of physics
1726000	1733360	and looking at biology and evolutionary theory he found that he was justified in moving to
1733360	1740240	what's called a panpsychist or a pan experiential metaphysics because again his goal was not only
1740240	1747680	to integrate all of the sciences but to understand how science and human life can be integrated such
1747680	1753360	that the universe that we actually experience as conscious human beings would have some relationship
1753360	1760880	to the you know the the particles and the waves and and the galaxies and stars distant stars studied
1760880	1768560	by by science and so we do philosophy and metaphysics Whitehead would say
1770480	1778960	in an effort to to understand our place in the universe right and one of the best images
1780080	1786960	that I could find for describing Whitehead's universe was was this spider web with some
1787040	1795440	dew drops on it so rather than again a universe imagined as a spatial container with objects
1795440	1803280	within it I described Whitehead's universe as a network of events and Whitehead refers to events
1803280	1811680	also as actual occasions and these are actual occasions of experience right and each of these
1811680	1818080	dew drops you can imagine as an actual occasion of experience and that they exist in this network
1818080	1825280	or mesh work with one another is to say that just as each of these dew drops reflects all the other
1825280	1833600	dew drops each actual occasion is mirroring the rest of the universe and so there's a holographic
1833600	1841920	sense in which within each actual occasion at whatever location it happens to be in the universe
1841920	1851200	it is in fact containing within itself the entirety of its cosmic environment right and so if you
1851200	1857760	were to zoom in on any of these dew drops you'd see each of the other do do drops reflected there
1857760	1864640	and then if you were to zoom in on those dew drops you'd see again the repetition in a fractal
1864640	1870240	like way of the entire web and so there's this infinite nesting occurring in each of these
1870240	1879040	actual occasions of experience and in Whitehead's universe we're not just externally related to one
1879040	1889200	another from moment to moment we are including one another one another's pasts within ourselves
1889200	1894320	right and so the only problem with this web is that it it presents a sort of static picture
1894320	1900720	of interconnection Whitehead's understanding of the relationship among these actual occasions
1900720	1911280	of experience is in process right and so we'd have to imagine a more dynamic image whereby
1911280	1919120	these dew drops are constantly growing together into one another and then dispersing out again
1920960	1927840	if we think about this in human terms it's a profoundly Whitehead's is a profoundly relational
1927920	1936800	understanding of existence whereby you know as you're taking in my image and my words right now
1937760	1947040	yes it has to be translated into you know electronic pulses in a in a series of
1947840	1952320	transistors and and microchips and then sent across the planets wherever you are but then
1952320	1960560	it's produced through your speakers on your computer back into sound and my image is conveyed to you
1960560	1967840	and Whitehead is saying that the energy that I am expressing is absorbed by you and it actually
1967840	1975360	becomes part of you and when I get to hear your questions later you will become part of me and
1975440	1984480	that we're in this constant give and take with one another whereby we are literally making each
1984480	1993920	other from moment to moment and so it's quite a profound mesh work that challenges not only this
1993920	2000240	old idea of mechanistic physics that things exist independently of other things but it challenges
2000240	2009200	our modern sort of political and social sense of individuality at least if we take that to an
2009200	2016000	extreme if we were to imagine individuals existing on their own private island without
2017040	2022560	being constituted by their relations to others I mean it becomes quite obvious when we think about
2022640	2030640	developmental psychology and the maturation of of an infant in relationship to the mother
2032320	2040240	we can see I think in that dynamic the sense in which we really do belong to one another we really
2040240	2047360	do require our relationships with one another to be who we are as individuals and that's very
2047360	2067120	much in the spirit of Whitehead's philosophy so before even the 20th century revolutions in
2067120	2073040	science there was the first scientific revolution which was shocking enough right it begins with
2073040	2082080	Copernicus who rediscovered some ancient Pythagorean speculations about the design of the solar system
2083360	2089680	and you know Copernicus puts forward this hypothesis that actually it's not the earth
2089680	2095520	that's at the center it's the sun that's at the center and the earth like the other planets
2095520	2102000	is wandering in space so you know Copernicus throws the earth into motion this was profoundly
2102000	2112960	unsettling for you know the the medieval world to to take in and in many ways hundreds of years
2112960	2120000	later we're we're still grappling with the fact that we live on a planet that is in motion through
2120000	2129360	space and following Copernicus Kepler and Galileo and Newton developed laws of physics that allowed
2130320	2136560	allowed them to overcome this ancient sense of a division between the earthly and the heavenly
2136560	2142240	realms right the terrestrial and the celestial domains for Aristotle very different laws applied
2142240	2149760	in these two domains there was perfect motion above the sphere of the moon perfect circular motion
2149760	2155920	but below the sphere of the moon from the terrestrial sphere there was only imperfect
2155920	2162160	motion but Newton with his universal law of gravitation says note the same laws apply
2164320	2169760	in heaven as as as apply on earth and so modern science
2171920	2180160	inaugurates this new sense of the unity of the universe in fact and one way of looking at this
2180240	2187680	is to say that now post scientific revolution the earth is itself brought into heaven
2188720	2192640	I mean the materialistic way of saying it would be that the heavens were brought down to earth
2192640	2199200	but I think we can look at it either way and so you know from a contemporary cosmological point
2199200	2208400	of view Whitehead felt the urgency of providing us with a newfound sense of of where we are
2209200	2217840	right situating us in these vast expanses of space and time but just to think about our situation
2217840	2227200	in space this is a map as it were of our local galactic neighborhood with the Milky Way at the
2227200	2233280	center Andromeda off to the right and down a bit Andromeda is actually hurtling towards us
2234000	2239520	and we will collide with Andromeda at some point in the next I think
2241040	2248800	billion or two years it it might not be as catastrophic a collision as as you might
2248800	2254880	first assume two galaxies colliding there's a lot of space within each galaxy and while
2254880	2259840	the gravitational effects might distort the perfect spirals of these two galaxies
2260560	2268560	it's likely that we will survive or the earth will survive and that in fact this
2269120	2275760	the gravitational effects of this collision will seed new stars right so this whole understanding
2275760	2281440	of of our situation as a galaxy among other galaxies billions hundreds of billions of other
2281440	2288000	galaxies in our visible universe it's you know we're talking about a century here where this
2288000	2296240	has been understood and it's profoundly disorienting right there's been plenty of documentaries that
2297440	2303360	you know Carl Sagan maybe the first to do it and more recently people like Neil deGrasse Tyson
2303360	2314400	and others who just depict this this new story of of where we are and it's almost maybe we think
2314400	2320800	it's normal now we know the words you know to use to describe our situation but have we really taken
2320800	2330320	it in the magnitudes here are I think actually impossible for us to grasp we don't have the
2332000	2338000	the biological capacity given the proportion that our senses have evolved you know to allow us to
2338000	2343440	perceive I don't even I don't really think we have the imagination that is powerful enough
2343440	2347920	to really make sense of our scientific knowledge and for whitehead this was a problem
2349360	2356640	because if we don't have uh if we if we're not adequate if our imagination is not adequate to
2356640	2364560	our knowledge uh he he was worried that the very foundations of civilization would be unstable
2365440	2372560	because a civilization needs to have some sense of confidence in its purpose and to know our purpose
2372560	2378880	we have to know our place in the wider universe and so whitehead was very worried right about as
2378880	2383760	much as he was excited by the advances in science he was worried that there wasn't enough effort
2383760	2393040	being made to connect his uh this new cosmological story to our everyday human existence and this
2393040	2400240	is an attempt to depict our situation in time if that galactic map was our situation in space this
2400240	2407680	is a simulation of what happened hundreds of millions of years after the big bang as the first
2407680	2414400	clouds of gas condensed and gravitational forces brought them together to form stars
2415120	2417120	which form the first spiral galaxies
2423920	2428240	and so from whitehead's point of view right remember as I was describing this in the
2428960	2438080	with the spider web and the dew drops all of that space all of that time despite the the vast
2438080	2445120	magnitudes we're talking you know roughly 14 billion years back to the origin of of the visible
2445120	2452320	universe according to you know inflationary cosmology or big bang cosmology and the you know
2452320	2458080	hundreds of millions billions hundreds of billions of galaxies that we can observe
2459360	2467840	whitehead thinks that all of this is unfolded within each moment of our experience that it took
2469200	2476400	the entire history of the universe to produce each one of us right and you know we know we're
2476400	2485840	all stardust right and that even it took a second generation star to produce heavy elements through
2485840	2493840	the process of you know going supernova so that complex chemistry and the emergence of life
2493840	2500720	would be possible here on planet earth and perhaps on other planets and so whitehead really wants us
2500720	2509440	to feel the the energies and the magnitudes of this wider cosmic environment as as something
2509440	2518000	that is present within us as a potential and that is in fact giving us the strength and the power
2519440	2525120	to to move forward in the world as human beings in a creative way we are an expression of all of
2525120	2534160	that cosmic organization but how do we bring it down to earth how do we inhabit this planet
2535520	2543200	how do we make sense of of our situation here you know with grass and trees and clouds and the sky
2547520	2553280	let's hear from whitehead for the first time he says philosophy has to rescue the facts
2553920	2561760	as they are from the facts as they appear we view the sky at noon on a fine day it is blue
2562640	2569760	flooded by the light of the sun the direct fact of observation is the sun as the sole origin of
2569760	2572080	light and the bare heavens
2578720	2580480	conceive the myth of adam and eve
2583040	2585680	in the garden on the first day of human life
2586880	2594560	they watch the sunset the stars appear and low creation widens to man's view
2594560	2600320	the excess of light discloses facts and also conceals them
2602720	2606000	right and so whitehead is here pointing out the way that
2608720	2615680	there's more to the universe than what at first meets the eye which is why the scientific
2616320	2623440	process of discovery is so exciting and so with lauren we think we have understood something and
2623520	2627360	we continue to study it and then there's a deeper layer which reveals itself
2629920	2632960	from whitehead's point of view this process of discovery is unending
2633600	2640080	because the universe isn't just a finished object it's not a the big bang is not something
2640080	2648000	which occurred 14 billion years ago and then finished right it's still banging the universe
2648000	2656400	is still in the process of creating itself and we as scientific observers are a part of that
2656400	2662000	creative process and so in a universe of creative process we will never be done
2663520	2668320	knowing right knowing itself must remain an open-ended process
2670080	2676480	and whitehead wants to invite us into a new understanding of knowledge right and
2677200	2684160	this is where his understanding of science and philosophy relates to
2685280	2692880	education he was an educational reformer who while he was always teaching mathematics and
2692880	2699200	philosophy he was also involved in administration trying to shape the modern research university
2699200	2705840	to provide a holistic education for for its students so that students who majored in science
2705840	2711600	would also also take courses in literature and humanities and vice versa he thought that if
2711600	2718000	someone were to graduate from university only having studied engineering without any sense of
2719360	2728000	you know Shakespeare or without any exposure to to to Kant and the history of philosophy that
2728000	2736960	it really diminishes our outlook on the nature of reality and so for whitehead knowledge is really
2738720	2743920	important but it's a side issue the important thing is learning right and the process of learning
2745680	2751600	we do learn in order to come to possess knowledge but in whitehead's view we have to be willing
2752560	2757600	to not be possessive over our knowledge because it's going to constantly need to be updated
2757600	2764000	and expanded and so you know we could think of his view of of of science and the scientific
2764000	2768880	investigation into nature is not an effort to produce knowledge as though the universe were
2768880	2774560	just some fixed already completed collection of objects out there but science is really about
2774560	2784560	this ongoing process of learning and that in in many ways it is an end in itself right it's not
2784560	2790080	that we investigate as a means to arrive at some end where we will then possess the complete
2790960	2799120	and and final understanding of everything science is the process of learning the process of
2799120	2808320	discovery is itself the end right and we need to whitehead would say be content to remain in wonder
2808880	2814240	at this universe and ourselves are placed within this universe to pursue science
2815360	2819120	as an infinite task right rather than something that could finally be completed
2820320	2826560	you know whitehead says i often start my talks on whitehead with this quote but i'll give it to
2826560	2836160	you now that echoing Aristotle he says philosophy begins in wonder but whitehead adds at the end
2836160	2842480	when philosophic thought has done its best the wonder remains right and so the goal of the
2842480	2851360	philosopher is not to replace wonder with explanation to explain away wonder right by reference to
2851360	2859520	whatever mechanism might be favored in a particular era rather the goal of the philosopher and the
2859520	2871200	scientist is to elucidate and and bring some understanding to our experience of wonder but
2871200	2878160	that experience will always remain it cannot be explained away right and if science begins to
2878160	2884960	explain away the wonder for whitehead that's a pretty good indication that it has become dogmatic
2885920	2892400	and needs to be it needs the critic the critique of a philosopher to remind
2893920	2897920	to remind it that in fact we inhabit a creative universe
2901440	2908000	it's one more powerful line from whitehead and then we'll get into some of the details of his
2908000	2916080	metaphysics you know what i only have like five minutes left so we'll have to i'll give you the
2916800	2924240	quicker version of whiteheads entire metaphysical scheme so whitehead says in our experience there
2924240	2932880	is always the dim background from which we derive and to which we return we are not enjoying a limited
2932880	2940880	doll's house of clear and distinct things secluded from all ambiguity in the darkness beyond
2942160	2949360	there ever looms the vague mass which is the universe begetting us right and so for whitehead
2949360	2956960	this vague mass is what he calls creativity right it is this ultimate metaphysical category for him
2957840	2963360	and everything that we see around us everything that we experience in ourselves is an expression
2963360	2972080	of this creativity it's this creativity taking the form of temporary products right so creativity
2972080	2982480	is infinite productivity and then our bodies planets stars these are temporary sort of
2983360	2992080	achievements of creativity which enjoy themselves as they arise but then perish back into this
2992800	3000240	creative process but they perish back into the creative process gifting their experience back
3000240	3006640	to the whole such that the process of the universe is unfolding for whitehead is i would call it
3006640	3011600	cumulative right there's a memory bank and everything that happens in the universe gets added
3011600	3018800	to that memory bank so that the next moment to arise has this storehouse of experience to
3018800	3030480	draw upon to advance the universe one step further right so this is going to be quick
3031120	3038320	and do not expect to have by the end of this five minutes mastered whitehead's technical jargon here
3038320	3042960	but i want to use this illustration to introduce you to some of his concepts here this is
3043760	3048560	these are some daffodils and i'm going to explain the process of concrescence to you
3049120	3055680	concrescence is whitehead's term for how creativity or infinite productivity becomes
3056240	3062960	a finite product concrescence is that process whereby the infinite becomes finite but only
3062960	3068960	for a moment because the finite entity which has concrest immediately perishes back into
3070400	3073600	this you know dim background from out of which we arise and perish
3075760	3080400	so if we turn these daffodils on their side we can use them to illustrate illustrate
3080400	3086640	concrescence which whitehead defines as in terms of this i think almost magical formula
3087520	3093360	um concrescence is the process whereby the many become one and are increased by one
3094800	3102560	what does that mean well the many are perished objects in the past environment so the daffodils
3102560	3109040	here are let's say an actual occasion of experience right and each actual occasion of experience
3109600	3114720	begins by inheriting perished objects in its past environment
3116720	3123200	now in addition to the past environment whitehead also had this realm of what he called eternal
3123200	3130720	objects these are like platonic forms but unlike Plato's forms whitehead didn't privilege this realm
3130720	3137840	of eternal objects as the preeminent actualities right for Plato the forms were the most real
3137840	3143600	things that there were and the actual world was a pale imitation whitehead totally inverts that
3143600	3149760	picture these eternal objects for whitehead become deficient in actuality he says they're
3149760	3158320	pure potentials but they long for actualization and they're pure potentials so that they provide
3159280	3165680	the different forms of definiteness that become actual in an actual occasion of experience so
3166240	3172640	colors shapes sounds they're they're sort of like the adjectives that characterize our experience
3175120	3180320	so every actual occasion has these two poles to it a physical pole
3182080	3191040	and a mental pole right and so everything down to um subatomic particles and the most
3191120	3197920	trivial puff of existence and far off empty space up to um each moment of our conscious human
3197920	3203040	experience is an actual occasion which has a physical pole and a mental pole though for
3203040	3211200	very simple occasions like those associated you know with photons or protons or subatomic particles
3212240	3217040	these occasions are mostly dominated by their physical pole right which is to say that
3217040	3226000	they're repeating what has occurred in their past without much innovation now an occasion inherits
3226000	3233840	its past via what whitehead calls a prehension and a prehension is a feeling right prehensions are
3233840	3242080	the process whereby the past is allowed the objectified past right the perished past is allowed
3242080	3248560	entry again into the into the present to be felt by this concussing occasion of experience
3251440	3256960	now eternal objects are not you could say they're prehended they're conceptual prehensions but
3256960	3264240	whitehead also has a term for this called ingression so these pure potentials ingress into the mental
3264240	3271040	pole of an occasion to allow this occasion to again characterize what is it what it has inherited
3271040	3275920	from its past environment now without the ingression of eternal objects to provide
3276480	3284480	an actual occasion uh with some novelty some alternative ways of characterizing what it
3284480	3289600	is inheriting from its past then there would only be repetition right in each of these
3289600	3297760	occasions of experience and so the ingression of eternal objects provides some source of novelty
3297760	3303520	in the mental pole of an occasion so that it can innovate upon what it is inheriting from
3303520	3310720	its past but again simpler forms of experience say in the inorganic world they don't ingress much
3310720	3320640	novelty they mostly repeat the past right it's only more complex living organisms and multicellular
3320640	3329600	animals like like you know mammals and primates and humans who can ingress um these pure potentials
3329600	3336960	so as to you know really radically shift um from from what we inherit from the past and
3336960	3343600	do something totally new almost free we might say um freedom something like freedom seems to become
3343600	3350800	possible uh in in human beings we don't just have to repeat the past anymore but again the
3350800	3358400	inorganic world does mostly repeat the prehensions of its past which is why um physics can develop
3358400	3365360	such reliable um lawful descriptions of what happens in the inorganic world whereas it's very
3365360	3372000	difficult to um predicts how a human being will behave in a new situation but even us we still
3372000	3378800	have some degree of habituality right in our behavior but nonetheless we ingress we ingress
3378800	3387440	these pure potentials and are capable of quite a bit of novelty now this term subjective form is
3387440	3393840	whitehead's way of talking about the emotional quality that of occasion experiences as it begins
3393840	3398960	to inherit its past how does it feel about that past right that's the subjective form
3399920	3408560	and then the subjective aim is how in the process of uh concresing the various prehensions of the
3408560	3416000	past are led to grow together and and any conflict between them between the feelings of the past
3416000	3422640	is brought into contrast whitehead says and harmonized like notes in a chord that is struck
3423600	3428560	and so the subjective aim allows the the many of the past to grow together into a new one
3429920	3437840	right and achieve satisfaction as this new subject which for whitehead as soon as that
3437840	3444720	new subjective point of view is achieved it perishes right and becomes a superject
3444880	3458160	and this superject uh is a subject's way of um of persisting into the future of gifting itself
3458160	3464720	and the value that it has realized in its process of concrescence to the future so that it becoming
3464720	3469760	a part of the universe again can be taken up by the next moment of concrescence right so
3470000	3475200	the last thing I want to say about this is if we think about it um at the level of our own
3475200	3480080	psychology as human beings this this process of concrescence is meant to apply at multiple levels
3480080	3486960	right it's the it applies at the simplest level of of a wavelength of light and electromagnetic
3486960	3496160	propagation uh as it does to our stream of consciousness you know for for we psychologically
3496240	3506000	psychologically um complex human beings and what it what whitehead is suggesting in in our case is
3506000	3512080	the reverse of of the Cartesian understanding where Descartes said I think therefore I am right
3512080	3521920	which implies that there's an already existing subject me who has experiences right and or has
3521920	3530160	thoughts and these thoughts sort of um they qualify um my substantial self but my substantial
3530160	3535280	self the subject that I am pre-exists my experiences of objects in the environment
3535920	3541520	and um sort of persists as the same entity throughout my life whitehead is saying
3543360	3549920	that actually in each moment of my experience a new subject is emerging and rather than a
3549920	3556400	pre-existing subject having experience of objects in whitehead's universe the perished objects of
3556400	3566400	the past are growing together and being concrest into a new subject so a new subject grows out of
3566400	3573440	the perished objects of the past allowing the past which is finished and perished right to
3573440	3579280	to move again into the future um through the present and so each present moment of our subjective
3579280	3587520	experience is the result of the growing together of these objects and so whitehead says he says no
3587520	3593440	thinker thinks twice right and if if you're familiar with the first process philosopher
3593440	3599760	Heraclitus he says uh you can't step into the same river twice well whitehead is extending this
3600480	3606080	principle of process philosophy into our own conscious experience no thinker thinks twice
3606800	3614240	or we could say no subject experiences twice right because each moment the subject of perspective
3614240	3621600	that we are is arising out of our environment experiencing and itself as a new perspective
3622320	3627280	enjoying that perspective and then that perspective perishes and becomes an object for the next
3627280	3635040	moment to inherit and so in whitehead's view my identity my personality my sense of a flow of
3635040	3642480	consciousness is actually a whole series of these actual occasions a historical root he says of
3642480	3648320	these occasions which are in the case of my own consciousness intimately related to one another
3648960	3656000	in a way that you know my historical root is not as intimately woven together as
3657600	3663760	with your historical root and so we each have our own sort of flow of consciousness because we each
3663760	3670560	are composed of a of a distinct chain of actual occasions which are inheriting from one another
3671440	3679040	and so a human soul in whitehead's view becomes something that needs to be understood as a sort
3679040	3686560	of pulsing process of coming right rather than a substantial ego as it was as it was in Descartes
3686560	3693840	view we're more of a process right and we are a process that is constantly enfolding the environment
3695360	3700880	into us right and so we're not separate from the environment we are the environment
3700880	3708960	coming to take a subjective perspective upon itself it's a radically different view of who
3708960	3719200	and what we are from the typical Cartesian perspective so I will I will stop with that
3720160	3729200	I'm sure you are I'm sure your heads are spinning that's a good thing this is a very novel perspective
3729200	3735120	on reality and so if you're not confused then you probably didn't hear me but I'm happy to
3736080	3741280	discuss this with you and answer some of your questions so thanks for your attention
3744480	3746880	I'll stop sharing my screen here too there we go
3749600	3754800	so Matt I want to thank you very much for the first of all for the invitation into the confusion
3754800	3761920	but also for the clarity that you brought I really appreciate your introducing of white heads
3762000	3766480	biography and then deepening into the philosophy I get a sense of somebody who
3767280	3772560	wants to develop a language to enable a new seeing of the world but one that is corroborated by
3772560	3779120	science at the same time and it also gives the human being this this creative knowing
3780960	3784560	it has creative knowing and the process of becoming back to the human being
3785120	3789920	yes good so
3792400	3796240	the next session we're going to come we're going to give over to a discussion
3796240	3799920	and I've got some questions that have come in from the participants
3802480	3809040	and this is Jason and he's saying concerning whitehead and Einstein developing mathematical
3809040	3815680	physics this is to say that math wasn't really meaningfully applied to physics
3815680	3821040	or to the study of the material world before this point what does it mean more broadly to
3821040	3829360	have begun to conceive the world abstractly at this time yeah very good question
3830320	3835920	um no it's not to say that math isn't meaningfully applied to physics
3838080	3841520	there would be no modern physics if we couldn't meaningfully apply math
3844160	3852160	and you know whitehead was in in being critical of Einstein wasn't trying to say
3852960	3862080	that we cannot use mathematics to model the physical world he was simply
3863200	3869360	trying to suggest that we must be careful not to mistake the model the mathematical model
3870000	3877360	for the reality and so in the case of Einstein whitehead did not deny the practical utility
3878160	3887200	of a four-dimensional geometric manifold for making predictions about how bodies masses
3887200	3894080	move in space. Einstein's equations are very accurate in the predictions that they make
3894720	3903360	about large masses in space and in fact in space time even his his understanding of the
3903440	3910480	relativity of space and time has been tested by synchronizing clocks very accurate clocks putting
3910480	3915760	one of them in an airplane flying around for a while and coming back to look at the to compare
3915760	3922560	the two clocks the clock that moves in the airplane is slower relative to the clock that
3922560	3929840	remained on earth we've tested this so the the faster that an object moves apparently the slower
3929840	3941280	that time passes for it relative to a stationary observer so the consequences of some of Einstein's
3941280	3949600	equations while they may be difficult for us to grasp and imagine are nonetheless many of them
3949600	3959040	experimentally proven now but the question still remains given the physical accuracy of
3959040	3965920	Einstein's mathematical models what's going on metaphysically what is the relationship between
3965920	3974720	the model and the reality now one of the issues that whitehead has with Einstein is in he would
3974720	3980880	describe it in terms of what he called the fallacy of misplaced concreteness many people who have
3981440	3988880	not read whitehead directly have probably seen him cited in other works with with regard to this
3988880	3993280	fallacy of misplaced concreteness and this is just precisely to mistake the model for the reality
3994080	4000880	if Einstein's model of spacetime is correct in other words not just correct but if it is in fact
4002240	4006960	if there is no difference between the model and the reality then that says something about our
4006960	4013280	our human conscious experience of a flow of time it says that it's an illusion basically
4013840	4021040	and Einstein repeated this notion you know he famously wrote in a in a letter to one of his
4021040	4030320	best friends widows that upon the death of his best friend that you know for us believing physicists
4030320	4035120	the difference between the past the present and the future is nothing but a stubbornly persistent
4035120	4043600	illusion now for whitehead this is no basis for a purposeful human life to take that point of
4043600	4050320	view seriously and so whitehead like some other 20th century philosophers disagreed with Einstein
4050960	4058160	not about the accuracy of of his new model for making predictions but about the metaphysical
4058240	4068720	interpretation that Einstein was giving it Birxon Henri Birxon the the French philosopher had a
4068720	4075840	debate with Einstein in 1922 about the nature of time and and Birxon wanted to say hey we can only
4075840	4084800	do science because we are conscious beings and all the dials and meters and and doing the math it
4084800	4090880	all presupposes conscious human beings right um a clock can't get itself read without a conscious
4090880	4099200	human being to to look at it and for Birxon as for whitehead there's a a time a process of unfolding
4099200	4107600	that is um anterior to or prior to the time that is measured on clocks by physicists
4108880	4113840	and Einstein did not like this idea he didn't want to cede any territory to the metaphysicians
4113840	4121120	claiming this um concrete time of becoming as somehow primary but if we don't recognize this
4121120	4127520	time as primary as concrete then we lose ourselves in the abstractions of the model and we we begin
4127520	4133920	to denigrate the deliverances of our concrete experience by reference to the model which we
4133920	4141200	are told is what's real and so whitehead is just saying to Einstein and he's not saying we can't
4141200	4147040	use the tools of math to understand the physical world he's saying do not forget that we're dealing
4147040	4153920	with models and that um there's more to the concrete becoming of the universe than any model can capture
4157920	4164960	so hopefully that helps with that question. Matt thank you that also there was also another
4164960	4170000	question on Birxon but we've touched on Birxon a little bit um I want to go from the west to the
4170000	4174080	east we've got two questions around and this is normally this is quite a popular question
4174080	4181440	around western philosophers this um this this genre of question so and this comes from Jurgen
4181440	4186240	and also from Dennis what would you say about the connection between whitehead and eastern thought
4186240	4192960	say Taoism to me it seems almost as if whitehead is dressing Taoism in western language there's
4192960	4201360	a friendly smiley face after that one I should explain um and then also yeah does whiteheads
4201360	4207520	philosophy relate to the I'm sorry how does whiteheads philosophy relate to the Hindu-Vedic
4207520	4213440	cosmological concept of Indra's net or web if that is something you are familiar with.
4215600	4221520	Yeah um great questions Indra's net is precisely what I was attempting to illustrate
4221520	4229600	with my spider web with dew drops on it that is certainly an apt metaphor for whitehead's
4229600	4236960	cosmology with the caveat that we have to throw it into motion and make it more dynamic.
4238560	4245040	Whitehead's universe is not simply not that it's simple it's not simply though a holographic
4245040	4252160	universe wherein each part reflects the whole um it's also a creative advance whereby again
4252160	4257680	remember the definition of concrescence the many become one and are increased by one so the universe
4257680	4266960	is this um cumulative process that is continually growing the universe is never the same twice
4267760	4273600	and so when we think about the universe as a whole as all of these occasions of experience
4273600	4281600	reflecting or mirroring or containing one another there's also new occasions of experience
4281600	4286800	constantly being birthed which contain the entire past but carry it forward into the next moment
4287520	4293840	so it's much like Indra's net though with this dynamic tilt toward toward the future toward
4293840	4300480	toward the as yet unrealized future and you know in terms of the broader connections to
4300480	4306400	eastern thought uh eastern religion and philosophy whitehead says himself in
4307920	4317600	process and reality that his metaphysics resembles more um Vedic and and Buddhist forms
4317600	4324480	of thought than it does um anything in western philosophy uh or in the Judeo-Christian religious
4324480	4334800	traditions um and so he was quite aware of this he didn't study Taoism or Buddhism in any depth
4334800	4342080	so far as I know um he did write a book called religion in the making which was published shortly
4342080	4350080	after process in reality where it's clear he had done some reading in Buddhism he was impressed
4350080	4357680	enough by the Buddhist tradition to say that it qualifies as what he called one of the rational
4357680	4370560	religions and he certainly his his notion of of flux and impermanence right has quite a a
4370560	4375680	similarity to the the Buddhist notion of you know impermanence or emptiness
4376400	4383440	um the relationship of these dew drops on the web is also something you can describe as a relationship
4383440	4391440	of dependent co-origination uh which is an important concept uh for certain um Mahayana
4391440	4400080	Buddhist traditions and in the contemporary worlds um actually whitehead's work is being taken up
4400800	4410800	um by China uh there are something like 35 graduate programs in China devoted to process
4410800	4417520	philosophy and and whitehead's thought um two billion people 35 graduate programs so it's you
4417520	4424000	know a lot of people but still that's a lot of whitehead in China and I think there are several
4424000	4428480	reasons that the Chinese are so interested in whitehead's thought one is that yeah it fits naturally
4429200	4435280	with um the the Taoist and Confucian Buddhist traditions there but
4437120	4441680	my understanding is that uh you know the communist party is a little bit hesitant to
4442320	4447760	allow in those more ancient traditions and to they want to be modern and whitehead affords them
4447760	4453600	the opportunity to to be modern with his understanding of science and you know he's coming from the west
4454320	4461200	um but while still tapping into these these deeper um traditional understandings of
4461200	4468000	of the the nature of the universe as as Lao Tzu and Shuang Tzu and Confucius um
4469040	4473360	not that Taoism and Confucianism are the same but there are some similarities there
4475680	4482000	whitehead's thought allows uh China to in a way get in touch with its own history while also
4482000	4488400	moving more into the modern world and so his thought is exploding there I think precisely
4488400	4492880	because of the resonances that that are being remarked upon in these in these questions
4495440	4501120	Matt thank you uh I want to go in a different direction now and this is what to do with with
4501120	4507520	panpsychism and possibly consciousness studies and this is from Dennis who's saying Matt in your view
4507520	4514640	what does it mean to experience and the sub question from that is can particles experience
4517440	4523920	yeah good question this is a major stumbling block uh for many people who are new to whitehead's
4523920	4529840	thought though um what's sometimes called panpsychism is actually undergoing a bit of a renaissance
4529840	4537920	right now um even in analytic philosophy more philosophers of mind are taking this
4538560	4546000	idea seriously um even in the last five or ten years than ever before um whitehead's not the
4546000	4555360	first panpsychist obviously um Leibniz uh was a was a panpsychist um Giordano Bruno one of the
4555360	4561520	early modern scientists was a panpsychist um and so there's a there's a sort of venerable tradition
4561520	4568560	here it's a sort of um marginalized yes but still um readily uh visible stream in the history of
4568560	4575360	western thought even Heraclitus processed philosophy yes right um everything is flux
4576480	4581920	but Heraclitus also referred to everything as he says the universe is an ever-living fire
4582880	4588880	and so in other words life goes all the way down right life isn't something that just emerges
4588880	4597440	atop a physical substrate um and so for whitehead he protested against what he called the notion of
4597440	4605920	vacuous actuality a vacuous actuality would be um some sort of an entity which is imagined to exist
4606560	4611840	independently of experience whether its own experience or being experienced by someone else
4613040	4619120	he thinks it's a meaningless notion and the reason panpsychism is becoming
4622800	4629920	is coming more into the mainstream academic uh philosophical uh arena is because of the
4629920	4637200	difficulty of this hard problem of consciousness right which is if we do inhabit a physical world
4637200	4644640	that is not experiential at what point does something like conscious experience
4644640	4654400	arise or emerge um and and how does it emerge right if if in the physical world you have parts
4654400	4661440	that just rearrange their relative location to one another um and just mutely persist right as
4661440	4669600	these substantial bits um how is it that surely through a rearrangement of those inert parts
4669600	4675440	you could ever get something like an interior experience right or or uh experience of what
4675440	4683440	it's like to be somebody um it seems like not only a hard problem but an impossible problem
4683440	4689440	and so panpsychism is an attempt not so much to solve the problem but to to dissolve it and not
4689440	4694480	to have ever imagined in the first place that there would be a dualism between matter on one hand
4694480	4700800	and mind on the other and so you know whitehead's taking this track uh in an attempt to understand
4700800	4706000	how there could be conscious animals like us in this universe what must the universe be like
4706000	4713280	such that we are possible um is the question that whitehead asks and so he wants to push
4713280	4718720	experience down all the way to the simplest happenings in nature but remember he's a process
4718720	4731440	thinker so it's not that atomic bits of matter are or have experience um we don't want to think of
4732000	4740000	particles as little substances as as um little inert um you know globules of stuff
4742720	4749440	um remember in whitehead's metaphysics the universe is made not of stuff but of happenings
4750320	4758240	and so um a particle for whitehead let's say a hydrogen atom it's an enduring entity we can
4758240	4767120	actually see groups of atoms now under microscope and for whitehead that enduring entity is itself
4767120	4774480	he would call it a society of happenings it's a or a historical root of happenings that are repeating
4774480	4781680	the same pattern inheriting the same pattern from moment to moment as this helium or this hydrogen
4782640	4789760	atom right and so you could say the experience of the hydrogen atom is this rather repetitive
4791440	4796720	experience of just saying ah I am I am helium I am helium I am helium just over and over and over
4796720	4803520	again and there is indeed a vibration to these to these particles right and for whitehead the
4804080	4814080	vibratory signature is itself um an expression of this this process of um arising and perishing
4814080	4820400	arising inheriting the past and perishing and so we get the sort of um the vibrate the
4820400	4826240	vibratory pattern of this atom persisting uh through time and so what is experience in this
4826240	4835040	context well at the simplest level it's just the feeling of inheritance of a past and the
4835040	4840160	the contrast of the contrast between that feeling of inheritance and an openness to the future
4841440	4851120	and so if you can just just imagine the the um various form of like tension that might exist in
4851200	4858080	this present moment that is not closed off from the past and the future but it's held intention
4858080	4864160	between past and future between inheritance and anticipation and you know for these simpler
4864160	4870960	forms of of existence it's just a flash right and that that moment the present moment as you move
4870960	4876880	up the scale of nature and into more complex organisms the present moment can expand a bit
4877520	4884880	we can in our conscious imaginations as human beings we can we can hold the present moment
4886000	4891280	keep the tension stretched and taught and consider different possibilities before we
4892080	4897920	actualize one of them right for hydrogen atom there's no time for considering possibilities
4897920	4904400	it's just repeat the past repeat the past but always with some little bit of creativity
4904480	4909520	otherwise hydrogen wouldn't have formed stars stars were something new in the universe
4911120	4914880	you know 500 000 years after the big bang or thereabouts
4914880	4918240	hadn't been any stars and then all of a sudden there were stars where did they come from well
4918880	4925120	it's because these simpler forms of energetic activity aren't just repeating the past they're
4925120	4932720	also lured by certain possibilities to take on greater complexity and order and deepen their
4932720	4940480	experience so you know it's it's a difficult imaginative exercise to think of experience in a
4940480	4949680	way that's generic enough and general enough that it's not conscious reflective human experience
4949680	4957840	anymore but something yeah vaguer and just more basic but why did things you know if we give it
4957840	4966160	a try we can't imagine something um simple enough that it could reasonably be applied across every
4966160	4975600	scale of the universe thank you um we've still got a number of questions to get through but i'm just
4975600	4981680	gonna i'm gonna um because of the time i just want to balance the scales a little bit um and
4981680	4987600	take it in a different direction and bring it back to the human being this is um so i think
4987600	4991440	you talked about the transformation of the subject into this is it the super jacked
4993360	5001680	great okay um and this is a question from paul and it's rauti and other american pragmatists have
5001680	5007280	suggested that the contemplation of metaphysics has been a philosophical distraction for 2000 years
5008000	5014080	partly because we can't know what we know rather the goal of philosophy should be making life better
5014080	5025840	for all please discuss yeah so richard rauti called himself a pragmatist and i think you know
5027520	5032160	he he is a version of pragmatist um you know inheriting the thought of
5032800	5040080	william james and charles sander's purse and john dewey whitehead is also a pragmatist you know as
5040080	5048160	i mentioned he took up william james's chair of philosophy at harvard um a little more than a decade
5048160	5057680	after james had died and you know for for whitehead william james was he called james the american
5057680	5068000	plato um and thought that james put um philosophy and metaphysics on a new basis and what whitehead
5068000	5077600	found so important about james's philosophy uh was its pragmatic emphasis and so whitehead is
5077600	5085360	a pragmatist he is a radical empiricist in james's sense of the term um and so given that you might
5085360	5092080	wonder well why was he doing this abstract metaphysical stuff well you could say that
5092080	5100400	what whitehead did was take james's psychology um and if if you've read james's 1890 book uh
5100400	5106720	principles of psychology maybe you haven't read the whole thing it's it's quite thick but any
5106720	5113680	part of it um you'll see what a brilliant writer james is it's so accessible um and still very
5113760	5119120	relevant i mean you know neuroscience was just beginning to take baby steps back then but
5119120	5124480	so much of what james had described is is you know with a few tweaks here and there are still
5124480	5133760	accurate and whitehead's taking james's psychology and actually this this phrase um drops of experience
5133760	5141200	whitehead borrows from james's psychology and applies it to cosmology um james had some of
5141200	5147120	his own speculations and i think we could say he was a panpsychist of sorts but what whitehead
5147120	5154960	does is take james's psychology and systematizes it into a cosmology and so you know whitehead has
5154960	5161360	to do some system building um he has to develop all of these categories as part of his new
5161360	5169120	cosmological scheme because he wanted to make sense of science um and james might have been
5169120	5176960	somewhat unhappy with the this the systematic element of whitehead's philosophy james was suspicious
5176960	5183040	of system um he worried that it it would it would grow too abstract and disconnected from everyday
5183040	5189120	life and you know perhaps one could criticize whitehead on these grounds but whitehead himself
5189120	5196160	at least his intention uh was to elucidate our everyday experience he even goes so far as to say
5196160	5201040	right at the beginning of process in reality he says the sole justification for any thought
5201680	5207760	the sole justification for any theory is the elucidation of experience
5209920	5214880	and so what's driving whitehead to erect this whole cosmological scheme is he wants to make sense of
5216560	5223600	the universe that science is describing to us so that it can be understood as congruent with
5223600	5231040	and consistent with our everyday conscious experience and he thought that um already with
5231680	5236080	the first scientific revolution in the mechanistic world view that there was an incoherence because
5236080	5240480	the human soul was put off to one side the rest of nature was described as a machine
5241040	5247600	and then in the 20th century we couldn't even fit um the disciplines the sub-disciplines of physics
5247600	5253360	together as part of the same universe right because you know I didn't mention relativity theory
5253360	5261840	describes um the macroscopic universe as this you know continuous field whereas quantum theory
5261840	5267600	describes the microscopic universe as discontinuous they don't fit together these two theories they're
5267600	5271600	describing two very different universes and so that's the first problem whitehead wanted to
5271600	5276480	solve with his cosmology how can these two theories relativity and quantum theory describe the same
5276480	5283120	universe but also how can our physical understanding of the universe be related to our human conscious
5283120	5292400	experience right and how can we preserve um a sense of importance and purpose and value
5293200	5299120	and freedom and beauty all the things that are part of the human realm of conscious existence
5299120	5306560	right how can we take all of that seriously as real factors in the universe not just as
5306560	5311120	nice things that humans can believe in despite the fact that physically we know they're not real
5311920	5316800	for whitehead if if that's the metaphysics or the cosmology that's guiding our civilization
5317680	5324080	we're in deep trouble because that's a very fragmented worldview where we're asking people
5324960	5330160	to find purpose in their lives that they know or they're told to believe is actually
5330160	5335200	ultimately illusory whitehead didn't think that that was a stable foundation upon which to build
5335200	5342240	a civilization he thought that uh the scientific picture or scientific understanding of the universe
5342240	5349520	must in some way support the values that we presuppose as civilized human beings
5350480	5354400	and so his pragmatism comes through in his effort to justify
5357120	5366560	human human values in light of our cosmological understanding so how can we fit our scientific
5366560	5372880	understanding into a cosmological picture that would provide a source of inspiration for us
5373840	5380320	in our social and cultural and political endeavors rather than being at best irrelevant or at worst
5381200	5390160	a profound challenge to any sense of purpose that we might attempt to realize so yeah ultimately
5390160	5395120	I think whitehead is a pragmatist we already didn't like whiteheads metaphysics I think we're already
5395120	5405200	was especially influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein in this view where you know whitehead was engaging in
5405200	5413680	this form of metaphysics that you know is predicated upon the idea that language can
5416640	5422880	provide us some insight into the nature of reality of the world beyond words
5423760	5427280	and you know there are some readings of Wittgenstein that suggest that that's
5428240	5434800	just a a faulty understanding of what language is and what the task of the philosopher is which
5434800	5440640	is simply to to clarify our sentences and to make sure we know what can and cannot be said
5441360	5447920	whitehead wasn't satisfied with any sense of boundary um he didn't want to remain silent
5447920	5453840	about the apparently ineffable he wanted to be able to expand the dictionary as he said
5454400	5461040	and invent new words to describe realities that we hadn't even conceived of yet or hadn't yet perceived
5462080	5466000	and in this way he's you know he engages philosophy like a poet and that with new
5466000	5472400	turns of phrase we can actually enhance our perception so that the world we thought we knew
5472400	5478560	with the prior language is expanded as we begin to speak about it in a new way.
5485040	5490320	Matt thank you so much I want to thank you on behalf of all the participants for being
5490320	5496720	for being so generous with your insights with your erudition and also for fielding such
5497440	5503200	a broader broad array in the discussion from the questions there and just jumping in.
5507120	5510800	We've got three invitations and one of them is going to come from you because you're doing an
5510800	5518080	online course at Schumacher which is Science and the Soul of the World and that is 24th of July
5518080	5524320	to Saturday 28th of August. Can you say a few words to tempt people in?
5525040	5534560	Yes so um this is my second go at this course it's Science and the Soul of the World um it's
5534560	5544640	not just on whitehead it's also on a German um poet and scientist and statesman Gerritter
5545600	5549280	and what I'm trying to do here in this course is
5552000	5558160	reveal the ways in which Gerritter as a poet scientist and whitehead as a
5559200	5564640	mathematician and philosopher though they may seem like quite different
5567360	5571200	like they have quite different approaches to to understanding the natural world
5572160	5577360	they are in fact sort of ideal opposites that in brought into polar relationship with one
5577360	5583520	another can intensify our understanding of the universe and indeed a universe that is
5583520	5591600	ensouled a universe that has a soul um and that they these figures both whitehead and Gerritter
5591600	5600240	allow us to engage in science um not as a a method which would disenchant the world but in fact
5600320	5606160	there's another approach to science which they exemplify uh which allows us to um
5607040	5613600	to study it in a way that enhances its enchantment that in that allows us to deepen into
5614160	5620560	the life of the whole of which we are apart and so um I think we have six sessions together
5621200	5625680	and you know we'll go deeper into whitehead we'll go deeper in Gerritter we'll bring them into
5625680	5629360	dialogue and um I think it's going to be a lot of fun
5631920	5636640	Matt thank you and I think Troy has put the the link to the Datington website
5637280	5642240	into the chat so you guys can get it there if not if you just go to the Datington website
5643440	5650080	then you can find out all about that okay so two more invitations to join us um the next one
5650080	5657040	is for the Healistic Science Online um lecture series we'll be back on Thursday the 1st of July
5657040	5666560	again at 4 p.m. with Stephen Harding um and Stephen is sorry Stefan is one of the founding
5666560	5672320	members of Schumacher College and he will be presenting on Deep Ecology and the Healing of
5672320	5680080	the Earth and then there's an invitation to join us in person actually live live human beings
5680080	5685760	and that's at Schumacher College later in the year October the 1st of the 3rd that is for the
5685760	5691040	Healistic Science in Dialogue Conference um that's a collaboration between the Field Centre
5691600	5697920	Schumacher College and the Healistic Science Journal and that conference revisits and builds on
5697920	5704160	the contributions to Healistic Science made by Henry Bortoft, Margaret Colhoon and Brian Goodwin
5705440	5712800	so we'll have presentations, research panels and also discussions booking for for the live
5714000	5720480	for that live conference will happen as of next week so we have confirmed speakers Emma Kidd,
5720560	5727360	Dr Judith Sassoon, Claudio Stern and also a confirmed keynote is Isis Brook
5728880	5736320	so um once again thank you very very much to Max Segal um I'm going to say thank you and
5736320	5741200	depending on where you are where you've been tuning in from around the world all of you lovely
5741200	5746320	participants on behalf of the team I'd like to wish you a very good day evening or night
5746320	5758160	wherever you may be and hope to see you soon thanks Simon thanks everyone
