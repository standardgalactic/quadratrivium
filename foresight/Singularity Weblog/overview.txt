Checking Singularity Weblog/Joscha Bachï¼š We need to understand the nature of AI to understand who we are.txt
 In this conversation, Joshua Green discusses the nature of artificial intelligence (AI) with a focus on understanding its foundational principles to gain insights into the human mind and reality. He emphasizes that while most AI work is practical and applications-oriented (90%), there's a deeper 10% that involves exploring the philosophical implications and questions about our relationship to reality, much like Richard Feynman felt about physics.

Joshua acknowledges that most practitioners in AI are focused on development and utility, which is highly beneficial for society, but he himself is drawn to the more theoretical and less utilitarian aspects of AI. He compares this to his experience with philosophy, where he feels most practitioners engage in a form of "bad philosophy," but he strives to make it slightly better.

The discussion touches on the idea that while most physicists are not concerned with foundational physics, a small minority is, and similarly, most AI researchers are focused on practical applications rather than the deeper philosophical questions.

Joshua also shares his appreciation for coffee, a shared interest, as they wrap up their conversation. He expresses gratitude for the opportunity to discuss these topics and looks forward to future engagements.
