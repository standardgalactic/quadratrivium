00:00.000 --> 00:05.640
I just discovered a way to build a billion-dollar startup entirely from free open-source software

00:05.640 --> 00:08.000
from the most talented programmers in the world.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.140
Actually, everybody knows that already.

00:10.140 --> 00:13.240
Like, why pay an engineer when you can just use their stuff for free on GitHub?

00:13.240 --> 00:16.240
In today's video, we're going to cheat off the smart kid's homework and look at some

00:16.240 --> 00:19.200
of the coolest open-source libraries that you've never heard of.

00:19.200 --> 00:22.560
Tools that will make your apps faster, better-looking, and less expensive to run.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.640
You'll ask yourself, what the f**k, how have I not been using that already?

00:25.640 --> 00:29.880
And that brings us to library number one, the f**k normally when you type a command

00:29.880 --> 00:33.560
into the terminal, and make a typo, you just say f**k in your head, and then retype the

00:33.560 --> 00:34.560
command from scratch.

00:34.560 --> 00:38.160
The f**k makes this process much more intuitive, allowing you to simply type f**k into the

00:38.160 --> 00:41.120
terminal, then it will attempt to reformat your command automatically.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.800
To be honest, it's pretty f**king useful.

00:42.800 --> 00:47.160
Here's a problem that anybody who's ever built a website has faced.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.880
It's too slow.

00:48.880 --> 00:52.400
Even if you work really hard to create a tiny JavaScript bundle, the product manager will

00:52.400 --> 00:56.880
eventually tell you to add a bunch of other junk like Mixpanel, Intercom, and Google Analytics.

00:56.880 --> 01:00.440
These third-party scripts clog up the main thread, and will make your app slow no matter

01:00.440 --> 01:01.440
what.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.720
Luckily, there's an open-source library called Partytown that can run third-party scripts

01:04.720 --> 01:05.880
from a web worker.

01:05.880 --> 01:09.680
JavaScript is single-threaded, but modern browsers allow you to run background jobs

01:09.680 --> 01:11.000
via web workers.

01:11.000 --> 01:15.520
Partytown will offload any scripts that don't deal directly with the UI into a web worker.

01:15.520 --> 01:19.160
And that means the only thing on the main thread is your UI, which leads to a faster,

01:19.160 --> 01:20.680
more responsive website.

01:20.680 --> 01:24.480
Another problem that every app developer will need to solve is user authentication.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.960
Firebase is great, but it's somewhat feature-limited, Auth0 is great, but it's expensive, and that

01:28.960 --> 01:32.920
brings us to Supertokens, which is an open-source authentication solution.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.560
It provides SDKs for run-times like Node and Python, allowing you to quickly self-host

01:37.560 --> 01:39.840
a fully-featured authentication system.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.320
With support for OAuth providers, passwordless login, but most importantly, it deals with

01:44.320 --> 01:46.440
session management and security.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.480
Pretty cool, but it's got nothing on this next one.

01:48.480 --> 01:53.360
HiMom is a blazingly fast JavaScript library that can say hi to your mom in record time.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.000
Here's a pro tip if you're building an open-source library.

01:56.000 --> 02:00.560
Make sure that the readme includes phrases like blazingly fast, bleeding edge, holistic

02:00.560 --> 02:04.160
approach, and game-changing, because they make your library better, the same way putting

02:04.160 --> 02:06.560
flame stickers on a car makes it go faster.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.320
Next up, we have a two-for-one.

02:08.320 --> 02:12.080
Many businesses out there need to build their own full-text search engine, either for internal

02:12.080 --> 02:14.640
data or to build a search engine for their customers.

02:14.640 --> 02:18.640
You could go with Elasticsearch, but it's expensive and complicated if you self-host.

02:18.640 --> 02:21.360
There are two very promising open-source alternatives.

02:21.360 --> 02:25.800
One is MeleeSearch, implemented in Rust, and the other is Zinc, implemented in Go.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.240
Both provide a fast, simplified way to build your own search engine.

02:29.240 --> 02:35.760
Now our next library, TRCP, TPRC, TRPC, is exceptionally cool, but a little harder to

02:35.760 --> 02:36.760
explain.

02:36.760 --> 02:40.320
If you're building an API today, there are two main approaches, REST and GraphQL.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.640
I won't go into the differences right now, although I do have videos for that, but there's

02:43.640 --> 02:48.160
another less-talked-about approach called RPC or Remote Procedure Call.

02:48.160 --> 02:52.920
Basically, it's just a URL on a server, but unlike REST that corresponds to an entity,

02:52.920 --> 02:55.680
it corresponds to a function that you want to run on the server.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.200
This approach actually makes a ton of sense for many modern applications.

02:59.200 --> 03:04.940
TRPC allows you to build entirely type-safe APIs without the need for schemas or code generation

03:04.940 --> 03:06.360
like you would with GraphQL.

03:06.360 --> 03:11.760
Overall, I think it has the potential to fundamentally simplify the way we build full-stack web applications.

03:11.760 --> 03:16.520
Speaking of simplification, one company that has simplified the modern database is Airtable.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.200
The only problem is that you have to pay a company to use it.

03:19.200 --> 03:21.440
If only there was an open-source alternative.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.000
NoCodeb does exactly that.

03:23.000 --> 03:28.160
It's an open-source Airtable that can be built on top of your own MySQL or Postgres database.

03:28.160 --> 03:32.040
In other words, it's an open-source NoCode database or smart spreadsheet.

03:32.040 --> 03:36.960
As a developer, another piece of software you may want to replace is Postman, your HTTP

03:36.960 --> 03:37.960
client.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.840
An awesome open-source alternative is Hopscotch, which is built with Vue.js and TypeScript entirely

03:42.840 --> 03:44.360
as a progressive web app.

03:44.360 --> 03:48.520
Not only is it open-source, but you can go use it in the browser right now at Hopscotch.io

03:48.520 --> 03:51.240
and then install it as a PWA on your desktop.

03:51.240 --> 03:55.120
And now it runs in a native window and allows you to interact with your file system.

03:55.120 --> 03:59.000
Now, if you've ever coded in Python, then try JavaScript later, you might be shocked

03:59.000 --> 04:02.200
at how difficult it is to work with multi-dimensional arrays.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.440
What is this?

04:03.440 --> 04:07.720
In Python, we have libraries like Pandas that can do all kinds of useful stuff to an array

04:07.720 --> 04:09.100
or data frame.

04:09.100 --> 04:13.880
Not many people realize that there's a library called Danfo.js that is inspired by Pandas

04:14.040 --> 04:17.760
and can do many of the things you know and love, like read a CSV file and process the

04:17.760 --> 04:21.560
data within it before it gets sent to a machine learning library like TensorFlow.

04:21.560 --> 04:25.120
That's pretty useful, but the hardest thing in front-end web development is making your

04:25.120 --> 04:26.400
website look good.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.520
There's a million different tools out there that can help you do that, but one I've been

04:29.520 --> 04:32.360
really loving recently for React is Mantine.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.800
Not only does it have a bunch of well-crafted UI components, like this nice-looking timeline,

04:36.800 --> 04:40.440
but it also has a bunch of built-in hooks that handle many of the annoying things that

04:40.440 --> 04:44.520
you'll come across when building a web app, like debouncing an input or paginating a

04:44.520 --> 04:45.760
collection of items.

04:45.760 --> 04:50.480
On top of that, it has optional packages for a notification system, rich text editor,

04:50.480 --> 04:52.320
and a drop zone for file uploads.

04:52.320 --> 04:55.840
It's so awesome that we use it in one of the demo apps in the full React course on

04:55.840 --> 04:56.960
Fireship.io.

04:56.960 --> 04:59.720
Check it out if you want to build a serious app with React.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.960
Now the problem with all the libraries that we've looked at so far is that they require

05:02.960 --> 05:04.840
you to know how to write some code.

05:04.840 --> 05:09.160
If you have an idea for a full stack application but want to skip the whole Learn to Code part

05:09.240 --> 05:12.080
An open-source tool to check out is Amplication.

05:12.080 --> 05:16.640
It's a tool that can automatically generate both your front-end and back-end code based

05:16.640 --> 05:20.760
on relationships to data models in a database that you can manage visually.

05:20.760 --> 05:25.360
The back-end is built with other open-source tools like Node, NestJS, and Prisma, while

05:25.360 --> 05:27.160
the front-end is based on React.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.800
Even if you do know how to code, this is a tool that can speed up your workflow, and

05:30.800 --> 05:34.480
that gives you 10 new open-source libraries to try out in your next project.
