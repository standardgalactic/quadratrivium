1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
I just discovered a way to build a billion-dollar startup entirely from free open-source software

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,000
from the most talented programmers in the world.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,140
Actually, everybody knows that already.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,240
Like, why pay an engineer when you can just use their stuff for free on GitHub?

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,240
In today's video, we're going to cheat off the smart kid's homework and look at some

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,200
of the coolest open-source libraries that you've never heard of.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,560
Tools that will make your apps faster, better-looking, and less expensive to run.

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,640
You'll ask yourself, what the f**k, how have I not been using that already?

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,880
And that brings us to library number one, the f**k normally when you type a command

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,560
into the terminal, and make a typo, you just say f**k in your head, and then retype the

11
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
command from scratch.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:38,160
The f**k makes this process much more intuitive, allowing you to simply type f**k into the

13
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,120
terminal, then it will attempt to reformat your command automatically.

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,800
To be honest, it's pretty f**king useful.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,160
Here's a problem that anybody who's ever built a website has faced.

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,880
It's too slow.

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,400
Even if you work really hard to create a tiny JavaScript bundle, the product manager will

18
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,880
eventually tell you to add a bunch of other junk like Mixpanel, Intercom, and Google Analytics.

19
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,440
These third-party scripts clog up the main thread, and will make your app slow no matter

20
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
what.

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
Luckily, there's an open-source library called Partytown that can run third-party scripts

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,880
from a web worker.

23
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,680
JavaScript is single-threaded, but modern browsers allow you to run background jobs

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,000
via web workers.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,520
Partytown will offload any scripts that don't deal directly with the UI into a web worker.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,160
And that means the only thing on the main thread is your UI, which leads to a faster,

27
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,680
more responsive website.

28
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:24,480
Another problem that every app developer will need to solve is user authentication.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,960
Firebase is great, but it's somewhat feature-limited, Auth0 is great, but it's expensive, and that

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,920
brings us to Supertokens, which is an open-source authentication solution.

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,560
It provides SDKs for run-times like Node and Python, allowing you to quickly self-host

32
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,840
a fully-featured authentication system.

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,320
With support for OAuth providers, passwordless login, but most importantly, it deals with

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,440
session management and security.

35
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,480
Pretty cool, but it's got nothing on this next one.

36
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:53,360
HiMom is a blazingly fast JavaScript library that can say hi to your mom in record time.

37
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,000
Here's a pro tip if you're building an open-source library.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
Make sure that the readme includes phrases like blazingly fast, bleeding edge, holistic

39
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,160
approach, and game-changing, because they make your library better, the same way putting

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,560
flame stickers on a car makes it go faster.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,320
Next up, we have a two-for-one.

42
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,080
Many businesses out there need to build their own full-text search engine, either for internal

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,640
data or to build a search engine for their customers.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
You could go with Elasticsearch, but it's expensive and complicated if you self-host.

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
There are two very promising open-source alternatives.

46
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,800
One is MeleeSearch, implemented in Rust, and the other is Zinc, implemented in Go.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,240
Both provide a fast, simplified way to build your own search engine.

48
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,760
Now our next library, TRCP, TPRC, TRPC, is exceptionally cool, but a little harder to

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
explain.

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,320
If you're building an API today, there are two main approaches, REST and GraphQL.

51
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:43,640
I won't go into the differences right now, although I do have videos for that, but there's

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,160
another less-talked-about approach called RPC or Remote Procedure Call.

53
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,920
Basically, it's just a URL on a server, but unlike REST that corresponds to an entity,

54
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,680
it corresponds to a function that you want to run on the server.

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,200
This approach actually makes a ton of sense for many modern applications.

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,940
TRPC allows you to build entirely type-safe APIs without the need for schemas or code generation

57
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,360
like you would with GraphQL.

58
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,760
Overall, I think it has the potential to fundamentally simplify the way we build full-stack web applications.

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,520
Speaking of simplification, one company that has simplified the modern database is Airtable.

60
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,200
The only problem is that you have to pay a company to use it.

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
If only there was an open-source alternative.

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,000
NoCodeb does exactly that.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,160
It's an open-source Airtable that can be built on top of your own MySQL or Postgres database.

64
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,040
In other words, it's an open-source NoCode database or smart spreadsheet.

65
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,960
As a developer, another piece of software you may want to replace is Postman, your HTTP

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,960
client.

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,840
An awesome open-source alternative is Hopscotch, which is built with Vue.js and TypeScript entirely

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,360
as a progressive web app.

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,520
Not only is it open-source, but you can go use it in the browser right now at Hopscotch.io

70
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,240
and then install it as a PWA on your desktop.

71
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,120
And now it runs in a native window and allows you to interact with your file system.

72
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,000
Now, if you've ever coded in Python, then try JavaScript later, you might be shocked

73
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,200
at how difficult it is to work with multi-dimensional arrays.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,440
What is this?

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,720
In Python, we have libraries like Pandas that can do all kinds of useful stuff to an array

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,100
or data frame.

77
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:13,880
Not many people realize that there's a library called Danfo.js that is inspired by Pandas

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,760
and can do many of the things you know and love, like read a CSV file and process the

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,560
data within it before it gets sent to a machine learning library like TensorFlow.

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,120
That's pretty useful, but the hardest thing in front-end web development is making your

81
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
website look good.

82
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,520
There's a million different tools out there that can help you do that, but one I've been

83
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,360
really loving recently for React is Mantine.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,800
Not only does it have a bunch of well-crafted UI components, like this nice-looking timeline,

85
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,440
but it also has a bunch of built-in hooks that handle many of the annoying things that

86
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,520
you'll come across when building a web app, like debouncing an input or paginating a

87
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,760
collection of items.

88
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,480
On top of that, it has optional packages for a notification system, rich text editor,

89
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,320
and a drop zone for file uploads.

90
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,840
It's so awesome that we use it in one of the demo apps in the full React course on

91
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,960
Fireship.io.

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,720
Check it out if you want to build a serious app with React.

93
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,960
Now the problem with all the libraries that we've looked at so far is that they require

94
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,840
you to know how to write some code.

95
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,160
If you have an idea for a full stack application but want to skip the whole Learn to Code part

96
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,080
An open-source tool to check out is Amplication.

97
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,640
It's a tool that can automatically generate both your front-end and back-end code based

98
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,760
on relationships to data models in a database that you can manage visually.

99
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,360
The back-end is built with other open-source tools like Node, NestJS, and Prisma, while

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,160
the front-end is based on React.

101
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,800
Even if you do know how to code, this is a tool that can speed up your workflow, and

102
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,480
that gives you 10 new open-source libraries to try out in your next project.
