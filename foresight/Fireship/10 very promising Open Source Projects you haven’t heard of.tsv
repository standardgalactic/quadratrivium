0	5640	I just discovered a way to build a billion-dollar startup entirely from free open-source software
5640	8000	from the most talented programmers in the world.
8000	10140	Actually, everybody knows that already.
10140	13240	Like, why pay an engineer when you can just use their stuff for free on GitHub?
13240	16240	In today's video, we're going to cheat off the smart kid's homework and look at some
16240	19200	of the coolest open-source libraries that you've never heard of.
19200	22560	Tools that will make your apps faster, better-looking, and less expensive to run.
22560	25640	You'll ask yourself, what the f**k, how have I not been using that already?
25640	29880	And that brings us to library number one, the f**k normally when you type a command
29880	33560	into the terminal, and make a typo, you just say f**k in your head, and then retype the
33560	34560	command from scratch.
34560	38160	The f**k makes this process much more intuitive, allowing you to simply type f**k into the
38160	41120	terminal, then it will attempt to reformat your command automatically.
41120	42800	To be honest, it's pretty f**king useful.
42800	47160	Here's a problem that anybody who's ever built a website has faced.
47160	48880	It's too slow.
48880	52400	Even if you work really hard to create a tiny JavaScript bundle, the product manager will
52400	56880	eventually tell you to add a bunch of other junk like Mixpanel, Intercom, and Google Analytics.
56880	60440	These third-party scripts clog up the main thread, and will make your app slow no matter
60440	61440	what.
61440	64720	Luckily, there's an open-source library called Partytown that can run third-party scripts
64720	65880	from a web worker.
65880	69680	JavaScript is single-threaded, but modern browsers allow you to run background jobs
69680	71000	via web workers.
71000	75520	Partytown will offload any scripts that don't deal directly with the UI into a web worker.
75520	79160	And that means the only thing on the main thread is your UI, which leads to a faster,
79160	80680	more responsive website.
80680	84480	Another problem that every app developer will need to solve is user authentication.
84480	88960	Firebase is great, but it's somewhat feature-limited, Auth0 is great, but it's expensive, and that
88960	92920	brings us to Supertokens, which is an open-source authentication solution.
92920	97560	It provides SDKs for run-times like Node and Python, allowing you to quickly self-host
97560	99840	a fully-featured authentication system.
99840	104320	With support for OAuth providers, passwordless login, but most importantly, it deals with
104320	106440	session management and security.
106440	108480	Pretty cool, but it's got nothing on this next one.
108480	113360	HiMom is a blazingly fast JavaScript library that can say hi to your mom in record time.
113360	116000	Here's a pro tip if you're building an open-source library.
116000	120560	Make sure that the readme includes phrases like blazingly fast, bleeding edge, holistic
120560	124160	approach, and game-changing, because they make your library better, the same way putting
124160	126560	flame stickers on a car makes it go faster.
126560	128320	Next up, we have a two-for-one.
128320	132080	Many businesses out there need to build their own full-text search engine, either for internal
132080	134640	data or to build a search engine for their customers.
134640	138640	You could go with Elasticsearch, but it's expensive and complicated if you self-host.
138640	141360	There are two very promising open-source alternatives.
141360	145800	One is MeleeSearch, implemented in Rust, and the other is Zinc, implemented in Go.
145800	149240	Both provide a fast, simplified way to build your own search engine.
149240	155760	Now our next library, TRCP, TPRC, TRPC, is exceptionally cool, but a little harder to
155760	156760	explain.
156760	160320	If you're building an API today, there are two main approaches, REST and GraphQL.
160320	163640	I won't go into the differences right now, although I do have videos for that, but there's
163640	168160	another less-talked-about approach called RPC or Remote Procedure Call.
168160	172920	Basically, it's just a URL on a server, but unlike REST that corresponds to an entity,
172920	175680	it corresponds to a function that you want to run on the server.
175680	179200	This approach actually makes a ton of sense for many modern applications.
179200	184940	TRPC allows you to build entirely type-safe APIs without the need for schemas or code generation
184940	186360	like you would with GraphQL.
186360	191760	Overall, I think it has the potential to fundamentally simplify the way we build full-stack web applications.
191760	196520	Speaking of simplification, one company that has simplified the modern database is Airtable.
196520	199200	The only problem is that you have to pay a company to use it.
199200	201440	If only there was an open-source alternative.
201440	203000	NoCodeb does exactly that.
203000	208160	It's an open-source Airtable that can be built on top of your own MySQL or Postgres database.
208160	212040	In other words, it's an open-source NoCode database or smart spreadsheet.
212040	216960	As a developer, another piece of software you may want to replace is Postman, your HTTP
216960	217960	client.
217960	222840	An awesome open-source alternative is Hopscotch, which is built with Vue.js and TypeScript entirely
222840	224360	as a progressive web app.
224360	228520	Not only is it open-source, but you can go use it in the browser right now at Hopscotch.io
228520	231240	and then install it as a PWA on your desktop.
231240	235120	And now it runs in a native window and allows you to interact with your file system.
235120	239000	Now, if you've ever coded in Python, then try JavaScript later, you might be shocked
239000	242200	at how difficult it is to work with multi-dimensional arrays.
242200	243440	What is this?
243440	247720	In Python, we have libraries like Pandas that can do all kinds of useful stuff to an array
247720	249100	or data frame.
249100	253880	Not many people realize that there's a library called Danfo.js that is inspired by Pandas
254040	257760	and can do many of the things you know and love, like read a CSV file and process the
257760	261560	data within it before it gets sent to a machine learning library like TensorFlow.
261560	265120	That's pretty useful, but the hardest thing in front-end web development is making your
265120	266400	website look good.
266400	269520	There's a million different tools out there that can help you do that, but one I've been
269520	272360	really loving recently for React is Mantine.
272360	276800	Not only does it have a bunch of well-crafted UI components, like this nice-looking timeline,
276800	280440	but it also has a bunch of built-in hooks that handle many of the annoying things that
280440	284520	you'll come across when building a web app, like debouncing an input or paginating a
284520	285760	collection of items.
285760	290480	On top of that, it has optional packages for a notification system, rich text editor,
290480	292320	and a drop zone for file uploads.
292320	295840	It's so awesome that we use it in one of the demo apps in the full React course on
295840	296960	Fireship.io.
296960	299720	Check it out if you want to build a serious app with React.
299720	302960	Now the problem with all the libraries that we've looked at so far is that they require
302960	304840	you to know how to write some code.
304840	309160	If you have an idea for a full stack application but want to skip the whole Learn to Code part
309240	312080	An open-source tool to check out is Amplication.
312080	316640	It's a tool that can automatically generate both your front-end and back-end code based
316640	320760	on relationships to data models in a database that you can manage visually.
320760	325360	The back-end is built with other open-source tools like Node, NestJS, and Prisma, while
325360	327160	the front-end is based on React.
327160	330800	Even if you do know how to code, this is a tool that can speed up your workflow, and
330800	334480	that gives you 10 new open-source libraries to try out in your next project.

336000	338640	Thanks for watching, and I will see you in the next one.
