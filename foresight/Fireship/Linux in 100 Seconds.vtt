Linux, an open-source operating system that makes it possible for humans to play with computers.

00:05.520 --> 00:10.080
It was created in 1991 by University of Helsinki student Linus Torvalds.

00:10.080 --> 00:15.520
His goal was to create a free version of the Linux operating system, which itself was based on Unix.

00:15.520 --> 00:20.720
Today, it's used everywhere, like the vast majority of web servers, embedded apps like your Smart TV,

00:20.720 --> 00:24.880
mobile devices running Android, and is by far the best choice for your personal computer,

00:24.880 --> 00:29.600
with many different distros to choose from, like Debian, Arch, and Fedora, just to name a few.

00:29.680 --> 00:35.040
Just like Windows or MacOS, Linux is an operating system that manages a computer's memory and

00:35.040 --> 00:39.760
processes, allowing hardware to communicate with software. When you fire up a Linux machine,

00:39.760 --> 00:44.080
a bootloader will first put the system into memory. At its core, we have the kernel,

00:44.080 --> 00:47.440
which is like a seed from which the rest of the operating system grows.

00:47.440 --> 00:52.400
It's divided into multiple smaller subsystems, like a process scheduler, device drivers,

00:52.400 --> 00:56.880
and a memory manager. They're exposed with the system call interface, which itself is wrapped

00:56.880 --> 01:01.920
with the C standard library, which provides an API that user applications can interact with.

01:01.920 --> 01:07.040
Now beyond the kernel, we have applications that make the OS usable for humans, which are provided

01:07.040 --> 01:11.760
primarily via the GNU project, like a shell to interact with the kernel from the command line,

01:11.760 --> 01:16.160
windowing systems on desktop, developer utilities, and countless other applications.

01:16.160 --> 01:19.760
To get started, install your favorite Linux distro, open the terminal,

01:19.760 --> 01:24.080
and notice how we're logged in as the root user on a specific Linux machine. Currently,

01:24.080 --> 01:28.400
we're in the home directory of the root user, which is shortened to this tilde character. Show

01:28.400 --> 01:32.640
its full name with the print working directory command. Now use change directories with a double

01:32.640 --> 01:37.600
period to go to the root of the file system. Use the ls command to print all the subdirectories here.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.760
These are your critical system files. Let's go back home with cd tilde.

01:41.760 --> 01:46.160
Now create a new file with touch, then edit it from the terminal with a tool like vi,

01:46.160 --> 01:50.880
vim, nano, or emacs. In vim, type i to insert, write your screenplay, hit escape,

01:50.880 --> 01:56.000
then colon wq to write it to the file system. Now use the cat command to read the file. If it's

01:56.000 --> 02:01.440
really big, use grep to find all the lines in that file that contain a search term or pattern.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.200
If we want to see how big that file is, we can enter the disk usage command.

02:05.200 --> 02:09.360
Every file has an owner and a set of permissions assigned to it. We can change the owner with

02:09.360 --> 02:13.760
the chone command or its permissions with chmod. Now, if your current user doesn't have proper

02:13.760 --> 02:18.800
permissions, you can put super user do in front of any command to run it with elevated privileges.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.680
To install new software on this machine, we can use a package manager like advanced package tool,

02:23.680 --> 02:27.680
which will retrieve the code from the cloud and place it in the proper location on your system.

02:27.680 --> 02:31.200
We just went through a bunch of commands. Let's recap everything with history.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.120
