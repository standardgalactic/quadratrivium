0	5520	Linux, an open-source operating system that makes it possible for humans to play with computers.
5520	10080	It was created in 1991 by University of Helsinki student Linus Torvalds.
10080	15520	His goal was to create a free version of the Linux operating system, which itself was based on Unix.
15520	20720	Today, it's used everywhere, like the vast majority of web servers, embedded apps like your Smart TV,
20720	24880	mobile devices running Android, and is by far the best choice for your personal computer,
24880	29600	with many different distros to choose from, like Debian, Arch, and Fedora, just to name a few.
29680	35040	Just like Windows or MacOS, Linux is an operating system that manages a computer's memory and
35040	39760	processes, allowing hardware to communicate with software. When you fire up a Linux machine,
39760	44080	a bootloader will first put the system into memory. At its core, we have the kernel,
44080	47440	which is like a seed from which the rest of the operating system grows.
47440	52400	It's divided into multiple smaller subsystems, like a process scheduler, device drivers,
52400	56880	and a memory manager. They're exposed with the system call interface, which itself is wrapped
56880	61920	with the C standard library, which provides an API that user applications can interact with.
61920	67040	Now beyond the kernel, we have applications that make the OS usable for humans, which are provided
67040	71760	primarily via the GNU project, like a shell to interact with the kernel from the command line,
71760	76160	windowing systems on desktop, developer utilities, and countless other applications.
76160	79760	To get started, install your favorite Linux distro, open the terminal,
79760	84080	and notice how we're logged in as the root user on a specific Linux machine. Currently,
84080	88400	we're in the home directory of the root user, which is shortened to this tilde character. Show
88400	92640	its full name with the print working directory command. Now use change directories with a double
92640	97600	period to go to the root of the file system. Use the ls command to print all the subdirectories here.
97600	101760	These are your critical system files. Let's go back home with cd tilde.
101760	106160	Now create a new file with touch, then edit it from the terminal with a tool like vi,
106160	110880	vim, nano, or emacs. In vim, type i to insert, write your screenplay, hit escape,
110880	116000	then colon wq to write it to the file system. Now use the cat command to read the file. If it's
116000	121440	really big, use grep to find all the lines in that file that contain a search term or pattern.
121440	125200	If we want to see how big that file is, we can enter the disk usage command.
125200	129360	Every file has an owner and a set of permissions assigned to it. We can change the owner with
129360	133760	the chone command or its permissions with chmod. Now, if your current user doesn't have proper
133760	138800	permissions, you can put super user do in front of any command to run it with elevated privileges.
138800	143680	To install new software on this machine, we can use a package manager like advanced package tool,
143680	147680	which will retrieve the code from the cloud and place it in the proper location on your system.
147680	151200	We just went through a bunch of commands. Let's recap everything with history.
151200	155120	This has been Linux in 100 seconds. If you want to see more short videos like this,
