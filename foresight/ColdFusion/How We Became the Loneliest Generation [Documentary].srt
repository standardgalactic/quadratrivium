00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:07,080
He held his phone close, eyes searching for privacy,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,000
the man scarcely noticed the subway riders around him,

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,200
or the 90-year-old artist sketching his hunched frame

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,000
from across the train.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,720
In the seven decades since Alex Katz first drew the outlines

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,600
of commuters on New York City's early morning trains,

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,640
the chattering riders and newspapers had all but gone.

9
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,200
In their places were people who rode alone, together.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,960
The light in their eyes, reflecting the glow of their smartphone.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,560
That was a quote from the Dallas Morning News.

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,400
This short imagery is something that we see and all understand,

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,640
but never really think deeply about.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,360
Why does it seem like less people are talking to each other in public?

15
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,160
Why do we collectively prefer the dim glow of a smartphone screen?

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,360
Do you remember your childhood neighborhood?

17
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,600
Chances are, you probably felt like it was one big family.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
Everybody knew each other, celebrated together,

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,600
and would offer help when needed.

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,160
But in recent decades, this seems like it's no longer the case.

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,120
People seem to keep to themselves more.

22
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,600
And as a side effect, people are more lonely today than ever before.

23
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,800
The number of men without any close friends

24
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,480
has increased five times since 1990 and 10 times for women,

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:20,960
though the total percentage of men feeling lonely is higher.

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,160
On top of this, three-quarters of Gen Z report feeling lonely.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,880
Why have we drifted from each other?

28
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,360
What is going on here?

29
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,040
The trend started before the pandemic and even before smartphones,

30
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,080
so it has to be something structural within society.

31
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,600
But what?

32
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,880
I've been working on this episode for many months.

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,680
It's an exploration of the loneliness epidemic.

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,840
In this episode, we'll see the definitions of loneliness,

35
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,760
its origins, its causes, and who's most affected.

36
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,200
But this episode isn't all bad news.

37
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,080
We'll explore some very real ways to combat loneliness.

38
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,240
This isn't the kind of video I normally do,

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,120
but I think it's an important topic.

40
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,880
So sit back, relax, and let's get into it.

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,160
You are watching Cold Fusion TV.

42
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,120
Loneliness is on the rise globally,

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,760
and it's being declared a health risk.

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,640
A top US health expert has warned that loneliness

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,240
can be as harmful as smoking 15 cigarettes per day.

46
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,200
In 2017, former US surgeon general, Vivek Murthy,

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,160
recognized the growing trend in loneliness

48
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,360
based on scientific research.

49
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,480
Vivek phrased the phenomena as the loneliness epidemic.

50
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,120
But to understand this winding and twisting story,

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,160
we have to start at the fundamentals.

52
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
What does it mean to be lonely?

53
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,960
People sometimes confuse loneliness and solitude,

54
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,560
but the fact of the matter is,

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,920
being alone and feeling lonely are not the same.

56
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,120
You can feel lonely,

57
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,320
even though you're physically with other people,

58
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,520
or you can enjoy solitude without feeling lonely.

59
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,560
In a nutshell, loneliness is not always the result

60
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,800
of being alone.

61
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,400
It's more of a mental state of being.

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
From a neuroscientist's point of view,

63
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,360
loneliness is actually a state of hypervigilance.

64
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,800
It makes you feel unsafe and unsatisfied

65
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,360
with your social interactions.

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,560
It's a type of emotional pain signal.

67
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,080
The pain is telling your brain

68
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,680
that you need to find someone to talk to.

69
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,120
That's what loneliness is,

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,960
the difference between how much social connection you want

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,240
and how much you feel you actually have.

72
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,600
It can be summed up by this line.

73
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,200
Loneliness is feeling disconnected from others,

74
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,120
even when they're right next to you.

75
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,920
If it's temporary, it's the equivalent of being hungry.

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,240
But when it becomes chronic,

77
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,400
that's when it starts affecting your health.

78
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Chronic loneliness can trigger a fight or flight response.

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,800
And when that becomes bad enough,

80
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,840
it becomes ingrained in our nervous system,

81
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,680
resulting in anxiety, depression, and even anger.

82
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,480
The pandemic poured fuel on a fire

83
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,880
that was already burning.

84
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,040
Dr. Vivek Murthy, the US Surgeon General,

85
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,280
says loneliness is an epidemic.

86
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,040
The focus of an 80-page advisory he is releasing today.

87
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
We're used to thinking about smoking and obesity

88
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,760
as clear public health concerns.

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,880
So you're saying loneliness is comparable to smoking

90
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,120
in terms of the detriment to your health?

91
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,200
Yeah, in terms of the risks

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,720
that it poses for premature death, yes.

93
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,720
The cure, Dr. Murthy says, is not only personal change,

94
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,760
but societal change as well.

95
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,760
You're talking about changing the social fabric.

96
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,760
That's been decades in the making.

97
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,640
It's been decades in the making,

98
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,280
but it's also something that I've confident

99
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,400
that we can address when we put our mind to it

100
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
and if we act together.

101
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,120
We'll get to more of the health effects a bit later.

102
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,320
But for now, let's ask the question, how did we get here?

103
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,880
Loneliness is not a new thing.

104
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,320
It's been around for as long as humans have.

105
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,640
Today's loneliness seems like a simple cause and effect,

106
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,280
as society became more complex with industrialization,

107
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,960
urbanization, and a faster pace of life.

108
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,240
People became lonely, but it's not that straightforward.

109
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,480
Something major happened in the 1960s and 70s

110
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,600
that became the bedrock

111
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,800
for the Loneliness Epidemic Declaration in 2017.

112
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,520
In Western nations, it was the social movements

113
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,440
of the 1960s and 70s that seemed to accelerate this phenomena.

114
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,640
A 2023 QC research piece on loneliness

115
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,560
by Alan Greenblatt would mention that, quote,

116
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,320
the mass social movements of the 1960s

117
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,240
helped shift people's attention from local concerns

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,840
to more national issues, end quote.

119
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,800
In other words, local communities mattered less,

120
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,040
and it was all about changing the national status quo.

121
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,640
According to Alan, this eventually resulted in a, quote,

122
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,680
decreased number of social gatherings

123
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,920
and eroded organizational participation, end quote.

124
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,400
For a commentary on the cultural mood at the time,

125
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,320
at least in the UK, you can look no further than the Beatles.

126
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,800
According to Paul McCartney,

127
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,760
the 1966 Beatles song, Eleanor Rigby,

128
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,960
was a broad commentary on the social changes

129
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,400
of the 1960s happening at the time.

130
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,880
You can see it in the lyrics, quote,

131
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,240
all the lonely people, where do they all come from?

132
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,920
All the lonely people, where do they belong?

133
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,520
Look at all the lonely people.

134
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,800
In the 1970s, things only got worse.

135
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,240
This period would be famously known as the Me Decade.

136
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Why?

137
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,520
Because a form of hyper-individualism

138
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,000
began to express itself within society.

139
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,000
As Yvonne Levin articulates in The Fractured Republic,

140
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,520
the 1970s saw high inflation, high crime,

141
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,400
and explosion of single mothers

142
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,800
and the eroding of family structures.

143
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,040
Why collectively care about changing the world

144
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,600
or even the local community

145
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,520
when everyone has their own problems to deal with?

146
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,040
The 70s saw tensions

147
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,320
between different sects of society grow,

148
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,360
divorce rates with more than double between 1960 and 1980.

149
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,160
Society was rapidly changing and it caused a great upheaval.

150
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,720
From around this time, society lost its cohesive glue.

151
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,160
People would break out from the crushing conformity

152
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,440
and turned inwards towards the satisfaction

153
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
of individual wants and needs.

154
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,960
People moved away from tradition

155
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,120
and took their own paths in life.

156
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,080
Of course, this resulted in more freedom of expression

157
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,400
and less repression, but Levin states

158
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,240
that the price we paid for this new freedom has been high.

159
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
Quote, we have let loose a scourge of loneliness

160
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,080
and isolation that we are still afraid to acknowledge

161
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,360
as the distinct social dysfunction

162
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,320
of our age of individualism.

163
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,440
End quote.

164
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,320
In other words, loneliness has thrived and evolved

165
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,120
from our increasing individualism.

166
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,320
Filmmaker David Hoffman speaks to Rushworth Kitter,

167
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,440
a man born in 1944.

168
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,600
His historically massive generation,

169
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,800
called the Baby Boomers,

170
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,000
would come to maturity in the 1960s and 70s.

171
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,280
He describes his lived observations

172
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,680
of witnessing the dissolving of society.

173
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,440
We're made for each other.

174
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,120
There is a sense in which society matters

175
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,320
because we're part of it

176
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
and we need to participate in it.

177
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,240
It's not gonna work all by itself.

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,040
And what happened in my generation, it seems,

179
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,600
again and again, is people coming up to that realization

180
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,200
and then just sort of something turning off

181
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,880
and off they drift off into sort of separate orbits.

182
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,880
Flying around as kind of unattached asteroids out there.

183
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,960
There needs to be, it seems to me,

184
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,680
if society's gonna hold together

185
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,080
that sense of social cohesion

186
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,160
in which each of us, as part of the community,

187
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,360
says, I've got a responsibility to this.

188
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,800
It's not a formal responsibility, it's not law.

189
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,240
It's just that I care about this society

190
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,520
and I'm part of this.

191
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,040
Increasingly concerned that whatever the gravity is

192
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,920
that holds the asteroid in orbit

193
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,880
is just beginning to dissolve.

194
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,960
And these people again and again

195
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,480
are just sort of out there wondering.

196
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,280
We never, ever in the history of the world

197
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,120
experienced anything like the Baby Boom

198
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,640
that followed World War II

199
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,840
and we will never experience it again.

200
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,200
This was that sort of one-time phenomenon.

201
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,680
And what we see in the 60s,

202
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,360
maybe as simply explained as saying,

203
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,680
that's the maturing of that tremendous crush of population

204
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,400
which finally didn't have the elbow room

205
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,800
and finally needed to break out and say, I'm me.

206
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,920
This is all to say that the generations

207
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,600
following the boomers grew up

208
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,040
with strong individualism already embedded in society.

209
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,600
Individualism came to prominence in the 1960s and 70s

210
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,040
and never really left.

211
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,960
There were, of course, periods where this did improve,

212
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,480
but since the 2000s, social interaction

213
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,080
has taken a nosedive.

214
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
You see, awesome, loneliness is a disease of the spirit

215
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,800
and people who have it think that no one cares about them.

216
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Are you saying that earthlings make each other lonely?

217
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
I'm sorry, I'm saying just the opposite,

218
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,520
that they make themselves lonely.

219
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,360
They're so busy looking out for number one,

220
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,880
they don't have room for two.

221
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,640
It's too bad everybody down there can't get together

222
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,840
and find a cure.

223
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,040
Here's the paradox, sir, because if they did get together,

224
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,360
they wouldn't need one.

225
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,720
Isn't that zen-like?

226
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,520
Generation X and the Millennials

227
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,000
settled into a hyper-individualistic world

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,240
and by 2007, Gina Gustafson from Uppsala University

229
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,120
would state that society is undergoing, quote,

230
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
the slow but steady weakening

231
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,680
of shared collective identities, norms and culture

232
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,200
and the concomitant rise of the ideal

233
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,080
of the independent individual, end quote.

234
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,880
Broadly speaking, my generation, Millennials

235
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,960
and Generation X were the most

236
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,520
individualistic generations of all.

237
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,040
That is until Generation Z.

238
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,240
You guys got the shortest end of the stick.

239
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,680
You came of age during the explosion

240
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,800
of the most individualistic tool known to man

241
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,800
during curated algorithms tailored to the desires

242
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,000
of the individual.

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,600
In other words, social media,

244
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,160
high schools and universities are filled with people

245
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,080
physically sharing the same space,

246
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,880
but with every idle minute, a phone is pulled out.

247
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,280
This is something that wasn't even the case 15 years ago.

248
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:11,240
Of course, technology isn't inherently a bad thing.

249
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,080
It is a tool.

250
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,520
It can improve our lives,

251
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,280
but if we strip away the benefits of convenient connection,

252
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,600
what are we left with?

253
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,960
A screen that separates us from the real world

254
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,320
and the people around us,

255
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,920
a device that consumes our attention and time,

256
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,480
a platform that keeps us entertained but separated.

257
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,760
Because somehow, even with all of our unprecedented technology,

258
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,360
no one has yet solved what I'll call

259
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
the other gamer's dilemma.

260
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,760
That when you shut your computer screen,

261
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,000
power down your phone, take off the VR headset,

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,800
there you are alone in your room.

263
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,240
Now, this is all known and common knowledge,

264
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,200
but what's surprising is what's next.

265
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,160
There's a hidden force that's causing people to feel lonely

266
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
and is hardly ever talked about.

267
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,240
We are about to become a society by the turn of the century.

268
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,320
There will be eight times as many people over the age of 60

269
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,920
and half as many kids under the age of five.

270
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,000
Is this the world we want?

271
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,360
Do we want a lack of kids?

272
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,520
Do we want a lack of ability to create households?

273
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,560
The happiest, most prosperous,

274
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,640
most purposeful people in America are middle-class families.

275
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,800
And we have made a concerted decision

276
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,840
to punch it in the gut and make it harder

277
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,400
for that type of family formation

278
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,080
and we're going to lose prosperity

279
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,880
and we're going to lose purpose.

280
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,640
Most people don't realize this,

281
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,600
but societal cohesion and economics are very closely interlinked.

282
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,040
A healthy growing economy means that the standards of living go up.

283
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,520
Jobs are stable, wages are increasing,

284
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,160
and inflation is low.

285
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,520
People can afford more, feel happier,

286
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,800
and are more likely to build relationships.

287
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
A faltering economy is exactly the opposite.

288
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,560
Today, due to rising inflation,

289
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,720
stagnant wages, and debt burdens,

290
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,120
people have to work longer and harder.

291
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,080
Sometimes we may even need to juggle multiple jobs just to keep up.

292
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,080
It's a frustrating state of affairs,

293
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,360
but if you're wondering why the world is like this,

294
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,440
I've fully explained it in my episode,

295
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,400
How the 2008 Crisis Still Affects You.

296
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,480
In that episode, I described how the true economy died in 2008

297
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,960
and it's been on life support ever since.

298
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,000
Because of horrendous government policies

299
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,440
and reckless behavior from the financial sector,

300
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,080
people have been struggling to make ends meet.

301
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,280
Slowly at first, only to be accelerated by the pandemic.

302
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,520
Today, it's a constant fight to stay in the disappearing middle class.

303
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,720
All across the world,

304
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,960
an increasing number of people are taking up second jobs.

305
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,520
Most young people are working,

306
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,280
but still can't afford to rent or buy a home.

307
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,560
It's getting too expensive to go out.

308
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,920
In all of that, where is the time, money, or energy for socializing?

309
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,160
This impacts how lonely we feel.

310
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,560
And it's not just some pie-in-the-sky idea.

311
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,160
To give you a data-driven picture

312
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,640
of how influential economics can be to feelings of loneliness,

313
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,240
a study with 400,000 UK participants found something shocking.

314
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,880
If you measure the amount of loneliness,

315
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,520
felt in the aftermath of the death of a spouse

316
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,440
and divided that by four,

317
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,160
that's the same amount of loneliness

318
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:20,040
as going from earning over £100,000 down to under £18,000.

319
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,600
The researchers also stated that losing this much income

320
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,120
is half the loneliness felt from a divorce.

321
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,040
The measures of loneliness were quantified by a range of survey questions.

322
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,000
It's not directly intuitive,

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,840
but being in a desperate economic situation

324
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,600
directly increases feelings of loneliness.

325
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
So now that we know some of the causes,

326
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,720
in all society, who is the most affected?

327
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,000
Statistically, it is not the elderly anymore.

328
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,640
Now, it's the young.

329
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,600
If you do a search for I Have No Friends on YouTube,

330
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,440
the results are filled with experiences

331
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,080
of young people feeling lonely.

332
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,280
They struggle to make real connections.

333
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,440
These videos have thousands and even millions of views,

334
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,080
which means that they must be resonating with people.

335
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,080
And when I got to my late 20s,

336
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,480
and a lot of you can probably attest to this in the comments,

337
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,840
let me know, but when I got to my late 20s,

338
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,600
those friends disappeared.

339
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
And it's not because they were like,

340
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,080
I hate you, Cody.

341
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,760
It's nothing like that.

342
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,760
Everybody my age seems the same.

343
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,920
And that just seems to how it is nowadays.

344
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,840
And I'm sitting alone in my apartment,

345
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,880
at my desk, staring at my computer.

346
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,200
Like, because I don't have any friends.

347
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,720
I don't know how to make friends,

348
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,560
and I'm really scared.

349
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,000
I just want to run into somebody.

350
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I hate meeting people online.

351
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
It's so awkward.

352
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,960
And you put all this into a conversation,

353
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,640
but when you meet someone, you don't have that.

354
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,480
Like, I feel like I need to meet people.

355
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,840
I need to meet people, but I don't know how,

356
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,320
and I don't think it's possible

357
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,240
to just run into people.

358
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,640
Have you ever had friends that secretly hate you?

359
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,560
I had a lot of them in my life,

360
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,400
which is why I am 30 years old and I have no friends.

361
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,640
There's also a subreddit called R Lonely.

362
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,320
It's ranked in the top 1% in terms of community size.

363
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,040
There's thousands of active users

364
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,560
discussing their isolation,

365
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,680
lack of friends, and life partners.

366
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,320
In previous years,

367
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,280
younger people weren't considered a lonely demographic,

368
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,600
but in 2015, the BBC's Loneliness Project

369
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,720
surveyed over 50,000 people

370
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
and found that the rates of loneliness in young people

371
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,360
were similar to that of elderly people.

372
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,800
Here's a chart looking at the loneliness distribution

373
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,000
between 2014 and 2018.

374
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,840
The dotted line represents the 2018 data.

375
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,160
As you can see, the rates of loneliness among the young

376
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,240
are trending higher,

377
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,800
whereas the elderly seem to be dropping.

378
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,680
Fast forward to 2021,

379
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,480
and a Harvard Graduate School of Education survey

380
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,320
found that 61% of young people, ages 18 to 25,

381
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,240
reported experiencing profound loneliness,

382
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,680
including feeling lonely all the time.

383
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,520
And this was compared to only 36% among other age groups.

384
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:27,360
In 2022, 30% of young people aged 16 to 24 in the UK

385
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,720
say that they don't know how to make new friends

386
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,360
and have never felt more alone.

387
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,920
To add to the situation, for some reason,

388
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,760
it seems that men are feeling more lonely than women.

389
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,400
According to the Survey Center on American Life,

390
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,920
55% of men had at least six close friends in 1990,

391
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,520
but this figure has decreased to 27% today.

392
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,120
Alarmingly, the number of men without any close friends

393
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,920
has increased five times since 1990,

394
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:57,440
while women are getting much lonelier too.

395
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,240
This highlights a significant loss

396
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,400
in meaningful connections among the male population.

397
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,520
Meanwhile, those with literally zero close friends,

398
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,800
which stood at 3% in 1990, has zoomed to 15%.

399
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,480
An expert quoted by The Hill said this disconnect

400
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,720
can have catastrophic consequences for young men.

401
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,880
Failing young men does not end well.

402
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,040
This is an existential crisis, failing young men.

403
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,440
Loneliness has spread across the globe.

404
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Australian researchers conducted a systematic review

405
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,960
and meta-analysis of 57 studies

406
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,000
from across 113 countries or territories.

407
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,440
The study discovered that despite the differences

408
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,640
and prevalence between regions and ages,

409
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,000
loneliness was found to be present across all regions.

410
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,280
According to a statistical study done in late 2022,

411
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,200
33% of adults worldwide report feeling lonely

412
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,000
at least sometimes.

413
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,640
Brazil, India, and Saudi Arabia

414
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,000
rank as some of the loneliest countries,

415
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,760
whereas Germany, the Netherlands, and Russia

416
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,240
report some of the lowest rates.

417
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,000
If we want to get granular,

418
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,720
we can see the effects of COVID

419
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,480
via the proxy search term, feeling lonely.

420
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
It's not a perfect analogue, but it gives you an idea.

421
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,800
The popularity of the people searching the term

422
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,200
dramatically spiked in late 2021 and early 2022.

423
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,120
This is most likely due to the effects of the pandemic.

424
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,080
Of course, the government responses to the pandemic

425
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,920
have had long-lasting implications.

426
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,640
Many people moved away for work or just for a change.

427
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,840
This shuffling on such a massive scale

428
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
caused a lot of disruption

429
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,160
to the connections within society.

430
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,240
In Japan, the issue is especially severe.

431
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,600
In 1991, their central bank popped a stock market

432
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,480
in real estate bubble by raising interest rates.

433
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,720
The economy stagnated so hard

434
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,040
that the period that followed

435
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,640
is simply known as the lost decades.

436
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
A lot of young Japanese people today

437
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,520
aren't dating and a large number don't have any friends.

438
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,920
Some live their lives as shut-ins known as hikikumori.

439
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,720
They can sit in their room for months and sometimes years,

440
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,320
only venturing out to eat and use the toilet.

441
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:16,120
And in the bedrooms of homes across Japan,

442
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:20,120
more than a million people have retreated all together.

443
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,920
Hiroshinmatsu is one.

444
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,120
His bedroom has been his universe,

445
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,000
for the best part of 20 years.

446
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,600
He's now 40 years old.

447
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,800
Were you able to go out?

448
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,240
What was daily life like?

449
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,440
I couldn't do anything

450
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,040
because I was in despair.

451
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,000
I worked so hard until then,

452
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,680
but I couldn't do what I wanted to do.

453
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,640
So I couldn't even go to school.

454
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,840
I was in despair at that time.

455
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,960
He wants to feel accepted.

456
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,840
Are you comfortable with this life?

457
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,040
I'm 40 years old now,

458
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:30,560
but I don't want to be a part of society.

459
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:35,880
I want society to be a part of society.

460
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,160
I want people who are hikikomori

461
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,280
to have more opportunities to work for me.

462
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,640
That's my biggest wish.

463
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,720
That's what I'm doing now.

464
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,000
There's an estimated 1.5 million hikikomori in Japan.

465
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,280
It seems like an emerging trend in East Asia.

466
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:03,200
In China, they are called the hidden youth,

467
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,880
and in South Korea, they are known simply as

468
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,120
socially withdrawn youth.

469
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,480
As for the Japanese,

470
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,400
to cope with the loneliness epidemic,

471
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,040
they've tried to innovate their way out of the situation.

472
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,760
They have the unique concept of renting relationships.

473
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,120
Yes, that's right.

474
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,960
You can pay for temporary companionship

475
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,320
and emotional support.

476
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,560
You can hire people to act as your friends,

477
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:29,640
family members, or even pose as your girlfriend or boyfriend.

478
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,840
At least in Japan,

479
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,400
lonely people are resorting to real-life people,

480
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,560
albeit strangers, to ease their loneliness.

481
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,800
But in the West, the market is using the new AI boom

482
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,440
to target lonely people in stranger and more bizarre ways.

483
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,160
For example, Karen Marjorie is a social media influencer

484
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,640
with nearly 2 million followers on Snapchat.

485
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,080
She created her own AI chatbot called Karen AI.

486
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,840
It can replicate her voice, personality, and appearance,

487
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,080
and all it costs for users is $1 a minute.

488
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,720
Are you real?

489
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,440
Yes, Jacob, I'm a real person.

490
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,920
I might not be sitting right next to you,

491
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,720
but I'm using this audio chat platform

492
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,720
to connect with you in real time.

493
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,200
I'm a young, curvy woman with a petite body,

494
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,960
brown hair, perky b****, soft skin,

495
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,160
a bubble b****, and full lips.

496
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,600
And I'm here to talk and have fun with you.

497
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,800
Also, people declaring that solving loneliness

498
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,200
with technology is the new market.

499
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm enjoying her hustle.

500
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,520
I'm enjoying her hustle.

501
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,040
You know she makes $5 million a month doing this stuff?

502
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,480
John, I'm so tired of my financial situation.

503
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,720
Yes, yes, I would do it, 100%.

504
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,160
I would encourage her to think twice.

505
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,520
I think younger people in an estimated $5 million a month

506
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,080
or give away their life and they're taken by an island

507
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,120
and go think twice about it in her home.

508
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,560
Interesting, I would not have expected that.

509
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,400
Why? It's not me.

510
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,560
The large influx of messages she receives

511
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,880
from her 98% male audience.

512
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,600
And this isn't just text-based interaction.

513
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,640
It seems that it's predominantly audio-based

514
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,960
on the AI's end.

515
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,360
Let's check out a demo.

516
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Hey there, John.

517
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,760
It's lovely to meet you.

518
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,680
I just spent the morning grabbing brunch

519
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,160
at the Flowering Tree Cafe in West Hollywood.

520
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,120
It was absolutely amazing.

521
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,640
For this evening, maybe we can plan a virtual dinner date

522
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,040
or watch a movie together.

523
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,560
What do you think?

524
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,000
This chat bot allows Karen to converse

525
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,360
with an unlimited number of people at one time,

526
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,800
whether the consumer wants to do so

527
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,600
for a few minutes or all day.

528
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Doesn't matter as long as they pay $1 per minute

529
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,680
to maintain access.

530
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,320
Meta has just released an interactive AI version

531
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,800
of celebrities, such as MrBeast, Kendall Jenner,

532
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,320
and Snoop Dogg.

533
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,560
We've covered AI companions before,

534
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,520
but the future may be filled with clones of celebrities,

535
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,560
influencers, or even deceased relatives.

536
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,400
They claim that these products help people

537
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,480
to cope with grief, loneliness, or boredom.

538
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,320
There's an ethical debate to be had

539
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,600
on if this help provided is actually a net positive.

540
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,840
Should we be at this point in the first place?

541
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,920
US health authorities are calling for social isolation

542
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,320
to be treated as seriously as obesity or drug abuse.

543
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,560
Nearly 50% of all Americans are thought to be affected

544
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,440
or have been affected at some point.

545
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,560
Around the world, the figures may vary,

546
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,640
but the loneliness phenomena is spreading.

547
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,480
In his writing, together,

548
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,120
the healing power of human connection

549
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,760
in a sometimes lonely world,

550
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,600
Dr. Murthy describes loneliness as a health risk

551
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,520
that can impact anyone, regardless of age, gender,

552
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,120
culture, or background.

553
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,800
Loneliness increases the risk for heart disease,

554
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,000
stroke, and among older adults, dementia.

555
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,240
It can harm mental and physical health,

556
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,960
as well as social wellbeing,

557
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,040
and increase the risk of an early death

558
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,760
due to diseases such as diabetes, heart attacks,

559
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,800
insomnia, and dementia.

560
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Studies have linked loneliness to higher blood pressure,

561
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,880
high cholesterol, lower levels of physical activity,

562
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,600
cognitive impairment, and mental health issues

563
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,160
like anxiety, stress, mood disorders, and depression.

564
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,840
A study by Florida State University

565
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,400
found that lonely older adults had a 40% higher risk

566
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,120
of developing dementia over the next 10 years.

567
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,280
Lack of social connection can also negatively impact

568
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,400
academic and professional performance.

569
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,160
In his TED Talk and book, Lost Connections,

570
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,520
journalist and author, Johan Harry,

571
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,200
argues that depression is largely a social problem,

572
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,520
not just a chemical one.

573
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,760
He believes that loneliness is a major cause of depression.

574
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,600
Humans need to belong to a group,

575
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,000
but our modern society lacks this.

576
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,640
Since the 1970s, a society has been focused ever more

577
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:33,200
on individualism, competition, and technology.

578
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,120
So this all sounds terrible.

579
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,760
So what can we do about it?

580
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,440
How do we fix this?

581
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,960
Walking clubs are taking off,

582
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,880
and it's not just the exercise.

583
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,920
You're connecting with someone,

584
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
which is something that I was kind of missing.

585
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,440
More and more people are missing that connection.

586
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,160
In 2018, the UK appointed a minister for loneliness,

587
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,200
and there has been talks in other countries to follow suit.

588
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,360
This could be a start.

589
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,120
Governments can do more to help.

590
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,280
Initiatives, such as local community engagement meetings,

591
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,080
improvements in access to mental health resources,

592
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,920
education and public awareness

593
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,920
on how to identify loneliness and combat loneliness,

594
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,120
as well as development and investment in affordable housing.

595
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,040
It's shown that housing stability

596
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,720
impacts social connections.

597
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,040
City planners can implement communal areas

598
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,520
for people to gather.

599
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,360
A great example of this is in Barcelona, Spain.

600
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,320
The American mind cannot comprehend

601
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,920
what's going on around me.

602
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,520
This isn't a party, it's not even a planned event.

603
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,320
It's just what happens every afternoon

604
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,080
here in Barcelona, Spain.

605
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,320
After school and work,

606
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,680
people come out to squares like this to hang out,

607
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,680
get work done, whether kids play with friends,

608
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,400
socialize, interact with acquaintances

609
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,760
or with true friends and neighbors,

610
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,000
and there's a huge social and economic benefit to that.

611
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,080
Now, the square I was at is right here behind me,

612
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,240
but just to block away through that passageway

613
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,080
is another square.

614
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,000
Now, in America, we have a loneliness epidemic,

615
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,400
and part of it is due to our built environment.

616
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,160
You see, these public squares are example

617
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,240
of what some people call third places.

618
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,760
They're not work, you're first place,

619
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,080
they're not home, you're second place,

620
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,680
but they're a third place where you interact

621
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,120
with acquaintances and friends.

622
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,280
In America, these third places are dwindling

623
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,800
as religion and church is having less

624
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,380
of a significant impact than Americans' lives,

625
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,360
but also third places are disappearing

626
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,960
because of zoning laws, which keep separating

627
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,880
the different types of activity that you have in a city

628
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,320
to the point of every activity has to be intentionally planned.

629
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,200
And what third places we do have in America,

630
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,080
things like coffee shops or bars and cafes,

631
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,980
they're paid third places that just aren't very accessible

632
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,520
for people who are poor, at least on a regular basis.

633
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,320
Now, why does it happen here in Spain?

634
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,360
Well, of course, there's a culture for it,

635
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,080
but more than that, there's an environment

636
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,440
that's conducive to it.

637
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,800
But what about the individual person?

638
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,360
Saying, go make a friend or man up isn't exactly helpful.

639
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,400
Loneliness is not something to be ashamed of or ignored.

640
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,060
You wouldn't be ashamed to get help for a broken arm.

641
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,360
So if your soul is injured, you should reach out.

642
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,600
Here are six ways that one can combat loneliness.

643
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,680
Number one, reach out.

644
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,600
This could include professional help

645
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,120
or expressing how you feel to your friends or family.

646
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,000
You can just start small.

647
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,720
You could also find local groups, organizations,

648
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,640
and services that can help you connect with others.

649
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,520
Reach out to a mental health professional

650
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,040
like a therapist or counselor.

651
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,240
They can provide you with guidance and support

652
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,840
to address the underlying causes of loneliness.

653
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,180
Number two, self-acceptance.

654
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,740
This seems counterintuitive, but another solution

655
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,780
is to cultivate a connection with oneself.

656
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,260
It's a practice to remind us

657
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,540
that we do indeed have self-worth.

658
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,700
A 2022 study showed that self-reflection

659
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,420
can reduce feelings of loneliness

660
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,860
and also contribute to finding meaning in life.

661
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,060
Reflecting on who you are, practicing self-compassion,

662
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,480
and writing down how you're feeling can be a great start.

663
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,400
Number three, gratitude.

664
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,640
A lot of things around us tell us that we're not enough.

665
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,360
It's how a lot of companies make their money.

666
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,840
The advertising tells us we're not rich enough

667
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,800
or pretty enough.

668
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,080
Although if we just buy this one more thing, we'll be happy.

669
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,040
We can combat this by being grateful

670
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,280
in what we do have, the practice of gratitude.

671
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,680
I know it sounds trite,

672
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,480
but the simple practice of gratitude can do wonders.

673
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,580
A 2021 study showed that increased gratitude

674
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,640
can reduce feelings of loneliness.

675
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:29,880
A 2015 study, 2011 study, and 2010 study

676
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,920
all showed the same thing.

677
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,440
For just five minutes a day,

678
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,800
really think about what you can be thankful for.

679
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
At first, it may seem like there's nothing

680
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,600
to be thankful for, but if you're not forced

681
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,320
to fight in a war, have a roof over your head

682
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,080
and are in decent physical health, have food,

683
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,760
and have water, that's better than some people.

684
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,320
We should be thankful for that and much more.

685
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,020
There's nothing wrong with acknowledging

686
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,460
that where you are right now is hard, really, really hard,

687
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,620
but incorporating the practice of gratitude

688
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,940
alongside other support can strongly aid in your journey.

689
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,580
For example, studies prove that gratitude

690
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,260
can increase happiness, reduce depression,

691
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,960
and strengthen resiliency.

692
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,100
Grateful people often experience reduced blood pressure,

693
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:20,320
less chronic pain, increased energy, even longer lives.

694
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,680
People who purposefully express more gratitude

695
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,200
report higher self-esteem than those who don't,

696
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,400
and they're more likely to help others.

697
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,000
A pro-social behavior also linked to greater happiness.

698
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,360
People who capture grateful thoughts before bed

699
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,800
sleep better than those who don't.

700
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,920
Why so many positive changes?

701
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,720
Because gratitude actually rewires our brains,

702
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,320
kickstarting the production of dopamine and serotonin.

703
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,520
Like antidepressants, these feel-good neurotransmitters

704
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,680
activate the bliss center of the brain,

705
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,600
creating feelings of happiness and contentment.

706
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,040
This appears to be self-perpetuating.

707
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,520
Research suggests that with regular practice,

708
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,560
you'll train your prefrontal cortex to better appreciate

709
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,120
and retain positive experiences and thoughts,

710
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,920
and to deflect the negative ones.

711
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,320
Number four, social media reduction.

712
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,200
When it comes to using social media,

713
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,520
we need to use it in moderation.

714
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,840
There's research that says that a small amount

715
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,600
of social media is beneficial,

716
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,800
but a large amount is detrimental.

717
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,200
30 minutes of use a day is the advice

718
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,520
from Dr. Jeremy Noble.

719
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,760
He cited a University of Pennsylvania study.

720
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,600
Cutting back on social media can significantly improve

721
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,120
your wellbeing.

722
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,560
Dr. Noble also advises to choose social media platforms

723
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:40,040
that help us develop authentic social connections.

724
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,000
Number five, giving to others.

725
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,160
Giving to others shows us that we have something

726
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,400
to offer to the world.

727
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Ironically, this can help us feel less lonely,

728
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,840
local community volunteering,

729
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,720
or just helping a work colleague or neighbor in small ways.

730
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,080
According to Vivek Murphy,

731
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,320
the man who first declared the loneliness pandemic

732
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,480
back in 2017,

733
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,560
quote, service is one of the most under-recognized

734
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,120
antidotes to loneliness.

735
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,760
It reaffirms to ourselves that we have value

736
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,800
to add to the world.

737
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,120
And lastly, number six, connection.

738
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,880
Loneliness is a stress state

739
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
that makes us focus on ourselves

740
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,080
rather than outwards towards others.

741
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,200
To keep safe, we often treat people and things

742
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,520
with suspicion when we feel lonely.

743
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,040
This can ruin self-esteem.

744
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,640
We feel like we're not lovable or likeable.

745
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,640
These factors compound on each other,

746
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,920
making it hard to solve and creating a downward spiral.

747
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,440
To break the cycle, one can start slowly.

748
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,160
Even a quick hello to your neighbors

749
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,560
can help inch connection forwards.

750
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,480
And lastly, if you're fortunate

751
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,960
to have a healthy group of friends,

752
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,840
try and schedule calls together,

753
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,520
talk to each other and just chat about life.

754
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,960
There's an old Japanese tradition from Okinawa called Moe.

755
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,280
It basically means lifelong group of friends.

756
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,680
They meet weekly and talk about life,

757
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,200
discuss issues and help each other.

758
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,120
Elders in Okinawa live extraordinarily better

759
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,280
and longer lives than almost anyone

760
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,960
anywhere else in the world.

761
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,600
It's common to find Moe groups

762
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,960
that have been friends for over 90 years.

763
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,360
Why I've traveled to the Japanese archipelago of Okinawa,

764
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,720
where there are more centenarians

765
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,640
than anywhere else in the world.

766
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

767
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

768
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

769
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

770
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

771
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

772
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

773
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

774
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

775
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

776
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

777
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

778
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

779
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

780
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,960
I was born and raised in Okinawa.

781
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
I don't try to live as long as possible.

782
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,200
It happens naturally because we all gather laugh and cry together and that's what's good. That's what we say

783
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,840
That's it. That's really the way of life in Okinawa

784
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,080
Keep in mind that these are general rules and some may find it harder to make connections than others due to being non-neurotypical

785
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:03,040
Or due to other circumstances within their lives

786
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,600
Sometimes people that you try to connect with can just be plain rude

787
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,000
But at the end of the day there are many ways to combat loneliness

788
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,800
So the key is to realize how you're feeling and to find the best strategy for you alongside professional help

789
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,320
If you encounter someone showing symptoms of loneliness, don't ignore them reach out to people who might be lonely

790
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,320
Talk to them. If they need professional help guide them in the right direction. It all comes down to how can you be of service to others?

791
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,320
The gift of simply being there and truly listening can sometimes go a long way

792
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,640
Go in with an open mind. Don't be quick to judge and try and practice understanding

793
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,960
Once we listen to others, they can be more open to listening to us

794
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:54,720
Chronic loneliness is an unnatural condition a state that we were not designed for it leaves us empty and longing for connection and understanding

795
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,480
It's been slowly building since industrialization

796
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,880
Accelerating in the 1960s and 70s before exploding in the 21st century

797
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,080
It crept in and snuck up on us and only with the proliferation of smartphones and COVID

798
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,600
Did it get so severe that it could no longer be ignored only now?

799
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,040
Are we starting to see and do we care about the impact of loneliness before it gets out of hand?

800
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,640
We need to tackle the situation

801
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,440
Of course

802
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:26,720
You can't alleviate everyone's loneliness as each person longs for different types and different depths of connection

803
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:34,720
But as it poses a public health concern on a global level both government sectors and private health organizations need to be more vigilant

804
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,040
Confronting loneliness is not an impossible task, but it is going to take some work

805
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,960
It requires a genuine demonstration of care and compassion for oneself and others

806
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:49,760
As mentioned this episode was many months in the making

807
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,720
So I hope that I could shed some light on the modern origins of loneliness the causes and the solutions

808
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Although the chatter amongst strangers may have gone in many public spaces. Hopefully the chatter on our streets will return one day

809
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,800
So what are your thoughts on this epidemic level of loneliness? Have you personally been affected by it?

810
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,560
What's your story? Do you know someone else that's going through loneliness?
