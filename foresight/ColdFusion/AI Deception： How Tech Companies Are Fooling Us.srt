This video is brought to you by Aura.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,440
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,240
In 1770, Hungarian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kemplen

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,360
built an unveiled a self-operating chess-playing machine called the Mechanical Turk.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,440
In demonstrations around Europe, his chess-playing invention won most of its games against actual human chess players

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,240
and it's even said that it went on to beat players like Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin.

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,160
Naturally, the invention was extremely popular, a marvel of its day.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
However, it was actually just some guy under the table secretly operating the machine.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,800
In other words, it was a hoax.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,320
Some 250 years later, in 2016, Amazon pulled a similar stunt.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,920
Their checkout system, called Just Walk Out, allowed customers to simply grab items from the store and leave.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,120
Under this system, customers didn't have to manually scan their items at the checkout.

13
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,240
The transactions and logistics were automatically taken care of behind the scenes by AI.

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,800
An elegant combination of computer vision, sense of fusion, and deep learning.

15
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,440
Or was it?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,440
Just like the Mechanical Turk, all was not as it seemed.

17
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,560
Amazon's so-called AI technology was actually powered by a thousand people in India

18
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,760
watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts.

19
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,040
Now, human's labeling data is often how AI models are first trained and that's fine.

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,680
But the point is, the advertising was misleading.

21
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Even by 2022, these 1,000 people were still manually reviewing 70% of transactions

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,400
in 20 Amazon Go stores, 40 Amazon Fresh Grocery stores, and two Whole Foods stores.

23
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,040
Although some saw it as dystopian, Amazon promoted their Just Walk Out technology

24
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,240
as a utopian magical solution powered by AI.

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,920
And herein lies the problem.

26
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,280
Companies often leave out critical information in the fine print.

27
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,400
It wasn't until 2023 that Amazon mentioned the use of the 1,000 people in India.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,600
And it gets worse.

29
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
According to a report by the information, other companies were swindled too.

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,600
Quote, 30 stores operated by other companies in the US, sports stadiums, 12 airports,

31
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,040
and one university all used Amazon's Walk Out technology.

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,080
And this is where things become murky.

33
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,000
When companies promise revolutionary technology, but don't follow up on them,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,200
it creates distrust, but it can even spoil it for those who are doing legitimate work in the field.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,400
With the AI revolution that we've seen over the past couple of years,

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,680
there needs to be a more critical look at what's happening with AI.

37
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,840
In this episode, we'll see the reasons for the AI hype and its consequences.

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,480
We'll look at if there is indeed an AI bubble and what real-world impact that might be having.

39
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,440
This includes companies releasing half-baked AI products,

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
but also simultaneously replacing actual humans with AI.

41
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,200
It's a dichotomy of an industry, so sit back and relax as we make sense of it all.

42
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,960
One use of AI technology that absolutely nobody is thrilled about

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,520
is the fact that it can make scammers' lives easier.

44
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,920
AI can help generate convincing texts that try to trick you into clicking a phishing link.

45
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,640
And then there's the spam emails and robocalls.

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,120
You've all experienced it, but why does it happen?

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,840
It's because your information has been sold to data brokers.

48
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,920
They're making a fortune from selling your information to robocallers and scammers.

49
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,320
They can know a lot about you, including your name, phone number, and address.

50
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,480
But there's a simple way to stop this. That's where today's sponsor, Aura, comes in.

51
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,040
They can identify data brokers and submit opt-out requests on your behalf.

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,640
Brokers are legally required to remove your information if you ask them to,

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
but they make it super hard to do.

54
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,080
Let Aura handle that for you.

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,880
Aura also does so much more to protect you and your family from online threats that you can't see.

56
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,480
It's really easy to set up, so you don't have to download several different apps

57
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,520
to get things like parental controls, antivirus, a VPN, password management,

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,520
identity theft insurance, and more.

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,760
And you get everything at one affordable price.

Okay, so let's continue.

63
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,880
No, it's not just you.

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,080
The term AI is really being thrown around everywhere.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,040
For older Cold Fusion viewers, you'd know that I've been covering AI for the good part of a decade now.

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,520
Before 2022, the word artificial intelligence was limited to industry verbiage and obscure research papers.

67
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,240
The general public didn't know or care.

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,640
And even as late as 2021 when I covered GPT-3, there was a lot of people that thought I was just making it up.

69
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,360
How could a computer possibly talk like that?

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,640
Well, as you all know, after 2022, especially following the launch of chat GPT,

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,760
it was a different story.

72
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
From your smartphone to LinkedIn to your local government site,

73
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,760
a lot of organizations today will boast the term powered by AI.

74
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,800
While in a lot of cases it makes sense, the overuse of the term

75
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,520
and it being thrown around so casually is a symptom of something called AI washing.

76
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,200
AI washing, simply put, is when companies create a fake buzz and mislead investors by

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,280
providing manipulative information about the capabilities, limitations, or risks of their AI products,

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,960
or simply wholesale lie about how and when they're using AI.

79
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:24,640
According to Goldman Sachs, a record 36% of S&P 500 companies mentioned AI in their Q4 earnings reports.

80
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,840
If the biggest companies in the world are hyping it up, there's no doubt that smaller companies are following suit

81
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,680
and some without tangible results backing up their claims.

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
And the investments are there to match too.

83
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,680
From 2015 to 2022, global corporate AI investments have increased seven times.

84
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,000
A lot of companies have seen tremendous growth in the recent AI hype,

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
and this puts pressure on other companies to integrate AI into their business model

86
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,440
or their products in order to compete.

87
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,760
And that's even if it's not really AI.

88
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,440
Monkey see, monkey do.

89
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,800
For example, the Canadian investment firm, Delphia, claimed that it had built an AI to

90
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,160
predict upcoming companies and industry trends, despite not having any such capabilities.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,600
The SEC caught wind of the scam and has since ordered them to pay US$225,000,

92
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
and this was for false advertising and misleading statements about the use of AI.

93
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,120
And I have a feeling that this is just the start.

94
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,960
I previously talked about the Wirecard fraud, where CEO Marcus Braun boasted about having

95
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,800
advanced proprietary AI throughout their fintech products and services.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,680
In reality, it was just spreadsheets.

97
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,480
In the end, there was $2 billion missing from the books,

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,400
but that was a story for a different day.

99
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
You might have also heard about the NPU, or Neural Processing Unit.

100
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,280
It's a dedicated processor specifically designed for AI tasks, among other things.

101
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,680
They're becoming increasingly common in the world of PCs and laptops,

102
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,400
and Microsoft has even claimed that we're now in the age of the AI PC,

103
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,720
but recent reviews of the current crop of these products have left consumers with a bad taste

104
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,520
in their mouth.

105
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,520
Let's talk a bit more about AI.

106
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,560
Yes, the Snapdragon processors dominate here, but AI is still very nascent.

107
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,280
Many people either won't use these tasks or that much,

108
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,480
or these tasks themselves just don't work that well yet.

109
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,520
For example, they demoed generating images of animals,

110
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,720
and they highlighted how fast the processors were versus Intel.

111
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,640
But when I looked closely at the images generated, they were all garbage.

112
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,360
The AI dogs all had very lopsided eyes.

113
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,640
So who cares if one of these processors is faster than the other

114
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
if they are both generating garbage?

115
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,040
Right now, I just wouldn't advise anyone buy a laptop based on its AI capabilities.

116
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:37,280
A news analyst from Computerworld has mentioned that these AI PCs

117
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,440
aren't, quote, all they're cracked up to be.

118
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,280
And if you're expecting something transformative when you buy one from the start of 2024,

119
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,640
you're going to be disappointed.

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,960
They might one day deliver a lot of cool features, just not yet, end quote.

121
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,000
But are there consequences of such misplaced promises,

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,080
other than distrust from customers?

123
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,240
Companies that missed the mark with AI product launches are constantly trying to save face.

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
Even the most popular companies in the world are not immune to mistakes.

125
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,640
Perhaps the biggest consequence of AI washing is a certain B word

126
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
that might be lurking around the corner.

127
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,440
Almost as soon as AI started going Uber mainstream from late 2022,

128
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,280
a lot of people immediately likened the phenomenon to the dot-com bubble

129
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
or even the crypto fiasco.

130
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,200
In fact, some people still do today.

131
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,840
Even when we talk about the dot-com bubble,

132
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,000
it's not the world wide web that was the problem.

133
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,160
Because of course, you're using it right now.

134
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,920
Instead, it was mostly the e-commerce side of things which overpromised,

135
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:37,200
reeling in investors but under delivered, leading to a crash

136
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,040
when everyone realized that the companies that they invested in weren't making any money.

137
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,800
With AI, there's no doubt that we'll see some more investment in the space

138
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
and monumental growth too.

139
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,600
According to Oppenheimer, no, not the one you're thinking of,

140
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,880
who's a chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research,

141
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,320
we believe we are in the relatively early stages of a new technology cycle

142
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
that is likely to lead to further outperformance.

143
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,200
Nvidia, who designs the chips that are powering Big Tech's AI revolution,

144
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
is tentative proof of this.

145
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Their stock is up 80% this year alone, perhaps excessive,

146
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,200
but it's indicative of what the market thinks of AI.

147
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Mark Cuban, who made his fortune during the dot-com era,

148
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,720
also doesn't see AI as a bubble.

149
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,560
In a recent interview with Lex Friedman,

150
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
he expressed that the biggest sign that we're not in a bubble

151
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,280
is the lack of IPOs in the AI sector.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,680
Also, the absence of companies with no intrinsic value going public

153
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,520
and the lack of, quote, funky AI companies is a key indicator.

154
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,200
He noted that the current market doesn't exhibit such characteristics,

155
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
and I think that I largely agree with that.

156
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,680
There's obviously some bad players in the industry

157
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,520
who are just trying to make a quick buck,

158
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,160
but there might be more to it, and here's what I mean.

159
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
There's a known pattern for emerging technologies

160
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,160
called the Gartner hype cycle.

161
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,560
It describes how humans tend to be overzealous

162
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,880
about a new revolutionary technology.

163
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,440
We overestimate and overshoot its impact,

164
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
hype it up until the market crashes,

165
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,680
and after the crash, the real companies with the real value

166
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,960
come through and spearhead the development of the new technology

167
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,160
until it's mature.

168
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,720
If we look at the Gartner hype cycle for AI,

169
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
it seems like we're at the closing stages

170
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,040
of the peak of inflated expectations

171
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,840
and are slowly entering the trough of disillusionment.

172
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,920
This interpretation of the current market

173
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,320
means that there's going to be a lot of disappointment ahead.

174
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,480
The real applications of AI will come after the hype and fatigue fades.

175
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,040
But this time could be a little bit different

176
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,280
because at its core, AI has the ability to mimic cognitive labour,

177
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,400
a change that no previous technology has been able to do

178
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,160
without intrinsic human intervention.

179
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,320
Whereas, as pointed out in a previous podcast episode,

180
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
during the dot-com bubble, there were a lot of people

181
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,120
simply making a random website and going public

182
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
and investors would throw money at anything

183
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,800
with a dot-com at the end of its name.

184
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
There's been a lot of organisations

185
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,800
that have been rushing to launch AI products

186
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
or replace humans with AI altogether.

187
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
But the ones who are hastily adding the ever-popular,

188
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,960
quote, powered by AI, gimmick, are failing badly

189
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,760
and there have been some spectacular AI failures.

190
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,040
For example, a parcel delivery firm called DPD

191
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,760
enabled an AI online chat for answering questions.

192
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,640
For one customer, it was not only useless

193
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,040
at answering relevant questions regarding his order,

194
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,200
but instead, when asked, it provided him with a poem and swore at him.

195
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,400
This amazing poem came forth about a DPD chat pot.

196
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,600
Who wasn't able to do anything? It was quite amazing.

197
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,080
It appeared to even disregard its own rules

198
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,680
and started swearing and even started dissing its own employer,

199
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,360
adding, DPD is the worst delivery firm in the world.

200
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,520
I would never recommend them to anyone.

201
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,240
In Australia, a group of academics used AI-generated material

202
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,680
as part of their complaint submission

203
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,880
to the Australian Parliament against four of Australia's biggest banks.

204
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,400
Of course, the AI made up a whole bunch of information,

205
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,480
including scandals that never existed

206
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,160
and implicating Deloitte when they had nothing to do with the original complaint.

207
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,320
Someone on the team didn't read the entire submission

208
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,920
before it went to the Australian Government,

209
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
so it was a huge embarrassment

210
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
and the academics were forced to apologise.

211
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,600
This is just one of many examples

212
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,120
and I'm going to include a website

213
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,200
that keeps a running tab of these AI blunders.

214
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,320
But on the other hand, there are companies

215
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,400
who are integrating AI successfully.

216
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,080
And this is where we come to the other kind of broken promise

217
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,360
when it comes to AI.

218
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,240
It's not CEO's over-promising AI's usefulness,

219
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,600
but under-promising instead.

220
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,440
In other words, we were told that AI would be our assistance

221
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,520
and create new jobs, not replace us.

222
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,440
But what if that's just not true?

223
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Not about replacing the human in the loop.

224
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,040
In fact, it's about empowering the human.

225
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
It's an assistant.

226
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,560
It's an assistant.

227
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,120
This clip from Satya is a bit hard to believe now,

228
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
even though later he did mention the flip side.

229
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,800
Yes, I'm sure a lot of us use ChatGPT

230
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
to help get work done on personal projects,

231
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
but AI eventually creating more jobs than it would replace.

232
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
Maybe not so fast.

233
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,280
You may have noticed that since 2022,

234
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,600
there's been a lot of tech-related layoffs.

235
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
The narrative is that this is happening

236
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,080
due to the over-hiring during the pandemic times.

237
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,440
And that would make sense for 2022 and even 2023,

238
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,640
but in 2024, we're still seeing mass layoffs.

239
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,680
Now, if companies were just struggling to make a profit,

240
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,040
the explanation would be as simple as the common business cycle.

241
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,920
But strangely, some of the biggest companies in the world

242
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,280
are seeing record profits.

243
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,200
They're almost cyclically shedding workers.

244
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,000
According to reports,

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,320
tech companies fired 165,000 people in 2022, 260,000 in 2023,

246
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,960
and so far, the projection is 270,000 in 2024.

247
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,720
So if companies are doing fine,

248
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,120
why are workers being kicked out the door?

249
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,400
Well, marketing professor and author Scott Galloway thinks,

250
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,680
quote, there's something else going on, end quote.

251
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
In his recent blog post dissecting the impact of AI

252
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,440
on corporations, he mentions, quote,

253
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
AI is playing a larger role in layoffs

254
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,400
than CEOs are willing to admit, end quote.

255
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,760
The normal way we think about job replacements caused by AI

256
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,080
is that Joe Blogs is working at his computer,

257
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,320
analyzing company figures or something like that.

258
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,360
And then suddenly, the next day, he's replaced by an AI.

259
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,000
But the truth is, it's a bit more nuanced than that.

260
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
As companies slowly get better at understanding

261
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,680
how AI can aid in their operations,

262
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,640
they'll create better teams and structure with higher outcomes.

263
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,400
Basically, instead of three people doing the work of three,

264
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,440
you'll have one person doing the work of five with AI.

265
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,000
The problem is that none of these companies

266
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,200
are being sincere about it.

267
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
Because if you're a CEO and you've been hyping up AI

268
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,960
as the single greatest thing to happen to the industry,

269
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,480
and then you follow it up with a memo

270
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,040
that you've laid off 30% of your staff because of AI,

271
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,720
the hypocrisy becomes clear.

272
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,640
But in 2024, it seems like the truth is slowly coming out.

273
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,240
And there's hints everywhere.

274
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
IBM made headlines when CEO, Arvind Krishna,

275
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,440
mentioned that they're planning to pause hiring roles

276
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,280
that could be replaced with AI.

277
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,960
Same with UPS, where recently their CEO, Carol Tom,

278
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,080
acknowledged that AI is playing a part in employee layoffs.

279
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,880
And this came after UPS had the largest layoff

280
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,640
in its 116-year history, 12,000 workers.

281
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
In both cases, spokespeople later clarified saying,

282
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,400
quote, AI is not replacing workers, end quote,

283
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,120
which is basically PR talk to save face.

284
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
In fact, a Shopify employee

285
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,800
broke their nondisclosure agreement

286
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,240
to expose that the company has been secretly firing employees

287
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,280
because of AI.

288
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,880
The shift is even having an impact far outside the tech industry.

289
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,200
TV and media producer Tyler Perry

290
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,000
was building an $800 million studio expansion

291
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,640
but paused its construction after he saw the results

292
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,920
of open AISsora, an AI video generator.

293
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,760
He made the remark, quote,

294
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,480
I am very, very concerned that in the near future,

295
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,200
a lot of jobs are going to be lost, end quote.

296
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,520
In the last couple of years,

297
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
you probably would have heard this phrase a bit.

298
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,360
AI will not replace humans,

299
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,320
but humans who utilize AI will replace humans who don't.

300
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,320
There's definitely some truth to it,

301
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,960
but some jobs will be at risk regardless.

302
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,160
We don't have to imagine this.

303
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,360
It is already happening.

304
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
Megacaps like Meta and Alphabet,

305
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,880
they are shrinking their workforces

306
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,400
and shrinking their hiring.

307
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,920
It's this idea that senior AI researchers or data analysts,

308
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,760
they can do more with gen AI

309
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,480
than an army of junior engineers who code.

310
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,600
A recent report from McKinsey found that

311
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
around 12 million U.S. workers

312
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,600
may need to switch jobs by 2030.

313
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,360
Lower-wage workers are 14 times more likely to be impacted.

314
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
STEM, healthcare, builders, and professional fields

315
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,160
will continue to add jobs,

316
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,720
but generative AI could change work significantly

317
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,360
for occupations like customer service and sales

318
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,320
and office support.

319
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
There's been repeated reports of how AI

320
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,120
will be adding hundreds of millions of jobs

321
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,080
in the next decade

322
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,320
and how it's going to positively impact GDP.

323
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,200
While by some miracle, this could happen.

324
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,160
Right now, as has been the case many times in history,

325
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,560
the train will leave the station without telling us.

326
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:09,360
Whether we're aware to jump on board or not is the question.

327
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,160
So wrapping this all up,

328
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,000
I do have to mention that in no way

329
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
am I saying that all forms of AI

330
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,120
and all of these giant corporations are elaborate hoaxes.

331
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,640
In fact, on this channel,

332
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
I've been making videos about AI progress

333
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,400
for the better part of a decade now,

334
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,520
and I've seen exponential progress right in front of my eyes,

335
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,880
and so will many of you.

336
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
We may have hit a temporary bottleneck

337
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,520
when it comes to compute,

338
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,240
but all it takes is a breakthrough in model efficiency

339
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
and the curve continues upwards.

340
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,040
But I just think that it's important

341
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
to still have a cautious approach

342
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,640
when it comes to looking at all sides of a story.

343
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,640
I'm also working on a video

344
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,680
that's all about the positive real-life impacts of AI,

345
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,600
so hopefully that's going to balance things out a bit.

346
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,360
So far, it seems like the promises of AI

347
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,880
are yet to be fully realized.

348
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,600
Whether that's creating and not taking jobs,

349
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,040
solving global issues,

350
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,240
or even providing us with a dependable AI customer service spot

351
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,520
that doesn't swear at us.

352
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,280
With such big and bold promises

353
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,040
from these companies over the years,

354
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,280
it's important for all of us to ask ourselves,

355
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
do we have technological gold,

356
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,560
a Trojan horse,

357
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,880
or a chess master hiding under a table?

358
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
Anyways, that's about it from me.

359
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,760
My name is DeGogo,

360
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,360
and you've been watching Cold Fusion.

361
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,720
If you did like that episode,

362
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,840
feel free to subscribe.

363
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,680
There's plenty of other interesting stuff on the channel.

364
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,000
All right, so I'll catch you again soon.

365
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,200
Cheers, guys.

366
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,480
Have a good one.

367
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Heaven help us make a better future.

368
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,600
A better future.

369
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:50,000
Heaven help us make a better future.

370
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,880
Cold Fusion.

371
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,000
It's missing.
