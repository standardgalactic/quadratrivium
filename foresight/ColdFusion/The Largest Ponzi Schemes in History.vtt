00:00.000 --> 00:08.880
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

00:08.880 --> 00:14.000
With all seen and read reports of Ponty scheme scandals getting exposed, the details always

00:14.000 --> 00:19.000
talk about a significant number of people who have lost their savings in these schemes.

00:19.000 --> 00:24.920
But even after investigations, arrests and sentences, new scammers will pop up and keep

00:24.920 --> 00:28.800
doing the same thing over and over again.

00:28.800 --> 00:32.800
But what exactly is a Ponty scheme and what are the science to look out for and how can

00:32.800 --> 00:34.360
you protect yourself?

00:34.360 --> 00:37.800
And what are the biggest Ponty schemes of all time?

00:37.800 --> 00:41.600
You might be surprised to find out that the US government might be running the biggest

00:41.600 --> 00:45.880
Ponty scheme in history according to some economists, so stay tuned till the end of

00:45.880 --> 00:48.800
the episode to learn about that one.

00:48.800 --> 00:58.080
Let's get into it.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.920
But first of all, what is a Ponty scheme?

01:00.920 --> 01:03.320
A Ponty scheme is an investment fraud.

01:03.320 --> 01:08.360
The scheme promises high and sometimes quick returns, but in reality it's just paying

01:08.360 --> 01:13.680
off existing investors with funds collected from new investors who have also been fooled,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.560
fooled by the promise of a quick buck.

01:16.560 --> 01:21.120
Ponty schemes use money from their new investors to pay off old investors while taking a cut

01:21.120 --> 01:22.920
for themselves.

01:22.920 --> 01:27.600
Since there is no money being earned by selling a product or a service, Ponty schemes require

01:27.640 --> 01:30.640
a constant flow of new money to sustain.

01:30.640 --> 01:35.960
Not surprisingly, after a time, it becomes increasingly harder to find new investors,

01:35.960 --> 01:42.000
and when that happens, the scheme fails.

01:42.000 --> 01:45.560
A Ponty scheme is not to be confused with a pyramid scheme.

01:45.560 --> 01:50.440
A pyramid scheme requires recruitment to bring in more people to increase their returns.

01:50.440 --> 01:53.560
A Ponty scheme may or may not need that.

01:53.560 --> 01:58.600
For example, a Ponty scheme would be something like BitConnect, a fake cryptocurrency that

01:58.600 --> 02:03.760
promised huge returns from a mysterious AI trading algorithm, but in reality, it used

02:03.760 --> 02:07.080
money from old investors to pay off new investors.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.960
And let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.960
The world is not anymore the way it used to be.

02:14.960 --> 02:17.960
No, no, no.

02:18.360 --> 02:22.360
BitConnect!

02:22.360 --> 02:24.360
Wow!

02:24.360 --> 02:29.760
Thousands of victims swindled out of more than $2 billion may be receiving some justice

02:29.760 --> 02:32.960
after one of the leaders of a crypto scheme pleaded guilty.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.440
This is believed to be the biggest cryptocurrency fraud ever charged criminal.

02:36.440 --> 02:40.560
He says this scam, run through a crypto lending program called BitConnect, is believed to

02:40.560 --> 02:45.120
have swindled thousands of people around the world out of more than $2 billion worth

02:45.120 --> 02:46.280
of Bitcoin.

02:46.280 --> 02:50.320
They claimed that if you traded your Bitcoin for their cryptocurrency, crypto currency

02:50.320 --> 02:55.160
called the BitConnect coin, that a trading bot would make sure that you didn't lose

02:55.160 --> 02:56.160
any money.

02:56.160 --> 03:01.600
Also, offering investors returns as high as 40% per month, but prosecutors say BitConnect

03:01.600 --> 03:06.720
actually operated like a Ponzi scheme, using investor funds to repay other BitConnect

03:06.720 --> 03:07.720
investors.

03:07.720 --> 03:12.200
A pyramid scheme, on the other hand, relies heavily on recruiting.

03:12.200 --> 03:16.160
So something like Metabolife, where members would sell supplements and take a cut of the

03:16.160 --> 03:19.920
sales of those who they recruited, forming a pyramid.

03:19.920 --> 03:25.560
Now, have you ever wondered why an unusual word like Ponzi is associated with financial

03:25.560 --> 03:26.560
fraud?

03:26.560 --> 03:33.360
Its name is as such, because it's named after a man named Charles Ponzi.

03:33.360 --> 03:35.560
So who was Charles Ponzi?

03:35.560 --> 03:41.680
Charles Ponzi was a swindler, known for starting a scheme of this kind in 1920 in Boston.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.440
Charles Ponzi was born in 1882 in Italy.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.400
As a young boy, he kept stealing from the church so much that his family got sick of

03:49.400 --> 03:52.720
him and deported him to America in 1903.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.080
Charles worked in a restaurant as a waiter, but continually shortchanged the customers,

03:57.080 --> 04:00.520
keeping the difference so he was fired.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.080
In 1907, he moved to Canada and because of his skills with numbers, he got employed at

04:05.080 --> 04:06.080
a bank.

04:06.080 --> 04:10.040
Here, he would forge the signatures of clients and cash their checks.

04:10.040 --> 04:13.400
He was caught and spent three years in prison.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.600
After his release, Charles went back to the US and started up a scheme to smuggle Italian

04:17.600 --> 04:19.920
immigrants from Canada to the US.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.520
Again, he was caught and jailed for two years.

04:23.520 --> 04:28.480
This time when he got out, he went to Boston and in November of 1919, he came across the

04:28.480 --> 04:30.720
idea for his grand scheme.

04:30.720 --> 04:36.440
Supposedly, this was achieved by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and

04:36.440 --> 04:41.600
redeeming them at face value in the US where the currency was much stronger.

04:41.600 --> 04:50.280
He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days.

04:50.280 --> 04:56.960
In 1907, an international postal congress had agreed to issue postal reply coupons throughout

04:56.960 --> 04:59.080
the world.

04:59.080 --> 05:04.280
The bearers could redeem these international coupons for postage stamps in their local

05:04.280 --> 05:06.360
country.

05:06.360 --> 05:08.440
This was to address a real problem.

05:08.440 --> 05:13.240
Immigrants who came to America could afford to buy stamps, the relatives who stayed home

05:13.240 --> 05:14.240
could not.

05:14.240 --> 05:19.960
This was a way to allow relatives back home to write back to the family in America.

05:19.960 --> 05:25.520
If you went to a European post office with American dollars and bought postal reply

05:25.520 --> 05:31.240
coupons and then brought them to this country and cashed them in, you got US postage many

05:31.240 --> 05:36.120
times more valuable than the US money you spent for them.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.400
This was the premise.

05:38.400 --> 05:44.200
Ponzi believed that for every dollar of postal reply coupons purchased, he could earn $5 when

05:44.200 --> 05:46.760
he redeemed them for stamps.

05:46.760 --> 05:52.800
With a 400% profit from these initial purchases, Ponzi would buy additional coupons and redeem

05:52.800 --> 05:55.360
them for even more money.

05:55.360 --> 05:58.920
It seemed to be a proposition that couldn't lose.

05:58.920 --> 06:03.160
The only issue with this plan was that Ponzi would need to employ people to line up and

06:03.160 --> 06:08.000
collect coupons and stamps, gather them up and ship them overseas, so this would probably

06:08.000 --> 06:11.360
cost more than the money generated from the scheme itself.

06:11.360 --> 06:16.720
So Charles Ponzi decided to buy no coupon stamps at all and just tell people that the

06:16.720 --> 06:18.440
scheme would make them rich.

06:18.440 --> 06:21.520
Double your money in three months.

06:21.520 --> 06:27.160
America was booming in 1920, so people were all looking for a quick way to get rich.

06:27.160 --> 06:31.760
Wild financial speculation was all the rage, so Ponzi fit right in.

06:31.760 --> 06:36.200
He was charismatic and had a gift for talking, so everyone wanted a piece of the pie and

06:36.200 --> 06:38.360
word quickly spread around.

06:38.360 --> 06:42.480
Some people would take out their life savings from a bank to invest with Ponzi.

06:42.480 --> 06:47.920
But the thing was, Ponzi would actually pay back investors as promised, so the whole thing

06:47.920 --> 06:51.040
seemed legitimate and people went crazy.

06:51.040 --> 06:57.680
By March of 1920, investors had thrown in $400,000, but Ponzi owed them $600,000 because of the

06:57.680 --> 06:59.760
promises of his scheme.

06:59.760 --> 07:03.560
Most people trusted him so much that they kept their money in so they could earn even

07:03.560 --> 07:04.560
more.

07:04.560 --> 07:09.080
Because of this, Charles could always make the payments when they came due.

07:09.080 --> 07:15.560
Two months later in May, investors had thrown in $1.6 million, and by July, this had swelled

07:15.560 --> 07:22.200
to $41 million, but at this stage, Charles owed $55 million, and that was the problem.

07:22.200 --> 07:26.560
The more money Charles Ponzi received, the more in debt he was.

07:26.560 --> 07:31.200
If he promised to double everyone's money, he would just be owing more and more.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.120
All of this didn't matter though, as long as everyone didn't want their money out

07:34.120 --> 07:35.720
at once.

07:35.720 --> 07:40.720
Soon, Ponzi was averaging $3.4 million a day.

07:40.720 --> 07:46.280
He bought himself a $7 million home with a heated pool and air conditioning, absolutely

07:46.280 --> 07:48.920
unheard of in 1920.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.720
He bought the very same shipping firm when he smuggled Italian immigrants just so he

07:52.720 --> 07:55.080
could fire his old boss.

07:55.080 --> 07:59.600
Six months ago, he was broke, but now he could have anything he wanted.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.400
Massive crowds were growing outside of Ponzi's office, and officials got suspicious.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.840
Police were called in to investigate, but after they talked to Charles Ponzi, two of

08:07.840 --> 08:10.200
the three officers ended up investing.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.640
In fact, a quarter of Boston's police force were investing with Charles Ponzi.

08:15.640 --> 08:20.760
On the 26th of July, a Boston newspaper ran the first critical story of Ponzi.

08:20.760 --> 08:26.280
It stated, if Ponzi could make 300% profit for his investors, why does he put his money

08:26.280 --> 08:29.320
in the bank where it would only make him 2% or 3%?

08:29.320 --> 08:32.080
Why not just invest all the money with himself?

08:32.080 --> 08:34.880
It was a good point.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.800
And another article stated that the numbers didn't add up.

08:37.800 --> 08:42.480
There would have to be 160 million of these coupons circulating to amass such profits,

08:42.480 --> 08:47.320
but in reality, there's only about 27,000 of these in the world, and there was also

08:47.320 --> 08:51.000
no reports of massive purchases of coupons.

08:51.000 --> 08:55.840
When these news articles broke, there was a massive panic, a riot ensued at Ponzi's

08:55.840 --> 08:56.840
office.

08:56.840 --> 09:02.640
$27 million were withdrawn in two days, but Ponzi could afford to pay everyone back,

09:02.640 --> 09:07.880
and he did it with a smile while serving people coffee and donuts as they lined up.

09:07.880 --> 09:11.920
Nerves were calmed, and people actually reinvested.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.600
But it wouldn't last.

09:13.600 --> 09:16.840
Government regulators and more bad press came Ponzi's way.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.840
The latter of which stated he was completely bankrupt.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.920
It started another panic and a rush for people to get all of their money out.

09:24.920 --> 09:30.600
Over $200 million had been invested, but Ponzi was short $110 million.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.600
Everyone tried to get their money out at once, and he couldn't pay.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.520
By August of 1920, he was all over.

09:38.520 --> 09:43.040
Ponzi wasn't dieted on 86 counts of fraud, and many investors lost everything.

09:43.840 --> 09:48.080
It was a massive lesson for them, and us, to never just follow the crowd, and always

09:48.080 --> 09:49.920
do your research before investing.

09:53.920 --> 09:58.600
Even though Charles Ponzi got convicted and jailed for his deceit, it did not deter others

09:58.600 --> 10:00.760
from coming up with such schemes.

10:00.760 --> 10:05.040
So why do people keep falling for it?

10:05.040 --> 10:08.520
Almost everyone wants to earn easy money, and get rich.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.280
In the real world, this usually means that you need to work hard for it, but it's a

10:12.280 --> 10:14.920
human tendency to look for shortcuts.

10:14.920 --> 10:20.280
But taking shortcuts often leads to trouble, as is with the case with Ponzi schemes.

10:20.280 --> 10:24.640
But it's not necessarily greed that attracts people towards them.

10:24.640 --> 10:28.840
Ponzi schemes are designed in such a way that they appear legitimate.

10:28.840 --> 10:33.120
Investors may genuinely see it as a promising avenue for investment.

10:33.120 --> 10:36.920
Later on in the episode, we'll take a look at some warning signs to watch out for when

10:36.920 --> 10:41.040
deciding if an investment is a Ponzi scheme or not.

10:41.040 --> 10:45.440
The organisers of this kind of fraud usually target those who have spare money, or those

10:45.440 --> 10:49.720
who need money, both are looking for quick and high returns.

10:49.720 --> 10:54.680
Usually, the unemployed, all those coming from a financially weak background, fall prey

10:54.680 --> 10:56.120
to these schemes.

10:56.120 --> 11:01.720
Essentially, it all boils down to how convincingly the Ponzi organiser can fabricate a story,

11:01.720 --> 11:08.640
a story of quick and assured success, playing on the ambitions, dreams, financial situation,

11:08.640 --> 11:10.920
and financial literacy of people.

11:10.920 --> 11:15.560
Emotions can often overthrow logic, so people end up believing that they're being helped

11:15.560 --> 11:19.160
when they're actually being conned.

11:19.160 --> 11:23.560
So let's take a look at five of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history.

11:23.560 --> 11:31.040
Number one, the $593 million fraud by a Minister of Scientology, Reid Slatkin.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.640
Reid Slatkin would start his scheme in 1986.

11:34.640 --> 11:39.160
He would get people, including some very high profile names and many other Scientologists,

11:39.160 --> 11:43.760
to invest in what was an unlicensed, quote, investment club.

11:43.760 --> 11:48.600
He would pay out large sums of money to investors, claiming that his investment were working.

11:48.600 --> 11:53.280
But again, in reality, he was just doing that old method of using new investor funds to

11:53.280 --> 11:55.000
pay off the old investors.

11:55.000 --> 12:01.280
He scammed around 800 investors for more than $593 million across 15 years before being

12:01.280 --> 12:02.280
caught.

12:02.280 --> 12:08.360
He admitted to fraud in 2002 and was jailed for 14 years.

12:09.360 --> 12:13.160
Number two, the $1.2 billion fraud by Scott Rothstein.

12:13.160 --> 12:16.880
Scott Rothstein started inviting investors into his Ponzi scheme.

12:16.880 --> 12:22.080
He claimed to purchase highly confidential legal settlements using his law firm.

12:22.080 --> 12:28.420
Rothstein's legal specialty is suing for sexual harassment, a down and dirty game where defendants

12:28.420 --> 12:33.040
pay big money to settle lawsuits quickly and quietly.

12:33.040 --> 12:36.320
Those are usually paid out over a long period of time.

12:36.320 --> 12:41.480
Rothstein used wealthy investors to pay his clients up front, promising the investors

12:41.480 --> 12:44.120
a big return on their money over time.

12:44.120 --> 12:49.240
In some cases, it was a promise of more than 200%.

12:49.240 --> 12:54.640
I was shown what a confidential settlement agreement looked like, and it had all the

12:54.640 --> 12:56.520
information was blacked out.

12:56.520 --> 13:00.800
It had the name of the plaintiff, the name of the defendant was blacked out, the attorney

13:00.800 --> 13:02.600
was blacked out.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.600
Everyone was blacked out.

13:03.600 --> 13:07.320
If you want to be able to invest in something that couldn't be verified, I didn't even know

13:07.320 --> 13:08.320
if it was real.

13:08.320 --> 13:11.000
In fact, I didn't even think it was real.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.800
The idea is a bonanza attracting big money players like a modern day gold rush.

13:16.800 --> 13:19.160
We three kings be stealing the gold.

13:19.160 --> 13:25.880
Scott ran with movie stars, rock stars, kid rock, Pam Anderson, athletes, superstars,

13:25.880 --> 13:29.120
Dan Marino, Alonzo Morning, Sarah Palin.

13:29.120 --> 13:34.640
There was pictures in his office of him shaking hands with Jeb Bush and George Bush.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.800
From forging documents with judge's signatures to making corrupt law enforcement officers

13:38.800 --> 13:43.520
to do his bidding, Scott often went to great lengths to sustain his fraud.

13:43.520 --> 13:47.800
People in the community were always asking, how are they growing so fast?

13:47.800 --> 13:49.560
Where does that money come from?

13:49.560 --> 13:53.440
And I would always say, I don't know, but not from the practice of law.

13:53.440 --> 13:59.080
We were offered 207% return, and I wanted to see how much money you need to invest to

13:59.080 --> 14:00.080
get rich.

14:00.080 --> 14:10.160
I calculated if you keep in $150,000 for 13 years, that $150,000 turns into $21 trillion.

14:10.160 --> 14:16.120
That's enough to pay off the entire deficit of the United States and have more money beside.

14:16.120 --> 14:18.520
He started off with hundreds of thousands of dollars.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.720
He had to return millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions.

14:21.720 --> 14:25.840
So it had to collapse, there was no way to go forward.

14:25.840 --> 14:29.320
He ran out of funds to pay investors by early 2009.

14:29.320 --> 14:33.840
He raised an extra $100 million investment, but that still wasn't enough to keep the scheme

14:33.840 --> 14:34.840
afloat.

14:34.840 --> 14:39.800
When he knew his time was up, he fled to Morocco, but soon returned to the US, and was arrested

14:39.800 --> 14:40.800
at that point.

14:40.800 --> 14:45.960
Tempers Flare, it's a wrestling match of sorts outside of Florida courtroom, this after Scott

14:45.960 --> 14:50.960
Rothstein, who has ties to Rhode Island, pleads guilty to a billion dollar Ponzi scheme.

14:51.840 --> 14:58.360
He pled guilty in court and was sentenced to 50 years in jail in 2010.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.360
Number 3.

14:59.360 --> 15:02.960
The $3.7 billion fraud by Tom Pettis.

15:02.960 --> 15:08.240
Businessman Thomas J. Pettis was convicted of male fraud, wire fraud, money laundering

15:08.240 --> 15:13.080
and conspiracy for the operation of a $3.7 billion Ponzi scheme.

15:13.080 --> 15:17.520
Thomas convinced investors that by putting money into his organization, they would fund

15:17.600 --> 15:22.880
the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.280
However, no such investments were ever made.

15:26.280 --> 15:30.400
The funds were diverted for other purposes, such as paying off those who helped organize

15:30.400 --> 15:35.320
the fraud and also financing Scott's extravagant lifestyle.

15:35.320 --> 15:39.240
This is how Pettis was able to manage his scheme at PCI.

15:39.240 --> 15:44.360
First you need to ask yourself how to store such as Walmart, Costco, Best Buy and other

15:44.480 --> 15:48.400
big box retailers sell merchandise so cheaply.

15:48.400 --> 15:54.240
One answer is found in a little known industry known as diverting or supply chain management.

15:54.240 --> 15:58.120
In today's market, many retailers do not like to keep a large inventory.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.360
Instead, they buy products as they have a need to sell.

16:01.360 --> 16:04.720
This concept is called just-in-time retailing.

16:04.720 --> 16:08.480
To keep their prices down, they reach out to a middleman.

16:08.480 --> 16:10.720
Pettis was a master diverter.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.200
Here is how his program worked.

16:13.200 --> 16:16.520
He brought on board investors to finance the deals.

16:16.520 --> 16:20.000
Their money was put in a lock box account for safekeeping.

16:20.000 --> 16:24.360
The money was then funneled through a business called Nationwide, where they would buy merchandise

16:24.360 --> 16:30.800
from closeouts or stores going out of business in bulk for low prices.

16:30.800 --> 16:36.720
Eventually they were able to buy large lots of inventory directly from the manufacturer.

16:36.720 --> 16:41.240
Next, the merchandise was shipped to a warehouse where it was held until a deal could be made

16:41.280 --> 16:47.360
where it would be sold at a higher price to a retailer.

16:47.360 --> 16:52.320
The retailers would still save money by not having to maintain such large inventories.

16:52.320 --> 16:57.000
Ultimately, the money from the investment would go back to Nationwide, where they would

16:57.000 --> 17:01.440
take their cut and the investors' money would be put back into the lock box, where they

17:01.440 --> 17:04.000
would get their return on their investment.

17:04.000 --> 17:09.520
This was a very lucrative deal for everyone involved.

17:09.520 --> 17:13.240
The problem was, at some point, Pettis stopped buying merchandise.

17:13.240 --> 17:17.560
The warehouses were empty and nothing was being sold.

17:17.560 --> 17:21.880
All the returns investors were making were coming from the new investors, with Pettis

17:21.880 --> 17:25.680
taking a cut off the top for himself.

17:25.680 --> 17:30.280
The scam was reported to the authorities by one of his co-conspirators in 2008, and he

17:30.280 --> 17:32.520
was arrested soon afterwards.

17:32.520 --> 17:39.400
He was convicted in December of 2009 and was sentenced to 50 years in prison.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.920
The Seven Billion Dollar Fraud by R. Allen Stanford

17:43.920 --> 17:47.680
Allen Stanford was among the wealthiest men in the US.

17:47.680 --> 17:51.760
He built the lavish lifestyle from banking and smooth talk.

17:51.760 --> 17:54.600
But his slick sales pitch turned out to be a lie.

17:54.600 --> 17:59.080
Stanford ran one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in American history.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.040
That isn't until his House of Cards collapsed.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.840
R. Allen Stanford, the chairman of Stanford Financial Group, orchestrated a seven billion

18:06.840 --> 18:12.600
dollar fraud by selling certificates of deposits via his company's offshore bank in Antigua.

18:12.600 --> 18:19.080
He cheated 30,000 investors from a few dozen countries and pocketed some of the proceeds.

18:19.080 --> 18:23.840
He used the money to gamble in business ventures, acquire dubious real estate deals, and even

18:23.840 --> 18:25.880
on cricket tournaments.

18:25.880 --> 18:30.200
He got a little bit friendly with the player's wives and girlfriends.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.360
We can see some pictures of this.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.760
The English player's not particularly pleased.

18:33.760 --> 18:36.960
That's Matt Pry's wife sitting on his knee.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.320
And there was just a little bit of disquietment.

18:40.320 --> 18:45.720
The England players, when they saw the behavior of Sir Allen Stanford with their various wives

18:45.720 --> 18:50.000
and girlfriends, the Daily Mail has picked up on this and has that very picture with the

18:50.000 --> 18:55.960
England player's fury at Stanford's antics with the wags turning into an ego-fueled fuss

18:55.960 --> 18:59.080
saying the players were gobsmacked.

18:59.080 --> 19:00.760
Is it fun being a billionaire?

19:01.160 --> 19:09.560
Well, yes, I have to say it is fun being a billionaire, but it's hard work.

19:09.560 --> 19:14.640
But as they say, behind every great fortune is a great crime.

19:14.640 --> 19:17.760
Certificates of deposit were Stanford's bread and butter.

19:17.760 --> 19:22.320
They were like buying a savings bond and customers thought they were insured.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.760
Stanford became a catchphrase for safe.

19:24.760 --> 19:30.040
So what he did was he went out and sold certificates of deposit to investors.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.040
They bought them.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.760
He would pay them interest.

19:33.760 --> 19:36.840
And he paid the interest from the new investors.

19:36.840 --> 19:40.920
Banks are supposed to take certificate of deposit money and put it in safe investments,

19:40.920 --> 19:44.920
getting a small return, which they then used to pay their investors.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.560
Providing investors with a solid return on their investment.

19:48.560 --> 19:50.360
Stanford didn't do that.

19:50.360 --> 19:54.360
He used new investors' money to pay the interest to the old investors.

19:54.360 --> 19:57.200
In other words, a classic Ponzi scheme.

19:57.200 --> 20:01.440
So a classic, no real underlying investment that's making money.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.880
And what he did in the meantime was take money out of the bank and spend it on his lifestyle.

20:05.880 --> 20:10.760
Stanford promised approximately 3% higher returns than similar investments sold by other

20:10.760 --> 20:11.760
banks.

20:11.760 --> 20:17.640
A profit that made Alan Stanford certificates of deposit attractive to investors.

20:17.640 --> 20:22.400
Stanford said he could promise those higher returns because his bank was run smarter and

20:22.400 --> 20:25.320
more efficiently than other banks.

20:25.320 --> 20:30.400
Investors were not supposed to ask too many questions about where the money was invested.

20:30.400 --> 20:33.840
People say, how in the world has this business of yours grown Alan?

20:33.840 --> 20:37.680
I say, well simply because we do things differently, many times we do them the way they used to

20:37.680 --> 20:39.920
do them 20 years ago.

20:39.920 --> 20:43.840
But at least one employee, Charles Haslett, did start asking questions.

20:43.840 --> 20:48.800
In fact, every time I brought up anything in meetings, everybody was looking at me very

20:48.800 --> 20:49.800
shocked.

20:49.800 --> 20:52.200
But do you think people didn't ask questions because the money kept flowing?

20:52.200 --> 20:53.200
Sure.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.200
A blind ignorance.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.760
I didn't see any substance.

20:56.760 --> 20:59.920
I talked to the manager of the bank.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.040
He didn't seem to know a lot about banking in general.

21:03.040 --> 21:07.480
On being arrested, Stanford denied all 14 allegations.

21:07.480 --> 21:13.960
In March 2011, he was convicted on 13 of 14 counts and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.

21:13.960 --> 21:19.660
And a U.S. judge called Alan Stanford's operation one of the most egregious criminal frauds ever

21:19.660 --> 21:22.920
presented to a trial jury in federal court.

21:22.920 --> 21:28.560
His arrest meant the end of almost two decades of illegal financial activity.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.760
Number five, the $20 billion fraud by Bernie Madoff.

21:32.760 --> 21:37.720
Bernie Madoff was the organizer of the largest realized Ponzi scheme in history as former

21:37.720 --> 21:42.160
chairman of the Nasdaq stock market and his squeaky clean image of an investment guru.

21:42.160 --> 21:47.520
He attracted several high profile clients such as film director Steven Spielberg.

21:47.520 --> 21:51.240
But his fraudulent investments were exposed in 2008.

21:51.240 --> 21:56.680
His Ponzi scheme wiped out people's fortunes and more than 15,400 claims were filed against

21:56.680 --> 21:57.680
him.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.760
He became so hated that he had to wear a bulletproof vest to court.

22:01.760 --> 22:06.680
In March of 2009, Madoff pled guilty to the charges and the courts stripped him and his

22:06.680 --> 22:08.200
wife of their wealth.

22:08.200 --> 22:13.880
He was sentenced to jail for 150 years where he passed away in April of 2021.

22:13.880 --> 22:17.400
If you want to see the full story on Bernie Madoff, you can check out the Cold Fusion

22:17.400 --> 22:18.920
episode on him.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.720
Okay, I said I'd say five, but here's a bonus one.

22:22.720 --> 22:26.800
Number six, the entire US Federal Reserve System.

22:26.800 --> 22:31.160
According to some economists, the entire US Federal Reserve System is a Ponzi scheme.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.600
Here's the oversimplified version.

22:33.600 --> 22:37.400
The United States has a huge national debt which is owed to foreign countries such as

22:37.400 --> 22:38.880
China and Japan.

22:38.880 --> 22:43.720
These countries and other investors loan the US government money in exchange for a stable

22:43.720 --> 22:44.880
return.

22:44.880 --> 22:49.040
These debts are short term debts, so the US government has to pay back these investors

22:49.040 --> 22:50.640
trillions yearly.

22:50.640 --> 22:55.160
Currently, the United States can't pay because they don't produce and export enough goods

22:55.160 --> 22:57.320
to support their spending.

22:57.320 --> 23:02.200
So, whenever the debt expires, the government either creates more money through the Federal

23:02.200 --> 23:07.640
Reserve or borrows more money from new investors to pay off the old debt.

23:07.640 --> 23:11.760
In essence, they're borrowing money from new investors to pay off the old investors,

23:11.760 --> 23:13.920
just like Bernie Madoff.

23:13.920 --> 23:19.160
In fact, in jail, Bernie Madoff even said the US government is running the biggest Ponzi

23:19.160 --> 23:23.920
scheme on earth, and he would know a Ponzi scheme if he sees one.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.680
He's not the only one, though.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.080
Michael Snyder wrote,

23:27.080 --> 23:30.600
The Fed is the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of the world, and if the American

23:30.600 --> 23:35.000
people truly understood how it really works, they would be screaming for it to be abolished

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
immediately.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.200
And Michael Lombard stated,

23:39.200 --> 23:44.640
Right now, we are seeing the government hoping investors would keep reinvesting in US bonds

23:44.640 --> 23:48.880
while the Fed picks up the slack, but what happens if they say, we want our money back,

23:48.880 --> 23:52.120
it would make Madoff's Ponzi scheme look like a joke.

23:52.120 --> 24:00.600
So, you can take that for what you will.

24:00.600 --> 24:05.320
So in wrapping up, what are the signs to watch out for to avoid Ponzi schemes?

24:05.320 --> 24:10.080
To avoid falling victim, people should always watch out for returns that seem too good to

24:10.080 --> 24:11.080
be true.

24:11.080 --> 24:15.120
A promise of high returns with minimal risk is a sure red flag.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.760
Such investments just don't exist.

24:17.760 --> 24:22.480
Usually, with high returns, you should see high risk.

24:22.480 --> 24:26.120
Another red flag could be the consistency of returns.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.360
Investments are linked to market conditions, and that should affect the returns that they

24:29.360 --> 24:30.360
bring.

24:30.720 --> 24:35.520
If a scheme promises consistent high returns without being affected by market conditions,

24:35.520 --> 24:38.920
there's a good chance that it could be a Ponzi scheme.

24:38.920 --> 24:43.360
As technology evolves, there's going to be new forms of the same old trick.

24:43.360 --> 24:47.160
Fake cryptocurrencies are the new flavour of the decade so far, and the reason being

24:47.160 --> 24:50.320
is that they're poorly understood by many.

24:50.320 --> 24:55.720
Very recently, some large YouTubers had taken part in a scam called Save the Children Coin,

24:55.720 --> 25:00.760
a coin which promised to help kids in need, but also was promised to go up in value.

25:00.760 --> 25:05.080
The scheme promised to go to the moon, but in reality, it just crashed.

25:05.080 --> 25:08.640
Those who had the knowledge that the whole thing was a scam got out immediately with

25:08.640 --> 25:13.480
a bunch of money, and everyone else lost everything, so be careful out there.

25:13.480 --> 25:16.880
If you're curious and want to see more on the Save the Children Coin, the YouTube channel

25:16.880 --> 25:20.400
CoffeeZilla did a great series on it.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.960
Before we continue, I just want to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor, Raycon

25:23.960 --> 25:26.120
Wireless Earbuds.

25:26.120 --> 25:30.080
Raycon reached out to me to try their wireless earbuds, so I decided to give them a go.

25:30.080 --> 25:33.440
I've been using their everyday earbuds for a few weeks now.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.760
They fit really well in my ears, and there's a bunch of different tips to suit whatever

25:36.760 --> 25:38.080
ear shape you have.

25:38.080 --> 25:42.720
I use them when I go on my morning run, and also for calls with their built-in microphone.

25:42.720 --> 25:46.280
I didn't have any issues with them coming loose or falling out of my ears at all.

25:46.280 --> 25:50.480
These earbuds have 8 hours of playback time, and 32 hour battery life.

25:50.480 --> 25:54.840
Raycon started half the price of other premium audio earbuds, but you're getting the same

25:54.840 --> 25:55.840
sound.

25:55.840 --> 26:00.320
If, for any reason, you're unsatisfied with your purchase, there's a 45 day free return

26:00.320 --> 26:01.320

I'm gonna add a mile.

27:06.880 --> 27:07.880
It's me thinking.

All right.
