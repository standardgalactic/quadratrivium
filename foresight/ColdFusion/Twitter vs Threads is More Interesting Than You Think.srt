00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion. While the world waits for a physical MMA fight

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:13,560
between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, we're being treated with an online fight first.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:19,040
The crazy South African and the subdued robot man go head to head in the social media space.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:24,320
The drama really started back in October of 2022, when Twitter just kept tripping over

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,720
ever since Elon Musk took over. Soon, problems with Twitter's verification was causing

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,960
chaos in the real world. Stock markets became confused, they could not tell the difference

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,680
between the Twitter account of a real company or just some troll online. Individual stocks

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,280
flash-crashed as bizarre announcements were made by trolls pretending to be the PR department

9
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,200
of a company. Twitter also saw a haphazard firing process, lawsuits, bots, advertisers

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,040
leaving, and just generally, nobody really knew what was going on. But over in the other

11
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,360
corner, Zuckerberg was watching all of this closely, and he was waiting.

12
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:06,040
You see, as the Twitter chaos was unfolding, many users switched to other microblogging

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,880
sites like Mastodon, Tumblr, and HiveSocial. Meta employees saw this as a golden opportunity,

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,640
and in January 2023, they began developing an app, which they called Project92. Project92

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,200
would later become Threads, and on June 9th, 2023, in a meeting with employees, Meta's

16
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,280
chief product officer, Chris Cox, would say, quote, we've been hearing from creators and

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,480
public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, end quote.

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:42,040
It was a stab at Elon. On the 5th of July, Threads is launched. The public was skeptical,

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,440
but to the shock of everyone, within just one day, Threads reaches 30 million users.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:53,280
For context, Twitter took four years to reach the same number. Elon was furious and decides

21
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,960
to sue Mark. July 6th, 2023, Zuckerberg does something unexpected. After not tweeting in

22
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,840
11 years, he taunts Mark with a meme. Within five days, Threads would have 100 million users,

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,640
about 30% of Twitter's user base, and at the same time, Twitter's traffic began tanking.

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,280
After this, Mast begins berating Zuckerberg on Twitter. It looks like things are getting heated,

25
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,560
but what is all the fuss about? Is Threads really that big of a threat to Twitter? Obviously,

26
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,600
these 100 million sign-ups on Threads is all just hype right now. But what happens next?

27
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,400
What about the risk of a meta-monopoly? And what about security concerns? In this episode,

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,280
we'll take a look. But also in this story, there's a detail that I haven't heard many

29
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,240
other people talk about. Meta plans to use an open, decentralized technology. You could theoretically

30
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,600
write a post on Facebook, see it on Twitter, or comment on an Instagram post and see it on

31
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,440
TikTok. In short, apps become nothing but an interface skin to view social interactions.

32
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:57,080
This is the biggest major change in social media in 15 years. But just because the technology is

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,080
open doesn't mean that we should trust Zuckerberg. It's all very interesting and we'll get into

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:15,480
that later. But first, let's start at the basics. So backing up, what is Threads? Threads is a

35
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,520
Twitter clone for real-time updates and public conversations. The main difference at the moment

36
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:26,360
is in its features and culture. On Twitter, anything goes. But on Threads, they're actively

37
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,680
not going to encourage politics or hard news. Mark Zuckerberg's company Meta, hosting Facebook,

38
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Instagram and WhatsApp, has launched its own micro-blogging platform called Threads.

39
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Since its launch, Threads grew quickly. Within several hours, the platform amassed over 2 million

40
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,720
users. After one day, it reached 30 million. And at this point, this made Threads the most

41
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,040
rapidly downloaded app in history, surpassing the previous record set by ChatGPT. At the time of

42
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,440
writing, Threads has over 100 million users, about 30% of what Twitter has. So the real reason for

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:07,560
this fast adoption is not the fact that Threads is a better app than Twitter. It's more so that

44
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,160
Zuckerberg has done something very clever. Twitter had to grow its user base from scratch,

45
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,800
but with Threads, people who use Instagram can simply just sign up to Threads using their

46
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,280
existing account and they can bring along their followers and verification. Getting people to

47
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:29,880
download and sign up for a brand new social media platform is hard. Instagram has 2.3 billion users.

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,840
Launching Threads through Instagram reduces a lot of friction.

49
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,880
So to sum up the culture on Threads, it's pretty boring, at least when compared to Twitter.

50
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,760
It seems like Threads is controlled and on guardrails. There's not much of that random chaos

51
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,160
that you see on Twitter, whether that be wacky entertaining posts or bots and spam.

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,640
On Threads, Zuckerberg has stated, quote, the goal is to keep it friendly as it expands. I think

53
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,760
it's possible and will ultimately be the key to success. That's one reason why Twitter never

54
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,720
succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently. In the end,

55
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,840
we could see both platforms coexisting but for different reasons. Twitter is more edgy and

56
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,880
chaotic, whereas Threads, once established and with more features, is a calmer, more corporate

57
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,160
place for discourse. And also, thanks to Instagram, Threads will have the unique advantage of a

58
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,960
generally younger audience and an audience that may come from geographical regions that don't use

59
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,320
Twitter. As for Threads right now, it functions solidly. It works smooth and is familiar. However,

60
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:41,000
it is missing a lot of features. There's no trending news, no DMs, and no strong recommendation

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,880
algorithm, a feature that will be essential to its long-term success, but it's still early days.

62
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,400
So who could come out on top here? Well, looking at corporate history, it's not looking good for

63
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,160
Elon. Elon and Zuckerberg come from opposite ends of business. Elon's experience lies in

64
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,480
delivering physical products. It's more of a mechanical engineering and mechatronics vein.

65
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,800
On the other hand, since 2004, Zuckerberg has basically grown up building social networks.

66
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,080
He sure likes to mine our data, but one thing he has got in spades is experience.

67
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,560
On the other hand, Elon Musk's inexperience in this area is starting to show. Twitter is having

68
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,600
a hard time monetizing. A report by Insider Intelligence is predicting a massive slump in

69
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,360
Twitter's ad revenue by the end of the year. To make up for it, longer tweets, longer videos,

70
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,120
and verification are all now behind paywalls. Even TweetDeck is behind a paywall. This kind of

71
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,520
behavior from Twitter is in line with being a monopoly. They had the biggest platform in the

72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,720
space, so they could bump up costs at will, and users had virtually no choice but to take it.

73
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,960
Even though some did try to move to smaller, similar platforms, there wasn't enough of a

74
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,080
network effect to challenge Twitter. Now with meta and threads in the picture, this is all going to

75
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,640
change. Zuck has led a team whose expertise is in platform monetization, and meta may be able

76
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,360
to figure out what Twitter couldn't. Although threads will not have ads until 1 billion users,

77
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,360
meta already has a good and established relationship with advertising clients.

78
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,120
Threads is also seeing more user engagement than Twitter, which bodes well for advertisers.

79
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Even though Twitter does have a new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, Musk would still tweet business decisions

80
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,440
that would make investors nervous. Without warning, he decided to limit the number of tweets that

81
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:39,160
users can see. Many Twitter users reported problems. Accessing the site to date after Elon Musk said

82
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,320
he's putting a limit on the number of tweets users can read per day.

83
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,000
Elon said that this was to stop bot scraping. But there might be more to this.

84
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,320
Back in March, Musk refused to pay $70 million in fees to Amazon Web Services,

85
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,440
the company that provides Twitter with the infrastructure to run.

86
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,480
Twitter is also being fined $100,000 because Elon isn't paying the company's rent,

87
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,640
as he believes that it's not worth it in San Francisco. So if the trends are anything to go

88
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,280
by and Amazon Web Services isn't being paid again, it's possible that they've been throttling

89
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:14,600
data usage for Twitter. And this could be the real reason behind limiting the views for tweets.

90
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,320
So all in all, it looks like, purely from a business technical ability,

91
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,000
Zuck seems to have the upper hand here. But again, anything could happen.

92
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,800
So let's take a look at this lawsuit.

93
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,200
Twitter is reportedly threatening to sue Metta over its new Threads platform.

94
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,280
News outlets say a lawyer for Twitter has sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg.

95
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,200
After the initial success of Threads, Musk made his thoughts clear.

96
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,400
Quote,

97
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,880
Competition is fine, cheating is not. In a legal letter to Zuckerberg,

98
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,280
Twitter would accuse them of, quote,

99
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:54,040
systematic, willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual

100
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,320
property. It's going to be a hard case. And according to Polk Wagner,

101
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,600
a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, quote,

102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,320
Twitter also needs to show that Threads took information that was economically valuable

103
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,280
and which the company had taken responsible efforts to keep secret.

104
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:14,040
Twitter had also claimed that Metta had taken ex-employees who, quote,

105
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,600
had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential

106
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,920
information, end quote. And they called Threads a, quote, copycat app.

107
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,040
Ironically, Musk had previously tweeted that the geniuses that he fired should be able to

108
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,920
find jobs elsewhere. A Metta spokesperson, Andy Stone, would rebut, quote,

109
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,960
No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee. That's just not a thing, end quote.

110
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,520
So in this whole story, Zuckerberg is coming out looking like the more measured one here.

111
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,760
It does seem like after his hearings and podcast appearances,

112
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,600
the general public's impression of him has improved. But we shouldn't forget Cambridge

113
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,840
Analytica and how Facebook collected personal data from millions of users,

114
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,480
some of which was used for political advertising. This isn't to mention the countless other

115
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,800
scandals that Metta has been embroiled in. And also around 32% of the world's population

116
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,720
is on Instagram and soon every world leader could be on Threads. Metta has the GDP and influence

117
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,680
over populations that most governments would dream of. Metta platforms knows your personality,

118
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,720
political stances, who you're friends with, all to serve you better ads. But this knowledge and

119
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,840
data can be abused in many ways, sold for profit, or to cause political influence.

120
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,840
To add to this, former Facebook staff have previously warned that Zuckerberg has way too

121
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,880
much controlling power within his companies. Threads has so much tracking and user profiling

122
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,040
that it goes beyond what's allowed by EU data laws. That should tell you something.

123
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,440
Okay, so here's the really interesting bit. While everyone is talking about the massive

124
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,960
sign-up rate of Threads, there's another story going on here. Metta plans to use a forgotten

125
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:06,360
2018 decentralized web technology called ActivityPub. So, what is ActivityPub?

126
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,640
David Pierce from The Verge sums it up perfectly.

127
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:59,240
I was there in the early days of the web and this whole thing with ActivityPub is as big a deal

128
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,920
as HTML was back then. This is the single biggest opportunity I've seen for the web

129
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,080
since the dawn of the web. This is the biggest change in social media in 15 years.

130
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,400
The new wave of social media companies that use this kind of decentralized protocol are

131
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:22,840
collectively known as the Fediverse. Unfortunately, Metta may use the technology for their own gain.

132
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:28,840
The really only thing about Threads that has me interested is their ActivityPub integration,

133
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,000
so that people on Instagram Threads can interact with people on the Fediverse,

134
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,880
something like Mastodon. I don't see Facebook approaching this in a way that's designed to

135
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:43,320
break down walls and create a more open internet where platforms get to speak to each other

136
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,840
for the benefit of the end user, you, which is the whole point of ActivityPub. Alternatively,

137
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,960
I think Facebook will more likely want to use ActivityPub as free content for its own walled

138
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,520
garden platform. Many people like myself are pretty much only on Mastodon and if someone like

139
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,240
myself refuses to open a Threads account, it won't really impact Facebook since people can

140
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,680
still theoretically follow my Mastodon from those threads. I think this ActivityPub aspect is an

141
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,120
important area of the story to keep your eye on. If Threads is successful and using ActivityPub,

142
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,080
Zuckerberg theoretically could create as many clones of different standalone apps that he wants

143
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:25,560
with ease. The CEO of Mastodon, a Twitter competitor who also uses ActivityPub, thinks that Metta

144
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,200
may embrace ActivityPub only to destroy it.

145
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,640
I think the internet is like resetting. It feels to me more like 2011 than whatever we

146
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,160
thought last year was going to be. All the big publishers are focusing now on email and direct

147
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,200
home pages, which is fascinating. The social networks are splintering. We're seeing actual

148
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,920
market share changes. None of this stuff was happening a year ago. Okay, maybe I have like

149
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,760
three or four interest-based places that I go instead of one monolithic place. That's why

150
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,600
decentralized social is interesting. And then for these companies, what makes it attractive

151
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,720
is they get to farm out content moderation. They get to say to Congress or whoever else,

152
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,200
look at all this competition. You can bring your own content moderation algorithm to the mix.

153
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,360
We're only in charge if you want us to be. And I think that is utterly appealing to all of us.

154
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,280
Cambridge Analytica was a warning. Today's social media companies are much bigger than

155
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:29,960
they were then. And Zuckerberg is on his way to a social media app monopoly, with Facebook,

156
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:36,840
Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and now threads all under his belt. If for any reason Metta was

157
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,480
persuaded to block a trending topic or sway popular opinion, it's just that little bit

158
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,560
easier for them to do now. What happens next is anyone's guess, but this should be looked at

159
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,200
closely. As for Twitter, it's unlikely that it will die. But the game has changed. From a business

160
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,840
perspective, there's a lot of new risk that's built up. If Elon says something crazy that

161
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,560
offends people or something on Twitter breaks, users can now just jump to threads. It's going to

162
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:06,680
be a slow grind, but the potential is there for a death by a thousand cut scenario for Twitter.

163
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:12,440
So what's the final most probable outcome? Well, in my opinion, I think that once the

164
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,960
initial hype dies down from threads, we could see both platforms coexist just with a different

165
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,440
culture, different users, and different use cases. In the end, the biggest loser of all of this is

166
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,560
going to be Linda, the new CEO of Twitter. She's definitely going to have her work cut out. And

167
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,760
as a side point, imagine if all of this was just advertising for the upcoming boxing match between

168
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,640
Musk and Zuckerberg. That would be pretty funny if that was true. Anyway, that's about it from me.

169
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,400
