00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,000
With all seen and read reports of Ponty scheme scandals getting exposed, the details always

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
talk about a significant number of people who have lost their savings in these schemes.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,920
But even after investigations, arrests and sentences, new scammers will pop up and keep

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,800
doing the same thing over and over again.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
But what exactly is a Ponty scheme and what are the science to look out for and how can

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,360
you protect yourself?

8
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,800
And what are the biggest Ponty schemes of all time?

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,600
You might be surprised to find out that the US government might be running the biggest

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,880
Ponty scheme in history according to some economists, so stay tuned till the end of

11
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:48,800
the episode to learn about that one.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:58,080
Let's get into it.

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,920
But first of all, what is a Ponty scheme?

14
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,320
A Ponty scheme is an investment fraud.

15
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,360
The scheme promises high and sometimes quick returns, but in reality it's just paying

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,680
off existing investors with funds collected from new investors who have also been fooled,

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,560
fooled by the promise of a quick buck.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,120
Ponty schemes use money from their new investors to pay off old investors while taking a cut

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,920
for themselves.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,600
Since there is no money being earned by selling a product or a service, Ponty schemes require

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,640
a constant flow of new money to sustain.

22
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,960
Not surprisingly, after a time, it becomes increasingly harder to find new investors,

23
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:42,000
and when that happens, the scheme fails.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,560
A Ponty scheme is not to be confused with a pyramid scheme.

25
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,440
A pyramid scheme requires recruitment to bring in more people to increase their returns.

26
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,560
A Ponty scheme may or may not need that.

27
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,600
For example, a Ponty scheme would be something like BitConnect, a fake cryptocurrency that

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,760
promised huge returns from a mysterious AI trading algorithm, but in reality, it used

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,080
money from old investors to pay off new investors.

30
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,960
And let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it.

31
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,960
The world is not anymore the way it used to be.

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,960
No, no, no.

33
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,360
BitConnect!

34
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Wow!

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,760
Thousands of victims swindled out of more than $2 billion may be receiving some justice

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,960
after one of the leaders of a crypto scheme pleaded guilty.

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,440
This is believed to be the biggest cryptocurrency fraud ever charged criminal.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,560
He says this scam, run through a crypto lending program called BitConnect, is believed to

39
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,120
have swindled thousands of people around the world out of more than $2 billion worth

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,280
of Bitcoin.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,320
They claimed that if you traded your Bitcoin for their cryptocurrency, crypto currency

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,160
called the BitConnect coin, that a trading bot would make sure that you didn't lose

43
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
any money.

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,600
Also, offering investors returns as high as 40% per month, but prosecutors say BitConnect

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,720
actually operated like a Ponzi scheme, using investor funds to repay other BitConnect

46
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,720
investors.

47
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,200
A pyramid scheme, on the other hand, relies heavily on recruiting.

48
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,160
So something like Metabolife, where members would sell supplements and take a cut of the

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,920
sales of those who they recruited, forming a pyramid.

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,560
Now, have you ever wondered why an unusual word like Ponzi is associated with financial

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,560
fraud?

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,360
Its name is as such, because it's named after a man named Charles Ponzi.

53
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,560
So who was Charles Ponzi?

54
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,680
Charles Ponzi was a swindler, known for starting a scheme of this kind in 1920 in Boston.

55
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,440
Charles Ponzi was born in 1882 in Italy.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,400
As a young boy, he kept stealing from the church so much that his family got sick of

57
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,720
him and deported him to America in 1903.

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,080
Charles worked in a restaurant as a waiter, but continually shortchanged the customers,

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,520
keeping the difference so he was fired.

60
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
In 1907, he moved to Canada and because of his skills with numbers, he got employed at

61
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,080
a bank.

62
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Here, he would forge the signatures of clients and cash their checks.

63
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,400
He was caught and spent three years in prison.

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,600
After his release, Charles went back to the US and started up a scheme to smuggle Italian

65
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,920
immigrants from Canada to the US.

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:23,520
Again, he was caught and jailed for two years.

67
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,480
This time when he got out, he went to Boston and in November of 1919, he came across the

68
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,720
idea for his grand scheme.

69
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,440
Supposedly, this was achieved by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and

70
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,600
redeeming them at face value in the US where the currency was much stronger.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:50,280
He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days.

72
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,960
In 1907, an international postal congress had agreed to issue postal reply coupons throughout

73
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,080
the world.

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,280
The bearers could redeem these international coupons for postage stamps in their local

75
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,360
country.

76
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,440
This was to address a real problem.

77
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:13,240
Immigrants who came to America could afford to buy stamps, the relatives who stayed home

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
could not.

79
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,960
This was a way to allow relatives back home to write back to the family in America.

80
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,520
If you went to a European post office with American dollars and bought postal reply

81
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,240
coupons and then brought them to this country and cashed them in, you got US postage many

82
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,120
times more valuable than the US money you spent for them.

83
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,400
This was the premise.

84
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,200
Ponzi believed that for every dollar of postal reply coupons purchased, he could earn $5 when

85
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,760
he redeemed them for stamps.

86
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:52,800
With a 400% profit from these initial purchases, Ponzi would buy additional coupons and redeem

87
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,360
them for even more money.

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,920
It seemed to be a proposition that couldn't lose.

89
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,160
The only issue with this plan was that Ponzi would need to employ people to line up and

90
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,000
collect coupons and stamps, gather them up and ship them overseas, so this would probably

91
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
cost more than the money generated from the scheme itself.

92
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
So Charles Ponzi decided to buy no coupon stamps at all and just tell people that the

93
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,440
scheme would make them rich.

94
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,520
Double your money in three months.

95
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,160
America was booming in 1920, so people were all looking for a quick way to get rich.

96
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,760
Wild financial speculation was all the rage, so Ponzi fit right in.

97
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,200
He was charismatic and had a gift for talking, so everyone wanted a piece of the pie and

98
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,360
word quickly spread around.

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,480
Some people would take out their life savings from a bank to invest with Ponzi.

100
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:47,920
But the thing was, Ponzi would actually pay back investors as promised, so the whole thing

101
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,040
seemed legitimate and people went crazy.

102
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:57,680
By March of 1920, investors had thrown in $400,000, but Ponzi owed them $600,000 because of the

103
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,760
promises of his scheme.

104
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,560
Most people trusted him so much that they kept their money in so they could earn even

105
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
more.

106
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,080
Because of this, Charles could always make the payments when they came due.

107
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,560
Two months later in May, investors had thrown in $1.6 million, and by July, this had swelled

108
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,200
to $41 million, but at this stage, Charles owed $55 million, and that was the problem.

109
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,560
The more money Charles Ponzi received, the more in debt he was.

110
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,200
If he promised to double everyone's money, he would just be owing more and more.

111
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,120
All of this didn't matter though, as long as everyone didn't want their money out

112
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
at once.

113
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Soon, Ponzi was averaging $3.4 million a day.

114
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,280
He bought himself a $7 million home with a heated pool and air conditioning, absolutely

115
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,920
unheard of in 1920.

116
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,720
He bought the very same shipping firm when he smuggled Italian immigrants just so he

117
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,080
could fire his old boss.

118
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,600
Six months ago, he was broke, but now he could have anything he wanted.

119
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,400
Massive crowds were growing outside of Ponzi's office, and officials got suspicious.

120
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
Police were called in to investigate, but after they talked to Charles Ponzi, two of

121
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,200
the three officers ended up investing.

122
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:15,640
In fact, a quarter of Boston's police force were investing with Charles Ponzi.

123
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:20,760
On the 26th of July, a Boston newspaper ran the first critical story of Ponzi.

124
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,280
It stated, if Ponzi could make 300% profit for his investors, why does he put his money

125
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:29,320
in the bank where it would only make him 2% or 3%?

126
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,080
Why not just invest all the money with himself?

127
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,880
It was a good point.

128
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,800
And another article stated that the numbers didn't add up.

129
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,480
There would have to be 160 million of these coupons circulating to amass such profits,

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,320
but in reality, there's only about 27,000 of these in the world, and there was also

131
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,000
no reports of massive purchases of coupons.

132
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,840
When these news articles broke, there was a massive panic, a riot ensued at Ponzi's

133
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840
office.

134
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:02,640
$27 million were withdrawn in two days, but Ponzi could afford to pay everyone back,

135
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,880
and he did it with a smile while serving people coffee and donuts as they lined up.

136
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,920
Nerves were calmed, and people actually reinvested.

137
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,600
But it wouldn't last.

138
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,840
Government regulators and more bad press came Ponzi's way.

139
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,840
The latter of which stated he was completely bankrupt.

140
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,920
It started another panic and a rush for people to get all of their money out.

141
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,600
Over $200 million had been invested, but Ponzi was short $110 million.

142
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Everyone tried to get their money out at once, and he couldn't pay.

143
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,520
By August of 1920, he was all over.

144
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,040
Ponzi wasn't dieted on 86 counts of fraud, and many investors lost everything.

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,080
It was a massive lesson for them, and us, to never just follow the crowd, and always

146
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
do your research before investing.

147
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,600
Even though Charles Ponzi got convicted and jailed for his deceit, it did not deter others

148
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,760
from coming up with such schemes.

149
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:05,040
So why do people keep falling for it?

150
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,520
Almost everyone wants to earn easy money, and get rich.

151
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,280
In the real world, this usually means that you need to work hard for it, but it's a

152
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,920
human tendency to look for shortcuts.

153
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,280
But taking shortcuts often leads to trouble, as is with the case with Ponzi schemes.

154
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,640
But it's not necessarily greed that attracts people towards them.

155
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,840
Ponzi schemes are designed in such a way that they appear legitimate.

156
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,120
Investors may genuinely see it as a promising avenue for investment.

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,920
Later on in the episode, we'll take a look at some warning signs to watch out for when

158
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,040
deciding if an investment is a Ponzi scheme or not.

159
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,440
The organisers of this kind of fraud usually target those who have spare money, or those

160
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,720
who need money, both are looking for quick and high returns.

161
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:54,680
Usually, the unemployed, all those coming from a financially weak background, fall prey

162
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,120
to these schemes.

163
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,720
Essentially, it all boils down to how convincingly the Ponzi organiser can fabricate a story,

164
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:08,640
a story of quick and assured success, playing on the ambitions, dreams, financial situation,

165
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,920
and financial literacy of people.

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,560
Emotions can often overthrow logic, so people end up believing that they're being helped

167
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,160
when they're actually being conned.

168
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,560
So let's take a look at five of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history.

169
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:31,040
Number one, the $593 million fraud by a Minister of Scientology, Reid Slatkin.

170
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,640
Reid Slatkin would start his scheme in 1986.

171
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,160
He would get people, including some very high profile names and many other Scientologists,

172
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:43,760
to invest in what was an unlicensed, quote, investment club.

173
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,600
He would pay out large sums of money to investors, claiming that his investment were working.

174
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,280
But again, in reality, he was just doing that old method of using new investor funds to

175
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,000
pay off the old investors.

176
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,280
He scammed around 800 investors for more than $593 million across 15 years before being

177
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
caught.

178
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,360
He admitted to fraud in 2002 and was jailed for 14 years.

179
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,160
Number two, the $1.2 billion fraud by Scott Rothstein.

180
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,880
Scott Rothstein started inviting investors into his Ponzi scheme.

181
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,080
He claimed to purchase highly confidential legal settlements using his law firm.

182
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:28,420
Rothstein's legal specialty is suing for sexual harassment, a down and dirty game where defendants

183
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,040
pay big money to settle lawsuits quickly and quietly.

184
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
Those are usually paid out over a long period of time.

185
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,480
Rothstein used wealthy investors to pay his clients up front, promising the investors

186
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,120
a big return on their money over time.

187
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,240
In some cases, it was a promise of more than 200%.

188
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,640
I was shown what a confidential settlement agreement looked like, and it had all the

189
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,520
information was blacked out.

190
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,800
It had the name of the plaintiff, the name of the defendant was blacked out, the attorney

191
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,600
was blacked out.

192
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
Everyone was blacked out.

193
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,320
If you want to be able to invest in something that couldn't be verified, I didn't even know

194
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,320
if it was real.

195
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,000
In fact, I didn't even think it was real.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:16,800
The idea is a bonanza attracting big money players like a modern day gold rush.

197
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,160
We three kings be stealing the gold.

198
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:25,880
Scott ran with movie stars, rock stars, kid rock, Pam Anderson, athletes, superstars,

199
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,120
Dan Marino, Alonzo Morning, Sarah Palin.

200
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,640
There was pictures in his office of him shaking hands with Jeb Bush and George Bush.

201
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,800
From forging documents with judge's signatures to making corrupt law enforcement officers

202
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,520
to do his bidding, Scott often went to great lengths to sustain his fraud.

203
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:47,800
People in the community were always asking, how are they growing so fast?

204
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,560
Where does that money come from?

205
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:53,440
And I would always say, I don't know, but not from the practice of law.

206
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,080
We were offered 207% return, and I wanted to see how much money you need to invest to

207
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,080
get rich.

208
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:10,160
I calculated if you keep in $150,000 for 13 years, that $150,000 turns into $21 trillion.

209
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,120
That's enough to pay off the entire deficit of the United States and have more money beside.

210
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,520
He started off with hundreds of thousands of dollars.

211
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,720
He had to return millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions.

212
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,840
So it had to collapse, there was no way to go forward.

213
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,320
He ran out of funds to pay investors by early 2009.

214
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,840
He raised an extra $100 million investment, but that still wasn't enough to keep the scheme

215
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,840
afloat.

216
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,800
When he knew his time was up, he fled to Morocco, but soon returned to the US, and was arrested

217
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
at that point.

218
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,960
Tempers Flare, it's a wrestling match of sorts outside of Florida courtroom, this after Scott

219
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,960
Rothstein, who has ties to Rhode Island, pleads guilty to a billion dollar Ponzi scheme.

220
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:58,360
He pled guilty in court and was sentenced to 50 years in jail in 2010.

221
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Number 3.

222
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,960
The $3.7 billion fraud by Tom Pettis.

223
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:08,240
Businessman Thomas J. Pettis was convicted of male fraud, wire fraud, money laundering

224
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,080
and conspiracy for the operation of a $3.7 billion Ponzi scheme.

225
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,520
Thomas convinced investors that by putting money into his organization, they would fund

226
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,880
the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit.

227
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,280
However, no such investments were ever made.

228
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:30,400
The funds were diverted for other purposes, such as paying off those who helped organize

229
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,320
the fraud and also financing Scott's extravagant lifestyle.

230
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,240
This is how Pettis was able to manage his scheme at PCI.

231
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,360
First you need to ask yourself how to store such as Walmart, Costco, Best Buy and other

232
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,400
big box retailers sell merchandise so cheaply.

233
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:54,240
One answer is found in a little known industry known as diverting or supply chain management.

234
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,120
In today's market, many retailers do not like to keep a large inventory.

235
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,360
Instead, they buy products as they have a need to sell.

236
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,720
This concept is called just-in-time retailing.

237
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,480
To keep their prices down, they reach out to a middleman.

238
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,720
Pettis was a master diverter.

239
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,200
Here is how his program worked.

240
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,520
He brought on board investors to finance the deals.

241
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,000
Their money was put in a lock box account for safekeeping.

242
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,360
The money was then funneled through a business called Nationwide, where they would buy merchandise

243
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,800
from closeouts or stores going out of business in bulk for low prices.

244
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,720
Eventually they were able to buy large lots of inventory directly from the manufacturer.

245
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,240
Next, the merchandise was shipped to a warehouse where it was held until a deal could be made

246
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,360
where it would be sold at a higher price to a retailer.

247
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,320
The retailers would still save money by not having to maintain such large inventories.

248
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,000
Ultimately, the money from the investment would go back to Nationwide, where they would

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,440
take their cut and the investors' money would be put back into the lock box, where they

250
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,000
would get their return on their investment.

251
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,520
This was a very lucrative deal for everyone involved.

252
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,240
The problem was, at some point, Pettis stopped buying merchandise.

253
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,560
The warehouses were empty and nothing was being sold.

254
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:21,880
All the returns investors were making were coming from the new investors, with Pettis

255
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,680
taking a cut off the top for himself.

256
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,280
The scam was reported to the authorities by one of his co-conspirators in 2008, and he

257
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,520
was arrested soon afterwards.

258
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:39,400
He was convicted in December of 2009 and was sentenced to 50 years in prison.

259
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,920
The Seven Billion Dollar Fraud by R. Allen Stanford

260
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,680
Allen Stanford was among the wealthiest men in the US.

261
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,760
He built the lavish lifestyle from banking and smooth talk.

262
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,600
But his slick sales pitch turned out to be a lie.

263
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,080
Stanford ran one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in American history.

264
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,040
That isn't until his House of Cards collapsed.

265
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:06,840
R. Allen Stanford, the chairman of Stanford Financial Group, orchestrated a seven billion

266
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,600
dollar fraud by selling certificates of deposits via his company's offshore bank in Antigua.

267
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,080
He cheated 30,000 investors from a few dozen countries and pocketed some of the proceeds.

268
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,840
He used the money to gamble in business ventures, acquire dubious real estate deals, and even

269
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,880
on cricket tournaments.

270
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,200
He got a little bit friendly with the player's wives and girlfriends.

271
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,360
We can see some pictures of this.

272
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760
The English player's not particularly pleased.

273
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,960
That's Matt Pry's wife sitting on his knee.

274
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,320
And there was just a little bit of disquietment.

275
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,720
The England players, when they saw the behavior of Sir Allen Stanford with their various wives

276
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,000
and girlfriends, the Daily Mail has picked up on this and has that very picture with the

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,960
England player's fury at Stanford's antics with the wags turning into an ego-fueled fuss

278
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,080
saying the players were gobsmacked.

279
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,760
Is it fun being a billionaire?

280
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:09,560
Well, yes, I have to say it is fun being a billionaire, but it's hard work.

281
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:14,640
But as they say, behind every great fortune is a great crime.

282
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,760
Certificates of deposit were Stanford's bread and butter.

283
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,320
They were like buying a savings bond and customers thought they were insured.

284
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,760
Stanford became a catchphrase for safe.

285
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:30,040
So what he did was he went out and sold certificates of deposit to investors.

286
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
They bought them.

287
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,760
He would pay them interest.

288
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,840
And he paid the interest from the new investors.

289
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,920
Banks are supposed to take certificate of deposit money and put it in safe investments,

290
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,920
getting a small return, which they then used to pay their investors.

291
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,560
Providing investors with a solid return on their investment.

292
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,360
Stanford didn't do that.

293
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,360
He used new investors' money to pay the interest to the old investors.

294
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,200
In other words, a classic Ponzi scheme.

295
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,440
So a classic, no real underlying investment that's making money.

296
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,880
And what he did in the meantime was take money out of the bank and spend it on his lifestyle.

297
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:10,760
Stanford promised approximately 3% higher returns than similar investments sold by other

298
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,760
banks.

299
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,640
A profit that made Alan Stanford certificates of deposit attractive to investors.

300
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:22,400
Stanford said he could promise those higher returns because his bank was run smarter and

301
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,320
more efficiently than other banks.

302
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,400
Investors were not supposed to ask too many questions about where the money was invested.

303
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,840
People say, how in the world has this business of yours grown Alan?

304
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,680
I say, well simply because we do things differently, many times we do them the way they used to

305
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,920
do them 20 years ago.

306
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:43,840
But at least one employee, Charles Haslett, did start asking questions.

307
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,800
In fact, every time I brought up anything in meetings, everybody was looking at me very

308
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
shocked.

309
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,200
But do you think people didn't ask questions because the money kept flowing?

310
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Sure.

311
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
A blind ignorance.

312
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,760
I didn't see any substance.

313
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,920
I talked to the manager of the bank.

314
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,040
He didn't seem to know a lot about banking in general.

315
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,480
On being arrested, Stanford denied all 14 allegations.

316
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,960
In March 2011, he was convicted on 13 of 14 counts and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.

317
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:19,660
And a U.S. judge called Alan Stanford's operation one of the most egregious criminal frauds ever

318
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:22,920
presented to a trial jury in federal court.

319
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,560
His arrest meant the end of almost two decades of illegal financial activity.

320
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,760
Number five, the $20 billion fraud by Bernie Madoff.

321
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,720
Bernie Madoff was the organizer of the largest realized Ponzi scheme in history as former

322
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,160
chairman of the Nasdaq stock market and his squeaky clean image of an investment guru.

323
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,520
He attracted several high profile clients such as film director Steven Spielberg.

324
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,240
But his fraudulent investments were exposed in 2008.

325
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,680
His Ponzi scheme wiped out people's fortunes and more than 15,400 claims were filed against

326
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
him.

327
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,760
He became so hated that he had to wear a bulletproof vest to court.

328
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,680
In March of 2009, Madoff pled guilty to the charges and the courts stripped him and his

329
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,200
wife of their wealth.

330
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,880
He was sentenced to jail for 150 years where he passed away in April of 2021.

331
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,400
If you want to see the full story on Bernie Madoff, you can check out the Cold Fusion

332
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,920
episode on him.

333
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,720
Okay, I said I'd say five, but here's a bonus one.

334
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,800
Number six, the entire US Federal Reserve System.

335
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,160
According to some economists, the entire US Federal Reserve System is a Ponzi scheme.

336
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,600
Here's the oversimplified version.

337
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,400
The United States has a huge national debt which is owed to foreign countries such as

338
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,880
China and Japan.

339
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,720
These countries and other investors loan the US government money in exchange for a stable

340
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,880
return.

341
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,040
These debts are short term debts, so the US government has to pay back these investors

342
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,640
trillions yearly.

343
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,160
Currently, the United States can't pay because they don't produce and export enough goods

344
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,320
to support their spending.

345
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,200
So, whenever the debt expires, the government either creates more money through the Federal

346
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:07,640
Reserve or borrows more money from new investors to pay off the old debt.

347
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,760
In essence, they're borrowing money from new investors to pay off the old investors,

348
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,920
just like Bernie Madoff.

349
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,160
In fact, in jail, Bernie Madoff even said the US government is running the biggest Ponzi

350
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,920
scheme on earth, and he would know a Ponzi scheme if he sees one.

351
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,680
He's not the only one, though.

352
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,080
Michael Snyder wrote,

353
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,600
The Fed is the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of the world, and if the American

354
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,000
people truly understood how it really works, they would be screaming for it to be abolished

355
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
immediately.

356
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,200
And Michael Lombard stated,

357
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,640
Right now, we are seeing the government hoping investors would keep reinvesting in US bonds

358
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,880
while the Fed picks up the slack, but what happens if they say, we want our money back,

359
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,120
it would make Madoff's Ponzi scheme look like a joke.

360
00:23:52,120 --> 00:24:00,600
So, you can take that for what you will.

361
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,320
So in wrapping up, what are the signs to watch out for to avoid Ponzi schemes?

362
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:10,080
To avoid falling victim, people should always watch out for returns that seem too good to

363
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
be true.

364
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:15,120
A promise of high returns with minimal risk is a sure red flag.

365
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,760
Such investments just don't exist.

366
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:22,480
Usually, with high returns, you should see high risk.

367
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,120
Another red flag could be the consistency of returns.

368
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,360
Investments are linked to market conditions, and that should affect the returns that they

369
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,360
bring.

370
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,520
If a scheme promises consistent high returns without being affected by market conditions,

371
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,920
there's a good chance that it could be a Ponzi scheme.

372
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,360
As technology evolves, there's going to be new forms of the same old trick.

373
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,160
Fake cryptocurrencies are the new flavour of the decade so far, and the reason being

374
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,320
is that they're poorly understood by many.

375
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,720
Very recently, some large YouTubers had taken part in a scam called Save the Children Coin,

376
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,760
a coin which promised to help kids in need, but also was promised to go up in value.

377
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:05,080
The scheme promised to go to the moon, but in reality, it just crashed.

378
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,640
Those who had the knowledge that the whole thing was a scam got out immediately with

379
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,480
a bunch of money, and everyone else lost everything, so be careful out there.

380
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,880
If you're curious and want to see more on the Save the Children Coin, the YouTube channel

381
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
CoffeeZilla did a great series on it.

382
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,960
Before we continue, I just want to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor, Raycon

383
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,120
Wireless Earbuds.

384
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:30,080
Raycon reached out to me to try their wireless earbuds, so I decided to give them a go.

385
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,440
I've been using their everyday earbuds for a few weeks now.

386
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,760
They fit really well in my ears, and there's a bunch of different tips to suit whatever

387
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,080
ear shape you have.

388
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,720
I use them when I go on my morning run, and also for calls with their built-in microphone.

389
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,280
I didn't have any issues with them coming loose or falling out of my ears at all.

390
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,480
These earbuds have 8 hours of playback time, and 32 hour battery life.

391
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,840
Raycon started half the price of other premium audio earbuds, but you're getting the same

392
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,840
sound.

393
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,320
If, for any reason, you're unsatisfied with your purchase, there's a 45 day free return

394
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
policy.
