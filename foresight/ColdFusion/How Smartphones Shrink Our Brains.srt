00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
This video is brought to you by Ground News.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We know for a fact that what all of these systems do, every single one,

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
is it exploits our own natural tendencies in human beings to get and want feedback.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And that feedback, chemically speaking, is the release of dopamine in your brain.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And so what these feedback loops do, and they exist everywhere,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
in Call of Duty, in other video games, in social networking sites,

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
they get you to react.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And I think that if you get too desensitized and you need it over and over and over again,

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
then you become actually detached from the world in which you live.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Become callous, you become crude.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
And live in front of your screen.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So we all know the benefits and usefulness of smartphones.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They're amazing.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
A little rectangle in your pocket that does everything.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But that comes with the price.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There's a growing body of research that indicates that smartphones can actually change the way our brains work.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Did you know that just the mere presence of your phone in a room can destroy your cognitive functioning,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
even if it's switched off?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Crazy, I know.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But literal experiments have proved this.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
In this episode, we'll take a look at how phones affect our memory, stress levels, and cognitive function.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And also, here's a question.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If the collective brains of billions of people on Earth have been unknowingly altered worldwide,

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
what does this mean for society?

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's not all bad news, though.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We'll also take a look at how we can help ourselves.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In 2007, amidst the chaos of the financial crisis, the first iPhone was launched.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And we are calling it iPhone.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Computer giant Apple says it's reinvented the phone, marrying a mobile with an iPod, giving birth to the iPhone.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
An iPod, a cell phone, and a portable internet, all in a little lightweight package.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The big attraction here right now is encased in a plastic tube back there, surrounded by an admiring crowd.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's a sleek aluminum and stainless steel creation.

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A cell phone doesn't have any buttons, just a touchscreen.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It only had 16 apps, and that was it.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No app store, nothing else.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was relatively simple by today's standards.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Suddenly, buttons were replaced with a large responsive touchscreen interface.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
People could now swipe, tap, scroll, zoom, and browse the web more efficiently than they could on a desktop.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
At the time, such features were unheard of.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Although it looked interesting, very few predicted just how quickly such a small device could envelop our lives.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,000
With each passing year, the phones got faster, the features grew, and the software exponentially improved.

43
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Apps became useful, but then came the algorithms and feeds.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And before we knew it, most of us had entered a 2D virtual reality.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
A completely separate reality and view of the world, but through a screen.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This was powered by algorithms designed to keep your attention, and apps designed to trigger the dopamine responses in your brain.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It sounds like a sci-fi film when put that way, but we all know this story by now.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It was one of the main themes of the Netflix show, The Social Dilemma,

49
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
a hallmark look into how algorithms rule our lives, and the people that made those algorithms knew what they were doing.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
In 2008, when the true impact of smartphones was still a mystery,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
UCLA psychiatrist Gary Small began sounding the caution alarm.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He was saying that heavy smartphone use could alter brain function by weakening the circuits needed for in-person interaction and reading non-verbal cues.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Remember, the iPhone was only one year old at this time.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,000
At the time, his claims were called, quote, interesting and, quote, provocative by the science community, but it still couldn't be proved.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Fast forward a decade and a half later, and smartphones and their cognitive effects are being reexamined.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But what about the less known stuff? What other effects do smartphones have on the mind?

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Although there's still much to learn about the long-term cognitive impact, there is some scientific evidence that should make us pause.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
If you've ever felt that phantom buzz, or feel anxious when you haven't checked your phone in a while,

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
you don't need an expert to tell you that there's something strange at play.

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What exactly are smartphones doing to our minds and personalities?

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's take a look at the research. We're going to cover memory, addiction, cognitive function, and stress. Let's break them down.

62
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Back in the day, you had to memorize all your friends' numbers, or actually listen in maths class because your teachers said that you couldn't carry a calculator 24-7.

63
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Cab drivers also back in the day had no GPS. They had to know where they were going without stopping to check.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They had to know all the streets. It turns out that exercising that mental muscle of memory has given cab drivers physically larger hippocampi.

65
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's the memory centre of the brain, but also aids in learning and emotional processing.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But now, today, we heavily rely on our devices as memory aids, but new research suggests that maybe this isn't a great sign.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A 2021 study found that excessive smartphone use can reduce the size of the hippocampus, especially in young developing brains.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There's been other studies with similar findings, but unfortunately, there's even more.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
A meta-study of MRI scans of chronic smartphone users found that they have lower grey matter volumes in specific regions of the brain.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This includes the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal regions.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
While the research is still in its early stages, less grey matter usually means a higher risk of depression, schizophrenia, and dementia.

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But remember, these are chronic smartphone users.

73
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But on that note, the cost of this might be an enormous increase in dementia.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Quote,

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The less you use that mind of yours, the less you use the systems that are responsible for complicated things like episodic memories or cognitive flexibility, the more likely it is to develop dementia.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Once you stop using your memory, it will get worse, which will make you use your devices more.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:29,000
According to Professor Oliver Hardett, even an over-reliance on GPSs could reduce the density of grey matter in the brain.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To combat the effects of hippocampus shrinkage, regular exercise has shown to increase grey matter and increase memory.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's also good to try and remember directions where possible, and generally try to use your memory instead of your phone where practical.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And if you still really just can't put your phone down, apps like Hippo Camera can help.

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hippo Camera is a really easy to use smartphone application that mimics how the brain supports memory.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Specific behaviors also don't do our brains any favours. One of these is attempting to multitask.

83
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Interestingly, humans multitasking is a myth. Only 2.5% of us can do it effectively.

84
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Catherine Price writes about this in her book, How to Break Up with Your Phone.

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
In particular, she wants about the dangers of continual partial attention.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's checking your phone while mid-conversation, or scrolling on social media while watching TV. Sound familiar?

87
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
While we do this to attempt to be more productive, it harms our cognitive health.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
In fact, trying to consistently multitask can actually hinder your ability to think deep and complex thoughts.

89
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It also can create a false sense of urgency, which prevents our brain's ability to transfer information into long-term storage.

90
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And from here, it becomes harder to accumulate memories.

91
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In summary, every minute distracted by your phone is a lost minute in the here and now.

92
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:56,000
This can leave behind a trail of forgotten experiences and damage the ability to formulate deep and complex thoughts and long-term memories.

93
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Moving on to number 2, addiction.

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Now this detrimental effect is more commonly known, but did you know that nomophobia is the real fear of being away from one's phone?

95
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:14,000
For heavy users, a study by Dr. Larry Rossin, the author of The Distracted Mind, revealed what a lack of smartphone access can do.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Participants in the experiment were strapped to sweat and heat monitors as they read a passage.

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Their phones were out of reach, but they could hear text notifications flooding in.

98
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The result was a spike in anxiety and a drop in reading comprehension.

99
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And this will affect more people as we're all using our smartphones more.

100
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Between 2019 and 2023, average mobile screen time shot up by 23% from 2 hours and 56 minutes to 3 hours and 46 minutes.

101
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The average user now checks their phones 96 times per day.

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Research from a peer-reviewed medical journal Psychiatry Research, Neuroimaging, confirms that excessive smartphone use presents itself a lot like addiction,

103
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
weakening vital brain networks that control things like paying attention and stopping impulses.

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This leads to withdrawal symptoms and continued use despite negative consequences.

105
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
There's a silent epidemic that we're neglecting.

106
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,000
One can imagine the impact, albeit to varying degrees, on the 6.84 billion smartphone users worldwide.

107
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
When you factor in the amount of developing brains that are using the devices, what will be the end result?

108
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
As smartphone use increases each year, even the smartphone's creators are questioning the monster that they've unleashed.

109
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Tony Fidel, who worked on the original iPhone team, says,

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
As a side, I've done a full episode on the story of the people who created the iPhone if you're interested.

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
But zooming out, we can't blame the phone manufacturers.

112
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
If you've watched the social dilemma, you would have seen former tech employees expressing a sense of regret regarding the designs of social media apps.

113
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We are increasingly glued to our phones.

114
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Just look at this 30 seconds we filmed outside Oxford Circus earlier today.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All the white flashes are the phones people are on.

116
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
So we've left them in that room.

117
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
We've said we've left a camera on record to film them getting on.

118
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
And now we're just going to leave them there and see how many times they look at their phone.

119
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Harry, you got your phone out after three minutes. Is that a surprise to you?

120
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It is a surprise to me actually because I didn't think I used technology that often.

121
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I didn't think I was that dependent on it.

122
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm surprised I lost in four minutes.

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The role of addictive design in social media has been well documented.

124
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Casino-like features like pull-to-refresh mimic slot machines and exploit the pleasure of anticipating rewards.

125
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And interestingly, this can trigger larger dopamine spikes than the rewards themselves.

126
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Also infinite scrolling and autoplay to lull a user into mindless behavior.

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But a silver lining is that since 2018, Apple and Google have built digital well-being features into their phones to prevent overuse.

128
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So the tools are there. People just have to use them.

129
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Number three, cognitive function.

130
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
A 2022 study found that our reading comprehension declines when we read from a screen,

131
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
even if the text is exactly the same as it is on paper.

132
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The chart you see now shows reading comprehension scores.

133
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The red is reading from paper, while the blue is reading from a phone.

134
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
In addition, as mentioned at the top of this episode,

135
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
the mere presence of your smartphone in the same room lowers your ability to focus, remember, and solve problems.

136
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
The phone doesn't even have to be switched on.

137
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Researchers at the University of Chicago call this brain drain.

138
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It happens because the human brain has a limited capacity to process information,

139
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
meaning we have to prioritize what we want to focus on.

140
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
When your phone is nearby, it competes for cognitive resources,

141
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and your brain must work extra hard to resist its temptation.

142
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
This sabotages your concentration on other tasks.

143
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So let's look at the experiment. It's remarkable.

144
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Quote, the researchers asked participants to either put their phones next to them so they were visible, like on a desk,

145
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,000
nearby and out of sight, like in a bag or pocket, or in another room.

146
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Participants then completed a series of tasks to test their abilities to process and remember information.

147
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Their problem solving, and their focus.

148
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They were found to perform far better when their phones were in another room instead of nearby,

149
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
whether visible, powered on, or not.

150
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That held true, even though most of the participants claimed not to be consciously thinking about their devices.

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
So it's an effect that happens even though we don't notice it.

152
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Quite fascinating.

153
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And finally, number four, stress.

154
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Smartphones aren't just changing our behavior.

155
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
They're affecting human biology, and the health risks can get pretty serious.

156
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Endocrinologist Robert Lustig warns that smartphone notifications have turned us all into Pavlov's dogs,

157
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
training our brains to be in a constant state of fear and stress.

158
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Here's how it happened.

159
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:05,000
1. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex are altered after exposure to a flood of neurotransmitters.

160
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,000
One common trigger of neurotransmitters to flood the brain is the anticipation of rewards, like the UIA on Instagram.

161
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
2. This can cause our prefrontal cortex, the brain's decision-making hub,

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
and emotional control center to go completely haywire and even shut down.

163
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And 3. When the prefrontal cortex shuts down, the amygdala, responsible for emotional regulation,

164
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
takes over, inducing stress and panic.

165
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
When our prefrontal cortex is overworked in this state, one's self-control can take a hit.

166
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Then to add to the pile, there's the information that we receive from social media.

167
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
From doom-scrolling to the creation of young hypochondriacs on TikTok,

168
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
self-diagnosing themselves into oblivion.

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The answer is yes, you have trauma.

170
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Procrastination is actually a short-term coping tool to avoid feeling anxiety or dread.

171
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A popular type of video on TikTok is five things you might not realize were a mental disorder,

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and it's really generic things like biting your nails or fidgeting or being a people pleaser.

173
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I just need to take an anxiety nap. Can you wake me up in like 30 minutes? I'm like not well.

174
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In a lot of this discussion, the problem isn't with the smartphones themselves, but social media use.

175
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And this was solidified by a 2023 global study of over 50,000 participants.

176
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But we have to stay level-headed.

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
There's research to suggest that about 30 minutes of daily social media is actually beneficial,

178
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
but going past about an hour can be detrimental.

179
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
One of the most impactful outcomes of smartphones has been the way we consume daily news.

180
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,000
For example, when OpenAI released GPT-40 last week, it might surprise you how different media covered the story in different ways.

181
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Take, for example, this story on the recent OpenAI Reddit content deal.

182
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The story was reported on by 55 news outlets.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
This left-leaning headline from Business Insider frames the story as one regarding big data concerns.

184
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
A right-leaning outlet focuses on the political orientation of Reddit users, as well as the monetary size of the deal.

185
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
So when someone's scrolling through a news feed that's tailor-made for them with news articles that confirm their bias,

186
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
they're unlikely to see the other side of the story outside of their bubble.

187
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And this is what the algorithms of today have created.

188
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So it's important to get the whole picture, and that's where today's sponsor, GroundNews, comes in.

189
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
GroundNews is a website and app developed by a former NASA engineer

190
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
who was on a mission to give readers an easy, data-driven, objective way to read the news.

191
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Every story comes with a quick visual breakdown of political bias.

192
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Factuality and the ownership of the source's reporting all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring organizations.

193
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
For example, let's go back to that story on the OpenAI Reddit deal.

194
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
On GroundNews, everything is organized to make it easy for you to see all the details.

195
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Their bias distribution shows you the political bias of the reporting outlets.

196
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Below, you can see the factuality information, as well as the ownership information.

197
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
For this story, 31% of reporting outlets are owned by media conglomerates.

198
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I especially like the bling feed, which highlights stories that are heavily covered by one side of the political spectrum.

199
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's important to utilize critical thinking and breakout of online echo chambers.

200
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If we know where these views are coming from, we're probably going to be better equipped to engage in constructive dialogue to those who hold different views.

201
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
GroundNews is a fantastic tool for sifting through the daily misinformation and bias.

202
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
They provide all the tools you need to be a critical thinker.

203
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000

206
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Now back to the video.

207
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
So what happens when people break away from smartphones completely?

208
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, fortunately, we have a slew of examples from those who are heavy smartphone users and decided to ditch them for a dumb phone.

209
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The way they describe their experiences is pretty interesting.

210
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Let's take a quick look at some testimonials.

211
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was not ready for how much I truly enjoyed this phone.

212
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I was present with my kids, with my wife, I was able to be reached by friends and family.

213
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
A bit about my experience.

214
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Just what is it like living without a smartphone?

215
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
For those of us who grew up in the 90s, I think there's a lot of nostalgia around that time.

216
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
And for me, a lot of that is about the fact that nobody had a smartphone or even a cell phone.

217
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:25,000
But I was surprised and excited to find that I could kind of reconnect with some of the benefits of that time through this experiment.

218
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I've been much more focused at work because all of my work now takes place in front of the computer.

219
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
So I'm much more intentional and focused when it is actually time to work.

220
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I have time for creative hobbies because I'm not scrolling through social media or news or anything on my phone.

221
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
My phone doesn't do anything fun and that means I have time to get bored.

222
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Have you ever been bored as an adult?

223
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't think I had until this experiment, but boredom equals creativity.

224
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
But then there were others and this group wasn't quite as sold on the dumb phone idea and quickly found themselves reverting back to a smartphone.

225
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Alright, so I'm nearly finished with this 30-day experiment and if I'm being completely honest, I cannot wait to get back to a smartphone.

226
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I entered this experiment really wanting it to work.

227
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Really wanting to find a phone that would give me all the tools I needed while removing the headaches my smartphone causes.

228
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But unfortunately, I don't know if I'm ready to make the switch full-time.

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Not having a camera, the spotty directions, and the clunky typing are the biggest deal-breakers for me.

230
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
This is the phone that you could literally only call with, which is great if that's all I needed,

231
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:40,000
but I'd have to be damn confident with my job security and friendships because I could see how easily I could lose connections and friendships due to my inability to respond.

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
There are more people giving dumb phones a try, so much so that some call it the anti-smartphone revolution.

233
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You can check out my podcast episode with Kai-Wai Tang, the co-founder of Lightphone, and I discussed this topic in depth with him.

234
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
So if you've gotten to this part of the episode, you're probably in one of three camps.

235
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
One, all of this information is new to you, or the second camp, you've heard some of this before and learned some new things.

236
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Or, even if you're one of those who have heard all of this before, I think it's important to remind ourselves.

237
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
But what about the bigger picture? What does all of this mean?

238
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It's insane to think that there's the possibility that hundreds of millions or even billions of people out there could have worse memory, worse concentration,

239
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
smaller grey matter, and increased anxiety due to chronic smartphone overuse.

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'm going to ask you, do you think this explains part of the world we live in today?

241
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Although it all sounds terrible, fortunately there are very practical things that can be done, as we've talked about.

242
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Number one, exercise. Two, avoid the overuse of social media.

243
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Three, stop multitasking. Four, if you want to increase comprehension, choose to read physical media instead of your phone.

244
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And five, if you want to improve memory, limit phone use for memory tasks where possible.

245
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
At the end of the day, the power is still in our hands.

246
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
So what's your opinion on all of this? Did this speak to you? Do you think you use your smartphone too much?

247
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Or do you think you've got everything under control? I'd love to hear from you in the comments.

248
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
So anyway, that is how your smartphone is rewiring your brain.

249
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000

Cheers guys. Have a good one.

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I feel I'm getting older all the time in the bay

254
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I feel I'm getting older all the time in the bay

255
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I feel I'm getting older all the time in the bay
