2320	5440	Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.
5440	10240	In 1770, Hungarian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kemplen
10240	15360	built an unveiled a self-operating chess-playing machine called the Mechanical Turk.
15360	21440	In demonstrations around Europe, his chess-playing invention won most of its games against actual human chess players
21440	26240	and it's even said that it went on to beat players like Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin.
26320	30160	Naturally, the invention was extremely popular, a marvel of its day.
30160	35040	However, it was actually just some guy under the table secretly operating the machine.
35040	36800	In other words, it was a hoax.
37680	42320	Some 250 years later, in 2016, Amazon pulled a similar stunt.
42320	47920	Their checkout system, called Just Walk Out, allowed customers to simply grab items from the store and leave.
48720	53120	Under this system, customers didn't have to manually scan their items at the checkout.
53120	58240	The transactions and logistics were automatically taken care of behind the scenes by AI.
58240	62800	An elegant combination of computer vision, sense of fusion, and deep learning.
62800	63440	Or was it?
64000	67440	Just like the Mechanical Turk, all was not as it seemed.
67440	72560	Amazon's so-called AI technology was actually powered by a thousand people in India
72560	75760	watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts.
75760	81040	Now, human's labeling data is often how AI models are first trained and that's fine.
81040	83680	But the point is, the advertising was misleading.
84320	90880	Even by 2022, these 1,000 people were still manually reviewing 70% of transactions
90880	96400	in 20 Amazon Go stores, 40 Amazon Fresh Grocery stores, and two Whole Foods stores.
98480	103040	Although some saw it as dystopian, Amazon promoted their Just Walk Out technology
103040	106240	as a utopian magical solution powered by AI.
106240	107920	And herein lies the problem.
107920	111280	Companies often leave out critical information in the fine print.
111280	116400	It wasn't until 2023 that Amazon mentioned the use of the 1,000 people in India.
116400	117600	And it gets worse.
117600	121680	According to a report by the information, other companies were swindled too.
121680	127600	Quote, 30 stores operated by other companies in the US, sports stadiums, 12 airports,
127600	131040	and one university all used Amazon's Walk Out technology.
132080	134080	And this is where things become murky.
134080	138000	When companies promise revolutionary technology, but don't follow up on them,
138000	143200	it creates distrust, but it can even spoil it for those who are doing legitimate work in the field.
143200	146400	With the AI revolution that we've seen over the past couple of years,
146400	149680	there needs to be a more critical look at what's happening with AI.
149680	153840	In this episode, we'll see the reasons for the AI hype and its consequences.
153840	158480	We'll look at if there is indeed an AI bubble and what real-world impact that might be having.
158480	161440	This includes companies releasing half-baked AI products,
161440	165120	but also simultaneously replacing actual humans with AI.
165120	169200	It's a dichotomy of an industry, so sit back and relax as we make sense of it all.
177360	180960	One use of AI technology that absolutely nobody is thrilled about
180960	183520	is the fact that it can make scammers' lives easier.
183520	187920	AI can help generate convincing texts that try to trick you into clicking a phishing link.
187920	190640	And then there's the spam emails and robocalls.
190640	193120	You've all experienced it, but why does it happen?
193120	195840	It's because your information has been sold to data brokers.
195840	199920	They're making a fortune from selling your information to robocallers and scammers.
199920	204320	They can know a lot about you, including your name, phone number, and address.
204320	208480	But there's a simple way to stop this. That's where today's sponsor, Aura, comes in.
208480	213040	They can identify data brokers and submit opt-out requests on your behalf.
213040	216640	Brokers are legally required to remove your information if you ask them to,
216640	218640	but they make it super hard to do.
218640	220080	Let Aura handle that for you.
220080	224880	Aura also does so much more to protect you and your family from online threats that you can't see.
224880	228480	It's really easy to set up, so you don't have to download several different apps
228480	233520	to get things like parental controls, antivirus, a VPN, password management,
233520	235520	identity theft insurance, and more.
235520	237760	And you get everything at one affordable price.

244800	245920	Okay, so let's continue.
249200	250880	No, it's not just you.
250880	254080	The term AI is really being thrown around everywhere.
254080	259040	For older Cold Fusion viewers, you'd know that I've been covering AI for the good part of a decade now.
259040	265520	Before 2022, the word artificial intelligence was limited to industry verbiage and obscure research papers.
265520	268240	The general public didn't know or care.
268240	274640	And even as late as 2021 when I covered GPT-3, there was a lot of people that thought I was just making it up.
274640	277360	How could a computer possibly talk like that?
277360	282640	Well, as you all know, after 2022, especially following the launch of chat GPT,
282640	283760	it was a different story.
284320	288080	From your smartphone to LinkedIn to your local government site,
288080	291760	a lot of organizations today will boast the term powered by AI.
293120	296800	While in a lot of cases it makes sense, the overuse of the term
296800	301520	and it being thrown around so casually is a symptom of something called AI washing.
301920	307200	AI washing, simply put, is when companies create a fake buzz and mislead investors by
307200	313280	providing manipulative information about the capabilities, limitations, or risks of their AI products,
313280	316960	or simply wholesale lie about how and when they're using AI.
316960	324640	According to Goldman Sachs, a record 36% of S&P 500 companies mentioned AI in their Q4 earnings reports.
324640	329840	If the biggest companies in the world are hyping it up, there's no doubt that smaller companies are following suit
330800	333680	and some without tangible results backing up their claims.
334240	336160	And the investments are there to match too.
336160	341680	From 2015 to 2022, global corporate AI investments have increased seven times.
342320	346000	A lot of companies have seen tremendous growth in the recent AI hype,
346000	349600	and this puts pressure on other companies to integrate AI into their business model
349600	351440	or their products in order to compete.
351440	353760	And that's even if it's not really AI.
353760	355440	Monkey see, monkey do.
356320	360800	For example, the Canadian investment firm, Delphia, claimed that it had built an AI to
360800	366160	predict upcoming companies and industry trends, despite not having any such capabilities.
366160	371600	The SEC caught wind of the scam and has since ordered them to pay US$225,000,
371600	375120	and this was for false advertising and misleading statements about the use of AI.
375120	377120	And I have a feeling that this is just the start.
378080	382960	I previously talked about the Wirecard fraud, where CEO Marcus Braun boasted about having
382960	386800	advanced proprietary AI throughout their fintech products and services.
386800	389680	In reality, it was just spreadsheets.
389680	392480	In the end, there was $2 billion missing from the books,
392480	394400	but that was a story for a different day.
394400	398080	You might have also heard about the NPU, or Neural Processing Unit.
398800	403280	It's a dedicated processor specifically designed for AI tasks, among other things.
404400	407680	They're becoming increasingly common in the world of PCs and laptops,
407680	412400	and Microsoft has even claimed that we're now in the age of the AI PC,
412480	416720	but recent reviews of the current crop of these products have left consumers with a bad taste
416720	417520	in their mouth.
417520	419520	Let's talk a bit more about AI.
419520	424560	Yes, the Snapdragon processors dominate here, but AI is still very nascent.
424560	427280	Many people either won't use these tasks or that much,
427280	430480	or these tasks themselves just don't work that well yet.
430480	433520	For example, they demoed generating images of animals,
433520	436720	and they highlighted how fast the processors were versus Intel.
436720	440640	But when I looked closely at the images generated, they were all garbage.
440640	443360	The AI dogs all had very lopsided eyes.
443360	446640	So who cares if one of these processors is faster than the other
446640	448640	if they are both generating garbage?
448640	453040	Right now, I just wouldn't advise anyone buy a laptop based on its AI capabilities.
453040	457280	A news analyst from Computerworld has mentioned that these AI PCs
457280	459440	aren't, quote, all they're cracked up to be.
459440	463280	And if you're expecting something transformative when you buy one from the start of 2024,
463280	464640	you're going to be disappointed.
464640	468960	They might one day deliver a lot of cool features, just not yet, end quote.
468960	472000	But are there consequences of such misplaced promises,
472000	474080	other than distrust from customers?
474080	478240	Companies that missed the mark with AI product launches are constantly trying to save face.
478800	482160	Even the most popular companies in the world are not immune to mistakes.
482960	486640	Perhaps the biggest consequence of AI washing is a certain B word
486640	488240	that might be lurking around the corner.
491280	495440	Almost as soon as AI started going Uber mainstream from late 2022,
495520	499280	a lot of people immediately likened the phenomenon to the dot-com bubble
499280	500960	or even the crypto fiasco.
500960	503200	In fact, some people still do today.
503920	505840	Even when we talk about the dot-com bubble,
505840	508000	it's not the world wide web that was the problem.
508000	510160	Because of course, you're using it right now.
510160	513920	Instead, it was mostly the e-commerce side of things which overpromised,
513920	517200	reeling in investors but under delivered, leading to a crash
517200	521040	when everyone realized that the companies that they invested in weren't making any money.
521040	526800	With AI, there's no doubt that we'll see some more investment in the space
526800	528160	and monumental growth too.
528800	531600	According to Oppenheimer, no, not the one you're thinking of,
531600	534880	who's a chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research,
536400	540320	we believe we are in the relatively early stages of a new technology cycle
540320	542480	that is likely to lead to further outperformance.
543440	547200	Nvidia, who designs the chips that are powering Big Tech's AI revolution,
547200	548800	is tentative proof of this.
548800	552800	Their stock is up 80% this year alone, perhaps excessive,
552800	555200	but it's indicative of what the market thinks of AI.
556080	558880	Mark Cuban, who made his fortune during the dot-com era,
558880	560720	also doesn't see AI as a bubble.
560720	562560	In a recent interview with Lex Friedman,
562560	565120	he expressed that the biggest sign that we're not in a bubble
565120	567280	is the lack of IPOs in the AI sector.
568000	571680	Also, the absence of companies with no intrinsic value going public
571680	575520	and the lack of, quote, funky AI companies is a key indicator.
575520	579200	He noted that the current market doesn't exhibit such characteristics,
579200	581200	and I think that I largely agree with that.
581200	583680	There's obviously some bad players in the industry
583680	585520	who are just trying to make a quick buck,
585520	588160	but there might be more to it, and here's what I mean.
588160	590480	There's a known pattern for emerging technologies
590480	592160	called the Gartner hype cycle.
592160	594560	It describes how humans tend to be overzealous
594560	596880	about a new revolutionary technology.
596880	599440	We overestimate and overshoot its impact,
599440	601440	hype it up until the market crashes,
602160	605680	and after the crash, the real companies with the real value
605680	608960	come through and spearhead the development of the new technology
608960	610160	until it's mature.
610160	612720	If we look at the Gartner hype cycle for AI,
612720	614800	it seems like we're at the closing stages
614800	617040	of the peak of inflated expectations
617040	619840	and are slowly entering the trough of disillusionment.
619840	621920	This interpretation of the current market
621920	624320	means that there's going to be a lot of disappointment ahead.
624320	628480	The real applications of AI will come after the hype and fatigue fades.
629120	631040	But this time could be a little bit different
631040	635280	because at its core, AI has the ability to mimic cognitive labour,
635280	638400	a change that no previous technology has been able to do
638400	640160	without intrinsic human intervention.
641040	644320	Whereas, as pointed out in a previous podcast episode,
644320	646560	during the dot-com bubble, there were a lot of people
646560	649120	simply making a random website and going public
649120	651120	and investors would throw money at anything
651120	652800	with a dot-com at the end of its name.
657040	658720	There's been a lot of organisations
658720	660800	that have been rushing to launch AI products
660800	663440	or replace humans with AI altogether.
663440	665920	But the ones who are hastily adding the ever-popular,
665920	668960	quote, powered by AI, gimmick, are failing badly
668960	671760	and there have been some spectacular AI failures.
671760	675040	For example, a parcel delivery firm called DPD
675040	677760	enabled an AI online chat for answering questions.
678320	680640	For one customer, it was not only useless
680640	683040	at answering relevant questions regarding his order,
683040	687200	but instead, when asked, it provided him with a poem and swore at him.
687280	690400	This amazing poem came forth about a DPD chat pot.
690400	693600	Who wasn't able to do anything? It was quite amazing.
693600	696080	It appeared to even disregard its own rules
696080	699680	and started swearing and even started dissing its own employer,
699680	703360	adding, DPD is the worst delivery firm in the world.
703360	705520	I would never recommend them to anyone.
706160	710240	In Australia, a group of academics used AI-generated material
710240	711680	as part of their complaint submission
711680	714880	to the Australian Parliament against four of Australia's biggest banks.
715600	718400	Of course, the AI made up a whole bunch of information,
718400	720480	including scandals that never existed
720480	724160	and implicating Deloitte when they had nothing to do with the original complaint.
724160	726320	Someone on the team didn't read the entire submission
726320	727920	before it went to the Australian Government,
727920	729360	so it was a huge embarrassment
729360	731200	and the academics were forced to apologise.
731920	733600	This is just one of many examples
733600	735120	and I'm going to include a website
735120	737200	that keeps a running tab of these AI blunders.
737840	740320	But on the other hand, there are companies
740320	742400	who are integrating AI successfully.
743120	746080	And this is where we come to the other kind of broken promise
746080	747360	when it comes to AI.
747360	750240	It's not CEO's over-promising AI's usefulness,
750240	751600	but under-promising instead.
752160	755440	In other words, we were told that AI would be our assistance
755440	757520	and create new jobs, not replace us.
758080	759440	But what if that's just not true?
760320	762320	Not about replacing the human in the loop.
762320	765040	In fact, it's about empowering the human.
765040	765920	It's an assistant.
765920	766560	It's an assistant.
766560	769120	This clip from Satya is a bit hard to believe now,
769120	771680	even though later he did mention the flip side.
771680	774800	Yes, I'm sure a lot of us use ChatGPT
774800	777200	to help get work done on personal projects,
777200	780560	but AI eventually creating more jobs than it would replace.
780560	781680	Maybe not so fast.
782720	785280	You may have noticed that since 2022,
785280	787600	there's been a lot of tech-related layoffs.
787600	789360	The narrative is that this is happening
789360	792080	due to the over-hiring during the pandemic times.
792080	795440	And that would make sense for 2022 and even 2023,
795440	798640	but in 2024, we're still seeing mass layoffs.
799120	801680	Now, if companies were just struggling to make a profit,
801680	805040	the explanation would be as simple as the common business cycle.
805040	807920	But strangely, some of the biggest companies in the world
807920	809280	are seeing record profits.
809280	811200	They're almost cyclically shedding workers.
812720	814000	According to reports,
814000	820320	tech companies fired 165,000 people in 2022, 260,000 in 2023,
820320	824960	and so far, the projection is 270,000 in 2024.
824960	826720	So if companies are doing fine,
826800	829120	why are workers being kicked out the door?
829120	832400	Well, marketing professor and author Scott Galloway thinks,
832400	835680	quote, there's something else going on, end quote.
835680	838800	In his recent blog post dissecting the impact of AI
838800	841440	on corporations, he mentions, quote,
841440	843600	AI is playing a larger role in layoffs
843600	846400	than CEOs are willing to admit, end quote.
846400	849760	The normal way we think about job replacements caused by AI
849760	852080	is that Joe Blogs is working at his computer,
852080	854320	analyzing company figures or something like that.
854320	857360	And then suddenly, the next day, he's replaced by an AI.
857360	860000	But the truth is, it's a bit more nuanced than that.
861120	863600	As companies slowly get better at understanding
863600	865680	how AI can aid in their operations,
865680	868640	they'll create better teams and structure with higher outcomes.
869360	872400	Basically, instead of three people doing the work of three,
872400	875440	you'll have one person doing the work of five with AI.
876080	878000	The problem is that none of these companies
878000	879200	are being sincere about it.
879760	882560	Because if you're a CEO and you've been hyping up AI
882640	884960	as the single greatest thing to happen to the industry,
884960	886480	and then you follow it up with a memo
886480	889040	that you've laid off 30% of your staff because of AI,
889040	890720	the hypocrisy becomes clear.
890720	894640	But in 2024, it seems like the truth is slowly coming out.
894640	896240	And there's hints everywhere.
896240	899360	IBM made headlines when CEO, Arvind Krishna,
899360	901440	mentioned that they're planning to pause hiring roles
901440	903280	that could be replaced with AI.
903280	906960	Same with UPS, where recently their CEO, Carol Tom,
906960	910080	acknowledged that AI is playing a part in employee layoffs.
910080	912880	And this came after UPS had the largest layoff
912880	916640	in its 116-year history, 12,000 workers.
917600	920800	In both cases, spokespeople later clarified saying,
920800	924400	quote, AI is not replacing workers, end quote,
924400	927120	which is basically PR talk to save face.
927120	929120	In fact, a Shopify employee
929120	930800	broke their nondisclosure agreement
930800	934240	to expose that the company has been secretly firing employees
934240	935280	because of AI.
935280	938880	The shift is even having an impact far outside the tech industry.
938880	941200	TV and media producer Tyler Perry
941200	944000	was building an $800 million studio expansion
944000	946640	but paused its construction after he saw the results
946640	949920	of open AISsora, an AI video generator.
949920	951760	He made the remark, quote,
951760	954480	I am very, very concerned that in the near future,
954480	957200	a lot of jobs are going to be lost, end quote.
959920	961520	In the last couple of years,
961520	963520	you probably would have heard this phrase a bit.
963520	965360	AI will not replace humans,
965360	968320	but humans who utilize AI will replace humans who don't.
968880	970320	There's definitely some truth to it,
970320	972960	but some jobs will be at risk regardless.
972960	974160	We don't have to imagine this.
974160	975360	It is already happening.
975360	976960	Megacaps like Meta and Alphabet,
976960	978880	they are shrinking their workforces
978880	980400	and shrinking their hiring.
980400	983920	It's this idea that senior AI researchers or data analysts,
983920	985760	they can do more with gen AI
985760	988480	than an army of junior engineers who code.
989280	991600	A recent report from McKinsey found that
991600	993440	around 12 million U.S. workers
993440	995600	may need to switch jobs by 2030.
995600	999360	Lower-wage workers are 14 times more likely to be impacted.
999360	1002560	STEM, healthcare, builders, and professional fields
1002560	1004160	will continue to add jobs,
1004160	1006720	but generative AI could change work significantly
1006720	1009360	for occupations like customer service and sales
1009360	1010320	and office support.
1011040	1013360	There's been repeated reports of how AI
1013360	1015120	will be adding hundreds of millions of jobs
1015120	1016080	in the next decade
1016080	1018320	and how it's going to positively impact GDP.
1018960	1021200	While by some miracle, this could happen.
1021200	1024160	Right now, as has been the case many times in history,
1024160	1026560	the train will leave the station without telling us.
1026560	1029360	Whether we're aware to jump on board or not is the question.
1032880	1034160	So wrapping this all up,
1034160	1036000	I do have to mention that in no way
1036000	1038000	am I saying that all forms of AI
1038000	1041120	and all of these giant corporations are elaborate hoaxes.
1041120	1042640	In fact, on this channel,
1042640	1044720	I've been making videos about AI progress
1044720	1046400	for the better part of a decade now,
1046400	1049520	and I've seen exponential progress right in front of my eyes,
1049520	1050880	and so will many of you.
1050880	1052400	We may have hit a temporary bottleneck
1052400	1053520	when it comes to compute,
1053520	1056240	but all it takes is a breakthrough in model efficiency
1056240	1057760	and the curve continues upwards.
1057760	1059040	But I just think that it's important
1059040	1060560	to still have a cautious approach
1060560	1062640	when it comes to looking at all sides of a story.
1063200	1064640	I'm also working on a video
1064640	1067680	that's all about the positive real-life impacts of AI,
1067680	1069600	so hopefully that's going to balance things out a bit.
1070880	1073360	So far, it seems like the promises of AI
1073360	1074880	are yet to be fully realized.
1074880	1077600	Whether that's creating and not taking jobs,
1077600	1079040	solving global issues,
1079040	1082240	or even providing us with a dependable AI customer service spot
1082240	1083520	that doesn't swear at us.
1083520	1085280	With such big and bold promises
1085280	1087040	from these companies over the years,
1087040	1089280	it's important for all of us to ask ourselves,
1089280	1091280	do we have technological gold,
1091280	1092560	a Trojan horse,
1092560	1094880	or a chess master hiding under a table?
1096880	1098720	Anyways, that's about it from me.
1098720	1099760	My name is DeGogo,
1099760	1101360	and you've been watching Cold Fusion.

1120720	1130000	Heaven help us make a better future.
1136000	1136880	Cold Fusion.
1137520	1138000	It's missing.
