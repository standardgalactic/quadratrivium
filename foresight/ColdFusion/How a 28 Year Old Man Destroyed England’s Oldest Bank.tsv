0	6240	Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.
6240	12040	Over 230 years, through world wars, the rise and fall of nations and industries, revolutions
12040	16200	and uprisings, Bering's Bank persevered.
16200	22400	Founded in 1762, Bering's Bank was an English institution associated with class, longevity
22400	27560	and strength, so much so that even the Queen of England had an account with them.
27560	33960	Then, in 1995, this grand banking legacy was destroyed, brought down by a single rogue
33960	36560	trader by the name of Nick Leeson.
36560	44360	So, let's explore how a 28-year-old from Hertfordshire was able to single-handedly destroy an institution.
44360	55360	You are watching Cold Fusion TV.
55360	59160	Nick Leeson was born in Wardford, Hertfordshire, to a middle-class home.
59160	61960	He was a confident but unimpressive student.
61960	66480	Despite his average educational performance, he was eventually able to secure a job with
66480	68200	Morgan Stanley.
68200	73680	He worked in their futures and options department, giving support to the traders on the frontline.
73680	79080	In 1989, two years after starting with Morgan Stanley, Nick Leeson approached his supervisor
79080	80720	and asked to be promoted.
80720	84760	Leeson wanted to be a trader and he felt that he deserved the promotion.
84760	89720	Unfortunately, his manager didn't agree and the request was turned down.
89720	94920	But Leeson knew what he wanted and, subsequently, he quit Morgan Stanley.
94920	99040	On his quest to become a stock trader, he would come across Bering's Bank and send in his
99040	100040	application.
100400	103480	Apparently, he'd never heard of the bank before submitting the application.
103480	107960	At that stage, I probably would be happy to say that I'd never heard of Bering's.
107960	111520	But it was a famous old bank.
111520	115720	So, there's no Bering's in Watford.
115720	117680	Bering's was no ordinary bank.
117680	120800	It catered to the most affluent class of people.
120800	123920	In the banking industry, the Bering's name was respected.
123920	127760	It was the safest of all banks and they could raise capital very easily.
128120	132000	Though, behind the scenes, its operations were struggling to keep up with the modern
132000	133840	banking world.
133840	138120	Leeson described the securities trading department of Bering's as being in stark contrast to
138120	140880	modern banks like Morgan Stanley.
140880	142320	Just a totally different environment.
142320	147160	There was, you know, Morgan Stanley, everything was new.
147160	149680	You know, all of the equipment was new.
149680	151360	The furniture was new.
151360	156120	At Bering's, everything is, you know, just tacky, I suppose.
156120	160200	I can't describe it any other way.
160200	164520	From his position as one of the bank's bookkeepers, it didn't take him very long to find flaws
164520	167240	in how the bank operated.
167240	171320	Bering's bank was crumbling during a time when most other financial institutions were
171320	172840	thriving.
172840	176560	Feeding on the good standing that comes with two centuries of global trading, it would
176560	179600	survive though, much like it always had.
179600	186600	But what Bering's wouldn't survive would be hiring Nick Leeson.
186600	191400	While many in the industry, including Leeson, possessed the intelligence to succeed, Leeson
191400	196680	also had a confidence and a way with people that he would wield like a secret weapon.
196680	200640	He was charming, friendly, and personable to his colleagues.
200640	202880	But not just for the sake of being polite.
202880	208320	He saw his co-workers, not as potential companions, but rather a means to an end.
208320	212920	Despite working at banks for multiple years, he never considered his co-workers his friends.
212920	217720	He did not like them, he did not respect them, but he knew that sometimes he needed them
217720	220560	to get what he wanted.
220560	226320	It's very easy for me to get on with people, but I don't necessarily have to like you
226320	229240	or any of the people that I work with to get on with them.
229240	234200	So I come in, I do my job, I do it to the best of my ability, and then at the end of
234200	237200	the day, if you're going to ask me out for a drink, I'm not going to go out for a drink
237200	240600	with you because I don't like you.
240600	245280	Nick Leeson impressed his superiors at bearings with his keen eye for identifying and solving
245280	247400	issues within the bank.
247400	252680	Not long into his employment, he was sent overseas to chase down massive sums of money.
252680	256960	These were debts that were long overdue, but never followed up on.
256960	260680	Bearing's bank had a habit of making deals that would fall between the cracks, and it
260680	265400	was Nick Leeson's fresh eyes that would hunt down these deals and claim back what the bank
265400	266800	was owed.
266800	271880	Leeson managed to find close to Â£100 million, the equivalent of twice of that today when
271880	273680	factoring inflation.
273680	278840	He describes this kind of mismanagement as being fairly typical for bearings.
278840	280560	Things were looking good for Leeson.
280560	285360	He was impressing his employees, and while in Jakarta, he met a fellow bearing staff
285360	288480	member by the name of Lisa Sims.
288480	292280	For the first time in his career, he found a colleague that he genuinely liked, and
292280	296520	in 1992, the two of them married.
296520	301360	But same month, his years of hard work finally paid off when bearings offered him the position
301360	302360	of a trader.
302360	307160	He would be in charge of a newly founded futures division in Singapore.
307160	311600	This was the opportunity that Leeson had been waiting for, and quite possibly, the worst
311600	316480	decision that bearings had ever made.
316480	322280	Approved to trade in Singapore, and having convinced his wife Lisa to move, it was go-time.
322280	327960	Being primarily on the Nikkei, Japan's top 225 company stock index, Nik thoroughly enjoyed
327960	332360	the stress and pressure of futures trading, essentially betting on if the price will rise
332360	333860	or fall.
333860	337120	If the market went the way he predicted, he made money.
337120	340280	If not, he rapidly lost money.
340280	345280	He was confident in himself and beloved by his staff, but later that year, the market
345280	350120	began fluctuating violently, and Leeson's team started making mistakes.
350120	354560	These bad bets were adding up, and if they weren't rectified, bearings stood to lose
354560	358280	large sums of money.
358280	362280	Out of the fear of losing the job that he worked so hard to obtain, and fuelled by his
362280	368860	own self-confidence, Nik decided to hide the losing bets from his employers back home.
368860	373160	In order to do this, he altered the software of a separate hidden account so that his bosses
373160	375680	in England couldn't keep track.
375680	379400	He named this account the 5 eighths account.
379400	384560	After Leeson kept his losing trades active, but hidden, he assumed that inevitably he'd
384560	387880	be able to cancel out the losses with future wins.
387880	392040	But there was only one problem with this, margin payments.
392040	396360	While the losing trades remained open, payments still had to be made in order to keep the
396360	397640	trades going.
397640	399760	He was going to need external funding.
399760	404600	He just needed enough money to keep the failed trades going, and when the market turned around,
404600	407520	he'd be home free.
407520	411480	Leeson would hide his mistakes, and then when the market went his way, he would fix his
411480	413680	mistakes in private.
413680	416880	Nik had to keep digging into a deeper pit of lies.
416880	422320	His bosses over in England could never find out what happened.
422320	426440	He asked his superiors for funds to cover stock futures that he'd bought for clients.
426440	429880	Only this time, the clients didn't exist.
429880	434040	Trusting that Leeson had the bank's best interests in mind, the branch over in England
434040	438400	happily sent him ever-increasing amounts of money, without ever thinking to double-check
438400	441120	where the money was actually going.
441120	444880	Surprisingly, for a time, the system worked.
444880	448600	Leeson described living with the lies as easy after the first two days.
448600	453840	From the first time I do anything, I'm not expecting to survive anything more than two
453840	454840	days.
454840	456320	To me, it's obvious.
456320	459560	If they can't see it after two days, then who says they're going to see it after two
459560	460560	hundred days?
460560	461560	Five hundred days?
461560	462560	A thousand days?
462560	466440	I don't get confident, but you're getting away with it.
466440	471480	As Nik Leeson continued to cover up his trading mistakes, Bering's itself was making massive
471480	475600	losses, and that was just the amount they knew about.
475600	478840	Something had to be done, so they recruited Peter Norris.
478840	482000	He was to oversee operations.
482000	486320	From the moment he began looking at the bank's records, Norris was shocked at what he found.
486320	488080	The books were a mess.
488080	492040	How shocked were you by the lack of control in that when you got in there and began to
492040	494240	work there?
494240	504720	I was shocked because I didn't feel that it should have been allowed to reach that point.
504720	508960	He saw a bank on the brink of collapse with ever-increasing debt and a loose grip on its
508960	512360	standing as a powerful player in the financial world.
512360	515400	He brought in a team to clean up the mess.
515400	519720	But the dire situation that shocked Norris was merely a fraction of the problem.
519720	526240	He was yet to find the hidden account in Singapore that would eventually collapse the entire bank.
526240	532720	Meanwhile, Leeson's plan to gradually cover his losses and emerge victorious had not gone
532720	533920	to plan.
533920	539920	By the end of 1992, his losses had only grown, now amounting to Â£4 million.
539920	542840	Seeing no way out, there was only one thing to do.
542840	545400	Gamble even harder.
545400	549320	Going against the bank's rules, he bought hundreds of additional futures in hopes of
549320	550920	covering his losses.
550920	554920	He bought so many orders that if the market was to move in his favour, it would completely
554920	556640	wipe out his debt.
556640	562360	He believed he could make his money back without anyone ever finding out what he had done.
562360	566400	At this point, he was struggling to sleep at night.
566400	568840	But surprisingly, it worked.
568840	572920	By July of 1993, he had covered his losses.
572920	578260	Leeson described the past nine months as a living nightmare, but he had done it and come
578260	581060	out relatively unscathed.
581060	585260	Unfortunately for all involved, Leeson had not learned his lesson.
585260	589620	In fact, what he had learned was how to commit fraud and get away with it.
589620	593900	Rather than take away a valuable lesson in risk management, Leeson saw an opportunity
593900	595620	to get filthy rich.
595620	599580	Nick was convinced by his past successes that he would eventually be able to trade out of
599580	604860	any amount of losses and maintain his reputation as an industry legend.
604860	607980	In his mind, he was a genius that had beaten the system.
607980	611380	But in reality, what had happened was just dumb luck.
611380	615820	Meanwhile, back in England, Bering's was recouping losses and the work of Peter Norris
615820	617500	was paying off.
617500	619660	Things were going well and the bank was recovering.
619660	626300	But the work wasn't over, so Bering's brought in a new head of in-house trading, Rob Baker.
626300	631220	Baker was a smart man and he valued tight oversight unlike his predecessors.
631220	635220	He was cynical of profits that couldn't be easily accounted for.
635220	639260	Because of this, Nick Leeson's department quickly caught his eye.
639260	643980	You see, Bering's bank was paying Nick Leeson to fund requests for new clients and they
643980	648340	noticed that some of these clients, who actually in reality didn't exist, were not keeping
648340	650780	up with their fees.
650780	660820	An internal audit was ordered and in July of 1993, the auditors flew to Singapore.
660820	666220	By the end of 1993, Leeson had found himself in the same trouble as last time, only this
666220	670300	time doubling up his strategy didn't work.
670300	674900	By the time Baker came face to face with Leeson, his secret account was now hiding losses
674900	677220	of 94 million pounds.
677220	681540	Nick would sometimes lose a million pounds in a single day.
681540	685940	Rob Baker saw through Leeson's confidence, recognizing a struggling and immature man
685940	688740	who didn't take too kindly to being overseen.
688740	694460	But what he could not have predicted was what was truly going on behind the scenes.
694460	696380	Leeson was now extremely worried.
696380	701020	He understood that if the auditors found just one document referring to the secret 5 eighths
701020	705540	account where his losses were hidden, his entire scheme would unravel.
705540	709860	But luck would be in his favor again, as the auditors surprisingly found nothing.
709860	726780	Leeson would later state that it was general incompetence from the bearing staff that allowed
726780	728860	him to go on undiscovered.
728860	731540	But Rob Baker has a different theory.
731540	735220	Nick was supposedly making the bank a bunch of money, so they didn't bother to question
735220	739780	the fact that Nick was both the head of Singapore Trading Operations and in charge of the Singapore
739780	740980	accounting.
740980	746180	And despite the strange accounts not paying any fees, bearings thought, hey, if it's
746180	751540	making us money, don't fix it.
751540	759340	By September of 1994, the secret 5 eighths account was hiding losses of 160 million pounds.
759340	762260	Leeson's fraud entered new levels of complexity.
762260	766860	He decided to use the secret account to buy futures from himself at extremely discounted
766940	770740	prices, allowing him to fake massive profits.
770740	775540	Nick was now in a deep, vicious, unsustainable cycle.
775540	780100	It could only continue so long as he had access to the fund that bearings would send him for
780100	781900	fake clients.
781900	784340	His life became a runaway train.
784340	789540	In secret, he was losing millions daily, but in public, he was becoming the star trader
789540	791260	that he always wanted to be.
791260	793940	Neither could exist without the other.
793940	798380	At this time, Leeson became known as the king of the exchange.
798380	804380	He was making a name for himself and had convinced the world that he was a success.
804380	808220	In December of 1994, Leeson was flown to New York.
808220	812980	Here, bearings held a traders conference and Nick was the star.
812980	817820	After all, according to the records, he had made the bank 28 million pounds that year
817820	818820	alone.
818820	822820	He was the poster boy of bearings bank and celebrated for a success.
822820	825540	But some of the other traders weren't as excited.
825540	829460	They had done their own maths and something didn't add up.
829460	833020	But the bearings bank executives paid no attention to these doubts.
833020	835220	The bank was on the way up.
835220	839220	It even got to the stage when Nick was asking for hundreds of thousands of pounds per day
839220	844860	for margin payments and without question, it was given to him.
844860	850860	By the end of 1994, based solely on lies, confidently told and expertly hidden, bearings
850900	859900	bank had transferred 75% of their entire capital into the hands of one man, Nick Leeson, 330
859900	861740	million pounds.
861740	865940	The pressure had become too much for Leeson and he had finally reached breaking point.
865940	868740	How could he live a lie so massive?
868740	872780	On a Christmas trip to Ireland, he told his wife that he did not want to return back to
872780	873780	Singapore.
873780	877740	But Leeson didn't understand why he would turn down such a great opportunity for their
877740	878740	family.
878820	881940	Nick couldn't bring himself to tell her the truth.
881940	884980	So he returned to Singapore in the new year.
884980	885980	Why lie?
885980	886980	I'm his wife.
886980	887980	Why should he lie?
887980	893860	I mean, I suppose lots of wives think that when they find out their husbands have been
893860	897740	having an affair and they think, well, you know, they've been leading a double life.
897740	898740	And that's what it feels like.
898740	906580	Not that Nick had an affair, it feels like Nick was leading a double life.
906580	910500	There was no economic or political factors impacting the Japanese market.
910500	914700	So Nick Leeson bet on stability and for a while it was working.
914700	918780	For a couple of weeks he was making a profit as the market remained steady.
918780	924100	If this kept going, his losses could be erased and he would be victorious once again.
924100	930940	But on January 17th at 5.46am, a massive earthquake struck the Japanese city of Kobe.
930940	934820	It killed 6,000 and displaced 45,000.
934820	940100	The Japanese Nikkei Stock Index, in which Nick was trading, absolutely crumbled.
940100	943260	It was bad, you know.
943260	945580	But again, it's living to fight another day, really.
945580	953380	I mean, you know, without the choice of running away from it, you know, I had to, bearings
953380	958140	were still paying me money, don't forget, they were still paying me masses of money,
958140	959140	you know.
959140	962180	I mean, we'd ask for sometimes for $100 million, they'd pay it.
962180	965020	With the market running away from him, he was desperate.
965020	969780	He made one final bet, buying thousands more futures contracts in an attempt to prop up
969780	971420	the market.
971420	976020	He was hoping that this move would be substantial enough to fight against the crash.
976020	977660	It was another failed gamble.
977660	983940	In a single day he lost a further Â£50 million, but he continued down this path.
983940	988780	He asked the bank for more money which they would provide on the basis of falsified profits,
988780	993740	fictitious profits manufactured from the secret 5 eighths account.
993740	997780	While bearings continued to believe Lee Sin's deception, they were happy with his falsified
997780	1000860	profits and trusted that he was doing well.
1000860	1004980	They believed that he was taking advantage of the chaotic market since the earthquake
1004980	1008420	and making huge sums of money for everyone involved.
1008420	1013980	At one stage, auditors found a Â£50 million loss that Nick forgot to hide.
1013980	1019420	Frantically, Nick forged a bank loan document with scissors and glue to cover it up.
1019420	1024300	Amazingly, the auditors believed the document, even though it had, from Nick and Lisa at
1024300	1028100	the top, the fax signature from their home machine.
1028100	1034620	Then, finally, after all the close calls, audits, unimaginable debt, and luck, both
1034620	1040100	good and bad, Lee Sin's time was up.
1040100	1045060	On the 17th of February, a single clerk in Singapore noticed some discrepancies in Lee
1045060	1048300	Sin's accounts and brought them to his attention.
1048300	1052980	After failing to deflect the clerk's enquiries for a week, he knew that this time he couldn't
1052980	1055140	make this one go away.
1055140	1059340	Feeling that the walls were finally closing in, Nick told the clerk that his wife was
1059340	1060340	unwell.
1060340	1063700	He had to go and visit her, and he'd be back in 45 minutes.
1063700	1066540	Of course, this was a lie.
1066540	1070380	Nick frantically rushed home to collect his wife, packed up his belongings, and they both
1070380	1075020	drove to the airport and boarded a flight to a luxury resort in Malaysia.
1075020	1079500	That week, with Nick gone and not being able to provide any more distractions, the bearings
1079500	1083900	officers from London were finally able to access one of Lee Sin's accounts.
1083900	1085740	It was a horrific disaster.
1085740	1089340	They knew straight away that bankruptcy was inevitable.
1115740	1127860	Bearings appealed to England's central bank for support.
1127860	1131860	They were desperate for a bailout before the markets opened again on Monday.
1131860	1132860	But it was impossible.
1132860	1139900	Lee Sin's losses had multiplied to 830 million pounds, the equivalent of US$2 billion today.
1139900	1143220	It was clear that the bank couldn't be saved.
1143220	1149380	After two long centuries of banking, bearings collapsed.
1149380	1155500	On the 20th of November 1995, Lee Sin was arrested in Germany and extradited to Singapore.
1155500	1159700	He was charged with two counts of deceiving the bank's auditors and of cheating the Singapore
1159700	1161180	exchange.
1161180	1166020	He received a six and a half year prison sentence, but he was released after four years for good
1166020	1170140	behaviour.
1170140	1174820	In all of this, Lee Sin maintains a dismissive and blameless attitude towards the events
1174820	1176100	that caused the crash.
1176100	1179820	In his mind, the fault lies with those who ran bearings and not him.
1179820	1184740	Why didn't those people who ran bearings come to you and say, what are you doing?
1184740	1185740	Because they're stupid.
1185740	1189500	They don't understand the business and they should never have been in the position that
1189500	1192780	they were in, especially people like Tony Hawes.
1192780	1196580	He was supposed to be controlling the global treasury function.
1196580	1199740	He was supposed to understand derivatives.
1199740	1200740	He didn't.
1200740	1206860	And he would pay the money every single day and would accept pretty ridiculous explanations
1206860	1207860	from me.
1207860	1208860	It wouldn't happen at Morgan Stanley.
1208860	1213860	At bearings, they had a lot of idiots basically in every one of the controlling functions.
1213860	1219260	And you were creating a large amount of profits?
1219260	1221020	Fictitiously, yeah.
1221020	1226660	It's a complete amazement, but as you get to know the people at bearings, you can then
1226660	1227660	understand the amazement.
1227660	1230940	A lot of them are just bumbling fools.
1230940	1235420	Although his arrogance is distasteful, the law was inclined to agree with him.
1235420	1239500	The courts found bearings to be responsible for the deficit in internal auditing and risk
1239500	1240500	management.
1240500	1243420	Their carelessness allowed the fraud to spiral out of control.
1243420	1247420	But this shouldn't distract from the fact that hordes of people lost their jobs and
1247420	1250820	their money during the bearings' failure.
1250820	1256260	In the fallout from the collapse, Dutch bank ING bought bearings for a single pound.
1256260	1258620	They later sold off various assets.
1258620	1264340	Today, bearings exists only as a cautionary tale, a lesson to banks across the globe that
1264340	1270380	accountability and careful oversight comes before blind trust and the thrill of profit,
1270380	1277780	and a reminder to long-standing institutions that nothing is eternal.
1277780	1281380	Lyssen's life has been consistently strange since his imprisonment.
1281380	1285060	Being somewhat of a household name for older generations, he has dipped in and out of the
1285060	1315020	public eye, even competing in the 2018 season of Celebrity Big Brother.
1315020	1320540	So that my friends is the wild and twisting story of Nick Lyssen, a story of how one man
1320540	1327020	got himself into an ever deeper hole until he destroyed the oldest bank in England.
