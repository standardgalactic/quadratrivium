0	8880	Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.
8880	14000	With all seen and read reports of Ponty scheme scandals getting exposed, the details always
14000	19000	talk about a significant number of people who have lost their savings in these schemes.
19000	24920	But even after investigations, arrests and sentences, new scammers will pop up and keep
24920	28800	doing the same thing over and over again.
28800	32800	But what exactly is a Ponty scheme and what are the science to look out for and how can
32800	34360	you protect yourself?
34360	37800	And what are the biggest Ponty schemes of all time?
37800	41600	You might be surprised to find out that the US government might be running the biggest
41600	45880	Ponty scheme in history according to some economists, so stay tuned till the end of
45880	48800	the episode to learn about that one.
48800	58080	Let's get into it.
58080	60920	But first of all, what is a Ponty scheme?
60920	63320	A Ponty scheme is an investment fraud.
63320	68360	The scheme promises high and sometimes quick returns, but in reality it's just paying
68360	73680	off existing investors with funds collected from new investors who have also been fooled,
73680	76560	fooled by the promise of a quick buck.
76560	81120	Ponty schemes use money from their new investors to pay off old investors while taking a cut
81120	82920	for themselves.
82920	87600	Since there is no money being earned by selling a product or a service, Ponty schemes require
87640	90640	a constant flow of new money to sustain.
90640	95960	Not surprisingly, after a time, it becomes increasingly harder to find new investors,
95960	102000	and when that happens, the scheme fails.
102000	105560	A Ponty scheme is not to be confused with a pyramid scheme.
105560	110440	A pyramid scheme requires recruitment to bring in more people to increase their returns.
110440	113560	A Ponty scheme may or may not need that.
113560	118600	For example, a Ponty scheme would be something like BitConnect, a fake cryptocurrency that
118600	123760	promised huge returns from a mysterious AI trading algorithm, but in reality, it used
123760	127080	money from old investors to pay off new investors.
127080	131960	And let me tell you that we are really changing the world as we know it.
131960	134960	The world is not anymore the way it used to be.
134960	137960	No, no, no.
138360	142360	BitConnect!
142360	144360	Wow!
144360	149760	Thousands of victims swindled out of more than $2 billion may be receiving some justice
149760	152960	after one of the leaders of a crypto scheme pleaded guilty.
152960	156440	This is believed to be the biggest cryptocurrency fraud ever charged criminal.
156440	160560	He says this scam, run through a crypto lending program called BitConnect, is believed to
160560	165120	have swindled thousands of people around the world out of more than $2 billion worth
165120	166280	of Bitcoin.
166280	170320	They claimed that if you traded your Bitcoin for their cryptocurrency, crypto currency
170320	175160	called the BitConnect coin, that a trading bot would make sure that you didn't lose
175160	176160	any money.
176160	181600	Also, offering investors returns as high as 40% per month, but prosecutors say BitConnect
181600	186720	actually operated like a Ponzi scheme, using investor funds to repay other BitConnect
186720	187720	investors.
187720	192200	A pyramid scheme, on the other hand, relies heavily on recruiting.
192200	196160	So something like Metabolife, where members would sell supplements and take a cut of the
196160	199920	sales of those who they recruited, forming a pyramid.
199920	205560	Now, have you ever wondered why an unusual word like Ponzi is associated with financial
205560	206560	fraud?
206560	213360	Its name is as such, because it's named after a man named Charles Ponzi.
213360	215560	So who was Charles Ponzi?
215560	221680	Charles Ponzi was a swindler, known for starting a scheme of this kind in 1920 in Boston.
222560	225440	Charles Ponzi was born in 1882 in Italy.
225440	229400	As a young boy, he kept stealing from the church so much that his family got sick of
229400	232720	him and deported him to America in 1903.
232720	237080	Charles worked in a restaurant as a waiter, but continually shortchanged the customers,
237080	240520	keeping the difference so he was fired.
240520	245080	In 1907, he moved to Canada and because of his skills with numbers, he got employed at
245080	246080	a bank.
246080	250040	Here, he would forge the signatures of clients and cash their checks.
250040	253400	He was caught and spent three years in prison.
253400	257600	After his release, Charles went back to the US and started up a scheme to smuggle Italian
257600	259920	immigrants from Canada to the US.
259920	263520	Again, he was caught and jailed for two years.
263520	268480	This time when he got out, he went to Boston and in November of 1919, he came across the
268480	270720	idea for his grand scheme.
270720	276440	Supposedly, this was achieved by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and
276440	281600	redeeming them at face value in the US where the currency was much stronger.
281600	290280	He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days or 100% profit within 90 days.
290280	296960	In 1907, an international postal congress had agreed to issue postal reply coupons throughout
296960	299080	the world.
299080	304280	The bearers could redeem these international coupons for postage stamps in their local
304280	306360	country.
306360	308440	This was to address a real problem.
308440	313240	Immigrants who came to America could afford to buy stamps, the relatives who stayed home
313240	314240	could not.
314240	319960	This was a way to allow relatives back home to write back to the family in America.
319960	325520	If you went to a European post office with American dollars and bought postal reply
325520	331240	coupons and then brought them to this country and cashed them in, you got US postage many
331240	336120	times more valuable than the US money you spent for them.
336120	338400	This was the premise.
338400	344200	Ponzi believed that for every dollar of postal reply coupons purchased, he could earn $5 when
344200	346760	he redeemed them for stamps.
346760	352800	With a 400% profit from these initial purchases, Ponzi would buy additional coupons and redeem
352800	355360	them for even more money.
355360	358920	It seemed to be a proposition that couldn't lose.
358920	363160	The only issue with this plan was that Ponzi would need to employ people to line up and
363160	368000	collect coupons and stamps, gather them up and ship them overseas, so this would probably
368000	371360	cost more than the money generated from the scheme itself.
371360	376720	So Charles Ponzi decided to buy no coupon stamps at all and just tell people that the
376720	378440	scheme would make them rich.
378440	381520	Double your money in three months.
381520	387160	America was booming in 1920, so people were all looking for a quick way to get rich.
387160	391760	Wild financial speculation was all the rage, so Ponzi fit right in.
391760	396200	He was charismatic and had a gift for talking, so everyone wanted a piece of the pie and
396200	398360	word quickly spread around.
398360	402480	Some people would take out their life savings from a bank to invest with Ponzi.
402480	407920	But the thing was, Ponzi would actually pay back investors as promised, so the whole thing
407920	411040	seemed legitimate and people went crazy.
411040	417680	By March of 1920, investors had thrown in $400,000, but Ponzi owed them $600,000 because of the
417680	419760	promises of his scheme.
419760	423560	Most people trusted him so much that they kept their money in so they could earn even
423560	424560	more.
424560	429080	Because of this, Charles could always make the payments when they came due.
429080	435560	Two months later in May, investors had thrown in $1.6 million, and by July, this had swelled
435560	442200	to $41 million, but at this stage, Charles owed $55 million, and that was the problem.
442200	446560	The more money Charles Ponzi received, the more in debt he was.
446560	451200	If he promised to double everyone's money, he would just be owing more and more.
451200	454120	All of this didn't matter though, as long as everyone didn't want their money out
454120	455720	at once.
455720	460720	Soon, Ponzi was averaging $3.4 million a day.
460720	466280	He bought himself a $7 million home with a heated pool and air conditioning, absolutely
466280	468920	unheard of in 1920.
468920	472720	He bought the very same shipping firm when he smuggled Italian immigrants just so he
472720	475080	could fire his old boss.
475080	479600	Six months ago, he was broke, but now he could have anything he wanted.
479600	484400	Massive crowds were growing outside of Ponzi's office, and officials got suspicious.
484400	487840	Police were called in to investigate, but after they talked to Charles Ponzi, two of
487840	490200	the three officers ended up investing.
490200	495640	In fact, a quarter of Boston's police force were investing with Charles Ponzi.
495640	500760	On the 26th of July, a Boston newspaper ran the first critical story of Ponzi.
500760	506280	It stated, if Ponzi could make 300% profit for his investors, why does he put his money
506280	509320	in the bank where it would only make him 2% or 3%?
509320	512080	Why not just invest all the money with himself?
512080	514880	It was a good point.
514880	517800	And another article stated that the numbers didn't add up.
517800	522480	There would have to be 160 million of these coupons circulating to amass such profits,
522480	527320	but in reality, there's only about 27,000 of these in the world, and there was also
527320	531000	no reports of massive purchases of coupons.
531000	535840	When these news articles broke, there was a massive panic, a riot ensued at Ponzi's
535840	536840	office.
536840	542640	$27 million were withdrawn in two days, but Ponzi could afford to pay everyone back,
542640	547880	and he did it with a smile while serving people coffee and donuts as they lined up.
547880	551920	Nerves were calmed, and people actually reinvested.
551920	553600	But it wouldn't last.
553600	556840	Government regulators and more bad press came Ponzi's way.
556840	560840	The latter of which stated he was completely bankrupt.
560840	564920	It started another panic and a rush for people to get all of their money out.
564920	570600	Over $200 million had been invested, but Ponzi was short $110 million.
570600	574600	Everyone tried to get their money out at once, and he couldn't pay.
574600	578520	By August of 1920, he was all over.
578520	583040	Ponzi wasn't dieted on 86 counts of fraud, and many investors lost everything.
583840	588080	It was a massive lesson for them, and us, to never just follow the crowd, and always
588080	589920	do your research before investing.
593920	598600	Even though Charles Ponzi got convicted and jailed for his deceit, it did not deter others
598600	600760	from coming up with such schemes.
600760	605040	So why do people keep falling for it?
605040	608520	Almost everyone wants to earn easy money, and get rich.
608520	612280	In the real world, this usually means that you need to work hard for it, but it's a
612280	614920	human tendency to look for shortcuts.
614920	620280	But taking shortcuts often leads to trouble, as is with the case with Ponzi schemes.
620280	624640	But it's not necessarily greed that attracts people towards them.
624640	628840	Ponzi schemes are designed in such a way that they appear legitimate.
628840	633120	Investors may genuinely see it as a promising avenue for investment.
633120	636920	Later on in the episode, we'll take a look at some warning signs to watch out for when
636920	641040	deciding if an investment is a Ponzi scheme or not.
641040	645440	The organisers of this kind of fraud usually target those who have spare money, or those
645440	649720	who need money, both are looking for quick and high returns.
649720	654680	Usually, the unemployed, all those coming from a financially weak background, fall prey
654680	656120	to these schemes.
656120	661720	Essentially, it all boils down to how convincingly the Ponzi organiser can fabricate a story,
661720	668640	a story of quick and assured success, playing on the ambitions, dreams, financial situation,
668640	670920	and financial literacy of people.
670920	675560	Emotions can often overthrow logic, so people end up believing that they're being helped
675560	679160	when they're actually being conned.
679160	683560	So let's take a look at five of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history.
683560	691040	Number one, the $593 million fraud by a Minister of Scientology, Reid Slatkin.
691040	694640	Reid Slatkin would start his scheme in 1986.
694640	699160	He would get people, including some very high profile names and many other Scientologists,
699160	703760	to invest in what was an unlicensed, quote, investment club.
703760	708600	He would pay out large sums of money to investors, claiming that his investment were working.
708600	713280	But again, in reality, he was just doing that old method of using new investor funds to
713280	715000	pay off the old investors.
715000	721280	He scammed around 800 investors for more than $593 million across 15 years before being
721280	722280	caught.
722280	728360	He admitted to fraud in 2002 and was jailed for 14 years.
729360	733160	Number two, the $1.2 billion fraud by Scott Rothstein.
733160	736880	Scott Rothstein started inviting investors into his Ponzi scheme.
736880	742080	He claimed to purchase highly confidential legal settlements using his law firm.
742080	748420	Rothstein's legal specialty is suing for sexual harassment, a down and dirty game where defendants
748420	753040	pay big money to settle lawsuits quickly and quietly.
753040	756320	Those are usually paid out over a long period of time.
756320	761480	Rothstein used wealthy investors to pay his clients up front, promising the investors
761480	764120	a big return on their money over time.
764120	769240	In some cases, it was a promise of more than 200%.
769240	774640	I was shown what a confidential settlement agreement looked like, and it had all the
774640	776520	information was blacked out.
776520	780800	It had the name of the plaintiff, the name of the defendant was blacked out, the attorney
780800	782600	was blacked out.
782600	783600	Everyone was blacked out.
783600	787320	If you want to be able to invest in something that couldn't be verified, I didn't even know
787320	788320	if it was real.
788320	791000	In fact, I didn't even think it was real.
791000	796800	The idea is a bonanza attracting big money players like a modern day gold rush.
796800	799160	We three kings be stealing the gold.
799160	805880	Scott ran with movie stars, rock stars, kid rock, Pam Anderson, athletes, superstars,
805880	809120	Dan Marino, Alonzo Morning, Sarah Palin.
809120	814640	There was pictures in his office of him shaking hands with Jeb Bush and George Bush.
814640	818800	From forging documents with judge's signatures to making corrupt law enforcement officers
818800	823520	to do his bidding, Scott often went to great lengths to sustain his fraud.
823520	827800	People in the community were always asking, how are they growing so fast?
827800	829560	Where does that money come from?
829560	833440	And I would always say, I don't know, but not from the practice of law.
833440	839080	We were offered 207% return, and I wanted to see how much money you need to invest to
839080	840080	get rich.
840080	850160	I calculated if you keep in $150,000 for 13 years, that $150,000 turns into $21 trillion.
850160	856120	That's enough to pay off the entire deficit of the United States and have more money beside.
856120	858520	He started off with hundreds of thousands of dollars.
858520	861720	He had to return millions, then tens of millions, then hundreds of millions.
861720	865840	So it had to collapse, there was no way to go forward.
865840	869320	He ran out of funds to pay investors by early 2009.
869320	873840	He raised an extra $100 million investment, but that still wasn't enough to keep the scheme
873840	874840	afloat.
874840	879800	When he knew his time was up, he fled to Morocco, but soon returned to the US, and was arrested
879800	880800	at that point.
880800	885960	Tempers Flare, it's a wrestling match of sorts outside of Florida courtroom, this after Scott
885960	890960	Rothstein, who has ties to Rhode Island, pleads guilty to a billion dollar Ponzi scheme.
891840	898360	He pled guilty in court and was sentenced to 50 years in jail in 2010.
898360	899360	Number 3.
899360	902960	The $3.7 billion fraud by Tom Pettis.
902960	908240	Businessman Thomas J. Pettis was convicted of male fraud, wire fraud, money laundering
908240	913080	and conspiracy for the operation of a $3.7 billion Ponzi scheme.
913080	917520	Thomas convinced investors that by putting money into his organization, they would fund
917600	922880	the purchase of retail merchandise that would then be sold to discount retailers for a profit.
922880	926280	However, no such investments were ever made.
926280	930400	The funds were diverted for other purposes, such as paying off those who helped organize
930400	935320	the fraud and also financing Scott's extravagant lifestyle.
935320	939240	This is how Pettis was able to manage his scheme at PCI.
939240	944360	First you need to ask yourself how to store such as Walmart, Costco, Best Buy and other
944480	948400	big box retailers sell merchandise so cheaply.
948400	954240	One answer is found in a little known industry known as diverting or supply chain management.
954240	958120	In today's market, many retailers do not like to keep a large inventory.
958120	961360	Instead, they buy products as they have a need to sell.
961360	964720	This concept is called just-in-time retailing.
964720	968480	To keep their prices down, they reach out to a middleman.
968480	970720	Pettis was a master diverter.
970720	973200	Here is how his program worked.
973200	976520	He brought on board investors to finance the deals.
976520	980000	Their money was put in a lock box account for safekeeping.
980000	984360	The money was then funneled through a business called Nationwide, where they would buy merchandise
984360	990800	from closeouts or stores going out of business in bulk for low prices.
990800	996720	Eventually they were able to buy large lots of inventory directly from the manufacturer.
996720	1001240	Next, the merchandise was shipped to a warehouse where it was held until a deal could be made
1001280	1007360	where it would be sold at a higher price to a retailer.
1007360	1012320	The retailers would still save money by not having to maintain such large inventories.
1012320	1017000	Ultimately, the money from the investment would go back to Nationwide, where they would
1017000	1021440	take their cut and the investors' money would be put back into the lock box, where they
1021440	1024000	would get their return on their investment.
1024000	1029520	This was a very lucrative deal for everyone involved.
1029520	1033240	The problem was, at some point, Pettis stopped buying merchandise.
1033240	1037560	The warehouses were empty and nothing was being sold.
1037560	1041880	All the returns investors were making were coming from the new investors, with Pettis
1041880	1045680	taking a cut off the top for himself.
1045680	1050280	The scam was reported to the authorities by one of his co-conspirators in 2008, and he
1050280	1052520	was arrested soon afterwards.
1052520	1059400	He was convicted in December of 2009 and was sentenced to 50 years in prison.
1060280	1063920	The Seven Billion Dollar Fraud by R. Allen Stanford
1063920	1067680	Allen Stanford was among the wealthiest men in the US.
1067680	1071760	He built the lavish lifestyle from banking and smooth talk.
1071760	1074600	But his slick sales pitch turned out to be a lie.
1074600	1079080	Stanford ran one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in American history.
1079080	1082040	That isn't until his House of Cards collapsed.
1082040	1086840	R. Allen Stanford, the chairman of Stanford Financial Group, orchestrated a seven billion
1086840	1092600	dollar fraud by selling certificates of deposits via his company's offshore bank in Antigua.
1092600	1099080	He cheated 30,000 investors from a few dozen countries and pocketed some of the proceeds.
1099080	1103840	He used the money to gamble in business ventures, acquire dubious real estate deals, and even
1103840	1105880	on cricket tournaments.
1105880	1110200	He got a little bit friendly with the player's wives and girlfriends.
1110200	1111360	We can see some pictures of this.
1111360	1113760	The English player's not particularly pleased.
1113760	1116960	That's Matt Pry's wife sitting on his knee.
1116960	1120320	And there was just a little bit of disquietment.
1120320	1125720	The England players, when they saw the behavior of Sir Allen Stanford with their various wives
1125720	1130000	and girlfriends, the Daily Mail has picked up on this and has that very picture with the
1130000	1135960	England player's fury at Stanford's antics with the wags turning into an ego-fueled fuss
1135960	1139080	saying the players were gobsmacked.
1139080	1140760	Is it fun being a billionaire?
1141160	1149560	Well, yes, I have to say it is fun being a billionaire, but it's hard work.
1149560	1154640	But as they say, behind every great fortune is a great crime.
1154640	1157760	Certificates of deposit were Stanford's bread and butter.
1157760	1162320	They were like buying a savings bond and customers thought they were insured.
1162320	1164760	Stanford became a catchphrase for safe.
1164760	1170040	So what he did was he went out and sold certificates of deposit to investors.
1170040	1171040	They bought them.
1171040	1173760	He would pay them interest.
1173760	1176840	And he paid the interest from the new investors.
1176840	1180920	Banks are supposed to take certificate of deposit money and put it in safe investments,
1180920	1184920	getting a small return, which they then used to pay their investors.
1184920	1188560	Providing investors with a solid return on their investment.
1188560	1190360	Stanford didn't do that.
1190360	1194360	He used new investors' money to pay the interest to the old investors.
1194360	1197200	In other words, a classic Ponzi scheme.
1197200	1201440	So a classic, no real underlying investment that's making money.
1201440	1205880	And what he did in the meantime was take money out of the bank and spend it on his lifestyle.
1205880	1210760	Stanford promised approximately 3% higher returns than similar investments sold by other
1210760	1211760	banks.
1211760	1217640	A profit that made Alan Stanford certificates of deposit attractive to investors.
1217640	1222400	Stanford said he could promise those higher returns because his bank was run smarter and
1222400	1225320	more efficiently than other banks.
1225320	1230400	Investors were not supposed to ask too many questions about where the money was invested.
1230400	1233840	People say, how in the world has this business of yours grown Alan?
1233840	1237680	I say, well simply because we do things differently, many times we do them the way they used to
1237680	1239920	do them 20 years ago.
1239920	1243840	But at least one employee, Charles Haslett, did start asking questions.
1243840	1248800	In fact, every time I brought up anything in meetings, everybody was looking at me very
1248800	1249800	shocked.
1249800	1252200	But do you think people didn't ask questions because the money kept flowing?
1252200	1253200	Sure.
1253200	1254200	A blind ignorance.
1254200	1256760	I didn't see any substance.
1256760	1259920	I talked to the manager of the bank.
1259920	1263040	He didn't seem to know a lot about banking in general.
1263040	1267480	On being arrested, Stanford denied all 14 allegations.
1267480	1273960	In March 2011, he was convicted on 13 of 14 counts and was sentenced to 11 years in prison.
1273960	1279660	And a U.S. judge called Alan Stanford's operation one of the most egregious criminal frauds ever
1279660	1282920	presented to a trial jury in federal court.
1282920	1288560	His arrest meant the end of almost two decades of illegal financial activity.
1288560	1292760	Number five, the $20 billion fraud by Bernie Madoff.
1292760	1297720	Bernie Madoff was the organizer of the largest realized Ponzi scheme in history as former
1297720	1302160	chairman of the Nasdaq stock market and his squeaky clean image of an investment guru.
1302160	1307520	He attracted several high profile clients such as film director Steven Spielberg.
1307520	1311240	But his fraudulent investments were exposed in 2008.
1311240	1316680	His Ponzi scheme wiped out people's fortunes and more than 15,400 claims were filed against
1316680	1317680	him.
1317680	1321760	He became so hated that he had to wear a bulletproof vest to court.
1321760	1326680	In March of 2009, Madoff pled guilty to the charges and the courts stripped him and his
1326680	1328200	wife of their wealth.
1328200	1333880	He was sentenced to jail for 150 years where he passed away in April of 2021.
1333880	1337400	If you want to see the full story on Bernie Madoff, you can check out the Cold Fusion
1337400	1338920	episode on him.
1339680	1342720	Okay, I said I'd say five, but here's a bonus one.
1342720	1346800	Number six, the entire US Federal Reserve System.
1346800	1351160	According to some economists, the entire US Federal Reserve System is a Ponzi scheme.
1351160	1353600	Here's the oversimplified version.
1353600	1357400	The United States has a huge national debt which is owed to foreign countries such as
1357400	1358880	China and Japan.
1358880	1363720	These countries and other investors loan the US government money in exchange for a stable
1363720	1364880	return.
1364880	1369040	These debts are short term debts, so the US government has to pay back these investors
1369040	1370640	trillions yearly.
1370640	1375160	Currently, the United States can't pay because they don't produce and export enough goods
1375160	1377320	to support their spending.
1377320	1382200	So, whenever the debt expires, the government either creates more money through the Federal
1382200	1387640	Reserve or borrows more money from new investors to pay off the old debt.
1387640	1391760	In essence, they're borrowing money from new investors to pay off the old investors,
1391760	1393920	just like Bernie Madoff.
1393920	1399160	In fact, in jail, Bernie Madoff even said the US government is running the biggest Ponzi
1399160	1403920	scheme on earth, and he would know a Ponzi scheme if he sees one.
1403920	1405680	He's not the only one, though.
1405680	1407080	Michael Snyder wrote,
1407080	1410600	The Fed is the biggest Ponzi scheme in the history of the world, and if the American
1410600	1415000	people truly understood how it really works, they would be screaming for it to be abolished
1415000	1417000	immediately.
1417000	1419200	And Michael Lombard stated,
1419200	1424640	Right now, we are seeing the government hoping investors would keep reinvesting in US bonds
1424640	1428880	while the Fed picks up the slack, but what happens if they say, we want our money back,
1428880	1432120	it would make Madoff's Ponzi scheme look like a joke.
1432120	1440600	So, you can take that for what you will.
1440600	1445320	So in wrapping up, what are the signs to watch out for to avoid Ponzi schemes?
1445320	1450080	To avoid falling victim, people should always watch out for returns that seem too good to
1450080	1451080	be true.
1451080	1455120	A promise of high returns with minimal risk is a sure red flag.
1455120	1457760	Such investments just don't exist.
1457760	1462480	Usually, with high returns, you should see high risk.
1462480	1466120	Another red flag could be the consistency of returns.
1466120	1469360	Investments are linked to market conditions, and that should affect the returns that they
1469360	1470360	bring.
1470720	1475520	If a scheme promises consistent high returns without being affected by market conditions,
1475520	1478920	there's a good chance that it could be a Ponzi scheme.
1478920	1483360	As technology evolves, there's going to be new forms of the same old trick.
1483360	1487160	Fake cryptocurrencies are the new flavour of the decade so far, and the reason being
1487160	1490320	is that they're poorly understood by many.
1490320	1495720	Very recently, some large YouTubers had taken part in a scam called Save the Children Coin,
1495720	1500760	a coin which promised to help kids in need, but also was promised to go up in value.
1500760	1505080	The scheme promised to go to the moon, but in reality, it just crashed.
1505080	1508640	Those who had the knowledge that the whole thing was a scam got out immediately with
1508640	1513480	a bunch of money, and everyone else lost everything, so be careful out there.
1513480	1516880	If you're curious and want to see more on the Save the Children Coin, the YouTube channel
1516880	1520400	CoffeeZilla did a great series on it.
1520400	1523960	Before we continue, I just want to give a quick shout out to today's sponsor, Raycon
1523960	1526120	Wireless Earbuds.
1526120	1530080	Raycon reached out to me to try their wireless earbuds, so I decided to give them a go.
1530080	1533440	I've been using their everyday earbuds for a few weeks now.
1533440	1536760	They fit really well in my ears, and there's a bunch of different tips to suit whatever
1536760	1538080	ear shape you have.
1538080	1542720	I use them when I go on my morning run, and also for calls with their built-in microphone.
1542720	1546280	I didn't have any issues with them coming loose or falling out of my ears at all.
1546280	1550480	These earbuds have 8 hours of playback time, and 32 hour battery life.
1550480	1554840	Raycon started half the price of other premium audio earbuds, but you're getting the same
1554840	1555840	sound.
