0	4000	This video is brought to you by Ground News.
4000	7000	Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.
7000	13000	We know for a fact that what all of these systems do, every single one,
13000	19000	is it exploits our own natural tendencies in human beings to get and want feedback.
19000	24000	And that feedback, chemically speaking, is the release of dopamine in your brain.
24000	27000	And so what these feedback loops do, and they exist everywhere,
27000	31000	in Call of Duty, in other video games, in social networking sites,
31000	33000	they get you to react.
33000	40000	And I think that if you get too desensitized and you need it over and over and over again,
40000	44000	then you become actually detached from the world in which you live.
44000	45000	Become callous, you become crude.
45000	47000	And live in front of your screen.
47000	50000	So we all know the benefits and usefulness of smartphones.
50000	51000	They're amazing.
51000	54000	A little rectangle in your pocket that does everything.
54000	56000	But that comes with the price.
56000	61000	There's a growing body of research that indicates that smartphones can actually change the way our brains work.
61000	66000	Did you know that just the mere presence of your phone in a room can destroy your cognitive functioning,
66000	68000	even if it's switched off?
68000	69000	Crazy, I know.
69000	71000	But literal experiments have proved this.
71000	77000	In this episode, we'll take a look at how phones affect our memory, stress levels, and cognitive function.
77000	79000	And also, here's a question.
79000	84000	If the collective brains of billions of people on Earth have been unknowingly altered worldwide,
84000	86000	what does this mean for society?
86000	88000	It's not all bad news, though.
88000	90000	We'll also take a look at how we can help ourselves.
104000	109000	In 2007, amidst the chaos of the financial crisis, the first iPhone was launched.
109000	113000	And we are calling it iPhone.
115000	123000	Computer giant Apple says it's reinvented the phone, marrying a mobile with an iPod, giving birth to the iPhone.
123000	128000	An iPod, a cell phone, and a portable internet, all in a little lightweight package.
128000	135000	The big attraction here right now is encased in a plastic tube back there, surrounded by an admiring crowd.
135000	138000	It's a sleek aluminum and stainless steel creation.
138000	142000	A cell phone doesn't have any buttons, just a touchscreen.
142000	145000	It only had 16 apps, and that was it.
145000	147000	No app store, nothing else.
147000	150000	It was relatively simple by today's standards.
150000	154000	Suddenly, buttons were replaced with a large responsive touchscreen interface.
154000	162000	People could now swipe, tap, scroll, zoom, and browse the web more efficiently than they could on a desktop.
162000	165000	At the time, such features were unheard of.
165000	171000	Although it looked interesting, very few predicted just how quickly such a small device could envelop our lives.
171000	178000	With each passing year, the phones got faster, the features grew, and the software exponentially improved.
178000	182000	Apps became useful, but then came the algorithms and feeds.
182000	186000	And before we knew it, most of us had entered a 2D virtual reality.
186000	190000	A completely separate reality and view of the world, but through a screen.
190000	197000	This was powered by algorithms designed to keep your attention, and apps designed to trigger the dopamine responses in your brain.
197000	201000	It sounds like a sci-fi film when put that way, but we all know this story by now.
201000	205000	It was one of the main themes of the Netflix show, The Social Dilemma,
205000	211000	a hallmark look into how algorithms rule our lives, and the people that made those algorithms knew what they were doing.
217000	221000	In 2008, when the true impact of smartphones was still a mystery,
221000	225000	UCLA psychiatrist Gary Small began sounding the caution alarm.
225000	233000	He was saying that heavy smartphone use could alter brain function by weakening the circuits needed for in-person interaction and reading non-verbal cues.
233000	236000	Remember, the iPhone was only one year old at this time.
236000	244000	At the time, his claims were called, quote, interesting and, quote, provocative by the science community, but it still couldn't be proved.
244000	250000	Fast forward a decade and a half later, and smartphones and their cognitive effects are being reexamined.
251000	256000	But what about the less known stuff? What other effects do smartphones have on the mind?
256000	262000	Although there's still much to learn about the long-term cognitive impact, there is some scientific evidence that should make us pause.
262000	267000	If you've ever felt that phantom buzz, or feel anxious when you haven't checked your phone in a while,
267000	271000	you don't need an expert to tell you that there's something strange at play.
273000	277000	What exactly are smartphones doing to our minds and personalities?
277000	285000	Let's take a look at the research. We're going to cover memory, addiction, cognitive function, and stress. Let's break them down.
288000	296000	Back in the day, you had to memorize all your friends' numbers, or actually listen in maths class because your teachers said that you couldn't carry a calculator 24-7.
296000	302000	Cab drivers also back in the day had no GPS. They had to know where they were going without stopping to check.
302000	310000	They had to know all the streets. It turns out that exercising that mental muscle of memory has given cab drivers physically larger hippocampi.
310000	315000	It's the memory centre of the brain, but also aids in learning and emotional processing.
315000	323000	But now, today, we heavily rely on our devices as memory aids, but new research suggests that maybe this isn't a great sign.
323000	330000	A 2021 study found that excessive smartphone use can reduce the size of the hippocampus, especially in young developing brains.
330000	335000	There's been other studies with similar findings, but unfortunately, there's even more.
335000	342000	A meta-study of MRI scans of chronic smartphone users found that they have lower grey matter volumes in specific regions of the brain.
342000	350000	This includes the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal regions.
350000	358000	While the research is still in its early stages, less grey matter usually means a higher risk of depression, schizophrenia, and dementia.
358000	361000	But remember, these are chronic smartphone users.
361000	366000	But on that note, the cost of this might be an enormous increase in dementia.
366000	367000	Quote,
367000	377000	The less you use that mind of yours, the less you use the systems that are responsible for complicated things like episodic memories or cognitive flexibility, the more likely it is to develop dementia.
377000	382000	Once you stop using your memory, it will get worse, which will make you use your devices more.
382000	389000	According to Professor Oliver Hardett, even an over-reliance on GPSs could reduce the density of grey matter in the brain.
389000	396000	To combat the effects of hippocampus shrinkage, regular exercise has shown to increase grey matter and increase memory.
396000	403000	It's also good to try and remember directions where possible, and generally try to use your memory instead of your phone where practical.
403000	408000	And if you still really just can't put your phone down, apps like Hippo Camera can help.
408000	415000	Hippo Camera is a really easy to use smartphone application that mimics how the brain supports memory.
415000	421000	Specific behaviors also don't do our brains any favours. One of these is attempting to multitask.
421000	426000	Interestingly, humans multitasking is a myth. Only 2.5% of us can do it effectively.
426000	430000	Catherine Price writes about this in her book, How to Break Up with Your Phone.
430000	434000	In particular, she wants about the dangers of continual partial attention.
434000	440000	It's checking your phone while mid-conversation, or scrolling on social media while watching TV. Sound familiar?
440000	444000	While we do this to attempt to be more productive, it harms our cognitive health.
444000	451000	In fact, trying to consistently multitask can actually hinder your ability to think deep and complex thoughts.
451000	458000	It also can create a false sense of urgency, which prevents our brain's ability to transfer information into long-term storage.
458000	462000	And from here, it becomes harder to accumulate memories.
462000	467000	In summary, every minute distracted by your phone is a lost minute in the here and now.
467000	476000	This can leave behind a trail of forgotten experiences and damage the ability to formulate deep and complex thoughts and long-term memories.
476000	479000	Moving on to number 2, addiction.
479000	486000	Now this detrimental effect is more commonly known, but did you know that nomophobia is the real fear of being away from one's phone?
486000	494000	For heavy users, a study by Dr. Larry Rossin, the author of The Distracted Mind, revealed what a lack of smartphone access can do.
494000	499000	Participants in the experiment were strapped to sweat and heat monitors as they read a passage.
499000	503000	Their phones were out of reach, but they could hear text notifications flooding in.
503000	507000	The result was a spike in anxiety and a drop in reading comprehension.
507000	511000	And this will affect more people as we're all using our smartphones more.
511000	521000	Between 2019 and 2023, average mobile screen time shot up by 23% from 2 hours and 56 minutes to 3 hours and 46 minutes.
521000	526000	The average user now checks their phones 96 times per day.
526000	535000	Research from a peer-reviewed medical journal Psychiatry Research, Neuroimaging, confirms that excessive smartphone use presents itself a lot like addiction,
535000	540000	weakening vital brain networks that control things like paying attention and stopping impulses.
540000	545000	This leads to withdrawal symptoms and continued use despite negative consequences.
545000	547000	There's a silent epidemic that we're neglecting.
547000	554000	One can imagine the impact, albeit to varying degrees, on the 6.84 billion smartphone users worldwide.
554000	560000	When you factor in the amount of developing brains that are using the devices, what will be the end result?
560000	567000	As smartphone use increases each year, even the smartphone's creators are questioning the monster that they've unleashed.
568000	571000	Tony Fidel, who worked on the original iPhone team, says,
585000	590000	As a side, I've done a full episode on the story of the people who created the iPhone if you're interested.
590000	593000	But zooming out, we can't blame the phone manufacturers.
593000	600000	If you've watched the social dilemma, you would have seen former tech employees expressing a sense of regret regarding the designs of social media apps.
600000	603000	We are increasingly glued to our phones.
603000	607000	Just look at this 30 seconds we filmed outside Oxford Circus earlier today.
607000	610000	All the white flashes are the phones people are on.
610000	612000	So we've left them in that room.
612000	616000	We've said we've left a camera on record to film them getting on.
616000	621000	And now we're just going to leave them there and see how many times they look at their phone.
621000	625000	Harry, you got your phone out after three minutes. Is that a surprise to you?
625000	630000	It is a surprise to me actually because I didn't think I used technology that often.
630000	632000	I didn't think I was that dependent on it.
632000	634000	I'm surprised I lost in four minutes.
634000	638000	The role of addictive design in social media has been well documented.
638000	645000	Casino-like features like pull-to-refresh mimic slot machines and exploit the pleasure of anticipating rewards.
645000	650000	And interestingly, this can trigger larger dopamine spikes than the rewards themselves.
650000	654000	Also infinite scrolling and autoplay to lull a user into mindless behavior.
654000	662000	But a silver lining is that since 2018, Apple and Google have built digital well-being features into their phones to prevent overuse.
662000	665000	So the tools are there. People just have to use them.
665000	668000	Number three, cognitive function.
668000	673000	A 2022 study found that our reading comprehension declines when we read from a screen,
673000	676000	even if the text is exactly the same as it is on paper.
676000	679000	The chart you see now shows reading comprehension scores.
679000	683000	The red is reading from paper, while the blue is reading from a phone.
683000	686000	In addition, as mentioned at the top of this episode,
686000	693000	the mere presence of your smartphone in the same room lowers your ability to focus, remember, and solve problems.
693000	696000	The phone doesn't even have to be switched on.
696000	700000	Researchers at the University of Chicago call this brain drain.
700000	704000	It happens because the human brain has a limited capacity to process information,
704000	707000	meaning we have to prioritize what we want to focus on.
707000	711000	When your phone is nearby, it competes for cognitive resources,
711000	714000	and your brain must work extra hard to resist its temptation.
714000	717000	This sabotages your concentration on other tasks.
717000	720000	So let's look at the experiment. It's remarkable.
720000	726000	Quote, the researchers asked participants to either put their phones next to them so they were visible, like on a desk,
726000	731000	nearby and out of sight, like in a bag or pocket, or in another room.
731000	736000	Participants then completed a series of tasks to test their abilities to process and remember information.
736000	739000	Their problem solving, and their focus.
739000	743000	They were found to perform far better when their phones were in another room instead of nearby,
743000	746000	whether visible, powered on, or not.
746000	752000	That held true, even though most of the participants claimed not to be consciously thinking about their devices.
752000	755000	So it's an effect that happens even though we don't notice it.
755000	757000	Quite fascinating.
757000	761000	And finally, number four, stress.
761000	763000	Smartphones aren't just changing our behavior.
763000	767000	They're affecting human biology, and the health risks can get pretty serious.
767000	773000	Endocrinologist Robert Lustig warns that smartphone notifications have turned us all into Pavlov's dogs,
773000	777000	training our brains to be in a constant state of fear and stress.
777000	779000	Here's how it happened.
779000	785000	1. Neurons in the prefrontal cortex are altered after exposure to a flood of neurotransmitters.
785000	792000	One common trigger of neurotransmitters to flood the brain is the anticipation of rewards, like the UIA on Instagram.
792000	796000	2. This can cause our prefrontal cortex, the brain's decision-making hub,
796000	800000	and emotional control center to go completely haywire and even shut down.
800000	806000	And 3. When the prefrontal cortex shuts down, the amygdala, responsible for emotional regulation,
806000	809000	takes over, inducing stress and panic.
809000	814000	When our prefrontal cortex is overworked in this state, one's self-control can take a hit.
814000	819000	Then to add to the pile, there's the information that we receive from social media.
819000	823000	From doom-scrolling to the creation of young hypochondriacs on TikTok,
823000	825000	self-diagnosing themselves into oblivion.
825000	827000	The answer is yes, you have trauma.
827000	832000	Procrastination is actually a short-term coping tool to avoid feeling anxiety or dread.
832000	838000	A popular type of video on TikTok is five things you might not realize were a mental disorder,
838000	843000	and it's really generic things like biting your nails or fidgeting or being a people pleaser.
843000	847000	I just need to take an anxiety nap. Can you wake me up in like 30 minutes? I'm like not well.
847000	852000	In a lot of this discussion, the problem isn't with the smartphones themselves, but social media use.
852000	858000	And this was solidified by a 2023 global study of over 50,000 participants.
858000	860000	But we have to stay level-headed.
860000	865000	There's research to suggest that about 30 minutes of daily social media is actually beneficial,
865000	868000	but going past about an hour can be detrimental.
868000	873000	One of the most impactful outcomes of smartphones has been the way we consume daily news.
873000	880000	For example, when OpenAI released GPT-40 last week, it might surprise you how different media covered the story in different ways.
880000	884000	Take, for example, this story on the recent OpenAI Reddit content deal.
884000	887000	The story was reported on by 55 news outlets.
887000	893000	This left-leaning headline from Business Insider frames the story as one regarding big data concerns.
893000	899000	A right-leaning outlet focuses on the political orientation of Reddit users, as well as the monetary size of the deal.
899000	904000	So when someone's scrolling through a news feed that's tailor-made for them with news articles that confirm their bias,
904000	907000	they're unlikely to see the other side of the story outside of their bubble.
907000	910000	And this is what the algorithms of today have created.
910000	915000	So it's important to get the whole picture, and that's where today's sponsor, GroundNews, comes in.
915000	919000	GroundNews is a website and app developed by a former NASA engineer
919000	924000	who was on a mission to give readers an easy, data-driven, objective way to read the news.
924000	928000	Every story comes with a quick visual breakdown of political bias.
928000	935000	Factuality and the ownership of the source's reporting all backed by ratings from three independent news monitoring organizations.
935000	939000	For example, let's go back to that story on the OpenAI Reddit deal.
939000	943000	On GroundNews, everything is organized to make it easy for you to see all the details.
943000	947000	Their bias distribution shows you the political bias of the reporting outlets.
947000	952000	Below, you can see the factuality information, as well as the ownership information.
952000	957000	For this story, 31% of reporting outlets are owned by media conglomerates.
957000	963000	I especially like the bling feed, which highlights stories that are heavily covered by one side of the political spectrum.
963000	967000	It's important to utilize critical thinking and breakout of online echo chambers.
967000	974000	If we know where these views are coming from, we're probably going to be better equipped to engage in constructive dialogue to those who hold different views.
974000	979000	GroundNews is a fantastic tool for sifting through the daily misinformation and bias.
979000	982000	They provide all the tools you need to be a critical thinker.

996000	997000	Thank you.
997000	998000	Now back to the video.
998000	1001000	So what happens when people break away from smartphones completely?
1001000	1008000	Well, fortunately, we have a slew of examples from those who are heavy smartphone users and decided to ditch them for a dumb phone.
1008000	1011000	The way they describe their experiences is pretty interesting.
1011000	1013000	Let's take a quick look at some testimonials.
1013000	1019000	I was not ready for how much I truly enjoyed this phone.
1019000	1025000	I was present with my kids, with my wife, I was able to be reached by friends and family.
1025000	1026000	A bit about my experience.
1026000	1028000	Just what is it like living without a smartphone?
1028000	1033000	For those of us who grew up in the 90s, I think there's a lot of nostalgia around that time.
1033000	1038000	And for me, a lot of that is about the fact that nobody had a smartphone or even a cell phone.
1038000	1045000	But I was surprised and excited to find that I could kind of reconnect with some of the benefits of that time through this experiment.
1045000	1050000	I've been much more focused at work because all of my work now takes place in front of the computer.
1050000	1054000	So I'm much more intentional and focused when it is actually time to work.
1054000	1060000	I have time for creative hobbies because I'm not scrolling through social media or news or anything on my phone.
1060000	1064000	My phone doesn't do anything fun and that means I have time to get bored.
1064000	1066000	Have you ever been bored as an adult?
1066000	1071000	I don't think I had until this experiment, but boredom equals creativity.
1071000	1078000	But then there were others and this group wasn't quite as sold on the dumb phone idea and quickly found themselves reverting back to a smartphone.
1078000	1086000	Alright, so I'm nearly finished with this 30-day experiment and if I'm being completely honest, I cannot wait to get back to a smartphone.
1086000	1089000	I entered this experiment really wanting it to work.
1089000	1095000	Really wanting to find a phone that would give me all the tools I needed while removing the headaches my smartphone causes.
1095000	1098000	But unfortunately, I don't know if I'm ready to make the switch full-time.
1098000	1103000	Not having a camera, the spotty directions, and the clunky typing are the biggest deal-breakers for me.
1103000	1109000	This is the phone that you could literally only call with, which is great if that's all I needed,
1109000	1120000	but I'd have to be damn confident with my job security and friendships because I could see how easily I could lose connections and friendships due to my inability to respond.
1120000	1126000	There are more people giving dumb phones a try, so much so that some call it the anti-smartphone revolution.
1126000	1133000	You can check out my podcast episode with Kai-Wai Tang, the co-founder of Lightphone, and I discussed this topic in depth with him.
1133000	1137000	So if you've gotten to this part of the episode, you're probably in one of three camps.
1137000	1144000	One, all of this information is new to you, or the second camp, you've heard some of this before and learned some new things.
1144000	1149000	Or, even if you're one of those who have heard all of this before, I think it's important to remind ourselves.
1149000	1152000	But what about the bigger picture? What does all of this mean?
1152000	1160000	It's insane to think that there's the possibility that hundreds of millions or even billions of people out there could have worse memory, worse concentration,
1160000	1164000	smaller grey matter, and increased anxiety due to chronic smartphone overuse.
1164000	1168000	I'm going to ask you, do you think this explains part of the world we live in today?
1168000	1174000	Although it all sounds terrible, fortunately there are very practical things that can be done, as we've talked about.
1174000	1178000	Number one, exercise. Two, avoid the overuse of social media.
1178000	1185000	Three, stop multitasking. Four, if you want to increase comprehension, choose to read physical media instead of your phone.
1185000	1190000	And five, if you want to improve memory, limit phone use for memory tasks where possible.
1190000	1194000	At the end of the day, the power is still in our hands.
1194000	1200000	So what's your opinion on all of this? Did this speak to you? Do you think you use your smartphone too much?
1200000	1204000	Or do you think you've got everything under control? I'd love to hear from you in the comments.
1204000	1208000	So anyway, that is how your smartphone is rewiring your brain.

1230000	1235000	I feel I'm getting older all the time in the bay
