00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

00:06.240 --> 00:12.040
Over 230 years, through world wars, the rise and fall of nations and industries, revolutions

00:12.040 --> 00:16.200
and uprisings, Bering's Bank persevered.

00:16.200 --> 00:22.400
Founded in 1762, Bering's Bank was an English institution associated with class, longevity

00:22.400 --> 00:27.560
and strength, so much so that even the Queen of England had an account with them.

00:27.560 --> 00:33.960
Then, in 1995, this grand banking legacy was destroyed, brought down by a single rogue

00:33.960 --> 00:36.560
trader by the name of Nick Leeson.

00:36.560 --> 00:44.360
So, let's explore how a 28-year-old from Hertfordshire was able to single-handedly destroy an institution.

00:44.360 --> 00:55.360
You are watching Cold Fusion TV.

00:55.360 --> 00:59.160
Nick Leeson was born in Wardford, Hertfordshire, to a middle-class home.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.960
He was a confident but unimpressive student.

01:01.960 --> 01:06.480
Despite his average educational performance, he was eventually able to secure a job with

01:06.480 --> 01:08.200
Morgan Stanley.

01:08.200 --> 01:13.680
He worked in their futures and options department, giving support to the traders on the frontline.

01:13.680 --> 01:19.080
In 1989, two years after starting with Morgan Stanley, Nick Leeson approached his supervisor

01:19.080 --> 01:20.720
and asked to be promoted.

01:20.720 --> 01:24.760
Leeson wanted to be a trader and he felt that he deserved the promotion.

01:24.760 --> 01:29.720
Unfortunately, his manager didn't agree and the request was turned down.

01:29.720 --> 01:34.920
But Leeson knew what he wanted and, subsequently, he quit Morgan Stanley.

01:34.920 --> 01:39.040
On his quest to become a stock trader, he would come across Bering's Bank and send in his

01:39.040 --> 01:40.040
application.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.480
Apparently, he'd never heard of the bank before submitting the application.

01:43.480 --> 01:47.960
At that stage, I probably would be happy to say that I'd never heard of Bering's.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.520
But it was a famous old bank.

01:51.520 --> 01:55.720
So, there's no Bering's in Watford.

01:55.720 --> 01:57.680
Bering's was no ordinary bank.

01:57.680 --> 02:00.800
It catered to the most affluent class of people.

02:00.800 --> 02:03.920
In the banking industry, the Bering's name was respected.

02:03.920 --> 02:07.760
It was the safest of all banks and they could raise capital very easily.

02:08.120 --> 02:12.000
Though, behind the scenes, its operations were struggling to keep up with the modern

02:12.000 --> 02:13.840
banking world.

02:13.840 --> 02:18.120
Leeson described the securities trading department of Bering's as being in stark contrast to

02:18.120 --> 02:20.880
modern banks like Morgan Stanley.

02:20.880 --> 02:22.320
Just a totally different environment.

02:22.320 --> 02:27.160
There was, you know, Morgan Stanley, everything was new.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.680
You know, all of the equipment was new.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.360
The furniture was new.

02:31.360 --> 02:36.120
At Bering's, everything is, you know, just tacky, I suppose.

02:36.120 --> 02:40.200
I can't describe it any other way.

02:40.200 --> 02:44.520
From his position as one of the bank's bookkeepers, it didn't take him very long to find flaws

02:44.520 --> 02:47.240
in how the bank operated.

02:47.240 --> 02:51.320
Bering's bank was crumbling during a time when most other financial institutions were

02:51.320 --> 02:52.840
thriving.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.560
Feeding on the good standing that comes with two centuries of global trading, it would

02:56.560 --> 02:59.600
survive though, much like it always had.

02:59.600 --> 03:06.600
But what Bering's wouldn't survive would be hiring Nick Leeson.

03:06.600 --> 03:11.400
While many in the industry, including Leeson, possessed the intelligence to succeed, Leeson

03:11.400 --> 03:16.680
also had a confidence and a way with people that he would wield like a secret weapon.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.640
He was charming, friendly, and personable to his colleagues.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.880
But not just for the sake of being polite.

03:22.880 --> 03:28.320
He saw his co-workers, not as potential companions, but rather a means to an end.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.920
Despite working at banks for multiple years, he never considered his co-workers his friends.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.720
He did not like them, he did not respect them, but he knew that sometimes he needed them

03:37.720 --> 03:40.560
to get what he wanted.

03:40.560 --> 03:46.320
It's very easy for me to get on with people, but I don't necessarily have to like you

03:46.320 --> 03:49.240
or any of the people that I work with to get on with them.

03:49.240 --> 03:54.200
So I come in, I do my job, I do it to the best of my ability, and then at the end of

03:54.200 --> 03:57.200
the day, if you're going to ask me out for a drink, I'm not going to go out for a drink

03:57.200 --> 04:00.600
with you because I don't like you.

04:00.600 --> 04:05.280
Nick Leeson impressed his superiors at bearings with his keen eye for identifying and solving

04:05.280 --> 04:07.400
issues within the bank.

04:07.400 --> 04:12.680
Not long into his employment, he was sent overseas to chase down massive sums of money.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.960
These were debts that were long overdue, but never followed up on.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.680
Bearing's bank had a habit of making deals that would fall between the cracks, and it

04:20.680 --> 04:25.400
was Nick Leeson's fresh eyes that would hunt down these deals and claim back what the bank

04:25.400 --> 04:26.800
was owed.

04:26.800 --> 04:31.880
Leeson managed to find close to Â£100 million, the equivalent of twice of that today when

04:31.880 --> 04:33.680
factoring inflation.

04:33.680 --> 04:38.840
He describes this kind of mismanagement as being fairly typical for bearings.

04:38.840 --> 04:40.560
Things were looking good for Leeson.

04:40.560 --> 04:45.360
He was impressing his employees, and while in Jakarta, he met a fellow bearing staff

04:45.360 --> 04:48.480
member by the name of Lisa Sims.

04:48.480 --> 04:52.280
For the first time in his career, he found a colleague that he genuinely liked, and

04:52.280 --> 04:56.520
in 1992, the two of them married.

04:56.520 --> 05:01.360
But same month, his years of hard work finally paid off when bearings offered him the position

05:01.360 --> 05:02.360
of a trader.

05:02.360 --> 05:07.160
He would be in charge of a newly founded futures division in Singapore.

05:07.160 --> 05:11.600
This was the opportunity that Leeson had been waiting for, and quite possibly, the worst

05:11.600 --> 05:16.480
decision that bearings had ever made.

05:16.480 --> 05:22.280
Approved to trade in Singapore, and having convinced his wife Lisa to move, it was go-time.

05:22.280 --> 05:27.960
Being primarily on the Nikkei, Japan's top 225 company stock index, Nik thoroughly enjoyed

05:27.960 --> 05:32.360
the stress and pressure of futures trading, essentially betting on if the price will rise

05:32.360 --> 05:33.860
or fall.

05:33.860 --> 05:37.120
If the market went the way he predicted, he made money.

05:37.120 --> 05:40.280
If not, he rapidly lost money.

05:40.280 --> 05:45.280
He was confident in himself and beloved by his staff, but later that year, the market

05:45.280 --> 05:50.120
began fluctuating violently, and Leeson's team started making mistakes.

05:50.120 --> 05:54.560
These bad bets were adding up, and if they weren't rectified, bearings stood to lose

05:54.560 --> 05:58.280
large sums of money.

05:58.280 --> 06:02.280
Out of the fear of losing the job that he worked so hard to obtain, and fuelled by his

06:02.280 --> 06:08.860
own self-confidence, Nik decided to hide the losing bets from his employers back home.

06:08.860 --> 06:13.160
In order to do this, he altered the software of a separate hidden account so that his bosses

06:13.160 --> 06:15.680
in England couldn't keep track.

06:15.680 --> 06:19.400
He named this account the 5 eighths account.

06:19.400 --> 06:24.560
After Leeson kept his losing trades active, but hidden, he assumed that inevitably he'd

06:24.560 --> 06:27.880
be able to cancel out the losses with future wins.

06:27.880 --> 06:32.040
But there was only one problem with this, margin payments.

06:32.040 --> 06:36.360
While the losing trades remained open, payments still had to be made in order to keep the

06:36.360 --> 06:37.640
trades going.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.760
He was going to need external funding.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.600
He just needed enough money to keep the failed trades going, and when the market turned around,

06:44.600 --> 06:47.520
he'd be home free.

06:47.520 --> 06:51.480
Leeson would hide his mistakes, and then when the market went his way, he would fix his

06:51.480 --> 06:53.680
mistakes in private.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.880
Nik had to keep digging into a deeper pit of lies.

06:56.880 --> 07:02.320
His bosses over in England could never find out what happened.

07:02.320 --> 07:06.440
He asked his superiors for funds to cover stock futures that he'd bought for clients.

07:06.440 --> 07:09.880
Only this time, the clients didn't exist.

07:09.880 --> 07:14.040
Trusting that Leeson had the bank's best interests in mind, the branch over in England

07:14.040 --> 07:18.400
happily sent him ever-increasing amounts of money, without ever thinking to double-check

07:18.400 --> 07:21.120
where the money was actually going.

07:21.120 --> 07:24.880
Surprisingly, for a time, the system worked.

07:24.880 --> 07:28.600
Leeson described living with the lies as easy after the first two days.

07:28.600 --> 07:33.840
From the first time I do anything, I'm not expecting to survive anything more than two

07:33.840 --> 07:34.840
days.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.320
To me, it's obvious.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.560
If they can't see it after two days, then who says they're going to see it after two

07:39.560 --> 07:40.560
hundred days?

07:40.560 --> 07:41.560
Five hundred days?

07:41.560 --> 07:42.560
A thousand days?

07:42.560 --> 07:46.440
I don't get confident, but you're getting away with it.

07:46.440 --> 07:51.480
As Nik Leeson continued to cover up his trading mistakes, Bering's itself was making massive

07:51.480 --> 07:55.600
losses, and that was just the amount they knew about.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.840
Something had to be done, so they recruited Peter Norris.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.000
He was to oversee operations.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.320
From the moment he began looking at the bank's records, Norris was shocked at what he found.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.080
The books were a mess.

08:08.080 --> 08:12.040
How shocked were you by the lack of control in that when you got in there and began to

08:12.040 --> 08:14.240
work there?

08:14.240 --> 08:24.720
I was shocked because I didn't feel that it should have been allowed to reach that point.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.960
He saw a bank on the brink of collapse with ever-increasing debt and a loose grip on its

08:28.960 --> 08:32.360
standing as a powerful player in the financial world.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.400
He brought in a team to clean up the mess.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.720
But the dire situation that shocked Norris was merely a fraction of the problem.

08:39.720 --> 08:46.240
He was yet to find the hidden account in Singapore that would eventually collapse the entire bank.

08:46.240 --> 08:52.720
Meanwhile, Leeson's plan to gradually cover his losses and emerge victorious had not gone

08:52.720 --> 08:53.920
to plan.

08:53.920 --> 08:59.920
By the end of 1992, his losses had only grown, now amounting to Â£4 million.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.840
Seeing no way out, there was only one thing to do.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.400
Gamble even harder.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.320
Going against the bank's rules, he bought hundreds of additional futures in hopes of

09:09.320 --> 09:10.920
covering his losses.

09:10.920 --> 09:14.920
He bought so many orders that if the market was to move in his favour, it would completely

09:14.920 --> 09:16.640
wipe out his debt.

09:16.640 --> 09:22.360
He believed he could make his money back without anyone ever finding out what he had done.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.400
At this point, he was struggling to sleep at night.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.840
But surprisingly, it worked.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.920
By July of 1993, he had covered his losses.

09:32.920 --> 09:38.260
Leeson described the past nine months as a living nightmare, but he had done it and come

09:38.260 --> 09:41.060
out relatively unscathed.

09:41.060 --> 09:45.260
Unfortunately for all involved, Leeson had not learned his lesson.

09:45.260 --> 09:49.620
In fact, what he had learned was how to commit fraud and get away with it.

09:49.620 --> 09:53.900
Rather than take away a valuable lesson in risk management, Leeson saw an opportunity

09:53.900 --> 09:55.620
to get filthy rich.

09:55.620 --> 09:59.580
Nick was convinced by his past successes that he would eventually be able to trade out of

09:59.580 --> 10:04.860
any amount of losses and maintain his reputation as an industry legend.

10:04.860 --> 10:07.980
In his mind, he was a genius that had beaten the system.

10:07.980 --> 10:11.380
But in reality, what had happened was just dumb luck.

10:11.380 --> 10:15.820
Meanwhile, back in England, Bering's was recouping losses and the work of Peter Norris

10:15.820 --> 10:17.500
was paying off.

10:17.500 --> 10:19.660
Things were going well and the bank was recovering.

10:19.660 --> 10:26.300
But the work wasn't over, so Bering's brought in a new head of in-house trading, Rob Baker.

10:26.300 --> 10:31.220
Baker was a smart man and he valued tight oversight unlike his predecessors.

10:31.220 --> 10:35.220
He was cynical of profits that couldn't be easily accounted for.

10:35.220 --> 10:39.260
Because of this, Nick Leeson's department quickly caught his eye.

10:39.260 --> 10:43.980
You see, Bering's bank was paying Nick Leeson to fund requests for new clients and they

10:43.980 --> 10:48.340
noticed that some of these clients, who actually in reality didn't exist, were not keeping

10:48.340 --> 10:50.780
up with their fees.

10:50.780 --> 11:00.820
An internal audit was ordered and in July of 1993, the auditors flew to Singapore.

11:00.820 --> 11:06.220
By the end of 1993, Leeson had found himself in the same trouble as last time, only this

11:06.220 --> 11:10.300
time doubling up his strategy didn't work.

11:10.300 --> 11:14.900
By the time Baker came face to face with Leeson, his secret account was now hiding losses

11:14.900 --> 11:17.220
of 94 million pounds.

11:17.220 --> 11:21.540
Nick would sometimes lose a million pounds in a single day.

11:21.540 --> 11:25.940
Rob Baker saw through Leeson's confidence, recognizing a struggling and immature man

11:25.940 --> 11:28.740
who didn't take too kindly to being overseen.

11:28.740 --> 11:34.460
But what he could not have predicted was what was truly going on behind the scenes.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.380
Leeson was now extremely worried.

11:36.380 --> 11:41.020
He understood that if the auditors found just one document referring to the secret 5 eighths

11:41.020 --> 11:45.540
account where his losses were hidden, his entire scheme would unravel.

11:45.540 --> 11:49.860
But luck would be in his favor again, as the auditors surprisingly found nothing.

11:49.860 --> 12:06.780
Leeson would later state that it was general incompetence from the bearing staff that allowed

12:06.780 --> 12:08.860
him to go on undiscovered.

12:08.860 --> 12:11.540
But Rob Baker has a different theory.

12:11.540 --> 12:15.220
Nick was supposedly making the bank a bunch of money, so they didn't bother to question

12:15.220 --> 12:19.780
the fact that Nick was both the head of Singapore Trading Operations and in charge of the Singapore

12:19.780 --> 12:20.980
accounting.

12:20.980 --> 12:26.180
And despite the strange accounts not paying any fees, bearings thought, hey, if it's

12:26.180 --> 12:31.540
making us money, don't fix it.

12:31.540 --> 12:39.340
By September of 1994, the secret 5 eighths account was hiding losses of 160 million pounds.

12:39.340 --> 12:42.260
Leeson's fraud entered new levels of complexity.

12:42.260 --> 12:46.860
He decided to use the secret account to buy futures from himself at extremely discounted

12:46.940 --> 12:50.740
prices, allowing him to fake massive profits.

12:50.740 --> 12:55.540
Nick was now in a deep, vicious, unsustainable cycle.

12:55.540 --> 13:00.100
It could only continue so long as he had access to the fund that bearings would send him for

13:00.100 --> 13:01.900
fake clients.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.340
His life became a runaway train.

13:04.340 --> 13:09.540
In secret, he was losing millions daily, but in public, he was becoming the star trader

13:09.540 --> 13:11.260
that he always wanted to be.

13:11.260 --> 13:13.940
Neither could exist without the other.

13:13.940 --> 13:18.380
At this time, Leeson became known as the king of the exchange.

13:18.380 --> 13:24.380
He was making a name for himself and had convinced the world that he was a success.

13:24.380 --> 13:28.220
In December of 1994, Leeson was flown to New York.

13:28.220 --> 13:32.980
Here, bearings held a traders conference and Nick was the star.

13:32.980 --> 13:37.820
After all, according to the records, he had made the bank 28 million pounds that year

13:37.820 --> 13:38.820
alone.

13:38.820 --> 13:42.820
He was the poster boy of bearings bank and celebrated for a success.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.540
But some of the other traders weren't as excited.

13:45.540 --> 13:49.460
They had done their own maths and something didn't add up.

13:49.460 --> 13:53.020
But the bearings bank executives paid no attention to these doubts.

13:53.020 --> 13:55.220
The bank was on the way up.

13:55.220 --> 13:59.220
It even got to the stage when Nick was asking for hundreds of thousands of pounds per day

13:59.220 --> 14:04.860
for margin payments and without question, it was given to him.

14:04.860 --> 14:10.860
By the end of 1994, based solely on lies, confidently told and expertly hidden, bearings

14:10.900 --> 14:19.900
bank had transferred 75% of their entire capital into the hands of one man, Nick Leeson, 330

14:19.900 --> 14:21.740
million pounds.

14:21.740 --> 14:25.940
The pressure had become too much for Leeson and he had finally reached breaking point.

14:25.940 --> 14:28.740
How could he live a lie so massive?

14:28.740 --> 14:32.780
On a Christmas trip to Ireland, he told his wife that he did not want to return back to

14:32.780 --> 14:33.780
Singapore.

14:33.780 --> 14:37.740
But Leeson didn't understand why he would turn down such a great opportunity for their

14:37.740 --> 14:38.740
family.

14:38.820 --> 14:41.940
Nick couldn't bring himself to tell her the truth.

14:41.940 --> 14:44.980
So he returned to Singapore in the new year.

14:44.980 --> 14:45.980
Why lie?

14:45.980 --> 14:46.980
I'm his wife.

14:46.980 --> 14:47.980
Why should he lie?

14:47.980 --> 14:53.860
I mean, I suppose lots of wives think that when they find out their husbands have been

14:53.860 --> 14:57.740
having an affair and they think, well, you know, they've been leading a double life.

14:57.740 --> 14:58.740
And that's what it feels like.

14:58.740 --> 15:06.580
Not that Nick had an affair, it feels like Nick was leading a double life.

15:06.580 --> 15:10.500
There was no economic or political factors impacting the Japanese market.

15:10.500 --> 15:14.700
So Nick Leeson bet on stability and for a while it was working.

15:14.700 --> 15:18.780
For a couple of weeks he was making a profit as the market remained steady.

15:18.780 --> 15:24.100
If this kept going, his losses could be erased and he would be victorious once again.

15:24.100 --> 15:30.940
But on January 17th at 5.46am, a massive earthquake struck the Japanese city of Kobe.

15:30.940 --> 15:34.820
It killed 6,000 and displaced 45,000.

15:34.820 --> 15:40.100
The Japanese Nikkei Stock Index, in which Nick was trading, absolutely crumbled.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.260
It was bad, you know.

15:43.260 --> 15:45.580
But again, it's living to fight another day, really.

15:45.580 --> 15:53.380
I mean, you know, without the choice of running away from it, you know, I had to, bearings

15:53.380 --> 15:58.140
were still paying me money, don't forget, they were still paying me masses of money,

15:58.140 --> 15:59.140
you know.

15:59.140 --> 16:02.180
I mean, we'd ask for sometimes for $100 million, they'd pay it.

16:02.180 --> 16:05.020
With the market running away from him, he was desperate.

16:05.020 --> 16:09.780
He made one final bet, buying thousands more futures contracts in an attempt to prop up

16:09.780 --> 16:11.420
the market.

16:11.420 --> 16:16.020
He was hoping that this move would be substantial enough to fight against the crash.

16:16.020 --> 16:17.660
It was another failed gamble.

16:17.660 --> 16:23.940
In a single day he lost a further Â£50 million, but he continued down this path.

16:23.940 --> 16:28.780
He asked the bank for more money which they would provide on the basis of falsified profits,

16:28.780 --> 16:33.740
fictitious profits manufactured from the secret 5 eighths account.

16:33.740 --> 16:37.780
While bearings continued to believe Lee Sin's deception, they were happy with his falsified

16:37.780 --> 16:40.860
profits and trusted that he was doing well.

16:40.860 --> 16:44.980
They believed that he was taking advantage of the chaotic market since the earthquake

16:44.980 --> 16:48.420
and making huge sums of money for everyone involved.

16:48.420 --> 16:53.980
At one stage, auditors found a Â£50 million loss that Nick forgot to hide.

16:53.980 --> 16:59.420
Frantically, Nick forged a bank loan document with scissors and glue to cover it up.

16:59.420 --> 17:04.300
Amazingly, the auditors believed the document, even though it had, from Nick and Lisa at

17:04.300 --> 17:08.100
the top, the fax signature from their home machine.

17:08.100 --> 17:14.620
Then, finally, after all the close calls, audits, unimaginable debt, and luck, both

17:14.620 --> 17:20.100
good and bad, Lee Sin's time was up.

17:20.100 --> 17:25.060
On the 17th of February, a single clerk in Singapore noticed some discrepancies in Lee

17:25.060 --> 17:28.300
Sin's accounts and brought them to his attention.

17:28.300 --> 17:32.980
After failing to deflect the clerk's enquiries for a week, he knew that this time he couldn't

17:32.980 --> 17:35.140
make this one go away.

17:35.140 --> 17:39.340
Feeling that the walls were finally closing in, Nick told the clerk that his wife was

17:39.340 --> 17:40.340
unwell.

17:40.340 --> 17:43.700
He had to go and visit her, and he'd be back in 45 minutes.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.540
Of course, this was a lie.

17:46.540 --> 17:50.380
Nick frantically rushed home to collect his wife, packed up his belongings, and they both

17:50.380 --> 17:55.020
drove to the airport and boarded a flight to a luxury resort in Malaysia.

17:55.020 --> 17:59.500
That week, with Nick gone and not being able to provide any more distractions, the bearings

17:59.500 --> 18:03.900
officers from London were finally able to access one of Lee Sin's accounts.

18:03.900 --> 18:05.740
It was a horrific disaster.

18:05.740 --> 18:09.340
They knew straight away that bankruptcy was inevitable.

18:35.740 --> 18:47.860
Bearings appealed to England's central bank for support.

18:47.860 --> 18:51.860
They were desperate for a bailout before the markets opened again on Monday.

18:51.860 --> 18:52.860
But it was impossible.

18:52.860 --> 18:59.900
Lee Sin's losses had multiplied to 830 million pounds, the equivalent of US$2 billion today.

18:59.900 --> 19:03.220
It was clear that the bank couldn't be saved.

19:03.220 --> 19:09.380
After two long centuries of banking, bearings collapsed.

19:09.380 --> 19:15.500
On the 20th of November 1995, Lee Sin was arrested in Germany and extradited to Singapore.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.700
He was charged with two counts of deceiving the bank's auditors and of cheating the Singapore

19:19.700 --> 19:21.180
exchange.

19:21.180 --> 19:26.020
He received a six and a half year prison sentence, but he was released after four years for good

19:26.020 --> 19:30.140
behaviour.

19:30.140 --> 19:34.820
In all of this, Lee Sin maintains a dismissive and blameless attitude towards the events

19:34.820 --> 19:36.100
that caused the crash.

19:36.100 --> 19:39.820
In his mind, the fault lies with those who ran bearings and not him.

19:39.820 --> 19:44.740
Why didn't those people who ran bearings come to you and say, what are you doing?

19:44.740 --> 19:45.740
Because they're stupid.

19:45.740 --> 19:49.500
They don't understand the business and they should never have been in the position that

19:49.500 --> 19:52.780
they were in, especially people like Tony Hawes.

19:52.780 --> 19:56.580
He was supposed to be controlling the global treasury function.

19:56.580 --> 19:59.740
He was supposed to understand derivatives.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.740
He didn't.

20:00.740 --> 20:06.860
And he would pay the money every single day and would accept pretty ridiculous explanations

20:06.860 --> 20:07.860
from me.

20:07.860 --> 20:08.860
It wouldn't happen at Morgan Stanley.

20:08.860 --> 20:13.860
At bearings, they had a lot of idiots basically in every one of the controlling functions.

20:13.860 --> 20:19.260
And you were creating a large amount of profits?

20:19.260 --> 20:21.020
Fictitiously, yeah.

20:21.020 --> 20:26.660
It's a complete amazement, but as you get to know the people at bearings, you can then

20:26.660 --> 20:27.660
understand the amazement.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.940
A lot of them are just bumbling fools.

20:30.940 --> 20:35.420
Although his arrogance is distasteful, the law was inclined to agree with him.

20:35.420 --> 20:39.500
The courts found bearings to be responsible for the deficit in internal auditing and risk

20:39.500 --> 20:40.500
management.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.420
Their carelessness allowed the fraud to spiral out of control.

20:43.420 --> 20:47.420
But this shouldn't distract from the fact that hordes of people lost their jobs and

20:47.420 --> 20:50.820
their money during the bearings' failure.

20:50.820 --> 20:56.260
In the fallout from the collapse, Dutch bank ING bought bearings for a single pound.

20:56.260 --> 20:58.620
They later sold off various assets.

20:58.620 --> 21:04.340
Today, bearings exists only as a cautionary tale, a lesson to banks across the globe that

21:04.340 --> 21:10.380
accountability and careful oversight comes before blind trust and the thrill of profit,

21:10.380 --> 21:17.780
and a reminder to long-standing institutions that nothing is eternal.

21:17.780 --> 21:21.380
Lyssen's life has been consistently strange since his imprisonment.

21:21.380 --> 21:25.060
Being somewhat of a household name for older generations, he has dipped in and out of the

21:25.060 --> 21:55.020
public eye, even competing in the 2018 season of Celebrity Big Brother.

21:55.020 --> 22:00.540
So that my friends is the wild and twisting story of Nick Lyssen, a story of how one man

22:00.540 --> 22:07.020
got himself into an ever deeper hole until he destroyed the oldest bank in England.

22:07.020 --> 22:12.180
