00:00.000 --> 00:08.600
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion. While the world waits for a physical MMA fight

00:08.600 --> 00:13.560
between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, we're being treated with an online fight first.

00:13.560 --> 00:19.040
The crazy South African and the subdued robot man go head to head in the social media space.

00:19.040 --> 00:24.320
The drama really started back in October of 2022, when Twitter just kept tripping over

00:24.320 --> 00:29.720
ever since Elon Musk took over. Soon, problems with Twitter's verification was causing

00:29.720 --> 00:34.960
chaos in the real world. Stock markets became confused, they could not tell the difference

00:34.960 --> 00:39.680
between the Twitter account of a real company or just some troll online. Individual stocks

00:39.680 --> 00:44.280
flash-crashed as bizarre announcements were made by trolls pretending to be the PR department

00:44.280 --> 00:51.200
of a company. Twitter also saw a haphazard firing process, lawsuits, bots, advertisers

00:51.200 --> 00:56.040
leaving, and just generally, nobody really knew what was going on. But over in the other

00:56.040 --> 01:01.360
corner, Zuckerberg was watching all of this closely, and he was waiting.

01:01.360 --> 01:06.040
You see, as the Twitter chaos was unfolding, many users switched to other microblogging

01:06.040 --> 01:12.880
sites like Mastodon, Tumblr, and HiveSocial. Meta employees saw this as a golden opportunity,

01:12.880 --> 01:19.640
and in January 2023, they began developing an app, which they called Project92. Project92

01:19.640 --> 01:25.200
would later become Threads, and on June 9th, 2023, in a meeting with employees, Meta's

01:25.200 --> 01:30.280
chief product officer, Chris Cox, would say, quote, we've been hearing from creators and

01:30.280 --> 01:35.480
public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, end quote.

01:35.480 --> 01:42.040
It was a stab at Elon. On the 5th of July, Threads is launched. The public was skeptical,

01:42.040 --> 01:47.440
but to the shock of everyone, within just one day, Threads reaches 30 million users.

01:47.440 --> 01:53.280
For context, Twitter took four years to reach the same number. Elon was furious and decides

01:53.280 --> 01:59.960
to sue Mark. July 6th, 2023, Zuckerberg does something unexpected. After not tweeting in

01:59.960 --> 02:05.840
11 years, he taunts Mark with a meme. Within five days, Threads would have 100 million users,

02:05.840 --> 02:10.640
about 30% of Twitter's user base, and at the same time, Twitter's traffic began tanking.

02:10.640 --> 02:16.280
After this, Mast begins berating Zuckerberg on Twitter. It looks like things are getting heated,

02:16.280 --> 02:21.560
but what is all the fuss about? Is Threads really that big of a threat to Twitter? Obviously,

02:21.680 --> 02:26.600
these 100 million sign-ups on Threads is all just hype right now. But what happens next?

02:26.600 --> 02:31.400
What about the risk of a meta-monopoly? And what about security concerns? In this episode,

02:31.400 --> 02:35.280
we'll take a look. But also in this story, there's a detail that I haven't heard many

02:35.280 --> 02:41.240
other people talk about. Meta plans to use an open, decentralized technology. You could theoretically

02:41.240 --> 02:45.600
write a post on Facebook, see it on Twitter, or comment on an Instagram post and see it on

02:45.600 --> 02:50.440
TikTok. In short, apps become nothing but an interface skin to view social interactions.

02:51.160 --> 02:57.080
This is the biggest major change in social media in 15 years. But just because the technology is

02:57.080 --> 03:01.080
open doesn't mean that we should trust Zuckerberg. It's all very interesting and we'll get into

03:01.080 --> 03:15.480
that later. But first, let's start at the basics. So backing up, what is Threads? Threads is a

03:15.560 --> 03:20.520
Twitter clone for real-time updates and public conversations. The main difference at the moment

03:20.520 --> 03:26.360
is in its features and culture. On Twitter, anything goes. But on Threads, they're actively

03:26.360 --> 03:32.680
not going to encourage politics or hard news. Mark Zuckerberg's company Meta, hosting Facebook,

03:32.680 --> 03:37.240
Instagram and WhatsApp, has launched its own micro-blogging platform called Threads.

03:38.120 --> 03:44.200
Since its launch, Threads grew quickly. Within several hours, the platform amassed over 2 million

03:44.200 --> 03:49.720
users. After one day, it reached 30 million. And at this point, this made Threads the most

03:49.720 --> 03:56.040
rapidly downloaded app in history, surpassing the previous record set by ChatGPT. At the time of

03:56.040 --> 04:02.440
writing, Threads has over 100 million users, about 30% of what Twitter has. So the real reason for

04:02.440 --> 04:07.560
this fast adoption is not the fact that Threads is a better app than Twitter. It's more so that

04:07.560 --> 04:13.160
Zuckerberg has done something very clever. Twitter had to grow its user base from scratch,

04:13.160 --> 04:17.800
but with Threads, people who use Instagram can simply just sign up to Threads using their

04:17.800 --> 04:22.280
existing account and they can bring along their followers and verification. Getting people to

04:22.280 --> 04:29.880
download and sign up for a brand new social media platform is hard. Instagram has 2.3 billion users.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.840
Launching Threads through Instagram reduces a lot of friction.

04:37.400 --> 04:41.880
So to sum up the culture on Threads, it's pretty boring, at least when compared to Twitter.

04:41.880 --> 04:46.760
It seems like Threads is controlled and on guardrails. There's not much of that random chaos

04:46.760 --> 04:51.160
that you see on Twitter, whether that be wacky entertaining posts or bots and spam.

04:51.800 --> 04:57.640
On Threads, Zuckerberg has stated, quote, the goal is to keep it friendly as it expands. I think

04:57.640 --> 05:02.760
it's possible and will ultimately be the key to success. That's one reason why Twitter never

05:02.760 --> 05:07.720
succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently. In the end,

05:07.720 --> 05:12.840
we could see both platforms coexisting but for different reasons. Twitter is more edgy and

05:12.840 --> 05:17.880
chaotic, whereas Threads, once established and with more features, is a calmer, more corporate

05:17.880 --> 05:23.160
place for discourse. And also, thanks to Instagram, Threads will have the unique advantage of a

05:23.160 --> 05:27.960
generally younger audience and an audience that may come from geographical regions that don't use

05:27.960 --> 05:35.320
Twitter. As for Threads right now, it functions solidly. It works smooth and is familiar. However,

05:35.320 --> 05:41.000
it is missing a lot of features. There's no trending news, no DMs, and no strong recommendation

05:41.000 --> 05:45.880
algorithm, a feature that will be essential to its long-term success, but it's still early days.

05:48.760 --> 05:53.400
So who could come out on top here? Well, looking at corporate history, it's not looking good for

05:53.400 --> 05:59.160
Elon. Elon and Zuckerberg come from opposite ends of business. Elon's experience lies in

05:59.160 --> 06:03.480
delivering physical products. It's more of a mechanical engineering and mechatronics vein.

06:03.560 --> 06:09.800
On the other hand, since 2004, Zuckerberg has basically grown up building social networks.

06:10.360 --> 06:15.080
He sure likes to mine our data, but one thing he has got in spades is experience.

06:16.520 --> 06:21.560
On the other hand, Elon Musk's inexperience in this area is starting to show. Twitter is having

06:21.560 --> 06:26.600
a hard time monetizing. A report by Insider Intelligence is predicting a massive slump in

06:26.600 --> 06:32.360
Twitter's ad revenue by the end of the year. To make up for it, longer tweets, longer videos,

06:32.360 --> 06:38.120
and verification are all now behind paywalls. Even TweetDeck is behind a paywall. This kind of

06:38.120 --> 06:42.520
behavior from Twitter is in line with being a monopoly. They had the biggest platform in the

06:42.520 --> 06:47.720
space, so they could bump up costs at will, and users had virtually no choice but to take it.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.960
Even though some did try to move to smaller, similar platforms, there wasn't enough of a

06:51.960 --> 06:57.080
network effect to challenge Twitter. Now with meta and threads in the picture, this is all going to

06:57.080 --> 07:03.640
change. Zuck has led a team whose expertise is in platform monetization, and meta may be able

07:03.640 --> 07:08.360
to figure out what Twitter couldn't. Although threads will not have ads until 1 billion users,

07:08.360 --> 07:12.360
meta already has a good and established relationship with advertising clients.

07:13.560 --> 07:18.120
Threads is also seeing more user engagement than Twitter, which bodes well for advertisers.

07:18.600 --> 07:27.800
Even though Twitter does have a new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, Musk would still tweet business decisions

07:27.800 --> 07:32.440
that would make investors nervous. Without warning, he decided to limit the number of tweets that

07:32.440 --> 07:39.160
users can see. Many Twitter users reported problems. Accessing the site to date after Elon Musk said

07:39.160 --> 07:43.320
he's putting a limit on the number of tweets users can read per day.

07:43.320 --> 07:47.000
Elon said that this was to stop bot scraping. But there might be more to this.

07:47.640 --> 07:53.320
Back in March, Musk refused to pay $70 million in fees to Amazon Web Services,

07:53.320 --> 07:56.440
the company that provides Twitter with the infrastructure to run.

07:56.440 --> 08:01.480
Twitter is also being fined $100,000 because Elon isn't paying the company's rent,

08:01.480 --> 08:05.640
as he believes that it's not worth it in San Francisco. So if the trends are anything to go

08:05.640 --> 08:10.280
by and Amazon Web Services isn't being paid again, it's possible that they've been throttling

08:10.280 --> 08:14.600
data usage for Twitter. And this could be the real reason behind limiting the views for tweets.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.320
So all in all, it looks like, purely from a business technical ability,

08:19.320 --> 08:23.000
Zuck seems to have the upper hand here. But again, anything could happen.

08:24.280 --> 08:25.800
So let's take a look at this lawsuit.

08:26.760 --> 08:32.200
Twitter is reportedly threatening to sue Metta over its new Threads platform.

08:32.200 --> 08:36.280
News outlets say a lawyer for Twitter has sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.200
After the initial success of Threads, Musk made his thoughts clear.

08:40.760 --> 08:41.400
Quote,

08:41.400 --> 08:45.880
Competition is fine, cheating is not. In a legal letter to Zuckerberg,

08:45.880 --> 08:48.280
Twitter would accuse them of, quote,

08:48.280 --> 08:54.040
systematic, willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual

08:54.040 --> 08:57.320
property. It's going to be a hard case. And according to Polk Wagner,

08:57.320 --> 09:00.600
a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, quote,

09:00.600 --> 09:05.320
Twitter also needs to show that Threads took information that was economically valuable

09:05.320 --> 09:08.280
and which the company had taken responsible efforts to keep secret.

09:08.840 --> 09:14.040
Twitter had also claimed that Metta had taken ex-employees who, quote,

09:14.040 --> 09:18.600
had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential

09:18.600 --> 09:22.920
information, end quote. And they called Threads a, quote, copycat app.

09:23.640 --> 09:28.040
Ironically, Musk had previously tweeted that the geniuses that he fired should be able to

09:28.040 --> 09:32.920
find jobs elsewhere. A Metta spokesperson, Andy Stone, would rebut, quote,

09:32.920 --> 09:37.960
No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee. That's just not a thing, end quote.

09:42.200 --> 09:46.520
So in this whole story, Zuckerberg is coming out looking like the more measured one here.

09:47.400 --> 09:50.760
It does seem like after his hearings and podcast appearances,

09:50.760 --> 09:54.600
the general public's impression of him has improved. But we shouldn't forget Cambridge

09:54.600 --> 09:58.840
Analytica and how Facebook collected personal data from millions of users,

09:58.840 --> 10:03.480
some of which was used for political advertising. This isn't to mention the countless other

10:03.480 --> 10:09.800
scandals that Metta has been embroiled in. And also around 32% of the world's population

10:09.800 --> 10:15.720
is on Instagram and soon every world leader could be on Threads. Metta has the GDP and influence

10:15.720 --> 10:20.680
over populations that most governments would dream of. Metta platforms knows your personality,

10:20.680 --> 10:25.720
political stances, who you're friends with, all to serve you better ads. But this knowledge and

10:25.720 --> 10:30.840
data can be abused in many ways, sold for profit, or to cause political influence.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.840
To add to this, former Facebook staff have previously warned that Zuckerberg has way too

10:36.840 --> 10:41.880
much controlling power within his companies. Threads has so much tracking and user profiling

10:41.880 --> 10:46.040
that it goes beyond what's allowed by EU data laws. That should tell you something.

10:50.600 --> 10:54.440
Okay, so here's the really interesting bit. While everyone is talking about the massive

10:54.440 --> 10:59.960
sign-up rate of Threads, there's another story going on here. Metta plans to use a forgotten

10:59.960 --> 11:06.360
2018 decentralized web technology called ActivityPub. So, what is ActivityPub?

11:06.360 --> 11:09.640
David Pierce from The Verge sums it up perfectly.

11:36.360 --> 11:59.240
I was there in the early days of the web and this whole thing with ActivityPub is as big a deal

11:59.240 --> 12:04.920
as HTML was back then. This is the single biggest opportunity I've seen for the web

12:04.920 --> 12:11.080
since the dawn of the web. This is the biggest change in social media in 15 years.

12:13.240 --> 12:17.400
The new wave of social media companies that use this kind of decentralized protocol are

12:17.400 --> 12:22.840
collectively known as the Fediverse. Unfortunately, Metta may use the technology for their own gain.

12:22.840 --> 12:28.840
The really only thing about Threads that has me interested is their ActivityPub integration,

12:28.840 --> 12:33.000
so that people on Instagram Threads can interact with people on the Fediverse,

12:33.000 --> 12:37.880
something like Mastodon. I don't see Facebook approaching this in a way that's designed to

12:37.880 --> 12:43.320
break down walls and create a more open internet where platforms get to speak to each other

12:43.320 --> 12:48.840
for the benefit of the end user, you, which is the whole point of ActivityPub. Alternatively,

12:48.840 --> 12:53.960
I think Facebook will more likely want to use ActivityPub as free content for its own walled

12:53.960 --> 12:58.520
garden platform. Many people like myself are pretty much only on Mastodon and if someone like

12:58.520 --> 13:03.240
myself refuses to open a Threads account, it won't really impact Facebook since people can

13:03.240 --> 13:08.680
still theoretically follow my Mastodon from those threads. I think this ActivityPub aspect is an

13:08.680 --> 13:14.120
important area of the story to keep your eye on. If Threads is successful and using ActivityPub,

13:14.120 --> 13:19.080
Zuckerberg theoretically could create as many clones of different standalone apps that he wants

13:19.080 --> 13:25.560
with ease. The CEO of Mastodon, a Twitter competitor who also uses ActivityPub, thinks that Metta

13:25.560 --> 13:28.200
may embrace ActivityPub only to destroy it.

13:31.560 --> 13:37.640
I think the internet is like resetting. It feels to me more like 2011 than whatever we

13:37.640 --> 13:43.160
thought last year was going to be. All the big publishers are focusing now on email and direct

13:43.160 --> 13:48.200
home pages, which is fascinating. The social networks are splintering. We're seeing actual

13:48.200 --> 13:52.920
market share changes. None of this stuff was happening a year ago. Okay, maybe I have like

13:52.920 --> 13:58.760
three or four interest-based places that I go instead of one monolithic place. That's why

13:58.760 --> 14:04.600
decentralized social is interesting. And then for these companies, what makes it attractive

14:04.600 --> 14:09.720
is they get to farm out content moderation. They get to say to Congress or whoever else,

14:09.720 --> 14:14.200
look at all this competition. You can bring your own content moderation algorithm to the mix.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.360
We're only in charge if you want us to be. And I think that is utterly appealing to all of us.

14:19.320 --> 14:24.280
Cambridge Analytica was a warning. Today's social media companies are much bigger than

14:24.280 --> 14:29.960
they were then. And Zuckerberg is on his way to a social media app monopoly, with Facebook,

14:29.960 --> 14:36.840
Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and now threads all under his belt. If for any reason Metta was

14:36.840 --> 14:41.480
persuaded to block a trending topic or sway popular opinion, it's just that little bit

14:41.480 --> 14:45.560
easier for them to do now. What happens next is anyone's guess, but this should be looked at

14:45.560 --> 14:52.200
closely. As for Twitter, it's unlikely that it will die. But the game has changed. From a business

14:52.200 --> 14:56.840
perspective, there's a lot of new risk that's built up. If Elon says something crazy that

14:56.840 --> 15:01.560
offends people or something on Twitter breaks, users can now just jump to threads. It's going to

15:01.560 --> 15:06.680
be a slow grind, but the potential is there for a death by a thousand cut scenario for Twitter.

15:07.400 --> 15:12.440
So what's the final most probable outcome? Well, in my opinion, I think that once the

15:12.440 --> 15:17.960
initial hype dies down from threads, we could see both platforms coexist just with a different

15:17.960 --> 15:24.440
culture, different users, and different use cases. In the end, the biggest loser of all of this is

15:24.440 --> 15:29.560
going to be Linda, the new CEO of Twitter. She's definitely going to have her work cut out. And

15:29.560 --> 15:34.760
as a side point, imagine if all of this was just advertising for the upcoming boxing match between

15:34.760 --> 15:39.640
Musk and Zuckerberg. That would be pretty funny if that was true. Anyway, that's about it from me.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.400
