00:00.000 --> 00:02.320
This video is brought to you by Aura.

00:02.320 --> 00:05.440
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

00:05.440 --> 00:10.240
In 1770, Hungarian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kemplen

00:10.240 --> 00:15.360
built an unveiled a self-operating chess-playing machine called the Mechanical Turk.

00:15.360 --> 00:21.440
In demonstrations around Europe, his chess-playing invention won most of its games against actual human chess players

00:21.440 --> 00:26.240
and it's even said that it went on to beat players like Napoleon and Benjamin Franklin.

00:26.320 --> 00:30.160
Naturally, the invention was extremely popular, a marvel of its day.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.040
However, it was actually just some guy under the table secretly operating the machine.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.800
In other words, it was a hoax.

00:37.680 --> 00:42.320
Some 250 years later, in 2016, Amazon pulled a similar stunt.

00:42.320 --> 00:47.920
Their checkout system, called Just Walk Out, allowed customers to simply grab items from the store and leave.

00:48.720 --> 00:53.120
Under this system, customers didn't have to manually scan their items at the checkout.

00:53.120 --> 00:58.240
The transactions and logistics were automatically taken care of behind the scenes by AI.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.800
An elegant combination of computer vision, sense of fusion, and deep learning.

01:02.800 --> 01:03.440
Or was it?

01:04.000 --> 01:07.440
Just like the Mechanical Turk, all was not as it seemed.

01:07.440 --> 01:12.560
Amazon's so-called AI technology was actually powered by a thousand people in India

01:12.560 --> 01:15.760
watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate checkouts.

01:15.760 --> 01:21.040
Now, human's labeling data is often how AI models are first trained and that's fine.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.680
But the point is, the advertising was misleading.

01:24.320 --> 01:30.880
Even by 2022, these 1,000 people were still manually reviewing 70% of transactions

01:30.880 --> 01:36.400
in 20 Amazon Go stores, 40 Amazon Fresh Grocery stores, and two Whole Foods stores.

01:38.480 --> 01:43.040
Although some saw it as dystopian, Amazon promoted their Just Walk Out technology

01:43.040 --> 01:46.240
as a utopian magical solution powered by AI.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.920
And herein lies the problem.

01:47.920 --> 01:51.280
Companies often leave out critical information in the fine print.

01:51.280 --> 01:56.400
It wasn't until 2023 that Amazon mentioned the use of the 1,000 people in India.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.600
And it gets worse.

01:57.600 --> 02:01.680
According to a report by the information, other companies were swindled too.

02:01.680 --> 02:07.600
Quote, 30 stores operated by other companies in the US, sports stadiums, 12 airports,

02:07.600 --> 02:11.040
and one university all used Amazon's Walk Out technology.

02:12.080 --> 02:14.080
And this is where things become murky.

02:14.080 --> 02:18.000
When companies promise revolutionary technology, but don't follow up on them,

02:18.000 --> 02:23.200
it creates distrust, but it can even spoil it for those who are doing legitimate work in the field.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.400
With the AI revolution that we've seen over the past couple of years,

02:26.400 --> 02:29.680
there needs to be a more critical look at what's happening with AI.

02:29.680 --> 02:33.840
In this episode, we'll see the reasons for the AI hype and its consequences.

02:33.840 --> 02:38.480
We'll look at if there is indeed an AI bubble and what real-world impact that might be having.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.440
This includes companies releasing half-baked AI products,

02:41.440 --> 02:45.120
but also simultaneously replacing actual humans with AI.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.200
It's a dichotomy of an industry, so sit back and relax as we make sense of it all.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.960
One use of AI technology that absolutely nobody is thrilled about

03:00.960 --> 03:03.520
is the fact that it can make scammers' lives easier.

03:03.520 --> 03:07.920
AI can help generate convincing texts that try to trick you into clicking a phishing link.

03:07.920 --> 03:10.640
And then there's the spam emails and robocalls.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.120
You've all experienced it, but why does it happen?

03:13.120 --> 03:15.840
It's because your information has been sold to data brokers.

03:15.840 --> 03:19.920
They're making a fortune from selling your information to robocallers and scammers.

03:19.920 --> 03:24.320
They can know a lot about you, including your name, phone number, and address.

03:24.320 --> 03:28.480
But there's a simple way to stop this. That's where today's sponsor, Aura, comes in.

03:28.480 --> 03:33.040
They can identify data brokers and submit opt-out requests on your behalf.

03:33.040 --> 03:36.640
Brokers are legally required to remove your information if you ask them to,

03:36.640 --> 03:38.640
but they make it super hard to do.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.080
Let Aura handle that for you.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.880
Aura also does so much more to protect you and your family from online threats that you can't see.

03:44.880 --> 03:48.480
It's really easy to set up, so you don't have to download several different apps

03:48.480 --> 03:53.520
to get things like parental controls, antivirus, a VPN, password management,

03:53.520 --> 03:55.520
identity theft insurance, and more.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.760
And you get everything at one affordable price.

04:04.800 --> 04:05.920
Okay, so let's continue.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.880
No, it's not just you.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.080
The term AI is really being thrown around everywhere.

04:14.080 --> 04:19.040
For older Cold Fusion viewers, you'd know that I've been covering AI for the good part of a decade now.

04:19.040 --> 04:25.520
Before 2022, the word artificial intelligence was limited to industry verbiage and obscure research papers.

04:25.520 --> 04:28.240
The general public didn't know or care.

04:28.240 --> 04:34.640
And even as late as 2021 when I covered GPT-3, there was a lot of people that thought I was just making it up.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.360
How could a computer possibly talk like that?

04:37.360 --> 04:42.640
Well, as you all know, after 2022, especially following the launch of chat GPT,

04:42.640 --> 04:43.760
it was a different story.

04:44.320 --> 04:48.080
From your smartphone to LinkedIn to your local government site,

04:48.080 --> 04:51.760
a lot of organizations today will boast the term powered by AI.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.800
While in a lot of cases it makes sense, the overuse of the term

04:56.800 --> 05:01.520
and it being thrown around so casually is a symptom of something called AI washing.

05:01.920 --> 05:07.200
AI washing, simply put, is when companies create a fake buzz and mislead investors by

05:07.200 --> 05:13.280
providing manipulative information about the capabilities, limitations, or risks of their AI products,

05:13.280 --> 05:16.960
or simply wholesale lie about how and when they're using AI.

05:16.960 --> 05:24.640
According to Goldman Sachs, a record 36% of S&P 500 companies mentioned AI in their Q4 earnings reports.

05:24.640 --> 05:29.840
If the biggest companies in the world are hyping it up, there's no doubt that smaller companies are following suit

05:30.800 --> 05:33.680
and some without tangible results backing up their claims.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.160
And the investments are there to match too.

05:36.160 --> 05:41.680
From 2015 to 2022, global corporate AI investments have increased seven times.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.000
A lot of companies have seen tremendous growth in the recent AI hype,

05:46.000 --> 05:49.600
and this puts pressure on other companies to integrate AI into their business model

05:49.600 --> 05:51.440
or their products in order to compete.

05:51.440 --> 05:53.760
And that's even if it's not really AI.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.440
Monkey see, monkey do.

05:56.320 --> 06:00.800
For example, the Canadian investment firm, Delphia, claimed that it had built an AI to

06:00.800 --> 06:06.160
predict upcoming companies and industry trends, despite not having any such capabilities.

06:06.160 --> 06:11.600
The SEC caught wind of the scam and has since ordered them to pay US$225,000,

06:11.600 --> 06:15.120
and this was for false advertising and misleading statements about the use of AI.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.120
And I have a feeling that this is just the start.

06:18.080 --> 06:22.960
I previously talked about the Wirecard fraud, where CEO Marcus Braun boasted about having

06:22.960 --> 06:26.800
advanced proprietary AI throughout their fintech products and services.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.680
In reality, it was just spreadsheets.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.480
In the end, there was $2 billion missing from the books,

06:32.480 --> 06:34.400
but that was a story for a different day.

06:34.400 --> 06:38.080
You might have also heard about the NPU, or Neural Processing Unit.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.280
It's a dedicated processor specifically designed for AI tasks, among other things.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.680
They're becoming increasingly common in the world of PCs and laptops,

06:47.680 --> 06:52.400
and Microsoft has even claimed that we're now in the age of the AI PC,

06:52.480 --> 06:56.720
but recent reviews of the current crop of these products have left consumers with a bad taste

06:56.720 --> 06:57.520
in their mouth.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.520
Let's talk a bit more about AI.

06:59.520 --> 07:04.560
Yes, the Snapdragon processors dominate here, but AI is still very nascent.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.280
Many people either won't use these tasks or that much,

07:07.280 --> 07:10.480
or these tasks themselves just don't work that well yet.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.520
For example, they demoed generating images of animals,

07:13.520 --> 07:16.720
and they highlighted how fast the processors were versus Intel.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.640
But when I looked closely at the images generated, they were all garbage.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.360
The AI dogs all had very lopsided eyes.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.640
So who cares if one of these processors is faster than the other

07:26.640 --> 07:28.640
if they are both generating garbage?

07:28.640 --> 07:33.040
Right now, I just wouldn't advise anyone buy a laptop based on its AI capabilities.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.280
A news analyst from Computerworld has mentioned that these AI PCs

07:37.280 --> 07:39.440
aren't, quote, all they're cracked up to be.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.280
And if you're expecting something transformative when you buy one from the start of 2024,

07:43.280 --> 07:44.640
you're going to be disappointed.

07:44.640 --> 07:48.960
They might one day deliver a lot of cool features, just not yet, end quote.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.000
But are there consequences of such misplaced promises,

07:52.000 --> 07:54.080
other than distrust from customers?

07:54.080 --> 07:58.240
Companies that missed the mark with AI product launches are constantly trying to save face.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.160
Even the most popular companies in the world are not immune to mistakes.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.640
Perhaps the biggest consequence of AI washing is a certain B word

08:06.640 --> 08:08.240
that might be lurking around the corner.

08:11.280 --> 08:15.440
Almost as soon as AI started going Uber mainstream from late 2022,

08:15.520 --> 08:19.280
a lot of people immediately likened the phenomenon to the dot-com bubble

08:19.280 --> 08:20.960
or even the crypto fiasco.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.200
In fact, some people still do today.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.840
Even when we talk about the dot-com bubble,

08:25.840 --> 08:28.000
it's not the world wide web that was the problem.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.160
Because of course, you're using it right now.

08:30.160 --> 08:33.920
Instead, it was mostly the e-commerce side of things which overpromised,

08:33.920 --> 08:37.200
reeling in investors but under delivered, leading to a crash

08:37.200 --> 08:41.040
when everyone realized that the companies that they invested in weren't making any money.

08:41.040 --> 08:46.800
With AI, there's no doubt that we'll see some more investment in the space

08:46.800 --> 08:48.160
and monumental growth too.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.600
According to Oppenheimer, no, not the one you're thinking of,

08:51.600 --> 08:54.880
who's a chief global equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Research,

08:56.400 --> 09:00.320
we believe we are in the relatively early stages of a new technology cycle

09:00.320 --> 09:02.480
that is likely to lead to further outperformance.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.200
Nvidia, who designs the chips that are powering Big Tech's AI revolution,

09:07.200 --> 09:08.800
is tentative proof of this.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.800
Their stock is up 80% this year alone, perhaps excessive,

09:12.800 --> 09:15.200
but it's indicative of what the market thinks of AI.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.880
Mark Cuban, who made his fortune during the dot-com era,

09:18.880 --> 09:20.720
also doesn't see AI as a bubble.

09:20.720 --> 09:22.560
In a recent interview with Lex Friedman,

09:22.560 --> 09:25.120
he expressed that the biggest sign that we're not in a bubble

09:25.120 --> 09:27.280
is the lack of IPOs in the AI sector.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.680
Also, the absence of companies with no intrinsic value going public

09:31.680 --> 09:35.520
and the lack of, quote, funky AI companies is a key indicator.

09:35.520 --> 09:39.200
He noted that the current market doesn't exhibit such characteristics,

09:39.200 --> 09:41.200
and I think that I largely agree with that.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.680
There's obviously some bad players in the industry

09:43.680 --> 09:45.520
who are just trying to make a quick buck,

09:45.520 --> 09:48.160
but there might be more to it, and here's what I mean.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.480
There's a known pattern for emerging technologies

09:50.480 --> 09:52.160
called the Gartner hype cycle.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.560
It describes how humans tend to be overzealous

09:54.560 --> 09:56.880
about a new revolutionary technology.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.440
We overestimate and overshoot its impact,

09:59.440 --> 10:01.440
hype it up until the market crashes,

10:02.160 --> 10:05.680
and after the crash, the real companies with the real value

10:05.680 --> 10:08.960
come through and spearhead the development of the new technology

10:08.960 --> 10:10.160
until it's mature.

10:10.160 --> 10:12.720
If we look at the Gartner hype cycle for AI,

10:12.720 --> 10:14.800
it seems like we're at the closing stages

10:14.800 --> 10:17.040
of the peak of inflated expectations

10:17.040 --> 10:19.840
and are slowly entering the trough of disillusionment.

10:19.840 --> 10:21.920
This interpretation of the current market

10:21.920 --> 10:24.320
means that there's going to be a lot of disappointment ahead.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.480
The real applications of AI will come after the hype and fatigue fades.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.040
But this time could be a little bit different

10:31.040 --> 10:35.280
because at its core, AI has the ability to mimic cognitive labour,

10:35.280 --> 10:38.400
a change that no previous technology has been able to do

10:38.400 --> 10:40.160
without intrinsic human intervention.

10:41.040 --> 10:44.320
Whereas, as pointed out in a previous podcast episode,

10:44.320 --> 10:46.560
during the dot-com bubble, there were a lot of people

10:46.560 --> 10:49.120
simply making a random website and going public

10:49.120 --> 10:51.120
and investors would throw money at anything

10:51.120 --> 10:52.800
with a dot-com at the end of its name.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.720
There's been a lot of organisations

10:58.720 --> 11:00.800
that have been rushing to launch AI products

11:00.800 --> 11:03.440
or replace humans with AI altogether.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.920
But the ones who are hastily adding the ever-popular,

11:05.920 --> 11:08.960
quote, powered by AI, gimmick, are failing badly

11:08.960 --> 11:11.760
and there have been some spectacular AI failures.

11:11.760 --> 11:15.040
For example, a parcel delivery firm called DPD

11:15.040 --> 11:17.760
enabled an AI online chat for answering questions.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.640
For one customer, it was not only useless

11:20.640 --> 11:23.040
at answering relevant questions regarding his order,

11:23.040 --> 11:27.200
but instead, when asked, it provided him with a poem and swore at him.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.400
This amazing poem came forth about a DPD chat pot.

11:30.400 --> 11:33.600
Who wasn't able to do anything? It was quite amazing.

11:33.600 --> 11:36.080
It appeared to even disregard its own rules

11:36.080 --> 11:39.680
and started swearing and even started dissing its own employer,

11:39.680 --> 11:43.360
adding, DPD is the worst delivery firm in the world.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.520
I would never recommend them to anyone.

11:46.160 --> 11:50.240
In Australia, a group of academics used AI-generated material

11:50.240 --> 11:51.680
as part of their complaint submission

11:51.680 --> 11:54.880
to the Australian Parliament against four of Australia's biggest banks.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.400
Of course, the AI made up a whole bunch of information,

11:58.400 --> 12:00.480
including scandals that never existed

12:00.480 --> 12:04.160
and implicating Deloitte when they had nothing to do with the original complaint.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.320
Someone on the team didn't read the entire submission

12:06.320 --> 12:07.920
before it went to the Australian Government,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.360
so it was a huge embarrassment

12:09.360 --> 12:11.200
and the academics were forced to apologise.

12:11.920 --> 12:13.600
This is just one of many examples

12:13.600 --> 12:15.120
and I'm going to include a website

12:15.120 --> 12:17.200
that keeps a running tab of these AI blunders.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.320
But on the other hand, there are companies

12:20.320 --> 12:22.400
who are integrating AI successfully.

12:23.120 --> 12:26.080
And this is where we come to the other kind of broken promise

12:26.080 --> 12:27.360
when it comes to AI.

12:27.360 --> 12:30.240
It's not CEO's over-promising AI's usefulness,

12:30.240 --> 12:31.600
but under-promising instead.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.440
In other words, we were told that AI would be our assistance

12:35.440 --> 12:37.520
and create new jobs, not replace us.

12:38.080 --> 12:39.440
But what if that's just not true?

12:40.320 --> 12:42.320
Not about replacing the human in the loop.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.040
In fact, it's about empowering the human.

12:45.040 --> 12:45.920
It's an assistant.

12:45.920 --> 12:46.560
It's an assistant.

12:46.560 --> 12:49.120
This clip from Satya is a bit hard to believe now,

12:49.120 --> 12:51.680
even though later he did mention the flip side.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.800
Yes, I'm sure a lot of us use ChatGPT

12:54.800 --> 12:57.200
to help get work done on personal projects,

12:57.200 --> 13:00.560
but AI eventually creating more jobs than it would replace.

13:00.560 --> 13:01.680
Maybe not so fast.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.280
You may have noticed that since 2022,

13:05.280 --> 13:07.600
there's been a lot of tech-related layoffs.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.360
The narrative is that this is happening

13:09.360 --> 13:12.080
due to the over-hiring during the pandemic times.

13:12.080 --> 13:15.440
And that would make sense for 2022 and even 2023,

13:15.440 --> 13:18.640
but in 2024, we're still seeing mass layoffs.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.680
Now, if companies were just struggling to make a profit,

13:21.680 --> 13:25.040
the explanation would be as simple as the common business cycle.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.920
But strangely, some of the biggest companies in the world

13:27.920 --> 13:29.280
are seeing record profits.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.200
They're almost cyclically shedding workers.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.000
According to reports,

13:34.000 --> 13:40.320
tech companies fired 165,000 people in 2022, 260,000 in 2023,

13:40.320 --> 13:44.960
and so far, the projection is 270,000 in 2024.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.720
So if companies are doing fine,

13:46.800 --> 13:49.120
why are workers being kicked out the door?

13:49.120 --> 13:52.400
Well, marketing professor and author Scott Galloway thinks,

13:52.400 --> 13:55.680
quote, there's something else going on, end quote.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.800
In his recent blog post dissecting the impact of AI

13:58.800 --> 14:01.440
on corporations, he mentions, quote,

14:01.440 --> 14:03.600
AI is playing a larger role in layoffs

14:03.600 --> 14:06.400
than CEOs are willing to admit, end quote.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.760
The normal way we think about job replacements caused by AI

14:09.760 --> 14:12.080
is that Joe Blogs is working at his computer,

14:12.080 --> 14:14.320
analyzing company figures or something like that.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.360
And then suddenly, the next day, he's replaced by an AI.

14:17.360 --> 14:20.000
But the truth is, it's a bit more nuanced than that.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.600
As companies slowly get better at understanding

14:23.600 --> 14:25.680
how AI can aid in their operations,

14:25.680 --> 14:28.640
they'll create better teams and structure with higher outcomes.

14:29.360 --> 14:32.400
Basically, instead of three people doing the work of three,

14:32.400 --> 14:35.440
you'll have one person doing the work of five with AI.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.000
The problem is that none of these companies

14:38.000 --> 14:39.200
are being sincere about it.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.560
Because if you're a CEO and you've been hyping up AI

14:42.640 --> 14:44.960
as the single greatest thing to happen to the industry,

14:44.960 --> 14:46.480
and then you follow it up with a memo

14:46.480 --> 14:49.040
that you've laid off 30% of your staff because of AI,

14:49.040 --> 14:50.720
the hypocrisy becomes clear.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.640
But in 2024, it seems like the truth is slowly coming out.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.240
And there's hints everywhere.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.360
IBM made headlines when CEO, Arvind Krishna,

14:59.360 --> 15:01.440
mentioned that they're planning to pause hiring roles

15:01.440 --> 15:03.280
that could be replaced with AI.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.960
Same with UPS, where recently their CEO, Carol Tom,

15:06.960 --> 15:10.080
acknowledged that AI is playing a part in employee layoffs.

15:10.080 --> 15:12.880
And this came after UPS had the largest layoff

15:12.880 --> 15:16.640
in its 116-year history, 12,000 workers.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.800
In both cases, spokespeople later clarified saying,

15:20.800 --> 15:24.400
quote, AI is not replacing workers, end quote,

15:24.400 --> 15:27.120
which is basically PR talk to save face.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.120
In fact, a Shopify employee

15:29.120 --> 15:30.800
broke their nondisclosure agreement

15:30.800 --> 15:34.240
to expose that the company has been secretly firing employees

15:34.240 --> 15:35.280
because of AI.

15:35.280 --> 15:38.880
The shift is even having an impact far outside the tech industry.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.200
TV and media producer Tyler Perry

15:41.200 --> 15:44.000
was building an $800 million studio expansion

15:44.000 --> 15:46.640
but paused its construction after he saw the results

15:46.640 --> 15:49.920
of open AISsora, an AI video generator.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.760
He made the remark, quote,

15:51.760 --> 15:54.480
I am very, very concerned that in the near future,

15:54.480 --> 15:57.200
a lot of jobs are going to be lost, end quote.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.520
In the last couple of years,

16:01.520 --> 16:03.520
you probably would have heard this phrase a bit.

16:03.520 --> 16:05.360
AI will not replace humans,

16:05.360 --> 16:08.320
but humans who utilize AI will replace humans who don't.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.320
There's definitely some truth to it,

16:10.320 --> 16:12.960
but some jobs will be at risk regardless.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.160
We don't have to imagine this.

16:14.160 --> 16:15.360
It is already happening.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.960
Megacaps like Meta and Alphabet,

16:16.960 --> 16:18.880
they are shrinking their workforces

16:18.880 --> 16:20.400
and shrinking their hiring.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.920
It's this idea that senior AI researchers or data analysts,

16:23.920 --> 16:25.760
they can do more with gen AI

16:25.760 --> 16:28.480
than an army of junior engineers who code.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.600
A recent report from McKinsey found that

16:31.600 --> 16:33.440
around 12 million U.S. workers

16:33.440 --> 16:35.600
may need to switch jobs by 2030.

16:35.600 --> 16:39.360
Lower-wage workers are 14 times more likely to be impacted.

16:39.360 --> 16:42.560
STEM, healthcare, builders, and professional fields

16:42.560 --> 16:44.160
will continue to add jobs,

16:44.160 --> 16:46.720
but generative AI could change work significantly

16:46.720 --> 16:49.360
for occupations like customer service and sales

16:49.360 --> 16:50.320
and office support.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.360
There's been repeated reports of how AI

16:53.360 --> 16:55.120
will be adding hundreds of millions of jobs

16:55.120 --> 16:56.080
in the next decade

16:56.080 --> 16:58.320
and how it's going to positively impact GDP.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.200
While by some miracle, this could happen.

17:01.200 --> 17:04.160
Right now, as has been the case many times in history,

17:04.160 --> 17:06.560
the train will leave the station without telling us.

17:06.560 --> 17:09.360
Whether we're aware to jump on board or not is the question.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.160
So wrapping this all up,

17:14.160 --> 17:16.000
I do have to mention that in no way

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
am I saying that all forms of AI

17:18.000 --> 17:21.120
and all of these giant corporations are elaborate hoaxes.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.640
In fact, on this channel,

17:22.640 --> 17:24.720
I've been making videos about AI progress

17:24.720 --> 17:26.400
for the better part of a decade now,

17:26.400 --> 17:29.520
and I've seen exponential progress right in front of my eyes,

17:29.520 --> 17:30.880
and so will many of you.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.400
We may have hit a temporary bottleneck

17:32.400 --> 17:33.520
when it comes to compute,

17:33.520 --> 17:36.240
but all it takes is a breakthrough in model efficiency

17:36.240 --> 17:37.760
and the curve continues upwards.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.040
But I just think that it's important

17:39.040 --> 17:40.560
to still have a cautious approach

17:40.560 --> 17:42.640
when it comes to looking at all sides of a story.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.640
I'm also working on a video

17:44.640 --> 17:47.680
that's all about the positive real-life impacts of AI,

17:47.680 --> 17:49.600
so hopefully that's going to balance things out a bit.

17:50.880 --> 17:53.360
So far, it seems like the promises of AI

17:53.360 --> 17:54.880
are yet to be fully realized.

17:54.880 --> 17:57.600
Whether that's creating and not taking jobs,

17:57.600 --> 17:59.040
solving global issues,

17:59.040 --> 18:02.240
or even providing us with a dependable AI customer service spot

18:02.240 --> 18:03.520
that doesn't swear at us.

18:03.520 --> 18:05.280
With such big and bold promises

18:05.280 --> 18:07.040
from these companies over the years,

18:07.040 --> 18:09.280
it's important for all of us to ask ourselves,

18:09.280 --> 18:11.280
do we have technological gold,

18:11.280 --> 18:12.560
a Trojan horse,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.880
or a chess master hiding under a table?

18:16.880 --> 18:18.720
Anyways, that's about it from me.

18:18.720 --> 18:19.760
My name is DeGogo,

18:19.760 --> 18:21.360
and you've been watching Cold Fusion.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.720
If you did like that episode,

18:22.720 --> 18:23.840
feel free to subscribe.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.680
There's plenty of other interesting stuff on the channel.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.000
All right, so I'll catch you again soon.

18:28.560 --> 18:29.200
Cheers, guys.

18:29.840 --> 18:30.480
Have a good one.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.000
Heaven help us make a better future.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.600
A better future.

18:40.720 --> 18:50.000
Heaven help us make a better future.

18:56.000 --> 18:56.880
Cold Fusion.

18:57.520 --> 18:58.000
It's missing.
