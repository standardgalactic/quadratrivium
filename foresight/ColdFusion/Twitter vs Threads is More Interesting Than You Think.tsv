0	8600	Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion. While the world waits for a physical MMA fight
8600	13560	between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, we're being treated with an online fight first.
13560	19040	The crazy South African and the subdued robot man go head to head in the social media space.
19040	24320	The drama really started back in October of 2022, when Twitter just kept tripping over
24320	29720	ever since Elon Musk took over. Soon, problems with Twitter's verification was causing
29720	34960	chaos in the real world. Stock markets became confused, they could not tell the difference
34960	39680	between the Twitter account of a real company or just some troll online. Individual stocks
39680	44280	flash-crashed as bizarre announcements were made by trolls pretending to be the PR department
44280	51200	of a company. Twitter also saw a haphazard firing process, lawsuits, bots, advertisers
51200	56040	leaving, and just generally, nobody really knew what was going on. But over in the other
56040	61360	corner, Zuckerberg was watching all of this closely, and he was waiting.
61360	66040	You see, as the Twitter chaos was unfolding, many users switched to other microblogging
66040	72880	sites like Mastodon, Tumblr, and HiveSocial. Meta employees saw this as a golden opportunity,
72880	79640	and in January 2023, they began developing an app, which they called Project92. Project92
79640	85200	would later become Threads, and on June 9th, 2023, in a meeting with employees, Meta's
85200	90280	chief product officer, Chris Cox, would say, quote, we've been hearing from creators and
90280	95480	public figures who are interested in having a platform that is sanely run, end quote.
95480	102040	It was a stab at Elon. On the 5th of July, Threads is launched. The public was skeptical,
102040	107440	but to the shock of everyone, within just one day, Threads reaches 30 million users.
107440	113280	For context, Twitter took four years to reach the same number. Elon was furious and decides
113280	119960	to sue Mark. July 6th, 2023, Zuckerberg does something unexpected. After not tweeting in
119960	125840	11 years, he taunts Mark with a meme. Within five days, Threads would have 100 million users,
125840	130640	about 30% of Twitter's user base, and at the same time, Twitter's traffic began tanking.
130640	136280	After this, Mast begins berating Zuckerberg on Twitter. It looks like things are getting heated,
136280	141560	but what is all the fuss about? Is Threads really that big of a threat to Twitter? Obviously,
141680	146600	these 100 million sign-ups on Threads is all just hype right now. But what happens next?
146600	151400	What about the risk of a meta-monopoly? And what about security concerns? In this episode,
151400	155280	we'll take a look. But also in this story, there's a detail that I haven't heard many
155280	161240	other people talk about. Meta plans to use an open, decentralized technology. You could theoretically
161240	165600	write a post on Facebook, see it on Twitter, or comment on an Instagram post and see it on
165600	170440	TikTok. In short, apps become nothing but an interface skin to view social interactions.
171160	177080	This is the biggest major change in social media in 15 years. But just because the technology is
177080	181080	open doesn't mean that we should trust Zuckerberg. It's all very interesting and we'll get into
181080	195480	that later. But first, let's start at the basics. So backing up, what is Threads? Threads is a
195560	200520	Twitter clone for real-time updates and public conversations. The main difference at the moment
200520	206360	is in its features and culture. On Twitter, anything goes. But on Threads, they're actively
206360	212680	not going to encourage politics or hard news. Mark Zuckerberg's company Meta, hosting Facebook,
212680	217240	Instagram and WhatsApp, has launched its own micro-blogging platform called Threads.
218120	224200	Since its launch, Threads grew quickly. Within several hours, the platform amassed over 2 million
224200	229720	users. After one day, it reached 30 million. And at this point, this made Threads the most
229720	236040	rapidly downloaded app in history, surpassing the previous record set by ChatGPT. At the time of
236040	242440	writing, Threads has over 100 million users, about 30% of what Twitter has. So the real reason for
242440	247560	this fast adoption is not the fact that Threads is a better app than Twitter. It's more so that
247560	253160	Zuckerberg has done something very clever. Twitter had to grow its user base from scratch,
253160	257800	but with Threads, people who use Instagram can simply just sign up to Threads using their
257800	262280	existing account and they can bring along their followers and verification. Getting people to
262280	269880	download and sign up for a brand new social media platform is hard. Instagram has 2.3 billion users.
269880	272840	Launching Threads through Instagram reduces a lot of friction.
277400	281880	So to sum up the culture on Threads, it's pretty boring, at least when compared to Twitter.
281880	286760	It seems like Threads is controlled and on guardrails. There's not much of that random chaos
286760	291160	that you see on Twitter, whether that be wacky entertaining posts or bots and spam.
291800	297640	On Threads, Zuckerberg has stated, quote, the goal is to keep it friendly as it expands. I think
297640	302760	it's possible and will ultimately be the key to success. That's one reason why Twitter never
302760	307720	succeeded as much as I think it should have, and we want to do it differently. In the end,
307720	312840	we could see both platforms coexisting but for different reasons. Twitter is more edgy and
312840	317880	chaotic, whereas Threads, once established and with more features, is a calmer, more corporate
317880	323160	place for discourse. And also, thanks to Instagram, Threads will have the unique advantage of a
323160	327960	generally younger audience and an audience that may come from geographical regions that don't use
327960	335320	Twitter. As for Threads right now, it functions solidly. It works smooth and is familiar. However,
335320	341000	it is missing a lot of features. There's no trending news, no DMs, and no strong recommendation
341000	345880	algorithm, a feature that will be essential to its long-term success, but it's still early days.
348760	353400	So who could come out on top here? Well, looking at corporate history, it's not looking good for
353400	359160	Elon. Elon and Zuckerberg come from opposite ends of business. Elon's experience lies in
359160	363480	delivering physical products. It's more of a mechanical engineering and mechatronics vein.
363560	369800	On the other hand, since 2004, Zuckerberg has basically grown up building social networks.
370360	375080	He sure likes to mine our data, but one thing he has got in spades is experience.
376520	381560	On the other hand, Elon Musk's inexperience in this area is starting to show. Twitter is having
381560	386600	a hard time monetizing. A report by Insider Intelligence is predicting a massive slump in
386600	392360	Twitter's ad revenue by the end of the year. To make up for it, longer tweets, longer videos,
392360	398120	and verification are all now behind paywalls. Even TweetDeck is behind a paywall. This kind of
398120	402520	behavior from Twitter is in line with being a monopoly. They had the biggest platform in the
402520	407720	space, so they could bump up costs at will, and users had virtually no choice but to take it.
407720	411960	Even though some did try to move to smaller, similar platforms, there wasn't enough of a
411960	417080	network effect to challenge Twitter. Now with meta and threads in the picture, this is all going to
417080	423640	change. Zuck has led a team whose expertise is in platform monetization, and meta may be able
423640	428360	to figure out what Twitter couldn't. Although threads will not have ads until 1 billion users,
428360	432360	meta already has a good and established relationship with advertising clients.
433560	438120	Threads is also seeing more user engagement than Twitter, which bodes well for advertisers.
438600	447800	Even though Twitter does have a new CEO, Linda Yaccarino, Musk would still tweet business decisions
447800	452440	that would make investors nervous. Without warning, he decided to limit the number of tweets that
452440	459160	users can see. Many Twitter users reported problems. Accessing the site to date after Elon Musk said
459160	463320	he's putting a limit on the number of tweets users can read per day.
463320	467000	Elon said that this was to stop bot scraping. But there might be more to this.
467640	473320	Back in March, Musk refused to pay $70 million in fees to Amazon Web Services,
473320	476440	the company that provides Twitter with the infrastructure to run.
476440	481480	Twitter is also being fined $100,000 because Elon isn't paying the company's rent,
481480	485640	as he believes that it's not worth it in San Francisco. So if the trends are anything to go
485640	490280	by and Amazon Web Services isn't being paid again, it's possible that they've been throttling
490280	494600	data usage for Twitter. And this could be the real reason behind limiting the views for tweets.
495400	499320	So all in all, it looks like, purely from a business technical ability,
499320	503000	Zuck seems to have the upper hand here. But again, anything could happen.
504280	505800	So let's take a look at this lawsuit.
506760	512200	Twitter is reportedly threatening to sue Metta over its new Threads platform.
512200	516280	News outlets say a lawyer for Twitter has sent a letter to Mark Zuckerberg.
516840	520200	After the initial success of Threads, Musk made his thoughts clear.
520760	521400	Quote,
521400	525880	Competition is fine, cheating is not. In a legal letter to Zuckerberg,
525880	528280	Twitter would accuse them of, quote,
528280	534040	systematic, willful and unlawful misappropriation of Twitter's trade secrets and other intellectual
534040	537320	property. It's going to be a hard case. And according to Polk Wagner,
537320	540600	a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, quote,
540600	545320	Twitter also needs to show that Threads took information that was economically valuable
545320	548280	and which the company had taken responsible efforts to keep secret.
548840	554040	Twitter had also claimed that Metta had taken ex-employees who, quote,
554040	558600	had and continue to have access to Twitter's trade secrets and other highly confidential
558600	562920	information, end quote. And they called Threads a, quote, copycat app.
563640	568040	Ironically, Musk had previously tweeted that the geniuses that he fired should be able to
568040	572920	find jobs elsewhere. A Metta spokesperson, Andy Stone, would rebut, quote,
572920	577960	No one on the Threads engineering team is a former Twitter employee. That's just not a thing, end quote.
582200	586520	So in this whole story, Zuckerberg is coming out looking like the more measured one here.
587400	590760	It does seem like after his hearings and podcast appearances,
590760	594600	the general public's impression of him has improved. But we shouldn't forget Cambridge
594600	598840	Analytica and how Facebook collected personal data from millions of users,
598840	603480	some of which was used for political advertising. This isn't to mention the countless other
603480	609800	scandals that Metta has been embroiled in. And also around 32% of the world's population
609800	615720	is on Instagram and soon every world leader could be on Threads. Metta has the GDP and influence
615720	620680	over populations that most governments would dream of. Metta platforms knows your personality,
620680	625720	political stances, who you're friends with, all to serve you better ads. But this knowledge and
625720	630840	data can be abused in many ways, sold for profit, or to cause political influence.
631640	636840	To add to this, former Facebook staff have previously warned that Zuckerberg has way too
636840	641880	much controlling power within his companies. Threads has so much tracking and user profiling
641880	646040	that it goes beyond what's allowed by EU data laws. That should tell you something.
650600	654440	Okay, so here's the really interesting bit. While everyone is talking about the massive
654440	659960	sign-up rate of Threads, there's another story going on here. Metta plans to use a forgotten
659960	666360	2018 decentralized web technology called ActivityPub. So, what is ActivityPub?
666360	669640	David Pierce from The Verge sums it up perfectly.
696360	719240	I was there in the early days of the web and this whole thing with ActivityPub is as big a deal
719240	724920	as HTML was back then. This is the single biggest opportunity I've seen for the web
724920	731080	since the dawn of the web. This is the biggest change in social media in 15 years.
733240	737400	The new wave of social media companies that use this kind of decentralized protocol are
737400	742840	collectively known as the Fediverse. Unfortunately, Metta may use the technology for their own gain.
742840	748840	The really only thing about Threads that has me interested is their ActivityPub integration,
748840	753000	so that people on Instagram Threads can interact with people on the Fediverse,
753000	757880	something like Mastodon. I don't see Facebook approaching this in a way that's designed to
757880	763320	break down walls and create a more open internet where platforms get to speak to each other
763320	768840	for the benefit of the end user, you, which is the whole point of ActivityPub. Alternatively,
768840	773960	I think Facebook will more likely want to use ActivityPub as free content for its own walled
773960	778520	garden platform. Many people like myself are pretty much only on Mastodon and if someone like
778520	783240	myself refuses to open a Threads account, it won't really impact Facebook since people can
783240	788680	still theoretically follow my Mastodon from those threads. I think this ActivityPub aspect is an
788680	794120	important area of the story to keep your eye on. If Threads is successful and using ActivityPub,
794120	799080	Zuckerberg theoretically could create as many clones of different standalone apps that he wants
799080	805560	with ease. The CEO of Mastodon, a Twitter competitor who also uses ActivityPub, thinks that Metta
805560	808200	may embrace ActivityPub only to destroy it.
811560	817640	I think the internet is like resetting. It feels to me more like 2011 than whatever we
817640	823160	thought last year was going to be. All the big publishers are focusing now on email and direct
823160	828200	home pages, which is fascinating. The social networks are splintering. We're seeing actual
828200	832920	market share changes. None of this stuff was happening a year ago. Okay, maybe I have like
832920	838760	three or four interest-based places that I go instead of one monolithic place. That's why
838760	844600	decentralized social is interesting. And then for these companies, what makes it attractive
844600	849720	is they get to farm out content moderation. They get to say to Congress or whoever else,
849720	854200	look at all this competition. You can bring your own content moderation algorithm to the mix.
854200	858360	We're only in charge if you want us to be. And I think that is utterly appealing to all of us.
859320	864280	Cambridge Analytica was a warning. Today's social media companies are much bigger than
864280	869960	they were then. And Zuckerberg is on his way to a social media app monopoly, with Facebook,
869960	876840	Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and now threads all under his belt. If for any reason Metta was
876840	881480	persuaded to block a trending topic or sway popular opinion, it's just that little bit
881480	885560	easier for them to do now. What happens next is anyone's guess, but this should be looked at
885560	892200	closely. As for Twitter, it's unlikely that it will die. But the game has changed. From a business
892200	896840	perspective, there's a lot of new risk that's built up. If Elon says something crazy that
896840	901560	offends people or something on Twitter breaks, users can now just jump to threads. It's going to
901560	906680	be a slow grind, but the potential is there for a death by a thousand cut scenario for Twitter.
907400	912440	So what's the final most probable outcome? Well, in my opinion, I think that once the
912440	917960	initial hype dies down from threads, we could see both platforms coexist just with a different
917960	924440	culture, different users, and different use cases. In the end, the biggest loser of all of this is
924440	929560	going to be Linda, the new CEO of Twitter. She's definitely going to have her work cut out. And
929560	934760	as a side point, imagine if all of this was just advertising for the upcoming boxing match between
934760	939640	Musk and Zuckerberg. That would be pretty funny if that was true. Anyway, that's about it from me.
