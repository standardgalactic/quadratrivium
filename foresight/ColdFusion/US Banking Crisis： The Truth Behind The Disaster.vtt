00:00.000 --> 00:06.220
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

00:06.220 --> 00:10.840
This is Forbes Magazine, on the 14th of February, 2023.

00:10.840 --> 00:15.500
The title of this particular article reads, America's Best Banks.

00:15.500 --> 00:20.580
An entity by the name of Silicon Valley Bank was ranked number 20 and has been on the list

00:20.580 --> 00:22.580
for five years in a row.

00:22.580 --> 00:31.280
In 1983, SVB was the 16th largest bank in the United States and had over $209 billion in assets.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.580
Yet, in a few short weeks, the bank would go up in flames over the course of a couple of days.

00:36.580 --> 00:44.080
Silicon Valley Bank's collapse set off a panic, not seen since the days of the financial meltdown of 2008.

00:44.080 --> 00:48.580
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is causing shockwaves across the entire business world.

00:48.580 --> 00:54.580
With the FDIC now in control, customers can access up to $250,000 on Monday.

00:54.580 --> 01:00.080
But as ABC's Jacqueline Lee explains, that's not enough for many companies left struggling to manage their finances.

01:00.080 --> 01:05.580
This week, and clients of Silicon Valley Bank are scrambling and imploring the federal government to step in

01:05.580 --> 01:11.080
to help recover uninsured deposits over $250,000.

01:11.080 --> 01:15.080
It's the largest bank failure since the financial crisis of 2008.

01:15.580 --> 01:23.580
The crash created a cascade of events. Some smaller regional banks lost the majority of their valuation and another has since collapsed.

01:23.580 --> 01:31.580
Companies such as Roblox, Vox Media and a whole host of Silicon Valley startups are scrambling to find the cash to pay their employees.

01:31.580 --> 01:36.080
Meanwhile, the UK government is at work trying to minimize the effects of the crash.

01:36.080 --> 01:42.580
And at the same time, the rest of the economy is trying to figure out what the long-term consequences of this disaster may be.

01:42.580 --> 01:47.580
This is the largest bank failure since 2008 and the second largest in history.

01:47.580 --> 01:53.080
But how did a bank go from making the list of the best banks to bankrupt in less than a month?

01:53.080 --> 01:57.080
What happens next? Is this the start of another financial crisis?

01:57.080 --> 02:00.080
Maybe not, but there are some risks.

02:00.080 --> 02:08.080
What everyone seems to have missed in this story is that it's more of a cautionary tale of mismanagement, incompetence and political lobbying.

02:08.080 --> 02:13.080
The bank's parent company, its CEO and CFO are all being sued for fraud.

02:13.080 --> 02:18.580
And the CEO lobbied Congress to remove the very laws that would have prevented this crash in the first place.

02:18.580 --> 02:21.580
This whole thing is a crazy story, so let's get into it.

02:32.580 --> 02:36.580
To understand the consequences of this crash, we need to know how it started.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.080
Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was no ordinary bank.

02:40.080 --> 02:44.080
It was the go-to institution for venture capital and tech startups.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.080
The bank enjoyed a healthy period of growth during the 2020 pandemic.

02:48.080 --> 02:54.080
Low interest rates and excessive money printing from the US Federal Reserve caused the tech sector to boom.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.080
Money was easy and investors were generous.

02:57.080 --> 03:01.080
At the time, startups were able to raise money easily due to cheap credit.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.080
Once the companies got that money, they needed somewhere to store it.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.580
This is where Silicon Valley Bank comes in.

03:07.580 --> 03:10.580
SVB was very popular among founders.

03:10.580 --> 03:18.580
In fact, nearly 50% of all United States startups have some deposits in Silicon Valley Bank.

03:18.580 --> 03:29.580
In 2021, SVB saw a massive influx in deposits, from around $61 billion at the end of 2019 to around $189 billion at the end of 2021.

03:30.080 --> 03:36.080
Now, SVB wanted to make a larger profit from all of this cash that they were suddenly sitting on.

03:36.080 --> 03:39.080
A safe investment would be long-term bonds.

03:39.080 --> 03:43.080
These are usually seen as safer than stocks and provide a steady return.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.080
Here's why.

03:44.080 --> 03:49.080
When interest rates are low, newly issued bonds pay lower interest rates or returns,

03:49.080 --> 03:53.080
making existing long-term bonds that pay higher more attractive.

03:53.580 --> 03:57.580
This leads to an increase in demand for these bonds and an increase in their price,

03:57.580 --> 04:00.580
so whoever's holding these long-term bonds makes money.

04:00.580 --> 04:08.580
SVB saw this situation and invested $80 billion of their tech company deposits in long-term bonds and other securities.

04:08.580 --> 04:11.580
They could then turn around and pay depositors a lower rate.

04:11.580 --> 04:18.580
The difference between the high rates from their long-term bonds and the cost of paying low rates for their deposits would be their profit.

04:18.580 --> 04:20.580
This arrangement works particularly well.

04:21.080 --> 04:29.080
Even if some clients decided to withdraw sooner, the bank can simply sell the bonds and get the liquidity necessary to pay back the depositor.

04:29.080 --> 04:33.080
But what happens when everyone wants to withdraw their money all at once?

04:33.080 --> 04:36.080
Silicon Valley Bank was about to find out.

04:37.080 --> 04:43.080
As we covered in a previous episode about the 2008 crisis and its aftermath that still affects us today,

04:43.080 --> 04:47.080
the post-crisis market isn't used to a high interest rate environment

04:47.080 --> 04:51.580
and higher interest rates could create risks in vulnerable areas of the financial system.

04:51.580 --> 04:56.580
The risk management team of SVB ignored this risk, but more on this later.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.580
Problems for SVB began brewing in late 2021.

05:01.580 --> 05:04.580
In the United States, inflation began to rise.

05:04.580 --> 05:11.580
Usually when this happens, the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates to slow the economy and counteract the inflation.

05:11.580 --> 05:15.580
But this time, the US Federal Reserve stood by and did nothing for a while.

05:15.580 --> 05:18.080
They told everyone that inflation was transitory.

05:18.080 --> 05:22.080
This turned out to be completely wrong, and when the Fed realized their mistake,

05:22.080 --> 05:26.080
they had to raise interest rates very quickly to make up for lost time.

05:26.080 --> 05:30.080
This whiplash in higher rates didn't allow time for the market to adjust.

05:30.080 --> 05:35.080
Meanwhile at SVB, their investing environment began to flip on its head.

05:35.080 --> 05:39.080
As the interest rates rose, the newly issued bonds began to pay higher interest rates

05:39.080 --> 05:43.080
and this made the older long-term bonds less attractive to investors.

05:43.580 --> 05:47.580
This resulted in a decline in demand, causing their prices to fall.

05:47.580 --> 05:53.580
SVB still owned tens of billions worth of these long-term bonds, so they were a sitting duck for risk.

05:55.580 --> 06:02.580
By the end of 2022, there were $15 billion in unrealized losses from the fall in long-term bond prices.

06:02.580 --> 06:08.580
Now, normally this isn't an issue, as if SVB held onto these bonds until maturity,

06:08.580 --> 06:10.080
they wouldn't lose anything.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.580
But this was not a normal time.

06:12.580 --> 06:17.080
In a higher interest rate environment, technology startups were struggling to get financing

06:17.080 --> 06:19.080
as credit began to dry up.

06:19.080 --> 06:23.080
These tech companies needed to dip into their cash to fund their operations.

06:23.080 --> 06:28.080
With startups being the main client for SVB, the deposits started to slow down,

06:28.080 --> 06:35.080
falling from $189 billion at the end of 2021 to $173 billion at the end of 2022.

06:35.080 --> 06:42.080
With every large withdrawal, SVB had to sell some of their long-term bonds to cover the transaction.

06:42.580 --> 06:46.580
For some time, the bank had enough liquidity to deal with these withdrawals.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.580
As time passed, the depositors continued to leave.

06:49.580 --> 06:54.580
On March 8th, 2023, SVB made a bombshell announcement.

06:54.580 --> 06:59.580
They were selling off their entire liquid bond portfolio worth over $21 billion.

06:59.580 --> 07:03.580
Until this point, the falling bond prices were only unrealized losses,

07:03.580 --> 07:05.580
that is, losses only on paper.

07:05.580 --> 07:10.580
But once sold, SVB took a $1.8 billion loss in the sale.

07:11.080 --> 07:14.080
To recoup some losses, management decided to raise some capital.

07:14.080 --> 07:19.080
While this seemed like a logical choice, this was a grave error from management.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.080
The timing could not have been worse.

07:21.080 --> 07:27.080
Just days before, Silvergate, a small crypto-focused bank, failed due to a similar issue.

07:27.080 --> 07:33.080
Although this failure had more to do with the exposure to the overall crypto market, and FTX in particular.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.080
But the root cause was the same.

07:35.080 --> 07:39.080
The bank had a lot of assets which had lost their value due to rising interest rates,

07:39.580 --> 07:44.580
and when withdrawals in the crypto market began to happen, they had no choice but to sell those assets.

07:44.580 --> 07:48.580
Each sale of the assets was at a lower price than when they bought it.

07:48.580 --> 07:51.580
Once the losses piled up, there was no turning back.

07:51.580 --> 07:55.580
Investors assumed that SVB was going down the same path.

07:55.580 --> 08:03.580
Fears over insolvency issues quickly spread, and this resulted in SVB's stock losing close to 60% of its value in one day.

08:04.080 --> 08:10.080
As all of this unfolded, many venture capital firms advised the founders of startups to pull their money out of SVB,

08:10.080 --> 08:13.080
further exacerbating the problem.

08:13.080 --> 08:18.080
By the end of March 9th, customers have withdrawn $42 billion,

08:18.080 --> 08:23.080
leaving the bank with a negative cash balance, about negative $958 million.

08:23.080 --> 08:29.080
The withdrawals were so heavy that it ended up crashing the bank's internal system, only creating more fear.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.080
Depositors had a reason to panic.

08:31.580 --> 08:36.580
In the United States, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC,

08:36.580 --> 08:40.580
the US government only guarantees refunds up to $250,000.

08:40.580 --> 08:48.580
Now the thing is, being a technology company-focused bank, 97% of SVB deposits exceeded this number.

08:48.580 --> 08:56.580
The value of Silicon Valley bank shares continued to be destroyed until its trading was suspended on the morning of March 10th.

08:57.080 --> 09:01.080
They tried to raise capital and failed, and then by midday on March 10th,

09:01.080 --> 09:06.080
the bank started to look for a company to bail them out, and no one wanted to touch them.

09:06.080 --> 09:09.080
Nobody knew the extent of the problem, so it was a risk.

09:09.080 --> 09:14.080
This culminated in SVB being shut down by the FDIC.

09:14.080 --> 09:19.080
This all happened on March 10th, less than two days after the crisis started.

09:19.080 --> 09:22.080
This was a spectacular failure on the side of management.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.080
They failed to adjust to a rising interest rate environment.

09:25.580 --> 09:31.580
And yes, the US Federal Reserve did get it wrong when they stated that inflation was only transitory.

09:31.580 --> 09:36.580
But SVB should have had a contingency plan just in case inflation did stick around.

09:36.580 --> 09:40.580
If any of you watching work in risk management, especially in banking,

09:40.580 --> 09:44.580
I'd love to hear from you in the comments below on what a contingency plan could have been.

09:44.580 --> 09:47.580
It seems that as soon as interest rates started rising,

09:47.580 --> 09:50.580
the bank could have began to offload their long-term treasuries

09:50.580 --> 09:53.580
and exchange them for bonds yielding higher interest to minimize their losses.

09:54.080 --> 09:59.080
Instead, it seems that they waited and sold all of their liquid long-term bonds at once,

09:59.080 --> 10:01.080
after the value had already fallen.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.080
As Bill Ackman states,

10:03.080 --> 10:07.080
quote, Silicon Valley Bank senior management made a basic mistake

10:07.080 --> 10:11.080
they invested short-term deposits in longer-term fixed-rate assets.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.080
So how could management do such a thing?

10:13.080 --> 10:17.080
Well, the story gets a bit wilder the more that you look.

10:17.580 --> 10:21.580
As people began to dig deeper into this crash,

10:21.580 --> 10:24.580
some new information painted a very worrisome picture.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.580
The chief risk officer for Silicon Valley Bank

10:27.580 --> 10:30.580
hightailed and left in April of 2022

10:30.580 --> 10:33.580
and wasn't replaced until January of 2023.

10:33.580 --> 10:38.580
This meant that the bank had no chief risk officer for eight months.

10:38.580 --> 10:41.580
This was precisely at the time when the downward feedback loop

10:41.580 --> 10:44.580
was accelerating from the higher interest rates.

10:45.080 --> 10:48.080
Just when the bank's portfolios needed to be re-balanced

10:48.080 --> 10:50.080
to account for higher interest rates,

10:50.080 --> 10:52.080
there was no one to oversee the process.

10:52.080 --> 10:56.080
In other words, the bank was a plane without a pilot during a storm.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.080
Just shocking.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.580
But it doesn't end there.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.080
Worse yet, Silicon Valley Bank's CAO

11:02.080 --> 11:05.080
was the CFO of none other than Lehman Brothers

11:05.080 --> 11:07.080
at the time of its crash.

11:07.080 --> 11:10.080
And he can't help but laugh at how ridiculous this next part is.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.080
The Federal Reserve Bank,

11:12.580 --> 11:15.580
The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco

11:15.580 --> 11:17.580
was in charge of supervising SVB

11:17.580 --> 11:19.580
and guess who was on the board?

11:19.580 --> 11:21.580
The CEO of SVB,

11:21.580 --> 11:23.580
Greg Becker.

11:23.580 --> 11:26.580
Greg was promptly yeeted from the board after the crash.

11:26.580 --> 11:30.580
Interestingly, the CEO, CFO and CMO of the bank

11:30.580 --> 11:34.580
sold a combined $4.4 million of company stock

11:34.580 --> 11:36.580
just weeks before SVB's decline.

11:36.580 --> 11:40.580
An SEC filing stated that the sale of the shares

11:41.080 --> 11:44.080
was, quote, automated and, quote, pre-planned.

11:44.080 --> 11:48.080
But it remains unclear if there was some foreknowledge of the collapse.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.080
Further to this, the bank's employees

11:50.080 --> 11:54.080
sieve their annual bonuses ranging from 12,000 to 140,000

11:54.080 --> 11:57.080
only hours before the bank's official crash.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.080
I can't allege implications of wrongdoing,

11:59.080 --> 12:01.080
but there may be a chance that the guys at the top

12:01.080 --> 12:03.080
knew something was coming.

12:03.080 --> 12:07.080
Right now, SVB is being sued for fraud by shareholders.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.080
The lawsuit states that the company

12:09.080 --> 12:11.580
failed to disclose how rising interest rates

12:11.580 --> 12:14.580
could leave the bank particularly susceptible to a bank run.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.580
A crash of SVB was indeed unique.

12:19.580 --> 12:23.580
A combination of rapid growth, bad risk management,

12:23.580 --> 12:27.580
low interest rates, excessive exposure to only one market

12:27.580 --> 12:30.580
and large deposits with no FDIC insurance

12:30.580 --> 12:32.580
have all led us to this point.

12:32.580 --> 12:36.580
But is this the start of something bigger for the financial system?

12:36.580 --> 12:38.580
Is it a Lehman moment?

12:39.080 --> 12:42.080
It may very well have been a Lehman moment for regional banks

12:42.080 --> 12:45.080
as they have similar characteristics to SVB.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.580
Their clients are businesses.

12:46.580 --> 12:49.080
They operate in a very limited number of fields

12:49.080 --> 12:52.080
and they all have some exposure to unrealized losses

12:52.080 --> 12:54.080
in this higher interest rate environment.

12:55.080 --> 12:58.080
Because of this, the stocks of First Bank Republic,

12:58.080 --> 13:01.080
Western Alliance Bank Corp and Westpac Bank Corp

13:01.080 --> 13:04.080
and other regional banks have all seen large declines.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.580
Some as much as 66% in a day.

13:06.580 --> 13:09.580
Many hedge funds have also started to short sell.

13:36.580 --> 13:41.580
The falls and the stock prices were so drastic

13:41.580 --> 13:44.580
that the trading of a slew of these banks had to be halted.

13:44.580 --> 13:46.580
Okay, so this next part is key.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.580
Right at this moment, the rest of the banking system

13:49.580 --> 13:51.580
seems to be largely unaffected,

13:51.580 --> 13:53.580
as one analyst at Barclays wrote,

13:53.580 --> 13:55.580
quote, deposit pressure.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.580
This means that the banks will not be able to sell

13:57.580 --> 13:59.580
their shares at the same time.

13:59.580 --> 14:02.580
This means that the banks will not be able to sell their shares

14:02.580 --> 14:04.580
at the same time.

14:04.580 --> 14:07.580
Quote, deposit pressure is the greatest for smaller banks,

14:07.580 --> 14:09.580
including regionals.

14:09.580 --> 14:12.580
Global banks have more diverse funding sources

14:12.580 --> 14:15.580
and therefore are less vulnerable to that risk.

14:15.580 --> 14:18.580
That being said, Bank of America does have large exposure

14:18.580 --> 14:21.580
to long-term bonds that are planned to be held to maturity.

14:21.580 --> 14:23.580
Though if they don't sell and actually hold these bonds

14:23.580 --> 14:26.580
to maturity, this shouldn't be a problem.

14:27.580 --> 14:29.580
Many are comparing this situation

14:29.580 --> 14:32.580
to that of the 2008 financial crisis.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.580
Yet this is quite different.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.580
During that time, some of the largest banks in the US

14:36.580 --> 14:38.580
all failed simultaneously

14:38.580 --> 14:40.580
and they had much bigger issues to deal with.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.580
These banks had sizable investments in assets

14:43.580 --> 14:45.580
that overnight became worthless.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.580
The assets that are responsible for the crash of SVB

14:48.580 --> 14:51.580
are not worthless, in fact, far from it.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.580
They're backed by the US government

14:53.580 --> 14:55.580
and if held to maturity, in theory,

14:55.580 --> 14:57.580
they're not going to lose any value.

14:57.580 --> 15:01.580
The problem for SVB is that they sold all of these bonds early

15:01.580 --> 15:03.580
and realized those losses, tried to raise funds

15:03.580 --> 15:06.580
to cover those losses and that triggered a panic.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.580
Another difference resides in the fact

15:08.580 --> 15:11.580
that the banks in 2008 had huge leverage issues.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.580
In the case of Lehman Brothers, for example,

15:13.580 --> 15:17.580
the leverage exceeded 30 times the underlying assets.

15:17.580 --> 15:21.580
In other words, a decline of 3-5% in those assets

15:21.580 --> 15:24.580
meant that Lehman Brothers was completely bankrupt.

15:24.580 --> 15:27.580
And lastly, the big banks have a far greater degree

15:27.580 --> 15:29.580
of diversification than regional banks.

15:29.580 --> 15:33.580
This means that they can withstand liquidity shocks more easily,

15:33.580 --> 15:37.580
as generally, not every single sector gets impacted at the same time.

15:37.580 --> 15:41.580
Not only this, but the bigger banks will probably benefit

15:41.580 --> 15:43.580
from the collapse of regional banks.

15:43.580 --> 15:45.580
Depositors may move their money from regional banks

15:45.580 --> 15:47.580
to larger institutions.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.580
And if there are more bank failures,

15:49.580 --> 15:51.580
the larger banks can simply gobble up the healthy parts

15:51.580 --> 15:53.580
for pennies on the dollar.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.580
Does this mean that the risk of a financial crisis

15:55.580 --> 15:57.580
is non-existent?

15:57.580 --> 15:59.580
Really, while the current financial system

15:59.580 --> 16:02.580
is very different from the one in 2008,

16:02.580 --> 16:04.580
there is still a chance that this may be the first crack

16:04.580 --> 16:07.580
in the fabrics of the current financial system.

16:07.580 --> 16:09.580
As of December 2022,

16:09.580 --> 16:12.580
the total unrealized losses for the whole banking system

16:12.580 --> 16:14.580
was close to $620 billion.

16:14.580 --> 16:16.580
If panic spreads too much,

16:16.580 --> 16:18.580
many small banks will go down as a result,

16:18.580 --> 16:20.580
creating a cascading effect

16:20.580 --> 16:22.580
that would cause the rest of the economy to wobble.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.580
The Federal Reserve and the financial sectors of the US government

16:25.580 --> 16:28.580
have recognized this and have come up with a solution,

16:28.580 --> 16:30.580
which we'll get to shortly.

16:32.580 --> 16:34.580
The industry that will feel the most pain

16:34.580 --> 16:36.580
is going to be the tech sector.

16:36.580 --> 16:39.580
SVB, quote, was the lifeblood of the tech ecosystem,

16:39.580 --> 16:41.580
states Ro Khanna,

16:41.580 --> 16:44.580
a congressman from California's 17th district.

16:44.580 --> 16:46.580
Tens of thousands of startups

16:46.580 --> 16:48.580
rely on them to pay their day-to-day operations,

16:48.580 --> 16:50.580
including staff.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.580
You see, unlike traditional businesses,

16:52.580 --> 16:55.580
many of these tech companies have negative cash flows.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.580
The only way that they can pay their expenses

16:57.580 --> 16:59.580
is by raising capital.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.580
After the capital has been obtained,

17:01.580 --> 17:04.580
they store it and use it until the next raise.

17:04.580 --> 17:06.580
If you take that stored money away,

17:06.580 --> 17:09.580
very quickly, many of these firms start to fail.

17:09.580 --> 17:12.580
Several firms aren't going to be able to pay their employees,

17:12.580 --> 17:15.580
and if there's further delays in when the money is returned,

17:15.580 --> 17:19.580
a huge wave of layoffs and then eventually bankruptcies will follow.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.580
Etsy had to delay their seller payouts.

17:21.580 --> 17:23.580
The streaming company, Roku,

17:23.580 --> 17:25.580
held a quarter of its cash reserves in SVB.

17:25.580 --> 17:29.580
Roblox, Rocket Lab, Circle, Vox Media, and Vimeo

17:29.580 --> 17:31.580
are among countless companies affected.

17:31.580 --> 17:35.580
The CEO of Y Combinator, Gary Tan, puts it best,

17:35.580 --> 17:38.580
quote, this is an extinction-level event for startups

17:38.580 --> 17:42.580
and will set back their innovation by 10 years or more.

17:42.580 --> 17:45.580
Confidence in the finance industry has been shaken.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.580
US banks lost a combined 100 billion

17:48.580 --> 17:51.580
and 50 billion for the valuation of European banks.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.580
On the 13th of March,

17:53.580 --> 17:56.580
Joe Biden had to reassure the United States population.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.580
Look, the bottom line is this.

17:58.580 --> 18:03.580
Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe.

18:03.580 --> 18:05.580
Your deposits are safe.

18:05.580 --> 18:08.580
Let me also assure you we will not stop at this.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.580
We'll do whatever is needed.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.580
The situation also spreads to the UK.

18:12.580 --> 18:16.580
The Bank of England was looking for ways to minimize the damage.

18:16.580 --> 18:19.580
The United Kingdom also had an arm of Silicon Valley Bank.

18:19.580 --> 18:21.580
Then, on March 13th,

18:21.580 --> 18:25.580
HSBC bought the stricken UK entity from measly one pound

18:25.580 --> 18:28.580
or one US dollar and 21 cents.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.580
At the height of the chaos,

18:30.580 --> 18:34.580
200 UK firms confirmed that they weren't going to be able to pay their staff.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.580
On the other side of the world,

18:36.580 --> 18:39.580
Chinese startups also reported issues accessing their funds.

18:39.580 --> 18:43.580
SVB was especially popular among Chinese biotech startups.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.580
As one founder explained,

18:45.580 --> 18:46.580
quote,

18:46.580 --> 18:48.580
We tried everything Friday morning,

18:48.580 --> 18:49.580
but it was already too late.

18:49.580 --> 18:51.580
The transfer is still processing.

18:51.580 --> 18:52.580
It's very crazy.

18:52.580 --> 18:54.580
We didn't think this could happen.

18:54.580 --> 18:55.580
For Chinese groups,

18:55.580 --> 18:59.580
their ecosystem was already damaged by Beijing's tech crackdown

18:59.580 --> 19:01.580
and COVID-19 pandemic controls,

19:01.580 --> 19:05.580
not to mention the rising geopolitical tensions with Washington.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.580
So in all of this,

19:09.580 --> 19:11.580
where were the regulators?

19:11.580 --> 19:13.580
Well, being lobbied apparently.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.580
Back in 2015,

19:15.580 --> 19:20.580
SVB CEO begged lawmakers to exempt banks with assets less than 250 billion

19:20.580 --> 19:24.580
from the tough supervision and regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.580
For those who remember my 2008 episode,

19:26.580 --> 19:31.580
this act was put into place to stop another financial crisis.

19:31.580 --> 19:35.580
In 2018, a bill was passed that weakened this act

19:35.580 --> 19:37.580
and Greg Becker got his wish.

19:37.580 --> 19:41.580
Sol Omarova, professor of law at Cornell University,

19:41.580 --> 19:45.580
who testified before the Senate against relaxing regulations for smaller banks,

19:45.580 --> 19:47.580
said that the 2018 bill, quote,

19:47.580 --> 19:49.580
should not have passed.

19:49.580 --> 19:51.580
And he was spot on.

19:53.580 --> 19:55.580
The dust has only just started to settle.

19:55.580 --> 19:58.580
Silicon Valley Bank is now under FDIC control

19:58.580 --> 20:01.580
and the FDIC has since moved SVB deposits

20:01.580 --> 20:03.580
to a newly formed holding bank

20:03.580 --> 20:06.580
and named Tim Mayopolis as CEO.

20:07.580 --> 20:09.580
On March 12, 2023,

20:09.580 --> 20:11.580
another regional bank signature bank collapsed.

20:11.580 --> 20:15.580
Meanwhile, signature bank marks the third largest bank failure in US history.

20:15.580 --> 20:18.580
Seeing more possible bank failures on the horizon,

20:18.580 --> 20:21.580
the Federal Reserve had to do something unprecedented.

20:21.580 --> 20:24.580
They announced the creation of a bank term funding program

20:24.580 --> 20:27.580
to shore up liquidity for other at-risk banks.

20:27.580 --> 20:31.580
They're allowing the affected banks to sell their long-term bonds and securities

20:31.580 --> 20:33.580
to the Fed without a loss.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.580
In another announcement on the same day,

20:35.580 --> 20:39.580
the Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC stated

20:39.580 --> 20:42.580
that all depositors, even the uninsured ones,

20:42.580 --> 20:45.580
will be made whole without the expenditure of taxpayer money.

20:45.580 --> 20:50.580
Some financial commentators have said that this is an inflationary move.

20:50.580 --> 20:54.580
A lot of regional banks who use the same style of banking as SVB

20:54.580 --> 20:58.580
saw worried depositors piling up outside to get their money out.

20:58.580 --> 21:01.580
The Fed and US government had to do these drastic moves

21:01.580 --> 21:04.580
to avoid bank runs and a cascade of bankruptcies.

21:05.580 --> 21:08.580
Nobody is a fan of government-assisted bailouts,

21:08.580 --> 21:10.580
but this is a tough situation.

21:10.580 --> 21:13.580
As Simon Johnson, an economist at MIT,

21:13.580 --> 21:17.580
who previously served as the chief economist of the IMF, says,

21:17.580 --> 21:18.580
quote,

21:18.580 --> 21:20.580
All choices are bad choices.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.580
You don't want to extend this kind of bailout to people,

21:22.580 --> 21:24.580
but if you aren't doing that,

21:24.580 --> 21:28.580
you face a run of really big and really hard-to-predict proportions.

21:29.580 --> 21:33.580
This is the largest banking failure since the financial crisis.

21:33.580 --> 21:36.580
If the Fed's creation of the bank term funding program

21:36.580 --> 21:38.580
isn't as smooth as promised or takes too long,

21:38.580 --> 21:42.580
the consequences for the companies around the US could be devastating.

21:42.580 --> 21:45.580
Even though I think the Federal Reserve does have some blame

21:45.580 --> 21:47.580
for the background macroeconomic situation,

21:47.580 --> 21:49.580
they did need to do something.

21:49.580 --> 21:52.580
Further to this, if the Federal Reserve reverses course

21:52.580 --> 21:54.580
and starts cutting interest rates,

21:54.580 --> 21:56.580
inflation could ramp up again.

21:56.580 --> 21:58.580
Causing even more havoc,

21:58.580 --> 22:01.580
they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.580
Raise rates, destroy the economy.

22:03.580 --> 22:06.580
Cut rates, also destroy the economy.

22:06.580 --> 22:11.580
With Silicon Valley holding 50% of US VC-backed startups as customers,

22:11.580 --> 22:15.580
65,000 startups would be affected by the collapse.

22:15.580 --> 22:19.580
Even if the government does succeed in making each depositor whole,

22:19.580 --> 22:21.580
it's a sad time for the tech sector,

22:21.580 --> 22:23.580
as confidence has been shaken.

22:23.580 --> 22:27.580
The nightmare of being locked out of company cash, delays in paying staff,

22:27.580 --> 22:31.580
and countless administration issues will leave a scar.

22:31.580 --> 22:36.580
In summary, this is a story of rapidly changing market conditions,

22:36.580 --> 22:39.580
risk management failure, and lobbying.

22:39.580 --> 22:41.580
But zooming out even further,

22:41.580 --> 22:45.580
this is exactly the kind of risk I was talking about in my 2008 episode.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.580
In the third section of that video,

22:47.580 --> 22:51.580
I talked about how unhealthy this economy has been ever since the crash,

22:51.580 --> 22:56.580
the post-crisis economy has been built on a scaffolding of easy money and low interest rates.

22:56.580 --> 22:58.580
When these conditions reverse,

22:58.580 --> 23:01.580
we'll start to see that weak scaffolding start to shake.

23:01.580 --> 23:04.580
What happened here is proof right in our faces.

23:04.580 --> 23:09.580
It will be the weaker and badly managed sectors of the economy that start to show it first.

23:09.580 --> 23:12.580
But what happens after that is anyone's guess.

23:12.580 --> 23:14.580
You should definitely watch that episode if you haven't already.

23:14.580 --> 23:16.580
I think you'll get a lot out of it.

23:16.580 --> 23:18.580
So this SVB story is still unfolding.

23:18.580 --> 23:22.580
We can only wait and see what the longer term impacts will be.

23:22.580 --> 23:24.580
So that's about it from me.

23:24.580 --> 23:25.580
Thanks for watching.

23:25.580 --> 23:28.580
If you did enjoy this, take a look around on the channel.

23:28.580 --> 23:30.580
There's plenty of interesting stuff on here.

23:30.580 --> 23:32.580
Alright, my name is DeGogo,

23:32.580 --> 23:34.580
and you've been watching Cold Fusion,

23:34.580 --> 23:36.580
and I'll catch you again soon for the next episode.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.580
Cheers guys.

23:38.580 --> 23:40.580
Have a good one.

23:48.580 --> 23:50.580
Thanks for watching.
