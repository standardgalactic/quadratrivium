0	6220	Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.
6220	10840	This is Forbes Magazine, on the 14th of February, 2023.
10840	15500	The title of this particular article reads, America's Best Banks.
15500	20580	An entity by the name of Silicon Valley Bank was ranked number 20 and has been on the list
20580	22580	for five years in a row.
22580	31280	In 1983, SVB was the 16th largest bank in the United States and had over $209 billion in assets.
31280	36580	Yet, in a few short weeks, the bank would go up in flames over the course of a couple of days.
36580	44080	Silicon Valley Bank's collapse set off a panic, not seen since the days of the financial meltdown of 2008.
44080	48580	The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is causing shockwaves across the entire business world.
48580	54580	With the FDIC now in control, customers can access up to $250,000 on Monday.
54580	60080	But as ABC's Jacqueline Lee explains, that's not enough for many companies left struggling to manage their finances.
60080	65580	This week, and clients of Silicon Valley Bank are scrambling and imploring the federal government to step in
65580	71080	to help recover uninsured deposits over $250,000.
71080	75080	It's the largest bank failure since the financial crisis of 2008.
75580	83580	The crash created a cascade of events. Some smaller regional banks lost the majority of their valuation and another has since collapsed.
83580	91580	Companies such as Roblox, Vox Media and a whole host of Silicon Valley startups are scrambling to find the cash to pay their employees.
91580	96080	Meanwhile, the UK government is at work trying to minimize the effects of the crash.
96080	102580	And at the same time, the rest of the economy is trying to figure out what the long-term consequences of this disaster may be.
102580	107580	This is the largest bank failure since 2008 and the second largest in history.
107580	113080	But how did a bank go from making the list of the best banks to bankrupt in less than a month?
113080	117080	What happens next? Is this the start of another financial crisis?
117080	120080	Maybe not, but there are some risks.
120080	128080	What everyone seems to have missed in this story is that it's more of a cautionary tale of mismanagement, incompetence and political lobbying.
128080	133080	The bank's parent company, its CEO and CFO are all being sued for fraud.
133080	138580	And the CEO lobbied Congress to remove the very laws that would have prevented this crash in the first place.
138580	141580	This whole thing is a crazy story, so let's get into it.
152580	156580	To understand the consequences of this crash, we need to know how it started.
157080	160080	Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was no ordinary bank.
160080	164080	It was the go-to institution for venture capital and tech startups.
164080	168080	The bank enjoyed a healthy period of growth during the 2020 pandemic.
168080	174080	Low interest rates and excessive money printing from the US Federal Reserve caused the tech sector to boom.
174080	177080	Money was easy and investors were generous.
177080	181080	At the time, startups were able to raise money easily due to cheap credit.
181080	185080	Once the companies got that money, they needed somewhere to store it.
185080	187580	This is where Silicon Valley Bank comes in.
187580	190580	SVB was very popular among founders.
190580	198580	In fact, nearly 50% of all United States startups have some deposits in Silicon Valley Bank.
198580	209580	In 2021, SVB saw a massive influx in deposits, from around $61 billion at the end of 2019 to around $189 billion at the end of 2021.
210080	216080	Now, SVB wanted to make a larger profit from all of this cash that they were suddenly sitting on.
216080	219080	A safe investment would be long-term bonds.
219080	223080	These are usually seen as safer than stocks and provide a steady return.
223080	224080	Here's why.
224080	229080	When interest rates are low, newly issued bonds pay lower interest rates or returns,
229080	233080	making existing long-term bonds that pay higher more attractive.
233580	237580	This leads to an increase in demand for these bonds and an increase in their price,
237580	240580	so whoever's holding these long-term bonds makes money.
240580	248580	SVB saw this situation and invested $80 billion of their tech company deposits in long-term bonds and other securities.
248580	251580	They could then turn around and pay depositors a lower rate.
251580	258580	The difference between the high rates from their long-term bonds and the cost of paying low rates for their deposits would be their profit.
258580	260580	This arrangement works particularly well.
261080	269080	Even if some clients decided to withdraw sooner, the bank can simply sell the bonds and get the liquidity necessary to pay back the depositor.
269080	273080	But what happens when everyone wants to withdraw their money all at once?
273080	276080	Silicon Valley Bank was about to find out.
277080	283080	As we covered in a previous episode about the 2008 crisis and its aftermath that still affects us today,
283080	287080	the post-crisis market isn't used to a high interest rate environment
287080	291580	and higher interest rates could create risks in vulnerable areas of the financial system.
291580	296580	The risk management team of SVB ignored this risk, but more on this later.
298080	301580	Problems for SVB began brewing in late 2021.
301580	304580	In the United States, inflation began to rise.
304580	311580	Usually when this happens, the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates to slow the economy and counteract the inflation.
311580	315580	But this time, the US Federal Reserve stood by and did nothing for a while.
315580	318080	They told everyone that inflation was transitory.
318080	322080	This turned out to be completely wrong, and when the Fed realized their mistake,
322080	326080	they had to raise interest rates very quickly to make up for lost time.
326080	330080	This whiplash in higher rates didn't allow time for the market to adjust.
330080	335080	Meanwhile at SVB, their investing environment began to flip on its head.
335080	339080	As the interest rates rose, the newly issued bonds began to pay higher interest rates
339080	343080	and this made the older long-term bonds less attractive to investors.
343580	347580	This resulted in a decline in demand, causing their prices to fall.
347580	353580	SVB still owned tens of billions worth of these long-term bonds, so they were a sitting duck for risk.
355580	362580	By the end of 2022, there were $15 billion in unrealized losses from the fall in long-term bond prices.
362580	368580	Now, normally this isn't an issue, as if SVB held onto these bonds until maturity,
368580	370080	they wouldn't lose anything.
370080	372580	But this was not a normal time.
372580	377080	In a higher interest rate environment, technology startups were struggling to get financing
377080	379080	as credit began to dry up.
379080	383080	These tech companies needed to dip into their cash to fund their operations.
383080	388080	With startups being the main client for SVB, the deposits started to slow down,
388080	395080	falling from $189 billion at the end of 2021 to $173 billion at the end of 2022.
395080	402080	With every large withdrawal, SVB had to sell some of their long-term bonds to cover the transaction.
402580	406580	For some time, the bank had enough liquidity to deal with these withdrawals.
406580	409580	As time passed, the depositors continued to leave.
409580	414580	On March 8th, 2023, SVB made a bombshell announcement.
414580	419580	They were selling off their entire liquid bond portfolio worth over $21 billion.
419580	423580	Until this point, the falling bond prices were only unrealized losses,
423580	425580	that is, losses only on paper.
425580	430580	But once sold, SVB took a $1.8 billion loss in the sale.
431080	434080	To recoup some losses, management decided to raise some capital.
434080	439080	While this seemed like a logical choice, this was a grave error from management.
439080	441080	The timing could not have been worse.
441080	447080	Just days before, Silvergate, a small crypto-focused bank, failed due to a similar issue.
447080	453080	Although this failure had more to do with the exposure to the overall crypto market, and FTX in particular.
453080	455080	But the root cause was the same.
455080	459080	The bank had a lot of assets which had lost their value due to rising interest rates,
459580	464580	and when withdrawals in the crypto market began to happen, they had no choice but to sell those assets.
464580	468580	Each sale of the assets was at a lower price than when they bought it.
468580	471580	Once the losses piled up, there was no turning back.
471580	475580	Investors assumed that SVB was going down the same path.
475580	483580	Fears over insolvency issues quickly spread, and this resulted in SVB's stock losing close to 60% of its value in one day.
484080	490080	As all of this unfolded, many venture capital firms advised the founders of startups to pull their money out of SVB,
490080	493080	further exacerbating the problem.
493080	498080	By the end of March 9th, customers have withdrawn $42 billion,
498080	503080	leaving the bank with a negative cash balance, about negative $958 million.
503080	509080	The withdrawals were so heavy that it ended up crashing the bank's internal system, only creating more fear.
509080	511080	Depositors had a reason to panic.
511580	516580	In the United States, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC,
516580	520580	the US government only guarantees refunds up to $250,000.
520580	528580	Now the thing is, being a technology company-focused bank, 97% of SVB deposits exceeded this number.
528580	536580	The value of Silicon Valley bank shares continued to be destroyed until its trading was suspended on the morning of March 10th.
537080	541080	They tried to raise capital and failed, and then by midday on March 10th,
541080	546080	the bank started to look for a company to bail them out, and no one wanted to touch them.
546080	549080	Nobody knew the extent of the problem, so it was a risk.
549080	554080	This culminated in SVB being shut down by the FDIC.
554080	559080	This all happened on March 10th, less than two days after the crisis started.
559080	562080	This was a spectacular failure on the side of management.
562080	565080	They failed to adjust to a rising interest rate environment.
565580	571580	And yes, the US Federal Reserve did get it wrong when they stated that inflation was only transitory.
571580	576580	But SVB should have had a contingency plan just in case inflation did stick around.
576580	580580	If any of you watching work in risk management, especially in banking,
580580	584580	I'd love to hear from you in the comments below on what a contingency plan could have been.
584580	587580	It seems that as soon as interest rates started rising,
587580	590580	the bank could have began to offload their long-term treasuries
590580	593580	and exchange them for bonds yielding higher interest to minimize their losses.
594080	599080	Instead, it seems that they waited and sold all of their liquid long-term bonds at once,
599080	601080	after the value had already fallen.
601080	603080	As Bill Ackman states,
603080	607080	quote, Silicon Valley Bank senior management made a basic mistake
607080	611080	they invested short-term deposits in longer-term fixed-rate assets.
611080	613080	So how could management do such a thing?
613080	617080	Well, the story gets a bit wilder the more that you look.
617580	621580	As people began to dig deeper into this crash,
621580	624580	some new information painted a very worrisome picture.
624580	627580	The chief risk officer for Silicon Valley Bank
627580	630580	hightailed and left in April of 2022
630580	633580	and wasn't replaced until January of 2023.
633580	638580	This meant that the bank had no chief risk officer for eight months.
638580	641580	This was precisely at the time when the downward feedback loop
641580	644580	was accelerating from the higher interest rates.
645080	648080	Just when the bank's portfolios needed to be re-balanced
648080	650080	to account for higher interest rates,
650080	652080	there was no one to oversee the process.
652080	656080	In other words, the bank was a plane without a pilot during a storm.
656080	658080	Just shocking.
658080	659580	But it doesn't end there.
659580	662080	Worse yet, Silicon Valley Bank's CAO
662080	665080	was the CFO of none other than Lehman Brothers
665080	667080	at the time of its crash.
667080	670080	And he can't help but laugh at how ridiculous this next part is.
670080	672080	The Federal Reserve Bank,
672580	675580	The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco
675580	677580	was in charge of supervising SVB
677580	679580	and guess who was on the board?
679580	681580	The CEO of SVB,
681580	683580	Greg Becker.
683580	686580	Greg was promptly yeeted from the board after the crash.
686580	690580	Interestingly, the CEO, CFO and CMO of the bank
690580	694580	sold a combined $4.4 million of company stock
694580	696580	just weeks before SVB's decline.
696580	700580	An SEC filing stated that the sale of the shares
701080	704080	was, quote, automated and, quote, pre-planned.
704080	708080	But it remains unclear if there was some foreknowledge of the collapse.
708080	710080	Further to this, the bank's employees
710080	714080	sieve their annual bonuses ranging from 12,000 to 140,000
714080	717080	only hours before the bank's official crash.
717080	719080	I can't allege implications of wrongdoing,
719080	721080	but there may be a chance that the guys at the top
721080	723080	knew something was coming.
723080	727080	Right now, SVB is being sued for fraud by shareholders.
727080	729080	The lawsuit states that the company
729080	731580	failed to disclose how rising interest rates
731580	734580	could leave the bank particularly susceptible to a bank run.
737580	739580	A crash of SVB was indeed unique.
739580	743580	A combination of rapid growth, bad risk management,
743580	747580	low interest rates, excessive exposure to only one market
747580	750580	and large deposits with no FDIC insurance
750580	752580	have all led us to this point.
752580	756580	But is this the start of something bigger for the financial system?
756580	758580	Is it a Lehman moment?
759080	762080	It may very well have been a Lehman moment for regional banks
762080	765080	as they have similar characteristics to SVB.
765080	766580	Their clients are businesses.
766580	769080	They operate in a very limited number of fields
769080	772080	and they all have some exposure to unrealized losses
772080	774080	in this higher interest rate environment.
775080	778080	Because of this, the stocks of First Bank Republic,
778080	781080	Western Alliance Bank Corp and Westpac Bank Corp
781080	784080	and other regional banks have all seen large declines.
784080	786580	Some as much as 66% in a day.
786580	789580	Many hedge funds have also started to short sell.
816580	821580	The falls and the stock prices were so drastic
821580	824580	that the trading of a slew of these banks had to be halted.
824580	826580	Okay, so this next part is key.
826580	829580	Right at this moment, the rest of the banking system
829580	831580	seems to be largely unaffected,
831580	833580	as one analyst at Barclays wrote,
833580	835580	quote, deposit pressure.
835580	837580	This means that the banks will not be able to sell
837580	839580	their shares at the same time.
839580	842580	This means that the banks will not be able to sell their shares
842580	844580	at the same time.
844580	847580	Quote, deposit pressure is the greatest for smaller banks,
847580	849580	including regionals.
849580	852580	Global banks have more diverse funding sources
852580	855580	and therefore are less vulnerable to that risk.
855580	858580	That being said, Bank of America does have large exposure
858580	861580	to long-term bonds that are planned to be held to maturity.
861580	863580	Though if they don't sell and actually hold these bonds
863580	866580	to maturity, this shouldn't be a problem.
867580	869580	Many are comparing this situation
869580	872580	to that of the 2008 financial crisis.
872580	874580	Yet this is quite different.
874580	876580	During that time, some of the largest banks in the US
876580	878580	all failed simultaneously
878580	880580	and they had much bigger issues to deal with.
880580	883580	These banks had sizable investments in assets
883580	885580	that overnight became worthless.
885580	888580	The assets that are responsible for the crash of SVB
888580	891580	are not worthless, in fact, far from it.
891580	893580	They're backed by the US government
893580	895580	and if held to maturity, in theory,
895580	897580	they're not going to lose any value.
897580	901580	The problem for SVB is that they sold all of these bonds early
901580	903580	and realized those losses, tried to raise funds
903580	906580	to cover those losses and that triggered a panic.
906580	908580	Another difference resides in the fact
908580	911580	that the banks in 2008 had huge leverage issues.
911580	913580	In the case of Lehman Brothers, for example,
913580	917580	the leverage exceeded 30 times the underlying assets.
917580	921580	In other words, a decline of 3-5% in those assets
921580	924580	meant that Lehman Brothers was completely bankrupt.
924580	927580	And lastly, the big banks have a far greater degree
927580	929580	of diversification than regional banks.
929580	933580	This means that they can withstand liquidity shocks more easily,
933580	937580	as generally, not every single sector gets impacted at the same time.
937580	941580	Not only this, but the bigger banks will probably benefit
941580	943580	from the collapse of regional banks.
943580	945580	Depositors may move their money from regional banks
945580	947580	to larger institutions.
947580	949580	And if there are more bank failures,
949580	951580	the larger banks can simply gobble up the healthy parts
951580	953580	for pennies on the dollar.
953580	955580	Does this mean that the risk of a financial crisis
955580	957580	is non-existent?
957580	959580	Really, while the current financial system
959580	962580	is very different from the one in 2008,
962580	964580	there is still a chance that this may be the first crack
964580	967580	in the fabrics of the current financial system.
967580	969580	As of December 2022,
969580	972580	the total unrealized losses for the whole banking system
972580	974580	was close to $620 billion.
974580	976580	If panic spreads too much,
976580	978580	many small banks will go down as a result,
978580	980580	creating a cascading effect
980580	982580	that would cause the rest of the economy to wobble.
982580	985580	The Federal Reserve and the financial sectors of the US government
985580	988580	have recognized this and have come up with a solution,
988580	990580	which we'll get to shortly.
992580	994580	The industry that will feel the most pain
994580	996580	is going to be the tech sector.
996580	999580	SVB, quote, was the lifeblood of the tech ecosystem,
999580	1001580	states Ro Khanna,
1001580	1004580	a congressman from California's 17th district.
1004580	1006580	Tens of thousands of startups
1006580	1008580	rely on them to pay their day-to-day operations,
1008580	1010580	including staff.
1010580	1012580	You see, unlike traditional businesses,
1012580	1015580	many of these tech companies have negative cash flows.
1015580	1017580	The only way that they can pay their expenses
1017580	1019580	is by raising capital.
1019580	1021580	After the capital has been obtained,
1021580	1024580	they store it and use it until the next raise.
1024580	1026580	If you take that stored money away,
1026580	1029580	very quickly, many of these firms start to fail.
1029580	1032580	Several firms aren't going to be able to pay their employees,
1032580	1035580	and if there's further delays in when the money is returned,
1035580	1039580	a huge wave of layoffs and then eventually bankruptcies will follow.
1039580	1041580	Etsy had to delay their seller payouts.
1041580	1043580	The streaming company, Roku,
1043580	1045580	held a quarter of its cash reserves in SVB.
1045580	1049580	Roblox, Rocket Lab, Circle, Vox Media, and Vimeo
1049580	1051580	are among countless companies affected.
1051580	1055580	The CEO of Y Combinator, Gary Tan, puts it best,
1055580	1058580	quote, this is an extinction-level event for startups
1058580	1062580	and will set back their innovation by 10 years or more.
1062580	1065580	Confidence in the finance industry has been shaken.
1065580	1068580	US banks lost a combined 100 billion
1068580	1071580	and 50 billion for the valuation of European banks.
1071580	1073580	On the 13th of March,
1073580	1076580	Joe Biden had to reassure the United States population.
1076580	1078580	Look, the bottom line is this.
1078580	1083580	Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe.
1083580	1085580	Your deposits are safe.
1085580	1088580	Let me also assure you we will not stop at this.
1088580	1090580	We'll do whatever is needed.
1090580	1092580	The situation also spreads to the UK.
1092580	1096580	The Bank of England was looking for ways to minimize the damage.
1096580	1099580	The United Kingdom also had an arm of Silicon Valley Bank.
1099580	1101580	Then, on March 13th,
1101580	1105580	HSBC bought the stricken UK entity from measly one pound
1105580	1108580	or one US dollar and 21 cents.
1108580	1110580	At the height of the chaos,
1110580	1114580	200 UK firms confirmed that they weren't going to be able to pay their staff.
1114580	1116580	On the other side of the world,
1116580	1119580	Chinese startups also reported issues accessing their funds.
1119580	1123580	SVB was especially popular among Chinese biotech startups.
1123580	1125580	As one founder explained,
1125580	1126580	quote,
1126580	1128580	We tried everything Friday morning,
1128580	1129580	but it was already too late.
1129580	1131580	The transfer is still processing.
1131580	1132580	It's very crazy.
1132580	1134580	We didn't think this could happen.
1134580	1135580	For Chinese groups,
1135580	1139580	their ecosystem was already damaged by Beijing's tech crackdown
1139580	1141580	and COVID-19 pandemic controls,
1141580	1145580	not to mention the rising geopolitical tensions with Washington.
1147580	1149580	So in all of this,
1149580	1151580	where were the regulators?
1151580	1153580	Well, being lobbied apparently.
1153580	1155580	Back in 2015,
1155580	1160580	SVB CEO begged lawmakers to exempt banks with assets less than 250 billion
1160580	1164580	from the tough supervision and regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act.
1164580	1166580	For those who remember my 2008 episode,
1166580	1171580	this act was put into place to stop another financial crisis.
1171580	1175580	In 2018, a bill was passed that weakened this act
1175580	1177580	and Greg Becker got his wish.
1177580	1181580	Sol Omarova, professor of law at Cornell University,
1181580	1185580	who testified before the Senate against relaxing regulations for smaller banks,
1185580	1187580	said that the 2018 bill, quote,
1187580	1189580	should not have passed.
1189580	1191580	And he was spot on.
1193580	1195580	The dust has only just started to settle.
1195580	1198580	Silicon Valley Bank is now under FDIC control
1198580	1201580	and the FDIC has since moved SVB deposits
1201580	1203580	to a newly formed holding bank
1203580	1206580	and named Tim Mayopolis as CEO.
1207580	1209580	On March 12, 2023,
1209580	1211580	another regional bank signature bank collapsed.
1211580	1215580	Meanwhile, signature bank marks the third largest bank failure in US history.
1215580	1218580	Seeing more possible bank failures on the horizon,
1218580	1221580	the Federal Reserve had to do something unprecedented.
1221580	1224580	They announced the creation of a bank term funding program
1224580	1227580	to shore up liquidity for other at-risk banks.
1227580	1231580	They're allowing the affected banks to sell their long-term bonds and securities
1231580	1233580	to the Fed without a loss.
1233580	1235580	In another announcement on the same day,
1235580	1239580	the Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC stated
1239580	1242580	that all depositors, even the uninsured ones,
1242580	1245580	will be made whole without the expenditure of taxpayer money.
1245580	1250580	Some financial commentators have said that this is an inflationary move.
1250580	1254580	A lot of regional banks who use the same style of banking as SVB
1254580	1258580	saw worried depositors piling up outside to get their money out.
1258580	1261580	The Fed and US government had to do these drastic moves
1261580	1264580	to avoid bank runs and a cascade of bankruptcies.
1265580	1268580	Nobody is a fan of government-assisted bailouts,
1268580	1270580	but this is a tough situation.
1270580	1273580	As Simon Johnson, an economist at MIT,
1273580	1277580	who previously served as the chief economist of the IMF, says,
1277580	1278580	quote,
1278580	1280580	All choices are bad choices.
1280580	1282580	You don't want to extend this kind of bailout to people,
1282580	1284580	but if you aren't doing that,
1284580	1288580	you face a run of really big and really hard-to-predict proportions.
1289580	1293580	This is the largest banking failure since the financial crisis.
1293580	1296580	If the Fed's creation of the bank term funding program
1296580	1298580	isn't as smooth as promised or takes too long,
1298580	1302580	the consequences for the companies around the US could be devastating.
1302580	1305580	Even though I think the Federal Reserve does have some blame
1305580	1307580	for the background macroeconomic situation,
1307580	1309580	they did need to do something.
1309580	1312580	Further to this, if the Federal Reserve reverses course
1312580	1314580	and starts cutting interest rates,
1314580	1316580	inflation could ramp up again.
1316580	1318580	Causing even more havoc,
1318580	1321580	they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
1321580	1323580	Raise rates, destroy the economy.
1323580	1326580	Cut rates, also destroy the economy.
1326580	1331580	With Silicon Valley holding 50% of US VC-backed startups as customers,
1331580	1335580	65,000 startups would be affected by the collapse.
1335580	1339580	Even if the government does succeed in making each depositor whole,
1339580	1341580	it's a sad time for the tech sector,
1341580	1343580	as confidence has been shaken.
1343580	1347580	The nightmare of being locked out of company cash, delays in paying staff,
1347580	1351580	and countless administration issues will leave a scar.
1351580	1356580	In summary, this is a story of rapidly changing market conditions,
1356580	1359580	risk management failure, and lobbying.
1359580	1361580	But zooming out even further,
1361580	1365580	this is exactly the kind of risk I was talking about in my 2008 episode.
1365580	1367580	In the third section of that video,
1367580	1371580	I talked about how unhealthy this economy has been ever since the crash,
1371580	1376580	the post-crisis economy has been built on a scaffolding of easy money and low interest rates.
1376580	1378580	When these conditions reverse,
1378580	1381580	we'll start to see that weak scaffolding start to shake.
1381580	1384580	What happened here is proof right in our faces.
1384580	1389580	It will be the weaker and badly managed sectors of the economy that start to show it first.
1389580	1392580	But what happens after that is anyone's guess.
1392580	1394580	You should definitely watch that episode if you haven't already.
1394580	1396580	I think you'll get a lot out of it.
1396580	1398580	So this SVB story is still unfolding.
1398580	1402580	We can only wait and see what the longer term impacts will be.
1402580	1404580	So that's about it from me.
1404580	1405580	Thanks for watching.
