00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,220
Hi, welcome to another episode of Cold Fusion.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,840
This is Forbes Magazine, on the 14th of February, 2023.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:15,500
The title of this particular article reads, America's Best Banks.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,580
An entity by the name of Silicon Valley Bank was ranked number 20 and has been on the list

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,580
for five years in a row.

6
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:31,280
In 1983, SVB was the 16th largest bank in the United States and had over $209 billion in assets.

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,580
Yet, in a few short weeks, the bank would go up in flames over the course of a couple of days.

8
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:44,080
Silicon Valley Bank's collapse set off a panic, not seen since the days of the financial meltdown of 2008.

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:48,580
The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is causing shockwaves across the entire business world.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,580
With the FDIC now in control, customers can access up to $250,000 on Monday.

11
00:00:54,580 --> 00:01:00,080
But as ABC's Jacqueline Lee explains, that's not enough for many companies left struggling to manage their finances.

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,580
This week, and clients of Silicon Valley Bank are scrambling and imploring the federal government to step in

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,080
to help recover uninsured deposits over $250,000.

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,080
It's the largest bank failure since the financial crisis of 2008.

15
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:23,580
The crash created a cascade of events. Some smaller regional banks lost the majority of their valuation and another has since collapsed.

16
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:31,580
Companies such as Roblox, Vox Media and a whole host of Silicon Valley startups are scrambling to find the cash to pay their employees.

17
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,080
Meanwhile, the UK government is at work trying to minimize the effects of the crash.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:42,580
And at the same time, the rest of the economy is trying to figure out what the long-term consequences of this disaster may be.

19
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,580
This is the largest bank failure since 2008 and the second largest in history.

20
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,080
But how did a bank go from making the list of the best banks to bankrupt in less than a month?

21
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,080
What happens next? Is this the start of another financial crisis?

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Maybe not, but there are some risks.

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:08,080
What everyone seems to have missed in this story is that it's more of a cautionary tale of mismanagement, incompetence and political lobbying.

24
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,080
The bank's parent company, its CEO and CFO are all being sued for fraud.

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,580
And the CEO lobbied Congress to remove the very laws that would have prevented this crash in the first place.

26
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,580
This whole thing is a crazy story, so let's get into it.

27
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,580
To understand the consequences of this crash, we need to know how it started.

28
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Silicon Valley Bank, or SVB, was no ordinary bank.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
It was the go-to institution for venture capital and tech startups.

30
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
The bank enjoyed a healthy period of growth during the 2020 pandemic.

31
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,080
Low interest rates and excessive money printing from the US Federal Reserve caused the tech sector to boom.

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,080
Money was easy and investors were generous.

33
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,080
At the time, startups were able to raise money easily due to cheap credit.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Once the companies got that money, they needed somewhere to store it.

35
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,580
This is where Silicon Valley Bank comes in.

36
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,580
SVB was very popular among founders.

37
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:18,580
In fact, nearly 50% of all United States startups have some deposits in Silicon Valley Bank.

38
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:29,580
In 2021, SVB saw a massive influx in deposits, from around $61 billion at the end of 2019 to around $189 billion at the end of 2021.

39
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Now, SVB wanted to make a larger profit from all of this cash that they were suddenly sitting on.

40
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,080
A safe investment would be long-term bonds.

41
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,080
These are usually seen as safer than stocks and provide a steady return.

42
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Here's why.

43
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,080
When interest rates are low, newly issued bonds pay lower interest rates or returns,

44
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,080
making existing long-term bonds that pay higher more attractive.

45
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,580
This leads to an increase in demand for these bonds and an increase in their price,

46
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,580
so whoever's holding these long-term bonds makes money.

47
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:08,580
SVB saw this situation and invested $80 billion of their tech company deposits in long-term bonds and other securities.

48
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,580
They could then turn around and pay depositors a lower rate.

49
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:18,580
The difference between the high rates from their long-term bonds and the cost of paying low rates for their deposits would be their profit.

50
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,580
This arrangement works particularly well.

51
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Even if some clients decided to withdraw sooner, the bank can simply sell the bonds and get the liquidity necessary to pay back the depositor.

52
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,080
But what happens when everyone wants to withdraw their money all at once?

53
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,080
Silicon Valley Bank was about to find out.

54
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,080
As we covered in a previous episode about the 2008 crisis and its aftermath that still affects us today,

55
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,080
the post-crisis market isn't used to a high interest rate environment

56
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,580
and higher interest rates could create risks in vulnerable areas of the financial system.

57
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,580
The risk management team of SVB ignored this risk, but more on this later.

58
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,580
Problems for SVB began brewing in late 2021.

59
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,580
In the United States, inflation began to rise.

60
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:11,580
Usually when this happens, the US Federal Reserve would increase interest rates to slow the economy and counteract the inflation.

61
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,580
But this time, the US Federal Reserve stood by and did nothing for a while.

62
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,080
They told everyone that inflation was transitory.

63
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,080
This turned out to be completely wrong, and when the Fed realized their mistake,

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,080
they had to raise interest rates very quickly to make up for lost time.

65
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,080
This whiplash in higher rates didn't allow time for the market to adjust.

66
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Meanwhile at SVB, their investing environment began to flip on its head.

67
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,080
As the interest rates rose, the newly issued bonds began to pay higher interest rates

68
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,080
and this made the older long-term bonds less attractive to investors.

69
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,580
This resulted in a decline in demand, causing their prices to fall.

70
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,580
SVB still owned tens of billions worth of these long-term bonds, so they were a sitting duck for risk.

71
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,580
By the end of 2022, there were $15 billion in unrealized losses from the fall in long-term bond prices.

72
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:08,580
Now, normally this isn't an issue, as if SVB held onto these bonds until maturity,

73
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,080
they wouldn't lose anything.

74
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,580
But this was not a normal time.

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:17,080
In a higher interest rate environment, technology startups were struggling to get financing

76
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
as credit began to dry up.

77
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,080
These tech companies needed to dip into their cash to fund their operations.

78
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,080
With startups being the main client for SVB, the deposits started to slow down,

79
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:35,080
falling from $189 billion at the end of 2021 to $173 billion at the end of 2022.

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:42,080
With every large withdrawal, SVB had to sell some of their long-term bonds to cover the transaction.

81
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,580
For some time, the bank had enough liquidity to deal with these withdrawals.

82
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,580
As time passed, the depositors continued to leave.

83
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,580
On March 8th, 2023, SVB made a bombshell announcement.

84
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,580
They were selling off their entire liquid bond portfolio worth over $21 billion.

85
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:03,580
Until this point, the falling bond prices were only unrealized losses,

86
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,580
that is, losses only on paper.

87
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:10,580
But once sold, SVB took a $1.8 billion loss in the sale.

88
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,080
To recoup some losses, management decided to raise some capital.

89
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,080
While this seemed like a logical choice, this was a grave error from management.

90
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,080
The timing could not have been worse.

91
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,080
Just days before, Silvergate, a small crypto-focused bank, failed due to a similar issue.

92
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Although this failure had more to do with the exposure to the overall crypto market, and FTX in particular.

93
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
But the root cause was the same.

94
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,080
The bank had a lot of assets which had lost their value due to rising interest rates,

95
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,580
and when withdrawals in the crypto market began to happen, they had no choice but to sell those assets.

96
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,580
Each sale of the assets was at a lower price than when they bought it.

97
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Once the losses piled up, there was no turning back.

98
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,580
Investors assumed that SVB was going down the same path.

99
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:03,580
Fears over insolvency issues quickly spread, and this resulted in SVB's stock losing close to 60% of its value in one day.

100
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,080
As all of this unfolded, many venture capital firms advised the founders of startups to pull their money out of SVB,

101
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
further exacerbating the problem.

102
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,080
By the end of March 9th, customers have withdrawn $42 billion,

103
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,080
leaving the bank with a negative cash balance, about negative $958 million.

104
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:29,080
The withdrawals were so heavy that it ended up crashing the bank's internal system, only creating more fear.

105
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,080
Depositors had a reason to panic.

106
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,580
In the United States, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC,

107
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,580
the US government only guarantees refunds up to $250,000.

108
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Now the thing is, being a technology company-focused bank, 97% of SVB deposits exceeded this number.

109
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:56,580
The value of Silicon Valley bank shares continued to be destroyed until its trading was suspended on the morning of March 10th.

110
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,080
They tried to raise capital and failed, and then by midday on March 10th,

111
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,080
the bank started to look for a company to bail them out, and no one wanted to touch them.

112
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,080
Nobody knew the extent of the problem, so it was a risk.

113
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:14,080
This culminated in SVB being shut down by the FDIC.

114
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,080
This all happened on March 10th, less than two days after the crisis started.

115
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,080
This was a spectacular failure on the side of management.

116
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,080
They failed to adjust to a rising interest rate environment.

117
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:31,580
And yes, the US Federal Reserve did get it wrong when they stated that inflation was only transitory.

118
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,580
But SVB should have had a contingency plan just in case inflation did stick around.

119
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,580
If any of you watching work in risk management, especially in banking,

120
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,580
I'd love to hear from you in the comments below on what a contingency plan could have been.

121
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,580
It seems that as soon as interest rates started rising,

122
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,580
the bank could have began to offload their long-term treasuries

123
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,580
and exchange them for bonds yielding higher interest to minimize their losses.

124
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,080
Instead, it seems that they waited and sold all of their liquid long-term bonds at once,

125
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,080
after the value had already fallen.

126
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
As Bill Ackman states,

127
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,080
quote, Silicon Valley Bank senior management made a basic mistake

128
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:11,080
they invested short-term deposits in longer-term fixed-rate assets.

129
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
So how could management do such a thing?

130
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,080
Well, the story gets a bit wilder the more that you look.

131
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:21,580
As people began to dig deeper into this crash,

132
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,580
some new information painted a very worrisome picture.

133
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,580
The chief risk officer for Silicon Valley Bank

134
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,580
hightailed and left in April of 2022

135
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,580
and wasn't replaced until January of 2023.

136
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,580
This meant that the bank had no chief risk officer for eight months.

137
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,580
This was precisely at the time when the downward feedback loop

138
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,580
was accelerating from the higher interest rates.

139
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Just when the bank's portfolios needed to be re-balanced

140
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
to account for higher interest rates,

141
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,080
there was no one to oversee the process.

142
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,080
In other words, the bank was a plane without a pilot during a storm.

143
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Just shocking.

144
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,580
But it doesn't end there.

145
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:02,080
Worse yet, Silicon Valley Bank's CAO

146
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,080
was the CFO of none other than Lehman Brothers

147
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
at the time of its crash.

148
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,080
And he can't help but laugh at how ridiculous this next part is.

149
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
The Federal Reserve Bank,

150
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,580
The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco

151
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,580
was in charge of supervising SVB

152
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,580
and guess who was on the board?

153
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,580
The CEO of SVB,

154
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,580
Greg Becker.

155
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:26,580
Greg was promptly yeeted from the board after the crash.

156
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:30,580
Interestingly, the CEO, CFO and CMO of the bank

157
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,580
sold a combined $4.4 million of company stock

158
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:36,580
just weeks before SVB's decline.

159
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:40,580
An SEC filing stated that the sale of the shares

160
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,080
was, quote, automated and, quote, pre-planned.

161
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:48,080
But it remains unclear if there was some foreknowledge of the collapse.

162
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,080
Further to this, the bank's employees

163
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,080
sieve their annual bonuses ranging from 12,000 to 140,000

164
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,080
only hours before the bank's official crash.

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,080
I can't allege implications of wrongdoing,

166
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
but there may be a chance that the guys at the top

167
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
knew something was coming.

168
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Right now, SVB is being sued for fraud by shareholders.

169
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
The lawsuit states that the company

170
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,580
failed to disclose how rising interest rates

171
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,580
could leave the bank particularly susceptible to a bank run.

172
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,580
A crash of SVB was indeed unique.

173
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,580
A combination of rapid growth, bad risk management,

174
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,580
low interest rates, excessive exposure to only one market

175
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,580
and large deposits with no FDIC insurance

176
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
have all led us to this point.

177
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,580
But is this the start of something bigger for the financial system?

178
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Is it a Lehman moment?

179
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,080
It may very well have been a Lehman moment for regional banks

180
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,080
as they have similar characteristics to SVB.

181
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,580
Their clients are businesses.

182
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,080
They operate in a very limited number of fields

183
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,080
and they all have some exposure to unrealized losses

184
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
in this higher interest rate environment.

185
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Because of this, the stocks of First Bank Republic,

186
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Western Alliance Bank Corp and Westpac Bank Corp

187
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,080
and other regional banks have all seen large declines.

188
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,580
Some as much as 66% in a day.

189
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,580
Many hedge funds have also started to short sell.

190
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,580
The falls and the stock prices were so drastic

191
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,580
that the trading of a slew of these banks had to be halted.

192
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
Okay, so this next part is key.

193
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,580
Right at this moment, the rest of the banking system

194
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,580
seems to be largely unaffected,

195
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
as one analyst at Barclays wrote,

196
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,580
quote, deposit pressure.

197
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,580
This means that the banks will not be able to sell

198
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,580
their shares at the same time.

199
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,580
This means that the banks will not be able to sell their shares

200
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,580
at the same time.

201
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,580
Quote, deposit pressure is the greatest for smaller banks,

202
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
including regionals.

203
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,580
Global banks have more diverse funding sources

204
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,580
and therefore are less vulnerable to that risk.

205
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,580
That being said, Bank of America does have large exposure

206
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,580
to long-term bonds that are planned to be held to maturity.

207
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,580
Though if they don't sell and actually hold these bonds

208
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,580
to maturity, this shouldn't be a problem.

209
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,580
Many are comparing this situation

210
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,580
to that of the 2008 financial crisis.

211
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,580
Yet this is quite different.

212
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,580
During that time, some of the largest banks in the US

213
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,580
all failed simultaneously

214
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,580
and they had much bigger issues to deal with.

215
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,580
These banks had sizable investments in assets

216
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,580
that overnight became worthless.

217
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,580
The assets that are responsible for the crash of SVB

218
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:51,580
are not worthless, in fact, far from it.

219
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,580
They're backed by the US government

220
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
and if held to maturity, in theory,

221
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,580
they're not going to lose any value.

222
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:01,580
The problem for SVB is that they sold all of these bonds early

223
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,580
and realized those losses, tried to raise funds

224
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,580
to cover those losses and that triggered a panic.

225
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
Another difference resides in the fact

226
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,580
that the banks in 2008 had huge leverage issues.

227
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,580
In the case of Lehman Brothers, for example,

228
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,580
the leverage exceeded 30 times the underlying assets.

229
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,580
In other words, a decline of 3-5% in those assets

230
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,580
meant that Lehman Brothers was completely bankrupt.

231
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,580
And lastly, the big banks have a far greater degree

232
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,580
of diversification than regional banks.

233
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:33,580
This means that they can withstand liquidity shocks more easily,

234
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,580
as generally, not every single sector gets impacted at the same time.

235
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,580
Not only this, but the bigger banks will probably benefit

236
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
from the collapse of regional banks.

237
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,580
Depositors may move their money from regional banks

238
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,580
to larger institutions.

239
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,580
And if there are more bank failures,

240
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,580
the larger banks can simply gobble up the healthy parts

241
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,580
for pennies on the dollar.

242
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Does this mean that the risk of a financial crisis

243
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,580
is non-existent?

244
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,580
Really, while the current financial system

245
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:02,580
is very different from the one in 2008,

246
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,580
there is still a chance that this may be the first crack

247
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,580
in the fabrics of the current financial system.

248
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,580
As of December 2022,

249
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,580
the total unrealized losses for the whole banking system

250
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,580
was close to $620 billion.

251
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,580
If panic spreads too much,

252
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,580
many small banks will go down as a result,

253
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,580
creating a cascading effect

254
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
that would cause the rest of the economy to wobble.

255
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,580
The Federal Reserve and the financial sectors of the US government

256
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,580
have recognized this and have come up with a solution,

257
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,580
which we'll get to shortly.

258
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,580
The industry that will feel the most pain

259
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,580
is going to be the tech sector.

260
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,580
SVB, quote, was the lifeblood of the tech ecosystem,

261
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,580
states Ro Khanna,

262
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,580
a congressman from California's 17th district.

263
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,580
Tens of thousands of startups

264
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,580
rely on them to pay their day-to-day operations,

265
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,580
including staff.

266
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,580
You see, unlike traditional businesses,

267
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,580
many of these tech companies have negative cash flows.

268
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,580
The only way that they can pay their expenses

269
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,580
is by raising capital.

270
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,580
After the capital has been obtained,

271
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,580
they store it and use it until the next raise.

272
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,580
If you take that stored money away,

273
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,580
very quickly, many of these firms start to fail.

274
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:12,580
Several firms aren't going to be able to pay their employees,

275
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,580
and if there's further delays in when the money is returned,

276
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,580
a huge wave of layoffs and then eventually bankruptcies will follow.

277
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,580
Etsy had to delay their seller payouts.

278
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,580
The streaming company, Roku,

279
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,580
held a quarter of its cash reserves in SVB.

280
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,580
Roblox, Rocket Lab, Circle, Vox Media, and Vimeo

281
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,580
are among countless companies affected.

282
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,580
The CEO of Y Combinator, Gary Tan, puts it best,

283
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,580
quote, this is an extinction-level event for startups

284
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,580
and will set back their innovation by 10 years or more.

285
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,580
Confidence in the finance industry has been shaken.

286
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,580
US banks lost a combined 100 billion

287
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,580
and 50 billion for the valuation of European banks.

288
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
On the 13th of March,

289
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:56,580
Joe Biden had to reassure the United States population.

290
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,580
Look, the bottom line is this.

291
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Americans can rest assured that our banking system is safe.

292
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,580
Your deposits are safe.

293
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,580
Let me also assure you we will not stop at this.

294
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,580
We'll do whatever is needed.

295
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,580
The situation also spreads to the UK.

296
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,580
The Bank of England was looking for ways to minimize the damage.

297
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:19,580
The United Kingdom also had an arm of Silicon Valley Bank.

298
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
Then, on March 13th,

299
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:25,580
HSBC bought the stricken UK entity from measly one pound

300
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,580
or one US dollar and 21 cents.

301
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,580
At the height of the chaos,

302
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,580
200 UK firms confirmed that they weren't going to be able to pay their staff.

303
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,580
On the other side of the world,

304
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,580
Chinese startups also reported issues accessing their funds.

305
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,580
SVB was especially popular among Chinese biotech startups.

306
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,580
As one founder explained,

307
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,580
quote,

308
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
We tried everything Friday morning,

309
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,580
but it was already too late.

310
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,580
The transfer is still processing.

311
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
It's very crazy.

312
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,580
We didn't think this could happen.

313
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,580
For Chinese groups,

314
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:59,580
their ecosystem was already damaged by Beijing's tech crackdown

315
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,580
and COVID-19 pandemic controls,

316
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,580
not to mention the rising geopolitical tensions with Washington.

317
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,580
So in all of this,

318
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
where were the regulators?

319
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,580
Well, being lobbied apparently.

320
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,580
Back in 2015,

321
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,580
SVB CEO begged lawmakers to exempt banks with assets less than 250 billion

322
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,580
from the tough supervision and regulations of the Dodd-Frank Act.

323
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,580
For those who remember my 2008 episode,

324
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,580
this act was put into place to stop another financial crisis.

325
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,580
In 2018, a bill was passed that weakened this act

326
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,580
and Greg Becker got his wish.

327
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:41,580
Sol Omarova, professor of law at Cornell University,

328
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,580
who testified before the Senate against relaxing regulations for smaller banks,

329
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,580
said that the 2018 bill, quote,

330
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,580
should not have passed.

331
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,580
And he was spot on.

332
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,580
The dust has only just started to settle.

333
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,580
Silicon Valley Bank is now under FDIC control

334
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,580
and the FDIC has since moved SVB deposits

335
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,580
to a newly formed holding bank

336
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:06,580
and named Tim Mayopolis as CEO.

337
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,580
On March 12, 2023,

338
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,580
another regional bank signature bank collapsed.

339
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:15,580
Meanwhile, signature bank marks the third largest bank failure in US history.

340
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,580
Seeing more possible bank failures on the horizon,

341
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,580
the Federal Reserve had to do something unprecedented.

342
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,580
They announced the creation of a bank term funding program

343
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:27,580
to shore up liquidity for other at-risk banks.

344
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,580
They're allowing the affected banks to sell their long-term bonds and securities

345
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,580
to the Fed without a loss.

346
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,580
In another announcement on the same day,

347
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,580
the Treasury, Federal Reserve and FDIC stated

348
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,580
that all depositors, even the uninsured ones,

349
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,580
will be made whole without the expenditure of taxpayer money.

350
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,580
Some financial commentators have said that this is an inflationary move.

351
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,580
A lot of regional banks who use the same style of banking as SVB

352
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:58,580
saw worried depositors piling up outside to get their money out.

353
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,580
The Fed and US government had to do these drastic moves

354
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,580
to avoid bank runs and a cascade of bankruptcies.

355
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,580
Nobody is a fan of government-assisted bailouts,

356
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,580
but this is a tough situation.

357
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,580
As Simon Johnson, an economist at MIT,

358
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,580
who previously served as the chief economist of the IMF, says,

359
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,580
quote,

360
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,580
All choices are bad choices.

361
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
You don't want to extend this kind of bailout to people,

362
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,580
but if you aren't doing that,

363
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:28,580
you face a run of really big and really hard-to-predict proportions.

364
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,580
This is the largest banking failure since the financial crisis.

365
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,580
If the Fed's creation of the bank term funding program

366
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
isn't as smooth as promised or takes too long,

367
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,580
the consequences for the companies around the US could be devastating.

368
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,580
Even though I think the Federal Reserve does have some blame

369
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
for the background macroeconomic situation,

370
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
they did need to do something.

371
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,580
Further to this, if the Federal Reserve reverses course

372
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,580
and starts cutting interest rates,

373
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
inflation could ramp up again.

374
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
Causing even more havoc,

375
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,580
they're stuck between a rock and a hard place.

376
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Raise rates, destroy the economy.

377
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,580
Cut rates, also destroy the economy.

378
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,580
With Silicon Valley holding 50% of US VC-backed startups as customers,

379
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,580
65,000 startups would be affected by the collapse.

380
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,580
Even if the government does succeed in making each depositor whole,

381
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,580
it's a sad time for the tech sector,

382
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
as confidence has been shaken.

383
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,580
The nightmare of being locked out of company cash, delays in paying staff,

384
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:31,580
and countless administration issues will leave a scar.

385
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,580
In summary, this is a story of rapidly changing market conditions,

386
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:39,580
risk management failure, and lobbying.

387
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,580
But zooming out even further,

388
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,580
this is exactly the kind of risk I was talking about in my 2008 episode.

389
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
In the third section of that video,

390
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,580
I talked about how unhealthy this economy has been ever since the crash,

391
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:56,580
the post-crisis economy has been built on a scaffolding of easy money and low interest rates.

392
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,580
When these conditions reverse,

393
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,580
we'll start to see that weak scaffolding start to shake.

394
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,580
What happened here is proof right in our faces.

395
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:09,580
It will be the weaker and badly managed sectors of the economy that start to show it first.

396
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:12,580
But what happens after that is anyone's guess.

397
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,580
You should definitely watch that episode if you haven't already.

398
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,580
I think you'll get a lot out of it.

399
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,580
So this SVB story is still unfolding.

400
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:22,580
We can only wait and see what the longer term impacts will be.

401
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,580
So that's about it from me.

402
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,580
Thanks for watching.

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:28,580
