1. **Trusting Instincts**: While it's often advised to trust your instincts, this isn't always the best approach due to cognitive biases like confirmation bias and motivated reasoning. These biases make you favor evidence that supports your preconceived notions and dismiss evidence that contradicts them.

2. **Confirmation Bias**: This is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses.

3. **Motivated Reasoning**: Similar to confirmation bias, this is the process of devising reasons to believe something you want to be true, often to avoid dissonance between your belief system and new evidence.

4. **Examples**: These biases manifest in various situations, from political beliefs (e.g., gun control) to everyday occurrences like perceiving who did more dishes or believing the referee made an incorrect call in a sports game.

5. **Calibration**: It's important to calibrate your instincts and consider alternative hypotheses to avoid falling into the trap of believing only what supports your current beliefs.
