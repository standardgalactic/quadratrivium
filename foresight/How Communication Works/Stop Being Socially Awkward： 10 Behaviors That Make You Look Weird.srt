00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In this video, I'm going to identify 11 specific kinds of behavior that might cause other people to

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,640
think you're weird or socially awkward. And with each of these behaviors are things you can do

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,480
to appear more normal or less awkward. Hi everybody, I'm Bruce Lambert from HowCommunicationWorks.com.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,160
This is a channel where I teach you about communication skills so you can improve your

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,120
relationships, succeed at work, and be more confident and overall hopefully lead a more

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:30,480
fulfilling and meaningful life. I was on the social skills subreddit recently and a person

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,720
posted a very interesting comment and he said, when people ask you if they're acting weird,

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,160
don't respond with generalities and platitudes but give them specific advice. Basically,

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,080
this guy was saying, or I don't know if it's a man or a woman, this person was saying,

10
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,800
I think I'm weird and I get feedback in social situations that I'm weird or socially awkward.

11
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,160
But when I ask my friends, what specifically am I doing that makes you think I'm weird or

12
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,040
makes me seem socially awkward, they never give him or her a straight answer. They always respond

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,000
with platitudes like, oh, it's okay to be weird, just be yourself, ignore them. But of course,

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,880
for people who genuinely struggle, if they're socially outcast, if they're socially isolated,

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,880
because they're perceived as weird or socially awkward or unusual or abnormal or whatever it might

16
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,280
be, these are real concerns. People need real feedback. They don't need platitudes like, oh,

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,480
it's okay to be weird. If you're really socially awkward, it causes you to be socially isolated

18
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,800
and that's extremely painful and damaging to the quality of your life. People in that situation

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,320
need specific feedback about what they're doing. And without knowing you specifically,

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,600
I can't give you feedback on your behavior. But I did identify specific categories of behavior

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,840
that are about social norms of behavior and that if you violate them, you are going to be perceived

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,120
to be weird or socially awkward or abnormal. These are the categories of behavior that in my own

23
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,160
experience as a communication professional, when I see people violating these norms or when I see

24
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,600
people that are socially awkward or weird or socially outcast or isolated, it's often these

25
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,560
behaviors that cause that perception. And each of these behaviors is specific enough that they can

26
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,920
be corrected. It may take coaching, someone has to observe your specific behavior in order for

27
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,320
them to coach you and help you. But these are the areas that you might be able to target.

28
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
You could videotape yourself and so on, but actually coaching or therapy or some kind of

29
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,400
professional help is probably going to be needed to fix or remedy these problems if you have them.

30
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,080
I want to add one more thing before I get to the list and that is that when we perceive someone as

31
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,320
weird or socially awkward, it's kind of a gestalt perception. What that means is like,

32
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,040
it's an overall impression we get of someone and people who are not trained in communication or in

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,160
the observation of behavior, all they have is this overall impression, oh, that person is strange.

34
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,600
That person is different, they're unusual, they're awkward, but they can't when pressed to say,

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,320
what is it that makes them strange? Many people, because they're not trained in communication,

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,760
can't pinpoint exactly what it is about their behavior. But it's my belief that it is specific

37
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,880
behaviors. That's all that people can see. When people see you as abnormal or unusual or awkward

38
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,600
or whatever, all they have to go on is your behavior and then their inferences about you

39
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,960
based on that behavior. But I think it's specific observable behaviors that can be learned and

40
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,720
changed that are at the root of these perceptions that you are weird or awkward. And so here they are.

41
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,280
Number one, too much or too little eye contact. There are norms about eye contact and you cannot

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,800
make too much eye contact or else you seem like some sort of stalker or some sort of crazed lunatic

43
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,920
if you just bear down on people and look them in the eye too much, you're going to seem unusual,

44
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,280
weird or awkward. So too much eye contact is overbearing and uncomfortable and will make people

45
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,760
think you are violating these norms and they'll make the inference then you're weird or you're

46
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,080
socially awkward. Don't make too much eye contact when you're talking sexually normal to look away

47
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,120
for a while and then return your gaze to the person when you're done talking. It's not a staring

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,120
contest. Be sure to blink, be sure to look away, be sure to look down. Similarly, not enough eye

49
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,320
contact is also going to be perceived as weird or unusual. If you never make eye contact, you're

50
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:20,320
going to be perceived as really shy or withdrawn or not interested. The eyes are the window to the

51
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,520
soul. The face is the center of where most communication takes place in face to face ordinary

52
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,160
interaction. So you've got to make some eye contact when especially when you're listening,

53
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,760
it's more normal to make more eye contact. Even though the other person is looking away, you

54
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,160
should make eye contact. So when they look back at you, you're looking at them and they know that

55
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,120
you're listening. So make sufficient eye contact but not too much. Maybe that rule is hard to learn

56
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,440
and if you're awkward, you're thinking, I don't know how much too much is. I don't know how much

57
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,160
not enough is. This is why you're going to need coaching or you're able to have to study people

58
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:59,200
who are socially skilled and see how they make eye contact. Point number two, not enough or too much

59
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,960
interpersonal space or distance. And I think normally the issue will be not enough space,

60
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,120
but sometimes it could be too much. This is really closely related to eye contact. There's about a

61
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,720
12 to 16 inch, 12 to 18 inch in America. This differs from country to country. But in America,

62
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,920
there's like about a 12 to 18 inch personal space bubble that should not be violated unless you're

63
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,680
on sort of intimate friendly terms with a person. But in in ordinary social contact in public,

64
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,280
you have to respect this 12 to 18 inch personal distance bubble. If you're a close talker, right,

65
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,120
who talked about that Seinfeld or somebody like that, you don't want to be one of those close

66
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,040
talkers. You're going to be perceived as awkward, weird, and so on. People are going to make inferences

67
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:43,280
about you and your social skills. Even if you're a lovely human being, you must respect this personal

68
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,200
space bubble. Now this will vary from culture to culture. Norms of social distance are culture

69
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,320
specific, but in America, it's about 12 to 18 inches. So keep your distance. If you enter into

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,720
that distance, then people will feel violated that you're violating their personal space.

71
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,040
If you stay three feet away when you're talking to someone, they're going to think you're weird

72
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,160
because that's too far away to be standing for an ordinary conversation unless you're in a group

73
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,880
when the norms are for slightly greater distances and higher volumes and so on. So again, study what

74
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
you see in socially skilled people, make those judgments and copy those social distances too

75
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,360
much or too little distance will make you seem weird. Number three, poor oral hygiene or poor

76
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,800
general hygiene. There's no way to say it. Maybe you smell, maybe your breath is really bad,

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,000
maybe your body odor is really bad. And here again, there are culturally specific norms.

78
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,520
In America, there are these norms about showering every day that the smell of the human body in

79
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,560
America is taboo. You shouldn't smell. Your breath shouldn't smell. Your body shouldn't smell. You

80
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,200
should shower once a day and have all sorts of perfumy soap and deodorant and stuff like that on.

81
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,200
In other parts of the world, the normal smells of the human body are more acceptable and the

82
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,360
norms about breath or body odor are different. If you've traveled around the world, you'll realize

83
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,520
this because the people smell differently in different parts of the world. But in America,

84
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,920
if you don't brush your teeth, if you don't use mouthwash and you come close to people that can

85
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,720
smell your breath and it's really bad, they are going to think you're unclean. And they may then

86
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,200
make other inferences about you being a strange, isolated person that they don't want to interact

87
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:23,600
with. So in America, you can't have obvious body odor. You can't have a halitosis, bad breath.

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,920
You've got to brush your teeth, use mouthwash, chew gum, use breath mints, and you've got to

89
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,800
clean yourself. You can't have a perspiration that really smells or any other kind of body odor,

90
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,880
or the strong odor of food. It may not be fair, it may not be realistic, it varies from culture

91
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,880
to culture, but these are the norms in America. And if you violate them, you're going to be seen

92
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,400
as weird. Number four, lack of a filter. You say taboo things. That is, you use profanity when you

93
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,280
shouldn't. You talk about religion or politics in ways which offend people. You have no filter.

94
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,320
You say exactly what you think without regard to politeness or appropriateness to the situation,

95
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:03,600
or decorum, or respect, or poise, or dignity. You lack those things. You have no filter. You just

96
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:10,560
say whatever's on your mind without regard to relevance or appropriateness. And if you act

97
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,880
that way without any filter, people are going to think you're weird. The norms of human behavior,

98
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:21,840
the norms of human communication dictate that you avoid certain taboo topics, that you don't try to

99
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,600
raise too much controversy, that you don't shame people and embarrass them, and so on. So you have

100
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,240
to learn rules of appropriateness. So if I say be appropriate, you might say, but I'm weird,

101
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,560
I'm socially awkward, I don't know what appropriateness is. There are some rules that you can learn.

102
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,760
And I already mentioned a couple. You normally don't bring up religion and politics and sex

103
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,120
body parts, body odors, stuff like that, that's going to be really divisive in polite company,

104
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,800
or else you're going to be perceived as not understanding the norms of behavior. And anyone

105
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,080
who violates those norms will be seen as someone who's not safe to interact with,

106
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,600
otherwise known as weird or awkward. Number six, you don't cooperate in face work. So I have a whole,

107
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,920
a couple of other videos on Irving Goff and the expressive order and face work and so on going

108
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
all the way back to my very first video. So face is the positive social value we claim for

109
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,040
ourselves. It's dignity, pride, self-esteem, the fact that I am somebody who deserves respect.

110
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,320
So in ordinary interaction, you have a commitment not to embarrass yourself and not to allow other

111
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,200
people to be embarrassed, either to embarrass themselves or be embarrassed by you. So often

112
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,720
people who are perceived as weird or socially awkward don't know how to do face work. They're

113
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
not familiar. They don't know how to maintain the expressive order. And I'll link to my video about

114
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,160
the expressive order and what that is. They allow, they embarrass themselves by acting in strange

115
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,680
ways, which are violating norms. It's not okay to violate these social norms if you want to be seen

116
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,840
as normal. Or they allow other people to be embarrassed and they don't help repair embarrassment.

117
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:58,480
If other people are not confident that if they slip up that you'll help them avoid embarrassment,

118
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,120
you won't be seen as safe to interact with. And they'll see you as weird and abnormal. So if you

119
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,480
don't cooperate in face work, helping other people save face and not allowing yourself to lose face,

120
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,240
people might see you as weird or awkward. Number seven, too much or too little self-disclosure.

121
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,680
So self-disclosure, I wrote an email about this to my mailing list. I should post it on the website,

122
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,440
but I haven't. But I haven't made a video about this yet. Self-disclosure is the process of telling

123
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,360
people about ourselves, minor superficial details and then deep personal details about ourselves.

124
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,840
And generally, there's a progression. People who we hardly know, we tell them superficial

125
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,080
things about ourselves, like our name, what city we live in, what we do for a living,

126
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,960
maybe what some of our superficial interests are. And then as the relationship gets more intimate,

127
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,840
we reveal and disclose more intimate details about ourselves. That's the general progression

128
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:55,600
of self-disclosure. There are norms of self-disclosure. And if you violate them, you will be seen as

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,040
abnormal or awkward or weird. In the beginning of a relationship, do not disclose too much.

130
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,640
Your name, rank and serial number is about it, right? Your name, where you live,

131
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,160
what you do for a living, what maybe some of your hobbies are, if they're not taboo topics, you know.

132
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,840
Maybe what music or television or movies that you like or books, these are all safe topics.

133
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,680
And things that you could disclose about yourself early in a relationship where you're just meeting

134
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,640
new people. These are safe things to disclose. So don't disclose too much. If you meet new people

135
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,280
and suddenly start telling them about your deep psychological problems, about your addictions,

136
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,000
about your abuse history, about your mental health problems, about the most embarrassing and

137
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,480
shameful things about yourself or your life history, those things are all valid. Those experiences

138
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,800
are all valid. And eventually you want a friend that you can share them with, but not when you

139
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,760
first meet someone. It's not appropriate. People will be like, ah, too much information. This person

140
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,560
is weird and awkward. I don't want to interact with him. Similarly, if you never reveal anything

141
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,920
about yourself, people will not trust you. I used to know somebody. This person is not really part

142
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
of my life anymore, but I used to know somebody and she was a very good listener. So people would

143
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,520
tell her things, but she would never reveal anything about herself. So ultimately people didn't

144
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:12,400
trust her because if you never reveal anything about yourself, you're violating this norm of

145
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:17,200
self-disclosure, which says if I tell you something, then you tell me something of sort of equal

146
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,080
intimacy. You meet a new person and they tell you their name and where they live and kind of what

147
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,920
their hobbies are and what they do for a living. And then you reveal none of that information

148
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,880
about yourself. You violated this norm of reciprocity and self-disclosure and you're going

149
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,920
to be seen as weird. Number eight, you lack a sense of relevance. So one of the norms in conversation

150
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:45,280
is be relevant. You have to contribute to the conversation in such a way as that your contribution

151
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:52,160
is relevant to the previous conversation. That is, there's a specific topic being talked about

152
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,560
and the person who had the last turn at talk is talking about a specific topic and then it's

153
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,000
your turn to talk. You are obliged more or less to talk about the same topic or at least to say

154
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,200
something that is related to, relevant to the same topic. If you're perceived generally as awkward

155
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,320
or weird, you may have difficulty knowing what's relevant. So just stick to the same topic. Don't

156
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,640
try to change the subject too much. Extremely abrupt changes of subject will seem really strange.

157
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:25,840
If you deviate from the topic or say these non sequiturs, a non sequiturs of Latin for you

158
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:31,440
are not in the proper sequence out of place and a non sequiturs just to mention something on one

159
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,320
topic which totally is unrelated to the previous topic that was on the floor or being discussed

160
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,440
in the conversation. So if you are perceived as weird, it might be because you have not mastered

161
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,440
the sense of relevance. You must stay on topic. Number nine, you don't know how to gracefully

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,480
enter or leave an interaction. So there are norms around and rituals around entering and

163
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:03,200
leaving interactions. And if you enter or leave too abruptly or if you enter or leave too slowly,

164
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,920
sort of hard to know what it means to enter too slowly, but you can certainly leave too slowly

165
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,840
if someone is trying to end the conversation, they're going, all right, okay, great to meet you.

166
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,840
Wow, it's really a pleasure to have met you. I've got to get going. Okay, all right,

167
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,440
all right then. Okay, and you're still not leaving. Those are all cues for you to leave.

168
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,760
If you're missing all those cues and you linger and keep talking and won't let a person go when

169
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,840
they give you signals to go, they'll think you're weird or awkward and they won't want to interact

170
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,480
with you. So you've got to let people take their leave. Even if you want to keep talking with them,

171
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
when they signal that they're ready to leave, you have to let them leave. And when you enter

172
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,360
into a conversation, you can't just barge in if other people are talking, you have to enter in

173
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,840
slowly and appropriately. And if you're invited in to a conversation, because someone mentions your

174
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:56,080
name or they motion you over, you don't accept that invitation, you're going to be seen as awkward.

175
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,880
So entering and leaving are rituals, you have to master those rituals, or else you're going to be

176
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,120
seen as awkward or weird. Number 10, you don't use back channel cues. And so people never know

177
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:14,480
whether you're listening. A back channel cue is just something like, uh-huh. Oh, tell me more.

178
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
These are back channel cues, the little things that we do to let people know that we're still

179
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,400
listening. They give people cues that, yes, I'm still listening. I'm still here. They're important

180
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,760
on the telephone and they're important in face-to-face interaction. If you just sit there,

181
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,880
you think listening is about being silent and someone's talking and you're just...

182
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,800
They're going to think you're awkward or weird. You might be listening really

183
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,800
intently. You might be waiting for your chance to talk. But listening is actually an active thing

184
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,600
that you have to contribute. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Tell me more. Stuff like

185
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,440
that, that lets people know you're listening. So if you don't give back channel cues, people are

186
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,280
going to think you're not listening or you're not paying attention or you're just kind of weird.

187
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:04,400
And number 11, I don't have enough fingers for, number 11, you lack empathy. If people see you

188
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,880
as weird or awkward, it's possible that you lack empathy. Now, I have an entire playlist about

189
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,720
empathy, which you should check out because it's too big a topic for me to talk about in this video.

190
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,440
But it may be that you lack empathy. What that means is you may lack the ability to recognize

191
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,720
other people's feelings or to accurately identify other people's feelings or to relate them to

192
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,360
your own experience or to understand other people's perspectives, their plans, their goals,

193
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,520
their intentions, and their beliefs. Uh, you may lack the ability to say, to acknowledge people's

194
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:40,320
feelings. You may not have enough altruism or compassion when people are hurting that you

195
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,960
reach out and do and say kind things in order to help relieve their suffering. All of these are

196
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,920
elements of empathy. And if people perceive you a lot of the time as weird or awkward,

197
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,760
you may not have mastered empathic listening and empathic skills, which have to do with

198
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,560
feeling other people's feelings, identifying other people's feelings correctly, naming them,

199
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,280
asking people to elaborate on them, and then saying comforting things to them. As I said,

200
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,800
lots and lots of other videos, this whole channel is kind of an empathy channel. So there's lots

201
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:15,440
to learn if those are your skills. So there you have it. 11 specific behaviors that if you're

202
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,800
not adhering to the norms of behavior in these 11 domains, it's quite likely others will perceive

203
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:26,800
you as abnormal, weird, or awkward. The good news is all of these are learnable skills,

204
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,320
even if you might be on the autism spectrum or have Asperger's or other challenges in your life

205
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,640
that make it difficult for you to perceive social nuances, or maybe you just grew up in a family

206
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,800
where you didn't get this kind of training and you're just in a situation where you have a lot

207
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,320
more to learn. That's what this channel is for. And I really, really want to help. So I think that

208
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,480
the previous videos I've made on conversation skills and empathy and listening are targeted

209
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,560
a lot of these deficits. If you're struggling with this idea that you're weird or socially awkward,

210
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:01,760
it is because of these specific observable behaviors that you are capable of changing,

211
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,720
not without effort. And you may never be able to be as smooth as the most socially skilled person.

212
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,800
But I think you can greatly decrease the perception that you're weird or awkward

213
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,280
by working on these specific learnable social skills. I'll say one more thing about being

214
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,000
weird before I sign off. It's totally okay to have unusual ideas, unusual beliefs. One of the

215
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,400
platitudes that people say to people who are feel themselves to be socially awkward or weird is,

216
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,240
Oh, I like weird people. It's okay to be weird. I think what they're saying there is it's okay

217
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,800
to be quirky. It's okay to be unusual. It's okay to have slightly different beliefs.

218
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,760
But when we go, there are norms of human behavior, including norms for what attitudes and beliefs

219
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,960
we can hold in a given culture in a given time in history. If you go too far outside those norms,

220
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,800
you will pay the price as someone who's a non conformist and socially outcast and so on. So

221
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,720
you have to do that calculation on your own. If you have very, very, if you have beliefs that

222
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,760
are very far outside the norm or behaviors that are very far outside the norm, one of the prices

223
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,080
socially you might pay for that is a certain amount of ostracism or being isolated or perceived

224
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,720
as weird or awkward. But if you have normal beliefs and attitudes, which are within the

225
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,160
norms for our time and place in history, but that you just haven't mastered all these communication

226
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,640
skills, I think there's really a route for you to be seen as as much more normal than you might

227
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,000

help you overcome what's really a painful situation to be seen as weird or awkward. We'll see you next
