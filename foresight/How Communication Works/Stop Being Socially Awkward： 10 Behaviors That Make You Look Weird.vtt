00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
In this video, I'm going to identify 11 specific kinds of behavior that might cause other people to

00:06.000 --> 00:10.640
think you're weird or socially awkward. And with each of these behaviors are things you can do

00:10.640 --> 00:16.480
to appear more normal or less awkward. Hi everybody, I'm Bruce Lambert from HowCommunicationWorks.com.

00:16.480 --> 00:20.160
This is a channel where I teach you about communication skills so you can improve your

00:20.160 --> 00:25.120
relationships, succeed at work, and be more confident and overall hopefully lead a more

00:25.120 --> 00:30.480
fulfilling and meaningful life. I was on the social skills subreddit recently and a person

00:30.480 --> 00:36.720
posted a very interesting comment and he said, when people ask you if they're acting weird,

00:36.720 --> 00:42.160
don't respond with generalities and platitudes but give them specific advice. Basically,

00:42.160 --> 00:46.080
this guy was saying, or I don't know if it's a man or a woman, this person was saying,

00:46.080 --> 00:50.800
I think I'm weird and I get feedback in social situations that I'm weird or socially awkward.

00:50.800 --> 00:56.160
But when I ask my friends, what specifically am I doing that makes you think I'm weird or

00:56.160 --> 01:01.040
makes me seem socially awkward, they never give him or her a straight answer. They always respond

01:01.040 --> 01:06.000
with platitudes like, oh, it's okay to be weird, just be yourself, ignore them. But of course,

01:06.000 --> 01:10.880
for people who genuinely struggle, if they're socially outcast, if they're socially isolated,

01:10.880 --> 01:16.880
because they're perceived as weird or socially awkward or unusual or abnormal or whatever it might

01:16.960 --> 01:23.280
be, these are real concerns. People need real feedback. They don't need platitudes like, oh,

01:23.280 --> 01:28.480
it's okay to be weird. If you're really socially awkward, it causes you to be socially isolated

01:28.480 --> 01:32.800
and that's extremely painful and damaging to the quality of your life. People in that situation

01:32.800 --> 01:38.320
need specific feedback about what they're doing. And without knowing you specifically,

01:38.320 --> 01:43.600
I can't give you feedback on your behavior. But I did identify specific categories of behavior

01:44.160 --> 01:49.840
that are about social norms of behavior and that if you violate them, you are going to be perceived

01:49.840 --> 01:55.120
to be weird or socially awkward or abnormal. These are the categories of behavior that in my own

01:55.120 --> 02:00.160
experience as a communication professional, when I see people violating these norms or when I see

02:00.160 --> 02:05.600
people that are socially awkward or weird or socially outcast or isolated, it's often these

02:05.600 --> 02:10.560
behaviors that cause that perception. And each of these behaviors is specific enough that they can

02:10.560 --> 02:15.920
be corrected. It may take coaching, someone has to observe your specific behavior in order for

02:15.920 --> 02:20.320
them to coach you and help you. But these are the areas that you might be able to target.

02:20.320 --> 02:24.720
You could videotape yourself and so on, but actually coaching or therapy or some kind of

02:24.720 --> 02:30.400
professional help is probably going to be needed to fix or remedy these problems if you have them.

02:30.400 --> 02:34.080
I want to add one more thing before I get to the list and that is that when we perceive someone as

02:34.080 --> 02:38.320
weird or socially awkward, it's kind of a gestalt perception. What that means is like,

02:38.320 --> 02:45.040
it's an overall impression we get of someone and people who are not trained in communication or in

02:45.040 --> 02:50.160
the observation of behavior, all they have is this overall impression, oh, that person is strange.

02:50.160 --> 02:55.600
That person is different, they're unusual, they're awkward, but they can't when pressed to say,

02:55.600 --> 03:00.320
what is it that makes them strange? Many people, because they're not trained in communication,

03:00.320 --> 03:05.760
can't pinpoint exactly what it is about their behavior. But it's my belief that it is specific

03:05.840 --> 03:10.880
behaviors. That's all that people can see. When people see you as abnormal or unusual or awkward

03:10.880 --> 03:15.600
or whatever, all they have to go on is your behavior and then their inferences about you

03:15.600 --> 03:20.960
based on that behavior. But I think it's specific observable behaviors that can be learned and

03:20.960 --> 03:26.720
changed that are at the root of these perceptions that you are weird or awkward. And so here they are.

03:26.720 --> 03:33.280
Number one, too much or too little eye contact. There are norms about eye contact and you cannot

03:33.280 --> 03:38.800
make too much eye contact or else you seem like some sort of stalker or some sort of crazed lunatic

03:38.800 --> 03:43.920
if you just bear down on people and look them in the eye too much, you're going to seem unusual,

03:43.920 --> 03:49.280
weird or awkward. So too much eye contact is overbearing and uncomfortable and will make people

03:49.280 --> 03:53.760
think you are violating these norms and they'll make the inference then you're weird or you're

03:53.760 --> 03:58.080
socially awkward. Don't make too much eye contact when you're talking sexually normal to look away

03:58.080 --> 04:03.120
for a while and then return your gaze to the person when you're done talking. It's not a staring

04:03.120 --> 04:09.120
contest. Be sure to blink, be sure to look away, be sure to look down. Similarly, not enough eye

04:09.120 --> 04:14.320
contact is also going to be perceived as weird or unusual. If you never make eye contact, you're

04:14.320 --> 04:20.320
going to be perceived as really shy or withdrawn or not interested. The eyes are the window to the

04:20.320 --> 04:25.520
soul. The face is the center of where most communication takes place in face to face ordinary

04:25.520 --> 04:30.160
interaction. So you've got to make some eye contact when especially when you're listening,

04:30.160 --> 04:33.760
it's more normal to make more eye contact. Even though the other person is looking away, you

04:33.760 --> 04:38.160
should make eye contact. So when they look back at you, you're looking at them and they know that

04:38.160 --> 04:43.120
you're listening. So make sufficient eye contact but not too much. Maybe that rule is hard to learn

04:43.120 --> 04:47.440
and if you're awkward, you're thinking, I don't know how much too much is. I don't know how much

04:47.440 --> 04:52.160
not enough is. This is why you're going to need coaching or you're able to have to study people

04:52.160 --> 04:59.200
who are socially skilled and see how they make eye contact. Point number two, not enough or too much

04:59.760 --> 05:04.960
interpersonal space or distance. And I think normally the issue will be not enough space,

05:04.960 --> 05:09.120
but sometimes it could be too much. This is really closely related to eye contact. There's about a

05:09.120 --> 05:14.720
12 to 16 inch, 12 to 18 inch in America. This differs from country to country. But in America,

05:14.720 --> 05:19.920
there's like about a 12 to 18 inch personal space bubble that should not be violated unless you're

05:19.920 --> 05:25.680
on sort of intimate friendly terms with a person. But in in ordinary social contact in public,

05:25.680 --> 05:31.280
you have to respect this 12 to 18 inch personal distance bubble. If you're a close talker, right,

05:31.280 --> 05:35.120
who talked about that Seinfeld or somebody like that, you don't want to be one of those close

05:35.120 --> 05:39.040
talkers. You're going to be perceived as awkward, weird, and so on. People are going to make inferences

05:39.040 --> 05:43.280
about you and your social skills. Even if you're a lovely human being, you must respect this personal

05:43.280 --> 05:49.200
space bubble. Now this will vary from culture to culture. Norms of social distance are culture

05:49.200 --> 05:54.320
specific, but in America, it's about 12 to 18 inches. So keep your distance. If you enter into

05:54.400 --> 05:58.720
that distance, then people will feel violated that you're violating their personal space.

05:58.720 --> 06:03.040
If you stay three feet away when you're talking to someone, they're going to think you're weird

06:03.040 --> 06:08.160
because that's too far away to be standing for an ordinary conversation unless you're in a group

06:08.160 --> 06:14.880
when the norms are for slightly greater distances and higher volumes and so on. So again, study what

06:14.880 --> 06:19.280
you see in socially skilled people, make those judgments and copy those social distances too

06:19.280 --> 06:25.360
much or too little distance will make you seem weird. Number three, poor oral hygiene or poor

06:25.360 --> 06:30.800
general hygiene. There's no way to say it. Maybe you smell, maybe your breath is really bad,

06:30.800 --> 06:36.000
maybe your body odor is really bad. And here again, there are culturally specific norms.

06:36.000 --> 06:41.520
In America, there are these norms about showering every day that the smell of the human body in

06:41.520 --> 06:46.560
America is taboo. You shouldn't smell. Your breath shouldn't smell. Your body shouldn't smell. You

06:46.560 --> 06:51.200
should shower once a day and have all sorts of perfumy soap and deodorant and stuff like that on.

06:51.200 --> 06:55.200
In other parts of the world, the normal smells of the human body are more acceptable and the

06:55.200 --> 06:59.360
norms about breath or body odor are different. If you've traveled around the world, you'll realize

06:59.360 --> 07:03.520
this because the people smell differently in different parts of the world. But in America,

07:03.520 --> 07:07.920
if you don't brush your teeth, if you don't use mouthwash and you come close to people that can

07:07.920 --> 07:12.720
smell your breath and it's really bad, they are going to think you're unclean. And they may then

07:12.720 --> 07:17.200
make other inferences about you being a strange, isolated person that they don't want to interact

07:17.200 --> 07:23.600
with. So in America, you can't have obvious body odor. You can't have a halitosis, bad breath.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.920
You've got to brush your teeth, use mouthwash, chew gum, use breath mints, and you've got to

07:27.920 --> 07:32.800
clean yourself. You can't have a perspiration that really smells or any other kind of body odor,

07:32.800 --> 07:36.880
or the strong odor of food. It may not be fair, it may not be realistic, it varies from culture

07:36.880 --> 07:40.880
to culture, but these are the norms in America. And if you violate them, you're going to be seen

07:40.880 --> 07:48.400
as weird. Number four, lack of a filter. You say taboo things. That is, you use profanity when you

07:48.400 --> 07:53.280
shouldn't. You talk about religion or politics in ways which offend people. You have no filter.

07:53.280 --> 07:58.320
You say exactly what you think without regard to politeness or appropriateness to the situation,

07:58.320 --> 08:03.600
or decorum, or respect, or poise, or dignity. You lack those things. You have no filter. You just

08:03.600 --> 08:10.560
say whatever's on your mind without regard to relevance or appropriateness. And if you act

08:10.560 --> 08:14.880
that way without any filter, people are going to think you're weird. The norms of human behavior,

08:14.880 --> 08:21.840
the norms of human communication dictate that you avoid certain taboo topics, that you don't try to

08:21.840 --> 08:25.600
raise too much controversy, that you don't shame people and embarrass them, and so on. So you have

08:25.600 --> 08:30.240
to learn rules of appropriateness. So if I say be appropriate, you might say, but I'm weird,

08:30.240 --> 08:34.560
I'm socially awkward, I don't know what appropriateness is. There are some rules that you can learn.

08:34.560 --> 08:39.760
And I already mentioned a couple. You normally don't bring up religion and politics and sex

08:40.720 --> 08:47.120
body parts, body odors, stuff like that, that's going to be really divisive in polite company,

08:47.760 --> 08:50.800
or else you're going to be perceived as not understanding the norms of behavior. And anyone

08:50.800 --> 08:54.080
who violates those norms will be seen as someone who's not safe to interact with,

08:54.080 --> 09:01.600
otherwise known as weird or awkward. Number six, you don't cooperate in face work. So I have a whole,

09:01.600 --> 09:05.920
a couple of other videos on Irving Goff and the expressive order and face work and so on going

09:05.920 --> 09:10.240
all the way back to my very first video. So face is the positive social value we claim for

09:10.240 --> 09:15.040
ourselves. It's dignity, pride, self-esteem, the fact that I am somebody who deserves respect.

09:15.040 --> 09:22.320
So in ordinary interaction, you have a commitment not to embarrass yourself and not to allow other

09:22.320 --> 09:27.200
people to be embarrassed, either to embarrass themselves or be embarrassed by you. So often

09:27.200 --> 09:32.720
people who are perceived as weird or socially awkward don't know how to do face work. They're

09:32.720 --> 09:36.560
not familiar. They don't know how to maintain the expressive order. And I'll link to my video about

09:36.560 --> 09:42.160
the expressive order and what that is. They allow, they embarrass themselves by acting in strange

09:42.160 --> 09:47.680
ways, which are violating norms. It's not okay to violate these social norms if you want to be seen

09:47.680 --> 09:53.840
as normal. Or they allow other people to be embarrassed and they don't help repair embarrassment.

09:53.840 --> 09:58.480
If other people are not confident that if they slip up that you'll help them avoid embarrassment,

09:58.480 --> 10:03.120
you won't be seen as safe to interact with. And they'll see you as weird and abnormal. So if you

10:03.120 --> 10:08.480
don't cooperate in face work, helping other people save face and not allowing yourself to lose face,

10:08.480 --> 10:14.240
people might see you as weird or awkward. Number seven, too much or too little self-disclosure.

10:14.240 --> 10:19.680
So self-disclosure, I wrote an email about this to my mailing list. I should post it on the website,

10:19.680 --> 10:25.440
but I haven't. But I haven't made a video about this yet. Self-disclosure is the process of telling

10:25.440 --> 10:31.360
people about ourselves, minor superficial details and then deep personal details about ourselves.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.840
And generally, there's a progression. People who we hardly know, we tell them superficial

10:35.840 --> 10:40.080
things about ourselves, like our name, what city we live in, what we do for a living,

10:40.080 --> 10:44.960
maybe what some of our superficial interests are. And then as the relationship gets more intimate,

10:44.960 --> 10:49.840
we reveal and disclose more intimate details about ourselves. That's the general progression

10:49.840 --> 10:55.600
of self-disclosure. There are norms of self-disclosure. And if you violate them, you will be seen as

10:55.600 --> 11:01.040
abnormal or awkward or weird. In the beginning of a relationship, do not disclose too much.

11:01.040 --> 11:04.640
Your name, rank and serial number is about it, right? Your name, where you live,

11:04.640 --> 11:10.160
what you do for a living, what maybe some of your hobbies are, if they're not taboo topics, you know.

11:10.160 --> 11:15.840
Maybe what music or television or movies that you like or books, these are all safe topics.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.680
And things that you could disclose about yourself early in a relationship where you're just meeting

11:19.680 --> 11:24.640
new people. These are safe things to disclose. So don't disclose too much. If you meet new people

11:24.640 --> 11:29.280
and suddenly start telling them about your deep psychological problems, about your addictions,

11:29.280 --> 11:34.000
about your abuse history, about your mental health problems, about the most embarrassing and

11:34.000 --> 11:38.480
shameful things about yourself or your life history, those things are all valid. Those experiences

11:38.480 --> 11:42.800
are all valid. And eventually you want a friend that you can share them with, but not when you

11:42.800 --> 11:47.760
first meet someone. It's not appropriate. People will be like, ah, too much information. This person

11:47.760 --> 11:52.560
is weird and awkward. I don't want to interact with him. Similarly, if you never reveal anything

11:52.560 --> 11:57.920
about yourself, people will not trust you. I used to know somebody. This person is not really part

11:57.920 --> 12:02.000
of my life anymore, but I used to know somebody and she was a very good listener. So people would

12:02.000 --> 12:07.520
tell her things, but she would never reveal anything about herself. So ultimately people didn't

12:07.520 --> 12:12.400
trust her because if you never reveal anything about yourself, you're violating this norm of

12:12.400 --> 12:17.200
self-disclosure, which says if I tell you something, then you tell me something of sort of equal

12:17.200 --> 12:22.080
intimacy. You meet a new person and they tell you their name and where they live and kind of what

12:22.080 --> 12:25.920
their hobbies are and what they do for a living. And then you reveal none of that information

12:25.920 --> 12:30.880
about yourself. You violated this norm of reciprocity and self-disclosure and you're going

12:30.880 --> 12:37.920
to be seen as weird. Number eight, you lack a sense of relevance. So one of the norms in conversation

12:37.920 --> 12:45.280
is be relevant. You have to contribute to the conversation in such a way as that your contribution

12:45.280 --> 12:52.160
is relevant to the previous conversation. That is, there's a specific topic being talked about

12:52.160 --> 12:56.560
and the person who had the last turn at talk is talking about a specific topic and then it's

12:56.560 --> 13:02.000
your turn to talk. You are obliged more or less to talk about the same topic or at least to say

13:02.000 --> 13:09.200
something that is related to, relevant to the same topic. If you're perceived generally as awkward

13:09.200 --> 13:14.320
or weird, you may have difficulty knowing what's relevant. So just stick to the same topic. Don't

13:14.320 --> 13:20.640
try to change the subject too much. Extremely abrupt changes of subject will seem really strange.

13:20.640 --> 13:25.840
If you deviate from the topic or say these non sequiturs, a non sequiturs of Latin for you

13:25.840 --> 13:31.440
are not in the proper sequence out of place and a non sequiturs just to mention something on one

13:31.440 --> 13:36.320
topic which totally is unrelated to the previous topic that was on the floor or being discussed

13:36.320 --> 13:41.440
in the conversation. So if you are perceived as weird, it might be because you have not mastered

13:41.440 --> 13:47.440
the sense of relevance. You must stay on topic. Number nine, you don't know how to gracefully

13:48.000 --> 13:54.480
enter or leave an interaction. So there are norms around and rituals around entering and

13:54.480 --> 14:03.200
leaving interactions. And if you enter or leave too abruptly or if you enter or leave too slowly,

14:03.200 --> 14:07.920
sort of hard to know what it means to enter too slowly, but you can certainly leave too slowly

14:07.920 --> 14:13.840
if someone is trying to end the conversation, they're going, all right, okay, great to meet you.

14:14.320 --> 14:19.840
Wow, it's really a pleasure to have met you. I've got to get going. Okay, all right,

14:20.480 --> 14:25.440
all right then. Okay, and you're still not leaving. Those are all cues for you to leave.

14:25.440 --> 14:29.760
If you're missing all those cues and you linger and keep talking and won't let a person go when

14:29.760 --> 14:33.840
they give you signals to go, they'll think you're weird or awkward and they won't want to interact

14:33.840 --> 14:38.480
with you. So you've got to let people take their leave. Even if you want to keep talking with them,

14:38.480 --> 14:41.920
when they signal that they're ready to leave, you have to let them leave. And when you enter

14:41.920 --> 14:47.360
into a conversation, you can't just barge in if other people are talking, you have to enter in

14:47.360 --> 14:51.840
slowly and appropriately. And if you're invited in to a conversation, because someone mentions your

14:51.840 --> 14:56.080
name or they motion you over, you don't accept that invitation, you're going to be seen as awkward.

14:56.080 --> 15:00.880
So entering and leaving are rituals, you have to master those rituals, or else you're going to be

15:00.880 --> 15:07.120
seen as awkward or weird. Number 10, you don't use back channel cues. And so people never know

15:07.120 --> 15:14.480
whether you're listening. A back channel cue is just something like, uh-huh. Oh, tell me more.

15:14.480 --> 15:19.360
These are back channel cues, the little things that we do to let people know that we're still

15:19.360 --> 15:24.400
listening. They give people cues that, yes, I'm still listening. I'm still here. They're important

15:24.400 --> 15:27.760
on the telephone and they're important in face-to-face interaction. If you just sit there,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.880
you think listening is about being silent and someone's talking and you're just...

15:31.280 --> 15:36.800
They're going to think you're awkward or weird. You might be listening really

15:36.800 --> 15:42.800
intently. You might be waiting for your chance to talk. But listening is actually an active thing

15:42.800 --> 15:49.600
that you have to contribute. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Tell me more. Stuff like

15:49.600 --> 15:53.440
that, that lets people know you're listening. So if you don't give back channel cues, people are

15:53.440 --> 15:57.280
going to think you're not listening or you're not paying attention or you're just kind of weird.

15:57.280 --> 16:04.400
And number 11, I don't have enough fingers for, number 11, you lack empathy. If people see you

16:04.400 --> 16:08.880
as weird or awkward, it's possible that you lack empathy. Now, I have an entire playlist about

16:08.880 --> 16:12.720
empathy, which you should check out because it's too big a topic for me to talk about in this video.

16:13.360 --> 16:19.440
But it may be that you lack empathy. What that means is you may lack the ability to recognize

16:19.440 --> 16:24.720
other people's feelings or to accurately identify other people's feelings or to relate them to

16:24.720 --> 16:29.360
your own experience or to understand other people's perspectives, their plans, their goals,

16:29.360 --> 16:35.520
their intentions, and their beliefs. Uh, you may lack the ability to say, to acknowledge people's

16:35.520 --> 16:40.320
feelings. You may not have enough altruism or compassion when people are hurting that you

16:40.320 --> 16:44.960
reach out and do and say kind things in order to help relieve their suffering. All of these are

16:44.960 --> 16:49.920
elements of empathy. And if people perceive you a lot of the time as weird or awkward,

16:49.920 --> 16:55.760
you may not have mastered empathic listening and empathic skills, which have to do with

16:56.320 --> 17:00.560
feeling other people's feelings, identifying other people's feelings correctly, naming them,

17:01.120 --> 17:05.280
asking people to elaborate on them, and then saying comforting things to them. As I said,

17:05.280 --> 17:08.800
lots and lots of other videos, this whole channel is kind of an empathy channel. So there's lots

17:08.800 --> 17:15.440
to learn if those are your skills. So there you have it. 11 specific behaviors that if you're

17:15.440 --> 17:20.800
not adhering to the norms of behavior in these 11 domains, it's quite likely others will perceive

17:20.800 --> 17:26.800
you as abnormal, weird, or awkward. The good news is all of these are learnable skills,

17:26.800 --> 17:32.320
even if you might be on the autism spectrum or have Asperger's or other challenges in your life

17:32.320 --> 17:36.640
that make it difficult for you to perceive social nuances, or maybe you just grew up in a family

17:36.640 --> 17:40.800
where you didn't get this kind of training and you're just in a situation where you have a lot

17:40.800 --> 17:46.320
more to learn. That's what this channel is for. And I really, really want to help. So I think that

17:46.320 --> 17:50.480
the previous videos I've made on conversation skills and empathy and listening are targeted

17:50.480 --> 17:56.560
a lot of these deficits. If you're struggling with this idea that you're weird or socially awkward,

17:56.560 --> 18:01.760
it is because of these specific observable behaviors that you are capable of changing,

18:01.760 --> 18:06.720
not without effort. And you may never be able to be as smooth as the most socially skilled person.

18:06.720 --> 18:10.800
But I think you can greatly decrease the perception that you're weird or awkward

18:11.360 --> 18:17.280
by working on these specific learnable social skills. I'll say one more thing about being

18:17.280 --> 18:24.000
weird before I sign off. It's totally okay to have unusual ideas, unusual beliefs. One of the

18:24.000 --> 18:28.400
platitudes that people say to people who are feel themselves to be socially awkward or weird is,

18:28.400 --> 18:32.240
Oh, I like weird people. It's okay to be weird. I think what they're saying there is it's okay

18:32.240 --> 18:36.800
to be quirky. It's okay to be unusual. It's okay to have slightly different beliefs.

18:36.800 --> 18:41.760
But when we go, there are norms of human behavior, including norms for what attitudes and beliefs

18:41.760 --> 18:46.960
we can hold in a given culture in a given time in history. If you go too far outside those norms,

18:46.960 --> 18:52.800
you will pay the price as someone who's a non conformist and socially outcast and so on. So

18:52.800 --> 18:56.720
you have to do that calculation on your own. If you have very, very, if you have beliefs that

18:56.720 --> 19:01.760
are very far outside the norm or behaviors that are very far outside the norm, one of the prices

19:01.760 --> 19:06.080
socially you might pay for that is a certain amount of ostracism or being isolated or perceived

19:06.080 --> 19:10.720
as weird or awkward. But if you have normal beliefs and attitudes, which are within the

19:10.720 --> 19:16.160
norms for our time and place in history, but that you just haven't mastered all these communication

19:16.160 --> 19:20.640
skills, I think there's really a route for you to be seen as as much more normal than you might

19:20.640 --> 19:26.000
