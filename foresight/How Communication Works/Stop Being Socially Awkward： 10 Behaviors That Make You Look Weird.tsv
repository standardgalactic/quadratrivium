0	6000	In this video, I'm going to identify 11 specific kinds of behavior that might cause other people to
6000	10640	think you're weird or socially awkward. And with each of these behaviors are things you can do
10640	16480	to appear more normal or less awkward. Hi everybody, I'm Bruce Lambert from HowCommunicationWorks.com.
16480	20160	This is a channel where I teach you about communication skills so you can improve your
20160	25120	relationships, succeed at work, and be more confident and overall hopefully lead a more
25120	30480	fulfilling and meaningful life. I was on the social skills subreddit recently and a person
30480	36720	posted a very interesting comment and he said, when people ask you if they're acting weird,
36720	42160	don't respond with generalities and platitudes but give them specific advice. Basically,
42160	46080	this guy was saying, or I don't know if it's a man or a woman, this person was saying,
46080	50800	I think I'm weird and I get feedback in social situations that I'm weird or socially awkward.
50800	56160	But when I ask my friends, what specifically am I doing that makes you think I'm weird or
56160	61040	makes me seem socially awkward, they never give him or her a straight answer. They always respond
61040	66000	with platitudes like, oh, it's okay to be weird, just be yourself, ignore them. But of course,
66000	70880	for people who genuinely struggle, if they're socially outcast, if they're socially isolated,
70880	76880	because they're perceived as weird or socially awkward or unusual or abnormal or whatever it might
76960	83280	be, these are real concerns. People need real feedback. They don't need platitudes like, oh,
83280	88480	it's okay to be weird. If you're really socially awkward, it causes you to be socially isolated
88480	92800	and that's extremely painful and damaging to the quality of your life. People in that situation
92800	98320	need specific feedback about what they're doing. And without knowing you specifically,
98320	103600	I can't give you feedback on your behavior. But I did identify specific categories of behavior
104160	109840	that are about social norms of behavior and that if you violate them, you are going to be perceived
109840	115120	to be weird or socially awkward or abnormal. These are the categories of behavior that in my own
115120	120160	experience as a communication professional, when I see people violating these norms or when I see
120160	125600	people that are socially awkward or weird or socially outcast or isolated, it's often these
125600	130560	behaviors that cause that perception. And each of these behaviors is specific enough that they can
130560	135920	be corrected. It may take coaching, someone has to observe your specific behavior in order for
135920	140320	them to coach you and help you. But these are the areas that you might be able to target.
140320	144720	You could videotape yourself and so on, but actually coaching or therapy or some kind of
144720	150400	professional help is probably going to be needed to fix or remedy these problems if you have them.
150400	154080	I want to add one more thing before I get to the list and that is that when we perceive someone as
154080	158320	weird or socially awkward, it's kind of a gestalt perception. What that means is like,
158320	165040	it's an overall impression we get of someone and people who are not trained in communication or in
165040	170160	the observation of behavior, all they have is this overall impression, oh, that person is strange.
170160	175600	That person is different, they're unusual, they're awkward, but they can't when pressed to say,
175600	180320	what is it that makes them strange? Many people, because they're not trained in communication,
180320	185760	can't pinpoint exactly what it is about their behavior. But it's my belief that it is specific
185840	190880	behaviors. That's all that people can see. When people see you as abnormal or unusual or awkward
190880	195600	or whatever, all they have to go on is your behavior and then their inferences about you
195600	200960	based on that behavior. But I think it's specific observable behaviors that can be learned and
200960	206720	changed that are at the root of these perceptions that you are weird or awkward. And so here they are.
206720	213280	Number one, too much or too little eye contact. There are norms about eye contact and you cannot
213280	218800	make too much eye contact or else you seem like some sort of stalker or some sort of crazed lunatic
218800	223920	if you just bear down on people and look them in the eye too much, you're going to seem unusual,
223920	229280	weird or awkward. So too much eye contact is overbearing and uncomfortable and will make people
229280	233760	think you are violating these norms and they'll make the inference then you're weird or you're
233760	238080	socially awkward. Don't make too much eye contact when you're talking sexually normal to look away
238080	243120	for a while and then return your gaze to the person when you're done talking. It's not a staring
243120	249120	contest. Be sure to blink, be sure to look away, be sure to look down. Similarly, not enough eye
249120	254320	contact is also going to be perceived as weird or unusual. If you never make eye contact, you're
254320	260320	going to be perceived as really shy or withdrawn or not interested. The eyes are the window to the
260320	265520	soul. The face is the center of where most communication takes place in face to face ordinary
265520	270160	interaction. So you've got to make some eye contact when especially when you're listening,
270160	273760	it's more normal to make more eye contact. Even though the other person is looking away, you
273760	278160	should make eye contact. So when they look back at you, you're looking at them and they know that
278160	283120	you're listening. So make sufficient eye contact but not too much. Maybe that rule is hard to learn
283120	287440	and if you're awkward, you're thinking, I don't know how much too much is. I don't know how much
287440	292160	not enough is. This is why you're going to need coaching or you're able to have to study people
292160	299200	who are socially skilled and see how they make eye contact. Point number two, not enough or too much
299760	304960	interpersonal space or distance. And I think normally the issue will be not enough space,
304960	309120	but sometimes it could be too much. This is really closely related to eye contact. There's about a
309120	314720	12 to 16 inch, 12 to 18 inch in America. This differs from country to country. But in America,
314720	319920	there's like about a 12 to 18 inch personal space bubble that should not be violated unless you're
319920	325680	on sort of intimate friendly terms with a person. But in in ordinary social contact in public,
325680	331280	you have to respect this 12 to 18 inch personal distance bubble. If you're a close talker, right,
331280	335120	who talked about that Seinfeld or somebody like that, you don't want to be one of those close
335120	339040	talkers. You're going to be perceived as awkward, weird, and so on. People are going to make inferences
339040	343280	about you and your social skills. Even if you're a lovely human being, you must respect this personal
343280	349200	space bubble. Now this will vary from culture to culture. Norms of social distance are culture
349200	354320	specific, but in America, it's about 12 to 18 inches. So keep your distance. If you enter into
354400	358720	that distance, then people will feel violated that you're violating their personal space.
358720	363040	If you stay three feet away when you're talking to someone, they're going to think you're weird
363040	368160	because that's too far away to be standing for an ordinary conversation unless you're in a group
368160	374880	when the norms are for slightly greater distances and higher volumes and so on. So again, study what
374880	379280	you see in socially skilled people, make those judgments and copy those social distances too
379280	385360	much or too little distance will make you seem weird. Number three, poor oral hygiene or poor
385360	390800	general hygiene. There's no way to say it. Maybe you smell, maybe your breath is really bad,
390800	396000	maybe your body odor is really bad. And here again, there are culturally specific norms.
396000	401520	In America, there are these norms about showering every day that the smell of the human body in
401520	406560	America is taboo. You shouldn't smell. Your breath shouldn't smell. Your body shouldn't smell. You
406560	411200	should shower once a day and have all sorts of perfumy soap and deodorant and stuff like that on.
411200	415200	In other parts of the world, the normal smells of the human body are more acceptable and the
415200	419360	norms about breath or body odor are different. If you've traveled around the world, you'll realize
419360	423520	this because the people smell differently in different parts of the world. But in America,
423520	427920	if you don't brush your teeth, if you don't use mouthwash and you come close to people that can
427920	432720	smell your breath and it's really bad, they are going to think you're unclean. And they may then
432720	437200	make other inferences about you being a strange, isolated person that they don't want to interact
437200	443600	with. So in America, you can't have obvious body odor. You can't have a halitosis, bad breath.
443600	447920	You've got to brush your teeth, use mouthwash, chew gum, use breath mints, and you've got to
447920	452800	clean yourself. You can't have a perspiration that really smells or any other kind of body odor,
452800	456880	or the strong odor of food. It may not be fair, it may not be realistic, it varies from culture
456880	460880	to culture, but these are the norms in America. And if you violate them, you're going to be seen
460880	468400	as weird. Number four, lack of a filter. You say taboo things. That is, you use profanity when you
468400	473280	shouldn't. You talk about religion or politics in ways which offend people. You have no filter.
473280	478320	You say exactly what you think without regard to politeness or appropriateness to the situation,
478320	483600	or decorum, or respect, or poise, or dignity. You lack those things. You have no filter. You just
483600	490560	say whatever's on your mind without regard to relevance or appropriateness. And if you act
490560	494880	that way without any filter, people are going to think you're weird. The norms of human behavior,
494880	501840	the norms of human communication dictate that you avoid certain taboo topics, that you don't try to
501840	505600	raise too much controversy, that you don't shame people and embarrass them, and so on. So you have
505600	510240	to learn rules of appropriateness. So if I say be appropriate, you might say, but I'm weird,
510240	514560	I'm socially awkward, I don't know what appropriateness is. There are some rules that you can learn.
514560	519760	And I already mentioned a couple. You normally don't bring up religion and politics and sex
520720	527120	body parts, body odors, stuff like that, that's going to be really divisive in polite company,
527760	530800	or else you're going to be perceived as not understanding the norms of behavior. And anyone
530800	534080	who violates those norms will be seen as someone who's not safe to interact with,
534080	541600	otherwise known as weird or awkward. Number six, you don't cooperate in face work. So I have a whole,
541600	545920	a couple of other videos on Irving Goff and the expressive order and face work and so on going
545920	550240	all the way back to my very first video. So face is the positive social value we claim for
550240	555040	ourselves. It's dignity, pride, self-esteem, the fact that I am somebody who deserves respect.
555040	562320	So in ordinary interaction, you have a commitment not to embarrass yourself and not to allow other
562320	567200	people to be embarrassed, either to embarrass themselves or be embarrassed by you. So often
567200	572720	people who are perceived as weird or socially awkward don't know how to do face work. They're
572720	576560	not familiar. They don't know how to maintain the expressive order. And I'll link to my video about
576560	582160	the expressive order and what that is. They allow, they embarrass themselves by acting in strange
582160	587680	ways, which are violating norms. It's not okay to violate these social norms if you want to be seen
587680	593840	as normal. Or they allow other people to be embarrassed and they don't help repair embarrassment.
593840	598480	If other people are not confident that if they slip up that you'll help them avoid embarrassment,
598480	603120	you won't be seen as safe to interact with. And they'll see you as weird and abnormal. So if you
603120	608480	don't cooperate in face work, helping other people save face and not allowing yourself to lose face,
608480	614240	people might see you as weird or awkward. Number seven, too much or too little self-disclosure.
614240	619680	So self-disclosure, I wrote an email about this to my mailing list. I should post it on the website,
619680	625440	but I haven't. But I haven't made a video about this yet. Self-disclosure is the process of telling
625440	631360	people about ourselves, minor superficial details and then deep personal details about ourselves.
631360	635840	And generally, there's a progression. People who we hardly know, we tell them superficial
635840	640080	things about ourselves, like our name, what city we live in, what we do for a living,
640080	644960	maybe what some of our superficial interests are. And then as the relationship gets more intimate,
644960	649840	we reveal and disclose more intimate details about ourselves. That's the general progression
649840	655600	of self-disclosure. There are norms of self-disclosure. And if you violate them, you will be seen as
655600	661040	abnormal or awkward or weird. In the beginning of a relationship, do not disclose too much.
661040	664640	Your name, rank and serial number is about it, right? Your name, where you live,
664640	670160	what you do for a living, what maybe some of your hobbies are, if they're not taboo topics, you know.
670160	675840	Maybe what music or television or movies that you like or books, these are all safe topics.
675840	679680	And things that you could disclose about yourself early in a relationship where you're just meeting
679680	684640	new people. These are safe things to disclose. So don't disclose too much. If you meet new people
684640	689280	and suddenly start telling them about your deep psychological problems, about your addictions,
689280	694000	about your abuse history, about your mental health problems, about the most embarrassing and
694000	698480	shameful things about yourself or your life history, those things are all valid. Those experiences
698480	702800	are all valid. And eventually you want a friend that you can share them with, but not when you
702800	707760	first meet someone. It's not appropriate. People will be like, ah, too much information. This person
707760	712560	is weird and awkward. I don't want to interact with him. Similarly, if you never reveal anything
712560	717920	about yourself, people will not trust you. I used to know somebody. This person is not really part
717920	722000	of my life anymore, but I used to know somebody and she was a very good listener. So people would
722000	727520	tell her things, but she would never reveal anything about herself. So ultimately people didn't
727520	732400	trust her because if you never reveal anything about yourself, you're violating this norm of
732400	737200	self-disclosure, which says if I tell you something, then you tell me something of sort of equal
737200	742080	intimacy. You meet a new person and they tell you their name and where they live and kind of what
742080	745920	their hobbies are and what they do for a living. And then you reveal none of that information
745920	750880	about yourself. You violated this norm of reciprocity and self-disclosure and you're going
750880	757920	to be seen as weird. Number eight, you lack a sense of relevance. So one of the norms in conversation
757920	765280	is be relevant. You have to contribute to the conversation in such a way as that your contribution
765280	772160	is relevant to the previous conversation. That is, there's a specific topic being talked about
772160	776560	and the person who had the last turn at talk is talking about a specific topic and then it's
776560	782000	your turn to talk. You are obliged more or less to talk about the same topic or at least to say
782000	789200	something that is related to, relevant to the same topic. If you're perceived generally as awkward
789200	794320	or weird, you may have difficulty knowing what's relevant. So just stick to the same topic. Don't
794320	800640	try to change the subject too much. Extremely abrupt changes of subject will seem really strange.
800640	805840	If you deviate from the topic or say these non sequiturs, a non sequiturs of Latin for you
805840	811440	are not in the proper sequence out of place and a non sequiturs just to mention something on one
811440	816320	topic which totally is unrelated to the previous topic that was on the floor or being discussed
816320	821440	in the conversation. So if you are perceived as weird, it might be because you have not mastered
821440	827440	the sense of relevance. You must stay on topic. Number nine, you don't know how to gracefully
828000	834480	enter or leave an interaction. So there are norms around and rituals around entering and
834480	843200	leaving interactions. And if you enter or leave too abruptly or if you enter or leave too slowly,
843200	847920	sort of hard to know what it means to enter too slowly, but you can certainly leave too slowly
847920	853840	if someone is trying to end the conversation, they're going, all right, okay, great to meet you.
854320	859840	Wow, it's really a pleasure to have met you. I've got to get going. Okay, all right,
860480	865440	all right then. Okay, and you're still not leaving. Those are all cues for you to leave.
865440	869760	If you're missing all those cues and you linger and keep talking and won't let a person go when
869760	873840	they give you signals to go, they'll think you're weird or awkward and they won't want to interact
873840	878480	with you. So you've got to let people take their leave. Even if you want to keep talking with them,
878480	881920	when they signal that they're ready to leave, you have to let them leave. And when you enter
881920	887360	into a conversation, you can't just barge in if other people are talking, you have to enter in
887360	891840	slowly and appropriately. And if you're invited in to a conversation, because someone mentions your
891840	896080	name or they motion you over, you don't accept that invitation, you're going to be seen as awkward.
896080	900880	So entering and leaving are rituals, you have to master those rituals, or else you're going to be
900880	907120	seen as awkward or weird. Number 10, you don't use back channel cues. And so people never know
907120	914480	whether you're listening. A back channel cue is just something like, uh-huh. Oh, tell me more.
914480	919360	These are back channel cues, the little things that we do to let people know that we're still
919360	924400	listening. They give people cues that, yes, I'm still listening. I'm still here. They're important
924400	927760	on the telephone and they're important in face-to-face interaction. If you just sit there,
927760	930880	you think listening is about being silent and someone's talking and you're just...
931280	936800	They're going to think you're awkward or weird. You might be listening really
936800	942800	intently. You might be waiting for your chance to talk. But listening is actually an active thing
942800	949600	that you have to contribute. Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's interesting. Tell me more. Stuff like
949600	953440	that, that lets people know you're listening. So if you don't give back channel cues, people are
953440	957280	going to think you're not listening or you're not paying attention or you're just kind of weird.
957280	964400	And number 11, I don't have enough fingers for, number 11, you lack empathy. If people see you
964400	968880	as weird or awkward, it's possible that you lack empathy. Now, I have an entire playlist about
968880	972720	empathy, which you should check out because it's too big a topic for me to talk about in this video.
973360	979440	But it may be that you lack empathy. What that means is you may lack the ability to recognize
979440	984720	other people's feelings or to accurately identify other people's feelings or to relate them to
984720	989360	your own experience or to understand other people's perspectives, their plans, their goals,
989360	995520	their intentions, and their beliefs. Uh, you may lack the ability to say, to acknowledge people's
995520	1000320	feelings. You may not have enough altruism or compassion when people are hurting that you
1000320	1004960	reach out and do and say kind things in order to help relieve their suffering. All of these are
1004960	1009920	elements of empathy. And if people perceive you a lot of the time as weird or awkward,
1009920	1015760	you may not have mastered empathic listening and empathic skills, which have to do with
1016320	1020560	feeling other people's feelings, identifying other people's feelings correctly, naming them,
1021120	1025280	asking people to elaborate on them, and then saying comforting things to them. As I said,
1025280	1028800	lots and lots of other videos, this whole channel is kind of an empathy channel. So there's lots
1028800	1035440	to learn if those are your skills. So there you have it. 11 specific behaviors that if you're
1035440	1040800	not adhering to the norms of behavior in these 11 domains, it's quite likely others will perceive
1040800	1046800	you as abnormal, weird, or awkward. The good news is all of these are learnable skills,
1046800	1052320	even if you might be on the autism spectrum or have Asperger's or other challenges in your life
1052320	1056640	that make it difficult for you to perceive social nuances, or maybe you just grew up in a family
1056640	1060800	where you didn't get this kind of training and you're just in a situation where you have a lot
1060800	1066320	more to learn. That's what this channel is for. And I really, really want to help. So I think that
1066320	1070480	the previous videos I've made on conversation skills and empathy and listening are targeted
1070480	1076560	a lot of these deficits. If you're struggling with this idea that you're weird or socially awkward,
1076560	1081760	it is because of these specific observable behaviors that you are capable of changing,
1081760	1086720	not without effort. And you may never be able to be as smooth as the most socially skilled person.
1086720	1090800	But I think you can greatly decrease the perception that you're weird or awkward
1091360	1097280	by working on these specific learnable social skills. I'll say one more thing about being
1097280	1104000	weird before I sign off. It's totally okay to have unusual ideas, unusual beliefs. One of the
1104000	1108400	platitudes that people say to people who are feel themselves to be socially awkward or weird is,
1108400	1112240	Oh, I like weird people. It's okay to be weird. I think what they're saying there is it's okay
1112240	1116800	to be quirky. It's okay to be unusual. It's okay to have slightly different beliefs.
1116800	1121760	But when we go, there are norms of human behavior, including norms for what attitudes and beliefs
1121760	1126960	we can hold in a given culture in a given time in history. If you go too far outside those norms,
1126960	1132800	you will pay the price as someone who's a non conformist and socially outcast and so on. So
1132800	1136720	you have to do that calculation on your own. If you have very, very, if you have beliefs that
1136720	1141760	are very far outside the norm or behaviors that are very far outside the norm, one of the prices
1141760	1146080	socially you might pay for that is a certain amount of ostracism or being isolated or perceived
1146080	1150720	as weird or awkward. But if you have normal beliefs and attitudes, which are within the
1150720	1156160	norms for our time and place in history, but that you just haven't mastered all these communication
1156160	1160640	skills, I think there's really a route for you to be seen as as much more normal than you might
