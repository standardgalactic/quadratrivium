0	9720	Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrr
9720	13680	Ooh.
13680	20320	Aaah.
20320	47760	The
47760	55280	universe as far as we know is all there is. Physics provides no real way for us to ever
55280	61040	look anywhere but within it. We are cocooned from any possible communication from other
61040	67600	dimensions or alternate realities. Other dimensions may exist and there may even be
67600	74000	a boundary to the cosmos, but so far we've never observed anything remotely resembling
74000	88960	one. On very large scales, the universe is actually a pretty simple place. It has been
88960	94240	around for a finite amount of time, roughly 13 and a half billion years. It looks pretty
94240	100240	much the same everywhere. Galaxies are almost evenly distributed across the cosmos. Everywhere
100320	107600	we look, we see about the same number of galaxies. It is also big, very, very big,
108320	114560	and it's getting bigger. The spacetime between all 100 billion galaxies in the universe is increasing.
116240	122160	Like a roiling, seething froth, new, empty spacetime is being created as the universe ages,
122880	126480	increasing the distances between the galaxies, pushing them apart.
126800	135120	Since the universe is expanding, it is a natural question to ask, what is it expanding into?
137280	143120	When we peer deep into the cosmos, we cannot see a boundary. So far, we have uncovered no
143120	149040	evidence that a boundary exists. Space may extend to infinity, or it may not. But in
149040	154400	Einstein's universe, things can be curved, and if things can be curved, they can be curved in on
154400	159680	themselves, twisting and bending the shape of the universe into virtually anything imaginable.
160720	166000	General relativity makes it possible to live in an infinite universe with no boundary at all.
170560	176480	Because of general relativity, spacetime is not a static entity. It is a dynamic and
176480	180560	ever-changing fabric within which the locations of all galaxies are woven.
181520	187280	Galaxies are not themselves moving very much, but they appear to move to us because of new,
187280	191680	cosmic real estate continually injected, increasing their distance from us.
193200	198000	It is this creation of new spacetime, and the rate at which it is being created,
198000	201760	which determines how fast a galaxy appears to be moving away from us.
202560	214400	So what is the universe expanding into? When new spacetime is created,
214400	220880	into what do the edges go? The answer depends on whether or not there are edges.
223440	226960	If we live in an infinite universe, then the answer has to be nothing.
227920	231360	Adding more fabric to infinity doesn't make more infinity.
232480	236720	An infinite universe would have no edges that expand, and the question is meaningless.
237840	240880	In such a universe, there would be no outside.
243200	248400	On the other hand, if the universe is finite, with a boundary that we have not yet discovered,
248400	251040	then the answer may be that we are expanding into something.
252080	256640	If that is true, however, then the boundary is so far away that we cannot see it,
256640	262560	and it can therefore never, ever affect us. We have already seen photons that have been
262560	268240	traveling since the universe was only 500 million years old. Anything much further away
268240	274640	lies beyond our detection forever. Given that the universe is expanding, if we cannot see the
274640	281760	boundary now, this expansion guarantees we never will. It will forevermore get further and further
281760	285440	away, and it will always lie beyond our detection.
293040	297840	Only 100 years ago, we had no idea there were other galaxies besides our own.
298800	302480	It was thought that humanity and the galaxy we inhabit was an island,
302480	308720	adrift in a universe of 100 billion stars. We now know that our universe is a vast,
308720	315600	dynamic cauldron of activity, home to 100 billion galaxies, all racing away within a
315600	321120	boiling ocean of space-time. While we may yet find our universe as just an island,
321760	325680	we have yet discovered it is much larger than we ever thought.
