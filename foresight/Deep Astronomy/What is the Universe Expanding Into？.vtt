00:00.000 --> 00:09.720
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrr

00:09.720 --> 00:13.680
Ooh.

00:13.680 --> 00:20.320
Aaah.

00:20.320 --> 00:47.760
The

00:47.760 --> 00:55.280
universe as far as we know is all there is. Physics provides no real way for us to ever

00:55.280 --> 01:01.040
look anywhere but within it. We are cocooned from any possible communication from other

01:01.040 --> 01:07.600
dimensions or alternate realities. Other dimensions may exist and there may even be

01:07.600 --> 01:14.000
a boundary to the cosmos, but so far we've never observed anything remotely resembling

01:14.000 --> 01:28.960
one. On very large scales, the universe is actually a pretty simple place. It has been

01:28.960 --> 01:34.240
around for a finite amount of time, roughly 13 and a half billion years. It looks pretty

01:34.240 --> 01:40.240
much the same everywhere. Galaxies are almost evenly distributed across the cosmos. Everywhere

01:40.320 --> 01:47.600
we look, we see about the same number of galaxies. It is also big, very, very big,

01:48.320 --> 01:54.560
and it's getting bigger. The spacetime between all 100 billion galaxies in the universe is increasing.

01:56.240 --> 02:02.160
Like a roiling, seething froth, new, empty spacetime is being created as the universe ages,

02:02.880 --> 02:06.480
increasing the distances between the galaxies, pushing them apart.

02:06.800 --> 02:15.120
Since the universe is expanding, it is a natural question to ask, what is it expanding into?

02:17.280 --> 02:23.120
When we peer deep into the cosmos, we cannot see a boundary. So far, we have uncovered no

02:23.120 --> 02:29.040
evidence that a boundary exists. Space may extend to infinity, or it may not. But in

02:29.040 --> 02:34.400
Einstein's universe, things can be curved, and if things can be curved, they can be curved in on

02:34.400 --> 02:39.680
themselves, twisting and bending the shape of the universe into virtually anything imaginable.

02:40.720 --> 02:46.000
General relativity makes it possible to live in an infinite universe with no boundary at all.

02:50.560 --> 02:56.480
Because of general relativity, spacetime is not a static entity. It is a dynamic and

02:56.480 --> 03:00.560
ever-changing fabric within which the locations of all galaxies are woven.

03:01.520 --> 03:07.280
Galaxies are not themselves moving very much, but they appear to move to us because of new,

03:07.280 --> 03:11.680
cosmic real estate continually injected, increasing their distance from us.

03:13.200 --> 03:18.000
It is this creation of new spacetime, and the rate at which it is being created,

03:18.000 --> 03:21.760
which determines how fast a galaxy appears to be moving away from us.

03:22.560 --> 03:34.400
So what is the universe expanding into? When new spacetime is created,

03:34.400 --> 03:40.880
into what do the edges go? The answer depends on whether or not there are edges.

03:43.440 --> 03:46.960
If we live in an infinite universe, then the answer has to be nothing.

03:47.920 --> 03:51.360
Adding more fabric to infinity doesn't make more infinity.

03:52.480 --> 03:56.720
An infinite universe would have no edges that expand, and the question is meaningless.

03:57.840 --> 04:00.880
In such a universe, there would be no outside.

04:03.200 --> 04:08.400
On the other hand, if the universe is finite, with a boundary that we have not yet discovered,

04:08.400 --> 04:11.040
then the answer may be that we are expanding into something.

04:12.080 --> 04:16.640
If that is true, however, then the boundary is so far away that we cannot see it,

04:16.640 --> 04:22.560
and it can therefore never, ever affect us. We have already seen photons that have been

04:22.560 --> 04:28.240
traveling since the universe was only 500 million years old. Anything much further away

04:28.240 --> 04:34.640
lies beyond our detection forever. Given that the universe is expanding, if we cannot see the

04:34.640 --> 04:41.760
boundary now, this expansion guarantees we never will. It will forevermore get further and further

04:41.760 --> 04:45.440
away, and it will always lie beyond our detection.

04:53.040 --> 04:57.840
Only 100 years ago, we had no idea there were other galaxies besides our own.

04:58.800 --> 05:02.480
It was thought that humanity and the galaxy we inhabit was an island,

05:02.480 --> 05:08.720
adrift in a universe of 100 billion stars. We now know that our universe is a vast,

05:08.720 --> 05:15.600
dynamic cauldron of activity, home to 100 billion galaxies, all racing away within a

05:15.600 --> 05:21.120
boiling ocean of space-time. While we may yet find our universe as just an island,

05:21.760 --> 05:25.680
we have yet discovered it is much larger than we ever thought.
