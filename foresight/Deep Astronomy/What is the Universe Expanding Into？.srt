1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,720
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrr

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,680
Ooh.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:20,320
Aaah.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:47,760
The

5
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,280
universe as far as we know is all there is. Physics provides no real way for us to ever

6
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,040
look anywhere but within it. We are cocooned from any possible communication from other

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,600
dimensions or alternate realities. Other dimensions may exist and there may even be

8
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:14,000
a boundary to the cosmos, but so far we've never observed anything remotely resembling

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:28,960
one. On very large scales, the universe is actually a pretty simple place. It has been

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,240
around for a finite amount of time, roughly 13 and a half billion years. It looks pretty

11
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,240
much the same everywhere. Galaxies are almost evenly distributed across the cosmos. Everywhere

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,600
we look, we see about the same number of galaxies. It is also big, very, very big,

13
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,560
and it's getting bigger. The spacetime between all 100 billion galaxies in the universe is increasing.

14
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,160
Like a roiling, seething froth, new, empty spacetime is being created as the universe ages,

15
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,480
increasing the distances between the galaxies, pushing them apart.

16
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:15,120
Since the universe is expanding, it is a natural question to ask, what is it expanding into?

17
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,120
When we peer deep into the cosmos, we cannot see a boundary. So far, we have uncovered no

18
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,040
evidence that a boundary exists. Space may extend to infinity, or it may not. But in

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,400
Einstein's universe, things can be curved, and if things can be curved, they can be curved in on

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,680
themselves, twisting and bending the shape of the universe into virtually anything imaginable.

21
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,000
General relativity makes it possible to live in an infinite universe with no boundary at all.

22
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,480
Because of general relativity, spacetime is not a static entity. It is a dynamic and

23
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,560
ever-changing fabric within which the locations of all galaxies are woven.

24
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,280
Galaxies are not themselves moving very much, but they appear to move to us because of new,

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,680
cosmic real estate continually injected, increasing their distance from us.

26
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,000
It is this creation of new spacetime, and the rate at which it is being created,

27
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
which determines how fast a galaxy appears to be moving away from us.

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:34,400
So what is the universe expanding into? When new spacetime is created,

29
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,880
into what do the edges go? The answer depends on whether or not there are edges.

30
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,960
If we live in an infinite universe, then the answer has to be nothing.

31
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,360
Adding more fabric to infinity doesn't make more infinity.

32
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
An infinite universe would have no edges that expand, and the question is meaningless.

33
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,880
In such a universe, there would be no outside.

34
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,400
On the other hand, if the universe is finite, with a boundary that we have not yet discovered,

35
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
then the answer may be that we are expanding into something.

36
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,640
If that is true, however, then the boundary is so far away that we cannot see it,

37
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:22,560
and it can therefore never, ever affect us. We have already seen photons that have been

38
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,240
traveling since the universe was only 500 million years old. Anything much further away

39
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,640
lies beyond our detection forever. Given that the universe is expanding, if we cannot see the

40
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:41,760
boundary now, this expansion guarantees we never will. It will forevermore get further and further

41
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,440
away, and it will always lie beyond our detection.

42
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,840
Only 100 years ago, we had no idea there were other galaxies besides our own.

43
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,480
It was thought that humanity and the galaxy we inhabit was an island,

44
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,720
adrift in a universe of 100 billion stars. We now know that our universe is a vast,

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,600
dynamic cauldron of activity, home to 100 billion galaxies, all racing away within a

46
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,120
boiling ocean of space-time. While we may yet find our universe as just an island,

47
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,680
we have yet discovered it is much larger than we ever thought.
