0	16320	Welcome to this lecture on aspects of western philosophy module 24 and also lecture number
16320	24120	24. This lecture is going to be on the philosophy of one of the very important thinkers of
24120	33560	western philosophy Hegel. And we would focus on the following topics in this lecture.
33560	40400	We will first of all see the concept of Geist or spirit, mind, it is translated in various
40400	46720	ways. Then we will concentrate on this method of dialectics or rather we would conclude
46720	52560	this lecture with that in between we will discuss the concepts of being, non-being and
52560	57680	becoming. They are all interconnected notions in Hegelian philosophy.
57680	63640	Well, when we talk about the importance of a philosopher in the history of philosophy,
63640	70160	normally we consider two criteria. Number one, the contributions he or she had made
70160	77040	to the history of philosophy and number two, the contemporary relevance of these thinkers.
77040	81440	So, in that sense we can see that you know many of these traditional or even ancient
81440	87800	philosophers like Plato and Aristotle are still very important, because even today their
87800	93880	thoughts inspire us, inspire philosophers. But when you try to understand, when you try
93880	101040	to evaluate Hegel in the light of these criteria, I would rather say that both of them, I mean
101040	106680	if you consider both the aspects like the contributions to the history of philosophy,
106720	113480	history of thought and history of human intellectual history, we can put it in that way, the entire
113480	120400	human intellectual history owe a lot to Hegelian philosophy. Hegel has inspired thinkers from
120400	126840	all aspects, all intellectual disciplines and of course, the contemporary relevance
126840	130440	of Hegel. There are many philosophers in the contemporary
130440	140200	world, go back to Hegel's thought, notable philosopher Charles Taylor and many others
140200	145240	and as far as Indian philosophical tradition is concerned, there is a tendency among some
145240	151560	Indian philosophers to compare the Hegelian system of absolute idealism with Vedanta.
151560	158360	So, in that sense Hegel is a very important thinker for us and we will start with concept
158360	165760	of gist or absolute or spirit, but before that let us see some basic details about Hegel.
165760	174480	He was born on August 27th, 1770 and his association with Friedrich Halderin, a very
174480	181680	important poet, German poet and Schelling led him to read and spend more time on the
181680	188280	critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant. So, this association with these two great thinkers
188280	195880	played a very important role in Hegel's philosophy and in Hegel's intellectual development.
195880	202200	Then he published his first major philosophical work, the phenomenology of spirit in 1807.
202200	206040	There are many other works he published during his lifetime, I am not going to mention about
206040	213760	all of them, but the attempt is to understand how a philosopher such a great thinker like
213760	219160	Hegel has actually started his philosophical career and probably in the next lecture we
219160	223560	will concentrate on this whole idea of phenomenology of spirit.
223560	229400	When we talk about the philosophical sources of Hegel, the French rationalism of course
229400	235000	is played a very important role and then comes the British imperialism like all thinkers
235000	240880	of modern enlightenment philosophy or post enlightenment thought. Hegel was also influenced
240880	248320	by the two great traditions of rationalism and empiricism and also Kant, Kant's transcendental
248320	254520	philosophy. Kant being a German, it was quite natural that Kant would have influenced Hegelian
254520	259160	philosophy, Hegel's intellectual growth in a significant manner.
259160	264120	But another very interesting influence on Hegelian philosophy is Romanticism which is
264120	268920	a little condensious, but at the same time we can see that you know Hegel's attempt
268960	274680	to totalize everything or to develop a philosophy, a totalizing theoretical framework owes a
274680	281800	lot to Romantic approach or Romanticism. And another important contribution probably
281800	288280	or influence of Romanticism is visible in Hegel's attempt to spiritualize philosophy
288280	293320	which is little against the kind of prevailing systems or prevailing approaches to philosophy
293320	300440	in the Enlightenment age, because Enlightenment always try to see nature as material, but
300440	303760	we can see that Hegel was trying to spiritualize it.
303760	310920	So we can see in Hegel's philosophy all these trends the rationalism, empiricism, transcendentalism
310920	317560	or critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, then Romanticism all these you know intellectual
317560	324120	developments converge in a unique manner in Hegelian system of thought.
324120	329800	Now when we talk about Hegel's task as a philosopher, he was trying to formulate a
329800	336760	philosophical theory that will reach to infinity. This again a very interesting aspect, because
336760	343960	when you talk about infinity particularly in the backdrop of Enlightenment philosophy,
343960	349280	the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, we have already examined in detail that when
349280	358160	Kant discussed the critic of pure reason, he drew a very clear line, he said that it
358160	364320	is impossible to think this side of the line, you can be here, but never try to stretch
364320	372000	it and try to apply the categories of human thinking or rational categories to your understanding
372000	377880	of God or infinite reality or anything. So in that sense, Enlightenment philosophy
377880	384240	drew a very clear line between finite and infinity, something which is finite, something
384240	389440	which human beings with their finite minds can understand and there is an infinite reality
389440	397000	which we can never probably comprehend. So this line is something which Hegel was trying
397000	405360	to cross. Then again formulated totalizing philosophy that comprehends all reality, when
405360	410680	you talk about all reality, I mean it includes all aspects of reality, all phases of reality
410680	417800	not just one. For instance, for Enlightenment reality is constitutive of the material domain,
417800	424200	rather ultimate real is something which is unknowable according to Kantian philosophy
424720	431040	and the phenomenal reality is something which is confined to the domains of percepts and
431040	438880	concepts. So it is basically talks about scientific understanding, but for Hegel history is equally
438880	445760	important like physics. So in one sense we can say that Hegel is historicizing philosophy
445760	451160	or rather is a historian of philosophy, he is definitely not the first historian of philosophy
451280	457800	or first philosopher of history, but Hegel's contributions in this domain, this area is
457800	463680	phenomenal. So in that sense we have to understand this particular standpoint that trying to
463680	469680	develop formulate a totalizing philosophy that comprehends all reality, the historical,
469680	476200	psychological, creative, philosophical, scientific, physical, all aspects of reality into one
476200	483600	system. A philosophy that accounts for all human experience, the totalizing philosophy
483600	491280	that incorporates all knowledge and wisdom, present in science, history, religion, politics,
491280	497280	art and literature are all synthesized in the unique manner in Hegelian system. So in
497280	502080	that sense there are some philosophers, some historians of philosophy would say that Hegel
502080	509080	was the most perfect philosopher, because everything converges into Hegelian system
509080	514280	and the influence of romanticism is quite visible as far as this aspect is concerned.
514280	520280	We will have a brief look at what romanticism is to understand to appreciate Hegelian philosophy
520280	526760	in a more comprehensive manner. It is a new moment in the realms of literature, philosophy
526760	532680	and arts. There are romantic poets, romantic artists who adopted a kind of very unique
532680	537440	and very different approach to nature, the relationship between man and nature, the
537440	542080	importance they have given to experiencing nature, the importance they have given to
542080	548120	emotions. Say for example, people like Wordsworth, the importance given to emotions, passions,
548120	553000	the passionate and experiential way in which you relate yourself with nature, all these
553000	560080	things were emphasized by the romantic thinkers and artists. They advocated by artists and
560080	565720	intellectuals who rejected the enlightenment philosophy dominated by reason, logic and
565720	571760	mathematics. As we have already seen, enlightenment philosophy was dominated by these aspects
571760	578760	reason, logic. For instance, we have seen it in Immanuel Kant, used literature to express
578760	583880	the inner world of human feelings. So, that is what I meant, the world of feelings, emotions
583880	590520	and passions were highlighted by these thinkers. They protest against the domination of science
590520	596280	in culture, highlighted the inability of science in exhausting the complexities of human
596280	602040	experience. Now, for instance, how do you experience a flower? The beauty of a flower,
602040	608480	it is more than just having the perceives and concepts as Kant has mentioned about it.
608480	614400	There is something more than that, you know, you experience is that part of an environment
614400	620440	or being part of that experience, all these things are emphasized by these romantic thinkers.
620440	626000	It misses the totality of experiences and the feelings associated with it and to understand
626000	631680	the world, not science, but experience as it is lived. So, there is a concept of lived
631680	638400	experiences which is emphasized by them and naturally their conception of reality is also
638400	643000	drastically different from the enlightenment conception, where reality is material as I
643000	649480	already mentioned, reality is spiritual. Nature is spiritualized by the romandist which
649480	655040	you can see a trend in Hegel also and nature is not like Newton's mechanical world, but
655040	661280	it is a living spirit which we will find in the conception of geist or spirit in Hegel.
661280	667520	The will is important and not reason, because for the enlightenment reason was the major
667520	672920	tool for understanding the world, but for these romandist it is the will which plays
672920	679560	an important role, which thus justice to the non-rational aspects of human life.
679560	684120	The idea of polarity, human thought and feeling are characterized by a polarity, there is
684120	689880	a two sidedness which again figures in Hegelian philosophy in the form of dialectics, in the
689880	695920	form of contradictions, we will see it later. And again in the pursuit of the infinite,
695920	700760	never get confined to one more of thought which is again Hegelian, Hegel absorbs these
700760	706840	insights, because for Hegel also the whole alone is true, truth is the whole not one
706840	713080	particular concept is only a partial truth, it can never represent the whole of truth,
713080	717840	the whole of truth cannot be represented by one concept of one more of thinking.
717840	724200	So, this is again Hegelian and never be static, with this understanding in the background
724280	728920	let us come to examine some of the important features of Hegelian philosophy.
728920	734840	An observation by Bertrand Russell says that Hegel's philosophy is very difficult, he
734840	740560	is I should say the hardest to understand of all great philosophers, probably that is
740560	747280	true to some extent to a philosopher like Bertrand Russell, who subscribes to the analytic
747280	752160	tradition of philosophy, he is more cance in that way, he is more mathematical in that
752200	757720	for example, Russell we would see later in the course of this lecture series, that would
757720	764040	be appreciating more a mathematical scientific approach to philosophy which Hegel is not
764040	767120	subscribing to.
767120	773000	Hegel's central thought is as I already mentioned only the whole is real, a totalizing
773000	780400	approach this is visible in the concept of the gist or spirit, being the central concept
780440	782480	which unifies everything.
782480	791480	So, Hegel was trying to formulate a concept which could successfully comprehend all aspects
791480	798240	of reality and unifies everything that can be understood and that concept is the concept
798240	801720	of gist or spirit.
801720	807880	All partial facts are abstractions, they have to be brought into connection with the hall
807880	809400	in order to gain validity.
809400	815720	So, this is again a very important Hegelian notion that taking things in isolation is
815720	825440	to abstract them, isolate them from the picture of reality, reality is constituted of the hall.
825440	831520	Reality is hall, the self-subsistence of finite things is an illusion, nothing can exist in
831520	835680	isolation everything is necessarily connected with the rest.
836080	841320	So, this is the essence of Hegelian philosophy in one sense and here Russell says once again
841320	848000	Hegel seeks to demonstrate nothing exists independently of relationships against separated
848000	852280	ness influence of mysticism is visible in this context.
852280	857440	This is according to Bertrand Russell, he interestingly says that here as far as this
857440	863560	aspect of Hegelian philosophy is concerned he is influenced by his early mystic affiliations
863560	870400	because Hegel started his career with I mean he joined a monastery and from there he learned
870400	872160	theology and philosophy.
872160	878120	So, this early affiliation with mysticism would have prompted him to conceive things
878120	880800	in this way this is Russell's opinion.
880800	887680	Now, let us come to Hegel's concept of reality as I mentioned here the stresses on the hall,
887680	895480	the complex system comparable to an organism against Spinoza for whom substance is a simple
895480	897760	or reality is a simple substance.
897760	905960	So, here on the one hand we can see that Hegel was also emphasizing like Spinoza did for
905960	912240	Spinoza also there is only one substance, one reality that is the substance and for
912240	919480	Hegel also there is a kind of I mean he too points to a notion of reality, a notion of
919480	924320	absolute spirit or mind which is universal.
924320	932520	But the difference is that here the reference is to a complex system which is comparable
932520	939680	to an organism as far as Hegelian system is concerned separate things are not an illusion
939680	944640	according to Hegel each has a greater or lesser degree of reality which is not the case with
944640	948480	Spinoza and many others those who are modest.
948480	955280	But for Hegel the separate things the individual things are not illusions and again the reality
955280	959120	of separate things consist in them being an aspect of the hall.
959120	964280	So, at the same time Hegel emphasizes on the importance of the hall.
964680	970640	So, the individual gains its meaning and its significance only in connection with its
970640	974600	being a meaningful part of the hall.
974600	975960	The hall is the absolute.
975960	980560	So, there are concepts these are some of the concepts very important concepts which Hegel
980560	987960	introduces in his philosophy the concept of absolute mind, spirit, geist and there are
987960	992600	several terms which Hegel uses in this context.
992600	998960	And again this reality for Hegel again it is very interesting to note this difference
998960	1006080	the difference between the conceptions of reality advocated by Hegel and how he has formulated
1006080	1010000	it as opposed to the enlightenment conception.
1010000	1015000	In enlightenment conception for example, the Kantian view of reality the phenomenal world
1015000	1020120	is a world of cause and effect though this is something which the mind attributes to
1020120	1021120	the world.
1021120	1026800	It is true we are the law givers according to Kant, but at the same time it is governed
1026800	1032720	by a cause effect relationship the phenomenal world is governed by a cause effect relationship
1032720	1040280	which to some extent Hegel also except, but he makes a major deviation here he says that
1040280	1043160	it is governed by the principle of teleological causality.
1043160	1049040	So, here he is very close to Aristotle, Aristotle also has a conception of teleology that everything
1049040	1055480	has a purpose a higher purpose to be realized and there are two principles which are relevant
1055480	1060280	in Aristotelian philosophy at potentiality and actuality.
1060280	1064720	And in the process of change according to Aristotle every change is evolution we have
1064720	1069120	already seen it in one of our previous lectures.
1069120	1073640	Since every change is in evolution in the process of evolution what happens is that
1073640	1080320	an object realizes materializes its potentialities or actualizes the potentialities.
1080320	1086200	So, here again something like that we can see that everything progresses towards what
1086200	1088200	the absolute according to Hegel.
1088200	1093480	So, governed by the principle of teleological causality and not just mechanical efficient
1093480	1095000	causality.
1095000	1102000	The meaning of each stage is realized in the hall which is the rational and again a revision
1102000	1108760	of the conception of rationality which is advocated by the modern philosophers by enlarge
1108760	1115120	and particularly the enlightenment thinkers like Kant to overcome Kantian separation of
1115120	1116520	Nomina and Phenomena.
1116520	1123520	Because if you approach reality with the Kantian model then it is impossible to know the Nomina
1123520	1128000	there is a clear separation as I already mentioned a line is drawn between Nomina and Phenomena
1128000	1132200	something which you can know and the reality which you can never know.
1132200	1138280	That is because Kant and the enlightenment philosophers advocated a very peculiar conception
1138280	1142400	of rationality by means of which reality is comprehended.
1142400	1148440	This rationality has two aspects I have already mentioned it in my previous lectures the
1148440	1153320	percepts and concepts with the interaction of these two reality the phenomenal world
1153320	1154320	is revealed.
1154320	1159440	But something which lies beyond that the nominal reality can never be known.
1159440	1168720	But Hegel was consciously making an attempt to overcome this dichotomy to know Nomina
1168720	1175060	and that is why the principle of teleological causality is important in Hegelian system its
1175060	1177960	identification spirit as activity.
1177960	1184960	So reality is being identified as a spiritual phenomena as an activity not as a static thing
1184960	1191080	but as an activity which comprehends everything even the comprehending mind even the mind
1191080	1194120	which understands it is also part of that.
1194120	1200080	So it encompasses everything the conception of reality and then again there we can see
1200080	1205280	Aristotle's influence where identification of the fully substantial being with spirit
1205400	1208160	which is in essence is activity.
1208160	1214660	So here also we can see that reality or the absolute or the spirit the absolute mind is
1214660	1222360	conceived as an activity as a process which progressively takes us to the reason to the
1222360	1225400	infinity.
1225400	1230080	Again things have meaning the process is rational there is a rational order.
1230080	1237320	So this is another important feature of Hegelian thought that he says that this process by
1237320	1243360	means of which reality exist reality itself is a process it is not a static entity but
1243360	1250080	it is a process a dynamic process but this process has a meaning it is teleological and
1250080	1255080	also it is a rational process it is a process of rational unfolding we can mentioned in
1255080	1256080	that way.
1256080	1263280	Hall is like an organism that is rational purposive and with full meaning.
1263280	1267920	Again the Kantian approach is not suitable to know it because the Kantian approach will
1267920	1274160	never accept this comprehensive perspective for Kant there is always a separation the
1274160	1279920	subject and object are different for Kant for Hegel the subject and object can never
1279920	1287200	be different both are comprehended or both are encompassed by the single reality called
1287200	1288200	the absolute.
1288200	1294840	Then again Kantian rationality is insufficient in knowing this process because Kantian
1294840	1299880	rationality employs the twelve categories of understanding which limits everything to
1299880	1305200	a certain structure which is provided by the mind transcendental a perception which is
1305200	1309280	not acceptable for Hegel.
1309280	1313640	Now let us come to the Kantian problem because we have been discussing about Kant and Kantian
1313640	1320560	model of rationality a lot let us see what happens here the ego the mind because we have
1320560	1327440	already seen that Kant was I mean it is being stated that Kant is initiating a kind of Copernican
1327440	1332880	revolution in philosophy and this Copernican revolution consists in placing the subject
1332880	1338120	the mind the ego at the center of the knowing activity as I have already mentioned in this
1338120	1343600	lecture sometime back that we are the low givers of the universe this is the Kantian
1343600	1344600	position.
1344600	1352400	Now what is this ego the low giver the ego or mind according to Kant is the condition
1352400	1356840	of the possibility of things appearing to the subject.
1356840	1361520	So this is the Kantian position it is a precondition that is why it is called transcendental critical
1361520	1368720	philosophy because it talks about the condition of the possibility of things appearing to
1368720	1375520	the subject and again ego is an abstract account of the forms of thought or categories of
1375520	1376520	understanding.
1376520	1382840	So Kantian ego can be understood in terms of this an abstract account of the forms of
1382840	1387520	thought or categories of understanding there are twelve categories of understanding according
1387520	1388520	to Kant.
1388520	1393400	Kantian ego can be equated with that the empirical ego can be equated with that and
1393400	1401440	again reason for in that framework is a faculty of the soul or ego constituted of a combination
1401440	1405520	of principles forms or rules according to which we think.
1405520	1411880	So these qualities quantity modality and relations these twelve categories would enable
1411880	1414520	us to think in a particular way.
1414520	1421420	So the world as such can never be known but we understand it by attributing certain principles
1421420	1428160	and laws from our side to it that is the Kantian peculiarity and mind is separated from the
1428160	1432400	world as I mentioned mind is the low giver of the world.
1432400	1437360	So it is not only epistemologically different from the world but is also ontologically
1437360	1440320	different from the world.
1440320	1449400	Forms of thought from what they are forms of mind from what they are forms of the world.
1449400	1455960	So Kantian philosophy introduces several such categories there is the mind the domain of
1455960	1462440	the ego the low giver the forms of thought then there is a world the phenomenal world
1462440	1467120	what we know and there is a nominal domain of reality which we will never know.
1467120	1473920	So these are all various aspects of Kantian philosophical systems and again the problem
1473920	1480280	is that there is a gap between mind and the world.
1480280	1488540	There is a gap between the mind and the world here which can be better articulated by separating
1488540	1490640	the phenomena with the nominal.
1490640	1496920	The nominal reality is constitutive of higher realities which can never be known and the
1496920	1502480	phenomenal reality is something which is spatio-temporally given to us which we experience.
1502480	1509880	So this gap between nominal and phenomena is actually the gap between mind and the world
1509880	1515280	and the problem of the nominal or things in themselves which can never be known.
1515280	1521480	Things in themselves can never be known again problem of antinomies which we have already
1521480	1528040	discussed when we try to apply these categories of understanding to the nominal world or entities
1528040	1532880	in the nominal world reality as such say for example when we try to understand the solve
1532880	1538280	about which we do not have percepts but we try to categorize it without having percepts
1538280	1544560	we are ultimately bound to end up with antinomies where you have certain contradictory statements
1544560	1550640	which apparently both of them seem to be equally valid.
1551520	1557600	Now Hegel's phenomenology of spirit attempts to give an alternate account of this relationship
1557600	1561680	and show how that this gap can be overcome.
1561680	1568400	So this is what ultimately tries to say phenomenology of the mind or phenomenology of spirit which
1568400	1574240	basically talks about the evolution of the human mind from through several stages to
1574240	1580280	the ultimate stage where it reaches the absolute or which where it realizes in the absolute.
1580280	1583880	So this process we will examine in detail in the next lecture.
1583880	1590320	So it is here with this work Hegel tries to overcome the distinction between nominal
1590320	1594280	and phenomenal realities.
1594280	1603000	And when we talk about Kantian philosophy Vizavi Hegelian thought Kant we had seen already
1603000	1609720	that was influenced by the physical sciences and thinking is confined to the scientific
1609720	1616800	level that is why he has this model of thinking which is constitutive of percepts and concepts.
1616800	1624600	Then again contradictions in thinking are inevitable at this level because you have you are limited
1624600	1630360	to the percepts and concepts and when you are trying to apply this to a world which
1630360	1637360	is apparently not limited or not confined to any of these constraints then you are bound
1637400	1641200	to end up in contradictions.
1641200	1645800	Hegel on the other hand adopts the approach of a historian this is what I mentioned earlier
1645800	1651120	that there is an approach of a historian historical approach in philosophy.
1651120	1657000	Thinking as an activity of spirit or reason and not confined to the scientific level and
1657000	1661280	he rises above contradictions to their synthesis.
1661280	1666600	So that we will see in the later part of this lecture the concept of synthesis which is
1666600	1671080	the culmination of dialectical process.
1671080	1675440	Now Hegel's view of reason we can see that reason is the law according to which being
1675440	1678800	is produced constituted and unfolding.
1678800	1683840	He has a very an extremely comprehensive concept of rationality or reason where it is a
1683840	1690560	law according to which being is produced the entire reality is not different from reason.
1690560	1693840	So rational and real are one and the same.
1693840	1699540	So later on Hegel would proclaim really is rational and rational is real.
1699540	1706040	It is constituted and unfolded in reason and both subjective faculty and objective reality
1706040	1708080	are constitutive of this reason.
1708080	1712680	See this is again a very important deviation from the enlightenment conception.
1712680	1717560	In the enlightenment conception we have seen that there is a subject and the object they
1717560	1723560	are different from each other and they are constitutive of different realities ontological
1724080	1726520	different epistemologically different.
1726520	1733240	But in Hegelian system both the subjective and the objective faculties are constituted
1733240	1734480	by reason.
1734480	1739640	See reason according to Hegel is a subjective faculty as the essence and norm of our thinking
1739640	1746800	or our thought the way in which we think what our thinking itself is and on the other side
1746800	1753280	it is an objective reality as the essence and law of the evolution of things.
1753280	1759200	We have seen this whole notion of categories of thinking when we have discussed tension
1759200	1765800	philosophy and Hegel also was interested in this idea of categories the categories of
1765800	1767240	human thinking.
1767240	1773600	But the major difference is that for Hegel these categories of thinking are not just
1773600	1778960	subjective elements of our thinking as Kant conceived it is it is not just subjective
1778960	1784440	elements but this categories of thinking are according to him the categories of reason
1784440	1791920	itself and reason according to him as I already mentioned encompasses comprehends everything
1791920	1793360	it involves everything.
1793360	1800880	So in that sense they are the basic law of the universe of reality as such are also modes
1800880	1803320	of being of the things themselves.
1803320	1810480	So they are the categories of thinking are not only the subjective elements which we
1810480	1813120	possess but are also the modes of being.
1813120	1819800	So he is ontologizing them in one sense we can see not empty frames the categories are
1819800	1825200	not just empty frames which receive their concerns sorry which receive their contents
1825200	1831040	from without but are substantial forms that give themselves their own content.
1831040	1838280	See for instance in Kant these categories are empty frames and Kant himself says that
1838280	1845560	percepts without concepts are blind and concepts without percepts are empty.
1845560	1852240	So these categories remain empty if they are not provided with percepts from without but
1852240	1858640	for Hegel they are not so without by their substantial forms the categories of thinking
1858640	1865400	are substantial forms that give themselves their own content both the forms which mold
1865400	1872680	my thought and the stages of eternal creation the categories and here we can see that there
1872680	1878800	are certain very clear objections raised against Kant's idea of pure concepts in limiting
1878800	1884840	the number of concepts Kant has said that it is 12 and Hegel opposes this conception in
1884840	1889280	limiting them to the use of sensory experience Kant would say that sorry Hegel would say
1889280	1895760	that the categories of thinking should be employed in order to know the hall of reality
1895760	1899600	and then again in limiting the knowledge gained by the categories to the status of
1899600	1905000	appearance the division can maintains between phenomena and phenomena.
1905000	1909120	Phenomenal reality is the only reality which we can know with the help of these categories
1909120	1914160	and according to Kant these categories these phenomenal reality the phenomenal reality
1914160	1917480	is a mere appearance reality as such can never be known.
1917480	1925240	So in that sense Kant has confined limited what we experience to the domain of mere
1925240	1932000	appearances and he opposes the deduction of categories in terms of empirical enumeration
1932000	1935360	of pure categories.
1935360	1941080	So here again we can see categories of thinking there is a distinction are not separate from
1941080	1946360	but are intimately connected with each other even in Kant and he attempted an a priori
1946360	1952200	deduction of the categories and empirical enumeration of pure concepts which Hegel opposes.
1952200	1957360	For Hegel these categories of thinking are transformation of one and the same fundamental
1957360	1962840	category the idea of being because for Hegelian philosophy in the true sense of the term there
1962840	1968680	is only one reality which encompasses everything that is the idea of being and not just
1968680	1974480	empirical enumerations but a real deduction which Hegel aims it and in order to deduce
1974480	1980520	them in the real sense Hegel wants us to just leave them just allow them to unfold and
1980520	1982680	observe what is happening.
1982680	1989000	This point onwards we can try to understand what constitutes Hegel's method.
1989000	1994600	Number one Hegel was trying to build upon Kant he retains Kant's idea of the primacy
1994600	1998000	concepts have over sense impressions.
1998000	2003640	These are important in Kant for Hegel also concepts retain their primacy over sense
2003640	2008680	impressions but in a very significantly different way.
2008680	2016320	Again to build upon the romantics extend the use of rational concepts to understand the
2016320	2023600	vast variety of experience and knowledge in psychology, religion, history, culture, literature
2023600	2024600	and art.
2024600	2029520	So, here we can see a merging of Kantianism with Romanticism the Kantian categories which
2029520	2035600	are rational and the romantic approach of reality as a hall to which incorporates all
2035600	2041640	aspects of reality psychology, religion, history, culture, literature and art.
2041640	2046120	And again to construct a new theory of reality a new metaphysics.
2046120	2054400	So, in this context we can examine the metaphysical task of Hegel it is to bring the vast
2054400	2059560	reaches of the human spirit into unification in one theory.
2059560	2066320	So, everything that human spirit endeavors to or everything that the human spirit covers
2066320	2070640	in compasses to bring them into one theory.
2070640	2075360	To bring together the totality of concepts used in the vast structures of all knowledge
2075360	2079520	all the arts and sciences, religion, political thought and history which you have already
2079520	2083920	seen the totalizing tendency in Hegelian philosophy.
2083920	2090040	All these aspects of reality are brought under the concept of absolute spirit the Geist which
2090040	2091040	is rational.
2091040	2098120	So, in that sense the concept of Geist or spirit or we can even translate it as mind
2098120	2105520	because the German word Geist means spirit mind or soul and for both spirit and mind
2105520	2111800	Germans use the word Geist and for Hegel it is both rational and rationally comprehensible.
2111800	2118000	We can also understand it for Kant there is an important difference here for Kant it
2118000	2122880	belongs to the domain of ideas which we can never understand.
2122880	2128840	But here it is both rational and rationally comprehensible in logical structure in natural
2128840	2131200	science and in historical process.
2131200	2139720	So, it is the Geist is manifested in all the aspects of life in logical structures in
2139720	2144200	natural sciences and also in the process of history.
2144200	2153800	The same spirit the same Geist is manifested to show that thought and the matter of thought
2153800	2154800	are not separate.
2154800	2159720	The separation was made by all epistemologists subject and object the epistemological
2159720	2164400	traditions both rationalism and empiricism emphasize on this distinction.
2164400	2170160	But Hegel was trying to sort of overcome this to show that thought and the matter of thought
2170160	2177320	are not separate forms of thought arise historically through the interaction of subject and object.
2177320	2184920	So, again this interactive aspect is emphasized by Hegel because he is approaching philosophy
2184920	2188560	from the perspective of a historian.
2188560	2195080	Psychology as a hall including nature, humanity, history is shaped by and is a manifestation
2195080	2197240	of Geist mind or spirit.
2197240	2203080	So, everything every reality every aspect of reality every sphere of reality is nothing
2203080	2207440	but a manifestation of Geist or spirit.
2207440	2214640	It exhibits self consciousness or self articulation and the manifestation of the self consciousness
2214640	2219920	of Geist in psychology, history, religion, drama, art and philosophy.
2219920	2227920	So, everything every human endeavor the manifestation of this spirit is visible according to Hegel
2227920	2235440	and in this context he proclaims that the real is rational and the rational is real.
2235440	2240080	The absolute spirit or God is the ultimate reality.
2240080	2244760	Reality is a complex totality of rational concepts constituting absolute spirit or
2244760	2250240	God again the real is the rational and the rational is real.
2250240	2256640	The totality of thought is absolute and infinite unlike the finite minds of human beings Geist
2256640	2258240	is the objective mind.
2258240	2263860	So, here he makes a distinction between the objective mind and the finite subjective minds
2263860	2265840	of the human beings.
2265840	2272160	Our minds are finite which tries to understand the infinite mind and this understanding is
2272160	2277680	possible because our finite the so called finite mind is nothing but a manifestation
2277680	2279680	of that universal mind.
2279680	2283840	We are now going to discuss that aspect in the next lecture when we discuss the phenomenology
2283840	2286180	of spirit.
2286180	2292600	But the point here to be noted is that reality is a complex totality of rational concepts
2292600	2295920	constituting absolute spirit of or God.
2295920	2301760	So, there is nothing else but only this rational structures and here there is a very
2301760	2307360	interesting quote from Alfred Weber's book he says I quote according to Hegel the common
2307360	2311680	source of the ego and of nature does not transcend reality.
2311680	2318000	So, in one sense he advocates a kind of immanence which is Aristotelian it is imminent in it
2318000	2324560	mind and nature are not aspects of the absolute or a kind of screen behind which an
2324560	2331280	indifferent and lifeless God lies concealed but its successive modes.
2331280	2337960	The absolute is not immovable but active it is not the principle of nature and of mind
2337960	2344200	but is itself successively nature and mind the succession this process this perpetual
2344200	2346840	generation of things is the absolute itself.
2346840	2352120	So, everything is included under the notion of absolute.
2352120	2358440	So, let us discuss Hegel's absolute idealism in this context.
2358440	2363960	Reality according to Hegel is rational conceptual totality and then integrated and total
2363960	2366400	structure of conceptual truths.
2366400	2373360	So, it is the totality of the conceptual truth reveals itself in all areas of human
2373360	2377640	experience and knowledge which I have already mentioned any aspect of human life you take
2377640	2382880	any aspect any sphere any domain of human life in all such aspects you know you can see
2382880	2386520	the manifestation of this absolute.
2386520	2391800	Reality is rational the vast structure of rational concepts that include all areas and
2391800	2396880	again the real is rational but not different one what is existent naturally there could
2396880	2402520	we can ask the question all that exist in friend of us the events historical events
2402600	2407120	the material things how can you say that they are all rational what he says is what
2407120	2413720	Hegel says is that when you say real is rational and rational is real the real is rational
2413720	2416920	but not different from what is existent.
2416920	2423560	He only says that the rational is the existent object more deeply understood the rational
2423560	2428480	structures need to be understood for that you have to really go to the depth.
2428840	2435360	So, a deeper understanding of reality reveals the rational structures of it again the deeper
2435360	2442840	understanding of the vast realms of physical and organic nature and of society of history
2442840	2448160	of psychology of everything reveals the rational structures.
2448160	2452600	Rational concepts are not independent or transcendental apart from the concrete world
2452640	2459640	like Plato for example, for Plato the rational ideas are independent of it but for him it
2459640	2460640	is not so.
2460640	2466960	So, here you can see an aspect of Aristotelianism rational concepts constitute their rational
2466960	2470520	core of the world of things.
2470520	2477320	Reality is noble its rational structures are noble since human reason and reality share
2477320	2484400	that the same rational structure our finite man can know the infinite reality this is
2484400	2489960	against the Kantian idea the Kantian separation between nomina and phenomena.
2489960	2496560	The absolute mind incorporates all differences so in that sense the absolute mind is a unity
2496560	2503760	in diversity because it includes everything even contradictions are part of it.
2503760	2509880	The absolute reality manifests itself to us in ordinary experience in logic and natural
2509880	2516760	sciences in psychology politics and history in painting poetry and architecture and in
2516760	2523560	religion and philosophy all aspects of life everywhere what is revealed what is manifested
2523560	2529240	is the absolute reality the one and the same absolute reality and its rational structures.
2529240	2533880	Its rational structures are revealed to us because we also possess that rational structure
2533880	2540760	our mind has that ability to think this actually takes us to the problem of dialectical method.
2540760	2545800	The absolute being and logic the absolute being is the common root of the categories
2545800	2553000	of pure concepts it is the emptiest and at the same time the most comprehensive reality
2553120	2560080	it is emptiest because it is not anything for example quote and quote it is not quote
2560080	2566320	and quote something or quote and quote some specific entity which can be determined which
2566320	2573400	can be limited so in that sense it is empty but at the same time it is most comprehensive
2573400	2580120	reality because it is everything something which is everything cannot be something that
2580120	2588760	is a actually the contradiction which later on Hegel results with a concept of synthesis.
2588760	2595160	The most abstract and the most real the most elementary and the most exalted notion all
2595160	2600560	our concepts express modes of being and our transformation of the idea of being.
2600560	2606880	So everything all our concepts all that exists outside everything is a mode of a manifestation
2606880	2614960	of this absolute reality now what is the nature of being how does being which is everything
2614960	2619260	becomes anything else this is the problem which I just mentioned something which is
2619260	2624600	everything the guy is the spirit includes everything it involves everything it encompasses
2624600	2632120	everything something which is everything cannot be something how can it be something then
2632120	2638920	virtue of what principle or inner force is it modified into something so that we can
2638920	2646360	determine what it is how does being which is complete and static initiate movements so
2646360	2654720	that it can become something see in order to become something there should be a movement
2654720	2661760	and movement presupposes what a space to move but the concept of being includes everything
2661760	2665680	and there is no space left even that is also part of it.
2665680	2673840	So how can you conceive of a movement which would make the absolute something being is
2673840	2680280	the most universal notion and hence the poorest and the emptiest since it is the most universal
2680280	2688640	it cannot be anything specific it cannot be anything determinate it becomes totally indeterminate
2688880	2694000	because it is everything something which is everything cannot be something to be something
2694000	2702560	it needs to be determined as a thing but being is by definition indeterminate if you define
2702560	2711600	it or determine it as one thing then it is not everything but being without any determination
2711600	2718080	is non-being so that is the paradox here on the one hand since being is the most universal
2718080	2724480	and the most complete it is also for the same reason it is the poorest and the emptiest
2724480	2730720	in order to become something it has to limit itself which means that it has to cease to
2730720	2737760	be being since it is being it cannot be something but being without any determination is what
2737760	2745040	non-being being pure and simple is equivalent to non-being it is both being and not being
2745120	2752000	both itself and its opposite which is under normal circumstances philosophers consider
2752000	2758200	this as a paradox this as a contradiction which cannot be entertained because philosophers
2758200	2764520	or logicians are against such contradictions but Hegel says that wait hold on this is not
2764520	2769920	the time to say that you know contradictions are to be opposed because contradictions constitute
2769920	2775840	the very core of reality according to Hegel so here he introduces the concept of becoming
2775840	2782720	it is both an immovable and barren thing and for that reason nothing or not being because
2782720	2793600	it is both it becomes something and the contradiction contained in being is resolved in the notion
2793600	2799960	of becoming or development so there is being and non-being and this contradiction between
2799960	2806080	being and non-being because this being is at the same time being and non-being a contradiction
2806080	2812480	and this contradiction involves a tension this tension initiates a movement and as a result
2812480	2818560	the contradiction contained in being is resolved in the notion of becoming or development becoming
2818560	2825880	is both being and non-being both are contained and reconciled in the notion of becoming so
2825880	2832140	as a result what happens something else evolves it becomes something and when it becomes something
2832140	2836960	again the problem is that a new contradiction results which is resolved by a new synthesis
2836960	2845520	and so on until we reach the absolute idea so here we can see the notion of dialectics
2845640	2851760	so Hegel was interestingly proposing that we should reach the absolute through contradictions
2851760	2857040	contradictions are not something which we should be afraid of or we should completely refrain
2857040	2861800	ourselves from but contradictions are the very core of reality contradictions are the very
2861800	2867200	core of human thinking once you approach human thinking once you approach rationality human
2867200	2875240	rationality and once you approach reality historically this thing would be very clear
2875240	2882560	this contradiction is reconciled in a unity a synthesis this is what Hegel says and this
2882560	2889760	is contradicted further and then synthesized is another unity contradictions and unity is
2889760	2895680	go on disappearing and reappearing in the process of development until resolved in the
2895680	2902000	final unity of the absolute idea so it is something like you have a contradiction between
2902000	2910760	two opposing ideas and as a result there is a third idea which is the result of a synthesis
2910760	2918240	of these two opposing ideas and this synthesis itself forms an idea it asserts something
2918240	2927120	and automatically generates its contradiction so the thesis then becomes or the thesis automatically
2927120	2933880	generates its antithesis so you have thesis and antithesis which would generate a synthesis
2933880	2939960	and once the synthesis is generated the synthesis itself becomes a thesis asserts itself as
2939960	2947760	a position which generates its own antithesis owing to its limitations and finite nature
2947760	2954840	anything finite is incomplete so any finite thesis is bound to generate its opposition
2954880	2960360	or its antithesis and then which would ultimately result in a creative conflict of these two
2960360	2966840	a contradiction which will generate a synthesis which would again become a thesis synthesis
2966840	2973480	antithesis synthesis so it goes on and on and finally reaches the infinity or absolute
2973480	2982560	idea now contradictions exist not only in part but also in the things themselves this is
2982560	2987480	what Hegel says it is not just confined to human thinking or thought but objects the
2987480	2993240	world itself the reality itself is composed of or its constitutive of such contradictions
2993240	2999280	antinomies pointed out by Kant are natural they lie in reason and in reality contradictions
2999280	3005760	lie in the nature of reason and since reality itself is reason or rational reality is also
3005760	3009800	bound to be constitutive of contradictions.
3009800	3015000	Then found in the idea of being is resolved in the notion of becoming so you have concepts
3015000	3022160	of being non-being and becoming thesis antithesis and synthesis in the process of becoming being
3022160	3028960	determines itself explains the process of historical development and the development
3028960	3035200	of human thinking as well the dialectical element in thought and reality the dialectic
3035200	3042440	is manifest in every phenomena natural organic political and historical.
3042440	3048640	So in all aspects of life in all spheres of life reality can be seen as a manifestation
3048640	3055200	of this dialectic it constitutes the moving soul of scientific progress we can see that
3055200	3063280	a scientist or a scientific theory is being advanced since it is a definite finite scientific
3063640	3068920	conceptualization it is bound to generates its antithesis its opposition and in that
3068920	3075120	creative conflict between this thesis and antithesis the opposition the conflict a synthesis
3075120	3080040	a better a mature theory evolves and in that way science progresses.
3080040	3085760	So human thinking progresses through dialectical process contradictions are the motive force
3085760	3091800	of all reality the principle of all moment and of all activity we find in reality and
3091800	3097720	they are not unthinkable according to Hegel because thinking itself constitute the very
3097720	3105160	core structure of thinking itself and contradiction is the root of all life and moment because
3105160	3109880	without contradiction everything would become static everything tends to change or pass
3109880	3115760	into its opposites without contradictions everything would be dead existence static
3115760	3121160	externality nothing would be happening but everything would be static without that.
3121160	3126960	And again it suggests that no single concept represents the whole truth truth is the whole
3126960	3133560	the position which we began with this lecture that the whole alone is true all concepts
3133560	3136400	are partial truths.
3136400	3141720	And when we talk about contradictions and their overcoming truth like rational reality is
3141720	3148440	a living process constituted by the entire system of concepts nature does not stop at
3148440	3150280	contradictions but overcomes it.
3150280	3155680	So what Hegel was trying to argue is that though there are contradictions in nature
3155680	3162320	in human thinking there are contradictions in reality nature or reality does not stop
3162320	3167800	with contradictions there is always a tendency to overcome each event of contradiction to
3167800	3170080	a higher form synthesis.
3170080	3174600	Then again it encounters a contradiction over there which is again synthesized or which
3174600	3180760	is again overcome and the process take us to absolute infinity.
3180760	3185600	The process encounters contradictions and overcome them and resolve all of them in the
3185600	3192080	absolute reason can capture this moving reality with the application of the method of dialectic.
3192080	3200360	So the dialectical method which is a method suggested by Hegel to understand this process.
3200360	3206520	Dialectical method basically suggests that reason is not a static faculty of the human
3206520	3213600	mind it is a product of our social heritage the historical development of our social group.
3213600	3219400	So this is where you know the historian in Hegel is relevant in understanding his philosophical
3219400	3220400	concept.
3220400	3225480	So he says that reason is the product of our social heritage the historical development
3225480	3231680	of our social group and reason encounters contradictions and proceed by synthesizing
3231680	3234120	them in that process.
3234120	3238560	And dialectical thinking is a process that seeks to do justice to moving living organic
3238560	3239560	existence.
3239560	3245120	So this is something which Hegel talks about reality it is not a static entity it is living
3245120	3249640	dynamic moving reality.
3249640	3251200	What is dialectic?
3251200	3256680	Dialectic is a very old philosophical concept which is present in ancient Greek tradition
3256680	3261760	the pre-socatic thinkers themselves have discussed about it or the element of dialectic is visible
3261760	3263200	in their thinking as well.
3263200	3267880	Say for example when ancient Greek thought talked about the theory of four elements earth,
3267880	3273200	water, fire and air where reality is composed of earth and air which are sort of
3273400	3278360	contradictory fire and water which are also in opposition.
3278360	3284840	But these apparently contradicting or opposing elements when they come together they constitute
3284840	3285840	a reality.
3285840	3290280	So this conception of dialectic is present even in the thinking of the ancient Greek
3290280	3295160	philosophers and the history of dialectic Socrates plays a very important role and also
3295160	3301680	play too because Socrates uses dialectic is employs it the use of argument in order to
3301680	3303680	make the opponent contradict himself.
3303680	3309480	We have already examined this in the process of Socrates dialogues what happens is Socrates
3309480	3315080	persistently raises certain questions and in that process make his opponent contradict.
3315080	3318240	So the contradictions are exposed in that process.
3318240	3327240	So you make your own or rather the concepts which you hold as true to contradict themselves
3327240	3332800	and then realize that there is some problem in it in the whole process of thinking.
3332800	3337600	But Hegel's concept of dialectic is it is different it is rather richer than any of
3337600	3343240	the other concepts because he conceives it as a synthesis of opposites.
3343240	3348840	Every concept we have has limitations and hence will pass over into its opposite a negation
3348840	3349840	of itself.
3349840	3355120	So in one sense the contradictions according to Hegel we have already seen is a very principle
3355120	3357280	the very core of reality.
3357280	3363240	So in that sense the scope of contradictions of the scope of dialectic is rather infinite
3363240	3364880	in Hegel's philosophy.
3364880	3370320	But when it comes to reason he understands it in this way every concept or every proposition
3370320	3377760	which we assert has its limitations and hence will pass over into its opposite a negation
3377760	3378760	of itself.
3378880	3385200	It is a process which consists of three stages or moments thesis, antithesis and synthesis
3385200	3387040	which I have already explained.
3387040	3392640	The three moments of dialectic is the dialectical process move from a first stage by proposing
3392640	3393640	a thesis.
3393640	3401440	Say for example the entire universe revolved around earth which is a geocentric view of
3401440	3402960	Ptolemy.
3402960	3412800	So here a thesis is proposed advocated but since any and every position every concept
3412800	3423200	or every thinking concept is bound to be partial and incomplete the thesis which is advocated
3423200	3430400	that the entire universe revolves around earth Ptolemy is bound to generate its own antithesis
3430400	3432720	which says that this is not true.
3432720	3441400	It is not true that the entire universe revolves around earth owing to the finite nature and
3441400	3448120	finite feature of any single proposition or any single concept.
3448120	3450760	Now there is a thesis and an antithesis.
3450760	3455960	So the dialectical process moves from a first stage by proposing a thesis.
3455960	3461920	This moves to a second stage which negates opposites or contradicts the first and thus
3461920	3466880	initiates an antithesis it is not the case.
3466880	3473520	And now we have in the history of astronomy Copernicus who proposes a heliocentric view
3473520	3480680	which is much advanced view a mature view than the geocentric view of Ptolemy.
3480680	3486520	This opposition is overcome by a third stage in which the opposing stages are synthesized.
3486520	3492280	The opposing stages of Ptolemy's view and not Ptolemy Ptolemy and not Ptolemy is synthesized
3492280	3494040	in Copernicus.
3494040	3499840	So in one sense we can say that Copernican view the synthesis presupposes both thesis
3499840	3504680	and antithesis antithesis presupposes the thesis.
3504680	3507440	So all these things are interconnected in that way.
3507440	3512320	So if you concentrate or if you focus on only one of them you seem to think that this is
3512320	3517400	that contradiction this needs to be avoided but Hegel would say that this is possible
3517400	3519080	because of that.
3519080	3525280	So there is an interconnectedness between these things.
3525280	3531640	In synthesis a new concept emerges as a higher truth which transcends the theses and the
3531640	3533800	antithesis.
3533800	3538000	So the three functions of the synthesis number one to cancel the conflict between theses
3538000	3545080	and antithesis because between Ptolemy and not Ptolemy the conflict between these two
3545080	3550920	needs to be cancelled by Copernican view which is much superior to preserve or retain the
3550920	3558240	element of truth within the theses and antithesis and then the third one is to transcend the
3558240	3562380	opposition by sublimating the conflict into a higher truth.
3562380	3569360	So the higher truth is the Copernican truth which is which asserts a heliocentric view
3569360	3572580	and let us conclude here our discussion on this.
3572580	3578080	If you examine this process we can see that this process of dialectic of encountering
3578080	3583140	contradictions and overcoming them of having theses antithesis and synthesis involves
3583140	3587940	the process of negation preservation and elevation.
3587940	3594060	So what happens a theses that is initiated is negated example Ptolemy's geocentric
3594060	3600180	view is negated it is not Ptolemy we can put it in this way symbolically Ptolemy and not
3600180	3608140	Ptolemy by the Ptolemy's view by virtue of being a finite assertion a partial assertion
3608140	3612780	generates its own antithesis automatically generates its own antithesis.
3612780	3619540	Now the synthesis preserves both the theses and antithesis in Copernican view Ptolemy's
3619540	3624980	preserved in terms of being what made the former possible Copernican view was possible
3624980	3632820	or rather Copernicus even conceived of such a problem because of Ptolemy and not Ptolemy
3632820	3639180	because of the theses and the antithesis which was initially initiated the synthesis
3639180	3642100	was made possible because of the theses and antithesis.
3642100	3649660	So in that sense it is not only negated but also preserved and then there is another stage
3649660	3657460	that synthesis also elevates as the new account is superior to both the theses and the antithesis.
3657460	3666540	So in that sense the dialectical process involves these three stages negation preservation and
3666540	3667540	elevation.
3667580	3672380	We will discuss these aspects and some of the other details relating to these aspects
3672380	3677940	and some of the other important dimensions of this dialectical method in the next lecture
3677940	3683540	where we will also be examining the concept of spirit the phenomenology of spirit in a
3683540	3685100	different way.
3685100	3687740	So we will wind up this lecture here thank you.
3697540	3698540	.
