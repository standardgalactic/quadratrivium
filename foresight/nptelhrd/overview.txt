1. The dialectical process consists of three moments or stages: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis.
2. A thesis is an initial proposition or assertion (e.g., Ptolemy's geocentric model).
3. An antithesis arises as a negation of the thesis, presenting an opposing view (e.g., "It is not true that the entire universe revolves around Earth").
4. The synthesis stage resolves the contradiction between the thesis and its antithesis by incorporating elements of truth from both, resulting in a new, higher truth (e.g., Copernican heliocentric model).
5. This process involves three functions: cancellation of conflict, preservation of the elements of truth from both thesis and antithesis, and transcendence or elevation of the opposition into a higher unity.
6. The dialectical method includes negation (canceling the conflict), preservation (maintaining the valid aspects of both thesis and antithesis), and elevation (synthesizing into a new truth that is superior to the original statements).
7. This process can be seen in various fields, including natural sciences, as demonstrated by the transition from Ptolemy's geocentric model to Copernicus' heliocentric model.
8. In the next lecture, we will explore these concepts further and delve into Hegel's concept of spirit (Geist) and the phenomenology of spirit.
