00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Welcome to this lecture on aspects of western philosophy module 24 and also lecture number

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:24,120
24. This lecture is going to be on the philosophy of one of the very important thinkers of

3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:33,560
western philosophy Hegel. And we would focus on the following topics in this lecture.

4
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:40,400
We will first of all see the concept of Geist or spirit, mind, it is translated in various

5
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,720
ways. Then we will concentrate on this method of dialectics or rather we would conclude

6
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:52,560
this lecture with that in between we will discuss the concepts of being, non-being and

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,680
becoming. They are all interconnected notions in Hegelian philosophy.

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,640
Well, when we talk about the importance of a philosopher in the history of philosophy,

9
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:10,160
normally we consider two criteria. Number one, the contributions he or she had made

10
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:17,040
to the history of philosophy and number two, the contemporary relevance of these thinkers.

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,440
So, in that sense we can see that you know many of these traditional or even ancient

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,800
philosophers like Plato and Aristotle are still very important, because even today their

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,880
thoughts inspire us, inspire philosophers. But when you try to understand, when you try

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:41,040
to evaluate Hegel in the light of these criteria, I would rather say that both of them, I mean

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,680
if you consider both the aspects like the contributions to the history of philosophy,

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,480
history of thought and history of human intellectual history, we can put it in that way, the entire

17
00:01:53,480 --> 00:02:00,400
human intellectual history owe a lot to Hegelian philosophy. Hegel has inspired thinkers from

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,840
all aspects, all intellectual disciplines and of course, the contemporary relevance

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,440
of Hegel. There are many philosophers in the contemporary

20
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:20,200
world, go back to Hegel's thought, notable philosopher Charles Taylor and many others

21
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,240
and as far as Indian philosophical tradition is concerned, there is a tendency among some

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:31,560
Indian philosophers to compare the Hegelian system of absolute idealism with Vedanta.

23
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,360
So, in that sense Hegel is a very important thinker for us and we will start with concept

24
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,760
of gist or absolute or spirit, but before that let us see some basic details about Hegel.

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:54,480
He was born on August 27th, 1770 and his association with Friedrich Halderin, a very

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,680
important poet, German poet and Schelling led him to read and spend more time on the

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,280
critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant. So, this association with these two great thinkers

28
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,880
played a very important role in Hegel's philosophy and in Hegel's intellectual development.

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:22,200
Then he published his first major philosophical work, the phenomenology of spirit in 1807.

30
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,040
There are many other works he published during his lifetime, I am not going to mention about

31
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,760
all of them, but the attempt is to understand how a philosopher such a great thinker like

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,160
Hegel has actually started his philosophical career and probably in the next lecture we

33
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,560
will concentrate on this whole idea of phenomenology of spirit.

34
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,400
When we talk about the philosophical sources of Hegel, the French rationalism of course

35
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,000
is played a very important role and then comes the British imperialism like all thinkers

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,880
of modern enlightenment philosophy or post enlightenment thought. Hegel was also influenced

37
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:08,320
by the two great traditions of rationalism and empiricism and also Kant, Kant's transcendental

38
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,520
philosophy. Kant being a German, it was quite natural that Kant would have influenced Hegelian

39
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,160
philosophy, Hegel's intellectual growth in a significant manner.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,120
But another very interesting influence on Hegelian philosophy is Romanticism which is

41
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,920
a little condensious, but at the same time we can see that you know Hegel's attempt

42
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,680
to totalize everything or to develop a philosophy, a totalizing theoretical framework owes a

43
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:41,800
lot to Romantic approach or Romanticism. And another important contribution probably

44
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,280
or influence of Romanticism is visible in Hegel's attempt to spiritualize philosophy

45
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,320
which is little against the kind of prevailing systems or prevailing approaches to philosophy

46
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,440
in the Enlightenment age, because Enlightenment always try to see nature as material, but

47
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,760
we can see that Hegel was trying to spiritualize it.

48
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:10,920
So we can see in Hegel's philosophy all these trends the rationalism, empiricism, transcendentalism

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:17,560
or critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, then Romanticism all these you know intellectual

50
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,120
developments converge in a unique manner in Hegelian system of thought.

51
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,800
Now when we talk about Hegel's task as a philosopher, he was trying to formulate a

52
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:36,760
philosophical theory that will reach to infinity. This again a very interesting aspect, because

53
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,960
when you talk about infinity particularly in the backdrop of Enlightenment philosophy,

54
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,280
the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, we have already examined in detail that when

55
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:58,160
Kant discussed the critic of pure reason, he drew a very clear line, he said that it

56
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,320
is impossible to think this side of the line, you can be here, but never try to stretch

57
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:12,000
it and try to apply the categories of human thinking or rational categories to your understanding

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,880
of God or infinite reality or anything. So in that sense, Enlightenment philosophy

59
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:24,240
drew a very clear line between finite and infinity, something which is finite, something

60
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,440
which human beings with their finite minds can understand and there is an infinite reality

61
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:37,000
which we can never probably comprehend. So this line is something which Hegel was trying

62
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,360
to cross. Then again formulated totalizing philosophy that comprehends all reality, when

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,680
you talk about all reality, I mean it includes all aspects of reality, all phases of reality

64
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:57,800
not just one. For instance, for Enlightenment reality is constitutive of the material domain,

65
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,200
rather ultimate real is something which is unknowable according to Kantian philosophy

66
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:11,040
and the phenomenal reality is something which is confined to the domains of percepts and

67
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,880
concepts. So it is basically talks about scientific understanding, but for Hegel history is equally

68
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,760
important like physics. So in one sense we can say that Hegel is historicizing philosophy

69
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,160
or rather is a historian of philosophy, he is definitely not the first historian of philosophy

70
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,800
or first philosopher of history, but Hegel's contributions in this domain, this area is

71
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:43,680
phenomenal. So in that sense we have to understand this particular standpoint that trying to

72
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,680
develop formulate a totalizing philosophy that comprehends all reality, the historical,

73
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,200
psychological, creative, philosophical, scientific, physical, all aspects of reality into one

74
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:03,600
system. A philosophy that accounts for all human experience, the totalizing philosophy

75
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:11,280
that incorporates all knowledge and wisdom, present in science, history, religion, politics,

76
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,280
art and literature are all synthesized in the unique manner in Hegelian system. So in

77
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,080
that sense there are some philosophers, some historians of philosophy would say that Hegel

78
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,080
was the most perfect philosopher, because everything converges into Hegelian system

79
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,280
and the influence of romanticism is quite visible as far as this aspect is concerned.

80
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:40,280
We will have a brief look at what romanticism is to understand to appreciate Hegelian philosophy

81
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:46,760
in a more comprehensive manner. It is a new moment in the realms of literature, philosophy

82
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:52,680
and arts. There are romantic poets, romantic artists who adopted a kind of very unique

83
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:57,440
and very different approach to nature, the relationship between man and nature, the

84
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,080
importance they have given to experiencing nature, the importance they have given to

85
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,120
emotions. Say for example, people like Wordsworth, the importance given to emotions, passions,

86
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,000
the passionate and experiential way in which you relate yourself with nature, all these

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:20,080
things were emphasized by the romantic thinkers and artists. They advocated by artists and

88
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,720
intellectuals who rejected the enlightenment philosophy dominated by reason, logic and

89
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,760
mathematics. As we have already seen, enlightenment philosophy was dominated by these aspects

90
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:38,760
reason, logic. For instance, we have seen it in Immanuel Kant, used literature to express

91
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,880
the inner world of human feelings. So, that is what I meant, the world of feelings, emotions

92
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,520
and passions were highlighted by these thinkers. They protest against the domination of science

93
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,280
in culture, highlighted the inability of science in exhausting the complexities of human

94
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:02,040
experience. Now, for instance, how do you experience a flower? The beauty of a flower,

95
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:08,480
it is more than just having the perceives and concepts as Kant has mentioned about it.

96
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,400
There is something more than that, you know, you experience is that part of an environment

97
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:20,440
or being part of that experience, all these things are emphasized by these romantic thinkers.

98
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,000
It misses the totality of experiences and the feelings associated with it and to understand

99
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,680
the world, not science, but experience as it is lived. So, there is a concept of lived

100
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,400
experiences which is emphasized by them and naturally their conception of reality is also

101
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,000
drastically different from the enlightenment conception, where reality is material as I

102
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,480
already mentioned, reality is spiritual. Nature is spiritualized by the romandist which

103
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:55,040
you can see a trend in Hegel also and nature is not like Newton's mechanical world, but

104
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,280
it is a living spirit which we will find in the conception of geist or spirit in Hegel.

105
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:07,520
The will is important and not reason, because for the enlightenment reason was the major

106
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:12,920
tool for understanding the world, but for these romandist it is the will which plays

107
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,560
an important role, which thus justice to the non-rational aspects of human life.

108
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,120
The idea of polarity, human thought and feeling are characterized by a polarity, there is

109
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,880
a two sidedness which again figures in Hegelian philosophy in the form of dialectics, in the

110
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,920
form of contradictions, we will see it later. And again in the pursuit of the infinite,

111
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,760
never get confined to one more of thought which is again Hegelian, Hegel absorbs these

112
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:46,840
insights, because for Hegel also the whole alone is true, truth is the whole not one

113
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:53,080
particular concept is only a partial truth, it can never represent the whole of truth,

114
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,840
the whole of truth cannot be represented by one concept of one more of thinking.

115
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:04,200
So, this is again Hegelian and never be static, with this understanding in the background

116
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,920
let us come to examine some of the important features of Hegelian philosophy.

117
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:14,840
An observation by Bertrand Russell says that Hegel's philosophy is very difficult, he

118
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:20,560
is I should say the hardest to understand of all great philosophers, probably that is

119
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,280
true to some extent to a philosopher like Bertrand Russell, who subscribes to the analytic

120
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,160
tradition of philosophy, he is more cance in that way, he is more mathematical in that

121
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,720
for example, Russell we would see later in the course of this lecture series, that would

122
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,040
be appreciating more a mathematical scientific approach to philosophy which Hegel is not

123
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,120
subscribing to.

124
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,000
Hegel's central thought is as I already mentioned only the whole is real, a totalizing

125
00:12:53,000 --> 00:13:00,400
approach this is visible in the concept of the gist or spirit, being the central concept

126
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,480
which unifies everything.

127
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:11,480
So, Hegel was trying to formulate a concept which could successfully comprehend all aspects

128
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:18,240
of reality and unifies everything that can be understood and that concept is the concept

129
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,720
of gist or spirit.

130
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,880
All partial facts are abstractions, they have to be brought into connection with the hall

131
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
in order to gain validity.

132
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:35,720
So, this is again a very important Hegelian notion that taking things in isolation is

133
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:45,440
to abstract them, isolate them from the picture of reality, reality is constituted of the hall.

134
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,520
Reality is hall, the self-subsistence of finite things is an illusion, nothing can exist in

135
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,680
isolation everything is necessarily connected with the rest.

136
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,320
So, this is the essence of Hegelian philosophy in one sense and here Russell says once again

137
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,000
Hegel seeks to demonstrate nothing exists independently of relationships against separated

138
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,280
ness influence of mysticism is visible in this context.

139
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:17,440
This is according to Bertrand Russell, he interestingly says that here as far as this

140
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,560
aspect of Hegelian philosophy is concerned he is influenced by his early mystic affiliations

141
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:30,400
because Hegel started his career with I mean he joined a monastery and from there he learned

142
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,160
theology and philosophy.

143
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:38,120
So, this early affiliation with mysticism would have prompted him to conceive things

144
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,800
in this way this is Russell's opinion.

145
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:47,680
Now, let us come to Hegel's concept of reality as I mentioned here the stresses on the hall,

146
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:55,480
the complex system comparable to an organism against Spinoza for whom substance is a simple

147
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,760
or reality is a simple substance.

148
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:05,960
So, here on the one hand we can see that Hegel was also emphasizing like Spinoza did for

149
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:12,240
Spinoza also there is only one substance, one reality that is the substance and for

150
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,480
Hegel also there is a kind of I mean he too points to a notion of reality, a notion of

151
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,320
absolute spirit or mind which is universal.

152
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:32,520
But the difference is that here the reference is to a complex system which is comparable

153
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,680
to an organism as far as Hegelian system is concerned separate things are not an illusion

154
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,640
according to Hegel each has a greater or lesser degree of reality which is not the case with

155
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,480
Spinoza and many others those who are modest.

156
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,280
But for Hegel the separate things the individual things are not illusions and again the reality

157
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,120
of separate things consist in them being an aspect of the hall.

158
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,280
So, at the same time Hegel emphasizes on the importance of the hall.

159
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,640
So, the individual gains its meaning and its significance only in connection with its

160
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,600
being a meaningful part of the hall.

161
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,960
The hall is the absolute.

162
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,560
So, there are concepts these are some of the concepts very important concepts which Hegel

163
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,960
introduces in his philosophy the concept of absolute mind, spirit, geist and there are

164
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,600
several terms which Hegel uses in this context.

165
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,960
And again this reality for Hegel again it is very interesting to note this difference

166
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:46,080
the difference between the conceptions of reality advocated by Hegel and how he has formulated

167
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,000
it as opposed to the enlightenment conception.

168
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
In enlightenment conception for example, the Kantian view of reality the phenomenal world

169
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,120
is a world of cause and effect though this is something which the mind attributes to

170
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
the world.

171
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,800
It is true we are the law givers according to Kant, but at the same time it is governed

172
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,720
by a cause effect relationship the phenomenal world is governed by a cause effect relationship

173
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:20,280
which to some extent Hegel also except, but he makes a major deviation here he says that

174
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,160
it is governed by the principle of teleological causality.

175
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:29,040
So, here he is very close to Aristotle, Aristotle also has a conception of teleology that everything

176
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,480
has a purpose a higher purpose to be realized and there are two principles which are relevant

177
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:40,280
in Aristotelian philosophy at potentiality and actuality.

178
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,720
And in the process of change according to Aristotle every change is evolution we have

179
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,120
already seen it in one of our previous lectures.

180
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,640
Since every change is in evolution in the process of evolution what happens is that

181
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,320
an object realizes materializes its potentialities or actualizes the potentialities.

182
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:06,200
So, here again something like that we can see that everything progresses towards what

183
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,200
the absolute according to Hegel.

184
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,480
So, governed by the principle of teleological causality and not just mechanical efficient

185
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,000
causality.

186
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The meaning of each stage is realized in the hall which is the rational and again a revision

187
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,760
of the conception of rationality which is advocated by the modern philosophers by enlarge

188
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:35,120
and particularly the enlightenment thinkers like Kant to overcome Kantian separation of

189
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,520
Nomina and Phenomena.

190
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Because if you approach reality with the Kantian model then it is impossible to know the Nomina

191
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,000
there is a clear separation as I already mentioned a line is drawn between Nomina and Phenomena

192
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,200
something which you can know and the reality which you can never know.

193
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,280
That is because Kant and the enlightenment philosophers advocated a very peculiar conception

194
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,400
of rationality by means of which reality is comprehended.

195
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,440
This rationality has two aspects I have already mentioned it in my previous lectures the

196
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,320
percepts and concepts with the interaction of these two reality the phenomenal world

197
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
is revealed.

198
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,440
But something which lies beyond that the nominal reality can never be known.

199
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:28,720
But Hegel was consciously making an attempt to overcome this dichotomy to know Nomina

200
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,060
and that is why the principle of teleological causality is important in Hegelian system its

201
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,960
identification spirit as activity.

202
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,960
So reality is being identified as a spiritual phenomena as an activity not as a static thing

203
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:51,080
but as an activity which comprehends everything even the comprehending mind even the mind

204
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,120
which understands it is also part of that.

205
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:00,080
So it encompasses everything the conception of reality and then again there we can see

206
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,280
Aristotle's influence where identification of the fully substantial being with spirit

207
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,160
which is in essence is activity.

208
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,660
So here also we can see that reality or the absolute or the spirit the absolute mind is

209
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:22,360
conceived as an activity as a process which progressively takes us to the reason to the

210
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,400
infinity.

211
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,080
Again things have meaning the process is rational there is a rational order.

212
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:37,320
So this is another important feature of Hegelian thought that he says that this process by

213
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,360
means of which reality exist reality itself is a process it is not a static entity but

214
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:50,080
it is a process a dynamic process but this process has a meaning it is teleological and

215
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,080
also it is a rational process it is a process of rational unfolding we can mentioned in

216
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,080
that way.

217
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,280
Hall is like an organism that is rational purposive and with full meaning.

218
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,920
Again the Kantian approach is not suitable to know it because the Kantian approach will

219
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:14,160
never accept this comprehensive perspective for Kant there is always a separation the

220
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,920
subject and object are different for Kant for Hegel the subject and object can never

221
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:27,200
be different both are comprehended or both are encompassed by the single reality called

222
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
the absolute.

223
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,840
Then again Kantian rationality is insufficient in knowing this process because Kantian

224
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,880
rationality employs the twelve categories of understanding which limits everything to

225
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,200
a certain structure which is provided by the mind transcendental a perception which is

226
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,280
not acceptable for Hegel.

227
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,640
Now let us come to the Kantian problem because we have been discussing about Kant and Kantian

228
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,560
model of rationality a lot let us see what happens here the ego the mind because we have

229
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:07,440
already seen that Kant was I mean it is being stated that Kant is initiating a kind of Copernican

230
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,880
revolution in philosophy and this Copernican revolution consists in placing the subject

231
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,120
the mind the ego at the center of the knowing activity as I have already mentioned in this

232
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:23,600
lecture sometime back that we are the low givers of the universe this is the Kantian

233
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
position.

234
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:32,400
Now what is this ego the low giver the ego or mind according to Kant is the condition

235
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,840
of the possibility of things appearing to the subject.

236
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,520
So this is the Kantian position it is a precondition that is why it is called transcendental critical

237
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:48,720
philosophy because it talks about the condition of the possibility of things appearing to

238
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,520
the subject and again ego is an abstract account of the forms of thought or categories of

239
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
understanding.

240
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,840
So Kantian ego can be understood in terms of this an abstract account of the forms of

241
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,520
thought or categories of understanding there are twelve categories of understanding according

242
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,520
to Kant.

243
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,400
Kantian ego can be equated with that the empirical ego can be equated with that and

244
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:21,440
again reason for in that framework is a faculty of the soul or ego constituted of a combination

245
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,520
of principles forms or rules according to which we think.

246
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,880
So these qualities quantity modality and relations these twelve categories would enable

247
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,520
us to think in a particular way.

248
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:41,420
So the world as such can never be known but we understand it by attributing certain principles

249
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:48,160
and laws from our side to it that is the Kantian peculiarity and mind is separated from the

250
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,400
world as I mentioned mind is the low giver of the world.

251
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,360
So it is not only epistemologically different from the world but is also ontologically

252
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,320
different from the world.

253
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:09,400
Forms of thought from what they are forms of mind from what they are forms of the world.

254
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,960
So Kantian philosophy introduces several such categories there is the mind the domain of

255
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:22,440
the ego the low giver the forms of thought then there is a world the phenomenal world

256
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,120
what we know and there is a nominal domain of reality which we will never know.

257
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,920
So these are all various aspects of Kantian philosophical systems and again the problem

258
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,280
is that there is a gap between mind and the world.

259
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:48,540
There is a gap between the mind and the world here which can be better articulated by separating

260
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,640
the phenomena with the nominal.

261
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,920
The nominal reality is constitutive of higher realities which can never be known and the

262
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:02,480
phenomenal reality is something which is spatio-temporally given to us which we experience.

263
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:09,880
So this gap between nominal and phenomena is actually the gap between mind and the world

264
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,280
and the problem of the nominal or things in themselves which can never be known.

265
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:21,480
Things in themselves can never be known again problem of antinomies which we have already

266
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:28,040
discussed when we try to apply these categories of understanding to the nominal world or entities

267
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:32,880
in the nominal world reality as such say for example when we try to understand the solve

268
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,280
about which we do not have percepts but we try to categorize it without having percepts

269
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,560
we are ultimately bound to end up with antinomies where you have certain contradictory statements

270
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,640
which apparently both of them seem to be equally valid.

271
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,600
Now Hegel's phenomenology of spirit attempts to give an alternate account of this relationship

272
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,680
and show how that this gap can be overcome.

273
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:08,400
So this is what ultimately tries to say phenomenology of the mind or phenomenology of spirit which

274
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,240
basically talks about the evolution of the human mind from through several stages to

275
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,280
the ultimate stage where it reaches the absolute or which where it realizes in the absolute.

276
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,880
So this process we will examine in detail in the next lecture.

277
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,320
So it is here with this work Hegel tries to overcome the distinction between nominal

278
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,280
and phenomenal realities.

279
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:43,000
And when we talk about Kantian philosophy Vizavi Hegelian thought Kant we had seen already

280
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,720
that was influenced by the physical sciences and thinking is confined to the scientific

281
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,800
level that is why he has this model of thinking which is constitutive of percepts and concepts.

282
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,600
Then again contradictions in thinking are inevitable at this level because you have you are limited

283
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,360
to the percepts and concepts and when you are trying to apply this to a world which

284
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:17,360
is apparently not limited or not confined to any of these constraints then you are bound

285
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,200
to end up in contradictions.

286
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,800
Hegel on the other hand adopts the approach of a historian this is what I mentioned earlier

287
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:31,120
that there is an approach of a historian historical approach in philosophy.

288
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:37,000
Thinking as an activity of spirit or reason and not confined to the scientific level and

289
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,280
he rises above contradictions to their synthesis.

290
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:46,600
So that we will see in the later part of this lecture the concept of synthesis which is

291
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,080
the culmination of dialectical process.

292
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,440
Now Hegel's view of reason we can see that reason is the law according to which being

293
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,800
is produced constituted and unfolding.

294
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,840
He has a very an extremely comprehensive concept of rationality or reason where it is a

295
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:10,560
law according to which being is produced the entire reality is not different from reason.

296
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,840
So rational and real are one and the same.

297
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,540
So later on Hegel would proclaim really is rational and rational is real.

298
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:26,040
It is constituted and unfolded in reason and both subjective faculty and objective reality

299
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,080
are constitutive of this reason.

300
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,680
See this is again a very important deviation from the enlightenment conception.

301
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,560
In the enlightenment conception we have seen that there is a subject and the object they

302
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,560
are different from each other and they are constitutive of different realities ontological

303
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,520
different epistemologically different.

304
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:53,240
But in Hegelian system both the subjective and the objective faculties are constituted

305
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,480
by reason.

306
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,640
See reason according to Hegel is a subjective faculty as the essence and norm of our thinking

307
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,800
or our thought the way in which we think what our thinking itself is and on the other side

308
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:13,280
it is an objective reality as the essence and law of the evolution of things.

309
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:19,200
We have seen this whole notion of categories of thinking when we have discussed tension

310
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,800
philosophy and Hegel also was interested in this idea of categories the categories of

311
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,240
human thinking.

312
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:33,600
But the major difference is that for Hegel these categories of thinking are not just

313
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,960
subjective elements of our thinking as Kant conceived it is it is not just subjective

314
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:44,440
elements but this categories of thinking are according to him the categories of reason

315
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:51,920
itself and reason according to him as I already mentioned encompasses comprehends everything

316
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,360
it involves everything.

317
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:00,880
So in that sense they are the basic law of the universe of reality as such are also modes

318
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,320
of being of the things themselves.

319
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,480
So they are the categories of thinking are not only the subjective elements which we

320
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:13,120
possess but are also the modes of being.

321
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,800
So he is ontologizing them in one sense we can see not empty frames the categories are

322
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,200
not just empty frames which receive their concerns sorry which receive their contents

323
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,040
from without but are substantial forms that give themselves their own content.

324
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,280
See for instance in Kant these categories are empty frames and Kant himself says that

325
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:45,560
percepts without concepts are blind and concepts without percepts are empty.

326
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:52,240
So these categories remain empty if they are not provided with percepts from without but

327
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,640
for Hegel they are not so without by their substantial forms the categories of thinking

328
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,400
are substantial forms that give themselves their own content both the forms which mold

329
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:12,680
my thought and the stages of eternal creation the categories and here we can see that there

330
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:18,800
are certain very clear objections raised against Kant's idea of pure concepts in limiting

331
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,840
the number of concepts Kant has said that it is 12 and Hegel opposes this conception in

332
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,280
limiting them to the use of sensory experience Kant would say that sorry Hegel would say

333
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:35,760
that the categories of thinking should be employed in order to know the hall of reality

334
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,600
and then again in limiting the knowledge gained by the categories to the status of

335
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,000
appearance the division can maintains between phenomena and phenomena.

336
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,120
Phenomenal reality is the only reality which we can know with the help of these categories

337
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,160
and according to Kant these categories these phenomenal reality the phenomenal reality

338
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,480
is a mere appearance reality as such can never be known.

339
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:05,240
So in that sense Kant has confined limited what we experience to the domain of mere

340
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:12,000
appearances and he opposes the deduction of categories in terms of empirical enumeration

341
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,360
of pure categories.

342
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,080
So here again we can see categories of thinking there is a distinction are not separate from

343
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:26,360
but are intimately connected with each other even in Kant and he attempted an a priori

344
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,200
deduction of the categories and empirical enumeration of pure concepts which Hegel opposes.

345
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,360
For Hegel these categories of thinking are transformation of one and the same fundamental

346
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:42,840
category the idea of being because for Hegelian philosophy in the true sense of the term there

347
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,680
is only one reality which encompasses everything that is the idea of being and not just

348
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,480
empirical enumerations but a real deduction which Hegel aims it and in order to deduce

349
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,520
them in the real sense Hegel wants us to just leave them just allow them to unfold and

350
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,680
observe what is happening.

351
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:09,000
This point onwards we can try to understand what constitutes Hegel's method.

352
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,600
Number one Hegel was trying to build upon Kant he retains Kant's idea of the primacy

353
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,000
concepts have over sense impressions.

354
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,640
These are important in Kant for Hegel also concepts retain their primacy over sense

355
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,680
impressions but in a very significantly different way.

356
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:36,320
Again to build upon the romantics extend the use of rational concepts to understand the

357
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:43,600
vast variety of experience and knowledge in psychology, religion, history, culture, literature

358
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
and art.

359
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,520
So, here we can see a merging of Kantianism with Romanticism the Kantian categories which

360
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:55,600
are rational and the romantic approach of reality as a hall to which incorporates all

361
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,640
aspects of reality psychology, religion, history, culture, literature and art.

362
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:06,120
And again to construct a new theory of reality a new metaphysics.

363
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:14,400
So, in this context we can examine the metaphysical task of Hegel it is to bring the vast

364
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,560
reaches of the human spirit into unification in one theory.

365
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:26,320
So, everything that human spirit endeavors to or everything that the human spirit covers

366
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,640
in compasses to bring them into one theory.

367
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:35,360
To bring together the totality of concepts used in the vast structures of all knowledge

368
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,520
all the arts and sciences, religion, political thought and history which you have already

369
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,920
seen the totalizing tendency in Hegelian philosophy.

370
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:50,040
All these aspects of reality are brought under the concept of absolute spirit the Geist which

371
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,040
is rational.

372
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,120
So, in that sense the concept of Geist or spirit or we can even translate it as mind

373
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:05,520
because the German word Geist means spirit mind or soul and for both spirit and mind

374
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,800
Germans use the word Geist and for Hegel it is both rational and rationally comprehensible.

375
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:18,000
We can also understand it for Kant there is an important difference here for Kant it

376
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,880
belongs to the domain of ideas which we can never understand.

377
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,840
But here it is both rational and rationally comprehensible in logical structure in natural

378
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,200
science and in historical process.

379
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:39,720
So, it is the Geist is manifested in all the aspects of life in logical structures in

380
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:44,200
natural sciences and also in the process of history.

381
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:53,800
The same spirit the same Geist is manifested to show that thought and the matter of thought

382
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
are not separate.

383
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,720
The separation was made by all epistemologists subject and object the epistemological

384
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:04,400
traditions both rationalism and empiricism emphasize on this distinction.

385
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:10,160
But Hegel was trying to sort of overcome this to show that thought and the matter of thought

386
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,320
are not separate forms of thought arise historically through the interaction of subject and object.

387
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:24,920
So, again this interactive aspect is emphasized by Hegel because he is approaching philosophy

388
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,560
from the perspective of a historian.

389
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,080
Psychology as a hall including nature, humanity, history is shaped by and is a manifestation

390
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,240
of Geist mind or spirit.

391
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,080
So, everything every reality every aspect of reality every sphere of reality is nothing

392
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,440
but a manifestation of Geist or spirit.

393
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,640
It exhibits self consciousness or self articulation and the manifestation of the self consciousness

394
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:59,920
of Geist in psychology, history, religion, drama, art and philosophy.

395
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:07,920
So, everything every human endeavor the manifestation of this spirit is visible according to Hegel

396
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:15,440
and in this context he proclaims that the real is rational and the rational is real.

397
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,080
The absolute spirit or God is the ultimate reality.

398
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,760
Reality is a complex totality of rational concepts constituting absolute spirit or

399
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,240
God again the real is the rational and the rational is real.

400
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,640
The totality of thought is absolute and infinite unlike the finite minds of human beings Geist

401
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,240
is the objective mind.

402
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,860
So, here he makes a distinction between the objective mind and the finite subjective minds

403
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,840
of the human beings.

404
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:52,160
Our minds are finite which tries to understand the infinite mind and this understanding is

405
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,680
possible because our finite the so called finite mind is nothing but a manifestation

406
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,680
of that universal mind.

407
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,840
We are now going to discuss that aspect in the next lecture when we discuss the phenomenology

408
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:06,180
of spirit.

409
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:12,600
But the point here to be noted is that reality is a complex totality of rational concepts

410
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,920
constituting absolute spirit of or God.

411
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,760
So, there is nothing else but only this rational structures and here there is a very

412
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,360
interesting quote from Alfred Weber's book he says I quote according to Hegel the common

413
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,680
source of the ego and of nature does not transcend reality.

414
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,000
So, in one sense he advocates a kind of immanence which is Aristotelian it is imminent in it

415
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,560
mind and nature are not aspects of the absolute or a kind of screen behind which an

416
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:51,280
indifferent and lifeless God lies concealed but its successive modes.

417
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,960
The absolute is not immovable but active it is not the principle of nature and of mind

418
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,200
but is itself successively nature and mind the succession this process this perpetual

419
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,840
generation of things is the absolute itself.

420
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,120
So, everything is included under the notion of absolute.

421
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:18,440
So, let us discuss Hegel's absolute idealism in this context.

422
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,960
Reality according to Hegel is rational conceptual totality and then integrated and total

423
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,400
structure of conceptual truths.

424
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,360
So, it is the totality of the conceptual truth reveals itself in all areas of human

425
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,640
experience and knowledge which I have already mentioned any aspect of human life you take

426
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,880
any aspect any sphere any domain of human life in all such aspects you know you can see

427
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,520
the manifestation of this absolute.

428
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,800
Reality is rational the vast structure of rational concepts that include all areas and

429
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,880
again the real is rational but not different one what is existent naturally there could

430
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,520
we can ask the question all that exist in friend of us the events historical events

431
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,120
the material things how can you say that they are all rational what he says is what

432
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,720
Hegel says is that when you say real is rational and rational is real the real is rational

433
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,920
but not different from what is existent.

434
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,560
He only says that the rational is the existent object more deeply understood the rational

435
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:28,480
structures need to be understood for that you have to really go to the depth.

436
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:35,360
So, a deeper understanding of reality reveals the rational structures of it again the deeper

437
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:42,840
understanding of the vast realms of physical and organic nature and of society of history

438
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:48,160
of psychology of everything reveals the rational structures.

439
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,600
Rational concepts are not independent or transcendental apart from the concrete world

440
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,640
like Plato for example, for Plato the rational ideas are independent of it but for him it

441
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,640
is not so.

442
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,960
So, here you can see an aspect of Aristotelianism rational concepts constitute their rational

443
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,520
core of the world of things.

444
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:17,320
Reality is noble its rational structures are noble since human reason and reality share

445
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,400
that the same rational structure our finite man can know the infinite reality this is

446
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,960
against the Kantian idea the Kantian separation between nomina and phenomena.

447
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,560
The absolute mind incorporates all differences so in that sense the absolute mind is a unity

448
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,760
in diversity because it includes everything even contradictions are part of it.

449
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,880
The absolute reality manifests itself to us in ordinary experience in logic and natural

450
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:56,760
sciences in psychology politics and history in painting poetry and architecture and in

451
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:03,560
religion and philosophy all aspects of life everywhere what is revealed what is manifested

452
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:09,240
is the absolute reality the one and the same absolute reality and its rational structures.

453
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,880
Its rational structures are revealed to us because we also possess that rational structure

454
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,760
our mind has that ability to think this actually takes us to the problem of dialectical method.

455
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,800
The absolute being and logic the absolute being is the common root of the categories

456
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:33,000
of pure concepts it is the emptiest and at the same time the most comprehensive reality

457
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:40,080
it is emptiest because it is not anything for example quote and quote it is not quote

458
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:46,320
and quote something or quote and quote some specific entity which can be determined which

459
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:53,400
can be limited so in that sense it is empty but at the same time it is most comprehensive

460
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,120
reality because it is everything something which is everything cannot be something that

461
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:08,760
is a actually the contradiction which later on Hegel results with a concept of synthesis.

462
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:15,160
The most abstract and the most real the most elementary and the most exalted notion all

463
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,560
our concepts express modes of being and our transformation of the idea of being.

464
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,880
So everything all our concepts all that exists outside everything is a mode of a manifestation

465
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:34,960
of this absolute reality now what is the nature of being how does being which is everything

466
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,260
becomes anything else this is the problem which I just mentioned something which is

467
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,600
everything the guy is the spirit includes everything it involves everything it encompasses

468
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:52,120
everything something which is everything cannot be something how can it be something then

469
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:58,920
virtue of what principle or inner force is it modified into something so that we can

470
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:06,360
determine what it is how does being which is complete and static initiate movements so

471
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:14,720
that it can become something see in order to become something there should be a movement

472
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:21,760
and movement presupposes what a space to move but the concept of being includes everything

473
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,680
and there is no space left even that is also part of it.

474
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:33,840
So how can you conceive of a movement which would make the absolute something being is

475
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:40,280
the most universal notion and hence the poorest and the emptiest since it is the most universal

476
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:48,640
it cannot be anything specific it cannot be anything determinate it becomes totally indeterminate

477
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,000
because it is everything something which is everything cannot be something to be something

478
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:02,560
it needs to be determined as a thing but being is by definition indeterminate if you define

479
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:11,600
it or determine it as one thing then it is not everything but being without any determination

480
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:18,080
is non-being so that is the paradox here on the one hand since being is the most universal

481
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:24,480
and the most complete it is also for the same reason it is the poorest and the emptiest

482
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,720
in order to become something it has to limit itself which means that it has to cease to

483
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:37,760
be being since it is being it cannot be something but being without any determination is what

484
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:45,040
non-being being pure and simple is equivalent to non-being it is both being and not being

485
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:52,000
both itself and its opposite which is under normal circumstances philosophers consider

486
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,200
this as a paradox this as a contradiction which cannot be entertained because philosophers

487
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,520
or logicians are against such contradictions but Hegel says that wait hold on this is not

488
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,920
the time to say that you know contradictions are to be opposed because contradictions constitute

489
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:15,840
the very core of reality according to Hegel so here he introduces the concept of becoming

490
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:22,720
it is both an immovable and barren thing and for that reason nothing or not being because

491
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:33,600
it is both it becomes something and the contradiction contained in being is resolved in the notion

492
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:39,960
of becoming or development so there is being and non-being and this contradiction between

493
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:46,080
being and non-being because this being is at the same time being and non-being a contradiction

494
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:52,480
and this contradiction involves a tension this tension initiates a movement and as a result

495
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,560
the contradiction contained in being is resolved in the notion of becoming or development becoming

496
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:05,880
is both being and non-being both are contained and reconciled in the notion of becoming so

497
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:12,140
as a result what happens something else evolves it becomes something and when it becomes something

498
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,960
again the problem is that a new contradiction results which is resolved by a new synthesis

499
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:25,520
and so on until we reach the absolute idea so here we can see the notion of dialectics

500
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:31,760
so Hegel was interestingly proposing that we should reach the absolute through contradictions

501
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,040
contradictions are not something which we should be afraid of or we should completely refrain

502
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,800
ourselves from but contradictions are the very core of reality contradictions are the very

503
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:47,200
core of human thinking once you approach human thinking once you approach rationality human

504
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,240
rationality and once you approach reality historically this thing would be very clear

505
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:02,560
this contradiction is reconciled in a unity a synthesis this is what Hegel says and this

506
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:09,760
is contradicted further and then synthesized is another unity contradictions and unity is

507
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:15,680
go on disappearing and reappearing in the process of development until resolved in the

508
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,000
final unity of the absolute idea so it is something like you have a contradiction between

509
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:30,760
two opposing ideas and as a result there is a third idea which is the result of a synthesis

510
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:38,240
of these two opposing ideas and this synthesis itself forms an idea it asserts something

511
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:47,120
and automatically generates its contradiction so the thesis then becomes or the thesis automatically

512
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:53,880
generates its antithesis so you have thesis and antithesis which would generate a synthesis

513
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:59,960
and once the synthesis is generated the synthesis itself becomes a thesis asserts itself as

514
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:07,760
a position which generates its own antithesis owing to its limitations and finite nature

515
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:14,840
anything finite is incomplete so any finite thesis is bound to generate its opposition

516
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,360
or its antithesis and then which would ultimately result in a creative conflict of these two

517
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:26,840
a contradiction which will generate a synthesis which would again become a thesis synthesis

518
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,480
antithesis synthesis so it goes on and on and finally reaches the infinity or absolute

519
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:42,560
idea now contradictions exist not only in part but also in the things themselves this is

520
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:47,480
what Hegel says it is not just confined to human thinking or thought but objects the

521
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:53,240
world itself the reality itself is composed of or its constitutive of such contradictions

522
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:59,280
antinomies pointed out by Kant are natural they lie in reason and in reality contradictions

523
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,760
lie in the nature of reason and since reality itself is reason or rational reality is also

524
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,800
bound to be constitutive of contradictions.

525
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:15,000
Then found in the idea of being is resolved in the notion of becoming so you have concepts

526
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:22,160
of being non-being and becoming thesis antithesis and synthesis in the process of becoming being

527
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:28,960
determines itself explains the process of historical development and the development

528
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:35,200
of human thinking as well the dialectical element in thought and reality the dialectic

529
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,440
is manifest in every phenomena natural organic political and historical.

530
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:48,640
So in all aspects of life in all spheres of life reality can be seen as a manifestation

531
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,200
of this dialectic it constitutes the moving soul of scientific progress we can see that

532
00:50:55,200 --> 00:51:03,280
a scientist or a scientific theory is being advanced since it is a definite finite scientific

533
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,920
conceptualization it is bound to generates its antithesis its opposition and in that

534
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:15,120
creative conflict between this thesis and antithesis the opposition the conflict a synthesis

535
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:20,040
a better a mature theory evolves and in that way science progresses.

536
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:25,760
So human thinking progresses through dialectical process contradictions are the motive force

537
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,800
of all reality the principle of all moment and of all activity we find in reality and

538
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,720
they are not unthinkable according to Hegel because thinking itself constitute the very

539
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:45,160
core structure of thinking itself and contradiction is the root of all life and moment because

540
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,880
without contradiction everything would become static everything tends to change or pass

541
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:55,760
into its opposites without contradictions everything would be dead existence static

542
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,160
externality nothing would be happening but everything would be static without that.

543
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,960
And again it suggests that no single concept represents the whole truth truth is the whole

544
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:13,560
the position which we began with this lecture that the whole alone is true all concepts

545
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,400
are partial truths.

546
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,720
And when we talk about contradictions and their overcoming truth like rational reality is

547
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:28,440
a living process constituted by the entire system of concepts nature does not stop at

548
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,280
contradictions but overcomes it.

549
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:35,680
So what Hegel was trying to argue is that though there are contradictions in nature

550
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:42,320
in human thinking there are contradictions in reality nature or reality does not stop

551
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:47,800
with contradictions there is always a tendency to overcome each event of contradiction to

552
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,080
a higher form synthesis.

553
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:54,600
Then again it encounters a contradiction over there which is again synthesized or which

554
00:52:54,600 --> 00:53:00,760
is again overcome and the process take us to absolute infinity.

555
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:05,600
The process encounters contradictions and overcome them and resolve all of them in the

556
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:12,080
absolute reason can capture this moving reality with the application of the method of dialectic.

557
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:20,360
So the dialectical method which is a method suggested by Hegel to understand this process.

558
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:26,520
Dialectical method basically suggests that reason is not a static faculty of the human

559
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:33,600
mind it is a product of our social heritage the historical development of our social group.

560
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,400
So this is where you know the historian in Hegel is relevant in understanding his philosophical

561
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:40,400
concept.

562
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:45,480
So he says that reason is the product of our social heritage the historical development

563
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:51,680
of our social group and reason encounters contradictions and proceed by synthesizing

564
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,120
them in that process.

565
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:58,560
And dialectical thinking is a process that seeks to do justice to moving living organic

566
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:59,560
existence.

567
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:05,120
So this is something which Hegel talks about reality it is not a static entity it is living

568
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:09,640
dynamic moving reality.

569
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,200
What is dialectic?

570
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,680
Dialectic is a very old philosophical concept which is present in ancient Greek tradition

571
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:21,760
the pre-socatic thinkers themselves have discussed about it or the element of dialectic is visible

572
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:23,200
in their thinking as well.

573
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:27,880
Say for example when ancient Greek thought talked about the theory of four elements earth,

574
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:33,200
water, fire and air where reality is composed of earth and air which are sort of

575
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,360
contradictory fire and water which are also in opposition.

576
00:54:38,360 --> 00:54:44,840
But these apparently contradicting or opposing elements when they come together they constitute

577
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:45,840
a reality.

578
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,280
So this conception of dialectic is present even in the thinking of the ancient Greek

579
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:55,160
philosophers and the history of dialectic Socrates plays a very important role and also

580
00:54:55,160 --> 00:55:01,680
play too because Socrates uses dialectic is employs it the use of argument in order to

581
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,680
make the opponent contradict himself.

582
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,480
We have already examined this in the process of Socrates dialogues what happens is Socrates

583
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,080
persistently raises certain questions and in that process make his opponent contradict.

584
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,240
So the contradictions are exposed in that process.

585
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:27,240
So you make your own or rather the concepts which you hold as true to contradict themselves

586
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,800
and then realize that there is some problem in it in the whole process of thinking.

587
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:37,600
But Hegel's concept of dialectic is it is different it is rather richer than any of

588
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:43,240
the other concepts because he conceives it as a synthesis of opposites.

589
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:48,840
Every concept we have has limitations and hence will pass over into its opposite a negation

590
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:49,840
of itself.

591
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:55,120
So in one sense the contradictions according to Hegel we have already seen is a very principle

592
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,280
the very core of reality.

593
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:03,240
So in that sense the scope of contradictions of the scope of dialectic is rather infinite

594
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:04,880
in Hegel's philosophy.

595
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,320
But when it comes to reason he understands it in this way every concept or every proposition

596
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:17,760
which we assert has its limitations and hence will pass over into its opposite a negation

597
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,760
of itself.

598
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:25,200
It is a process which consists of three stages or moments thesis, antithesis and synthesis

599
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,040
which I have already explained.

600
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,640
The three moments of dialectic is the dialectical process move from a first stage by proposing

601
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,640
a thesis.

602
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:41,440
Say for example the entire universe revolved around earth which is a geocentric view of

603
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,960
Ptolemy.

604
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:52,800
So here a thesis is proposed advocated but since any and every position every concept

605
00:56:52,800 --> 00:57:03,200
or every thinking concept is bound to be partial and incomplete the thesis which is advocated

606
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:10,400
that the entire universe revolves around earth Ptolemy is bound to generate its own antithesis

607
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,720
which says that this is not true.

608
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:21,400
It is not true that the entire universe revolves around earth owing to the finite nature and

609
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:28,120
finite feature of any single proposition or any single concept.

610
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,760
Now there is a thesis and an antithesis.

611
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,960
So the dialectical process moves from a first stage by proposing a thesis.

612
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:41,920
This moves to a second stage which negates opposites or contradicts the first and thus

613
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,880
initiates an antithesis it is not the case.

614
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,520
And now we have in the history of astronomy Copernicus who proposes a heliocentric view

615
00:57:53,520 --> 00:58:00,680
which is much advanced view a mature view than the geocentric view of Ptolemy.

616
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:06,520
This opposition is overcome by a third stage in which the opposing stages are synthesized.

617
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:12,280
The opposing stages of Ptolemy's view and not Ptolemy Ptolemy and not Ptolemy is synthesized

618
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,040
in Copernicus.

619
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:19,840
So in one sense we can say that Copernican view the synthesis presupposes both thesis

620
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,680
and antithesis antithesis presupposes the thesis.

621
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:27,440
So all these things are interconnected in that way.

622
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:32,320
So if you concentrate or if you focus on only one of them you seem to think that this is

623
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:37,400
that contradiction this needs to be avoided but Hegel would say that this is possible

624
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:39,080
because of that.

625
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:45,280
So there is an interconnectedness between these things.

626
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:51,640
In synthesis a new concept emerges as a higher truth which transcends the theses and the

627
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:53,800
antithesis.

628
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:58,000
So the three functions of the synthesis number one to cancel the conflict between theses

629
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,080
and antithesis because between Ptolemy and not Ptolemy the conflict between these two

630
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,920
needs to be cancelled by Copernican view which is much superior to preserve or retain the

631
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:18,240
element of truth within the theses and antithesis and then the third one is to transcend the

632
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:22,380
opposition by sublimating the conflict into a higher truth.

633
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:29,360
So the higher truth is the Copernican truth which is which asserts a heliocentric view

634
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,580
and let us conclude here our discussion on this.

635
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:38,080
If you examine this process we can see that this process of dialectic of encountering

636
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:43,140
contradictions and overcoming them of having theses antithesis and synthesis involves

637
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:47,940
the process of negation preservation and elevation.

638
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:54,060
So what happens a theses that is initiated is negated example Ptolemy's geocentric

639
00:59:54,060 --> 01:00:00,180
view is negated it is not Ptolemy we can put it in this way symbolically Ptolemy and not

640
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:08,140
Ptolemy by the Ptolemy's view by virtue of being a finite assertion a partial assertion

641
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:12,780
generates its own antithesis automatically generates its own antithesis.

642
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:19,540
Now the synthesis preserves both the theses and antithesis in Copernican view Ptolemy's

643
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,980
preserved in terms of being what made the former possible Copernican view was possible

644
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:32,820
or rather Copernicus even conceived of such a problem because of Ptolemy and not Ptolemy

645
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:39,180
because of the theses and the antithesis which was initially initiated the synthesis

646
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:42,100
was made possible because of the theses and antithesis.

647
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:49,660
So in that sense it is not only negated but also preserved and then there is another stage

648
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:57,460
that synthesis also elevates as the new account is superior to both the theses and the antithesis.

649
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:06,540
So in that sense the dialectical process involves these three stages negation preservation and

650
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,540
elevation.

651
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:12,380
We will discuss these aspects and some of the other details relating to these aspects

652
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:17,940
and some of the other important dimensions of this dialectical method in the next lecture

653
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:23,540
where we will also be examining the concept of spirit the phenomenology of spirit in a

654
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,100
different way.

655
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:27,740
So we will wind up this lecture here thank you.

656
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,540
