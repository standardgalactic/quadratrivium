00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
Welcome to this lecture on aspects of western philosophy module 24 and also lecture number

00:16.320 --> 00:24.120
24. This lecture is going to be on the philosophy of one of the very important thinkers of

00:24.120 --> 00:33.560
western philosophy Hegel. And we would focus on the following topics in this lecture.

00:33.560 --> 00:40.400
We will first of all see the concept of Geist or spirit, mind, it is translated in various

00:40.400 --> 00:46.720
ways. Then we will concentrate on this method of dialectics or rather we would conclude

00:46.720 --> 00:52.560
this lecture with that in between we will discuss the concepts of being, non-being and

00:52.560 --> 00:57.680
becoming. They are all interconnected notions in Hegelian philosophy.

00:57.680 --> 01:03.640
Well, when we talk about the importance of a philosopher in the history of philosophy,

01:03.640 --> 01:10.160
normally we consider two criteria. Number one, the contributions he or she had made

01:10.160 --> 01:17.040
to the history of philosophy and number two, the contemporary relevance of these thinkers.

01:17.040 --> 01:21.440
So, in that sense we can see that you know many of these traditional or even ancient

01:21.440 --> 01:27.800
philosophers like Plato and Aristotle are still very important, because even today their

01:27.800 --> 01:33.880
thoughts inspire us, inspire philosophers. But when you try to understand, when you try

01:33.880 --> 01:41.040
to evaluate Hegel in the light of these criteria, I would rather say that both of them, I mean

01:41.040 --> 01:46.680
if you consider both the aspects like the contributions to the history of philosophy,

01:46.720 --> 01:53.480
history of thought and history of human intellectual history, we can put it in that way, the entire

01:53.480 --> 02:00.400
human intellectual history owe a lot to Hegelian philosophy. Hegel has inspired thinkers from

02:00.400 --> 02:06.840
all aspects, all intellectual disciplines and of course, the contemporary relevance

02:06.840 --> 02:10.440
of Hegel. There are many philosophers in the contemporary

02:10.440 --> 02:20.200
world, go back to Hegel's thought, notable philosopher Charles Taylor and many others

02:20.200 --> 02:25.240
and as far as Indian philosophical tradition is concerned, there is a tendency among some

02:25.240 --> 02:31.560
Indian philosophers to compare the Hegelian system of absolute idealism with Vedanta.

02:31.560 --> 02:38.360
So, in that sense Hegel is a very important thinker for us and we will start with concept

02:38.360 --> 02:45.760
of gist or absolute or spirit, but before that let us see some basic details about Hegel.

02:45.760 --> 02:54.480
He was born on August 27th, 1770 and his association with Friedrich Halderin, a very

02:54.480 --> 03:01.680
important poet, German poet and Schelling led him to read and spend more time on the

03:01.680 --> 03:08.280
critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant. So, this association with these two great thinkers

03:08.280 --> 03:15.880
played a very important role in Hegel's philosophy and in Hegel's intellectual development.

03:15.880 --> 03:22.200
Then he published his first major philosophical work, the phenomenology of spirit in 1807.

03:22.200 --> 03:26.040
There are many other works he published during his lifetime, I am not going to mention about

03:26.040 --> 03:33.760
all of them, but the attempt is to understand how a philosopher such a great thinker like

03:33.760 --> 03:39.160
Hegel has actually started his philosophical career and probably in the next lecture we

03:39.160 --> 03:43.560
will concentrate on this whole idea of phenomenology of spirit.

03:43.560 --> 03:49.400
When we talk about the philosophical sources of Hegel, the French rationalism of course

03:49.400 --> 03:55.000
is played a very important role and then comes the British imperialism like all thinkers

03:55.000 --> 04:00.880
of modern enlightenment philosophy or post enlightenment thought. Hegel was also influenced

04:00.880 --> 04:08.320
by the two great traditions of rationalism and empiricism and also Kant, Kant's transcendental

04:08.320 --> 04:14.520
philosophy. Kant being a German, it was quite natural that Kant would have influenced Hegelian

04:14.520 --> 04:19.160
philosophy, Hegel's intellectual growth in a significant manner.

04:19.160 --> 04:24.120
But another very interesting influence on Hegelian philosophy is Romanticism which is

04:24.120 --> 04:28.920
a little condensious, but at the same time we can see that you know Hegel's attempt

04:28.960 --> 04:34.680
to totalize everything or to develop a philosophy, a totalizing theoretical framework owes a

04:34.680 --> 04:41.800
lot to Romantic approach or Romanticism. And another important contribution probably

04:41.800 --> 04:48.280
or influence of Romanticism is visible in Hegel's attempt to spiritualize philosophy

04:48.280 --> 04:53.320
which is little against the kind of prevailing systems or prevailing approaches to philosophy

04:53.320 --> 05:00.440
in the Enlightenment age, because Enlightenment always try to see nature as material, but

05:00.440 --> 05:03.760
we can see that Hegel was trying to spiritualize it.

05:03.760 --> 05:10.920
So we can see in Hegel's philosophy all these trends the rationalism, empiricism, transcendentalism

05:10.920 --> 05:17.560
or critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, then Romanticism all these you know intellectual

05:17.560 --> 05:24.120
developments converge in a unique manner in Hegelian system of thought.

05:24.120 --> 05:29.800
Now when we talk about Hegel's task as a philosopher, he was trying to formulate a

05:29.800 --> 05:36.760
philosophical theory that will reach to infinity. This again a very interesting aspect, because

05:36.760 --> 05:43.960
when you talk about infinity particularly in the backdrop of Enlightenment philosophy,

05:43.960 --> 05:49.280
the critical philosophy of Immanuel Kant, we have already examined in detail that when

05:49.280 --> 05:58.160
Kant discussed the critic of pure reason, he drew a very clear line, he said that it

05:58.160 --> 06:04.320
is impossible to think this side of the line, you can be here, but never try to stretch

06:04.320 --> 06:12.000
it and try to apply the categories of human thinking or rational categories to your understanding

06:12.000 --> 06:17.880
of God or infinite reality or anything. So in that sense, Enlightenment philosophy

06:17.880 --> 06:24.240
drew a very clear line between finite and infinity, something which is finite, something

06:24.240 --> 06:29.440
which human beings with their finite minds can understand and there is an infinite reality

06:29.440 --> 06:37.000
which we can never probably comprehend. So this line is something which Hegel was trying

06:37.000 --> 06:45.360
to cross. Then again formulated totalizing philosophy that comprehends all reality, when

06:45.360 --> 06:50.680
you talk about all reality, I mean it includes all aspects of reality, all phases of reality

06:50.680 --> 06:57.800
not just one. For instance, for Enlightenment reality is constitutive of the material domain,

06:57.800 --> 07:04.200
rather ultimate real is something which is unknowable according to Kantian philosophy

07:04.720 --> 07:11.040
and the phenomenal reality is something which is confined to the domains of percepts and

07:11.040 --> 07:18.880
concepts. So it is basically talks about scientific understanding, but for Hegel history is equally

07:18.880 --> 07:25.760
important like physics. So in one sense we can say that Hegel is historicizing philosophy

07:25.760 --> 07:31.160
or rather is a historian of philosophy, he is definitely not the first historian of philosophy

07:31.280 --> 07:37.800
or first philosopher of history, but Hegel's contributions in this domain, this area is

07:37.800 --> 07:43.680
phenomenal. So in that sense we have to understand this particular standpoint that trying to

07:43.680 --> 07:49.680
develop formulate a totalizing philosophy that comprehends all reality, the historical,

07:49.680 --> 07:56.200
psychological, creative, philosophical, scientific, physical, all aspects of reality into one

07:56.200 --> 08:03.600
system. A philosophy that accounts for all human experience, the totalizing philosophy

08:03.600 --> 08:11.280
that incorporates all knowledge and wisdom, present in science, history, religion, politics,

08:11.280 --> 08:17.280
art and literature are all synthesized in the unique manner in Hegelian system. So in

08:17.280 --> 08:22.080
that sense there are some philosophers, some historians of philosophy would say that Hegel

08:22.080 --> 08:29.080
was the most perfect philosopher, because everything converges into Hegelian system

08:29.080 --> 08:34.280
and the influence of romanticism is quite visible as far as this aspect is concerned.

08:34.280 --> 08:40.280
We will have a brief look at what romanticism is to understand to appreciate Hegelian philosophy

08:40.280 --> 08:46.760
in a more comprehensive manner. It is a new moment in the realms of literature, philosophy

08:46.760 --> 08:52.680
and arts. There are romantic poets, romantic artists who adopted a kind of very unique

08:52.680 --> 08:57.440
and very different approach to nature, the relationship between man and nature, the

08:57.440 --> 09:02.080
importance they have given to experiencing nature, the importance they have given to

09:02.080 --> 09:08.120
emotions. Say for example, people like Wordsworth, the importance given to emotions, passions,

09:08.120 --> 09:13.000
the passionate and experiential way in which you relate yourself with nature, all these

09:13.000 --> 09:20.080
things were emphasized by the romantic thinkers and artists. They advocated by artists and

09:20.080 --> 09:25.720
intellectuals who rejected the enlightenment philosophy dominated by reason, logic and

09:25.720 --> 09:31.760
mathematics. As we have already seen, enlightenment philosophy was dominated by these aspects

09:31.760 --> 09:38.760
reason, logic. For instance, we have seen it in Immanuel Kant, used literature to express

09:38.760 --> 09:43.880
the inner world of human feelings. So, that is what I meant, the world of feelings, emotions

09:43.880 --> 09:50.520
and passions were highlighted by these thinkers. They protest against the domination of science

09:50.520 --> 09:56.280
in culture, highlighted the inability of science in exhausting the complexities of human

09:56.280 --> 10:02.040
experience. Now, for instance, how do you experience a flower? The beauty of a flower,

10:02.040 --> 10:08.480
it is more than just having the perceives and concepts as Kant has mentioned about it.

10:08.480 --> 10:14.400
There is something more than that, you know, you experience is that part of an environment

10:14.400 --> 10:20.440
or being part of that experience, all these things are emphasized by these romantic thinkers.

10:20.440 --> 10:26.000
It misses the totality of experiences and the feelings associated with it and to understand

10:26.000 --> 10:31.680
the world, not science, but experience as it is lived. So, there is a concept of lived

10:31.680 --> 10:38.400
experiences which is emphasized by them and naturally their conception of reality is also

10:38.400 --> 10:43.000
drastically different from the enlightenment conception, where reality is material as I

10:43.000 --> 10:49.480
already mentioned, reality is spiritual. Nature is spiritualized by the romandist which

10:49.480 --> 10:55.040
you can see a trend in Hegel also and nature is not like Newton's mechanical world, but

10:55.040 --> 11:01.280
it is a living spirit which we will find in the conception of geist or spirit in Hegel.

11:01.280 --> 11:07.520
The will is important and not reason, because for the enlightenment reason was the major

11:07.520 --> 11:12.920
tool for understanding the world, but for these romandist it is the will which plays

11:12.920 --> 11:19.560
an important role, which thus justice to the non-rational aspects of human life.

11:19.560 --> 11:24.120
The idea of polarity, human thought and feeling are characterized by a polarity, there is

11:24.120 --> 11:29.880
a two sidedness which again figures in Hegelian philosophy in the form of dialectics, in the

11:29.880 --> 11:35.920
form of contradictions, we will see it later. And again in the pursuit of the infinite,

11:35.920 --> 11:40.760
never get confined to one more of thought which is again Hegelian, Hegel absorbs these

11:40.760 --> 11:46.840
insights, because for Hegel also the whole alone is true, truth is the whole not one

11:46.840 --> 11:53.080
particular concept is only a partial truth, it can never represent the whole of truth,

11:53.080 --> 11:57.840
the whole of truth cannot be represented by one concept of one more of thinking.

11:57.840 --> 12:04.200
So, this is again Hegelian and never be static, with this understanding in the background

12:04.280 --> 12:08.920
let us come to examine some of the important features of Hegelian philosophy.

12:08.920 --> 12:14.840
An observation by Bertrand Russell says that Hegel's philosophy is very difficult, he

12:14.840 --> 12:20.560
is I should say the hardest to understand of all great philosophers, probably that is

12:20.560 --> 12:27.280
true to some extent to a philosopher like Bertrand Russell, who subscribes to the analytic

12:27.280 --> 12:32.160
tradition of philosophy, he is more cance in that way, he is more mathematical in that

12:32.200 --> 12:37.720
for example, Russell we would see later in the course of this lecture series, that would

12:37.720 --> 12:44.040
be appreciating more a mathematical scientific approach to philosophy which Hegel is not

12:44.040 --> 12:47.120
subscribing to.

12:47.120 --> 12:53.000
Hegel's central thought is as I already mentioned only the whole is real, a totalizing

12:53.000 --> 13:00.400
approach this is visible in the concept of the gist or spirit, being the central concept

13:00.440 --> 13:02.480
which unifies everything.

13:02.480 --> 13:11.480
So, Hegel was trying to formulate a concept which could successfully comprehend all aspects

13:11.480 --> 13:18.240
of reality and unifies everything that can be understood and that concept is the concept

13:18.240 --> 13:21.720
of gist or spirit.

13:21.720 --> 13:27.880
All partial facts are abstractions, they have to be brought into connection with the hall

13:27.880 --> 13:29.400
in order to gain validity.

13:29.400 --> 13:35.720
So, this is again a very important Hegelian notion that taking things in isolation is

13:35.720 --> 13:45.440
to abstract them, isolate them from the picture of reality, reality is constituted of the hall.

13:45.440 --> 13:51.520
Reality is hall, the self-subsistence of finite things is an illusion, nothing can exist in

13:51.520 --> 13:55.680
isolation everything is necessarily connected with the rest.

13:56.080 --> 14:01.320
So, this is the essence of Hegelian philosophy in one sense and here Russell says once again

14:01.320 --> 14:08.000
Hegel seeks to demonstrate nothing exists independently of relationships against separated

14:08.000 --> 14:12.280
ness influence of mysticism is visible in this context.

14:12.280 --> 14:17.440
This is according to Bertrand Russell, he interestingly says that here as far as this

14:17.440 --> 14:23.560
aspect of Hegelian philosophy is concerned he is influenced by his early mystic affiliations

14:23.560 --> 14:30.400
because Hegel started his career with I mean he joined a monastery and from there he learned

14:30.400 --> 14:32.160
theology and philosophy.

14:32.160 --> 14:38.120
So, this early affiliation with mysticism would have prompted him to conceive things

14:38.120 --> 14:40.800
in this way this is Russell's opinion.

14:40.800 --> 14:47.680
Now, let us come to Hegel's concept of reality as I mentioned here the stresses on the hall,

14:47.680 --> 14:55.480
the complex system comparable to an organism against Spinoza for whom substance is a simple

14:55.480 --> 14:57.760
or reality is a simple substance.

14:57.760 --> 15:05.960
So, here on the one hand we can see that Hegel was also emphasizing like Spinoza did for

15:05.960 --> 15:12.240
Spinoza also there is only one substance, one reality that is the substance and for

15:12.240 --> 15:19.480
Hegel also there is a kind of I mean he too points to a notion of reality, a notion of

15:19.480 --> 15:24.320
absolute spirit or mind which is universal.

15:24.320 --> 15:32.520
But the difference is that here the reference is to a complex system which is comparable

15:32.520 --> 15:39.680
to an organism as far as Hegelian system is concerned separate things are not an illusion

15:39.680 --> 15:44.640
according to Hegel each has a greater or lesser degree of reality which is not the case with

15:44.640 --> 15:48.480
Spinoza and many others those who are modest.

15:48.480 --> 15:55.280
But for Hegel the separate things the individual things are not illusions and again the reality

15:55.280 --> 15:59.120
of separate things consist in them being an aspect of the hall.

15:59.120 --> 16:04.280
So, at the same time Hegel emphasizes on the importance of the hall.

16:04.680 --> 16:10.640
So, the individual gains its meaning and its significance only in connection with its

16:10.640 --> 16:14.600
being a meaningful part of the hall.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.960
The hall is the absolute.

16:15.960 --> 16:20.560
So, there are concepts these are some of the concepts very important concepts which Hegel

16:20.560 --> 16:27.960
introduces in his philosophy the concept of absolute mind, spirit, geist and there are

16:27.960 --> 16:32.600
several terms which Hegel uses in this context.

16:32.600 --> 16:38.960
And again this reality for Hegel again it is very interesting to note this difference

16:38.960 --> 16:46.080
the difference between the conceptions of reality advocated by Hegel and how he has formulated

16:46.080 --> 16:50.000
it as opposed to the enlightenment conception.

16:50.000 --> 16:55.000
In enlightenment conception for example, the Kantian view of reality the phenomenal world

16:55.000 --> 17:00.120
is a world of cause and effect though this is something which the mind attributes to

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
the world.

17:01.120 --> 17:06.800
It is true we are the law givers according to Kant, but at the same time it is governed

17:06.800 --> 17:12.720
by a cause effect relationship the phenomenal world is governed by a cause effect relationship

17:12.720 --> 17:20.280
which to some extent Hegel also except, but he makes a major deviation here he says that

17:20.280 --> 17:23.160
it is governed by the principle of teleological causality.

17:23.160 --> 17:29.040
So, here he is very close to Aristotle, Aristotle also has a conception of teleology that everything

17:29.040 --> 17:35.480
has a purpose a higher purpose to be realized and there are two principles which are relevant

17:35.480 --> 17:40.280
in Aristotelian philosophy at potentiality and actuality.

17:40.280 --> 17:44.720
And in the process of change according to Aristotle every change is evolution we have

17:44.720 --> 17:49.120
already seen it in one of our previous lectures.

17:49.120 --> 17:53.640
Since every change is in evolution in the process of evolution what happens is that

17:53.640 --> 18:00.320
an object realizes materializes its potentialities or actualizes the potentialities.

18:00.320 --> 18:06.200
So, here again something like that we can see that everything progresses towards what

18:06.200 --> 18:08.200
the absolute according to Hegel.

18:08.200 --> 18:13.480
So, governed by the principle of teleological causality and not just mechanical efficient

18:13.480 --> 18:15.000
causality.

18:15.000 --> 18:22.000
The meaning of each stage is realized in the hall which is the rational and again a revision

18:22.000 --> 18:28.760
of the conception of rationality which is advocated by the modern philosophers by enlarge

18:28.760 --> 18:35.120
and particularly the enlightenment thinkers like Kant to overcome Kantian separation of

18:35.120 --> 18:36.520
Nomina and Phenomena.

18:36.520 --> 18:43.520
Because if you approach reality with the Kantian model then it is impossible to know the Nomina

18:43.520 --> 18:48.000
there is a clear separation as I already mentioned a line is drawn between Nomina and Phenomena

18:48.000 --> 18:52.200
something which you can know and the reality which you can never know.

18:52.200 --> 18:58.280
That is because Kant and the enlightenment philosophers advocated a very peculiar conception

18:58.280 --> 19:02.400
of rationality by means of which reality is comprehended.

19:02.400 --> 19:08.440
This rationality has two aspects I have already mentioned it in my previous lectures the

19:08.440 --> 19:13.320
percepts and concepts with the interaction of these two reality the phenomenal world

19:13.320 --> 19:14.320
is revealed.

19:14.320 --> 19:19.440
But something which lies beyond that the nominal reality can never be known.

19:19.440 --> 19:28.720
But Hegel was consciously making an attempt to overcome this dichotomy to know Nomina

19:28.720 --> 19:35.060
and that is why the principle of teleological causality is important in Hegelian system its

19:35.060 --> 19:37.960
identification spirit as activity.

19:37.960 --> 19:44.960
So reality is being identified as a spiritual phenomena as an activity not as a static thing

19:44.960 --> 19:51.080
but as an activity which comprehends everything even the comprehending mind even the mind

19:51.080 --> 19:54.120
which understands it is also part of that.

19:54.120 --> 20:00.080
So it encompasses everything the conception of reality and then again there we can see

20:00.080 --> 20:05.280
Aristotle's influence where identification of the fully substantial being with spirit

20:05.400 --> 20:08.160
which is in essence is activity.

20:08.160 --> 20:14.660
So here also we can see that reality or the absolute or the spirit the absolute mind is

20:14.660 --> 20:22.360
conceived as an activity as a process which progressively takes us to the reason to the

20:22.360 --> 20:25.400
infinity.

20:25.400 --> 20:30.080
Again things have meaning the process is rational there is a rational order.

20:30.080 --> 20:37.320
So this is another important feature of Hegelian thought that he says that this process by

20:37.320 --> 20:43.360
means of which reality exist reality itself is a process it is not a static entity but

20:43.360 --> 20:50.080
it is a process a dynamic process but this process has a meaning it is teleological and

20:50.080 --> 20:55.080
also it is a rational process it is a process of rational unfolding we can mentioned in

20:55.080 --> 20:56.080
that way.

20:56.080 --> 21:03.280
Hall is like an organism that is rational purposive and with full meaning.

21:03.280 --> 21:07.920
Again the Kantian approach is not suitable to know it because the Kantian approach will

21:07.920 --> 21:14.160
never accept this comprehensive perspective for Kant there is always a separation the

21:14.160 --> 21:19.920
subject and object are different for Kant for Hegel the subject and object can never

21:19.920 --> 21:27.200
be different both are comprehended or both are encompassed by the single reality called

21:27.200 --> 21:28.200
the absolute.

21:28.200 --> 21:34.840
Then again Kantian rationality is insufficient in knowing this process because Kantian

21:34.840 --> 21:39.880
rationality employs the twelve categories of understanding which limits everything to

21:39.880 --> 21:45.200
a certain structure which is provided by the mind transcendental a perception which is

21:45.200 --> 21:49.280
not acceptable for Hegel.

21:49.280 --> 21:53.640
Now let us come to the Kantian problem because we have been discussing about Kant and Kantian

21:53.640 --> 22:00.560
model of rationality a lot let us see what happens here the ego the mind because we have

22:00.560 --> 22:07.440
already seen that Kant was I mean it is being stated that Kant is initiating a kind of Copernican

22:07.440 --> 22:12.880
revolution in philosophy and this Copernican revolution consists in placing the subject

22:12.880 --> 22:18.120
the mind the ego at the center of the knowing activity as I have already mentioned in this

22:18.120 --> 22:23.600
lecture sometime back that we are the low givers of the universe this is the Kantian

22:23.600 --> 22:24.600
position.

22:24.600 --> 22:32.400
Now what is this ego the low giver the ego or mind according to Kant is the condition

22:32.400 --> 22:36.840
of the possibility of things appearing to the subject.

22:36.840 --> 22:41.520
So this is the Kantian position it is a precondition that is why it is called transcendental critical

22:41.520 --> 22:48.720
philosophy because it talks about the condition of the possibility of things appearing to

22:48.720 --> 22:55.520
the subject and again ego is an abstract account of the forms of thought or categories of

22:55.520 --> 22:56.520
understanding.

22:56.520 --> 23:02.840
So Kantian ego can be understood in terms of this an abstract account of the forms of

23:02.840 --> 23:07.520
thought or categories of understanding there are twelve categories of understanding according

23:07.520 --> 23:08.520
to Kant.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.400
Kantian ego can be equated with that the empirical ego can be equated with that and

23:13.400 --> 23:21.440
again reason for in that framework is a faculty of the soul or ego constituted of a combination

23:21.440 --> 23:25.520
of principles forms or rules according to which we think.

23:25.520 --> 23:31.880
So these qualities quantity modality and relations these twelve categories would enable

23:31.880 --> 23:34.520
us to think in a particular way.

23:34.520 --> 23:41.420
So the world as such can never be known but we understand it by attributing certain principles

23:41.420 --> 23:48.160
and laws from our side to it that is the Kantian peculiarity and mind is separated from the

23:48.160 --> 23:52.400
world as I mentioned mind is the low giver of the world.

23:52.400 --> 23:57.360
So it is not only epistemologically different from the world but is also ontologically

23:57.360 --> 24:00.320
different from the world.

24:00.320 --> 24:09.400
Forms of thought from what they are forms of mind from what they are forms of the world.

24:09.400 --> 24:15.960
So Kantian philosophy introduces several such categories there is the mind the domain of

24:15.960 --> 24:22.440
the ego the low giver the forms of thought then there is a world the phenomenal world

24:22.440 --> 24:27.120
what we know and there is a nominal domain of reality which we will never know.

24:27.120 --> 24:33.920
So these are all various aspects of Kantian philosophical systems and again the problem

24:33.920 --> 24:40.280
is that there is a gap between mind and the world.

24:40.280 --> 24:48.540
There is a gap between the mind and the world here which can be better articulated by separating

24:48.540 --> 24:50.640
the phenomena with the nominal.

24:50.640 --> 24:56.920
The nominal reality is constitutive of higher realities which can never be known and the

24:56.920 --> 25:02.480
phenomenal reality is something which is spatio-temporally given to us which we experience.

25:02.480 --> 25:09.880
So this gap between nominal and phenomena is actually the gap between mind and the world

25:09.880 --> 25:15.280
and the problem of the nominal or things in themselves which can never be known.

25:15.280 --> 25:21.480
Things in themselves can never be known again problem of antinomies which we have already

25:21.480 --> 25:28.040
discussed when we try to apply these categories of understanding to the nominal world or entities

25:28.040 --> 25:32.880
in the nominal world reality as such say for example when we try to understand the solve

25:32.880 --> 25:38.280
about which we do not have percepts but we try to categorize it without having percepts

25:38.280 --> 25:44.560
we are ultimately bound to end up with antinomies where you have certain contradictory statements

25:44.560 --> 25:50.640
which apparently both of them seem to be equally valid.

25:51.520 --> 25:57.600
Now Hegel's phenomenology of spirit attempts to give an alternate account of this relationship

25:57.600 --> 26:01.680
and show how that this gap can be overcome.

26:01.680 --> 26:08.400
So this is what ultimately tries to say phenomenology of the mind or phenomenology of spirit which

26:08.400 --> 26:14.240
basically talks about the evolution of the human mind from through several stages to

26:14.240 --> 26:20.280
the ultimate stage where it reaches the absolute or which where it realizes in the absolute.

26:20.280 --> 26:23.880
So this process we will examine in detail in the next lecture.

26:23.880 --> 26:30.320
So it is here with this work Hegel tries to overcome the distinction between nominal

26:30.320 --> 26:34.280
and phenomenal realities.

26:34.280 --> 26:43.000
And when we talk about Kantian philosophy Vizavi Hegelian thought Kant we had seen already

26:43.000 --> 26:49.720
that was influenced by the physical sciences and thinking is confined to the scientific

26:49.720 --> 26:56.800
level that is why he has this model of thinking which is constitutive of percepts and concepts.

26:56.800 --> 27:04.600
Then again contradictions in thinking are inevitable at this level because you have you are limited

27:04.600 --> 27:10.360
to the percepts and concepts and when you are trying to apply this to a world which

27:10.360 --> 27:17.360
is apparently not limited or not confined to any of these constraints then you are bound

27:17.400 --> 27:21.200
to end up in contradictions.

27:21.200 --> 27:25.800
Hegel on the other hand adopts the approach of a historian this is what I mentioned earlier

27:25.800 --> 27:31.120
that there is an approach of a historian historical approach in philosophy.

27:31.120 --> 27:37.000
Thinking as an activity of spirit or reason and not confined to the scientific level and

27:37.000 --> 27:41.280
he rises above contradictions to their synthesis.

27:41.280 --> 27:46.600
So that we will see in the later part of this lecture the concept of synthesis which is

27:46.600 --> 27:51.080
the culmination of dialectical process.

27:51.080 --> 27:55.440
Now Hegel's view of reason we can see that reason is the law according to which being

27:55.440 --> 27:58.800
is produced constituted and unfolding.

27:58.800 --> 28:03.840
He has a very an extremely comprehensive concept of rationality or reason where it is a

28:03.840 --> 28:10.560
law according to which being is produced the entire reality is not different from reason.

28:10.560 --> 28:13.840
So rational and real are one and the same.

28:13.840 --> 28:19.540
So later on Hegel would proclaim really is rational and rational is real.

28:19.540 --> 28:26.040
It is constituted and unfolded in reason and both subjective faculty and objective reality

28:26.040 --> 28:28.080
are constitutive of this reason.

28:28.080 --> 28:32.680
See this is again a very important deviation from the enlightenment conception.

28:32.680 --> 28:37.560
In the enlightenment conception we have seen that there is a subject and the object they

28:37.560 --> 28:43.560
are different from each other and they are constitutive of different realities ontological

28:44.080 --> 28:46.520
different epistemologically different.

28:46.520 --> 28:53.240
But in Hegelian system both the subjective and the objective faculties are constituted

28:53.240 --> 28:54.480
by reason.

28:54.480 --> 28:59.640
See reason according to Hegel is a subjective faculty as the essence and norm of our thinking

28:59.640 --> 29:06.800
or our thought the way in which we think what our thinking itself is and on the other side

29:06.800 --> 29:13.280
it is an objective reality as the essence and law of the evolution of things.

29:13.280 --> 29:19.200
We have seen this whole notion of categories of thinking when we have discussed tension

29:19.200 --> 29:25.800
philosophy and Hegel also was interested in this idea of categories the categories of

29:25.800 --> 29:27.240
human thinking.

29:27.240 --> 29:33.600
But the major difference is that for Hegel these categories of thinking are not just

29:33.600 --> 29:38.960
subjective elements of our thinking as Kant conceived it is it is not just subjective

29:38.960 --> 29:44.440
elements but this categories of thinking are according to him the categories of reason

29:44.440 --> 29:51.920
itself and reason according to him as I already mentioned encompasses comprehends everything

29:51.920 --> 29:53.360
it involves everything.

29:53.360 --> 30:00.880
So in that sense they are the basic law of the universe of reality as such are also modes

30:00.880 --> 30:03.320
of being of the things themselves.

30:03.320 --> 30:10.480
So they are the categories of thinking are not only the subjective elements which we

30:10.480 --> 30:13.120
possess but are also the modes of being.

30:13.120 --> 30:19.800
So he is ontologizing them in one sense we can see not empty frames the categories are

30:19.800 --> 30:25.200
not just empty frames which receive their concerns sorry which receive their contents

30:25.200 --> 30:31.040
from without but are substantial forms that give themselves their own content.

30:31.040 --> 30:38.280
See for instance in Kant these categories are empty frames and Kant himself says that

30:38.280 --> 30:45.560
percepts without concepts are blind and concepts without percepts are empty.

30:45.560 --> 30:52.240
So these categories remain empty if they are not provided with percepts from without but

30:52.240 --> 30:58.640
for Hegel they are not so without by their substantial forms the categories of thinking

30:58.640 --> 31:05.400
are substantial forms that give themselves their own content both the forms which mold

31:05.400 --> 31:12.680
my thought and the stages of eternal creation the categories and here we can see that there

31:12.680 --> 31:18.800
are certain very clear objections raised against Kant's idea of pure concepts in limiting

31:18.800 --> 31:24.840
the number of concepts Kant has said that it is 12 and Hegel opposes this conception in

31:24.840 --> 31:29.280
limiting them to the use of sensory experience Kant would say that sorry Hegel would say

31:29.280 --> 31:35.760
that the categories of thinking should be employed in order to know the hall of reality

31:35.760 --> 31:39.600
and then again in limiting the knowledge gained by the categories to the status of

31:39.600 --> 31:45.000
appearance the division can maintains between phenomena and phenomena.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.120
Phenomenal reality is the only reality which we can know with the help of these categories

31:49.120 --> 31:54.160
and according to Kant these categories these phenomenal reality the phenomenal reality

31:54.160 --> 31:57.480
is a mere appearance reality as such can never be known.

31:57.480 --> 32:05.240
So in that sense Kant has confined limited what we experience to the domain of mere

32:05.240 --> 32:12.000
appearances and he opposes the deduction of categories in terms of empirical enumeration

32:12.000 --> 32:15.360
of pure categories.

32:15.360 --> 32:21.080
So here again we can see categories of thinking there is a distinction are not separate from

32:21.080 --> 32:26.360
but are intimately connected with each other even in Kant and he attempted an a priori

32:26.360 --> 32:32.200
deduction of the categories and empirical enumeration of pure concepts which Hegel opposes.

32:32.200 --> 32:37.360
For Hegel these categories of thinking are transformation of one and the same fundamental

32:37.360 --> 32:42.840
category the idea of being because for Hegelian philosophy in the true sense of the term there

32:42.840 --> 32:48.680
is only one reality which encompasses everything that is the idea of being and not just

32:48.680 --> 32:54.480
empirical enumerations but a real deduction which Hegel aims it and in order to deduce

32:54.480 --> 33:00.520
them in the real sense Hegel wants us to just leave them just allow them to unfold and

33:00.520 --> 33:02.680
observe what is happening.

33:02.680 --> 33:09.000
This point onwards we can try to understand what constitutes Hegel's method.

33:09.000 --> 33:14.600
Number one Hegel was trying to build upon Kant he retains Kant's idea of the primacy

33:14.600 --> 33:18.000
concepts have over sense impressions.

33:18.000 --> 33:23.640
These are important in Kant for Hegel also concepts retain their primacy over sense

33:23.640 --> 33:28.680
impressions but in a very significantly different way.

33:28.680 --> 33:36.320
Again to build upon the romantics extend the use of rational concepts to understand the

33:36.320 --> 33:43.600
vast variety of experience and knowledge in psychology, religion, history, culture, literature

33:43.600 --> 33:44.600
and art.

33:44.600 --> 33:49.520
So, here we can see a merging of Kantianism with Romanticism the Kantian categories which

33:49.520 --> 33:55.600
are rational and the romantic approach of reality as a hall to which incorporates all

33:55.600 --> 34:01.640
aspects of reality psychology, religion, history, culture, literature and art.

34:01.640 --> 34:06.120
And again to construct a new theory of reality a new metaphysics.

34:06.120 --> 34:14.400
So, in this context we can examine the metaphysical task of Hegel it is to bring the vast

34:14.400 --> 34:19.560
reaches of the human spirit into unification in one theory.

34:19.560 --> 34:26.320
So, everything that human spirit endeavors to or everything that the human spirit covers

34:26.320 --> 34:30.640
in compasses to bring them into one theory.

34:30.640 --> 34:35.360
To bring together the totality of concepts used in the vast structures of all knowledge

34:35.360 --> 34:39.520
all the arts and sciences, religion, political thought and history which you have already

34:39.520 --> 34:43.920
seen the totalizing tendency in Hegelian philosophy.

34:43.920 --> 34:50.040
All these aspects of reality are brought under the concept of absolute spirit the Geist which

34:50.040 --> 34:51.040
is rational.

34:51.040 --> 34:58.120
So, in that sense the concept of Geist or spirit or we can even translate it as mind

34:58.120 --> 35:05.520
because the German word Geist means spirit mind or soul and for both spirit and mind

35:05.520 --> 35:11.800
Germans use the word Geist and for Hegel it is both rational and rationally comprehensible.

35:11.800 --> 35:18.000
We can also understand it for Kant there is an important difference here for Kant it

35:18.000 --> 35:22.880
belongs to the domain of ideas which we can never understand.

35:22.880 --> 35:28.840
But here it is both rational and rationally comprehensible in logical structure in natural

35:28.840 --> 35:31.200
science and in historical process.

35:31.200 --> 35:39.720
So, it is the Geist is manifested in all the aspects of life in logical structures in

35:39.720 --> 35:44.200
natural sciences and also in the process of history.

35:44.200 --> 35:53.800
The same spirit the same Geist is manifested to show that thought and the matter of thought

35:53.800 --> 35:54.800
are not separate.

35:54.800 --> 35:59.720
The separation was made by all epistemologists subject and object the epistemological

35:59.720 --> 36:04.400
traditions both rationalism and empiricism emphasize on this distinction.

36:04.400 --> 36:10.160
But Hegel was trying to sort of overcome this to show that thought and the matter of thought

36:10.160 --> 36:17.320
are not separate forms of thought arise historically through the interaction of subject and object.

36:17.320 --> 36:24.920
So, again this interactive aspect is emphasized by Hegel because he is approaching philosophy

36:24.920 --> 36:28.560
from the perspective of a historian.

36:28.560 --> 36:35.080
Psychology as a hall including nature, humanity, history is shaped by and is a manifestation

36:35.080 --> 36:37.240
of Geist mind or spirit.

36:37.240 --> 36:43.080
So, everything every reality every aspect of reality every sphere of reality is nothing

36:43.080 --> 36:47.440
but a manifestation of Geist or spirit.

36:47.440 --> 36:54.640
It exhibits self consciousness or self articulation and the manifestation of the self consciousness

36:54.640 --> 36:59.920
of Geist in psychology, history, religion, drama, art and philosophy.

36:59.920 --> 37:07.920
So, everything every human endeavor the manifestation of this spirit is visible according to Hegel

37:07.920 --> 37:15.440
and in this context he proclaims that the real is rational and the rational is real.

37:15.440 --> 37:20.080
The absolute spirit or God is the ultimate reality.

37:20.080 --> 37:24.760
Reality is a complex totality of rational concepts constituting absolute spirit or

37:24.760 --> 37:30.240
God again the real is the rational and the rational is real.

37:30.240 --> 37:36.640
The totality of thought is absolute and infinite unlike the finite minds of human beings Geist

37:36.640 --> 37:38.240
is the objective mind.

37:38.240 --> 37:43.860
So, here he makes a distinction between the objective mind and the finite subjective minds

37:43.860 --> 37:45.840
of the human beings.

37:45.840 --> 37:52.160
Our minds are finite which tries to understand the infinite mind and this understanding is

37:52.160 --> 37:57.680
possible because our finite the so called finite mind is nothing but a manifestation

37:57.680 --> 37:59.680
of that universal mind.

37:59.680 --> 38:03.840
We are now going to discuss that aspect in the next lecture when we discuss the phenomenology

38:03.840 --> 38:06.180
of spirit.

38:06.180 --> 38:12.600
But the point here to be noted is that reality is a complex totality of rational concepts

38:12.600 --> 38:15.920
constituting absolute spirit of or God.

38:15.920 --> 38:21.760
So, there is nothing else but only this rational structures and here there is a very

38:21.760 --> 38:27.360
interesting quote from Alfred Weber's book he says I quote according to Hegel the common

38:27.360 --> 38:31.680
source of the ego and of nature does not transcend reality.

38:31.680 --> 38:38.000
So, in one sense he advocates a kind of immanence which is Aristotelian it is imminent in it

38:38.000 --> 38:44.560
mind and nature are not aspects of the absolute or a kind of screen behind which an

38:44.560 --> 38:51.280
indifferent and lifeless God lies concealed but its successive modes.

38:51.280 --> 38:57.960
The absolute is not immovable but active it is not the principle of nature and of mind

38:57.960 --> 39:04.200
but is itself successively nature and mind the succession this process this perpetual

39:04.200 --> 39:06.840
generation of things is the absolute itself.

39:06.840 --> 39:12.120
So, everything is included under the notion of absolute.

39:12.120 --> 39:18.440
So, let us discuss Hegel's absolute idealism in this context.

39:18.440 --> 39:23.960
Reality according to Hegel is rational conceptual totality and then integrated and total

39:23.960 --> 39:26.400
structure of conceptual truths.

39:26.400 --> 39:33.360
So, it is the totality of the conceptual truth reveals itself in all areas of human

39:33.360 --> 39:37.640
experience and knowledge which I have already mentioned any aspect of human life you take

39:37.640 --> 39:42.880
any aspect any sphere any domain of human life in all such aspects you know you can see

39:42.880 --> 39:46.520
the manifestation of this absolute.

39:46.520 --> 39:51.800
Reality is rational the vast structure of rational concepts that include all areas and

39:51.800 --> 39:56.880
again the real is rational but not different one what is existent naturally there could

39:56.880 --> 40:02.520
we can ask the question all that exist in friend of us the events historical events

40:02.600 --> 40:07.120
the material things how can you say that they are all rational what he says is what

40:07.120 --> 40:13.720
Hegel says is that when you say real is rational and rational is real the real is rational

40:13.720 --> 40:16.920
but not different from what is existent.

40:16.920 --> 40:23.560
He only says that the rational is the existent object more deeply understood the rational

40:23.560 --> 40:28.480
structures need to be understood for that you have to really go to the depth.

40:28.840 --> 40:35.360
So, a deeper understanding of reality reveals the rational structures of it again the deeper

40:35.360 --> 40:42.840
understanding of the vast realms of physical and organic nature and of society of history

40:42.840 --> 40:48.160
of psychology of everything reveals the rational structures.

40:48.160 --> 40:52.600
Rational concepts are not independent or transcendental apart from the concrete world

40:52.640 --> 40:59.640
like Plato for example, for Plato the rational ideas are independent of it but for him it

40:59.640 --> 41:00.640
is not so.

41:00.640 --> 41:06.960
So, here you can see an aspect of Aristotelianism rational concepts constitute their rational

41:06.960 --> 41:10.520
core of the world of things.

41:10.520 --> 41:17.320
Reality is noble its rational structures are noble since human reason and reality share

41:17.320 --> 41:24.400
that the same rational structure our finite man can know the infinite reality this is

41:24.400 --> 41:29.960
against the Kantian idea the Kantian separation between nomina and phenomena.

41:29.960 --> 41:36.560
The absolute mind incorporates all differences so in that sense the absolute mind is a unity

41:36.560 --> 41:43.760
in diversity because it includes everything even contradictions are part of it.

41:43.760 --> 41:49.880
The absolute reality manifests itself to us in ordinary experience in logic and natural

41:49.880 --> 41:56.760
sciences in psychology politics and history in painting poetry and architecture and in

41:56.760 --> 42:03.560
religion and philosophy all aspects of life everywhere what is revealed what is manifested

42:03.560 --> 42:09.240
is the absolute reality the one and the same absolute reality and its rational structures.

42:09.240 --> 42:13.880
Its rational structures are revealed to us because we also possess that rational structure

42:13.880 --> 42:20.760
our mind has that ability to think this actually takes us to the problem of dialectical method.

42:20.760 --> 42:25.800
The absolute being and logic the absolute being is the common root of the categories

42:25.800 --> 42:33.000
of pure concepts it is the emptiest and at the same time the most comprehensive reality

42:33.120 --> 42:40.080
it is emptiest because it is not anything for example quote and quote it is not quote

42:40.080 --> 42:46.320
and quote something or quote and quote some specific entity which can be determined which

42:46.320 --> 42:53.400
can be limited so in that sense it is empty but at the same time it is most comprehensive

42:53.400 --> 43:00.120
reality because it is everything something which is everything cannot be something that

43:00.120 --> 43:08.760
is a actually the contradiction which later on Hegel results with a concept of synthesis.

43:08.760 --> 43:15.160
The most abstract and the most real the most elementary and the most exalted notion all

43:15.160 --> 43:20.560
our concepts express modes of being and our transformation of the idea of being.

43:20.560 --> 43:26.880
So everything all our concepts all that exists outside everything is a mode of a manifestation

43:26.880 --> 43:34.960
of this absolute reality now what is the nature of being how does being which is everything

43:34.960 --> 43:39.260
becomes anything else this is the problem which I just mentioned something which is

43:39.260 --> 43:44.600
everything the guy is the spirit includes everything it involves everything it encompasses

43:44.600 --> 43:52.120
everything something which is everything cannot be something how can it be something then

43:52.120 --> 43:58.920
virtue of what principle or inner force is it modified into something so that we can

43:58.920 --> 44:06.360
determine what it is how does being which is complete and static initiate movements so

44:06.360 --> 44:14.720
that it can become something see in order to become something there should be a movement

44:14.720 --> 44:21.760
and movement presupposes what a space to move but the concept of being includes everything

44:21.760 --> 44:25.680
and there is no space left even that is also part of it.

44:25.680 --> 44:33.840
So how can you conceive of a movement which would make the absolute something being is

44:33.840 --> 44:40.280
the most universal notion and hence the poorest and the emptiest since it is the most universal

44:40.280 --> 44:48.640
it cannot be anything specific it cannot be anything determinate it becomes totally indeterminate

44:48.880 --> 44:54.000
because it is everything something which is everything cannot be something to be something

44:54.000 --> 45:02.560
it needs to be determined as a thing but being is by definition indeterminate if you define

45:02.560 --> 45:11.600
it or determine it as one thing then it is not everything but being without any determination

45:11.600 --> 45:18.080
is non-being so that is the paradox here on the one hand since being is the most universal

45:18.080 --> 45:24.480
and the most complete it is also for the same reason it is the poorest and the emptiest

45:24.480 --> 45:30.720
in order to become something it has to limit itself which means that it has to cease to

45:30.720 --> 45:37.760
be being since it is being it cannot be something but being without any determination is what

45:37.760 --> 45:45.040
non-being being pure and simple is equivalent to non-being it is both being and not being

45:45.120 --> 45:52.000
both itself and its opposite which is under normal circumstances philosophers consider

45:52.000 --> 45:58.200
this as a paradox this as a contradiction which cannot be entertained because philosophers

45:58.200 --> 46:04.520
or logicians are against such contradictions but Hegel says that wait hold on this is not

46:04.520 --> 46:09.920
the time to say that you know contradictions are to be opposed because contradictions constitute

46:09.920 --> 46:15.840
the very core of reality according to Hegel so here he introduces the concept of becoming

46:15.840 --> 46:22.720
it is both an immovable and barren thing and for that reason nothing or not being because

46:22.720 --> 46:33.600
it is both it becomes something and the contradiction contained in being is resolved in the notion

46:33.600 --> 46:39.960
of becoming or development so there is being and non-being and this contradiction between

46:39.960 --> 46:46.080
being and non-being because this being is at the same time being and non-being a contradiction

46:46.080 --> 46:52.480
and this contradiction involves a tension this tension initiates a movement and as a result

46:52.480 --> 46:58.560
the contradiction contained in being is resolved in the notion of becoming or development becoming

46:58.560 --> 47:05.880
is both being and non-being both are contained and reconciled in the notion of becoming so

47:05.880 --> 47:12.140
as a result what happens something else evolves it becomes something and when it becomes something

47:12.140 --> 47:16.960
again the problem is that a new contradiction results which is resolved by a new synthesis

47:16.960 --> 47:25.520
and so on until we reach the absolute idea so here we can see the notion of dialectics

47:25.640 --> 47:31.760
so Hegel was interestingly proposing that we should reach the absolute through contradictions

47:31.760 --> 47:37.040
contradictions are not something which we should be afraid of or we should completely refrain

47:37.040 --> 47:41.800
ourselves from but contradictions are the very core of reality contradictions are the very

47:41.800 --> 47:47.200
core of human thinking once you approach human thinking once you approach rationality human

47:47.200 --> 47:55.240
rationality and once you approach reality historically this thing would be very clear

47:55.240 --> 48:02.560
this contradiction is reconciled in a unity a synthesis this is what Hegel says and this

48:02.560 --> 48:09.760
is contradicted further and then synthesized is another unity contradictions and unity is

48:09.760 --> 48:15.680
go on disappearing and reappearing in the process of development until resolved in the

48:15.680 --> 48:22.000
final unity of the absolute idea so it is something like you have a contradiction between

48:22.000 --> 48:30.760
two opposing ideas and as a result there is a third idea which is the result of a synthesis

48:30.760 --> 48:38.240
of these two opposing ideas and this synthesis itself forms an idea it asserts something

48:38.240 --> 48:47.120
and automatically generates its contradiction so the thesis then becomes or the thesis automatically

48:47.120 --> 48:53.880
generates its antithesis so you have thesis and antithesis which would generate a synthesis

48:53.880 --> 48:59.960
and once the synthesis is generated the synthesis itself becomes a thesis asserts itself as

48:59.960 --> 49:07.760
a position which generates its own antithesis owing to its limitations and finite nature

49:07.760 --> 49:14.840
anything finite is incomplete so any finite thesis is bound to generate its opposition

49:14.880 --> 49:20.360
or its antithesis and then which would ultimately result in a creative conflict of these two

49:20.360 --> 49:26.840
a contradiction which will generate a synthesis which would again become a thesis synthesis

49:26.840 --> 49:33.480
antithesis synthesis so it goes on and on and finally reaches the infinity or absolute

49:33.480 --> 49:42.560
idea now contradictions exist not only in part but also in the things themselves this is

49:42.560 --> 49:47.480
what Hegel says it is not just confined to human thinking or thought but objects the

49:47.480 --> 49:53.240
world itself the reality itself is composed of or its constitutive of such contradictions

49:53.240 --> 49:59.280
antinomies pointed out by Kant are natural they lie in reason and in reality contradictions

49:59.280 --> 50:05.760
lie in the nature of reason and since reality itself is reason or rational reality is also

50:05.760 --> 50:09.800
bound to be constitutive of contradictions.

50:09.800 --> 50:15.000
Then found in the idea of being is resolved in the notion of becoming so you have concepts

50:15.000 --> 50:22.160
of being non-being and becoming thesis antithesis and synthesis in the process of becoming being

50:22.160 --> 50:28.960
determines itself explains the process of historical development and the development

50:28.960 --> 50:35.200
of human thinking as well the dialectical element in thought and reality the dialectic

50:35.200 --> 50:42.440
is manifest in every phenomena natural organic political and historical.

50:42.440 --> 50:48.640
So in all aspects of life in all spheres of life reality can be seen as a manifestation

50:48.640 --> 50:55.200
of this dialectic it constitutes the moving soul of scientific progress we can see that

50:55.200 --> 51:03.280
a scientist or a scientific theory is being advanced since it is a definite finite scientific

51:03.640 --> 51:08.920
conceptualization it is bound to generates its antithesis its opposition and in that

51:08.920 --> 51:15.120
creative conflict between this thesis and antithesis the opposition the conflict a synthesis

51:15.120 --> 51:20.040
a better a mature theory evolves and in that way science progresses.

51:20.040 --> 51:25.760
So human thinking progresses through dialectical process contradictions are the motive force

51:25.760 --> 51:31.800
of all reality the principle of all moment and of all activity we find in reality and

51:31.800 --> 51:37.720
they are not unthinkable according to Hegel because thinking itself constitute the very

51:37.720 --> 51:45.160
core structure of thinking itself and contradiction is the root of all life and moment because

51:45.160 --> 51:49.880
without contradiction everything would become static everything tends to change or pass

51:49.880 --> 51:55.760
into its opposites without contradictions everything would be dead existence static

51:55.760 --> 52:01.160
externality nothing would be happening but everything would be static without that.

52:01.160 --> 52:06.960
And again it suggests that no single concept represents the whole truth truth is the whole

52:06.960 --> 52:13.560
the position which we began with this lecture that the whole alone is true all concepts

52:13.560 --> 52:16.400
are partial truths.

52:16.400 --> 52:21.720
And when we talk about contradictions and their overcoming truth like rational reality is

52:21.720 --> 52:28.440
a living process constituted by the entire system of concepts nature does not stop at

52:28.440 --> 52:30.280
contradictions but overcomes it.

52:30.280 --> 52:35.680
So what Hegel was trying to argue is that though there are contradictions in nature

52:35.680 --> 52:42.320
in human thinking there are contradictions in reality nature or reality does not stop

52:42.320 --> 52:47.800
with contradictions there is always a tendency to overcome each event of contradiction to

52:47.800 --> 52:50.080
a higher form synthesis.

52:50.080 --> 52:54.600
Then again it encounters a contradiction over there which is again synthesized or which

52:54.600 --> 53:00.760
is again overcome and the process take us to absolute infinity.

53:00.760 --> 53:05.600
The process encounters contradictions and overcome them and resolve all of them in the

53:05.600 --> 53:12.080
absolute reason can capture this moving reality with the application of the method of dialectic.

53:12.080 --> 53:20.360
So the dialectical method which is a method suggested by Hegel to understand this process.

53:20.360 --> 53:26.520
Dialectical method basically suggests that reason is not a static faculty of the human

53:26.520 --> 53:33.600
mind it is a product of our social heritage the historical development of our social group.

53:33.600 --> 53:39.400
So this is where you know the historian in Hegel is relevant in understanding his philosophical

53:39.400 --> 53:40.400
concept.

53:40.400 --> 53:45.480
So he says that reason is the product of our social heritage the historical development

53:45.480 --> 53:51.680
of our social group and reason encounters contradictions and proceed by synthesizing

53:51.680 --> 53:54.120
them in that process.

53:54.120 --> 53:58.560
And dialectical thinking is a process that seeks to do justice to moving living organic

53:58.560 --> 53:59.560
existence.

53:59.560 --> 54:05.120
So this is something which Hegel talks about reality it is not a static entity it is living

54:05.120 --> 54:09.640
dynamic moving reality.

54:09.640 --> 54:11.200
What is dialectic?

54:11.200 --> 54:16.680
Dialectic is a very old philosophical concept which is present in ancient Greek tradition

54:16.680 --> 54:21.760
the pre-socatic thinkers themselves have discussed about it or the element of dialectic is visible

54:21.760 --> 54:23.200
in their thinking as well.

54:23.200 --> 54:27.880
Say for example when ancient Greek thought talked about the theory of four elements earth,

54:27.880 --> 54:33.200
water, fire and air where reality is composed of earth and air which are sort of

54:33.400 --> 54:38.360
contradictory fire and water which are also in opposition.

54:38.360 --> 54:44.840
But these apparently contradicting or opposing elements when they come together they constitute

54:44.840 --> 54:45.840
a reality.

54:45.840 --> 54:50.280
So this conception of dialectic is present even in the thinking of the ancient Greek

54:50.280 --> 54:55.160
philosophers and the history of dialectic Socrates plays a very important role and also

54:55.160 --> 55:01.680
play too because Socrates uses dialectic is employs it the use of argument in order to

55:01.680 --> 55:03.680
make the opponent contradict himself.

55:03.680 --> 55:09.480
We have already examined this in the process of Socrates dialogues what happens is Socrates

55:09.480 --> 55:15.080
persistently raises certain questions and in that process make his opponent contradict.

55:15.080 --> 55:18.240
So the contradictions are exposed in that process.

55:18.240 --> 55:27.240
So you make your own or rather the concepts which you hold as true to contradict themselves

55:27.240 --> 55:32.800
and then realize that there is some problem in it in the whole process of thinking.

55:32.800 --> 55:37.600
But Hegel's concept of dialectic is it is different it is rather richer than any of

55:37.600 --> 55:43.240
the other concepts because he conceives it as a synthesis of opposites.

55:43.240 --> 55:48.840
Every concept we have has limitations and hence will pass over into its opposite a negation

55:48.840 --> 55:49.840
of itself.

55:49.840 --> 55:55.120
So in one sense the contradictions according to Hegel we have already seen is a very principle

55:55.120 --> 55:57.280
the very core of reality.

55:57.280 --> 56:03.240
So in that sense the scope of contradictions of the scope of dialectic is rather infinite

56:03.240 --> 56:04.880
in Hegel's philosophy.

56:04.880 --> 56:10.320
But when it comes to reason he understands it in this way every concept or every proposition

56:10.320 --> 56:17.760
which we assert has its limitations and hence will pass over into its opposite a negation

56:17.760 --> 56:18.760
of itself.

56:18.880 --> 56:25.200
It is a process which consists of three stages or moments thesis, antithesis and synthesis

56:25.200 --> 56:27.040
which I have already explained.

56:27.040 --> 56:32.640
The three moments of dialectic is the dialectical process move from a first stage by proposing

56:32.640 --> 56:33.640
a thesis.

56:33.640 --> 56:41.440
Say for example the entire universe revolved around earth which is a geocentric view of

56:41.440 --> 56:42.960
Ptolemy.

56:42.960 --> 56:52.800
So here a thesis is proposed advocated but since any and every position every concept

56:52.800 --> 57:03.200
or every thinking concept is bound to be partial and incomplete the thesis which is advocated

57:03.200 --> 57:10.400
that the entire universe revolves around earth Ptolemy is bound to generate its own antithesis

57:10.400 --> 57:12.720
which says that this is not true.

57:12.720 --> 57:21.400
It is not true that the entire universe revolves around earth owing to the finite nature and

57:21.400 --> 57:28.120
finite feature of any single proposition or any single concept.

57:28.120 --> 57:30.760
Now there is a thesis and an antithesis.

57:30.760 --> 57:35.960
So the dialectical process moves from a first stage by proposing a thesis.

57:35.960 --> 57:41.920
This moves to a second stage which negates opposites or contradicts the first and thus

57:41.920 --> 57:46.880
initiates an antithesis it is not the case.

57:46.880 --> 57:53.520
And now we have in the history of astronomy Copernicus who proposes a heliocentric view

57:53.520 --> 58:00.680
which is much advanced view a mature view than the geocentric view of Ptolemy.

58:00.680 --> 58:06.520
This opposition is overcome by a third stage in which the opposing stages are synthesized.

58:06.520 --> 58:12.280
The opposing stages of Ptolemy's view and not Ptolemy Ptolemy and not Ptolemy is synthesized

58:12.280 --> 58:14.040
in Copernicus.

58:14.040 --> 58:19.840
So in one sense we can say that Copernican view the synthesis presupposes both thesis

58:19.840 --> 58:24.680
and antithesis antithesis presupposes the thesis.

58:24.680 --> 58:27.440
So all these things are interconnected in that way.

58:27.440 --> 58:32.320
So if you concentrate or if you focus on only one of them you seem to think that this is

58:32.320 --> 58:37.400
that contradiction this needs to be avoided but Hegel would say that this is possible

58:37.400 --> 58:39.080
because of that.

58:39.080 --> 58:45.280
So there is an interconnectedness between these things.

58:45.280 --> 58:51.640
In synthesis a new concept emerges as a higher truth which transcends the theses and the

58:51.640 --> 58:53.800
antithesis.

58:53.800 --> 58:58.000
So the three functions of the synthesis number one to cancel the conflict between theses

58:58.000 --> 59:05.080
and antithesis because between Ptolemy and not Ptolemy the conflict between these two

59:05.080 --> 59:10.920
needs to be cancelled by Copernican view which is much superior to preserve or retain the

59:10.920 --> 59:18.240
element of truth within the theses and antithesis and then the third one is to transcend the

59:18.240 --> 59:22.380
opposition by sublimating the conflict into a higher truth.

59:22.380 --> 59:29.360
So the higher truth is the Copernican truth which is which asserts a heliocentric view

59:29.360 --> 59:32.580
and let us conclude here our discussion on this.

59:32.580 --> 59:38.080
If you examine this process we can see that this process of dialectic of encountering

59:38.080 --> 59:43.140
contradictions and overcoming them of having theses antithesis and synthesis involves

59:43.140 --> 59:47.940
the process of negation preservation and elevation.

59:47.940 --> 59:54.060
So what happens a theses that is initiated is negated example Ptolemy's geocentric

59:54.060 --> 01:00:00.180
view is negated it is not Ptolemy we can put it in this way symbolically Ptolemy and not

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:08.140
Ptolemy by the Ptolemy's view by virtue of being a finite assertion a partial assertion

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.780
generates its own antithesis automatically generates its own antithesis.

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:19.540
Now the synthesis preserves both the theses and antithesis in Copernican view Ptolemy's

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:24.980
preserved in terms of being what made the former possible Copernican view was possible

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:32.820
or rather Copernicus even conceived of such a problem because of Ptolemy and not Ptolemy

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:39.180
because of the theses and the antithesis which was initially initiated the synthesis

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:42.100
was made possible because of the theses and antithesis.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:49.660
So in that sense it is not only negated but also preserved and then there is another stage

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:57.460
that synthesis also elevates as the new account is superior to both the theses and the antithesis.

01:00:57.460 --> 01:01:06.540
So in that sense the dialectical process involves these three stages negation preservation and

01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.540
elevation.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.380
We will discuss these aspects and some of the other details relating to these aspects

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:17.940
and some of the other important dimensions of this dialectical method in the next lecture

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:23.540
where we will also be examining the concept of spirit the phenomenology of spirit in a

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:25.100
different way.

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:27.740
So we will wind up this lecture here thank you.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.540
