Checking alligatorjuice/Retro Commercial - Radio Shack Cell Phones - 1990.txt
 The passage you provided is discussing the common occurrence of people having phones in their cars, which is no longer unusual given the widespread use of mobile devices. It then transitions to a scenario where a phone might leave the carâ€”presumably by being taken out for other uses, like a leisurely lunch with "high-seeds," which could mean important or influential individuals.

The mention of Radio Shack suggests that the retail store was once a reliable source for affordable and portable cellular telephones, keeping people in constant communication. This part of the text is highlighting Radio Shack's role in making mobile phones accessible to a broader audience.

Finally, the passage refers to a merger and mentions that the speaker has been given 500 shares as part of the deal. This seems to be a tangential point, perhaps illustrating how changes in business (like mergers) can affect individuals with shareholdings.

In summary, the text is highlighting the ubiquity of phones in cars and the role of Radio Shack in making cellular telephones affordable and transportable, while also noting a personal connection to a corporate merger through the ownership of shares.
