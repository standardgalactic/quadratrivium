0	5840	So, welcome everyone. I am Charles BÃ©dard. I'll be your host today. I'm a postdoctoral
5840	10860	researcher at Universitat de la Switzerland Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. And today
10860	16720	I have the pleasure to be animating a conversation between Charles Bennett and David Deutsch
16720	23880	on the nature of computation, incompleteness, and mathematics. I'll please ask everyone
23880	30000	who's not David or Charlie to mute themselves so that we don't hear any background, any
30000	37040	noise in the background. So that means that among the Charles, that includes yourself,
37040	47320	right? Yeah, I'll keep myself unmuted, correct. I'll be animating the conversation for around
47320	53440	one hour, and then I'll open it up for the audience to ask questions and jump in. Well,
53440	59520	let me introduce our guests to continue. We have Charles Bennett. He's an IBM Fellow
59520	66960	at the IBM Research and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He has been awarded the
66960	73160	2023 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics for his pioneer work on quantum information.
73160	78720	Throughout his career... Well, not just me. What about David Deutsch? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
78720	84280	I was just thinking because he's with us, so I'll have to come up with him at some point.
84280	88600	So the breakthrough prize was, in fact, shared between Charlie, David Deutsch, so two of our
88600	95960	speakers today, and Gilles Brassard and Peter Schor. So we have two of them with us today.
95960	101360	So throughout his career, Charlie played an essential role in investigating and clarifying
101360	107320	the roles between the links between information and physics. Among other things, he co-invented
107320	112360	quantum cryptography, he set the basis for quantum information theory, he resolved the
112360	118200	Maxwell-Demons paradox, and he developed logically reversible computation. Charlie, welcome and
118200	127520	thanks for being here. All right, good. Glad that's over. Yeah. What was this? So we also
127520	132840	have David Deutsch visiting. I think actually, as Smolkowski solved Maxwell-Demons problem
132920	140840	and people sort of forgot about it for 50 years. Oh, okay, good. Yeah. Thanks for the note. David
140840	145480	Deutsch is visiting professor of physics at Oxford University, a fellow of the Royal Society and
145480	151000	the Institute of Physics. He has also been awarded the 2023 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics
151000	157160	for his pioneer work on quantum computation. David is mostly known for his discovery of
157160	162440	the universal quantum computer and the first quantum algorithm, yet he's also a pioneer
163240	169080	of constructor theory, and he's made significant contributions to the philosophy of science. David,
169080	177000	thank you and welcome and thank you for being here. Thank you. So I'd like to start the conversation
177000	184360	by discussing the theory of computation. Computers are all around us. Their usefulness in day-to-day
184360	189320	life is now evident, but when it comes to computers and the theory of computation,
190120	197960	what makes me the most intrigued is what computation is fundamentally and physically,
198520	204120	and what role does it play in understanding of the world around us? So, Charlie, I'll address
204120	208440	the first question to you, but eventually hopefully this becomes a conversation. So please, David,
208440	212760	if at some point you want to jump in, please feel free to react like you would in a regular
212760	218840	living room kind of conversation. Charlie, what is the theory of computation all about?
220680	232200	Well, I think it's almost, you shouldn't ask about the computation particularly, but the deep
232200	243480	philosophical question is about the relation between mathematics and the physics, or the way
243480	258040	I pose the problem of cosmology is to find a mathematical home for our classical phenomenon.
258920	265720	So a phenomenon is like a genome. It's the set of phenomena that we are, the world that we inhabit.
265720	275960	So this is both a, it's a problem. Mathematics is a structure which we think is absolute and
275960	282760	independent of anything physical, and yet if we, the goal of cosmology, or of science in general,
283320	295480	is to find a mathematical explanation of the world. In other words, to find a part of this vast
296440	306760	structure that is mathematics within which what we see is, is typical instead of surprising and
306760	313960	puzzling. And I think that's why I've gotten interested in cosmology lately, because there are some
314760	325880	some things that seems to be, have been learned by modern cosmology that make, make it harder to,
326760	334440	to feel that we've solved this problem of finding a, a model of the universe within which, within
334440	342280	which what we see is, is, is, is typical. So this is, this touches on the, on the question of the
342280	353480	distinction between what, what is and what could be, and also on the anthropic principle and what,
353480	362840	what questions that some people have, have asked in terms of, of self-locating uncertainty.
363480	371000	And it's, it also gets into a question that's very ancient in mathematics, which is
374440	379800	in, in, in infinity, the nature of infinity. So the, the big, some big problems in cosmology,
379800	386520	I must say, I, I always go and ask Andres Albrecht, because he's been thinking about cosmology for,
386520	394760	for much longer time. And in, in one of the workshops we, we organized, he said, well,
396920	403560	maybe let's take an hour, an hour now and, and wallow in, in, in prior probabilities or prior,
403560	418280	prior, say this is a field where you never can solve anything. And I, I, one of the main things I,
418280	429160	I got from him was the, the, the attitude of beating as, as, as unsatisfied with your own
429160	437960	ideas as you are with everybody else's. So where was I going with this? But so the problem that,
437960	444200	that I said was, what I think we, one way of trying to approach this is just to, to,
446280	452360	to think of, oh, I was saying that infinity is very important. I think we can kind of prove that
452360	463080	if you have a finite world in thermal equilibrium, you get a very boring world with,
464440	471160	with essentially because of the, the Boltzmann brain problem. And so we can get interesting things
472360	478440	in an infinite system, which we can't get in the finite ones, qualitatively different. And
479240	483640	within that, I would say what I'm trying to find out is how,
487400	492760	how permanent disequilibrium can arise and how from disequilibrium,
497160	503640	complexity in the sense of logical depth can arise and how in that, in, in the system that is
503640	514520	doing that, a science can arise. And I don't ask about consciousness directly, because I think it
514520	524360	may be a, a sort of an illusion. So here we have a whole bunch of people who think they're talking
524440	533960	to each other on the screens or in the room, but, and the, the big philosophical, I guess they call
533960	538920	it the hard problem of consciousness of trying to decide what, what it means that we feel conscious.
540680	551240	Maybe is, is, is asking too much. And it would be easier to say, because our consciousnesses are
551240	558840	not independent of one another. We, we, if a person is raised without contact with other people,
558840	565400	they, they don't learn to think the way, the way we do. And Charlie, I know it's not my turn yet,
565400	574680	but can I just say it is infinity an illusion? Well, I think it's, it's, no, I think infinity is a
574680	580280	math, is a mathematical notion. So I, but I think that you need infinity to get the kind of permanent
580280	587160	disequilibrium that you need to, to, to escape the, the Boltzmann brain problem. You may need it,
587160	592920	but you may have another way of doing it. So, so, so in other words, I would say that instead of
592920	601720	saying, asking questions like, what, is it sort of the Copernican principle to it? Is it unusual
601720	608440	that I, that I'm alive at this moment, or that my observer moments are, are typical? I would just
608440	618280	say the, the entirety of, of terrestrial civilization, or the terrestrial,
620200	625800	even larger than human civilization, the terrestrial, the complexity of the terrestrial world
625800	631560	is something that we can look at a little bit more objectively than saying, speaking of consciousness.
631560	636840	And so we can say, well, maybe whales are conscious in a different way. And that's not
636840	644440	quite a scientific question. But, but I think we need to look for a mathematical model within
644440	653240	which, and I think it's has to be infinite, but maybe I'm wrong, within which what we see is,
654440	663480	is, is typical under a kind of anthropic, as weak as, as weakly as possibly anthropic selection.
663800	669800	Okay, and end of speech, at least, that's sort of the reason why you're invoking infinity,
669800	678040	because then you could have fluctuations. Well, if you have infinitely, yeah, I don't, if I just
678040	686440	have an infinity, let's say, like, like, Boltzmann's idea, which gave rise to the Boltzmann bring,
686760	695320	of just an infinite, almost, not, not even, this is before general relativity, an infinite
696680	703160	universe at equilibrium, then you, you get the Boltzmann brain problem, you get the fact that
703160	709320	you can't believe anything that you see. Because everything happens somewhere. And I think this
709320	716600	problem is, is somewhat better understood in the, in the more modern cosmologies.
717800	725960	But I was looking at very simple cellular automata models, in which by making the model in infinite,
725960	732600	and it's, it's dynamics is reversible, you get something that looks like unbounded complexity
732600	740600	that goes on forever, but it only goes on forever because the model is infinite. And it, therefore,
740600	746840	it can never, it can never equilibrate and get boring. I think I got a, I got a picture of it.
746840	755080	I'll see if I can find an example of the model like that. Here's. Okay, so this is a reversible
755080	765320	cellular automaton. And the time goes horizontally, like that. And there's, there's three,
768600	774360	there's three domains here. It's one dimensional automaton. So this is time history. And these,
774360	779800	these differ just by the reversal of black and white. So there's, there's domain, domain boundaries
779880	787160	that, that collide here, producing this, this complicated thing that just goes on forever,
787160	792920	getting more and more complicated. This, this business up here is an artifact because I was
792920	797240	doing it with periodic boundary conditions. And this was the wraparound. It was beginning to
797240	802680	affect it. But if you do it on an infinite model, at Lattice, it gets. So this is the sort of thing
802680	808120	where you can't get this in a finite model. If you do it in a, in a finite system with local
808120	818120	interactions, you get something that's, that looks more like, here, I'll just do it at the beginning.
818120	823880	Yeah. Same model. Yeah. So it gets, it gets interesting. And then if it, if you run long
823880	828760	enough, it just, it's boring. Okay. And I'll stop the screen share. So that's, that's,
830120	836200	that's why I think infinity is important. But that's just maybe I haven't been familiar enough
836200	843480	with cosmology, but I think the cosmologies, I think, let's see what see what Andy says, but
843480	851480	that I think that the, the, the cosmologies tend to be infinite now of also not have to stop sharing
851480	860360	my screen. Where is that? Yeah. Screen sharing stopped. There it is. Good. Okay. I was expecting
860360	865960	Charlie to throw us into cosmology, but to be honest, I didn't expect on question one, we would go
865960	872360	on to cosmology. Thank you, Charlie. I enjoyed it. David, would you like to react? Like, maybe,
872360	876680	maybe you can either react to Charlie's comments and, and how very as reaction. Yeah.
877880	881960	Perhaps you have a, you can backtrack the question and, and, and retake the theory of
881960	887640	computation. Well, I think that I can, I can react and respond to your question at the same time.
888280	895880	Because I think the, where I disagree with, with Charlie would be right at the beginning,
895880	902040	sort of foundation Lee. Oh, yeah. You remember, you should say the three Rs react, respond and refute.
904840	906760	Simultaneously to save time. Yes.
906760	917560	So I'm, if you ask, what is computation? What is computation in the universe? Well,
917560	923640	what are computers? Well, what is that all about? If I was answering that question,
924840	930920	I would have to have universal and universality right in the first sentence somewhere, because I
930920	936520	think that's what it's all about. Computation is physical. You know, I'm sure we can all agree on
936520	945480	that. But I think there is still a hint of the mathematician's misconception in Charlie's
946440	955800	conception of the computation, computers, physics. So I would say that the, the, the
956760	968120	computation exists, universality exists in, in a particular property of the physical universe.
970200	978920	Namely that the physical universe can accommodate machines, which are universal in the sense that
978920	986680	they can be programmed to mimic any other machine if they run long enough and have enough memory.
986680	991400	And for them to have, to run long enough and have enough memory, they have to be maintained,
991400	996920	they, they, they have to have additional memory added. And so there has to be implicitly,
997720	1006200	there is a background of knowledge creation. If, if there is to be a sufficiently powerful
1006200	1012360	computer, like Turing machine or something, then in the background there has to be knowledge creation.
1012360	1018840	Just like, I think I first read this in Charlie's thing, like what would happen if you found a fountain
1018840	1025960	pen on the moon, then it would, it would tell you a massive amount. It would tell you that you,
1025960	1035080	it'd been settled by people from the 19th century. Yes. Yes. Most likely. And it's very, very unlikely
1035080	1041320	that it formed spontaneously. And so the most likely explanation for it would be that there
1041320	1046920	had been a civilization. You could, you could infer a lot about the civilization by, as you say,
1047800	1055160	it's a 19th century type civilization. And, and you can analyze the ink and therefore see what kind
1055160	1063320	of squids they had there. And, and so on. So this, another thing that this
1065320	1071720	illustrates, which you didn't mention, is that there's an intimate connection between emergent,
1072440	1079320	simple emergent properties and simple microscopic quantities. In fact, there are
1079400	1086680	laws about emergent properties. And the laws about evolution and knowledge and so on are among
1086680	1096040	the ones we would use to analyze the origin of this fountain pen. So the, we would, we would,
1099960	1106600	we would gain a lot of knowledge about microscopic information from some macroscopic
1106600	1117800	information and macroscopic laws. Now, so I haven't mentioned mathematics. No, no. And the
1117800	1122680	reason I haven't mentioned mathematics, even though I totally agree that there's a mathematical world
1122680	1129160	that's sort of super infinitely large and that world contains all possible functions and all
1129160	1136360	possible laws and all possible mathematical objects, the vast majority of which we cannot
1136360	1143800	even describe. The ones we can describe are basically the ones that are computable by these
1143800	1154200	machines, which are universal within our universe. So it's no good trying to explain that via
1155160	1161400	what is going to be likely, what you are going to be likely to see, because what is typical,
1162040	1167320	what is probable and so on, that those are all determined by the laws of physics. There is no
1167960	1176440	mathematical notion of probability that applies to physics, unless we have a law of physics saying
1176440	1189080	so. And in some cases we do and in some cases we don't. And even when we do so, and where we do
1189080	1198760	have a probabilistic theory of something, the anthropic principle alone doesn't contain any
1198760	1204120	information about what the laws of physics are. I, this is an argument that I got from Dennis
1204120	1212440	Sharma a long time ago with his reaction to Brandon Carter's famous paper about the anthropic
1212440	1220680	principle. The thing is, if you think of this as how do we fix what the dimensionless constants are,
1222760	1228840	or just the laws themselves, you could think of the laws themselves as being
1228840	1234040	enumerated, like in Solomonov induction, you know, so we have all possible laws and
1235240	1242680	so on. And you ask, given what we see, what is the most likely, that is all
1242680	1250520	inapplicable to fundamental physics, because at least not via the anthropic principle, because
1250520	1255240	if you think of the set of all the class or whatever it is, the set of all
1258840	1263720	universes consistent with something, like something consistent with the fountain pen on the moon,
1263720	1269400	or consistent with what we see, or whatever you want to say, consistent with the existence of
1269400	1281720	computers, almost all of them are on the very near the boundary of that set. They are almost
1281720	1288280	all of, because the larger the dimension of the set, the more of it is contained near its boundary.
1288280	1295720	So, if the only reason why we're here is that we're anthropically selected, then it's overwhelmingly
1295720	1302120	likely that we're going to die in the next nanosecond, or picosecond, I suppose. It depends
1303240	1311000	where the chaos, how fast the chaos is going to come in on us. And since we haven't that theory
1311400	1319880	hereby refuted. So, that's not the way to get the answer. I think the way to get an answer
1319880	1327960	is not to try to derive microscopic properties that will then give you the desired emergent
1327960	1335480	properties. It is to think of emergent laws, which, among other things, will give you microscopic
1335480	1341000	laws, as well as microscopic initial conditions like the ones that produced that fountain pen.
1341800	1349800	You see, Charlie, your example has lived with me for decades, and this has changed me deeply.
1350760	1356040	Well, I was thinking of an ordinary ballpoint pen set, but you put it back at sensory...
1356040	1362680	Oh, it's evolved into a fountain pen in my mind, because of its deep significance.
1363160	1366920	The ballpoint pen would just mean you have a hole in your pocket.
1369640	1374040	It fell out of an astronaut's pocket. It's a likely explanation.
1375320	1381400	For you, David, an example of an emergent law that constrains also the microscopic laws would be
1381400	1383720	there exist universal computers. Yes.
1385160	1389400	Okay. Would you like maybe to expand a bit more, because you've contributed quite significantly
1389480	1394440	to the church-turing thesis. I think there was quite a bit of ambiguity of how we should
1394440	1399400	understand the church-turing thesis, and now you name the physicality of the universal computer.
1399400	1403320	I right away see a link. Maybe it would be good to expand a little bit on that, especially for
1403320	1411960	the audience here. Okay. Well, this is controversial, and I don't think I did. I think it was Turing.
1412760	1423800	So the way the story is usually told is that Turing, Girdle, Church, and Post all came up
1423800	1429240	with the same idea at the same time, all proved the same theorems, basically, although they had
1429240	1436680	different points of view. None of them copied from each other. Although some of them knew about
1436680	1445000	each other, but they kind of converged on a conception. But I think Turing's conception was
1445000	1456120	different. The other three all had the mathematician's misconception. They all thought that they were
1456120	1465000	doing a piece of mathematics, or as Roger Penrose would say, meta-mathematics, theory of proofs.
1465080	1476840	But Turing, the way he solved the Hilbert's decision problem, was to think of a physical
1476840	1485640	model of proof, a physical model, and then argue implicitly, explicitly, that again,
1485640	1499240	is controversial, that that argument is decisive. That is, he thought he was proving,
1499240	1515560	and he almost did prove, that no physical object can escape being part of the Turing
1515720	1522360	universal Turing machine's repertoire. The universal Turing machine is an idealized
1522360	1532120	physical machine. It's really got nothing to do with mathematics. Its physical relationship
1532120	1538760	with the rest of the universe is what he elucidated. Then he said that that solves the
1538760	1544440	decision problem, because we must regard the decision problem itself as a question about
1544440	1551800	the physical world, including mathematicians and so on. That's why he used language like
1552840	1559560	functions that would naturally be regarded as computable. Naturally, I always took that to mean
1560600	1566280	straightforwardly, computable in nature. But when I said that to mathematicians,
1566280	1571560	they howled in rage and said that I'd misunderstood it. Well, if I'd been
1571560	1578040	misunderstood it, that misunderstanding turns out to be the truth, and Turing's writings look
1578040	1586920	exactly like that truth. I think he knew. He just wasn't used to talking about physics.
1586920	1592760	He was a mathematician, but I think he did not have the mathematician's misconception.
1594440	1598760	We're all brought up to have it. We have to free ourselves.
1598760	1601800	How would you say, what is the mathematician's misconception?
1603240	1611400	Well, it's the idea that, well, okay, for present company, I can put it like this.
1614040	1621160	It's the idea that the integers and the logical operations like and or and not
1622120	1630120	are given to us by God. They are the natural things. If you can build some structure or
1630120	1637800	form some conclusion on top of those, then you have proved it. Whereas the real truth is that
1637800	1646520	the integers and the logical connectives and classical rules of inference and all that,
1646520	1657880	they are all given to us by physics alone. There is no underlying mathematical substrate
1657880	1664920	that we can appeal to. If the laws of physics were different, then we could have laws of physics
1664920	1674680	that didn't mention and or and not or integers or real numbers or they could use any mathematical
1674680	1680920	objects anywhere in the mathematical world. But the fact that they don't is a feature of the laws
1680920	1693560	of physics. With this, with this misconception comes some other misconceptions such as, for example,
1693560	1699800	that simplicity is somehow defined independently of the laws of physics.
1700440	1709400	And infinity as well, as I have written, you know, Zeno was puzzled by the fact that there's
1709400	1715480	an infinite number of points between here and the other side of the room. And how come that he can
1716600	1722840	go from one point to another and how come he can do an infinite number of things in a finite time?
1722920	1730840	Well, the answer is that what is finite or infinite physically, its relationship to
1730840	1736440	mathematical finiteness or infinite is a matter for the laws of physics to determine. And they
1736440	1743800	happen to say that this particular infinite thing in classical physics, the continuum,
1744680	1751960	can be traversed, an infinite number of steps of traversing it can be finitely performed.
1752680	1759880	So what can be finitely performed or not or and what conversely what can only be infinitely
1759880	1767400	performed, i.e. can't be performed, is mandated by the laws of physics, not vice versa. So it's
1767400	1774120	physics that tells us the difference between find an infinite, complex and simple,
1775080	1782680	and also probability, which is a sort of scam lodged in the middle of all these misconceptions.
1786040	1792920	The idea that it's a meta misconception, a meta misconception, it's a what, sorry?
1793800	1800360	Meta misconception. Well, no, no, it's a good place to hide a scam.
1800920	1807320	Of the matter. There is simply a misconception that probability is another one of these concepts
1807320	1814600	that we can help ourselves to and we haven't yet invoked any physics. We would like what we see
1814600	1824520	to have at least 0.83 probability, then we won't worry that it's strange. And that invocation
1824520	1832840	of probability we take to be sort of harmless. We don't see that there's a rich world of physics
1832840	1838520	defining what we mean by that. And in the case of probability, unlike the other things,
1839080	1846600	it doesn't even apply to most of the universe or the multiverse. It just applies to very
1846680	1856280	special situations. So there's no excuse for it. Let me just ask a little bit, a clarification,
1856280	1860840	David. If I would have been asked what's the mathematician misconception, in a nutshell,
1860840	1867640	I would have said it's the idea that proof theory is a branch of mathematics. But proof theory is
1867640	1874440	a branch of physics, ultimately. It's given rise to computer science. Computer science has its
1874440	1880680	roots into what our computers are physical objects. Now, the story you just gave us,
1880680	1886520	you started speaking of natural numbers and logical connectors. How can I bridge those two
1887480	1894760	pictures of the mathematician misconception? Well, they are the same, I think.
1896520	1903720	Maybe I'm giving a try and then tell me. Because we typically do proofs with
1903720	1909240	typical logical connectors and that will give rise to somehow our computers so that we end up
1909240	1914200	abstracting our computers with those logical connectors and those integers. And that's where
1914200	1921960	you say that taking this as a way to formalize proof is basically physical because I'm already
1921960	1931240	abstracting my physics of the computation. Yes. I think that's basically what I said.
1934600	1941480	I'm not really used to speaking in mathematical language. So I speak of it in terms of laws of
1941480	1946360	physics. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Now, I was trying to map this, the statement proof theory is a
1946360	1953000	branch of physics. Yeah. So I think probably Turing never said this, but I'm sure if he was here
1953080	1963320	now, he would agree that proof theory is a branch of physics. Yeah. Okay. I have,
1964760	1969160	I found myself agreeing with almost everything you said until you started talking about the
1969160	1974760	mathematical mathematician's misconception, which I don't think Turing would have agreed with you
1974760	1990280	about, and which I think is actually a piece of professionalism. It's an idea that you don't like,
1991400	1995800	but you haven't shown that there's anything false about it. In fact, I think Turing
1996120	2007240	thought more about physics than his contemporaries. But I think he felt that this, the discovery of
2007240	2018680	universality meant that the physics of that we have here could be simulated by a computer.
2019480	2026120	And the physics that might exist in a very different world, perhaps one with a different
2026120	2033400	number of dimensions or one that's not even has a notion of locality, could also be simulated
2033400	2041160	by a Turing machine. In other words, I believe he felt the, he was very aware of physics and he,
2041160	2049240	but he didn't think that different, different parts of the multiverse with, think of the string
2049240	2055320	theory, the vast number of different supposed things that can come out of string theory,
2055320	2061400	of which we might be one, that they would have a different mathematics. He think he would,
2061400	2067240	I think he believed in the universality of mathematics and its ability to simulate physics.
2067240	2073560	So that's where I think that you're even calling it a misconception, is a misconception of what
2073560	2080520	Turing thought and also a, a, a disphemism rather than any kind of refutation. However,
2080520	2085400	almost everything you said at the beginning, I agreed with, I said, I take for granted that,
2085400	2089640	that, that universality of computation, the unsolvability of the problem, which is the same
2089640	2099560	thing, is the, the, the heart of, of what, what the notion of computation is. And that the,
2100280	2105960	the other thing is that, that I also didn't even say because I, I believe it so strongly,
2105960	2112760	is that this, this mathematics, this universal mathematics of, of computation is,
2113000	2121000	is capable of, of simulating physics, not only the physics that we have here,
2121560	2128440	but if you talk to Andreas, if he's still around here, there he is. Yes. In, in many models of
2128440	2135560	cosmology, now imagine that there are, that there are inaccessible parts of the universe,
2135560	2140120	which are no, no less real than ours, except that we'll never hear about them,
2140680	2144840	in which the laws of physics, such as the number of spatial dimensions and the number of temporal
2144840	2153560	dimensions, if you want, and, and, and are extremely different. And in, in almost all of them,
2153560	2158680	universal computers don't exist. They exist physically, but they don't exist. There's nobody
2158680	2164680	there to complain about it or to celebrate it. But they're there. They're like the, the desert
2164680	2171160	areas of, of, of, of the universe. But all of that could be simulated by mathematics. So I don't
2171160	2175240	think there's a, I don't think there's, I don't think there is a mathematician's misconception.
2175240	2183400	There's just the, the idea, which has been around since, since, since Galileo, that, that
2184120	2192040	whatever physics is, is discoverable by experiment and in a model level by, by mathematics.
2192040	2200280	I think that's clearly untrue. If by universe you mean
2202120	2208760	the set of all, or potentially the set of all possible mathematical entities
2208760	2213400	instantiated as physical objects, as you say, most of those would not be
2214520	2220680	simulatable by a Turing machine. No, no, I, no, they all would be simulatable by a Turing machine.
2220680	2226520	Most of them wouldn't give rise to the physical possibility of Turing machine in that part of
2226520	2230680	the universe. For example, I don't think there are a lot of Turing machines in the middle of the sun.
2232440	2240200	But in the space of all mathematical objects, there are objects which solve the halting problem.
2241800	2247480	And that such an object cannot be simulated by a Turing machine. It can, it might, there are,
2247480	2253720	there are also kind of universes where. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I have, yeah. This is in other words,
2253720	2262600	these, these, like the, the, clean the hierarchy of all of these higher level of unsolvable problems,
2262600	2266920	what, what you, the problems that you can solve if you had an oracle for the holding problem.
2268680	2271800	Now, I have an idea that I'd like to run by
2272120	2279720	mathematicians, such as yourself, even these mathematicians, which just as I have been lately,
2279720	2285480	over the last five years, seduced by cosmology. And so think, oh, it must have the answers to all
2285480	2291080	the things I worried about since I was five. Let me try to understand it better. So, you know,
2291080	2297160	you're a mathematician and you said, you've gotten to be so fascinated with physics. All the answers
2297160	2300920	to all the things I'm wondering about in mathematics must be in physics somewhere. Let me learn some
2301480	2307880	physics. Well, anyway, this is an idea that you probably know more about as a mathematician.
2307880	2318280	But when I was writing about the, the, the, the, Chaton's omega number, the holding probability
2318280	2323080	of a universal computer with self-delimiting programs, where if you had this number, you would,
2323080	2330520	you would have an oracle for the holding problem, but it would be at a painfully slow oracle that
2330520	2332440	In other words, in order to answer any question,
2332440	2335840	you would have to run for a busy beaver amount of time.
2335840	2338400	And I said, well, this Oracle would
2338400	2343720	be universal in the sense that it would
2343720	2348240	decide all finitely refutable propositions.
2348240	2352840	In other words, problems such that you
2352840	2356280	can express them with one quantifier
2356280	2358000	over the natural numbers.
2358000	2360800	In other words, there exists a time
2360800	2364000	such that if you run this Turing machine for this amount
2364000	2366840	of time, it halts.
2366840	2374640	And then I speculated that the harder problems,
2374640	2376680	which would involve two quantifiers or more
2376680	2382720	like the twin prime conjecture, might be, by and large,
2382720	2386400	not interesting because not mathematically interesting
2386400	2398760	because they could be decided by a stronger but finitely
2398760	2400560	refutable proposition.
2400560	2403400	In other words, instead of saying there are infinitely
2403400	2411560	many twin primes, you could say that the spacing between twin
2411560	2419400	primes grows more rapidly or more slowly
2419400	2420440	than a certain function.
2420440	2422880	So in other words, one of the quantifiers,
2422880	2424800	something that has more than one quantifier,
2424800	2430520	might turn out to be a consequence of something
2430520	2432080	that has only one quantifier.
2432080	2435840	So what you're feeling about when you say natural
2435840	2439920	in mathematics, maybe these things that
2439960	2444840	are harder than the halting problem are just kind of boring
2444840	2447440	because probably most of them would be, what do I mean?
2447440	2450920	By probably, I'm invoking your scam of probability.
2450920	2453360	Probably most of them would be decided
2453360	2455040	as cases of the halting problem.
2458960	2460800	I was sure for most of what you've just said
2460800	2462000	that you were addressing, Charles,
2462000	2464600	because I'm certainly not a mathematician.
2464600	2467040	Them's fighting words, you know.
2467040	2468560	Oh, OK, OK.
2469120	2473040	If you have an idea, if you have a tentative answer,
2473040	2473840	David, go for it.
2473840	2475680	But I also thought about it.
2475680	2476280	I know exactly.
2476280	2476800	Go ahead.
2476800	2477280	No, no.
2477280	2478000	Yeah, OK.
2478000	2479840	I'm sorry, I almost said that at the point.
2479840	2482960	I think that your case, I remember that piece, Charlie,
2482960	2487080	you wrote, in which you say that you specifically
2487080	2489520	spoke about the twin prime conjecture.
2489520	2492280	But was that naturally carried over
2492280	2497000	to higher elements of the arithmetic hierarchy?
2497040	2499280	I think so, because if you're saying,
2499280	2503520	if you bound these quantifiers, you can make them go away.
2503520	2505720	And if a bound exists, it could be
2505720	2510480	that there's a proposition that decides the twin prime conjecture
2510480	2513800	by proving a stronger conjecture that is just
2513800	2516760	of the same form as a halting problem.
2516760	2517560	Yeah.
2517560	2519840	And if you had three or four quantifiers,
2519840	2521880	it could same thing, I believe the same thing could happen.
2521880	2523080	I didn't think anything.
2523080	2528800	And what if the, OK, so another sort of possible glitch
2528800	2532160	that I see is, if the spacing in the twin prime conjecture
2532160	2536760	scales, suppose, larger than busy beaver,
2536760	2538960	then no algorithm can base it.
2538960	2540160	Oh, yeah, yeah, it could.
2540160	2542760	Yeah, so that's exactly it.
2542760	2547120	In other words, if you say, irrefutable.
2547120	2551920	Yeah, certain things of that sort could exist.
2551920	2556120	So I guess this is like experimental mathematics,
2556120	2558200	except you can't do the experiments.
2558200	2560160	But it just occurred to me.
2560160	2561960	I don't know, has anybody thought about that?
2561960	2564000	How do you decide how plausible it
2564000	2572080	is that one of these higher level conjectures
2572080	2575760	could be decided by a provable.
2575760	2578040	Oh, yes, it's really a futile gesture,
2578040	2580920	because it's like, if I had a solution to the halting problem,
2580920	2583480	then maybe I could solve the twin prime conjecture
2583480	2585480	without doing any extra work.
2585480	2587720	But that's like, if my aunt had wheels,
2587720	2589520	she'd be a trolley car, because I don't
2589520	2591240	have a solution to the halting problem.
2591240	2592840	Yeah, but it might also be that you
2592840	2595560	have a solution to the halting problem, and you still can.
2595560	2597000	And you still couldn't, yes.
2597000	2600360	So how do you compare the likelihood of those two things?
2600360	2601920	And I'm sure something's thought about.
2601920	2603120	And what we mean by likelihood, but yeah.
2603120	2605040	Yeah, shut up.
2605040	2608760	But actually, basically, perhaps we
2608760	2610480	could move on on the topic of incompleteness.
2610480	2611760	And I think you bring it on.
2611760	2616000	I had a bit of a context, maybe, to get people into it.
2616000	2619720	But the incompleteness of mathematics
2619720	2623440	was perhaps we have to start it back to Hilbert, where
2623440	2626880	he was hoping to put into a single formal leximistic
2626880	2630600	theory all of mathematical truths.
2630600	2636000	And Girdel in 1931 basically put an end to this hope
2636000	2639720	by finding a statement that is true and has no proof.
2639760	2642360	But Girdel's statement is self-referential,
2642360	2646960	and it might look like an exotic kind of statements.
2646960	2649160	So it's tempting to think that these kind of statements
2649160	2651480	are an anomaly, and that we can safely ignore them
2651480	2653160	and keep doing proofs and mathematics
2653160	2656680	like we usually would have before Girdel's result.
2656680	2659400	And I assume most mathematicians live their life this way,
2659400	2661000	and I don't blame them.
2661000	2664880	But seen from an algorithmic information theory perspective,
2664880	2667880	notably due to the work of Gregory Chaitan,
2667920	2671720	one of your former colleagues, I believe, Charlie,
2671720	2676040	incompleteness is a much more widespread and inevitable
2676040	2677560	phenomenon.
2677560	2679960	So for one thing, Chaitan's result of incompleteness
2679960	2682920	does not involve self-referential statements.
2682920	2685200	And also, they're usually cast in a way
2685200	2687720	that he comes up with an infinite family of true
2687720	2690200	but unprovable statements.
2690200	2693480	And then he say, oh, I will enlarge my formal leximistic
2693480	2696360	theory to be able to prove more of those statements.
2696400	2699800	But by doing so, you only manage to prove finitely more.
2699800	2701560	But you're still in front, regardless
2701560	2703880	how big your formal leximistic theory grows,
2703880	2707400	you're always in front of an infinity of true yet
2707400	2709280	unprovable statements.
2709280	2712480	These are generally the ideas from the algorithmic information
2712480	2715560	theoretic proofs of incompleteness.
2715560	2719080	So yeah, I think algorithmic information theory
2719080	2722360	makes the case for somewhat natural.
2722360	2724560	Incompleteness becomes somewhat natural and actually
2724560	2726080	inevitable.
2726080	2729360	Charlie, would you like to react or comment or expand
2729360	2733360	on the limits of our formal leximistic theories?
2733360	2737680	Notably, I have in mind maybe some
2737680	2739880	of how we should behave with respect
2739880	2742360	to formal leximistic theories in the light
2742360	2744840	of these incompleteness theorems.
2744840	2748400	Chaitan has suggested maybe we should acquire new axioms based
2748400	2751240	on their fertility of the consequences,
2751240	2754040	the problems that they help us solving.
2754040	2756080	To me, there's a striking similarity now
2756080	2758440	between what theoretical physicists do,
2758440	2762280	where they change or update their principles
2762280	2764640	based on the problems that we're care to solve.
2764640	2767760	So do you have any remarks to make on that line
2767760	2769520	of philosophy of incompleteness?
2774720	2776560	Well, I'm more of a physicist.
2776560	2783720	So those are the things that I suggested,
2783720	2788040	which is maybe, I really love computational universality.
2788040	2792800	And the, I couldn't live, this reminds me
2792800	2805200	of what Danny Greenberger said about quantum mechanics.
2805200	2810200	He said, in any god that would know
2810200	2812480	which slit the particle went through,
2812520	2818080	I wouldn't believe in that god of the two slit experiments.
2818080	2825280	So I would say anyone who would like to live in a world
2825280	2830200	that Hilbert wanted to find, I wouldn't want to be friends
2830200	2833280	with that person.
2833280	2839000	In other words, I think that the universality and the dual
2839000	2843840	side to it is the incompleteness is just the way,
2843840	2846040	a beautiful feature of the way world is.
2846040	2848120	It's beautiful in mathematics in the same way
2848120	2854320	that quantum mechanics is beautiful in physics
2854320	2856680	or general relativity.
2856680	2857120	Nice.
2857120	2857480	Thanks.
2857480	2859840	David, what is your take on incompleteness?
2859840	2862080	And it doesn't have to be from the algorithmic information
2862080	2862960	theoretic perspective.
2862960	2865840	Just what are your thoughts?
2865840	2867880	I would agree with what Charlie just said.
2868120	2873320	It's the world that Hilbert envisaged
2873320	2875800	is a world without creativity.
2875800	2880720	And probably ultimately, if you take our world
2880720	2884440	and hobble it down to that level,
2884440	2886560	life could never have evolved.
2886560	2891400	So ours is a world in which life can evolve
2891400	2896960	because there's incompleteness in the mathematics
2896960	2899400	that describe our world.
2899400	2905040	I said mathematics just now as a concession to you all.
2905040	2910000	But what I meant is entirely a physical thing.
2910000	2913280	It's a physical property of the world,
2913280	2919320	which is responsible for the possibility of life
2919320	2925120	and then later, presumably, of intelligence and creativity.
2925120	2936760	And science and of the limitlessness of science.
2936760	2942520	So the illimitability of science is itself,
2942520	2944560	let's put it the other way around.
2944560	2949080	If science was limited, if there was a feature of the universe
2949080	2952960	that limits science in the way that Hilbert wanted
2952960	2955520	to limit mathematics, then there couldn't
2955520	2958120	have been any science in the first place.
2958120	2962720	And this is another one of those connections
2962720	2966000	between what we call emergent properties
2966000	2969200	and what we call microscopic properties.
2969200	2976240	I would like to see a way of formulating the laws of physics
2976240	2980880	that doesn't discriminate between microscopic and emergent
2980880	2982200	laws of physics.
2982240	2987120	A lot of the notorious problems we have,
2987120	2992320	like how to define entropy and the arrow of time and so on,
2992320	2998640	I think are just because we insist that the world must
2998640	3001040	be fundamentally made of microscopic laws.
3005720	3008840	So just to let you all know, constructor theory
3008840	3015720	is an attempt to have a scale independent way
3015720	3019120	of describing laws.
3019120	3021920	I think someone's raised a hand, is that?
3021920	3023920	OK.
3023920	3026400	So you said that if there was anything
3026400	3030880	that limited science in the universe, if science was somehow,
3030880	3033920	if the universe somehow limited the scope of science,
3033920	3039320	then science couldn't have gone the start in the first place.
3039320	3043920	But I can imagine that the observable universe is actually
3043920	3044600	all there is.
3044600	3046800	Beyond the observable universe, there's no matter.
3046800	3048840	There's only space.
3048840	3051600	So there's nothing to help us, I know,
3051600	3053800	form larger and larger computations.
3053800	3055160	So at some point, we reach the limit
3055160	3058760	of what we can do with computers or something like that.
3058760	3062760	And that would still be consistent with us having
3062800	3065440	to do science right now.
3065440	3069840	And I was wondering if you think it's wrong that maybe,
3069840	3073200	even if there's a world without, even beyond the observable
3073200	3076680	universe, there's no matter, that you can somehow still
3076680	3079800	have science that progresses infinitely,
3079800	3082480	or if there's another mistake, or I'm
3082480	3084000	curious about the response to that.
3084000	3084800	Yeah.
3084800	3086280	So I think that is wrong.
3086280	3091400	And it's for exactly the same reason that I was just saying.
3091800	3097160	If we characterize all possible laws
3097160	3103120	as being like our world, but it only lasts a million years,
3103120	3105320	or like our world, but it only lasts a billion years,
3105320	3108360	or then there are lots of possibilities
3108360	3117360	where it would look like our world was the actual one.
3117360	3119720	And similarly for mathematics, you
3119720	3124040	could have, it might be possible for proofs
3124040	3128600	to reach up to a million steps, but no more,
3128600	3131000	because it's so happened that the laws of physics
3131000	3134320	make all computers decay after they have performed
3134320	3135640	a million steps.
3135640	3142160	And there are many more of those worlds
3142160	3145560	than there are what we think the actual world is,
3145560	3147360	with no limits.
3147400	3153440	And that is because that's an illustration of the fact
3153440	3158440	that it's OK.
3158440	3164000	I won't say it's because the limitless one is simpler,
3164000	3166600	because that would be falling into the mathematician's
3166600	3168280	misconception.
3168280	3170760	But I want to say something like that.
3170800	3181200	I want to say that the limitless one is a good explanation
3181200	3184920	in high-level terms.
3184920	3188360	If you try to translate that into low-level terms,
3188360	3191520	you'll get to variations of it, which look like, well,
3191520	3192800	it only lasts a million years.
3192800	3195160	It only lasts two million years, and so on.
3195160	3199960	But at the high level, variations of it
3200000	3205440	are very difficult to find, because you would have to say,
3205440	3211400	OK, proof is limited by what?
3211400	3213920	You would have to have some high-level thing that
3213920	3219120	can fit into the language of talking about proofs
3219120	3225720	and limits and completeness, and so on.
3225720	3227400	So from the point of view of physics,
3227400	3232240	these are all high-level macroscopic constructs.
3235080	3240600	But I think those are the fundamental concepts in which
3240600	3244600	the laws of physics actually are expressed.
3244600	3250200	And because of that, we can say that insisting
3250200	3256040	on describing it all microscopically is perverse,
3256040	3258600	because it's much less simple.
3258600	3262000	But what we really mean is that there
3262000	3264880	are no good explanations along that route.
3267320	3268280	Very good words.
3268280	3269400	Can I summarize?
3269400	3271000	How are we going to speak?
3271000	3273520	The way I understand what you just said
3273520	3275680	is that there's other explanation of,
3275680	3279080	might well be that in some sense, it
3279080	3282280	could be that the universe ends above the observable,
3282280	3283840	that the observable universe is all there is,
3283840	3285480	but that would ruin other explanations
3285480	3288120	that can have, like, face dimensions of how science works.
3288120	3288600	Yes.
3288600	3289100	Yeah.
3289100	3290480	And if you're going to settle for that,
3290480	3292240	you might as well settle for the fairies
3292240	3293680	at the bottom of the garden.
3293680	3296200	We needn't have embarked on this great project
3296200	3299040	of mathematics and physics.
3299040	3299540	Yes.
3303120	3305200	Thanks.
3305200	3308560	David, would you relate the incompleteness phenomenon
3308560	3311440	in mathematics with fallibilism in knowledge creation
3311440	3313200	in general?
3313200	3315120	It seems like you sort of invoked it
3315160	3316560	when you invoked life.
3316560	3319400	Is that the similar idea?
3319400	3322320	Yes, it's, again, a similar idea and for the same reason,
3322320	3330880	that if fallibilism were not true
3330880	3335120	and there were infallible ways of deriving knowledge,
3335120	3338600	then when we have derived some knowledge,
3338600	3340680	it would never change.
3340680	3342400	And it would be true.
3342400	3344760	And the world would be finite, the world
3344760	3349000	would be a representation of that finite piece of knowledge.
3349000	3353760	And conversely, the real situation
3353760	3359280	is that the world is infinitely amenable to knowledge
3359280	3366080	creation, and therefore, it must be infinitely
3366080	3369960	susceptible to errors, which, however, can be corrected.
3369960	3376720	But nothing provides a firm foundation.
3376720	3379760	Not even, and I repeat what I said earlier,
3379760	3384120	not even logic, not even the logical rules of inference,
3384120	3387160	those are all conjectures.
3387160	3389440	We pick them because they seem right,
3389440	3392320	because they seem useful, they seem fruitful.
3392320	3394560	But who knows?
3394560	3397880	We may find new ones.
3398440	3407160	Are you saying that there could be a world in which pi was rational,
3407160	3408960	or a square root of 2, say?
3408960	3414000	Well, of course, that's a fairly simple case.
3414000	3417720	All it would have to do is have a different geometry from ours,
3417720	3419240	not Euclidean geometry.
3419240	3426080	I mean, pi isn't instantiated in the universe anyway.
3426080	3429040	It's an idealization.
3429040	3431120	So if you actually measure a circle,
3431120	3435560	you'll never get pi as the ratio between the radius
3435560	3441040	and the diameter and the circumference.
3441040	3444560	I was thinking of the mathematical pi.
3444560	3447880	Well, there are two different things
3447880	3451160	one might mean by the mathematical pi.
3451160	3453760	Physics allows us a certain window
3453760	3457000	onto the class of abstractions, a tiny window.
3457000	3460280	We can see some of them, we can form theories about some of them,
3460280	3461400	we can learn about some of them,
3461400	3466120	and they include Euclidean geometry with its pi.
3466120	3471720	That pi cannot be changed by anyone, not even God,
3471720	3474480	not even if we look out of a different window.
3474480	3476680	But if we did look out of a different window,
3476680	3478760	thanks to having different laws of physics,
3478760	3481520	or if the laws of physics were not what we think they are,
3481560	3484120	but are a bit different from what we think they are,
3484120	3488960	as happened with Euclidean geometry and general relativity,
3488960	3494160	then we won't find pi out there in the stuff we can look at.
3494160	3499480	We can still describe it, we can describe pi,
3499480	3501880	and we can describe the universe as it actually is,
3501880	3505320	which doesn't have pi.
3505320	3508960	And there will be other ones which we can't describe.
3508960	3511320	We can't describe, but they may have people
3511320	3513720	in them which can describe them.
3513720	3516320	And then there'll be infinitely more,
3516320	3518960	where there aren't people who can describe anything.
3520600	3525480	And be careful to conclude that therefore we don't exist,
3525480	3530480	because that is like the anthropic principle misconception.
3533080	3535280	Just because of misconceptions.
3537400	3540440	I would say the misapplication of the anthropic principle.
3540440	3541680	These places exist,
3541680	3544240	but there's nobody there to complain about it.
3544240	3548080	No, but you want to use it to deduce something
3548080	3549640	about the world we do see.
3551240	3555080	And I don't think the anthropic principle
3555080	3557320	is powerful enough to do that,
3557320	3560320	because it will only, the most it can do is put it on the edge.
3560320	3565320	Yeah, I agree, I want to say something about on the edge,
3565880	3567680	because you reminded me of that.
3567680	3569120	And I don't want to show you a picture,
3569120	3570120	is that okay now?
3570120	3571600	Yeah, sure, go ahead.
3571600	3575200	Okay, so I started worrying about this
3575200	3580200	in terms of the Boltzmann brain problem,
3581360	3583160	which most of you are familiar with,
3583160	3586480	but here's a sort of a summary of it.
3588800	3591720	The New York Times version, from Sean Carroll.
3591720	3593680	This was Boltzmann's idea that the-
3593680	3595280	We don't see it Charlie.
3595280	3596720	Oh, I'll have to stay here.
3596720	3599080	I see it, I don't see why, okay.
3599760	3603120	The reason the universe is out of equilibrium is anthropic.
3603120	3607240	That is that if the universe is infinite and at equilibrium,
3607240	3611280	but we couldn't exist in one of these typical parts.
3611280	3614320	So we're in an atypical part, anthropically selected.
3614320	3618560	But then somebody else, I think it was Edicton said,
3618560	3622160	wait a minute, if that's true, then we probably,
3622160	3625000	most probably are in the smallest fluctuation
3625000	3629040	consistent with our brain existing.
3629040	3634000	And so the idea was that you would get something like this.
3635360	3638400	Where do I go to the next screen here?
3638400	3643400	Yeah, let's see if we go down here, yes.
3646440	3647280	Yes.
3648440	3651520	Okay, so people worried about equilibration
3651520	3653000	and were in the 19th century,
3653000	3654760	they called it the heat death of the universe,
3654760	3656880	but they thought it was a different problem
3656880	3658240	for the distant future.
3658240	3661800	But Boltzmann or Eddington showed it's a problem in the present,
3661800	3664120	undermining our ability to make inferences
3664120	3666880	about conditions in the past or elsewhere,
3666880	3669080	because the inhabitants of any universe
3669080	3670880	that will eventually equilibrate
3671800	3674400	would have to make the additional postulate
3674400	3678080	that they're situated atypically early in its history.
3678080	3683080	Now that gets into David's very nice pointing out that
3683360	3686280	from a Occam's razor point of view,
3686280	3688200	a world that is just like our world,
3688200	3692120	but ends in a second from now
3692120	3694400	or a million years from now
3694400	3696800	has almost as simple a description.
3697880	3700040	So anyway, the Boltzmann brain problem says
3700040	3702240	that if world equilibrates,
3702240	3706360	then almost all places that experience
3706360	3708280	the same phenomena that we have,
3708280	3710000	these are illusory phenomena
3710000	3714240	that don't give grounds for scientific inference.
3714240	3718400	So now there's, this is a little bit like the doomsday problem,
3718400	3723400	which you can argue that the world that has civilization in it
3727840	3730800	is, has only existed for a very short time
3730800	3733080	compared to the time available to it.
3733080	3735800	And why is we so atypically early?
3736960	3740400	Maybe it's because tech civilization
3741160	3744640	is intrinsically unstable, it'll destroy itself.
3744640	3747880	Or maybe there's something that I think David would like
3747880	3749400	is perpetual noonless.
3749400	3751880	That is maybe a billion years from now,
3751880	3753520	there will still be people,
3753520	3755680	but they will be preoccupied
3755680	3759040	that some qualitatively new feature of their existence,
3759040	3762200	which they consider very important, is so new.
3762200	3766560	And they wonder why they are so near the beginning
3766560	3770200	of infinity, as David would put it.
3771920	3775760	So I would like to credit the anthropic principle
3775760	3780200	to Schopenhauer, who really expressed it in the 19th century, 1844,
3780200	3781360	before Darwin.
3783160	3788160	And here he says that the world is on the brink of self-destruction.
3792480	3795160	And we should expect to find it that way
3795200	3799680	because of this surface to volume argument
3799680	3802600	in high-dimensional space that David made.
3802600	3805680	That is that if there are many variables
3805680	3808400	and all of them have to be within a certain range
3808400	3811920	for the world to be habitable or for it to support life
3811920	3814720	or for it to support universal computation,
3814720	3816920	then with the highest probability,
3816920	3818080	we're right near the edge
3818080	3823080	and only a little, very close to self-destruction.
3823080	3828080	And this is Schopenhauer's,
3829600	3832440	he didn't put it in a mathematical terms, but if you did,
3832440	3836520	if he says, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds.
3836520	3838640	In fact, we live in very nearly the worst
3838640	3840480	of all possible worlds,
3840480	3843520	because if we imagine goodness of a world
3843520	3845840	depending on many parameters here too,
3847240	3852040	and we just take everything to lowest order,
3852920	3855240	and the goodness is a quadratic function
3855240	3857880	in the best of all possible worlds is the maximum.
3859120	3861520	And then we find that we're very close to the edge,
3861520	3866120	so we're probably right around the edge here,
3866120	3868040	and therefore we should expect the world
3868040	3870360	to be in the brink of self-destruction
3870360	3872800	as it apparently is politically right now.
3874120	3878040	And so we just have to hope that it survives.
3878040	3881280	Well, that's my comment that I thought
3881280	3883640	had to do with what we were talking about.
3886000	3888440	Yeah, again, I advocate thinking
3888440	3893440	in terms of high-level fundamental laws rather than insisting.
3893480	3896880	How do you discover what these high-level fundamental laws
3896880	3899560	because how do you...
3899560	3901040	Same, well, we already have...
3901040	3903280	Discover them or refute them, yeah.
3903280	3906800	Yeah, the same way that we discovered low-level ones,
3906800	3909480	conjecture, we have a problem
3909480	3911760	that we think might be soluble
3911760	3914800	by postulating a law of nature.
3914800	3918360	And the law of nature seems to answer that problem
3918360	3919720	and many other problems.
3919720	3922000	And so if it doesn't,
3922000	3925080	then we haven't solved the problem yet.
3925080	3930080	And the more it does, the more problems it exposes,
3930960	3932720	which we then solve and so on.
3932720	3936360	Now, we're doing this at many levels already.
3936360	3939600	I mean, there are people who have deep theories
3939600	3942920	about what it takes to win a war
3942920	3945400	and what it takes to make a stable society
3945400	3949940	and what it takes to cure depression and so on.
3949940	3954480	It's just that we have a culture that stigmatizes those
3954480	3958160	from the point of view of being fundamental.
3958160	3961240	So we only expect such knowledge
3961240	3965560	to extend to our own planet, our own time,
3965600	3969480	our own species, if that.
3969480	3974320	You know, we don't think of them as being fundamental,
3974320	3978040	but some of them, like the law of the existence
3978040	3983440	of universal computation is,
3983440	3986400	and the law of increase of entropy for that matter,
3988480	3993480	they are, from a practical point of view,
3994080	3997320	we do regard them as fundamental,
3997320	3999680	like as Eddington or someone said,
3999680	4004320	you know, if somebody tells you that the first law
4004320	4005720	of thermodynamics is wrong,
4005720	4009040	then so much the worst for the theory,
4009040	4012680	but if they say the second law is wrong,
4012680	4015880	then they must retire in deep humiliation and so on.
4015880	4020880	So we do actually have confidence in high level laws.
4021880	4024280	It's just that we have a culture
4024280	4026760	that tells us that those can't be fundamental.
4026760	4030920	We can't kind of infer things about the universe
4030920	4035320	and the big bang and the long-term survival of the universe
4036320	4041320	and bits of the universe that we can't see.
4043200	4045960	This sort of consideration is, you know,
4045960	4050280	it's considered ludicrous to try to talk about that
4050280	4055000	from using concepts like knowledge
4055000	4059080	and even computation and information and so on.
4060520	4062880	Information actually is a bit of an exception
4062880	4066440	because thanks to the mathematician's misconception,
4066440	4069640	people are inclined to think that information is fundamental
4069640	4072040	and everything might be made of bits.
4072040	4076080	But, yes, so, but-
4076080	4080240	So you like bit from it rather than it from bit.
4081240	4082080	Sorry?
4082080	4084760	You like bit from it rather than-
4084760	4086080	Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
4087400	4089960	So that's very much Landauer's,
4089960	4093920	you probably sympathize with what he said.
4093920	4095560	About this.
4095560	4097480	Information is physical.
4097480	4099880	Oh, yeah, well, of course, I thought we all did.
4099880	4104280	I thought that's his great contribution to the world.
4104280	4106600	Wheeler put it the other way.
4106600	4108680	He says physics is informational.
4108680	4111360	Yeah, well, that's a misconception.
4111360	4113720	That obviously can't be right.
4117640	4121800	It's the same thing as expecting us to be in a simulation
4121800	4126200	and the aliens simulating us on a giant computer.
4126200	4127600	And for some reason,
4127600	4130760	people think that that computer has got to be a Turing machine.
4131680	4133520	That's simply a non sequitur.
4133520	4138520	It's just a parochial forcing of a human concept
4141880	4144960	onto imaginary superhuman aliens.
4146320	4150120	You mean you think it might be a machine
4150120	4152120	at the higher level of the hierarchy,
4152120	4153640	which could solve the holding problem
4153640	4156080	and then was worrying about harder things?
4156080	4161080	Yes, although calling it higher level, that's from our-
4161080	4163360	I mean, in the cleaning hierarchy.
4164200	4167080	Which is, again, expressed from our point of view.
4167080	4172080	It could just have different fundamental states
4172320	4174440	and different fundamental operations.
4174440	4177400	So one of its fundamental operations might be
4178280	4181160	to solve the holding problem.
4181160	4186160	Not very slowly, like you're envisaging, but instantly.
4186920	4190240	So you could ask it questions about Turing machines
4190240	4193080	and it could answer all such questions instantly.
4193120	4196440	On the other hand, adding two and two
4196440	4199840	would have it scratching its head for a million years.
4202000	4204400	Probably like Warcase, right?
4205320	4206960	I haven't read it actually.
4207840	4209440	Oh, it's full of things like that,
4209440	4213000	about a guy who remembers everything
4213000	4218000	and is paralyzed by that and about-
4220880	4222880	Oh, right.
4222880	4227800	Well, you can't deny that in the set
4227800	4231160	of all mathematical objects, such things exist.
4231160	4233720	And therefore it is logically possible
4233720	4238320	that physics conforms to that object
4238320	4240720	rather than the objects we think it conforms to.
4242000	4243720	Okay, I admit that.
4243720	4247600	I think I'm going to just disagree with you
4247600	4249840	in a way that we can't prove very easily
4249840	4252600	because Turing is dead,
4252600	4257600	that he would have sympathized more with my view
4258080	4261280	that all the different parts of physics,
4261280	4263480	including the parts of the universe we can't get to
4263480	4265920	because they're beyond the Hubble distance,
4267160	4269360	would be simulable by a Turing machine
4269360	4272680	and wouldn't involve these higher-level things.
4272680	4277120	But seriously, physicists like, remember Hartle,
4277120	4278680	Garrach and Hartle wrote a paper
4278680	4281920	about what would an uncomputable number look like
4281920	4284080	if it was a physical constant?
4285600	4288120	And I think that's certainly a legitimate question.
4288120	4289880	And you're saying that those things,
4292280	4296400	that one aspect of the mathematician's disphemism
4296400	4301400	is that they assume that such things don't exist.
4303360	4306840	Yes, yes, when applied to physics, yes.
4308920	4310880	And I think David was also invoking
4310880	4313440	not just beyond the Hubble distance,
4313440	4318120	but also in a completely different universe.
4318120	4320520	Yeah, well, that's what string theory gives us
4320520	4322160	as far as I understand, Andreas,
4322160	4324480	that there are things where,
4324480	4327480	I guess it's consistent with quantum field theory
4327480	4328760	and general relativity,
4328760	4330880	but things that are just extremely different
4330880	4334280	from anything that we easily imagine.
4334280	4337800	Yeah, you don't even need string theory.
4337800	4340800	I would say the development of theoretical physics
4340800	4344760	keeps pulling us in that direction.
4344760	4346400	And it's hard to truncate.
4347240	4351160	I don't know if it's, you know, right,
4351160	4354720	but the flavor of theoretical physics,
4354720	4357800	yeah, even uncomputable things could be there.
4358920	4360240	I don't think that way.
4360240	4362760	So I don't know how to answer that,
4362760	4367760	but I think one of the fascinating things
4368160	4369440	about cosmology is that
4370800	4372880	physicists pride ourselves in this culture
4372880	4377200	of we only talk about real stuff we can touch and measure,
4377200	4381240	but cosmology really disrupts that.
4381240	4384200	It's really hard to write down theories
4384200	4387760	with the tools we have
4387760	4391040	that allow us to limit ourselves that way.
4392120	4394840	And I'm actually really intrigued by David's angle,
4394840	4399200	which seems to be to take that
4399200	4403360	as a judgment of our ideas about physical laws,
4403360	4406600	if I understand that, which I find fascinating.
4406600	4411040	I've come at a lot of these ideas
4411040	4415320	from the point of view that physics
4415320	4417080	has nothing to do with infinity,
4417080	4419760	because you'll only ever collect finite data
4419760	4422960	and you'll only ever shape
4423920	4428920	the only stuff you have to work with is finite
4429800	4432680	in terms of having finite data and so on.
4432680	4436760	And what I'm hearing, I'm very directly from David
4436760	4439000	and I think implicitly,
4439000	4440400	or maybe directly too from Charlie.
4440400	4443240	Anyway, I'm hearing in both your comments
4443240	4445800	that the problem of the arrow of time
4445800	4447560	or the problem of bolts and brains
4447560	4449360	or however you wanna put it
4449360	4453800	is looming enough to transcend.
4453800	4457640	That's forcing us away from that position.
4460360	4462360	Making us love infinity.
4462360	4467360	Yeah, and I will say that whatever,
4469240	4472520	wherever I am in my prejudices and all of that with that,
4472520	4476760	I think that problem looms so mightily
4476760	4479200	that I have to respect.
4479200	4482640	Even though you're doing stuff that I find uncomfortable,
4483800	4488800	that problem looms so mightily that I respect.
4491360	4492840	It's very radical to me,
4492840	4494440	it's very radical what you're trying to do,
4494440	4496480	but something has to give.
4497800	4500360	Oscar Wilde said, we're all in the gutter,
4500360	4503080	but some of us are looking at the stars.
4503080	4506040	Well, some of us are looking at infinity,
4506040	4509680	because it solves problems here and now.
4511520	4513520	But it seems to me like a cheat.
4513520	4514680	That's, I think that's,
4514680	4516640	so I think you're also giving up.
4516640	4518720	So, and I think you're explicitly saying
4518720	4523240	that you're giving up on the standard ways
4523240	4525240	we think about doing physics.
4525240	4530240	And whether it's embracing some beautiful, better thing
4530760	4533520	or giving up is a little hard for me to tell.
4533520	4536760	We've embraced the continuum for centuries.
4536760	4539480	Yeah, just a derivative that we do in classical.
4539480	4540320	And derivatives, yes.
4540320	4543240	But it doesn't, but it's for, okay,
4543240	4547800	but that's only to make our life easier.
4547800	4551880	And if it were discreet instead, it wouldn't change it.
4551880	4554720	It wouldn't be a radical thing to put it on a lattice.
4554720	4556640	We're not here to make our lives easier,
4556640	4558280	we're here to understand the world.
4558280	4562520	And that's why these continuums and derivatives
4562520	4567080	and all that infinite stuff was invented, was conjectured.
4567080	4569080	And it might be false, but it might not be.
4569080	4571880	Well, you shouldn't have prejudices about these things.
4574440	4577880	But our, yes, that's fine.
4577880	4579640	I like your line.
4579640	4584640	I find the finiteness of physics.
4586200	4590280	Physics is finite, except you're saying,
4590280	4593760	what I'm hearing is, okay, physics might be finite,
4593760	4597120	but except for the arrow of time problem, forcing us out.
4597120	4600640	I don't think the continuum forces us to infinity.
4600640	4601640	We can have a lattice,
4601640	4604520	we can have all kinds of things that do just fine.
4604520	4606360	But you're saying this is the one thing
4606360	4610880	that forces us to think about infinity, which is intriguing.
4612360	4613800	I'd like to go in the audience
4613800	4616920	and give the chance for some students to ask questions.
4616920	4619280	If any one of you have a question.
4621280	4622280	Hi.
4622280	4627280	I'm not sure whether I understood why
4628280	4632280	incompleteness is fundamental for non-equilibrium phenomena
4632280	4634280	and so forth life.
4634280	4637280	I think it was a point of David that he made before.
4637280	4638280	Yeah.
4638280	4642280	So I'd like maybe more comments about that.
4642280	4643280	No, thank you.
4643280	4644280	Cool.
4644280	4645280	Thanks.
4646280	4648280	David, would you like to react?
4648280	4650280	I'm sure Charlie could do this better.
4650280	4658280	But, but I, I, the connection is that if you have to look
4658280	4664280	at the contrapositive, if there is a limitation
4666280	4669280	such as Hilbert imagined,
4671280	4675280	that you can write out an algorithm
4675280	4678280	that will be a criterion of truth,
4678280	4683280	then mathematics has stopped at that point.
4683280	4686280	And the same would be true of physics.
4686280	4693280	If, if, if there was a knowable law of physics
4693280	4695280	that predicted everything,
4695280	4697280	then that would be the end of physics.
4697280	4701280	And if there were such a thing as,
4702280	4706280	and if there were such a thing as life in a universe,
4706280	4709280	which I think there couldn't be, but if, if there were,
4709280	4713280	then it would really mean that the design of the most
4713280	4715280	complicated creature that could exist,
4715280	4718280	which would be finitely complicated,
4718280	4723280	would exist baked into the, to the laws of physics
4723280	4725280	at the big bang.
4725280	4730280	So, you know, the, the, the universe would not have anything
4730280	4734280	that would not have any of the kinds of openness,
4734280	4740280	explain the complexity and the, all the high level structure.
4740280	4749280	If, if it were not, if, if, if there were infallible truths
4749280	4753280	available that the other way around,
4753280	4755280	unless there were fallibility.
4756280	4760280	So, Charlie, yeah.
4760280	4762280	Yeah, I think that's right.
4762280	4768280	That, that is that if, if you didn't have,
4768280	4772280	it's because
4772280	4776280	incompleteness is the flip side of universality.
4776280	4781280	If you had a, if you restricted the,
4781280	4787280	the laws of nature to, to something in which you couldn't
4787280	4791280	produce a universal computer,
4791280	4795280	of course it would be limited by how long it could run before,
4795280	4798280	but basically something that was behaving like a Turing machine
4798280	4801280	until some, some part broke.
4801280	4806280	Then you couldn't get something as complicated as, as, as a,
4807280	4813280	a, a bacterium.
4813280	4815280	Thanks.
4815280	4819280	Are there any other questions from the audience?
4819280	4830280	Yeah, Vincent, would you like to come?
4830280	4833280	So, hello, thank you so much for the great discussion.
4833280	4836280	Maybe I have a question about a bit of a different topic,
4836280	4839280	namely about artificial intelligence and AGI maybe,
4839280	4843280	because some of us are interested in this.
4843280	4847280	So from the Turing church thesis,
4847280	4849280	we know that our brains are not doing anything magical.
4849280	4853280	They could be simulated by a Turing machine, right?
4853280	4855280	So that means, in principle, some,
4855280	4858280	we could implement something like AGI if you,
4858280	4860280	if we would know how,
4860280	4864280	but it could be that the only way, at least in my view,
4864280	4867280	the only way to implement this is to simulate something
4867280	4870280	like a human brain on a Turing machine,
4870280	4873280	not that there's any simple AGI program that does something
4873280	4876280	like human level intelligence or creativity,
4876280	4881280	or maybe there is any reason we might get there,
4881280	4884280	or do you think there is any reason that we should expect
4884280	4887280	a simple program that implements AGI,
4887280	4889280	or is, do we have to take the detour
4889280	4891280	to simulate something like a human brain,
4891280	4893280	and this then...
4893280	4895280	Well, the human brain might be simple,
4895280	4897280	looked at the right way.
4897280	4902280	I think simple doesn't necessarily mean easy to find.
4902280	4905280	I think there is a very strong reason to believe
4905280	4910280	that the explanatory universality property
4910280	4916280	of the human brain, which are present only humans have,
4916280	4921280	must be encoded in a very short amount of DNA,
4921280	4923280	a tiny amount.
4923280	4925280	People have different numbers for this,
4925280	4930280	but we seem to be 95% or 99% of our DNA
4930280	4933280	is the same as chimpanzees,
4933280	4936280	and of the rest, a lot is junk DNA,
4936280	4940280	and of the rest, a lot is differences between us
4940280	4942280	and chimpanzees that aren't connected
4942280	4946280	with these deep epistemological things.
4946280	4952280	So maybe it's only a few K of code in DNA terms
4952280	4958280	that encodes the AGI-ness or the GI-ness of the brain,
4958280	4961280	but that doesn't mean it's easy to find.
4961280	4964280	I would guess that it is a short program.
4964280	4969280	I mean, a few K of program is actually long if you want to write it,
4969280	4975280	but it's relatively short compared with the kinds of things
4975280	4978280	that happen in biology.
4978280	4981280	And I think it'll be very hard to find,
4981280	4985280	and probably, well, I would expect us to find it
4985280	4991280	only once we have understood a philosophical theory
4991280	4993280	of what the function is,
4993280	5000280	what the creativity, consciousness, qualia, and so on,
5000280	5005280	what those things are in some precise terms,
5005280	5009280	precise but high level, I would expect.
5009280	5012280	And then we can probably quite easily write a program
5012280	5015280	that has that property.
5015280	5017280	Then we'll be in various kinds of trouble,
5017280	5019280	but not any of the kinds of trouble
5019280	5022280	that people are thinking about now.
5023280	5027280	I worry that people who know more about it
5027280	5036280	are scared about it, but people are so good
5036280	5040280	at being cruel to each other with their intelligence
5040280	5046280	that I doubt that the machines would do much worse.
5047280	5052280	And I take this Schopenhauer's principle,
5052280	5055280	which is what they should call the anthropic principle
5055280	5061280	pretty seriously, and it may be that we're not likely
5061280	5070280	to last more than a few or decades before we...
5070280	5073280	I don't think that human civilization will extinct itself,
5073280	5080280	it might set us back a few centuries or millennia.
5080280	5086280	And we just hope for the best, but...
5086280	5092280	So that's why I don't worry about it so much,
5092280	5095280	but maybe I should.
5095280	5100280	Oh, I know, it's also, if you want to be universal,
5100280	5102280	not in the sense of computational universality,
5102280	5106280	but in the sense of the Universal Declaration
5106280	5110280	of Human Rights, where do we get off thinking
5110280	5114280	that we have better rights than these machines?
5114280	5116280	They might actually do a better job,
5116280	5121280	or they might be our successors,
5121280	5127280	not in the sense of the ones that conquered us
5127280	5133280	and enslaved us, but in a way that provided a shortcut
5133280	5138280	to what may be...
5138280	5145280	To the bad instincts, or let's say the maladaptive instincts
5145280	5149280	that humans have, and that it might take a bit
5149280	5163280	of very unpleasant natural selection to get rid of,
5163280	5168280	and maybe the artificial intelligence would make a shortcut to...
5168280	5172280	So you're saying AI rights might be better people?
5172280	5175280	Yeah, in other words, another way of doing it
5175280	5178280	would be giving us a transplant of bonobo genes
5178280	5183280	or something that just makes us more susceptible
5183280	5187280	to taking it easy and less susceptible to getting angry
5187280	5190280	at our neighbors because of misinformation
5190280	5193280	we've heard about them and going on killing them,
5193280	5198280	which seems to be the tendency people have,
5198280	5201280	which probably was very adaptive at one stage,
5201280	5207280	but is not helping us right now.
5207280	5208280	Thanks.
5208280	5210280	You can't believe that in the better angels of our nature,
5210280	5213280	and Steven Pinker and all that stuff,
5213280	5216280	he says we've been getting better and better.
5216280	5220280	Look, if civilization...
5220280	5222280	No, that's tendency,
5222280	5225280	but there are also strong tendencies in the other direction.
5225280	5229280	We saw in the 20th century it got pretty bad,
5229280	5232280	and it could do so again.
5232280	5236280	It's worse now because the reach of things
5236280	5239280	is even more global than it was in the 20th century.
5239280	5243280	So a very repressive world government
5243280	5249280	would be harder to dislodge.
5249280	5252280	There's a more fundamental reason why you're right,
5252280	5255280	namely because of fallibilism.
5255280	5260280	There can be no upper bound to the size of error we can make.
5260280	5265280	So although we have the potential
5265280	5272280	to go exponentially into the future at infinite.
5272280	5275280	We have the potential to make arbitrarily large errors,
5275280	5278280	and we may have a dark age and another dark age,
5278280	5280280	and a dark age lasting a million years,
5280280	5282280	or we might wipe ourselves out,
5282280	5285280	and something else might evolve somewhere else in the universe
5285280	5287280	or somewhere else in the multiverse.
5287280	5291280	And there can be no guarantee that that won't happen.
5291280	5294280	There can be no even...
5294280	5298280	There can be no guarantee that it probably won't happen.
5298280	5303280	So what we have to do is solve problems as we find them
5303280	5306280	and create knowledge as we can,
5306280	5315280	and not rely on supernatural guarantees.
5315280	5321280	I thought you'd like that point about the finite bound.
5321280	5326280	Are there any other questions from the audience?
5326280	5330280	Adita?
5330280	5338280	I'm changing chairs depending on which side people come.
5338280	5342280	Hi, so I had a question because of this discussion
5342280	5347280	we spent about discussing about how undecidability
5347280	5351280	and the halting problem are, I guess, flip sides of the same problem.
5351280	5352280	Would you also say that...
5352280	5353280	Universality.
5353280	5356280	Sorry, yeah, universality and the halting problem
5356280	5359280	are the kind of opposite sides of the same problem.
5359280	5363280	Would you also say that these are opposite sides of induction
5363280	5366280	and deduction as ways to kind of acquire knowledge,
5366280	5369280	because we talked about, I guess,
5369280	5372280	Solmanov induction a little bit in the beginning
5372280	5377280	and how maybe that is one conceptualization
5377280	5380280	of how you could derive knowledge from...
5380280	5383280	Instead of using deduction from a formal set of axioms,
5383280	5385280	where you would use data instead.
5385280	5390280	So would you say that the incompatibility of something
5390280	5395280	like ideal induction is the same as not being able to deduce
5395280	5398280	because of incompleteness?
5398280	5402280	Yes, they are both impossible for the same reason
5402280	5406280	and their impossibility is a very good thing for the same reason.
5406280	5411280	So in both cases, instead of deriving things,
5411280	5414280	we have to guess things, we have to conjecture,
5414280	5417280	and the conjectures are always fallible.
5417280	5421280	And I'm spouting Popper's philosophy here,
5421280	5424280	so that's where you have to go for this.
5424280	5429280	And he got an amazing number of things right
5429280	5434280	working almost in isolation.
5434280	5436280	To link to relate to Adita's point,
5436280	5439280	I think also Solmanov's induction is an idealization,
5439280	5441280	and to have Solmanov's metric,
5441280	5443280	one needs to solve the halting problem.
5443280	5445280	But in concrete applications,
5445280	5449280	one cannot find Solmanov's prior.
5449280	5452280	And so what we do, as you know,
5452280	5454280	upper semi-computed perhaps,
5454280	5457280	and then come up with guesses,
5457280	5461280	oh, maybe this phenomenon from which I got these data
5461280	5464280	has been explained by this program.
5464280	5466280	Now everything is programs,
5466280	5470280	but one can come up with this.
5470280	5472280	That's also a problem,
5472280	5475280	how we link scientific explanations with programs.
5475280	5479280	But I think there is a bit of a Popperian flavor
5479280	5481280	in Solmanov's induction once we realize
5481280	5484280	that it's uncomputable, so forget it.
5484280	5486280	It's a beautiful idea.
5486280	5488280	It does converge to whatever it needs to converge.
5488280	5490280	But the fact that it's uncomputable,
5490280	5492280	we can only guess programs.
5492280	5496280	The thing is, usually, or often, shall I say,
5496280	5501280	often the problem we're trying to solve isn't in data.
5501280	5503280	We haven't yet got any data.
5503280	5506280	Sometimes it's a theoretical problem.
5506280	5512280	I think how is it possible for Maxwell's equations to be true
5512280	5515280	and geometry to be what we think it is?
5515280	5518280	There's no data, no data at all.
5518280	5524280	So you have the problem first, then the theory, then the data.
5524280	5530280	And so induction of any kind simply can't exist
5530280	5533280	in that kind of a reality.
5533280	5539280	And as I keep saying, it's a very good thing that it can't.
5539280	5544280	So Solmanov is trying to solve a problem that isn't there.
5544280	5547280	He's trying to say, how can we make this induction
5547280	5552280	or this Bayesian inference or whatever make sense?
5552280	5554280	How can we get the priors right?
5554280	5556280	Well, the priors aren't right.
5556280	5559280	Get over it.
5559280	5566280	Well, my colleague, John Smolen, told me about the story of induction
5566280	5576280	and about an explorer who comes to a place that's inhabited by anti-inductionists.
5576280	5580280	And these are people who believe that if something happened once,
5580280	5583280	it's less likely to happen again.
5583280	5590280	And they have a miserable life because their buildings fall down
5590280	5592280	and their crops fail.
5592280	5598280	And so this explorer says, I understand why everything is not working here.
5598280	5605280	It's because your principle of anti-induction is wrong.
5605280	5607280	And they looked at him and they said,
5607280	5609280	why should we give up this principle?
5609280	5612280	It's never worked before.
5612280	5616280	Nice.
5616280	5617280	Good.
5617280	5618280	Thank you.
5618280	5623280	Thank you so much for your answers.
5623280	5626280	Other questions?
5626280	5630280	Sam.
5630280	5632280	I'm interested in what kinds of cosmology.
5633280	5642280	I mean, we have the cosmology for people like Hitler.
5642280	5644280	There's Barbas cosmology.
5644280	5646280	Let's try to get them again.
5646280	5649280	I'm just curious what interests them at the moment.
5649280	5655280	Well, I don't know a lot about it, but I've been trying to understand these models.
5655280	5660280	They call eternal inflation where there isn't a beginning or an end,
5660280	5666280	but in which there's inflating pockets that appear here and there
5666280	5669280	with all sorts of different natural laws in them.
5669280	5676280	And in that, that's a pretty scary place to live.
5676280	5681280	And it's populated by all kinds of problems, like David mentioned,
5681280	5689280	that it's hard to get a universe in which you're not extremely
5689280	5699280	likely to disappear in a microsecond from now.
5699280	5706280	Other questions from the group?
5706280	5710280	If they come up later, be free to feel free to raise your hand at some point.
5710280	5715280	And at this stage, I could also take questions from the, from the online event.
5715280	5719280	I would have a quick question.
5719280	5721280	Go ahead, Sophie.
5721280	5723280	Yes.
5723280	5730280	I'm wondering when you're talking about other universes that would have maybe
5730280	5733280	they could solve the whole thing problem and for them, it's pretty easy,
5733280	5738280	but for us, it's difficult and vice versa for other tasks.
5738280	5746280	Are you thinking about other branches in the multiverse or something that
5746280	5749280	would be completely outside of what we are studying now?
5749280	5751280	The latter.
5751280	5759280	In the multiverse, there's no, all universes in the quantum multiverse
5759280	5762280	have the same tame mathematics.
5762280	5767280	They even have the same computable functions.
5767280	5773280	They just have different complexity theory, but complexity theory isn't that important anyway.
5773280	5783280	So, yeah, but, but we have to, we have to consider universes with different laws,
5783280	5790280	if only to, to examine explanations like the anthropic principle, which purport to
5790280	5800280	different things in our universe and only, only certain very special kinds of anthropic argument constitute arguments.
5800280	5815280	They, otherwise they, they simply fall victim to this Boltzmann brain or boundary of the, of the set of possibilities problem.
5815280	5834280	In his Sharma, when he was, when he told us about this objection, he said that what we should really look for anthropically is for is a case, not not a case where a slight change in a fundamental law would have meant that we're not here,
5834280	5839280	but where the, but where we are located at the center of the region.
5839280	5850280	So, if we, if we really define structure constant, rather than saying, you know, if it was 1% different, we wouldn't be here.
5850280	5857280	Look at the region where we would be here and, and try to find out whether we're near the center.
5857280	5863280	If we're near the center, that, that is a real anthropic problem.
5863280	5870280	You know, if you tell this to religious people, they're going to say it's God, and it's very hard to argue them out of it.
5870280	5874280	But I don't think we will be in the center.
5874280	5883280	But I think you don't think we're also on the edges, because if we're on the edges, we're out of it right after where we're neither at the center of the edges because that's not where the explanation lies.
5883280	5892280	The explanation of the actual values doesn't doesn't lie in our existence.
5892280	5902280	It's a common cause is caused by things like the law of the, of the universality of computation.
5902280	5904280	I was about to say side effect. Yeah.
5904280	5905280	Yeah.
5905280	5908280	Yeah.
5908280	5913280	Thank you.
5913280	5914280	Are there other questions.
5914280	5921280	We're not at the middle and we're not at the edge exactly how far from the edge are we.
5921280	5931280	Probably a non computable amount or an intractably computable amount.
5931280	5945280	David, I'm just curious. This is a small question, but I'm just curious. So your comments about the thought the sort of unpredictability of the future of our civilization and the possibility of our demise.
5945280	5951280	Is that, is that the same thing as this edge that we've been talking about?
5951280	5953280	Do you see a difference?
5953280	5955280	Yeah, yeah.
5955280	5965280	It's almost the opposite. It's, it's the, it's to do with our fallibility, which is to do with our capacity for infinite growth.
5965280	5966280	Good.
5966280	5969280	That's, that's interesting. Yeah.
5969280	5977280	So it's, it's, it's our hope as well as our possible demise.
5977280	5989280	Well, you know, I'm not expecting our possible demise. I think, you know, arguing that there will be a dis demise is itself not legitimate. That's a prophecy.
5989280	5994280	No, no, no, but, but it's in the scope, but, but it's, it's not.
5994280	5998280	You're saying we can't be sure to avoid it.
5998280	6003280	Yeah, it's, it's on the future of knowledge is unknowable.
6003280	6007280	Again, we've got to get over that.
6007280	6017280	That's, you're saying, unlike other predictions, it's not false survival because if, if, if there is a demise.
6017280	6034280	I think, I think Gilles Brassard was wrote a book on your computation in which it had a cartoon of a bunch of elderly scientists looking into a steaming test tube.
6034280	6045280	And one of them is saying, we may have discovered the elixir of immortality, but it will take forever to test it.
6046280	6057280	Any more questions.
6057280	6061280	I would have another question maybe for Charles.
6061280	6067280	And I wonder what's your view of probabilities.
6067280	6069280	My view of probability.
6069280	6071280	Yep.
6072280	6087280	I think it's just, I think it arises from entanglement.
6087280	6105280	Yes, I think that is the, the problem is, is the feature of a subsystem in a, in a larger system that, that evolves uniterally.
6105280	6116280	My question would also could also be formulated as do you agree with David in terms of what our probabilities, and I guess the answer is yes.
6116280	6125280	Not necessarily because many people view probabilities as entanglement because they understand quantum theory as unitary and so entanglement is out there.
6125280	6132280	But even, even among these people, there's still many disagreements about how we should read the born rule.
6132280	6143280	So, so maybe the follow up question for Charlie without, without being so specific as does it equate to David's, despite you embrace unitary quantum theory.
6143280	6147280	Still, how do you view the born rule.
6147280	6148280	Is it a decision.
6148280	6161280	Yeah, it's, it's, it's hard. I try not to think about it, but I know.
6161280	6165280	Do we have an answer on that.
6165280	6176280	Yes, I think, I think the decision theory approach to probability in quantum mechanics is correct and sufficient.
6177280	6191280	Whether you whether you call that deriving the born rule. I don't know, I think the born rule is a is not a universal rule obviously because it doesn't apply to quantum theory.
6191280	6200280	I mean, it only applies to quantum theory at a tiny minority of of in a tiny minority of situations.
6201280	6209280	In those situations, modeling the, the situation with decision theory.
6209280	6221280	The decision theory theory approach if I can say very quickly is to take decision classical decision theory and quantum theory strip out all the probability from classical decision theory.
6221280	6239280	All the probabilistic axioms and so on. And then quantum theory strip out the probabilistic, you know, if you're going to have wave function collapse or something strip out all that stuff, anything that's supposed to be probabilistic, then smush them together.
6240280	6254280	Consistent quantum theory, namely Everett's, and you get a consistent theory probability, which only applies when people are making decisions.
6254280	6263280	And the rule that they use assuming that they make measurements accurately and all that stuff in that approximation.
6263280	6280280	Their rational behavior as determined by decision theory is the same as it would be if they believed in stochastic processes, even those stochastic processes do not happen in nature.
6280280	6290280	Yeah, that sounds pretty plausible.
6290280	6303280	I'm not sure I properly understood your explanation, David, because if you say you want to get rid of the born rule and you believe in a unitary quantum mechanics and and Everett's many worlds interpretation.
6304280	6320280	How do you reconcile the fact that when we do a quantum experiment in the lab, we, you know, we just get to see one result. How do we, how do we interpret the fact that we're in just a specific branch of the multiverse and say not another one.
6320280	6338280	Why not? We're in all of them. And the fact that we see only one outcome is a prediction of quantum theory. If you if you just write the equation for with the variable for how many outcomes do we see, then you will find that the world after a good measurement, the world will be in an
6338280	6342280	eigenstate of that with eigenvalue one.
6342280	6349280	Okay, so what actually happens is that all of the outcomes happen. I mean, generically.
6350280	6360280	But the question was about probability. What do we then mean that some of them have a high prior probability than others, given that they all happen.
6360280	6373280	Then you have to bring in another part of the model, which is, suppose we were betting on these outcomes. How would it be rational to bet.
6373280	6385280	And decision theory without probabilistic axioms and quantum theory without them together, give the answer.
6385280	6391280	It's magic.
6391280	6398280	You're shaking your head, but if you read the papers, it's, it's, I think it's unanswerable.
6398280	6401280	I mean, it's, it's undeniable.
6401280	6408280	Do you think it's unanswerable or just we haven't found a good explanation for it. Yes.
6408280	6415280	It's too ambiguous at word. I mean, it's undeniable that this is the explanation.
6415280	6425280	So, David has amidst his other euphemisms and disphemisms.
6425280	6451280	And what is, I regard the, the, the most widespread obfuscatory euphemism God, that is, people, people use it to mean their own idea of God, which they're going to try to get you to like and believe in, but they haven't actually said what it is yet.
6451280	6457280	So, I'm going to use that also, but in a physicist's way.
6457280	6470280	So, if you imagine a conversation with God, and, and first of all, you say, what time is it. And God says, well, you would say it's it's about here.
6471280	6482280	It's about 1037 Eastern daylight time. But for me, it's all times. I'm eternal.
6482280	6490280	And then you'll say, well, you're supposed to be omniscient of will it rain a year from now.
6490280	6497280	And God says, well, that's like, yes and no.
6497280	6507280	Well, it rained for me from now. Well, I say, it's like saying what I see is, is something that looks like your hand.
6507280	6515280	And you're sitting here, and you're saying, which of my fingers is the correct extension of my wrist.
6515280	6526280	They all are, when it gets to be next year, you'll either be on one where it's raining, which is the one that has my wedding ring, or you'll be one of the other ones where it isn't raining.
6527280	6547280	And I can see all of them. But, but, and, and you, for you now, they're all equally real. And then in a next year, you will have a kind of a truncated perspective in which you think one of them is real and the others aren't, but they all still are.
6548280	6556280	I'm not going to think that I know that the other branches exist, even if I can't see them.
6556280	6559280	Most things in the universe I can't see.
6559280	6562280	I don't know why that's so, so.
6563280	6578280	It's like this, what Galileo said, he says, I don't know if he actually said this, but he says that it's a yes, I say that the earth moves and if it moves the way I say it is you shouldn't be able to feel it moving so shut up.
6578280	6580280	Yeah, pretty much.
6580280	6583280	Ever said that to do it. Yes.
6583280	6586280	Yeah, yeah, you didn't use the Galileo example.
6586280	6594280	Yes, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. And is that the moment where David started to say, Okay, I don't know what more to argue against.
6594280	6599280	Yeah, that's the moment he was convinced. Yeah.
6599280	6604280	So, so the idea is even the theory says
6604280	6607280	Yes, you will only experience one outcome.
6607280	6608280	Yes.
6608280	6618280	So, even though we seem to be bugged by the fact that no, but the theory says there's going to be many outcomes. No, no, no, it might look like the theory says there's going to be many outcomes.
6618280	6626280	But if, if each of, if you ask yourself what how many outcomes am I going to see the theory says systematically only one.
6626280	6637280	So it preserves its consistency in spite of its striking apparent inconsistency.
6638280	6645280	And are there other questions.
6645280	6648280	Hey, do you hear me.
6648280	6662280	Yeah, so, so will you will you say well any of you say that in that sense, in the sense we just discussed now, the principle will be a statement about consciousness of what do you experience.
6662280	6670280	Or do you think it's beyond like consciousness will be beyond the scope of the statement.
6670280	6687280	It has nothing to do with it. It's, I mean, obviously, if consciousness is to be described as a physical process which it must be, then it presumably a base quantum theory and so on but it has nothing to do with these issues of
6687280	6695280	measurement probability and anything like that it's it's just a physical thing.
6695280	6706280	There's there's no more reason to assume it has a special place in physics, then it would be to assume that squirrels have a special place in physics.
6706280	6714280	Obviously they describe that physics, but they don't have any relevance to fundamental discussions of physics.
6714280	6728280	Well, I asked before, because the idea was like, I mean, the, the following if I'm following the discussion is that, like, you have this different potential outcomes of measurement, all of them occur, all of them have their own branches and all of them are there.
6728280	6733280	But the statement is more like the one do you will experience one of them.
6733280	6744280	And then it's if it's about, you will experience one of them, you will see one of them is wouldn't be addressing directly the consciousness of, or maybe I'm just like going out.
6744280	6762280	It's the same question can be asked about a seed of a plant that grows into two trees, the left one and the right one and you ask the seed are you going to be the left one or the right one or or twins you know you are are you going to be Joe or Fred.
6762280	6773280	You ask the, the fertilized egg. And it says to you, well, in a sense, I'm going to be both of them. In a sense, I'm only going to be one of them.
6773280	6777280	That is to say, I will not experience being both.
6777280	6782280	But the experience of being each of them will both happen.
6782280	6785280	Okay, I see. I understand.
6785280	6789280	That's a good way of putting it. Yeah.
6789280	6795280	Well, David and Charlie have been tremendously generous of their time.
6795280	6806280	It doesn't seems like there's other questions. If somebody has a burning desire and has been repressing his question. This is the last call.
6806280	6808280	It also applies for the audience.
6808280	6810280	Great.
6810280	6823280	Thank you so much, David and Charlie. That was a lot of fun to discuss with you. And it was a very, very fascinating in many regards.
6823280	6828280	Thank you very much. Very, very interesting conversation.
6828280	6830280	Thank you. Hi everyone.
6830280	6831280	Thanks a lot. This was great.
