1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
So, welcome everyone. I am Charles BÃ©dard. I'll be your host today. I'm a postdoctoral

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,860
researcher at Universitat de la Switzerland Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. And today

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:16,720
I have the pleasure to be animating a conversation between Charles Bennett and David Deutsch

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,880
on the nature of computation, incompleteness, and mathematics. I'll please ask everyone

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:30,000
who's not David or Charlie to mute themselves so that we don't hear any background, any

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,040
noise in the background. So that means that among the Charles, that includes yourself,

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:47,320
right? Yeah, I'll keep myself unmuted, correct. I'll be animating the conversation for around

8
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:53,440
one hour, and then I'll open it up for the audience to ask questions and jump in. Well,

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,520
let me introduce our guests to continue. We have Charles Bennett. He's an IBM Fellow

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,960
at the IBM Research and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He has been awarded the

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,160
2023 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics for his pioneer work on quantum information.

12
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:18,720
Throughout his career... Well, not just me. What about David Deutsch? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,280
I was just thinking because he's with us, so I'll have to come up with him at some point.

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,600
So the breakthrough prize was, in fact, shared between Charlie, David Deutsch, so two of our

15
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:35,960
speakers today, and Gilles Brassard and Peter Schor. So we have two of them with us today.

16
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,360
So throughout his career, Charlie played an essential role in investigating and clarifying

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,320
the roles between the links between information and physics. Among other things, he co-invented

18
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,360
quantum cryptography, he set the basis for quantum information theory, he resolved the

19
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:58,200
Maxwell-Demons paradox, and he developed logically reversible computation. Charlie, welcome and

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:07,520
thanks for being here. All right, good. Glad that's over. Yeah. What was this? So we also

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,840
have David Deutsch visiting. I think actually, as Smolkowski solved Maxwell-Demons problem

22
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,840
and people sort of forgot about it for 50 years. Oh, okay, good. Yeah. Thanks for the note. David

23
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,480
Deutsch is visiting professor of physics at Oxford University, a fellow of the Royal Society and

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:31,000
the Institute of Physics. He has also been awarded the 2023 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,160
for his pioneer work on quantum computation. David is mostly known for his discovery of

26
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,440
the universal quantum computer and the first quantum algorithm, yet he's also a pioneer

27
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:49,080
of constructor theory, and he's made significant contributions to the philosophy of science. David,

28
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:57,000
thank you and welcome and thank you for being here. Thank you. So I'd like to start the conversation

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,360
by discussing the theory of computation. Computers are all around us. Their usefulness in day-to-day

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,320
life is now evident, but when it comes to computers and the theory of computation,

31
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:17,960
what makes me the most intrigued is what computation is fundamentally and physically,

32
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,120
and what role does it play in understanding of the world around us? So, Charlie, I'll address

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,440
the first question to you, but eventually hopefully this becomes a conversation. So please, David,

34
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,760
if at some point you want to jump in, please feel free to react like you would in a regular

35
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,840
living room kind of conversation. Charlie, what is the theory of computation all about?

36
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:52,200
Well, I think it's almost, you shouldn't ask about the computation particularly, but the deep

37
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:03,480
philosophical question is about the relation between mathematics and the physics, or the way

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:18,040
I pose the problem of cosmology is to find a mathematical home for our classical phenomenon.

39
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,720
So a phenomenon is like a genome. It's the set of phenomena that we are, the world that we inhabit.

40
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:35,960
So this is both a, it's a problem. Mathematics is a structure which we think is absolute and

41
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:42,760
independent of anything physical, and yet if we, the goal of cosmology, or of science in general,

42
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:55,480
is to find a mathematical explanation of the world. In other words, to find a part of this vast

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:06,760
structure that is mathematics within which what we see is, is typical instead of surprising and

44
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:13,960
puzzling. And I think that's why I've gotten interested in cosmology lately, because there are some

45
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:25,880
some things that seems to be, have been learned by modern cosmology that make, make it harder to,

46
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:34,440
to feel that we've solved this problem of finding a, a model of the universe within which, within

47
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:42,280
which what we see is, is, is, is typical. So this is, this touches on the, on the question of the

48
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:53,480
distinction between what, what is and what could be, and also on the anthropic principle and what,

49
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:02,840
what questions that some people have, have asked in terms of, of self-locating uncertainty.

50
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:11,000
And it's, it also gets into a question that's very ancient in mathematics, which is

51
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,800
in, in, in infinity, the nature of infinity. So the, the big, some big problems in cosmology,

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:26,520
I must say, I, I always go and ask Andres Albrecht, because he's been thinking about cosmology for,

53
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,760
for much longer time. And in, in one of the workshops we, we organized, he said, well,

54
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:43,560
maybe let's take an hour, an hour now and, and wallow in, in, in prior probabilities or prior,

55
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:58,280
prior, say this is a field where you never can solve anything. And I, I, one of the main things I,

56
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:09,160
I got from him was the, the, the attitude of beating as, as, as unsatisfied with your own

57
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:17,960
ideas as you are with everybody else's. So where was I going with this? But so the problem that,

58
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,200
that I said was, what I think we, one way of trying to approach this is just to, to,

59
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,360
to think of, oh, I was saying that infinity is very important. I think we can kind of prove that

60
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:43,080
if you have a finite world in thermal equilibrium, you get a very boring world with,

61
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,160
with essentially because of the, the Boltzmann brain problem. And so we can get interesting things

62
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,440
in an infinite system, which we can't get in the finite ones, qualitatively different. And

63
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,640
within that, I would say what I'm trying to find out is how,

64
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,760
how permanent disequilibrium can arise and how from disequilibrium,

65
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:23,640
complexity in the sense of logical depth can arise and how in that, in, in the system that is

66
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:34,520
doing that, a science can arise. And I don't ask about consciousness directly, because I think it

67
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:44,360
may be a, a sort of an illusion. So here we have a whole bunch of people who think they're talking

68
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:53,960
to each other on the screens or in the room, but, and the, the big philosophical, I guess they call

69
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,920
it the hard problem of consciousness of trying to decide what, what it means that we feel conscious.

70
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:11,240
Maybe is, is, is asking too much. And it would be easier to say, because our consciousnesses are

71
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:18,840
not independent of one another. We, we, if a person is raised without contact with other people,

72
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:25,400
they, they don't learn to think the way, the way we do. And Charlie, I know it's not my turn yet,

73
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:34,680
but can I just say it is infinity an illusion? Well, I think it's, it's, no, I think infinity is a

74
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,280
math, is a mathematical notion. So I, but I think that you need infinity to get the kind of permanent

75
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:47,160
disequilibrium that you need to, to, to escape the, the Boltzmann brain problem. You may need it,

76
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,920
but you may have another way of doing it. So, so, so in other words, I would say that instead of

77
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:01,720
saying, asking questions like, what, is it sort of the Copernican principle to it? Is it unusual

78
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:08,440
that I, that I'm alive at this moment, or that my observer moments are, are typical? I would just

79
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:18,280
say the, the entirety of, of terrestrial civilization, or the terrestrial,

80
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,800
even larger than human civilization, the terrestrial, the complexity of the terrestrial world

81
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,560
is something that we can look at a little bit more objectively than saying, speaking of consciousness.

82
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,840
And so we can say, well, maybe whales are conscious in a different way. And that's not

83
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:44,440
quite a scientific question. But, but I think we need to look for a mathematical model within

84
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:53,240
which, and I think it's has to be infinite, but maybe I'm wrong, within which what we see is,

85
00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:03,480
is, is typical under a kind of anthropic, as weak as, as weakly as possibly anthropic selection.

86
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Okay, and end of speech, at least, that's sort of the reason why you're invoking infinity,

87
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:18,040
because then you could have fluctuations. Well, if you have infinitely, yeah, I don't, if I just

88
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:26,440
have an infinity, let's say, like, like, Boltzmann's idea, which gave rise to the Boltzmann bring,

89
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:35,320
of just an infinite, almost, not, not even, this is before general relativity, an infinite

90
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,160
universe at equilibrium, then you, you get the Boltzmann brain problem, you get the fact that

91
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,320
you can't believe anything that you see. Because everything happens somewhere. And I think this

92
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:56,600
problem is, is somewhat better understood in the, in the more modern cosmologies.

93
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,960
But I was looking at very simple cellular automata models, in which by making the model in infinite,

94
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:12,600
and it's, it's dynamics is reversible, you get something that looks like unbounded complexity

95
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,600
that goes on forever, but it only goes on forever because the model is infinite. And it, therefore,

96
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,840
it can never, it can never equilibrate and get boring. I think I got a, I got a picture of it.

97
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:35,080
I'll see if I can find an example of the model like that. Here's. Okay, so this is a reversible

98
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:45,320
cellular automaton. And the time goes horizontally, like that. And there's, there's three,

99
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,360
there's three domains here. It's one dimensional automaton. So this is time history. And these,

100
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,800
these differ just by the reversal of black and white. So there's, there's domain, domain boundaries

101
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:07,160
that, that collide here, producing this, this complicated thing that just goes on forever,

102
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,920
getting more and more complicated. This, this business up here is an artifact because I was

103
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,240
doing it with periodic boundary conditions. And this was the wraparound. It was beginning to

104
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,680
affect it. But if you do it on an infinite model, at Lattice, it gets. So this is the sort of thing

105
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:28,120
where you can't get this in a finite model. If you do it in a, in a finite system with local

106
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:38,120
interactions, you get something that's, that looks more like, here, I'll just do it at the beginning.

107
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:43,880
Yeah. Same model. Yeah. So it gets, it gets interesting. And then if it, if you run long

108
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,760
enough, it just, it's boring. Okay. And I'll stop the screen share. So that's, that's,

109
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,200
that's why I think infinity is important. But that's just maybe I haven't been familiar enough

110
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:03,480
with cosmology, but I think the cosmologies, I think, let's see what see what Andy says, but

111
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:11,480
that I think that the, the, the cosmologies tend to be infinite now of also not have to stop sharing

112
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:20,360
my screen. Where is that? Yeah. Screen sharing stopped. There it is. Good. Okay. I was expecting

113
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,960
Charlie to throw us into cosmology, but to be honest, I didn't expect on question one, we would go

114
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:32,360
on to cosmology. Thank you, Charlie. I enjoyed it. David, would you like to react? Like, maybe,

115
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,680
maybe you can either react to Charlie's comments and, and how very as reaction. Yeah.

116
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,960
Perhaps you have a, you can backtrack the question and, and, and retake the theory of

117
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,640
computation. Well, I think that I can, I can react and respond to your question at the same time.

118
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:55,880
Because I think the, where I disagree with, with Charlie would be right at the beginning,

119
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:02,040
sort of foundation Lee. Oh, yeah. You remember, you should say the three Rs react, respond and refute.

120
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,760
Simultaneously to save time. Yes.

121
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:17,560
So I'm, if you ask, what is computation? What is computation in the universe? Well,

122
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,640
what are computers? Well, what is that all about? If I was answering that question,

123
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,920
I would have to have universal and universality right in the first sentence somewhere, because I

124
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,520
think that's what it's all about. Computation is physical. You know, I'm sure we can all agree on

125
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:45,480
that. But I think there is still a hint of the mathematician's misconception in Charlie's

126
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:55,800
conception of the computation, computers, physics. So I would say that the, the, the

127
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:08,120
computation exists, universality exists in, in a particular property of the physical universe.

128
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:18,920
Namely that the physical universe can accommodate machines, which are universal in the sense that

129
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:26,680
they can be programmed to mimic any other machine if they run long enough and have enough memory.

130
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,400
And for them to have, to run long enough and have enough memory, they have to be maintained,

131
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,920
they, they, they have to have additional memory added. And so there has to be implicitly,

132
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:46,200
there is a background of knowledge creation. If, if there is to be a sufficiently powerful

133
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:52,360
computer, like Turing machine or something, then in the background there has to be knowledge creation.

134
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:58,840
Just like, I think I first read this in Charlie's thing, like what would happen if you found a fountain

135
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:05,960
pen on the moon, then it would, it would tell you a massive amount. It would tell you that you,

136
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:15,080
it'd been settled by people from the 19th century. Yes. Yes. Most likely. And it's very, very unlikely

137
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:21,320
that it formed spontaneously. And so the most likely explanation for it would be that there

138
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,920
had been a civilization. You could, you could infer a lot about the civilization by, as you say,

139
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:35,160
it's a 19th century type civilization. And, and you can analyze the ink and therefore see what kind

140
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:43,320
of squids they had there. And, and so on. So this, another thing that this

141
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:51,720
illustrates, which you didn't mention, is that there's an intimate connection between emergent,

142
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:59,320
simple emergent properties and simple microscopic quantities. In fact, there are

143
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,680
laws about emergent properties. And the laws about evolution and knowledge and so on are among

144
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:16,040
the ones we would use to analyze the origin of this fountain pen. So the, we would, we would,

145
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,600
we would gain a lot of knowledge about microscopic information from some macroscopic

146
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:37,800
information and macroscopic laws. Now, so I haven't mentioned mathematics. No, no. And the

147
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,680
reason I haven't mentioned mathematics, even though I totally agree that there's a mathematical world

148
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:49,160
that's sort of super infinitely large and that world contains all possible functions and all

149
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:56,360
possible laws and all possible mathematical objects, the vast majority of which we cannot

150
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:03,800
even describe. The ones we can describe are basically the ones that are computable by these

151
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:14,200
machines, which are universal within our universe. So it's no good trying to explain that via

152
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:21,400
what is going to be likely, what you are going to be likely to see, because what is typical,

153
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,320
what is probable and so on, that those are all determined by the laws of physics. There is no

154
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:36,440
mathematical notion of probability that applies to physics, unless we have a law of physics saying

155
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:49,080
so. And in some cases we do and in some cases we don't. And even when we do so, and where we do

156
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:58,760
have a probabilistic theory of something, the anthropic principle alone doesn't contain any

157
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,120
information about what the laws of physics are. I, this is an argument that I got from Dennis

158
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:12,440
Sharma a long time ago with his reaction to Brandon Carter's famous paper about the anthropic

159
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:20,680
principle. The thing is, if you think of this as how do we fix what the dimensionless constants are,

160
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:28,840
or just the laws themselves, you could think of the laws themselves as being

161
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,040
enumerated, like in Solomonov induction, you know, so we have all possible laws and

162
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:42,680
so on. And you ask, given what we see, what is the most likely, that is all

163
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:50,520
inapplicable to fundamental physics, because at least not via the anthropic principle, because

164
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,240
if you think of the set of all the class or whatever it is, the set of all

165
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,720
universes consistent with something, like something consistent with the fountain pen on the moon,

166
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,400
or consistent with what we see, or whatever you want to say, consistent with the existence of

167
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:21,720
computers, almost all of them are on the very near the boundary of that set. They are almost

168
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:28,280
all of, because the larger the dimension of the set, the more of it is contained near its boundary.

169
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:35,720
So, if the only reason why we're here is that we're anthropically selected, then it's overwhelmingly

170
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,120
likely that we're going to die in the next nanosecond, or picosecond, I suppose. It depends

171
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:51,000
where the chaos, how fast the chaos is going to come in on us. And since we haven't that theory

172
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:59,880
hereby refuted. So, that's not the way to get the answer. I think the way to get an answer

173
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:07,960
is not to try to derive microscopic properties that will then give you the desired emergent

174
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,480
properties. It is to think of emergent laws, which, among other things, will give you microscopic

175
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:21,000
laws, as well as microscopic initial conditions like the ones that produced that fountain pen.

176
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:29,800
You see, Charlie, your example has lived with me for decades, and this has changed me deeply.

177
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:36,040
Well, I was thinking of an ordinary ballpoint pen set, but you put it back at sensory...

178
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:42,680
Oh, it's evolved into a fountain pen in my mind, because of its deep significance.

179
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:46,920
The ballpoint pen would just mean you have a hole in your pocket.

180
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,040
It fell out of an astronaut's pocket. It's a likely explanation.

181
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:01,400
For you, David, an example of an emergent law that constrains also the microscopic laws would be

182
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,720
there exist universal computers. Yes.

183
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:09,400
Okay. Would you like maybe to expand a bit more, because you've contributed quite significantly

184
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,440
to the church-turing thesis. I think there was quite a bit of ambiguity of how we should

185
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,400
understand the church-turing thesis, and now you name the physicality of the universal computer.

186
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,320
I right away see a link. Maybe it would be good to expand a little bit on that, especially for

187
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:31,960
the audience here. Okay. Well, this is controversial, and I don't think I did. I think it was Turing.

188
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:43,800
So the way the story is usually told is that Turing, Girdle, Church, and Post all came up

189
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,240
with the same idea at the same time, all proved the same theorems, basically, although they had

190
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:56,680
different points of view. None of them copied from each other. Although some of them knew about

191
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:05,000
each other, but they kind of converged on a conception. But I think Turing's conception was

192
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:16,120
different. The other three all had the mathematician's misconception. They all thought that they were

193
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:25,000
doing a piece of mathematics, or as Roger Penrose would say, meta-mathematics, theory of proofs.

194
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:36,840
But Turing, the way he solved the Hilbert's decision problem, was to think of a physical

195
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:45,640
model of proof, a physical model, and then argue implicitly, explicitly, that again,

196
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:59,240
is controversial, that that argument is decisive. That is, he thought he was proving,

197
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:15,560
and he almost did prove, that no physical object can escape being part of the Turing

198
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:22,360
universal Turing machine's repertoire. The universal Turing machine is an idealized

199
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:32,120
physical machine. It's really got nothing to do with mathematics. Its physical relationship

200
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,760
with the rest of the universe is what he elucidated. Then he said that that solves the

201
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,440
decision problem, because we must regard the decision problem itself as a question about

202
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:51,800
the physical world, including mathematicians and so on. That's why he used language like

203
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:59,560
functions that would naturally be regarded as computable. Naturally, I always took that to mean

204
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,280
straightforwardly, computable in nature. But when I said that to mathematicians,

205
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,560
they howled in rage and said that I'd misunderstood it. Well, if I'd been

206
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:18,040
misunderstood it, that misunderstanding turns out to be the truth, and Turing's writings look

207
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:26,920
exactly like that truth. I think he knew. He just wasn't used to talking about physics.

208
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:32,760
He was a mathematician, but I think he did not have the mathematician's misconception.

209
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,760
We're all brought up to have it. We have to free ourselves.

210
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,800
How would you say, what is the mathematician's misconception?

211
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:51,400
Well, it's the idea that, well, okay, for present company, I can put it like this.

212
00:26:54,040 --> 00:27:01,160
It's the idea that the integers and the logical operations like and or and not

213
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:10,120
are given to us by God. They are the natural things. If you can build some structure or

214
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:17,800
form some conclusion on top of those, then you have proved it. Whereas the real truth is that

215
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:26,520
the integers and the logical connectives and classical rules of inference and all that,

216
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:37,880
they are all given to us by physics alone. There is no underlying mathematical substrate

217
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,920
that we can appeal to. If the laws of physics were different, then we could have laws of physics

218
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:54,680
that didn't mention and or and not or integers or real numbers or they could use any mathematical

219
00:27:54,680 --> 00:28:00,920
objects anywhere in the mathematical world. But the fact that they don't is a feature of the laws

220
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:13,560
of physics. With this, with this misconception comes some other misconceptions such as, for example,

221
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:19,800
that simplicity is somehow defined independently of the laws of physics.

222
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:29,400
And infinity as well, as I have written, you know, Zeno was puzzled by the fact that there's

223
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,480
an infinite number of points between here and the other side of the room. And how come that he can

224
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,840
go from one point to another and how come he can do an infinite number of things in a finite time?

225
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:50,840
Well, the answer is that what is finite or infinite physically, its relationship to

226
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,440
mathematical finiteness or infinite is a matter for the laws of physics to determine. And they

227
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:03,800
happen to say that this particular infinite thing in classical physics, the continuum,

228
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:11,960
can be traversed, an infinite number of steps of traversing it can be finitely performed.

229
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:19,880
So what can be finitely performed or not or and what conversely what can only be infinitely

230
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:27,400
performed, i.e. can't be performed, is mandated by the laws of physics, not vice versa. So it's

231
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:34,120
physics that tells us the difference between find an infinite, complex and simple,

232
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:42,680
and also probability, which is a sort of scam lodged in the middle of all these misconceptions.

233
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:52,920
The idea that it's a meta misconception, a meta misconception, it's a what, sorry?

234
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,360
Meta misconception. Well, no, no, it's a good place to hide a scam.

235
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,320
Of the matter. There is simply a misconception that probability is another one of these concepts

236
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,600
that we can help ourselves to and we haven't yet invoked any physics. We would like what we see

237
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:24,520
to have at least 0.83 probability, then we won't worry that it's strange. And that invocation

238
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:32,840
of probability we take to be sort of harmless. We don't see that there's a rich world of physics

239
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,520
defining what we mean by that. And in the case of probability, unlike the other things,

240
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:46,600
it doesn't even apply to most of the universe or the multiverse. It just applies to very

241
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:56,280
special situations. So there's no excuse for it. Let me just ask a little bit, a clarification,

242
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,840
David. If I would have been asked what's the mathematician misconception, in a nutshell,

243
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:07,640
I would have said it's the idea that proof theory is a branch of mathematics. But proof theory is

244
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,440
a branch of physics, ultimately. It's given rise to computer science. Computer science has its

245
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:20,680
roots into what our computers are physical objects. Now, the story you just gave us,

246
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,520
you started speaking of natural numbers and logical connectors. How can I bridge those two

247
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:34,760
pictures of the mathematician misconception? Well, they are the same, I think.

248
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:43,720
Maybe I'm giving a try and then tell me. Because we typically do proofs with

249
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:49,240
typical logical connectors and that will give rise to somehow our computers so that we end up

250
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:54,200
abstracting our computers with those logical connectors and those integers. And that's where

251
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,960
you say that taking this as a way to formalize proof is basically physical because I'm already

252
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:11,240
abstracting my physics of the computation. Yes. I think that's basically what I said.

253
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,480
I'm not really used to speaking in mathematical language. So I speak of it in terms of laws of

254
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:26,360
physics. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Now, I was trying to map this, the statement proof theory is a

255
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:33,000
branch of physics. Yeah. So I think probably Turing never said this, but I'm sure if he was here

256
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:43,320
now, he would agree that proof theory is a branch of physics. Yeah. Okay. I have,

257
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,160
I found myself agreeing with almost everything you said until you started talking about the

258
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:54,760
mathematical mathematician's misconception, which I don't think Turing would have agreed with you

259
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:10,280
about, and which I think is actually a piece of professionalism. It's an idea that you don't like,

260
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,800
but you haven't shown that there's anything false about it. In fact, I think Turing

261
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:27,240
thought more about physics than his contemporaries. But I think he felt that this, the discovery of

262
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:38,680
universality meant that the physics of that we have here could be simulated by a computer.

263
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,120
And the physics that might exist in a very different world, perhaps one with a different

264
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:53,400
number of dimensions or one that's not even has a notion of locality, could also be simulated

265
00:33:53,400 --> 00:34:01,160
by a Turing machine. In other words, I believe he felt the, he was very aware of physics and he,

266
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:09,240
but he didn't think that different, different parts of the multiverse with, think of the string

267
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,320
theory, the vast number of different supposed things that can come out of string theory,

268
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,400
of which we might be one, that they would have a different mathematics. He think he would,

269
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:27,240
I think he believed in the universality of mathematics and its ability to simulate physics.

270
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,560
So that's where I think that you're even calling it a misconception, is a misconception of what

271
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,520
Turing thought and also a, a, a disphemism rather than any kind of refutation. However,

272
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,400
almost everything you said at the beginning, I agreed with, I said, I take for granted that,

273
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,640
that, that universality of computation, the unsolvability of the problem, which is the same

274
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:59,560
thing, is the, the, the heart of, of what, what the notion of computation is. And that the,

275
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:05,960
the other thing is that, that I also didn't even say because I, I believe it so strongly,

276
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:12,760
is that this, this mathematics, this universal mathematics of, of computation is,

277
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:21,000
is capable of, of simulating physics, not only the physics that we have here,

278
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,440
but if you talk to Andreas, if he's still around here, there he is. Yes. In, in many models of

279
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,560
cosmology, now imagine that there are, that there are inaccessible parts of the universe,

280
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,120
which are no, no less real than ours, except that we'll never hear about them,

281
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,840
in which the laws of physics, such as the number of spatial dimensions and the number of temporal

282
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:53,560
dimensions, if you want, and, and, and are extremely different. And in, in almost all of them,

283
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:58,680
universal computers don't exist. They exist physically, but they don't exist. There's nobody

284
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,680
there to complain about it or to celebrate it. But they're there. They're like the, the desert

285
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:11,160
areas of, of, of, of the universe. But all of that could be simulated by mathematics. So I don't

286
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:15,240
think there's a, I don't think there's, I don't think there is a mathematician's misconception.

287
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:23,400
There's just the, the idea, which has been around since, since, since Galileo, that, that

288
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:32,040
whatever physics is, is discoverable by experiment and in a model level by, by mathematics.

289
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:40,280
I think that's clearly untrue. If by universe you mean

290
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:48,760
the set of all, or potentially the set of all possible mathematical entities

291
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,400
instantiated as physical objects, as you say, most of those would not be

292
00:36:54,520 --> 00:37:00,680
simulatable by a Turing machine. No, no, I, no, they all would be simulatable by a Turing machine.

293
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,520
Most of them wouldn't give rise to the physical possibility of Turing machine in that part of

294
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,680
the universe. For example, I don't think there are a lot of Turing machines in the middle of the sun.

295
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:20,200
But in the space of all mathematical objects, there are objects which solve the halting problem.

296
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:27,480
And that such an object cannot be simulated by a Turing machine. It can, it might, there are,

297
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,720
there are also kind of universes where. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I have, yeah. This is in other words,

298
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:42,600
these, these, like the, the, clean the hierarchy of all of these higher level of unsolvable problems,

299
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:46,920
what, what you, the problems that you can solve if you had an oracle for the holding problem.

300
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,800
Now, I have an idea that I'd like to run by

301
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:59,720
mathematicians, such as yourself, even these mathematicians, which just as I have been lately,

302
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,480
over the last five years, seduced by cosmology. And so think, oh, it must have the answers to all

303
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,080
the things I worried about since I was five. Let me try to understand it better. So, you know,

304
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:17,160
you're a mathematician and you said, you've gotten to be so fascinated with physics. All the answers

305
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,920
to all the things I'm wondering about in mathematics must be in physics somewhere. Let me learn some

306
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,880
physics. Well, anyway, this is an idea that you probably know more about as a mathematician.

307
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:38,280
But when I was writing about the, the, the, the, Chaton's omega number, the holding probability

308
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,080
of a universal computer with self-delimiting programs, where if you had this number, you would,

309
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:50,520
you would have an oracle for the holding problem, but it would be at a painfully slow oracle that

310
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,440
In other words, in order to answer any question,

311
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,840
you would have to run for a busy beaver amount of time.

312
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,400
And I said, well, this Oracle would

313
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:03,720
be universal in the sense that it would

314
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:08,240
decide all finitely refutable propositions.

315
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,840
In other words, problems such that you

316
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,280
can express them with one quantifier

317
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,000
over the natural numbers.

318
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
In other words, there exists a time

319
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,000
such that if you run this Turing machine for this amount

320
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,840
of time, it halts.

321
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:34,640
And then I speculated that the harder problems,

322
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,680
which would involve two quantifiers or more

323
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:42,720
like the twin prime conjecture, might be, by and large,

324
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,400
not interesting because not mathematically interesting

325
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:58,760
because they could be decided by a stronger but finitely

326
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,560
refutable proposition.

327
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,400
In other words, instead of saying there are infinitely

328
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:11,560
many twin primes, you could say that the spacing between twin

329
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:19,400
primes grows more rapidly or more slowly

330
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,440
than a certain function.

331
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,880
So in other words, one of the quantifiers,

332
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,800
something that has more than one quantifier,

333
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,520
might turn out to be a consequence of something

334
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,080
that has only one quantifier.

335
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,840
So what you're feeling about when you say natural

336
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,920
in mathematics, maybe these things that

337
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:44,840
are harder than the halting problem are just kind of boring

338
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,440
because probably most of them would be, what do I mean?

339
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,920
By probably, I'm invoking your scam of probability.

340
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,360
Probably most of them would be decided

341
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,040
as cases of the halting problem.

342
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,800
I was sure for most of what you've just said

343
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,000
that you were addressing, Charles,

344
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,600
because I'm certainly not a mathematician.

345
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,040
Them's fighting words, you know.

346
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,560
Oh, OK, OK.

347
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:13,040
If you have an idea, if you have a tentative answer,

348
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,840
David, go for it.

349
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,680
But I also thought about it.

350
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,280
I know exactly.

351
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:16,800
Go ahead.

352
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,280
No, no.

353
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,000
Yeah, OK.

354
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,840
I'm sorry, I almost said that at the point.

355
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,960
I think that your case, I remember that piece, Charlie,

356
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,080
you wrote, in which you say that you specifically

357
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,520
spoke about the twin prime conjecture.

358
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,280
But was that naturally carried over

359
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,000
to higher elements of the arithmetic hierarchy?

360
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,280
I think so, because if you're saying,

361
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,520
if you bound these quantifiers, you can make them go away.

362
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,720
And if a bound exists, it could be

363
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:50,480
that there's a proposition that decides the twin prime conjecture

364
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,800
by proving a stronger conjecture that is just

365
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,760
of the same form as a halting problem.

366
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,560
Yeah.

367
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,840
And if you had three or four quantifiers,

368
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,880
it could same thing, I believe the same thing could happen.

369
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,080
I didn't think anything.

370
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:08,800
And what if the, OK, so another sort of possible glitch

371
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,160
that I see is, if the spacing in the twin prime conjecture

372
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,760
scales, suppose, larger than busy beaver,

373
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,960
then no algorithm can base it.

374
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, it could.

375
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,760
Yeah, so that's exactly it.

376
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,120
In other words, if you say, irrefutable.

377
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,920
Yeah, certain things of that sort could exist.

378
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,120
So I guess this is like experimental mathematics,

379
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,200
except you can't do the experiments.

380
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,160
But it just occurred to me.

381
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,960
I don't know, has anybody thought about that?

382
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,000
How do you decide how plausible it

383
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:52,080
is that one of these higher level conjectures

384
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:55,760
could be decided by a provable.

385
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,040
Oh, yes, it's really a futile gesture,

386
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,920
because it's like, if I had a solution to the halting problem,

387
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,480
then maybe I could solve the twin prime conjecture

388
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
without doing any extra work.

389
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,720
But that's like, if my aunt had wheels,

390
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,520
she'd be a trolley car, because I don't

391
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,240
have a solution to the halting problem.

392
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,840
Yeah, but it might also be that you

393
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,560
have a solution to the halting problem, and you still can.

394
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,000
And you still couldn't, yes.

395
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,360
So how do you compare the likelihood of those two things?

396
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,920
And I'm sure something's thought about.

397
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:23,120
And what we mean by likelihood, but yeah.

398
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:25,040
Yeah, shut up.

399
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,760
But actually, basically, perhaps we

400
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,480
could move on on the topic of incompleteness.

401
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,760
And I think you bring it on.

402
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,000
I had a bit of a context, maybe, to get people into it.

403
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,720
But the incompleteness of mathematics

404
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,440
was perhaps we have to start it back to Hilbert, where

405
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,880
he was hoping to put into a single formal leximistic

406
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,600
theory all of mathematical truths.

407
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:56,000
And Girdel in 1931 basically put an end to this hope

408
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,720
by finding a statement that is true and has no proof.

409
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,360
But Girdel's statement is self-referential,

410
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,960
and it might look like an exotic kind of statements.

411
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,160
So it's tempting to think that these kind of statements

412
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,480
are an anomaly, and that we can safely ignore them

413
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,160
and keep doing proofs and mathematics

414
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,680
like we usually would have before Girdel's result.

415
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,400
And I assume most mathematicians live their life this way,

416
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,000
and I don't blame them.

417
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,880
But seen from an algorithmic information theory perspective,

418
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,880
notably due to the work of Gregory Chaitan,

419
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,720
one of your former colleagues, I believe, Charlie,

420
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,040
incompleteness is a much more widespread and inevitable

421
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,560
phenomenon.

422
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,960
So for one thing, Chaitan's result of incompleteness

423
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,920
does not involve self-referential statements.

424
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,200
And also, they're usually cast in a way

425
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,720
that he comes up with an infinite family of true

426
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,200
but unprovable statements.

427
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,480
And then he say, oh, I will enlarge my formal leximistic

428
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,360
theory to be able to prove more of those statements.

429
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,800
But by doing so, you only manage to prove finitely more.

430
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,560
But you're still in front, regardless

431
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,880
how big your formal leximistic theory grows,

432
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,400
you're always in front of an infinity of true yet

433
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,280
unprovable statements.

434
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,480
These are generally the ideas from the algorithmic information

435
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,560
theoretic proofs of incompleteness.

436
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,080
So yeah, I think algorithmic information theory

437
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,360
makes the case for somewhat natural.

438
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,560
Incompleteness becomes somewhat natural and actually

439
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,080
inevitable.

440
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,360
Charlie, would you like to react or comment or expand

441
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:33,360
on the limits of our formal leximistic theories?

442
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:37,680
Notably, I have in mind maybe some

443
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,880
of how we should behave with respect

444
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,360
to formal leximistic theories in the light

445
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,840
of these incompleteness theorems.

446
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:48,400
Chaitan has suggested maybe we should acquire new axioms based

447
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,240
on their fertility of the consequences,

448
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,040
the problems that they help us solving.

449
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,080
To me, there's a striking similarity now

450
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:58,440
between what theoretical physicists do,

451
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:02,280
where they change or update their principles

452
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,640
based on the problems that we're care to solve.

453
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,760
So do you have any remarks to make on that line

454
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,520
of philosophy of incompleteness?

455
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,560
Well, I'm more of a physicist.

456
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:23,720
So those are the things that I suggested,

457
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:28,040
which is maybe, I really love computational universality.

458
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,800
And the, I couldn't live, this reminds me

459
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:45,200
of what Danny Greenberger said about quantum mechanics.

460
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:50,200
He said, in any god that would know

461
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,480
which slit the particle went through,

462
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:58,080
I wouldn't believe in that god of the two slit experiments.

463
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:05,280
So I would say anyone who would like to live in a world

464
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,200
that Hilbert wanted to find, I wouldn't want to be friends

465
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,280
with that person.

466
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:19,000
In other words, I think that the universality and the dual

467
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,840
side to it is the incompleteness is just the way,

468
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,040
a beautiful feature of the way world is.

469
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,120
It's beautiful in mathematics in the same way

470
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:34,320
that quantum mechanics is beautiful in physics

471
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:36,680
or general relativity.

472
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:37,120
Nice.

473
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:37,480
Thanks.

474
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,840
David, what is your take on incompleteness?

475
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,080
And it doesn't have to be from the algorithmic information

476
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:42,960
theoretic perspective.

477
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,840
Just what are your thoughts?

478
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,880
I would agree with what Charlie just said.

479
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,320
It's the world that Hilbert envisaged

480
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:55,800
is a world without creativity.

481
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,720
And probably ultimately, if you take our world

482
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,440
and hobble it down to that level,

483
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,560
life could never have evolved.

484
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:11,400
So ours is a world in which life can evolve

485
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:16,960
because there's incompleteness in the mathematics

486
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,400
that describe our world.

487
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,040
I said mathematics just now as a concession to you all.

488
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,000
But what I meant is entirely a physical thing.

489
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,280
It's a physical property of the world,

490
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:39,320
which is responsible for the possibility of life

491
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:45,120
and then later, presumably, of intelligence and creativity.

492
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:56,760
And science and of the limitlessness of science.

493
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,520
So the illimitability of science is itself,

494
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,560
let's put it the other way around.

495
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,080
If science was limited, if there was a feature of the universe

496
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,960
that limits science in the way that Hilbert wanted

497
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,520
to limit mathematics, then there couldn't

498
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,120
have been any science in the first place.

499
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:22,720
And this is another one of those connections

500
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,000
between what we call emergent properties

501
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,200
and what we call microscopic properties.

502
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:36,240
I would like to see a way of formulating the laws of physics

503
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:40,880
that doesn't discriminate between microscopic and emergent

504
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,200
laws of physics.

505
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,120
A lot of the notorious problems we have,

506
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:52,320
like how to define entropy and the arrow of time and so on,

507
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:58,640
I think are just because we insist that the world must

508
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,040
be fundamentally made of microscopic laws.

509
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:08,840
So just to let you all know, constructor theory

510
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:15,720
is an attempt to have a scale independent way

511
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,120
of describing laws.

512
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,920
I think someone's raised a hand, is that?

513
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,920
OK.

514
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,400
So you said that if there was anything

515
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,880
that limited science in the universe, if science was somehow,

516
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,920
if the universe somehow limited the scope of science,

517
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,320
then science couldn't have gone the start in the first place.

518
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:43,920
But I can imagine that the observable universe is actually

519
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,600
all there is.

520
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,800
Beyond the observable universe, there's no matter.

521
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,840
There's only space.

522
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,600
So there's nothing to help us, I know,

523
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,800
form larger and larger computations.

524
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,160
So at some point, we reach the limit

525
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,760
of what we can do with computers or something like that.

526
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:02,760
And that would still be consistent with us having

527
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,440
to do science right now.

528
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:09,840
And I was wondering if you think it's wrong that maybe,

529
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,200
even if there's a world without, even beyond the observable

530
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,680
universe, there's no matter, that you can somehow still

531
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,800
have science that progresses infinitely,

532
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,480
or if there's another mistake, or I'm

533
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,000
curious about the response to that.

534
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:24,800
Yeah.

535
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,280
So I think that is wrong.

536
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,400
And it's for exactly the same reason that I was just saying.

537
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:37,160
If we characterize all possible laws

538
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:43,120
as being like our world, but it only lasts a million years,

539
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,320
or like our world, but it only lasts a billion years,

540
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,360
or then there are lots of possibilities

541
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:57,360
where it would look like our world was the actual one.

542
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:59,720
And similarly for mathematics, you

543
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:04,040
could have, it might be possible for proofs

544
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:08,600
to reach up to a million steps, but no more,

545
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,000
because it's so happened that the laws of physics

546
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,320
make all computers decay after they have performed

547
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:15,640
a million steps.

548
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:22,160
And there are many more of those worlds

549
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,560
than there are what we think the actual world is,

550
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,360
with no limits.

551
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:33,440
And that is because that's an illustration of the fact

552
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:38,440
that it's OK.

553
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:44,000
I won't say it's because the limitless one is simpler,

554
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,600
because that would be falling into the mathematician's

555
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,280
misconception.

556
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,760
But I want to say something like that.

557
00:52:50,800 --> 00:53:01,200
I want to say that the limitless one is a good explanation

558
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,920
in high-level terms.

559
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,360
If you try to translate that into low-level terms,

560
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,520
you'll get to variations of it, which look like, well,

561
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,800
it only lasts a million years.

562
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,160
It only lasts two million years, and so on.

563
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:19,960
But at the high level, variations of it

564
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,440
are very difficult to find, because you would have to say,

565
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,400
OK, proof is limited by what?

566
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,920
You would have to have some high-level thing that

567
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,120
can fit into the language of talking about proofs

568
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:45,720
and limits and completeness, and so on.

569
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,400
So from the point of view of physics,

570
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:52,240
these are all high-level macroscopic constructs.

571
00:53:55,080 --> 00:54:00,600
But I think those are the fundamental concepts in which

572
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,600
the laws of physics actually are expressed.

573
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:10,200
And because of that, we can say that insisting

574
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:16,040
on describing it all microscopically is perverse,

575
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,600
because it's much less simple.

576
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,000
But what we really mean is that there

577
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,880
are no good explanations along that route.

578
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,280
Very good words.

579
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:29,400
Can I summarize?

580
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,000
How are we going to speak?

581
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,520
The way I understand what you just said

582
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,680
is that there's other explanation of,

583
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,080
might well be that in some sense, it

584
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,280
could be that the universe ends above the observable,

585
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,840
that the observable universe is all there is,

586
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,480
but that would ruin other explanations

587
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,120
that can have, like, face dimensions of how science works.

588
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:48,600
Yes.

589
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,100
Yeah.

590
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,480
And if you're going to settle for that,

591
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,240
you might as well settle for the fairies

592
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,680
at the bottom of the garden.

593
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,200
We needn't have embarked on this great project

594
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,040
of mathematics and physics.

595
00:54:59,040 --> 00:54:59,540
Yes.

596
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,200
Thanks.

597
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,560
David, would you relate the incompleteness phenomenon

598
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,440
in mathematics with fallibilism in knowledge creation

599
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,200
in general?

600
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,120
It seems like you sort of invoked it

601
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:16,560
when you invoked life.

602
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,400
Is that the similar idea?

603
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:22,320
Yes, it's, again, a similar idea and for the same reason,

604
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:30,880
that if fallibilism were not true

605
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,120
and there were infallible ways of deriving knowledge,

606
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,600
then when we have derived some knowledge,

607
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,680
it would never change.

608
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,400
And it would be true.

609
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,760
And the world would be finite, the world

610
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,000
would be a representation of that finite piece of knowledge.

611
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,760
And conversely, the real situation

612
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,280
is that the world is infinitely amenable to knowledge

613
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:06,080
creation, and therefore, it must be infinitely

614
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:09,960
susceptible to errors, which, however, can be corrected.

615
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:16,720
But nothing provides a firm foundation.

616
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,760
Not even, and I repeat what I said earlier,

617
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,120
not even logic, not even the logical rules of inference,

618
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,160
those are all conjectures.

619
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,440
We pick them because they seem right,

620
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,320
because they seem useful, they seem fruitful.

621
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,560
But who knows?

622
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,880
We may find new ones.

623
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:47,160
Are you saying that there could be a world in which pi was rational,

624
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:48,960
or a square root of 2, say?

625
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,000
Well, of course, that's a fairly simple case.

626
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,720
All it would have to do is have a different geometry from ours,

627
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,240
not Euclidean geometry.

628
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,080
I mean, pi isn't instantiated in the universe anyway.

629
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,040
It's an idealization.

630
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,120
So if you actually measure a circle,

631
00:57:11,120 --> 00:57:15,560
you'll never get pi as the ratio between the radius

632
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:21,040
and the diameter and the circumference.

633
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:24,560
I was thinking of the mathematical pi.

634
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:27,880
Well, there are two different things

635
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,160
one might mean by the mathematical pi.

636
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,760
Physics allows us a certain window

637
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,000
onto the class of abstractions, a tiny window.

638
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,280
We can see some of them, we can form theories about some of them,

639
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,400
we can learn about some of them,

640
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:46,120
and they include Euclidean geometry with its pi.

641
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,720
That pi cannot be changed by anyone, not even God,

642
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,480
not even if we look out of a different window.

643
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,680
But if we did look out of a different window,

644
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,760
thanks to having different laws of physics,

645
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,520
or if the laws of physics were not what we think they are,

646
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,120
but are a bit different from what we think they are,

647
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,960
as happened with Euclidean geometry and general relativity,

648
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:14,160
then we won't find pi out there in the stuff we can look at.

649
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,480
We can still describe it, we can describe pi,

650
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,880
and we can describe the universe as it actually is,

651
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,320
which doesn't have pi.

652
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:28,960
And there will be other ones which we can't describe.

653
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:31,320
We can't describe, but they may have people

654
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,720
in them which can describe them.

655
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,320
And then there'll be infinitely more,

656
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,960
where there aren't people who can describe anything.

657
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,480
And be careful to conclude that therefore we don't exist,

658
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,480
because that is like the anthropic principle misconception.

659
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:55,280
Just because of misconceptions.

660
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:00,440
I would say the misapplication of the anthropic principle.

661
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,680
These places exist,

662
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,240
but there's nobody there to complain about it.

663
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,080
No, but you want to use it to deduce something

664
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,640
about the world we do see.

665
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,080
And I don't think the anthropic principle

666
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:17,320
is powerful enough to do that,

667
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,320
because it will only, the most it can do is put it on the edge.

668
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,320
Yeah, I agree, I want to say something about on the edge,

669
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,680
because you reminded me of that.

670
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,120
And I don't want to show you a picture,

671
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,120
is that okay now?

672
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,600
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

673
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,200
Okay, so I started worrying about this

674
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:40,200
in terms of the Boltzmann brain problem,

675
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,160
which most of you are familiar with,

676
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,480
but here's a sort of a summary of it.

677
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,720
The New York Times version, from Sean Carroll.

678
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:53,680
This was Boltzmann's idea that the-

679
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,280
We don't see it Charlie.

680
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:56,720
Oh, I'll have to stay here.

681
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,080
I see it, I don't see why, okay.

682
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,120
The reason the universe is out of equilibrium is anthropic.

683
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,240
That is that if the universe is infinite and at equilibrium,

684
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:11,280
but we couldn't exist in one of these typical parts.

685
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,320
So we're in an atypical part, anthropically selected.

686
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,560
But then somebody else, I think it was Edicton said,

687
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:22,160
wait a minute, if that's true, then we probably,

688
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,000
most probably are in the smallest fluctuation

689
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,040
consistent with our brain existing.

690
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:34,000
And so the idea was that you would get something like this.

691
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,400
Where do I go to the next screen here?

692
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,400
Yeah, let's see if we go down here, yes.

693
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,280
Yes.

694
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,520
Okay, so people worried about equilibration

695
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,000
and were in the 19th century,

696
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,760
they called it the heat death of the universe,

697
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,880
but they thought it was a different problem

698
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,240
for the distant future.

699
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,800
But Boltzmann or Eddington showed it's a problem in the present,

700
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,120
undermining our ability to make inferences

701
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,880
about conditions in the past or elsewhere,

702
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,080
because the inhabitants of any universe

703
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,880
that will eventually equilibrate

704
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,400
would have to make the additional postulate

705
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,080
that they're situated atypically early in its history.

706
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,080
Now that gets into David's very nice pointing out that

707
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,280
from a Occam's razor point of view,

708
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,200
a world that is just like our world,

709
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,120
but ends in a second from now

710
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,400
or a million years from now

711
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,800
has almost as simple a description.

712
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:40,040
So anyway, the Boltzmann brain problem says

713
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,240
that if world equilibrates,

714
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,360
then almost all places that experience

715
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:48,280
the same phenomena that we have,

716
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,000
these are illusory phenomena

717
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:54,240
that don't give grounds for scientific inference.

718
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:58,400
So now there's, this is a little bit like the doomsday problem,

719
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,400
which you can argue that the world that has civilization in it

720
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:10,800
is, has only existed for a very short time

721
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,080
compared to the time available to it.

722
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,800
And why is we so atypically early?

723
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,400
Maybe it's because tech civilization

724
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:24,640
is intrinsically unstable, it'll destroy itself.

725
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,880
Or maybe there's something that I think David would like

726
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,400
is perpetual noonless.

727
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,880
That is maybe a billion years from now,

728
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,520
there will still be people,

729
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:35,680
but they will be preoccupied

730
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:39,040
that some qualitatively new feature of their existence,

731
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,200
which they consider very important, is so new.

732
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:46,560
And they wonder why they are so near the beginning

733
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:50,200
of infinity, as David would put it.

734
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,760
So I would like to credit the anthropic principle

735
01:02:55,760 --> 01:03:00,200
to Schopenhauer, who really expressed it in the 19th century, 1844,

736
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,360
before Darwin.

737
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:08,160
And here he says that the world is on the brink of self-destruction.

738
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:15,160
And we should expect to find it that way

739
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:19,680
because of this surface to volume argument

740
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,600
in high-dimensional space that David made.

741
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:25,680
That is that if there are many variables

742
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,400
and all of them have to be within a certain range

743
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,920
for the world to be habitable or for it to support life

744
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,720
or for it to support universal computation,

745
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,920
then with the highest probability,

746
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:38,080
we're right near the edge

747
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:43,080
and only a little, very close to self-destruction.

748
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:48,080
And this is Schopenhauer's,

749
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,440
he didn't put it in a mathematical terms, but if you did,

750
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:56,520
if he says, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds.

751
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,640
In fact, we live in very nearly the worst

752
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,480
of all possible worlds,

753
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,520
because if we imagine goodness of a world

754
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,840
depending on many parameters here too,

755
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:12,040
and we just take everything to lowest order,

756
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,240
and the goodness is a quadratic function

757
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:17,880
in the best of all possible worlds is the maximum.

758
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,520
And then we find that we're very close to the edge,

759
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:26,120
so we're probably right around the edge here,

760
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,040
and therefore we should expect the world

761
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:30,360
to be in the brink of self-destruction

762
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:32,800
as it apparently is politically right now.

763
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,040
And so we just have to hope that it survives.

764
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:41,280
Well, that's my comment that I thought

765
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,640
had to do with what we were talking about.

766
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,440
Yeah, again, I advocate thinking

767
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:53,440
in terms of high-level fundamental laws rather than insisting.

768
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,880
How do you discover what these high-level fundamental laws

769
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,560
because how do you...

770
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:01,040
Same, well, we already have...

771
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,280
Discover them or refute them, yeah.

772
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,800
Yeah, the same way that we discovered low-level ones,

773
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:09,480
conjecture, we have a problem

774
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,760
that we think might be soluble

775
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,800
by postulating a law of nature.

776
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:18,360
And the law of nature seems to answer that problem

777
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:19,720
and many other problems.

778
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,000
And so if it doesn't,

779
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,080
then we haven't solved the problem yet.

780
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:30,080
And the more it does, the more problems it exposes,

781
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,720
which we then solve and so on.

782
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,360
Now, we're doing this at many levels already.

783
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:39,600
I mean, there are people who have deep theories

784
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:42,920
about what it takes to win a war

785
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,400
and what it takes to make a stable society

786
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,940
and what it takes to cure depression and so on.

787
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:54,480
It's just that we have a culture that stigmatizes those

788
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:58,160
from the point of view of being fundamental.

789
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,240
So we only expect such knowledge

790
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:05,560
to extend to our own planet, our own time,

791
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,480
our own species, if that.

792
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:14,320
You know, we don't think of them as being fundamental,

793
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:18,040
but some of them, like the law of the existence

794
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:23,440
of universal computation is,

795
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:26,400
and the law of increase of entropy for that matter,

796
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:33,480
they are, from a practical point of view,

797
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,320
we do regard them as fundamental,

798
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,680
like as Eddington or someone said,

799
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,320
you know, if somebody tells you that the first law

800
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:45,720
of thermodynamics is wrong,

801
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:49,040
then so much the worst for the theory,

802
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:52,680
but if they say the second law is wrong,

803
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:55,880
then they must retire in deep humiliation and so on.

804
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,880
So we do actually have confidence in high level laws.

805
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:04,280
It's just that we have a culture

806
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,760
that tells us that those can't be fundamental.

807
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:10,920
We can't kind of infer things about the universe

808
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:15,320
and the big bang and the long-term survival of the universe

809
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:21,320
and bits of the universe that we can't see.

810
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:25,960
This sort of consideration is, you know,

811
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:30,280
it's considered ludicrous to try to talk about that

812
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:35,000
from using concepts like knowledge

813
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,080
and even computation and information and so on.

814
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,880
Information actually is a bit of an exception

815
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,440
because thanks to the mathematician's misconception,

816
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,640
people are inclined to think that information is fundamental

817
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:52,040
and everything might be made of bits.

818
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:56,080
But, yes, so, but-

819
01:07:56,080 --> 01:08:00,240
So you like bit from it rather than it from bit.

820
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:02,080
Sorry?

821
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,760
You like bit from it rather than-

822
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,080
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

823
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,960
So that's very much Landauer's,

824
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,920
you probably sympathize with what he said.

825
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,560
About this.

826
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,480
Information is physical.

827
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,880
Oh, yeah, well, of course, I thought we all did.

828
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,280
I thought that's his great contribution to the world.

829
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:26,600
Wheeler put it the other way.

830
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,680
He says physics is informational.

831
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:31,360
Yeah, well, that's a misconception.

832
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:33,720
That obviously can't be right.

833
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:41,800
It's the same thing as expecting us to be in a simulation

834
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:46,200
and the aliens simulating us on a giant computer.

835
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:47,600
And for some reason,

836
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,760
people think that that computer has got to be a Turing machine.

837
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:53,520
That's simply a non sequitur.

838
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,520
It's just a parochial forcing of a human concept

839
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,960
onto imaginary superhuman aliens.

840
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:10,120
You mean you think it might be a machine

841
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:12,120
at the higher level of the hierarchy,

842
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,640
which could solve the holding problem

843
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,080
and then was worrying about harder things?

844
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,080
Yes, although calling it higher level, that's from our-

845
01:09:21,080 --> 01:09:23,360
I mean, in the cleaning hierarchy.

846
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,080
Which is, again, expressed from our point of view.

847
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:32,080
It could just have different fundamental states

848
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,440
and different fundamental operations.

849
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,400
So one of its fundamental operations might be

850
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,160
to solve the holding problem.

851
01:09:41,160 --> 01:09:46,160
Not very slowly, like you're envisaging, but instantly.

852
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:50,240
So you could ask it questions about Turing machines

853
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:53,080
and it could answer all such questions instantly.

854
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:56,440
On the other hand, adding two and two

855
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,840
would have it scratching its head for a million years.

856
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,400
Probably like Warcase, right?

857
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,960
I haven't read it actually.

858
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:09,440
Oh, it's full of things like that,

859
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,000
about a guy who remembers everything

860
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
and is paralyzed by that and about-

861
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,880
Oh, right.

862
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:27,800
Well, you can't deny that in the set

863
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,160
of all mathematical objects, such things exist.

864
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,720
And therefore it is logically possible

865
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:38,320
that physics conforms to that object

866
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:40,720
rather than the objects we think it conforms to.

867
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,720
Okay, I admit that.

868
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,600
I think I'm going to just disagree with you

869
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,840
in a way that we can't prove very easily

870
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:52,600
because Turing is dead,

871
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:57,600
that he would have sympathized more with my view

872
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,280
that all the different parts of physics,

873
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,480
including the parts of the universe we can't get to

874
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,920
because they're beyond the Hubble distance,

875
01:11:07,160 --> 01:11:09,360
would be simulable by a Turing machine

876
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,680
and wouldn't involve these higher-level things.

877
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:17,120
But seriously, physicists like, remember Hartle,

878
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,680
Garrach and Hartle wrote a paper

879
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,920
about what would an uncomputable number look like

880
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,080
if it was a physical constant?

881
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,120
And I think that's certainly a legitimate question.

882
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,880
And you're saying that those things,

883
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:36,400
that one aspect of the mathematician's disphemism

884
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:41,400
is that they assume that such things don't exist.

885
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:46,840
Yes, yes, when applied to physics, yes.

886
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:50,880
And I think David was also invoking

887
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,440
not just beyond the Hubble distance,

888
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,120
but also in a completely different universe.

889
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,520
Yeah, well, that's what string theory gives us

890
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,160
as far as I understand, Andreas,

891
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,480
that there are things where,

892
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,480
I guess it's consistent with quantum field theory

893
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:08,760
and general relativity,

894
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,880
but things that are just extremely different

895
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,280
from anything that we easily imagine.

896
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:17,800
Yeah, you don't even need string theory.

897
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,800
I would say the development of theoretical physics

898
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,760
keeps pulling us in that direction.

899
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,400
And it's hard to truncate.

900
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:31,160
I don't know if it's, you know, right,

901
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:34,720
but the flavor of theoretical physics,

902
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:37,800
yeah, even uncomputable things could be there.

903
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:40,240
I don't think that way.

904
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,760
So I don't know how to answer that,

905
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:47,760
but I think one of the fascinating things

906
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,440
about cosmology is that

907
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,880
physicists pride ourselves in this culture

908
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:57,200
of we only talk about real stuff we can touch and measure,

909
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:01,240
but cosmology really disrupts that.

910
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:04,200
It's really hard to write down theories

911
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,760
with the tools we have

912
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:11,040
that allow us to limit ourselves that way.

913
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,840
And I'm actually really intrigued by David's angle,

914
01:13:14,840 --> 01:13:19,200
which seems to be to take that

915
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,360
as a judgment of our ideas about physical laws,

916
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:26,600
if I understand that, which I find fascinating.

917
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:31,040
I've come at a lot of these ideas

918
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,320
from the point of view that physics

919
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,080
has nothing to do with infinity,

920
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,760
because you'll only ever collect finite data

921
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:42,960
and you'll only ever shape

922
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,920
the only stuff you have to work with is finite

923
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,680
in terms of having finite data and so on.

924
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:56,760
And what I'm hearing, I'm very directly from David

925
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,000
and I think implicitly,

926
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,400
or maybe directly too from Charlie.

927
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,240
Anyway, I'm hearing in both your comments

928
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,800
that the problem of the arrow of time

929
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,560
or the problem of bolts and brains

930
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,360
or however you wanna put it

931
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,800
is looming enough to transcend.

932
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,640
That's forcing us away from that position.

933
01:14:20,360 --> 01:14:22,360
Making us love infinity.

934
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:27,360
Yeah, and I will say that whatever,

935
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:32,520
wherever I am in my prejudices and all of that with that,

936
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:36,760
I think that problem looms so mightily

937
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,200
that I have to respect.

938
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,640
Even though you're doing stuff that I find uncomfortable,

939
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,800
that problem looms so mightily that I respect.

940
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,840
It's very radical to me,

941
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:54,440
it's very radical what you're trying to do,

942
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,480
but something has to give.

943
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,360
Oscar Wilde said, we're all in the gutter,

944
01:15:00,360 --> 01:15:03,080
but some of us are looking at the stars.

945
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:06,040
Well, some of us are looking at infinity,

946
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,680
because it solves problems here and now.

947
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:13,520
But it seems to me like a cheat.

948
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:14,680
That's, I think that's,

949
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,640
so I think you're also giving up.

950
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,720
So, and I think you're explicitly saying

951
01:15:18,720 --> 01:15:23,240
that you're giving up on the standard ways

952
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,240
we think about doing physics.

953
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:30,240
And whether it's embracing some beautiful, better thing

954
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:33,520
or giving up is a little hard for me to tell.

955
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:36,760
We've embraced the continuum for centuries.

956
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,480
Yeah, just a derivative that we do in classical.

957
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:40,320
And derivatives, yes.

958
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,240
But it doesn't, but it's for, okay,

959
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:47,800
but that's only to make our life easier.

960
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:51,880
And if it were discreet instead, it wouldn't change it.

961
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,720
It wouldn't be a radical thing to put it on a lattice.

962
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,640
We're not here to make our lives easier,

963
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,280
we're here to understand the world.

964
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,520
And that's why these continuums and derivatives

965
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:07,080
and all that infinite stuff was invented, was conjectured.

966
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,080
And it might be false, but it might not be.

967
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:11,880
Well, you shouldn't have prejudices about these things.

968
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,880
But our, yes, that's fine.

969
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:19,640
I like your line.

970
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:24,640
I find the finiteness of physics.

971
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:30,280
Physics is finite, except you're saying,

972
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:33,760
what I'm hearing is, okay, physics might be finite,

973
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,120
but except for the arrow of time problem, forcing us out.

974
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:40,640
I don't think the continuum forces us to infinity.

975
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,640
We can have a lattice,

976
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,520
we can have all kinds of things that do just fine.

977
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,360
But you're saying this is the one thing

978
01:16:46,360 --> 01:16:50,880
that forces us to think about infinity, which is intriguing.

979
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,800
I'd like to go in the audience

980
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,920
and give the chance for some students to ask questions.

981
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,280
If any one of you have a question.

982
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:02,280
Hi.

983
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:07,280
I'm not sure whether I understood why

984
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,280
incompleteness is fundamental for non-equilibrium phenomena

985
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:14,280
and so forth life.

986
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,280
I think it was a point of David that he made before.

987
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,280
Yeah.

988
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:22,280
So I'd like maybe more comments about that.

989
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,280
No, thank you.

990
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,280
Cool.

991
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:25,280
Thanks.

992
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:28,280
David, would you like to react?

993
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:30,280
I'm sure Charlie could do this better.

994
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:38,280
But, but I, I, the connection is that if you have to look

995
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:44,280
at the contrapositive, if there is a limitation

996
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:49,280
such as Hilbert imagined,

997
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,280
that you can write out an algorithm

998
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,280
that will be a criterion of truth,

999
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:03,280
then mathematics has stopped at that point.

1000
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,280
And the same would be true of physics.

1001
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:13,280
If, if, if there was a knowable law of physics

1002
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,280
that predicted everything,

1003
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,280
then that would be the end of physics.

1004
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:21,280
And if there were such a thing as,

1005
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:26,280
and if there were such a thing as life in a universe,

1006
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,280
which I think there couldn't be, but if, if there were,

1007
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:33,280
then it would really mean that the design of the most

1008
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,280
complicated creature that could exist,

1009
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:38,280
which would be finitely complicated,

1010
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:43,280
would exist baked into the, to the laws of physics

1011
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:45,280
at the big bang.

1012
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:50,280
So, you know, the, the, the universe would not have anything

1013
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:54,280
that would not have any of the kinds of openness,

1014
01:18:54,280 --> 01:19:00,280
explain the complexity and the, all the high level structure.

1015
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:09,280
If, if it were not, if, if, if there were infallible truths

1016
01:19:09,280 --> 01:19:13,280
available that the other way around,

1017
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,280
unless there were fallibility.

1018
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:20,280
So, Charlie, yeah.

1019
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:22,280
Yeah, I think that's right.

1020
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:28,280
That, that is that if, if you didn't have,

1021
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:32,280
it's because

1022
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:36,280
incompleteness is the flip side of universality.

1023
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:41,280
If you had a, if you restricted the,

1024
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:47,280
the laws of nature to, to something in which you couldn't

1025
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:51,280
produce a universal computer,

1026
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:55,280
of course it would be limited by how long it could run before,

1027
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,280
but basically something that was behaving like a Turing machine

1028
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,280
until some, some part broke.

1029
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:06,280
Then you couldn't get something as complicated as, as, as a,

1030
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:13,280
a, a bacterium.

1031
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,280
Thanks.

1032
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:19,280
Are there any other questions from the audience?

1033
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:30,280
Yeah, Vincent, would you like to come?

1034
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,280
So, hello, thank you so much for the great discussion.

1035
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,280
Maybe I have a question about a bit of a different topic,

1036
01:20:36,280 --> 01:20:39,280
namely about artificial intelligence and AGI maybe,

1037
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,280
because some of us are interested in this.

1038
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:47,280
So from the Turing church thesis,

1039
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,280
we know that our brains are not doing anything magical.

1040
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:53,280
They could be simulated by a Turing machine, right?

1041
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:55,280
So that means, in principle, some,

1042
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,280
we could implement something like AGI if you,

1043
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,280
if we would know how,

1044
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:04,280
but it could be that the only way, at least in my view,

1045
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,280
the only way to implement this is to simulate something

1046
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:10,280
like a human brain on a Turing machine,

1047
01:21:10,280 --> 01:21:13,280
not that there's any simple AGI program that does something

1048
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:16,280
like human level intelligence or creativity,

1049
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:21,280
or maybe there is any reason we might get there,

1050
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,280
or do you think there is any reason that we should expect

1051
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,280
a simple program that implements AGI,

1052
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,280
or is, do we have to take the detour

1053
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,280
to simulate something like a human brain,

1054
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,280
and this then...

1055
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,280
Well, the human brain might be simple,

1056
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,280
looked at the right way.

1057
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,280
I think simple doesn't necessarily mean easy to find.

1058
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,280
I think there is a very strong reason to believe

1059
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:50,280
that the explanatory universality property

1060
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:56,280
of the human brain, which are present only humans have,

1061
01:21:56,280 --> 01:22:01,280
must be encoded in a very short amount of DNA,

1062
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,280
a tiny amount.

1063
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,280
People have different numbers for this,

1064
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:10,280
but we seem to be 95% or 99% of our DNA

1065
01:22:10,280 --> 01:22:13,280
is the same as chimpanzees,

1066
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:16,280
and of the rest, a lot is junk DNA,

1067
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:20,280
and of the rest, a lot is differences between us

1068
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,280
and chimpanzees that aren't connected

1069
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:26,280
with these deep epistemological things.

1070
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:32,280
So maybe it's only a few K of code in DNA terms

1071
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:38,280
that encodes the AGI-ness or the GI-ness of the brain,

1072
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:41,280
but that doesn't mean it's easy to find.

1073
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,280
I would guess that it is a short program.

1074
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:49,280
I mean, a few K of program is actually long if you want to write it,

1075
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:55,280
but it's relatively short compared with the kinds of things

1076
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,280
that happen in biology.

1077
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:01,280
And I think it'll be very hard to find,

1078
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:05,280
and probably, well, I would expect us to find it

1079
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:11,280
only once we have understood a philosophical theory

1080
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,280
of what the function is,

1081
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:20,280
what the creativity, consciousness, qualia, and so on,

1082
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:25,280
what those things are in some precise terms,

1083
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,280
precise but high level, I would expect.

1084
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,280
And then we can probably quite easily write a program

1085
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:35,280
that has that property.

1086
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,280
Then we'll be in various kinds of trouble,

1087
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,280
but not any of the kinds of trouble

1088
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:42,280
that people are thinking about now.

1089
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:47,280
I worry that people who know more about it

1090
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:56,280
are scared about it, but people are so good

1091
01:23:56,280 --> 01:24:00,280
at being cruel to each other with their intelligence

1092
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:06,280
that I doubt that the machines would do much worse.

1093
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:12,280
And I take this Schopenhauer's principle,

1094
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:15,280
which is what they should call the anthropic principle

1095
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:21,280
pretty seriously, and it may be that we're not likely

1096
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:30,280
to last more than a few or decades before we...

1097
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,280
I don't think that human civilization will extinct itself,

1098
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:40,280
it might set us back a few centuries or millennia.

1099
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:46,280
And we just hope for the best, but...

1100
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:52,280
So that's why I don't worry about it so much,

1101
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,280
but maybe I should.

1102
01:24:55,280 --> 01:25:00,280
Oh, I know, it's also, if you want to be universal,

1103
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,280
not in the sense of computational universality,

1104
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:06,280
but in the sense of the Universal Declaration

1105
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,280
of Human Rights, where do we get off thinking

1106
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:14,280
that we have better rights than these machines?

1107
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,280
They might actually do a better job,

1108
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:21,280
or they might be our successors,

1109
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:27,280
not in the sense of the ones that conquered us

1110
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:33,280
and enslaved us, but in a way that provided a shortcut

1111
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:38,280
to what may be...

1112
01:25:38,280 --> 01:25:45,280
To the bad instincts, or let's say the maladaptive instincts

1113
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:49,280
that humans have, and that it might take a bit

1114
01:25:49,280 --> 01:26:03,280
of very unpleasant natural selection to get rid of,

1115
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:08,280
and maybe the artificial intelligence would make a shortcut to...

1116
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:12,280
So you're saying AI rights might be better people?

1117
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:15,280
Yeah, in other words, another way of doing it

1118
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:18,280
would be giving us a transplant of bonobo genes

1119
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:23,280
or something that just makes us more susceptible

1120
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:27,280
to taking it easy and less susceptible to getting angry

1121
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,280
at our neighbors because of misinformation

1122
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:33,280
we've heard about them and going on killing them,

1123
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:38,280
which seems to be the tendency people have,

1124
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:41,280
which probably was very adaptive at one stage,

1125
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:47,280
but is not helping us right now.

1126
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,280
Thanks.

1127
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:50,280
You can't believe that in the better angels of our nature,

1128
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:53,280
and Steven Pinker and all that stuff,

1129
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,280
he says we've been getting better and better.

1130
01:26:56,280 --> 01:27:00,280
Look, if civilization...

1131
01:27:00,280 --> 01:27:02,280
No, that's tendency,

1132
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:05,280
but there are also strong tendencies in the other direction.

1133
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,280
We saw in the 20th century it got pretty bad,

1134
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,280
and it could do so again.

1135
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:16,280
It's worse now because the reach of things

1136
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:19,280
is even more global than it was in the 20th century.

1137
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:23,280
So a very repressive world government

1138
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:29,280
would be harder to dislodge.

1139
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:32,280
There's a more fundamental reason why you're right,

1140
01:27:32,280 --> 01:27:35,280
namely because of fallibilism.

1141
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:40,280
There can be no upper bound to the size of error we can make.

1142
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:45,280
So although we have the potential

1143
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:52,280
to go exponentially into the future at infinite.

1144
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,280
We have the potential to make arbitrarily large errors,

1145
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:58,280
and we may have a dark age and another dark age,

1146
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:00,280
and a dark age lasting a million years,

1147
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:02,280
or we might wipe ourselves out,

1148
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,280
and something else might evolve somewhere else in the universe

1149
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,280
or somewhere else in the multiverse.

1150
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:11,280
And there can be no guarantee that that won't happen.

1151
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,280
There can be no even...

1152
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:18,280
There can be no guarantee that it probably won't happen.

1153
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:23,280
So what we have to do is solve problems as we find them

1154
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:26,280
and create knowledge as we can,

1155
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:35,280
and not rely on supernatural guarantees.

1156
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:41,280
I thought you'd like that point about the finite bound.

1157
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:46,280
Are there any other questions from the audience?

1158
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:50,280
Adita?

1159
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:58,280
I'm changing chairs depending on which side people come.

1160
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:02,280
Hi, so I had a question because of this discussion

1161
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:07,280
we spent about discussing about how undecidability

1162
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,280
and the halting problem are, I guess, flip sides of the same problem.

1163
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,280
Would you also say that...

1164
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:13,280
Universality.

1165
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:16,280
Sorry, yeah, universality and the halting problem

1166
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:19,280
are the kind of opposite sides of the same problem.

1167
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:23,280
Would you also say that these are opposite sides of induction

1168
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,280
and deduction as ways to kind of acquire knowledge,

1169
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:29,280
because we talked about, I guess,

1170
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:32,280
Solmanov induction a little bit in the beginning

1171
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:37,280
and how maybe that is one conceptualization

1172
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,280
of how you could derive knowledge from...

1173
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:43,280
Instead of using deduction from a formal set of axioms,

1174
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,280
where you would use data instead.

1175
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:50,280
So would you say that the incompatibility of something

1176
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:55,280
like ideal induction is the same as not being able to deduce

1177
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:58,280
because of incompleteness?

1178
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:02,280
Yes, they are both impossible for the same reason

1179
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:06,280
and their impossibility is a very good thing for the same reason.

1180
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:11,280
So in both cases, instead of deriving things,

1181
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,280
we have to guess things, we have to conjecture,

1182
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:17,280
and the conjectures are always fallible.

1183
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:21,280
And I'm spouting Popper's philosophy here,

1184
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:24,280
so that's where you have to go for this.

1185
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:29,280
And he got an amazing number of things right

1186
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:34,280
working almost in isolation.

1187
01:30:34,280 --> 01:30:36,280
To link to relate to Adita's point,

1188
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:39,280
I think also Solmanov's induction is an idealization,

1189
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,280
and to have Solmanov's metric,

1190
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,280
one needs to solve the halting problem.

1191
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,280
But in concrete applications,

1192
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:49,280
one cannot find Solmanov's prior.

1193
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:52,280
And so what we do, as you know,

1194
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,280
upper semi-computed perhaps,

1195
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:57,280
and then come up with guesses,

1196
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:01,280
oh, maybe this phenomenon from which I got these data

1197
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:04,280
has been explained by this program.

1198
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,280
Now everything is programs,

1199
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,280
but one can come up with this.

1200
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,280
That's also a problem,

1201
01:31:12,280 --> 01:31:15,280
how we link scientific explanations with programs.

1202
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:19,280
But I think there is a bit of a Popperian flavor

1203
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,280
in Solmanov's induction once we realize

1204
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:24,280
that it's uncomputable, so forget it.

1205
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,280
It's a beautiful idea.

1206
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:28,280
It does converge to whatever it needs to converge.

1207
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:30,280
But the fact that it's uncomputable,

1208
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,280
we can only guess programs.

1209
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:36,280
The thing is, usually, or often, shall I say,

1210
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:41,280
often the problem we're trying to solve isn't in data.

1211
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,280
We haven't yet got any data.

1212
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:46,280
Sometimes it's a theoretical problem.

1213
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:52,280
I think how is it possible for Maxwell's equations to be true

1214
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:55,280
and geometry to be what we think it is?

1215
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,280
There's no data, no data at all.

1216
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:04,280
So you have the problem first, then the theory, then the data.

1217
01:32:04,280 --> 01:32:10,280
And so induction of any kind simply can't exist

1218
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:13,280
in that kind of a reality.

1219
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:19,280
And as I keep saying, it's a very good thing that it can't.

1220
01:32:19,280 --> 01:32:24,280
So Solmanov is trying to solve a problem that isn't there.

1221
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:27,280
He's trying to say, how can we make this induction

1222
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:32,280
or this Bayesian inference or whatever make sense?

1223
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,280
How can we get the priors right?

1224
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:36,280
Well, the priors aren't right.

1225
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:39,280
Get over it.

1226
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:46,280
Well, my colleague, John Smolen, told me about the story of induction

1227
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:56,280
and about an explorer who comes to a place that's inhabited by anti-inductionists.

1228
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:00,280
And these are people who believe that if something happened once,

1229
01:33:00,280 --> 01:33:03,280
it's less likely to happen again.

1230
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:10,280
And they have a miserable life because their buildings fall down

1231
01:33:10,280 --> 01:33:12,280
and their crops fail.

1232
01:33:12,280 --> 01:33:18,280
And so this explorer says, I understand why everything is not working here.

1233
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:25,280
It's because your principle of anti-induction is wrong.

1234
01:33:25,280 --> 01:33:27,280
And they looked at him and they said,

1235
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:29,280
why should we give up this principle?

1236
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:32,280
It's never worked before.

1237
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:36,280
Nice.

1238
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:37,280
Good.

1239
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:38,280
Thank you.

1240
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:43,280
Thank you so much for your answers.

1241
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:46,280
Other questions?

1242
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:50,280
Sam.

1243
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,280
I'm interested in what kinds of cosmology.

1244
01:33:53,280 --> 01:34:02,280
I mean, we have the cosmology for people like Hitler.

1245
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,280
There's Barbas cosmology.

1246
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:06,280
Let's try to get them again.

1247
01:34:06,280 --> 01:34:09,280
I'm just curious what interests them at the moment.

1248
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:15,280
Well, I don't know a lot about it, but I've been trying to understand these models.

1249
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:20,280
They call eternal inflation where there isn't a beginning or an end,

1250
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:26,280
but in which there's inflating pockets that appear here and there

1251
01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:29,280
with all sorts of different natural laws in them.

1252
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:36,280
And in that, that's a pretty scary place to live.

1253
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:41,280
And it's populated by all kinds of problems, like David mentioned,

1254
01:34:41,280 --> 01:34:49,280
that it's hard to get a universe in which you're not extremely

1255
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:59,280
likely to disappear in a microsecond from now.

1256
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:06,280
Other questions from the group?

1257
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:10,280
If they come up later, be free to feel free to raise your hand at some point.

1258
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:15,280
And at this stage, I could also take questions from the, from the online event.

1259
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:19,280
I would have a quick question.

1260
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,280
Go ahead, Sophie.

1261
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,280
Yes.

1262
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:30,280
I'm wondering when you're talking about other universes that would have maybe

1263
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:33,280
they could solve the whole thing problem and for them, it's pretty easy,

1264
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:38,280
but for us, it's difficult and vice versa for other tasks.

1265
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:46,280
Are you thinking about other branches in the multiverse or something that

1266
01:35:46,280 --> 01:35:49,280
would be completely outside of what we are studying now?

1267
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:51,280
The latter.

1268
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:59,280
In the multiverse, there's no, all universes in the quantum multiverse

1269
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:02,280
have the same tame mathematics.

1270
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:07,280
They even have the same computable functions.

1271
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:13,280
They just have different complexity theory, but complexity theory isn't that important anyway.

1272
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:23,280
So, yeah, but, but we have to, we have to consider universes with different laws,

1273
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:30,280
if only to, to examine explanations like the anthropic principle, which purport to

1274
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:40,280
different things in our universe and only, only certain very special kinds of anthropic argument constitute arguments.

1275
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:55,280
They, otherwise they, they simply fall victim to this Boltzmann brain or boundary of the, of the set of possibilities problem.

1276
01:36:55,280 --> 01:37:14,280
In his Sharma, when he was, when he told us about this objection, he said that what we should really look for anthropically is for is a case, not not a case where a slight change in a fundamental law would have meant that we're not here,

1277
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:19,280
but where the, but where we are located at the center of the region.

1278
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:30,280
So, if we, if we really define structure constant, rather than saying, you know, if it was 1% different, we wouldn't be here.

1279
01:37:30,280 --> 01:37:37,280
Look at the region where we would be here and, and try to find out whether we're near the center.

1280
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:43,280
If we're near the center, that, that is a real anthropic problem.

1281
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:50,280
You know, if you tell this to religious people, they're going to say it's God, and it's very hard to argue them out of it.

1282
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:54,280
But I don't think we will be in the center.

1283
01:37:54,280 --> 01:38:03,280
But I think you don't think we're also on the edges, because if we're on the edges, we're out of it right after where we're neither at the center of the edges because that's not where the explanation lies.

1284
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:12,280
The explanation of the actual values doesn't doesn't lie in our existence.

1285
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:22,280
It's a common cause is caused by things like the law of the, of the universality of computation.

1286
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:24,280
I was about to say side effect. Yeah.

1287
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:25,280
Yeah.

1288
01:38:25,280 --> 01:38:28,280
Yeah.

1289
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:33,280
Thank you.

1290
01:38:33,280 --> 01:38:34,280
Are there other questions.

1291
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:41,280
We're not at the middle and we're not at the edge exactly how far from the edge are we.

1292
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:51,280
Probably a non computable amount or an intractably computable amount.

1293
01:38:51,280 --> 01:39:05,280
David, I'm just curious. This is a small question, but I'm just curious. So your comments about the thought the sort of unpredictability of the future of our civilization and the possibility of our demise.

1294
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:11,280
Is that, is that the same thing as this edge that we've been talking about?

1295
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:13,280
Do you see a difference?

1296
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,280
Yeah, yeah.

1297
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:25,280
It's almost the opposite. It's, it's the, it's to do with our fallibility, which is to do with our capacity for infinite growth.

1298
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,280
Good.

1299
01:39:26,280 --> 01:39:29,280
That's, that's interesting. Yeah.

1300
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:37,280
So it's, it's, it's our hope as well as our possible demise.

1301
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:49,280
Well, you know, I'm not expecting our possible demise. I think, you know, arguing that there will be a dis demise is itself not legitimate. That's a prophecy.

1302
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:54,280
No, no, no, but, but it's in the scope, but, but it's, it's not.

1303
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:58,280
You're saying we can't be sure to avoid it.

1304
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:03,280
Yeah, it's, it's on the future of knowledge is unknowable.

1305
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:07,280
Again, we've got to get over that.

1306
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:17,280
That's, you're saying, unlike other predictions, it's not false survival because if, if, if there is a demise.

1307
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:34,280
I think, I think Gilles Brassard was wrote a book on your computation in which it had a cartoon of a bunch of elderly scientists looking into a steaming test tube.

1308
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:45,280
And one of them is saying, we may have discovered the elixir of immortality, but it will take forever to test it.

1309
01:40:46,280 --> 01:40:57,280
Any more questions.

1310
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:01,280
I would have another question maybe for Charles.

1311
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:07,280
And I wonder what's your view of probabilities.

1312
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:09,280
My view of probability.

1313
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,280
Yep.

1314
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:27,280
I think it's just, I think it arises from entanglement.

1315
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:45,280
Yes, I think that is the, the problem is, is the feature of a subsystem in a, in a larger system that, that evolves uniterally.

1316
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:56,280
My question would also could also be formulated as do you agree with David in terms of what our probabilities, and I guess the answer is yes.

1317
01:41:56,280 --> 01:42:05,280
Not necessarily because many people view probabilities as entanglement because they understand quantum theory as unitary and so entanglement is out there.

1318
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:12,280
But even, even among these people, there's still many disagreements about how we should read the born rule.

1319
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:23,280
So, so maybe the follow up question for Charlie without, without being so specific as does it equate to David's, despite you embrace unitary quantum theory.

1320
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:27,280
Still, how do you view the born rule.

1321
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,280
Is it a decision.

1322
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:41,280
Yeah, it's, it's, it's hard. I try not to think about it, but I know.

1323
01:42:41,280 --> 01:42:45,280
Do we have an answer on that.

1324
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:56,280
Yes, I think, I think the decision theory approach to probability in quantum mechanics is correct and sufficient.

1325
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:11,280
Whether you whether you call that deriving the born rule. I don't know, I think the born rule is a is not a universal rule obviously because it doesn't apply to quantum theory.

1326
01:43:11,280 --> 01:43:20,280
I mean, it only applies to quantum theory at a tiny minority of of in a tiny minority of situations.

1327
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:29,280
In those situations, modeling the, the situation with decision theory.

1328
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:41,280
The decision theory theory approach if I can say very quickly is to take decision classical decision theory and quantum theory strip out all the probability from classical decision theory.

1329
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:59,280
All the probabilistic axioms and so on. And then quantum theory strip out the probabilistic, you know, if you're going to have wave function collapse or something strip out all that stuff, anything that's supposed to be probabilistic, then smush them together.

1330
01:44:00,280 --> 01:44:14,280
Consistent quantum theory, namely Everett's, and you get a consistent theory probability, which only applies when people are making decisions.

1331
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:23,280
And the rule that they use assuming that they make measurements accurately and all that stuff in that approximation.

1332
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:40,280
Their rational behavior as determined by decision theory is the same as it would be if they believed in stochastic processes, even those stochastic processes do not happen in nature.

1333
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:50,280
Yeah, that sounds pretty plausible.

1334
01:44:50,280 --> 01:45:03,280
I'm not sure I properly understood your explanation, David, because if you say you want to get rid of the born rule and you believe in a unitary quantum mechanics and and Everett's many worlds interpretation.

1335
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:20,280
How do you reconcile the fact that when we do a quantum experiment in the lab, we, you know, we just get to see one result. How do we, how do we interpret the fact that we're in just a specific branch of the multiverse and say not another one.

1336
01:45:20,280 --> 01:45:38,280
Why not? We're in all of them. And the fact that we see only one outcome is a prediction of quantum theory. If you if you just write the equation for with the variable for how many outcomes do we see, then you will find that the world after a good measurement, the world will be in an

1337
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:42,280
eigenstate of that with eigenvalue one.

1338
01:45:42,280 --> 01:45:49,280
Okay, so what actually happens is that all of the outcomes happen. I mean, generically.

1339
01:45:50,280 --> 01:46:00,280
But the question was about probability. What do we then mean that some of them have a high prior probability than others, given that they all happen.

1340
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:13,280
Then you have to bring in another part of the model, which is, suppose we were betting on these outcomes. How would it be rational to bet.

1341
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:25,280
And decision theory without probabilistic axioms and quantum theory without them together, give the answer.

1342
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:31,280
It's magic.

1343
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:38,280
You're shaking your head, but if you read the papers, it's, it's, I think it's unanswerable.

1344
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:41,280
I mean, it's, it's undeniable.

1345
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:48,280
Do you think it's unanswerable or just we haven't found a good explanation for it. Yes.

1346
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:55,280
It's too ambiguous at word. I mean, it's undeniable that this is the explanation.

1347
01:46:55,280 --> 01:47:05,280
So, David has amidst his other euphemisms and disphemisms.

1348
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:31,280
And what is, I regard the, the, the most widespread obfuscatory euphemism God, that is, people, people use it to mean their own idea of God, which they're going to try to get you to like and believe in, but they haven't actually said what it is yet.

1349
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:37,280
So, I'm going to use that also, but in a physicist's way.

1350
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:50,280
So, if you imagine a conversation with God, and, and first of all, you say, what time is it. And God says, well, you would say it's it's about here.

1351
01:47:51,280 --> 01:48:02,280
It's about 1037 Eastern daylight time. But for me, it's all times. I'm eternal.

1352
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:10,280
And then you'll say, well, you're supposed to be omniscient of will it rain a year from now.

1353
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:17,280
And God says, well, that's like, yes and no.

1354
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:27,280
Well, it rained for me from now. Well, I say, it's like saying what I see is, is something that looks like your hand.

1355
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:35,280
And you're sitting here, and you're saying, which of my fingers is the correct extension of my wrist.

1356
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:46,280
They all are, when it gets to be next year, you'll either be on one where it's raining, which is the one that has my wedding ring, or you'll be one of the other ones where it isn't raining.

1357
01:48:47,280 --> 01:49:07,280
And I can see all of them. But, but, and, and you, for you now, they're all equally real. And then in a next year, you will have a kind of a truncated perspective in which you think one of them is real and the others aren't, but they all still are.

1358
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:16,280
I'm not going to think that I know that the other branches exist, even if I can't see them.

1359
01:49:16,280 --> 01:49:19,280
Most things in the universe I can't see.

1360
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:22,280
I don't know why that's so, so.

1361
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:38,280
It's like this, what Galileo said, he says, I don't know if he actually said this, but he says that it's a yes, I say that the earth moves and if it moves the way I say it is you shouldn't be able to feel it moving so shut up.

1362
01:49:38,280 --> 01:49:40,280
Yeah, pretty much.

1363
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:43,280
Ever said that to do it. Yes.

1364
01:49:43,280 --> 01:49:46,280
Yeah, yeah, you didn't use the Galileo example.

1365
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:54,280
Yes, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. And is that the moment where David started to say, Okay, I don't know what more to argue against.

1366
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:59,280
Yeah, that's the moment he was convinced. Yeah.

1367
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:04,280
So, so the idea is even the theory says

1368
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:07,280
Yes, you will only experience one outcome.

1369
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:08,280
Yes.

1370
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:18,280
So, even though we seem to be bugged by the fact that no, but the theory says there's going to be many outcomes. No, no, no, it might look like the theory says there's going to be many outcomes.

1371
01:50:18,280 --> 01:50:26,280
But if, if each of, if you ask yourself what how many outcomes am I going to see the theory says systematically only one.

1372
01:50:26,280 --> 01:50:37,280
So it preserves its consistency in spite of its striking apparent inconsistency.

1373
01:50:38,280 --> 01:50:45,280
And are there other questions.

1374
01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:48,280
Hey, do you hear me.

1375
01:50:48,280 --> 01:51:02,280
Yeah, so, so will you will you say well any of you say that in that sense, in the sense we just discussed now, the principle will be a statement about consciousness of what do you experience.

1376
01:51:02,280 --> 01:51:10,280
Or do you think it's beyond like consciousness will be beyond the scope of the statement.

1377
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:27,280
It has nothing to do with it. It's, I mean, obviously, if consciousness is to be described as a physical process which it must be, then it presumably a base quantum theory and so on but it has nothing to do with these issues of

1378
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:35,280
measurement probability and anything like that it's it's just a physical thing.

1379
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:46,280
There's there's no more reason to assume it has a special place in physics, then it would be to assume that squirrels have a special place in physics.

1380
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:54,280
Obviously they describe that physics, but they don't have any relevance to fundamental discussions of physics.

1381
01:51:54,280 --> 01:52:08,280
Well, I asked before, because the idea was like, I mean, the, the following if I'm following the discussion is that, like, you have this different potential outcomes of measurement, all of them occur, all of them have their own branches and all of them are there.

1382
01:52:08,280 --> 01:52:13,280
But the statement is more like the one do you will experience one of them.

1383
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:24,280
And then it's if it's about, you will experience one of them, you will see one of them is wouldn't be addressing directly the consciousness of, or maybe I'm just like going out.

1384
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:42,280
It's the same question can be asked about a seed of a plant that grows into two trees, the left one and the right one and you ask the seed are you going to be the left one or the right one or or twins you know you are are you going to be Joe or Fred.

1385
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:53,280
You ask the, the fertilized egg. And it says to you, well, in a sense, I'm going to be both of them. In a sense, I'm only going to be one of them.

1386
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:57,280
That is to say, I will not experience being both.

1387
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:02,280
But the experience of being each of them will both happen.

1388
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:05,280
Okay, I see. I understand.

1389
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:09,280
That's a good way of putting it. Yeah.

1390
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:15,280
Well, David and Charlie have been tremendously generous of their time.

1391
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:26,280
It doesn't seems like there's other questions. If somebody has a burning desire and has been repressing his question. This is the last call.

1392
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,280
It also applies for the audience.

1393
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:30,280
Great.

1394
01:53:30,280 --> 01:53:43,280
Thank you so much, David and Charlie. That was a lot of fun to discuss with you. And it was a very, very fascinating in many regards.

1395
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:48,280
Thank you very much. Very, very interesting conversation.

1396
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,280
Thank you. Hi everyone.

1397
01:53:50,280 --> 01:53:51,280
Thanks a lot. This was great.
