WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
So, welcome everyone. I am Charles BÃ©dard. I'll be your host today. I'm a postdoctoral

00:05.840 --> 00:10.860
researcher at Universitat de la Switzerland Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland. And today

00:10.860 --> 00:16.720
I have the pleasure to be animating a conversation between Charles Bennett and David Deutsch

00:16.720 --> 00:23.880
on the nature of computation, incompleteness, and mathematics. I'll please ask everyone

00:23.880 --> 00:30.000
who's not David or Charlie to mute themselves so that we don't hear any background, any

00:30.000 --> 00:37.040
noise in the background. So that means that among the Charles, that includes yourself,

00:37.040 --> 00:47.320
right? Yeah, I'll keep myself unmuted, correct. I'll be animating the conversation for around

00:47.320 --> 00:53.440
one hour, and then I'll open it up for the audience to ask questions and jump in. Well,

00:53.440 --> 00:59.520
let me introduce our guests to continue. We have Charles Bennett. He's an IBM Fellow

00:59.520 --> 01:06.960
at the IBM Research and a Fellow of the American Physical Society. He has been awarded the

01:06.960 --> 01:13.160
2023 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics for his pioneer work on quantum information.

01:13.160 --> 01:18.720
Throughout his career... Well, not just me. What about David Deutsch? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18.720 --> 01:24.280
I was just thinking because he's with us, so I'll have to come up with him at some point.

01:24.280 --> 01:28.600
So the breakthrough prize was, in fact, shared between Charlie, David Deutsch, so two of our

01:28.600 --> 01:35.960
speakers today, and Gilles Brassard and Peter Schor. So we have two of them with us today.

01:35.960 --> 01:41.360
So throughout his career, Charlie played an essential role in investigating and clarifying

01:41.360 --> 01:47.320
the roles between the links between information and physics. Among other things, he co-invented

01:47.320 --> 01:52.360
quantum cryptography, he set the basis for quantum information theory, he resolved the

01:52.360 --> 01:58.200
Maxwell-Demons paradox, and he developed logically reversible computation. Charlie, welcome and

01:58.200 --> 02:07.520
thanks for being here. All right, good. Glad that's over. Yeah. What was this? So we also

02:07.520 --> 02:12.840
have David Deutsch visiting. I think actually, as Smolkowski solved Maxwell-Demons problem

02:12.920 --> 02:20.840
and people sort of forgot about it for 50 years. Oh, okay, good. Yeah. Thanks for the note. David

02:20.840 --> 02:25.480
Deutsch is visiting professor of physics at Oxford University, a fellow of the Royal Society and

02:25.480 --> 02:31.000
the Institute of Physics. He has also been awarded the 2023 breakthrough prize in fundamental physics

02:31.000 --> 02:37.160
for his pioneer work on quantum computation. David is mostly known for his discovery of

02:37.160 --> 02:42.440
the universal quantum computer and the first quantum algorithm, yet he's also a pioneer

02:43.240 --> 02:49.080
of constructor theory, and he's made significant contributions to the philosophy of science. David,

02:49.080 --> 02:57.000
thank you and welcome and thank you for being here. Thank you. So I'd like to start the conversation

02:57.000 --> 03:04.360
by discussing the theory of computation. Computers are all around us. Their usefulness in day-to-day

03:04.360 --> 03:09.320
life is now evident, but when it comes to computers and the theory of computation,

03:10.120 --> 03:17.960
what makes me the most intrigued is what computation is fundamentally and physically,

03:18.520 --> 03:24.120
and what role does it play in understanding of the world around us? So, Charlie, I'll address

03:24.120 --> 03:28.440
the first question to you, but eventually hopefully this becomes a conversation. So please, David,

03:28.440 --> 03:32.760
if at some point you want to jump in, please feel free to react like you would in a regular

03:32.760 --> 03:38.840
living room kind of conversation. Charlie, what is the theory of computation all about?

03:40.680 --> 03:52.200
Well, I think it's almost, you shouldn't ask about the computation particularly, but the deep

03:52.200 --> 04:03.480
philosophical question is about the relation between mathematics and the physics, or the way

04:03.480 --> 04:18.040
I pose the problem of cosmology is to find a mathematical home for our classical phenomenon.

04:18.920 --> 04:25.720
So a phenomenon is like a genome. It's the set of phenomena that we are, the world that we inhabit.

04:25.720 --> 04:35.960
So this is both a, it's a problem. Mathematics is a structure which we think is absolute and

04:35.960 --> 04:42.760
independent of anything physical, and yet if we, the goal of cosmology, or of science in general,

04:43.320 --> 04:55.480
is to find a mathematical explanation of the world. In other words, to find a part of this vast

04:56.440 --> 05:06.760
structure that is mathematics within which what we see is, is typical instead of surprising and

05:06.760 --> 05:13.960
puzzling. And I think that's why I've gotten interested in cosmology lately, because there are some

05:14.760 --> 05:25.880
some things that seems to be, have been learned by modern cosmology that make, make it harder to,

05:26.760 --> 05:34.440
to feel that we've solved this problem of finding a, a model of the universe within which, within

05:34.440 --> 05:42.280
which what we see is, is, is, is typical. So this is, this touches on the, on the question of the

05:42.280 --> 05:53.480
distinction between what, what is and what could be, and also on the anthropic principle and what,

05:53.480 --> 06:02.840
what questions that some people have, have asked in terms of, of self-locating uncertainty.

06:03.480 --> 06:11.000
And it's, it also gets into a question that's very ancient in mathematics, which is

06:14.440 --> 06:19.800
in, in, in infinity, the nature of infinity. So the, the big, some big problems in cosmology,

06:19.800 --> 06:26.520
I must say, I, I always go and ask Andres Albrecht, because he's been thinking about cosmology for,

06:26.520 --> 06:34.760
for much longer time. And in, in one of the workshops we, we organized, he said, well,

06:36.920 --> 06:43.560
maybe let's take an hour, an hour now and, and wallow in, in, in prior probabilities or prior,

06:43.560 --> 06:58.280
prior, say this is a field where you never can solve anything. And I, I, one of the main things I,

06:58.280 --> 07:09.160
I got from him was the, the, the attitude of beating as, as, as unsatisfied with your own

07:09.160 --> 07:17.960
ideas as you are with everybody else's. So where was I going with this? But so the problem that,

07:17.960 --> 07:24.200
that I said was, what I think we, one way of trying to approach this is just to, to,

07:26.280 --> 07:32.360
to think of, oh, I was saying that infinity is very important. I think we can kind of prove that

07:32.360 --> 07:43.080
if you have a finite world in thermal equilibrium, you get a very boring world with,

07:44.440 --> 07:51.160
with essentially because of the, the Boltzmann brain problem. And so we can get interesting things

07:52.360 --> 07:58.440
in an infinite system, which we can't get in the finite ones, qualitatively different. And

07:59.240 --> 08:03.640
within that, I would say what I'm trying to find out is how,

08:07.400 --> 08:12.760
how permanent disequilibrium can arise and how from disequilibrium,

08:17.160 --> 08:23.640
complexity in the sense of logical depth can arise and how in that, in, in the system that is

08:23.640 --> 08:34.520
doing that, a science can arise. And I don't ask about consciousness directly, because I think it

08:34.520 --> 08:44.360
may be a, a sort of an illusion. So here we have a whole bunch of people who think they're talking

08:44.440 --> 08:53.960
to each other on the screens or in the room, but, and the, the big philosophical, I guess they call

08:53.960 --> 08:58.920
it the hard problem of consciousness of trying to decide what, what it means that we feel conscious.

09:00.680 --> 09:11.240
Maybe is, is, is asking too much. And it would be easier to say, because our consciousnesses are

09:11.240 --> 09:18.840
not independent of one another. We, we, if a person is raised without contact with other people,

09:18.840 --> 09:25.400
they, they don't learn to think the way, the way we do. And Charlie, I know it's not my turn yet,

09:25.400 --> 09:34.680
but can I just say it is infinity an illusion? Well, I think it's, it's, no, I think infinity is a

09:34.680 --> 09:40.280
math, is a mathematical notion. So I, but I think that you need infinity to get the kind of permanent

09:40.280 --> 09:47.160
disequilibrium that you need to, to, to escape the, the Boltzmann brain problem. You may need it,

09:47.160 --> 09:52.920
but you may have another way of doing it. So, so, so in other words, I would say that instead of

09:52.920 --> 10:01.720
saying, asking questions like, what, is it sort of the Copernican principle to it? Is it unusual

10:01.720 --> 10:08.440
that I, that I'm alive at this moment, or that my observer moments are, are typical? I would just

10:08.440 --> 10:18.280
say the, the entirety of, of terrestrial civilization, or the terrestrial,

10:20.200 --> 10:25.800
even larger than human civilization, the terrestrial, the complexity of the terrestrial world

10:25.800 --> 10:31.560
is something that we can look at a little bit more objectively than saying, speaking of consciousness.

10:31.560 --> 10:36.840
And so we can say, well, maybe whales are conscious in a different way. And that's not

10:36.840 --> 10:44.440
quite a scientific question. But, but I think we need to look for a mathematical model within

10:44.440 --> 10:53.240
which, and I think it's has to be infinite, but maybe I'm wrong, within which what we see is,

10:54.440 --> 11:03.480
is, is typical under a kind of anthropic, as weak as, as weakly as possibly anthropic selection.

11:03.800 --> 11:09.800
Okay, and end of speech, at least, that's sort of the reason why you're invoking infinity,

11:09.800 --> 11:18.040
because then you could have fluctuations. Well, if you have infinitely, yeah, I don't, if I just

11:18.040 --> 11:26.440
have an infinity, let's say, like, like, Boltzmann's idea, which gave rise to the Boltzmann bring,

11:26.760 --> 11:35.320
of just an infinite, almost, not, not even, this is before general relativity, an infinite

11:36.680 --> 11:43.160
universe at equilibrium, then you, you get the Boltzmann brain problem, you get the fact that

11:43.160 --> 11:49.320
you can't believe anything that you see. Because everything happens somewhere. And I think this

11:49.320 --> 11:56.600
problem is, is somewhat better understood in the, in the more modern cosmologies.

11:57.800 --> 12:05.960
But I was looking at very simple cellular automata models, in which by making the model in infinite,

12:05.960 --> 12:12.600
and it's, it's dynamics is reversible, you get something that looks like unbounded complexity

12:12.600 --> 12:20.600
that goes on forever, but it only goes on forever because the model is infinite. And it, therefore,

12:20.600 --> 12:26.840
it can never, it can never equilibrate and get boring. I think I got a, I got a picture of it.

12:26.840 --> 12:35.080
I'll see if I can find an example of the model like that. Here's. Okay, so this is a reversible

12:35.080 --> 12:45.320
cellular automaton. And the time goes horizontally, like that. And there's, there's three,

12:48.600 --> 12:54.360
there's three domains here. It's one dimensional automaton. So this is time history. And these,

12:54.360 --> 12:59.800
these differ just by the reversal of black and white. So there's, there's domain, domain boundaries

12:59.880 --> 13:07.160
that, that collide here, producing this, this complicated thing that just goes on forever,

13:07.160 --> 13:12.920
getting more and more complicated. This, this business up here is an artifact because I was

13:12.920 --> 13:17.240
doing it with periodic boundary conditions. And this was the wraparound. It was beginning to

13:17.240 --> 13:22.680
affect it. But if you do it on an infinite model, at Lattice, it gets. So this is the sort of thing

13:22.680 --> 13:28.120
where you can't get this in a finite model. If you do it in a, in a finite system with local

13:28.120 --> 13:38.120
interactions, you get something that's, that looks more like, here, I'll just do it at the beginning.

13:38.120 --> 13:43.880
Yeah. Same model. Yeah. So it gets, it gets interesting. And then if it, if you run long

13:43.880 --> 13:48.760
enough, it just, it's boring. Okay. And I'll stop the screen share. So that's, that's,

13:50.120 --> 13:56.200
that's why I think infinity is important. But that's just maybe I haven't been familiar enough

13:56.200 --> 14:03.480
with cosmology, but I think the cosmologies, I think, let's see what see what Andy says, but

14:03.480 --> 14:11.480
that I think that the, the, the cosmologies tend to be infinite now of also not have to stop sharing

14:11.480 --> 14:20.360
my screen. Where is that? Yeah. Screen sharing stopped. There it is. Good. Okay. I was expecting

14:20.360 --> 14:25.960
Charlie to throw us into cosmology, but to be honest, I didn't expect on question one, we would go

14:25.960 --> 14:32.360
on to cosmology. Thank you, Charlie. I enjoyed it. David, would you like to react? Like, maybe,

14:32.360 --> 14:36.680
maybe you can either react to Charlie's comments and, and how very as reaction. Yeah.

14:37.880 --> 14:41.960
Perhaps you have a, you can backtrack the question and, and, and retake the theory of

14:41.960 --> 14:47.640
computation. Well, I think that I can, I can react and respond to your question at the same time.

14:48.280 --> 14:55.880
Because I think the, where I disagree with, with Charlie would be right at the beginning,

14:55.880 --> 15:02.040
sort of foundation Lee. Oh, yeah. You remember, you should say the three Rs react, respond and refute.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.760
Simultaneously to save time. Yes.

15:06.760 --> 15:17.560
So I'm, if you ask, what is computation? What is computation in the universe? Well,

15:17.560 --> 15:23.640
what are computers? Well, what is that all about? If I was answering that question,

15:24.840 --> 15:30.920
I would have to have universal and universality right in the first sentence somewhere, because I

15:30.920 --> 15:36.520
think that's what it's all about. Computation is physical. You know, I'm sure we can all agree on

15:36.520 --> 15:45.480
that. But I think there is still a hint of the mathematician's misconception in Charlie's

15:46.440 --> 15:55.800
conception of the computation, computers, physics. So I would say that the, the, the

15:56.760 --> 16:08.120
computation exists, universality exists in, in a particular property of the physical universe.

16:10.200 --> 16:18.920
Namely that the physical universe can accommodate machines, which are universal in the sense that

16:18.920 --> 16:26.680
they can be programmed to mimic any other machine if they run long enough and have enough memory.

16:26.680 --> 16:31.400
And for them to have, to run long enough and have enough memory, they have to be maintained,

16:31.400 --> 16:36.920
they, they, they have to have additional memory added. And so there has to be implicitly,

16:37.720 --> 16:46.200
there is a background of knowledge creation. If, if there is to be a sufficiently powerful

16:46.200 --> 16:52.360
computer, like Turing machine or something, then in the background there has to be knowledge creation.

16:52.360 --> 16:58.840
Just like, I think I first read this in Charlie's thing, like what would happen if you found a fountain

16:58.840 --> 17:05.960
pen on the moon, then it would, it would tell you a massive amount. It would tell you that you,

17:05.960 --> 17:15.080
it'd been settled by people from the 19th century. Yes. Yes. Most likely. And it's very, very unlikely

17:15.080 --> 17:21.320
that it formed spontaneously. And so the most likely explanation for it would be that there

17:21.320 --> 17:26.920
had been a civilization. You could, you could infer a lot about the civilization by, as you say,

17:27.800 --> 17:35.160
it's a 19th century type civilization. And, and you can analyze the ink and therefore see what kind

17:35.160 --> 17:43.320
of squids they had there. And, and so on. So this, another thing that this

17:45.320 --> 17:51.720
illustrates, which you didn't mention, is that there's an intimate connection between emergent,

17:52.440 --> 17:59.320
simple emergent properties and simple microscopic quantities. In fact, there are

17:59.400 --> 18:06.680
laws about emergent properties. And the laws about evolution and knowledge and so on are among

18:06.680 --> 18:16.040
the ones we would use to analyze the origin of this fountain pen. So the, we would, we would,

18:19.960 --> 18:26.600
we would gain a lot of knowledge about microscopic information from some macroscopic

18:26.600 --> 18:37.800
information and macroscopic laws. Now, so I haven't mentioned mathematics. No, no. And the

18:37.800 --> 18:42.680
reason I haven't mentioned mathematics, even though I totally agree that there's a mathematical world

18:42.680 --> 18:49.160
that's sort of super infinitely large and that world contains all possible functions and all

18:49.160 --> 18:56.360
possible laws and all possible mathematical objects, the vast majority of which we cannot

18:56.360 --> 19:03.800
even describe. The ones we can describe are basically the ones that are computable by these

19:03.800 --> 19:14.200
machines, which are universal within our universe. So it's no good trying to explain that via

19:15.160 --> 19:21.400
what is going to be likely, what you are going to be likely to see, because what is typical,

19:22.040 --> 19:27.320
what is probable and so on, that those are all determined by the laws of physics. There is no

19:27.960 --> 19:36.440
mathematical notion of probability that applies to physics, unless we have a law of physics saying

19:36.440 --> 19:49.080
so. And in some cases we do and in some cases we don't. And even when we do so, and where we do

19:49.080 --> 19:58.760
have a probabilistic theory of something, the anthropic principle alone doesn't contain any

19:58.760 --> 20:04.120
information about what the laws of physics are. I, this is an argument that I got from Dennis

20:04.120 --> 20:12.440
Sharma a long time ago with his reaction to Brandon Carter's famous paper about the anthropic

20:12.440 --> 20:20.680
principle. The thing is, if you think of this as how do we fix what the dimensionless constants are,

20:22.760 --> 20:28.840
or just the laws themselves, you could think of the laws themselves as being

20:28.840 --> 20:34.040
enumerated, like in Solomonov induction, you know, so we have all possible laws and

20:35.240 --> 20:42.680
so on. And you ask, given what we see, what is the most likely, that is all

20:42.680 --> 20:50.520
inapplicable to fundamental physics, because at least not via the anthropic principle, because

20:50.520 --> 20:55.240
if you think of the set of all the class or whatever it is, the set of all

20:58.840 --> 21:03.720
universes consistent with something, like something consistent with the fountain pen on the moon,

21:03.720 --> 21:09.400
or consistent with what we see, or whatever you want to say, consistent with the existence of

21:09.400 --> 21:21.720
computers, almost all of them are on the very near the boundary of that set. They are almost

21:21.720 --> 21:28.280
all of, because the larger the dimension of the set, the more of it is contained near its boundary.

21:28.280 --> 21:35.720
So, if the only reason why we're here is that we're anthropically selected, then it's overwhelmingly

21:35.720 --> 21:42.120
likely that we're going to die in the next nanosecond, or picosecond, I suppose. It depends

21:43.240 --> 21:51.000
where the chaos, how fast the chaos is going to come in on us. And since we haven't that theory

21:51.400 --> 21:59.880
hereby refuted. So, that's not the way to get the answer. I think the way to get an answer

21:59.880 --> 22:07.960
is not to try to derive microscopic properties that will then give you the desired emergent

22:07.960 --> 22:15.480
properties. It is to think of emergent laws, which, among other things, will give you microscopic

22:15.480 --> 22:21.000
laws, as well as microscopic initial conditions like the ones that produced that fountain pen.

22:21.800 --> 22:29.800
You see, Charlie, your example has lived with me for decades, and this has changed me deeply.

22:30.760 --> 22:36.040
Well, I was thinking of an ordinary ballpoint pen set, but you put it back at sensory...

22:36.040 --> 22:42.680
Oh, it's evolved into a fountain pen in my mind, because of its deep significance.

22:43.160 --> 22:46.920
The ballpoint pen would just mean you have a hole in your pocket.

22:49.640 --> 22:54.040
It fell out of an astronaut's pocket. It's a likely explanation.

22:55.320 --> 23:01.400
For you, David, an example of an emergent law that constrains also the microscopic laws would be

23:01.400 --> 23:03.720
there exist universal computers. Yes.

23:05.160 --> 23:09.400
Okay. Would you like maybe to expand a bit more, because you've contributed quite significantly

23:09.480 --> 23:14.440
to the church-turing thesis. I think there was quite a bit of ambiguity of how we should

23:14.440 --> 23:19.400
understand the church-turing thesis, and now you name the physicality of the universal computer.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.320
I right away see a link. Maybe it would be good to expand a little bit on that, especially for

23:23.320 --> 23:31.960
the audience here. Okay. Well, this is controversial, and I don't think I did. I think it was Turing.

23:32.760 --> 23:43.800
So the way the story is usually told is that Turing, Girdle, Church, and Post all came up

23:43.800 --> 23:49.240
with the same idea at the same time, all proved the same theorems, basically, although they had

23:49.240 --> 23:56.680
different points of view. None of them copied from each other. Although some of them knew about

23:56.680 --> 24:05.000
each other, but they kind of converged on a conception. But I think Turing's conception was

24:05.000 --> 24:16.120
different. The other three all had the mathematician's misconception. They all thought that they were

24:16.120 --> 24:25.000
doing a piece of mathematics, or as Roger Penrose would say, meta-mathematics, theory of proofs.

24:25.080 --> 24:36.840
But Turing, the way he solved the Hilbert's decision problem, was to think of a physical

24:36.840 --> 24:45.640
model of proof, a physical model, and then argue implicitly, explicitly, that again,

24:45.640 --> 24:59.240
is controversial, that that argument is decisive. That is, he thought he was proving,

24:59.240 --> 25:15.560
and he almost did prove, that no physical object can escape being part of the Turing

25:15.720 --> 25:22.360
universal Turing machine's repertoire. The universal Turing machine is an idealized

25:22.360 --> 25:32.120
physical machine. It's really got nothing to do with mathematics. Its physical relationship

25:32.120 --> 25:38.760
with the rest of the universe is what he elucidated. Then he said that that solves the

25:38.760 --> 25:44.440
decision problem, because we must regard the decision problem itself as a question about

25:44.440 --> 25:51.800
the physical world, including mathematicians and so on. That's why he used language like

25:52.840 --> 25:59.560
functions that would naturally be regarded as computable. Naturally, I always took that to mean

26:00.600 --> 26:06.280
straightforwardly, computable in nature. But when I said that to mathematicians,

26:06.280 --> 26:11.560
they howled in rage and said that I'd misunderstood it. Well, if I'd been

26:11.560 --> 26:18.040
misunderstood it, that misunderstanding turns out to be the truth, and Turing's writings look

26:18.040 --> 26:26.920
exactly like that truth. I think he knew. He just wasn't used to talking about physics.

26:26.920 --> 26:32.760
He was a mathematician, but I think he did not have the mathematician's misconception.

26:34.440 --> 26:38.760
We're all brought up to have it. We have to free ourselves.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.800
How would you say, what is the mathematician's misconception?

26:43.240 --> 26:51.400
Well, it's the idea that, well, okay, for present company, I can put it like this.

26:54.040 --> 27:01.160
It's the idea that the integers and the logical operations like and or and not

27:02.120 --> 27:10.120
are given to us by God. They are the natural things. If you can build some structure or

27:10.120 --> 27:17.800
form some conclusion on top of those, then you have proved it. Whereas the real truth is that

27:17.800 --> 27:26.520
the integers and the logical connectives and classical rules of inference and all that,

27:26.520 --> 27:37.880
they are all given to us by physics alone. There is no underlying mathematical substrate

27:37.880 --> 27:44.920
that we can appeal to. If the laws of physics were different, then we could have laws of physics

27:44.920 --> 27:54.680
that didn't mention and or and not or integers or real numbers or they could use any mathematical

27:54.680 --> 28:00.920
objects anywhere in the mathematical world. But the fact that they don't is a feature of the laws

28:00.920 --> 28:13.560
of physics. With this, with this misconception comes some other misconceptions such as, for example,

28:13.560 --> 28:19.800
that simplicity is somehow defined independently of the laws of physics.

28:20.440 --> 28:29.400
And infinity as well, as I have written, you know, Zeno was puzzled by the fact that there's

28:29.400 --> 28:35.480
an infinite number of points between here and the other side of the room. And how come that he can

28:36.600 --> 28:42.840
go from one point to another and how come he can do an infinite number of things in a finite time?

28:42.920 --> 28:50.840
Well, the answer is that what is finite or infinite physically, its relationship to

28:50.840 --> 28:56.440
mathematical finiteness or infinite is a matter for the laws of physics to determine. And they

28:56.440 --> 29:03.800
happen to say that this particular infinite thing in classical physics, the continuum,

29:04.680 --> 29:11.960
can be traversed, an infinite number of steps of traversing it can be finitely performed.

29:12.680 --> 29:19.880
So what can be finitely performed or not or and what conversely what can only be infinitely

29:19.880 --> 29:27.400
performed, i.e. can't be performed, is mandated by the laws of physics, not vice versa. So it's

29:27.400 --> 29:34.120
physics that tells us the difference between find an infinite, complex and simple,

29:35.080 --> 29:42.680
and also probability, which is a sort of scam lodged in the middle of all these misconceptions.

29:46.040 --> 29:52.920
The idea that it's a meta misconception, a meta misconception, it's a what, sorry?

29:53.800 --> 30:00.360
Meta misconception. Well, no, no, it's a good place to hide a scam.

30:00.920 --> 30:07.320
Of the matter. There is simply a misconception that probability is another one of these concepts

30:07.320 --> 30:14.600
that we can help ourselves to and we haven't yet invoked any physics. We would like what we see

30:14.600 --> 30:24.520
to have at least 0.83 probability, then we won't worry that it's strange. And that invocation

30:24.520 --> 30:32.840
of probability we take to be sort of harmless. We don't see that there's a rich world of physics

30:32.840 --> 30:38.520
defining what we mean by that. And in the case of probability, unlike the other things,

30:39.080 --> 30:46.600
it doesn't even apply to most of the universe or the multiverse. It just applies to very

30:46.680 --> 30:56.280
special situations. So there's no excuse for it. Let me just ask a little bit, a clarification,

30:56.280 --> 31:00.840
David. If I would have been asked what's the mathematician misconception, in a nutshell,

31:00.840 --> 31:07.640
I would have said it's the idea that proof theory is a branch of mathematics. But proof theory is

31:07.640 --> 31:14.440
a branch of physics, ultimately. It's given rise to computer science. Computer science has its

31:14.440 --> 31:20.680
roots into what our computers are physical objects. Now, the story you just gave us,

31:20.680 --> 31:26.520
you started speaking of natural numbers and logical connectors. How can I bridge those two

31:27.480 --> 31:34.760
pictures of the mathematician misconception? Well, they are the same, I think.

31:36.520 --> 31:43.720
Maybe I'm giving a try and then tell me. Because we typically do proofs with

31:43.720 --> 31:49.240
typical logical connectors and that will give rise to somehow our computers so that we end up

31:49.240 --> 31:54.200
abstracting our computers with those logical connectors and those integers. And that's where

31:54.200 --> 32:01.960
you say that taking this as a way to formalize proof is basically physical because I'm already

32:01.960 --> 32:11.240
abstracting my physics of the computation. Yes. I think that's basically what I said.

32:14.600 --> 32:21.480
I'm not really used to speaking in mathematical language. So I speak of it in terms of laws of

32:21.480 --> 32:26.360
physics. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Now, I was trying to map this, the statement proof theory is a

32:26.360 --> 32:33.000
branch of physics. Yeah. So I think probably Turing never said this, but I'm sure if he was here

32:33.080 --> 32:43.320
now, he would agree that proof theory is a branch of physics. Yeah. Okay. I have,

32:44.760 --> 32:49.160
I found myself agreeing with almost everything you said until you started talking about the

32:49.160 --> 32:54.760
mathematical mathematician's misconception, which I don't think Turing would have agreed with you

32:54.760 --> 33:10.280
about, and which I think is actually a piece of professionalism. It's an idea that you don't like,

33:11.400 --> 33:15.800
but you haven't shown that there's anything false about it. In fact, I think Turing

33:16.120 --> 33:27.240
thought more about physics than his contemporaries. But I think he felt that this, the discovery of

33:27.240 --> 33:38.680
universality meant that the physics of that we have here could be simulated by a computer.

33:39.480 --> 33:46.120
And the physics that might exist in a very different world, perhaps one with a different

33:46.120 --> 33:53.400
number of dimensions or one that's not even has a notion of locality, could also be simulated

33:53.400 --> 34:01.160
by a Turing machine. In other words, I believe he felt the, he was very aware of physics and he,

34:01.160 --> 34:09.240
but he didn't think that different, different parts of the multiverse with, think of the string

34:09.240 --> 34:15.320
theory, the vast number of different supposed things that can come out of string theory,

34:15.320 --> 34:21.400
of which we might be one, that they would have a different mathematics. He think he would,

34:21.400 --> 34:27.240
I think he believed in the universality of mathematics and its ability to simulate physics.

34:27.240 --> 34:33.560
So that's where I think that you're even calling it a misconception, is a misconception of what

34:33.560 --> 34:40.520
Turing thought and also a, a, a disphemism rather than any kind of refutation. However,

34:40.520 --> 34:45.400
almost everything you said at the beginning, I agreed with, I said, I take for granted that,

34:45.400 --> 34:49.640
that, that universality of computation, the unsolvability of the problem, which is the same

34:49.640 --> 34:59.560
thing, is the, the, the heart of, of what, what the notion of computation is. And that the,

35:00.280 --> 35:05.960
the other thing is that, that I also didn't even say because I, I believe it so strongly,

35:05.960 --> 35:12.760
is that this, this mathematics, this universal mathematics of, of computation is,

35:13.000 --> 35:21.000
is capable of, of simulating physics, not only the physics that we have here,

35:21.560 --> 35:28.440
but if you talk to Andreas, if he's still around here, there he is. Yes. In, in many models of

35:28.440 --> 35:35.560
cosmology, now imagine that there are, that there are inaccessible parts of the universe,

35:35.560 --> 35:40.120
which are no, no less real than ours, except that we'll never hear about them,

35:40.680 --> 35:44.840
in which the laws of physics, such as the number of spatial dimensions and the number of temporal

35:44.840 --> 35:53.560
dimensions, if you want, and, and, and are extremely different. And in, in almost all of them,

35:53.560 --> 35:58.680
universal computers don't exist. They exist physically, but they don't exist. There's nobody

35:58.680 --> 36:04.680
there to complain about it or to celebrate it. But they're there. They're like the, the desert

36:04.680 --> 36:11.160
areas of, of, of, of the universe. But all of that could be simulated by mathematics. So I don't

36:11.160 --> 36:15.240
think there's a, I don't think there's, I don't think there is a mathematician's misconception.

36:15.240 --> 36:23.400
There's just the, the idea, which has been around since, since, since Galileo, that, that

36:24.120 --> 36:32.040
whatever physics is, is discoverable by experiment and in a model level by, by mathematics.

36:32.040 --> 36:40.280
I think that's clearly untrue. If by universe you mean

36:42.120 --> 36:48.760
the set of all, or potentially the set of all possible mathematical entities

36:48.760 --> 36:53.400
instantiated as physical objects, as you say, most of those would not be

36:54.520 --> 37:00.680
simulatable by a Turing machine. No, no, I, no, they all would be simulatable by a Turing machine.

37:00.680 --> 37:06.520
Most of them wouldn't give rise to the physical possibility of Turing machine in that part of

37:06.520 --> 37:10.680
the universe. For example, I don't think there are a lot of Turing machines in the middle of the sun.

37:12.440 --> 37:20.200
But in the space of all mathematical objects, there are objects which solve the halting problem.

37:21.800 --> 37:27.480
And that such an object cannot be simulated by a Turing machine. It can, it might, there are,

37:27.480 --> 37:33.720
there are also kind of universes where. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I have, yeah. This is in other words,

37:33.720 --> 37:42.600
these, these, like the, the, clean the hierarchy of all of these higher level of unsolvable problems,

37:42.600 --> 37:46.920
what, what you, the problems that you can solve if you had an oracle for the holding problem.

37:48.680 --> 37:51.800
Now, I have an idea that I'd like to run by

37:52.120 --> 37:59.720
mathematicians, such as yourself, even these mathematicians, which just as I have been lately,

37:59.720 --> 38:05.480
over the last five years, seduced by cosmology. And so think, oh, it must have the answers to all

38:05.480 --> 38:11.080
the things I worried about since I was five. Let me try to understand it better. So, you know,

38:11.080 --> 38:17.160
you're a mathematician and you said, you've gotten to be so fascinated with physics. All the answers

38:17.160 --> 38:20.920
to all the things I'm wondering about in mathematics must be in physics somewhere. Let me learn some

38:21.480 --> 38:27.880
physics. Well, anyway, this is an idea that you probably know more about as a mathematician.

38:27.880 --> 38:38.280
But when I was writing about the, the, the, the, Chaton's omega number, the holding probability

38:38.280 --> 38:43.080
of a universal computer with self-delimiting programs, where if you had this number, you would,

38:43.080 --> 38:50.520
you would have an oracle for the holding problem, but it would be at a painfully slow oracle that

38:50.520 --> 38:52.440
In other words, in order to answer any question,

38:52.440 --> 38:55.840
you would have to run for a busy beaver amount of time.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.400
And I said, well, this Oracle would

38:58.400 --> 39:03.720
be universal in the sense that it would

39:03.720 --> 39:08.240
decide all finitely refutable propositions.

39:08.240 --> 39:12.840
In other words, problems such that you

39:12.840 --> 39:16.280
can express them with one quantifier

39:16.280 --> 39:18.000
over the natural numbers.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.800
In other words, there exists a time

39:20.800 --> 39:24.000
such that if you run this Turing machine for this amount

39:24.000 --> 39:26.840
of time, it halts.

39:26.840 --> 39:34.640
And then I speculated that the harder problems,

39:34.640 --> 39:36.680
which would involve two quantifiers or more

39:36.680 --> 39:42.720
like the twin prime conjecture, might be, by and large,

39:42.720 --> 39:46.400
not interesting because not mathematically interesting

39:46.400 --> 39:58.760
because they could be decided by a stronger but finitely

39:58.760 --> 40:00.560
refutable proposition.

40:00.560 --> 40:03.400
In other words, instead of saying there are infinitely

40:03.400 --> 40:11.560
many twin primes, you could say that the spacing between twin

40:11.560 --> 40:19.400
primes grows more rapidly or more slowly

40:19.400 --> 40:20.440
than a certain function.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.880
So in other words, one of the quantifiers,

40:22.880 --> 40:24.800
something that has more than one quantifier,

40:24.800 --> 40:30.520
might turn out to be a consequence of something

40:30.520 --> 40:32.080
that has only one quantifier.

40:32.080 --> 40:35.840
So what you're feeling about when you say natural

40:35.840 --> 40:39.920
in mathematics, maybe these things that

40:39.960 --> 40:44.840
are harder than the halting problem are just kind of boring

40:44.840 --> 40:47.440
because probably most of them would be, what do I mean?

40:47.440 --> 40:50.920
By probably, I'm invoking your scam of probability.

40:50.920 --> 40:53.360
Probably most of them would be decided

40:53.360 --> 40:55.040
as cases of the halting problem.

40:58.960 --> 41:00.800
I was sure for most of what you've just said

41:00.800 --> 41:02.000
that you were addressing, Charles,

41:02.000 --> 41:04.600
because I'm certainly not a mathematician.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.040
Them's fighting words, you know.

41:07.040 --> 41:08.560
Oh, OK, OK.

41:09.120 --> 41:13.040
If you have an idea, if you have a tentative answer,

41:13.040 --> 41:13.840
David, go for it.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.680
But I also thought about it.

41:15.680 --> 41:16.280
I know exactly.

41:16.280 --> 41:16.800
Go ahead.

41:16.800 --> 41:17.280
No, no.

41:17.280 --> 41:18.000
Yeah, OK.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.840
I'm sorry, I almost said that at the point.

41:19.840 --> 41:22.960
I think that your case, I remember that piece, Charlie,

41:22.960 --> 41:27.080
you wrote, in which you say that you specifically

41:27.080 --> 41:29.520
spoke about the twin prime conjecture.

41:29.520 --> 41:32.280
But was that naturally carried over

41:32.280 --> 41:37.000
to higher elements of the arithmetic hierarchy?

41:37.040 --> 41:39.280
I think so, because if you're saying,

41:39.280 --> 41:43.520
if you bound these quantifiers, you can make them go away.

41:43.520 --> 41:45.720
And if a bound exists, it could be

41:45.720 --> 41:50.480
that there's a proposition that decides the twin prime conjecture

41:50.480 --> 41:53.800
by proving a stronger conjecture that is just

41:53.800 --> 41:56.760
of the same form as a halting problem.

41:56.760 --> 41:57.560
Yeah.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.840
And if you had three or four quantifiers,

41:59.840 --> 42:01.880
it could same thing, I believe the same thing could happen.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.080
I didn't think anything.

42:03.080 --> 42:08.800
And what if the, OK, so another sort of possible glitch

42:08.800 --> 42:12.160
that I see is, if the spacing in the twin prime conjecture

42:12.160 --> 42:16.760
scales, suppose, larger than busy beaver,

42:16.760 --> 42:18.960
then no algorithm can base it.

42:18.960 --> 42:20.160
Oh, yeah, yeah, it could.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.760
Yeah, so that's exactly it.

42:22.760 --> 42:27.120
In other words, if you say, irrefutable.

42:27.120 --> 42:31.920
Yeah, certain things of that sort could exist.

42:31.920 --> 42:36.120
So I guess this is like experimental mathematics,

42:36.120 --> 42:38.200
except you can't do the experiments.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.160
But it just occurred to me.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.960
I don't know, has anybody thought about that?

42:41.960 --> 42:44.000
How do you decide how plausible it

42:44.000 --> 42:52.080
is that one of these higher level conjectures

42:52.080 --> 42:55.760
could be decided by a provable.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.040
Oh, yes, it's really a futile gesture,

42:58.040 --> 43:00.920
because it's like, if I had a solution to the halting problem,

43:00.920 --> 43:03.480
then maybe I could solve the twin prime conjecture

43:03.480 --> 43:05.480
without doing any extra work.

43:05.480 --> 43:07.720
But that's like, if my aunt had wheels,

43:07.720 --> 43:09.520
she'd be a trolley car, because I don't

43:09.520 --> 43:11.240
have a solution to the halting problem.

43:11.240 --> 43:12.840
Yeah, but it might also be that you

43:12.840 --> 43:15.560
have a solution to the halting problem, and you still can.

43:15.560 --> 43:17.000
And you still couldn't, yes.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.360
So how do you compare the likelihood of those two things?

43:20.360 --> 43:21.920
And I'm sure something's thought about.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.120
And what we mean by likelihood, but yeah.

43:23.120 --> 43:25.040
Yeah, shut up.

43:25.040 --> 43:28.760
But actually, basically, perhaps we

43:28.760 --> 43:30.480
could move on on the topic of incompleteness.

43:30.480 --> 43:31.760
And I think you bring it on.

43:31.760 --> 43:36.000
I had a bit of a context, maybe, to get people into it.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.720
But the incompleteness of mathematics

43:39.720 --> 43:43.440
was perhaps we have to start it back to Hilbert, where

43:43.440 --> 43:46.880
he was hoping to put into a single formal leximistic

43:46.880 --> 43:50.600
theory all of mathematical truths.

43:50.600 --> 43:56.000
And Girdel in 1931 basically put an end to this hope

43:56.000 --> 43:59.720
by finding a statement that is true and has no proof.

43:59.760 --> 44:02.360
But Girdel's statement is self-referential,

44:02.360 --> 44:06.960
and it might look like an exotic kind of statements.

44:06.960 --> 44:09.160
So it's tempting to think that these kind of statements

44:09.160 --> 44:11.480
are an anomaly, and that we can safely ignore them

44:11.480 --> 44:13.160
and keep doing proofs and mathematics

44:13.160 --> 44:16.680
like we usually would have before Girdel's result.

44:16.680 --> 44:19.400
And I assume most mathematicians live their life this way,

44:19.400 --> 44:21.000
and I don't blame them.

44:21.000 --> 44:24.880
But seen from an algorithmic information theory perspective,

44:24.880 --> 44:27.880
notably due to the work of Gregory Chaitan,

44:27.920 --> 44:31.720
one of your former colleagues, I believe, Charlie,

44:31.720 --> 44:36.040
incompleteness is a much more widespread and inevitable

44:36.040 --> 44:37.560
phenomenon.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.960
So for one thing, Chaitan's result of incompleteness

44:39.960 --> 44:42.920
does not involve self-referential statements.

44:42.920 --> 44:45.200
And also, they're usually cast in a way

44:45.200 --> 44:47.720
that he comes up with an infinite family of true

44:47.720 --> 44:50.200
but unprovable statements.

44:50.200 --> 44:53.480
And then he say, oh, I will enlarge my formal leximistic

44:53.480 --> 44:56.360
theory to be able to prove more of those statements.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.800
But by doing so, you only manage to prove finitely more.

44:59.800 --> 45:01.560
But you're still in front, regardless

45:01.560 --> 45:03.880
how big your formal leximistic theory grows,

45:03.880 --> 45:07.400
you're always in front of an infinity of true yet

45:07.400 --> 45:09.280
unprovable statements.

45:09.280 --> 45:12.480
These are generally the ideas from the algorithmic information

45:12.480 --> 45:15.560
theoretic proofs of incompleteness.

45:15.560 --> 45:19.080
So yeah, I think algorithmic information theory

45:19.080 --> 45:22.360
makes the case for somewhat natural.

45:22.360 --> 45:24.560
Incompleteness becomes somewhat natural and actually

45:24.560 --> 45:26.080
inevitable.

45:26.080 --> 45:29.360
Charlie, would you like to react or comment or expand

45:29.360 --> 45:33.360
on the limits of our formal leximistic theories?

45:33.360 --> 45:37.680
Notably, I have in mind maybe some

45:37.680 --> 45:39.880
of how we should behave with respect

45:39.880 --> 45:42.360
to formal leximistic theories in the light

45:42.360 --> 45:44.840
of these incompleteness theorems.

45:44.840 --> 45:48.400
Chaitan has suggested maybe we should acquire new axioms based

45:48.400 --> 45:51.240
on their fertility of the consequences,

45:51.240 --> 45:54.040
the problems that they help us solving.

45:54.040 --> 45:56.080
To me, there's a striking similarity now

45:56.080 --> 45:58.440
between what theoretical physicists do,

45:58.440 --> 46:02.280
where they change or update their principles

46:02.280 --> 46:04.640
based on the problems that we're care to solve.

46:04.640 --> 46:07.760
So do you have any remarks to make on that line

46:07.760 --> 46:09.520
of philosophy of incompleteness?

46:14.720 --> 46:16.560
Well, I'm more of a physicist.

46:16.560 --> 46:23.720
So those are the things that I suggested,

46:23.720 --> 46:28.040
which is maybe, I really love computational universality.

46:28.040 --> 46:32.800
And the, I couldn't live, this reminds me

46:32.800 --> 46:45.200
of what Danny Greenberger said about quantum mechanics.

46:45.200 --> 46:50.200
He said, in any god that would know

46:50.200 --> 46:52.480
which slit the particle went through,

46:52.520 --> 46:58.080
I wouldn't believe in that god of the two slit experiments.

46:58.080 --> 47:05.280
So I would say anyone who would like to live in a world

47:05.280 --> 47:10.200
that Hilbert wanted to find, I wouldn't want to be friends

47:10.200 --> 47:13.280
with that person.

47:13.280 --> 47:19.000
In other words, I think that the universality and the dual

47:19.000 --> 47:23.840
side to it is the incompleteness is just the way,

47:23.840 --> 47:26.040
a beautiful feature of the way world is.

47:26.040 --> 47:28.120
It's beautiful in mathematics in the same way

47:28.120 --> 47:34.320
that quantum mechanics is beautiful in physics

47:34.320 --> 47:36.680
or general relativity.

47:36.680 --> 47:37.120
Nice.

47:37.120 --> 47:37.480
Thanks.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.840
David, what is your take on incompleteness?

47:39.840 --> 47:42.080
And it doesn't have to be from the algorithmic information

47:42.080 --> 47:42.960
theoretic perspective.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.840
Just what are your thoughts?

47:45.840 --> 47:47.880
I would agree with what Charlie just said.

47:48.120 --> 47:53.320
It's the world that Hilbert envisaged

47:53.320 --> 47:55.800
is a world without creativity.

47:55.800 --> 48:00.720
And probably ultimately, if you take our world

48:00.720 --> 48:04.440
and hobble it down to that level,

48:04.440 --> 48:06.560
life could never have evolved.

48:06.560 --> 48:11.400
So ours is a world in which life can evolve

48:11.400 --> 48:16.960
because there's incompleteness in the mathematics

48:16.960 --> 48:19.400
that describe our world.

48:19.400 --> 48:25.040
I said mathematics just now as a concession to you all.

48:25.040 --> 48:30.000
But what I meant is entirely a physical thing.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.280
It's a physical property of the world,

48:33.280 --> 48:39.320
which is responsible for the possibility of life

48:39.320 --> 48:45.120
and then later, presumably, of intelligence and creativity.

48:45.120 --> 48:56.760
And science and of the limitlessness of science.

48:56.760 --> 49:02.520
So the illimitability of science is itself,

49:02.520 --> 49:04.560
let's put it the other way around.

49:04.560 --> 49:09.080
If science was limited, if there was a feature of the universe

49:09.080 --> 49:12.960
that limits science in the way that Hilbert wanted

49:12.960 --> 49:15.520
to limit mathematics, then there couldn't

49:15.520 --> 49:18.120
have been any science in the first place.

49:18.120 --> 49:22.720
And this is another one of those connections

49:22.720 --> 49:26.000
between what we call emergent properties

49:26.000 --> 49:29.200
and what we call microscopic properties.

49:29.200 --> 49:36.240
I would like to see a way of formulating the laws of physics

49:36.240 --> 49:40.880
that doesn't discriminate between microscopic and emergent

49:40.880 --> 49:42.200
laws of physics.

49:42.240 --> 49:47.120
A lot of the notorious problems we have,

49:47.120 --> 49:52.320
like how to define entropy and the arrow of time and so on,

49:52.320 --> 49:58.640
I think are just because we insist that the world must

49:58.640 --> 50:01.040
be fundamentally made of microscopic laws.

50:05.720 --> 50:08.840
So just to let you all know, constructor theory

50:08.840 --> 50:15.720
is an attempt to have a scale independent way

50:15.720 --> 50:19.120
of describing laws.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.920
I think someone's raised a hand, is that?

50:21.920 --> 50:23.920
OK.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.400
So you said that if there was anything

50:26.400 --> 50:30.880
that limited science in the universe, if science was somehow,

50:30.880 --> 50:33.920
if the universe somehow limited the scope of science,

50:33.920 --> 50:39.320
then science couldn't have gone the start in the first place.

50:39.320 --> 50:43.920
But I can imagine that the observable universe is actually

50:43.920 --> 50:44.600
all there is.

50:44.600 --> 50:46.800
Beyond the observable universe, there's no matter.

50:46.800 --> 50:48.840
There's only space.

50:48.840 --> 50:51.600
So there's nothing to help us, I know,

50:51.600 --> 50:53.800
form larger and larger computations.

50:53.800 --> 50:55.160
So at some point, we reach the limit

50:55.160 --> 50:58.760
of what we can do with computers or something like that.

50:58.760 --> 51:02.760
And that would still be consistent with us having

51:02.800 --> 51:05.440
to do science right now.

51:05.440 --> 51:09.840
And I was wondering if you think it's wrong that maybe,

51:09.840 --> 51:13.200
even if there's a world without, even beyond the observable

51:13.200 --> 51:16.680
universe, there's no matter, that you can somehow still

51:16.680 --> 51:19.800
have science that progresses infinitely,

51:19.800 --> 51:22.480
or if there's another mistake, or I'm

51:22.480 --> 51:24.000
curious about the response to that.

51:24.000 --> 51:24.800
Yeah.

51:24.800 --> 51:26.280
So I think that is wrong.

51:26.280 --> 51:31.400
And it's for exactly the same reason that I was just saying.

51:31.800 --> 51:37.160
If we characterize all possible laws

51:37.160 --> 51:43.120
as being like our world, but it only lasts a million years,

51:43.120 --> 51:45.320
or like our world, but it only lasts a billion years,

51:45.320 --> 51:48.360
or then there are lots of possibilities

51:48.360 --> 51:57.360
where it would look like our world was the actual one.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.720
And similarly for mathematics, you

51:59.720 --> 52:04.040
could have, it might be possible for proofs

52:04.040 --> 52:08.600
to reach up to a million steps, but no more,

52:08.600 --> 52:11.000
because it's so happened that the laws of physics

52:11.000 --> 52:14.320
make all computers decay after they have performed

52:14.320 --> 52:15.640
a million steps.

52:15.640 --> 52:22.160
And there are many more of those worlds

52:22.160 --> 52:25.560
than there are what we think the actual world is,

52:25.560 --> 52:27.360
with no limits.

52:27.400 --> 52:33.440
And that is because that's an illustration of the fact

52:33.440 --> 52:38.440
that it's OK.

52:38.440 --> 52:44.000
I won't say it's because the limitless one is simpler,

52:44.000 --> 52:46.600
because that would be falling into the mathematician's

52:46.600 --> 52:48.280
misconception.

52:48.280 --> 52:50.760
But I want to say something like that.

52:50.800 --> 53:01.200
I want to say that the limitless one is a good explanation

53:01.200 --> 53:04.920
in high-level terms.

53:04.920 --> 53:08.360
If you try to translate that into low-level terms,

53:08.360 --> 53:11.520
you'll get to variations of it, which look like, well,

53:11.520 --> 53:12.800
it only lasts a million years.

53:12.800 --> 53:15.160
It only lasts two million years, and so on.

53:15.160 --> 53:19.960
But at the high level, variations of it

53:20.000 --> 53:25.440
are very difficult to find, because you would have to say,

53:25.440 --> 53:31.400
OK, proof is limited by what?

53:31.400 --> 53:33.920
You would have to have some high-level thing that

53:33.920 --> 53:39.120
can fit into the language of talking about proofs

53:39.120 --> 53:45.720
and limits and completeness, and so on.

53:45.720 --> 53:47.400
So from the point of view of physics,

53:47.400 --> 53:52.240
these are all high-level macroscopic constructs.

53:55.080 --> 54:00.600
But I think those are the fundamental concepts in which

54:00.600 --> 54:04.600
the laws of physics actually are expressed.

54:04.600 --> 54:10.200
And because of that, we can say that insisting

54:10.200 --> 54:16.040
on describing it all microscopically is perverse,

54:16.040 --> 54:18.600
because it's much less simple.

54:18.600 --> 54:22.000
But what we really mean is that there

54:22.000 --> 54:24.880
are no good explanations along that route.

54:27.320 --> 54:28.280
Very good words.

54:28.280 --> 54:29.400
Can I summarize?

54:29.400 --> 54:31.000
How are we going to speak?

54:31.000 --> 54:33.520
The way I understand what you just said

54:33.520 --> 54:35.680
is that there's other explanation of,

54:35.680 --> 54:39.080
might well be that in some sense, it

54:39.080 --> 54:42.280
could be that the universe ends above the observable,

54:42.280 --> 54:43.840
that the observable universe is all there is,

54:43.840 --> 54:45.480
but that would ruin other explanations

54:45.480 --> 54:48.120
that can have, like, face dimensions of how science works.

54:48.120 --> 54:48.600
Yes.

54:48.600 --> 54:49.100
Yeah.

54:49.100 --> 54:50.480
And if you're going to settle for that,

54:50.480 --> 54:52.240
you might as well settle for the fairies

54:52.240 --> 54:53.680
at the bottom of the garden.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.200
We needn't have embarked on this great project

54:56.200 --> 54:59.040
of mathematics and physics.

54:59.040 --> 54:59.540
Yes.

55:03.120 --> 55:05.200
Thanks.

55:05.200 --> 55:08.560
David, would you relate the incompleteness phenomenon

55:08.560 --> 55:11.440
in mathematics with fallibilism in knowledge creation

55:11.440 --> 55:13.200
in general?

55:13.200 --> 55:15.120
It seems like you sort of invoked it

55:15.160 --> 55:16.560
when you invoked life.

55:16.560 --> 55:19.400
Is that the similar idea?

55:19.400 --> 55:22.320
Yes, it's, again, a similar idea and for the same reason,

55:22.320 --> 55:30.880
that if fallibilism were not true

55:30.880 --> 55:35.120
and there were infallible ways of deriving knowledge,

55:35.120 --> 55:38.600
then when we have derived some knowledge,

55:38.600 --> 55:40.680
it would never change.

55:40.680 --> 55:42.400
And it would be true.

55:42.400 --> 55:44.760
And the world would be finite, the world

55:44.760 --> 55:49.000
would be a representation of that finite piece of knowledge.

55:49.000 --> 55:53.760
And conversely, the real situation

55:53.760 --> 55:59.280
is that the world is infinitely amenable to knowledge

55:59.280 --> 56:06.080
creation, and therefore, it must be infinitely

56:06.080 --> 56:09.960
susceptible to errors, which, however, can be corrected.

56:09.960 --> 56:16.720
But nothing provides a firm foundation.

56:16.720 --> 56:19.760
Not even, and I repeat what I said earlier,

56:19.760 --> 56:24.120
not even logic, not even the logical rules of inference,

56:24.120 --> 56:27.160
those are all conjectures.

56:27.160 --> 56:29.440
We pick them because they seem right,

56:29.440 --> 56:32.320
because they seem useful, they seem fruitful.

56:32.320 --> 56:34.560
But who knows?

56:34.560 --> 56:37.880
We may find new ones.

56:38.440 --> 56:47.160
Are you saying that there could be a world in which pi was rational,

56:47.160 --> 56:48.960
or a square root of 2, say?

56:48.960 --> 56:54.000
Well, of course, that's a fairly simple case.

56:54.000 --> 56:57.720
All it would have to do is have a different geometry from ours,

56:57.720 --> 56:59.240
not Euclidean geometry.

56:59.240 --> 57:06.080
I mean, pi isn't instantiated in the universe anyway.

57:06.080 --> 57:09.040
It's an idealization.

57:09.040 --> 57:11.120
So if you actually measure a circle,

57:11.120 --> 57:15.560
you'll never get pi as the ratio between the radius

57:15.560 --> 57:21.040
and the diameter and the circumference.

57:21.040 --> 57:24.560
I was thinking of the mathematical pi.

57:24.560 --> 57:27.880
Well, there are two different things

57:27.880 --> 57:31.160
one might mean by the mathematical pi.

57:31.160 --> 57:33.760
Physics allows us a certain window

57:33.760 --> 57:37.000
onto the class of abstractions, a tiny window.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.280
We can see some of them, we can form theories about some of them,

57:40.280 --> 57:41.400
we can learn about some of them,

57:41.400 --> 57:46.120
and they include Euclidean geometry with its pi.

57:46.120 --> 57:51.720
That pi cannot be changed by anyone, not even God,

57:51.720 --> 57:54.480
not even if we look out of a different window.

57:54.480 --> 57:56.680
But if we did look out of a different window,

57:56.680 --> 57:58.760
thanks to having different laws of physics,

57:58.760 --> 58:01.520
or if the laws of physics were not what we think they are,

58:01.560 --> 58:04.120
but are a bit different from what we think they are,

58:04.120 --> 58:08.960
as happened with Euclidean geometry and general relativity,

58:08.960 --> 58:14.160
then we won't find pi out there in the stuff we can look at.

58:14.160 --> 58:19.480
We can still describe it, we can describe pi,

58:19.480 --> 58:21.880
and we can describe the universe as it actually is,

58:21.880 --> 58:25.320
which doesn't have pi.

58:25.320 --> 58:28.960
And there will be other ones which we can't describe.

58:28.960 --> 58:31.320
We can't describe, but they may have people

58:31.320 --> 58:33.720
in them which can describe them.

58:33.720 --> 58:36.320
And then there'll be infinitely more,

58:36.320 --> 58:38.960
where there aren't people who can describe anything.

58:40.600 --> 58:45.480
And be careful to conclude that therefore we don't exist,

58:45.480 --> 58:50.480
because that is like the anthropic principle misconception.

58:53.080 --> 58:55.280
Just because of misconceptions.

58:57.400 --> 59:00.440
I would say the misapplication of the anthropic principle.

59:00.440 --> 59:01.680
These places exist,

59:01.680 --> 59:04.240
but there's nobody there to complain about it.

59:04.240 --> 59:08.080
No, but you want to use it to deduce something

59:08.080 --> 59:09.640
about the world we do see.

59:11.240 --> 59:15.080
And I don't think the anthropic principle

59:15.080 --> 59:17.320
is powerful enough to do that,

59:17.320 --> 59:20.320
because it will only, the most it can do is put it on the edge.

59:20.320 --> 59:25.320
Yeah, I agree, I want to say something about on the edge,

59:25.880 --> 59:27.680
because you reminded me of that.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.120
And I don't want to show you a picture,

59:29.120 --> 59:30.120
is that okay now?

59:30.120 --> 59:31.600
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

59:31.600 --> 59:35.200
Okay, so I started worrying about this

59:35.200 --> 59:40.200
in terms of the Boltzmann brain problem,

59:41.360 --> 59:43.160
which most of you are familiar with,

59:43.160 --> 59:46.480
but here's a sort of a summary of it.

59:48.800 --> 59:51.720
The New York Times version, from Sean Carroll.

59:51.720 --> 59:53.680
This was Boltzmann's idea that the-

59:53.680 --> 59:55.280
We don't see it Charlie.

59:55.280 --> 59:56.720
Oh, I'll have to stay here.

59:56.720 --> 59:59.080
I see it, I don't see why, okay.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.120
The reason the universe is out of equilibrium is anthropic.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:07.240
That is that if the universe is infinite and at equilibrium,

01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:11.280
but we couldn't exist in one of these typical parts.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.320
So we're in an atypical part, anthropically selected.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:18.560
But then somebody else, I think it was Edicton said,

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:22.160
wait a minute, if that's true, then we probably,

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:25.000
most probably are in the smallest fluctuation

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.040
consistent with our brain existing.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:34.000
And so the idea was that you would get something like this.

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.400
Where do I go to the next screen here?

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.400
Yeah, let's see if we go down here, yes.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:47.280
Yes.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.520
Okay, so people worried about equilibration

01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.000
and were in the 19th century,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.760
they called it the heat death of the universe,

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.880
but they thought it was a different problem

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.240
for the distant future.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:01.800
But Boltzmann or Eddington showed it's a problem in the present,

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:04.120
undermining our ability to make inferences

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:06.880
about conditions in the past or elsewhere,

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:09.080
because the inhabitants of any universe

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.880
that will eventually equilibrate

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.400
would have to make the additional postulate

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:18.080
that they're situated atypically early in its history.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.080
Now that gets into David's very nice pointing out that

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.280
from a Occam's razor point of view,

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.200
a world that is just like our world,

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:32.120
but ends in a second from now

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:34.400
or a million years from now

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.800
has almost as simple a description.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.040
So anyway, the Boltzmann brain problem says

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.240
that if world equilibrates,

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.360
then almost all places that experience

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:48.280
the same phenomena that we have,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.000
these are illusory phenomena

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.240
that don't give grounds for scientific inference.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.400
So now there's, this is a little bit like the doomsday problem,

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:03.400
which you can argue that the world that has civilization in it

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.800
is, has only existed for a very short time

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:13.080
compared to the time available to it.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:15.800
And why is we so atypically early?

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.400
Maybe it's because tech civilization

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.640
is intrinsically unstable, it'll destroy itself.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:27.880
Or maybe there's something that I think David would like

01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:29.400
is perpetual noonless.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.880
That is maybe a billion years from now,

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.520
there will still be people,

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.680
but they will be preoccupied

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.040
that some qualitatively new feature of their existence,

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.200
which they consider very important, is so new.

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:46.560
And they wonder why they are so near the beginning

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.200
of infinity, as David would put it.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.760
So I would like to credit the anthropic principle

01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.200
to Schopenhauer, who really expressed it in the 19th century, 1844,

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.360
before Darwin.

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:08.160
And here he says that the world is on the brink of self-destruction.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.160
And we should expect to find it that way

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:19.680
because of this surface to volume argument

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:22.600
in high-dimensional space that David made.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:25.680
That is that if there are many variables

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.400
and all of them have to be within a certain range

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.920
for the world to be habitable or for it to support life

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.720
or for it to support universal computation,

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.920
then with the highest probability,

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:38.080
we're right near the edge

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:43.080
and only a little, very close to self-destruction.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.080
And this is Schopenhauer's,

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.440
he didn't put it in a mathematical terms, but if you did,

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.520
if he says, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds.

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.640
In fact, we live in very nearly the worst

01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:00.480
of all possible worlds,

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:03.520
because if we imagine goodness of a world

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.840
depending on many parameters here too,

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.040
and we just take everything to lowest order,

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:15.240
and the goodness is a quadratic function

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.880
in the best of all possible worlds is the maximum.

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.520
And then we find that we're very close to the edge,

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:26.120
so we're probably right around the edge here,

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.040
and therefore we should expect the world

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:30.360
to be in the brink of self-destruction

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.800
as it apparently is politically right now.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.040
And so we just have to hope that it survives.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.280
Well, that's my comment that I thought

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:43.640
had to do with what we were talking about.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.440
Yeah, again, I advocate thinking

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:53.440
in terms of high-level fundamental laws rather than insisting.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.880
How do you discover what these high-level fundamental laws

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:59.560
because how do you...

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:01.040
Same, well, we already have...

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.280
Discover them or refute them, yeah.

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:06.800
Yeah, the same way that we discovered low-level ones,

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.480
conjecture, we have a problem

01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:11.760
that we think might be soluble

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:14.800
by postulating a law of nature.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:18.360
And the law of nature seems to answer that problem

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.720
and many other problems.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:22.000
And so if it doesn't,

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.080
then we haven't solved the problem yet.

01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:30.080
And the more it does, the more problems it exposes,

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.720
which we then solve and so on.

01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:36.360
Now, we're doing this at many levels already.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.600
I mean, there are people who have deep theories

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:42.920
about what it takes to win a war

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.400
and what it takes to make a stable society

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:49.940
and what it takes to cure depression and so on.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:54.480
It's just that we have a culture that stigmatizes those

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.160
from the point of view of being fundamental.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.240
So we only expect such knowledge

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:05.560
to extend to our own planet, our own time,

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.480
our own species, if that.

01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:14.320
You know, we don't think of them as being fundamental,

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.040
but some of them, like the law of the existence

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:23.440
of universal computation is,

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.400
and the law of increase of entropy for that matter,

01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:33.480
they are, from a practical point of view,

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:37.320
we do regard them as fundamental,

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.680
like as Eddington or someone said,

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:44.320
you know, if somebody tells you that the first law

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:45.720
of thermodynamics is wrong,

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:49.040
then so much the worst for the theory,

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.680
but if they say the second law is wrong,

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:55.880
then they must retire in deep humiliation and so on.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:07:00.880
So we do actually have confidence in high level laws.

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.280
It's just that we have a culture

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:06.760
that tells us that those can't be fundamental.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.920
We can't kind of infer things about the universe

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.320
and the big bang and the long-term survival of the universe

01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:21.320
and bits of the universe that we can't see.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:25.960
This sort of consideration is, you know,

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.280
it's considered ludicrous to try to talk about that

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.000
from using concepts like knowledge

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.080
and even computation and information and so on.

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:42.880
Information actually is a bit of an exception

01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:46.440
because thanks to the mathematician's misconception,

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:49.640
people are inclined to think that information is fundamental

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.040
and everything might be made of bits.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:56.080
But, yes, so, but-

01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:00.240
So you like bit from it rather than it from bit.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.080
Sorry?

01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.760
You like bit from it rather than-

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.080
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.960
So that's very much Landauer's,

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.920
you probably sympathize with what he said.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.560
About this.

01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.480
Information is physical.

01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.880
Oh, yeah, well, of course, I thought we all did.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.280
I thought that's his great contribution to the world.

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.600
Wheeler put it the other way.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.680
He says physics is informational.

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.360
Yeah, well, that's a misconception.

01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:33.720
That obviously can't be right.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:41.800
It's the same thing as expecting us to be in a simulation

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.200
and the aliens simulating us on a giant computer.

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.600
And for some reason,

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.760
people think that that computer has got to be a Turing machine.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:53.520
That's simply a non sequitur.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:58.520
It's just a parochial forcing of a human concept

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:04.960
onto imaginary superhuman aliens.

01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:10.120
You mean you think it might be a machine

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:12.120
at the higher level of the hierarchy,

01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:13.640
which could solve the holding problem

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.080
and then was worrying about harder things?

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.080
Yes, although calling it higher level, that's from our-

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.360
I mean, in the cleaning hierarchy.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.080
Which is, again, expressed from our point of view.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:32.080
It could just have different fundamental states

01:09:32.320 --> 01:09:34.440
and different fundamental operations.

01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:37.400
So one of its fundamental operations might be

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:41.160
to solve the holding problem.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:46.160
Not very slowly, like you're envisaging, but instantly.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:50.240
So you could ask it questions about Turing machines

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:53.080
and it could answer all such questions instantly.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:56.440
On the other hand, adding two and two

01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:59.840
would have it scratching its head for a million years.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.400
Probably like Warcase, right?

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.960
I haven't read it actually.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.440
Oh, it's full of things like that,

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:13.000
about a guy who remembers everything

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
and is paralyzed by that and about-

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.880
Oh, right.

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:27.800
Well, you can't deny that in the set

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:31.160
of all mathematical objects, such things exist.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.720
And therefore it is logically possible

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:38.320
that physics conforms to that object

01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.720
rather than the objects we think it conforms to.

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.720
Okay, I admit that.

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.600
I think I'm going to just disagree with you

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.840
in a way that we can't prove very easily

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.600
because Turing is dead,

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:57.600
that he would have sympathized more with my view

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:01.280
that all the different parts of physics,

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.480
including the parts of the universe we can't get to

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.920
because they're beyond the Hubble distance,

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.360
would be simulable by a Turing machine

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.680
and wouldn't involve these higher-level things.

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.120
But seriously, physicists like, remember Hartle,

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:18.680
Garrach and Hartle wrote a paper

01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.920
about what would an uncomputable number look like

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.080
if it was a physical constant?

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.120
And I think that's certainly a legitimate question.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:29.880
And you're saying that those things,

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.400
that one aspect of the mathematician's disphemism

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.400
is that they assume that such things don't exist.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.840
Yes, yes, when applied to physics, yes.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.880
And I think David was also invoking

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.440
not just beyond the Hubble distance,

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:58.120
but also in a completely different universe.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:00.520
Yeah, well, that's what string theory gives us

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:02.160
as far as I understand, Andreas,

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.480
that there are things where,

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:07.480
I guess it's consistent with quantum field theory

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.760
and general relativity,

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.880
but things that are just extremely different

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:14.280
from anything that we easily imagine.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.800
Yeah, you don't even need string theory.

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.800
I would say the development of theoretical physics

01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:24.760
keeps pulling us in that direction.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.400
And it's hard to truncate.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:31.160
I don't know if it's, you know, right,

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:34.720
but the flavor of theoretical physics,

01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.800
yeah, even uncomputable things could be there.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.240
I don't think that way.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:42.760
So I don't know how to answer that,

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.760
but I think one of the fascinating things

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.440
about cosmology is that

01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:52.880
physicists pride ourselves in this culture

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.200
of we only talk about real stuff we can touch and measure,

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.240
but cosmology really disrupts that.

01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.200
It's really hard to write down theories

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.760
with the tools we have

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:11.040
that allow us to limit ourselves that way.

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.840
And I'm actually really intrigued by David's angle,

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.200
which seems to be to take that

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.360
as a judgment of our ideas about physical laws,

01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:26.600
if I understand that, which I find fascinating.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:31.040
I've come at a lot of these ideas

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:35.320
from the point of view that physics

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.080
has nothing to do with infinity,

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.760
because you'll only ever collect finite data

01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:42.960
and you'll only ever shape

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:48.920
the only stuff you have to work with is finite

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.680
in terms of having finite data and so on.

01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:56.760
And what I'm hearing, I'm very directly from David

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.000
and I think implicitly,

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.400
or maybe directly too from Charlie.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:03.240
Anyway, I'm hearing in both your comments

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.800
that the problem of the arrow of time

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.560
or the problem of bolts and brains

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.360
or however you wanna put it

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.800
is looming enough to transcend.

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:17.640
That's forcing us away from that position.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:22.360
Making us love infinity.

01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.360
Yeah, and I will say that whatever,

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.520
wherever I am in my prejudices and all of that with that,

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:36.760
I think that problem looms so mightily

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:39.200
that I have to respect.

01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.640
Even though you're doing stuff that I find uncomfortable,

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:48.800
that problem looms so mightily that I respect.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.840
It's very radical to me,

01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.440
it's very radical what you're trying to do,

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.480
but something has to give.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.360
Oscar Wilde said, we're all in the gutter,

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:03.080
but some of us are looking at the stars.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.040
Well, some of us are looking at infinity,

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.680
because it solves problems here and now.

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:13.520
But it seems to me like a cheat.

01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.680
That's, I think that's,

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.640
so I think you're also giving up.

01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.720
So, and I think you're explicitly saying

01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:23.240
that you're giving up on the standard ways

01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:25.240
we think about doing physics.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:30.240
And whether it's embracing some beautiful, better thing

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:33.520
or giving up is a little hard for me to tell.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:36.760
We've embraced the continuum for centuries.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.480
Yeah, just a derivative that we do in classical.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:40.320
And derivatives, yes.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:43.240
But it doesn't, but it's for, okay,

01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:47.800
but that's only to make our life easier.

01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:51.880
And if it were discreet instead, it wouldn't change it.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.720
It wouldn't be a radical thing to put it on a lattice.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:56.640
We're not here to make our lives easier,

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:58.280
we're here to understand the world.

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.520
And that's why these continuums and derivatives

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:07.080
and all that infinite stuff was invented, was conjectured.

01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:09.080
And it might be false, but it might not be.

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.880
Well, you shouldn't have prejudices about these things.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.880
But our, yes, that's fine.

01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:19.640
I like your line.

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:24.640
I find the finiteness of physics.

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:30.280
Physics is finite, except you're saying,

01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:33.760
what I'm hearing is, okay, physics might be finite,

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:37.120
but except for the arrow of time problem, forcing us out.

01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:40.640
I don't think the continuum forces us to infinity.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.640
We can have a lattice,

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:44.520
we can have all kinds of things that do just fine.

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.360
But you're saying this is the one thing

01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.880
that forces us to think about infinity, which is intriguing.

01:16:52.360 --> 01:16:53.800
I'd like to go in the audience

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:56.920
and give the chance for some students to ask questions.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.280
If any one of you have a question.

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:02.280
Hi.

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.280
I'm not sure whether I understood why

01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.280
incompleteness is fundamental for non-equilibrium phenomena

01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.280
and so forth life.

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.280
I think it was a point of David that he made before.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.280
Yeah.

01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:22.280
So I'd like maybe more comments about that.

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280
No, thank you.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.280
Cool.

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:25.280
Thanks.

01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.280
David, would you like to react?

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.280
I'm sure Charlie could do this better.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:38.280
But, but I, I, the connection is that if you have to look

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:44.280
at the contrapositive, if there is a limitation

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.280
such as Hilbert imagined,

01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:55.280
that you can write out an algorithm

01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:58.280
that will be a criterion of truth,

01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:03.280
then mathematics has stopped at that point.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.280
And the same would be true of physics.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:13.280
If, if, if there was a knowable law of physics

01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:15.280
that predicted everything,

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.280
then that would be the end of physics.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:21.280
And if there were such a thing as,

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:26.280
and if there were such a thing as life in a universe,

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:29.280
which I think there couldn't be, but if, if there were,

01:18:29.280 --> 01:18:33.280
then it would really mean that the design of the most

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.280
complicated creature that could exist,

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:38.280
which would be finitely complicated,

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:43.280
would exist baked into the, to the laws of physics

01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:45.280
at the big bang.

01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:50.280
So, you know, the, the, the universe would not have anything

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.280
that would not have any of the kinds of openness,

01:18:54.280 --> 01:19:00.280
explain the complexity and the, all the high level structure.

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:09.280
If, if it were not, if, if, if there were infallible truths

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.280
available that the other way around,

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.280
unless there were fallibility.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:20.280
So, Charlie, yeah.

01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280
Yeah, I think that's right.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:28.280
That, that is that if, if you didn't have,

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:32.280
it's because

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.280
incompleteness is the flip side of universality.

01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:41.280
If you had a, if you restricted the,

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:47.280
the laws of nature to, to something in which you couldn't

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.280
produce a universal computer,

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:55.280
of course it would be limited by how long it could run before,

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.280
but basically something that was behaving like a Turing machine

01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.280
until some, some part broke.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.280
Then you couldn't get something as complicated as, as, as a,

01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:13.280
a, a bacterium.

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.280
Thanks.

01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:19.280
Are there any other questions from the audience?

01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:30.280
Yeah, Vincent, would you like to come?

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.280
So, hello, thank you so much for the great discussion.

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:36.280
Maybe I have a question about a bit of a different topic,

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:39.280
namely about artificial intelligence and AGI maybe,

01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.280
because some of us are interested in this.

01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:47.280
So from the Turing church thesis,

01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.280
we know that our brains are not doing anything magical.

01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:53.280
They could be simulated by a Turing machine, right?

01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.280
So that means, in principle, some,

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.280
we could implement something like AGI if you,

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.280
if we would know how,

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:04.280
but it could be that the only way, at least in my view,

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:07.280
the only way to implement this is to simulate something

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:10.280
like a human brain on a Turing machine,

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:13.280
not that there's any simple AGI program that does something

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.280
like human level intelligence or creativity,

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:21.280
or maybe there is any reason we might get there,

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.280
or do you think there is any reason that we should expect

01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.280
a simple program that implements AGI,

01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.280
or is, do we have to take the detour

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.280
to simulate something like a human brain,

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:33.280
and this then...

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.280
Well, the human brain might be simple,

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:37.280
looked at the right way.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:42.280
I think simple doesn't necessarily mean easy to find.

01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.280
I think there is a very strong reason to believe

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.280
that the explanatory universality property

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:56.280
of the human brain, which are present only humans have,

01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:01.280
must be encoded in a very short amount of DNA,

01:22:01.280 --> 01:22:03.280
a tiny amount.

01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:05.280
People have different numbers for this,

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:10.280
but we seem to be 95% or 99% of our DNA

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.280
is the same as chimpanzees,

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.280
and of the rest, a lot is junk DNA,

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:20.280
and of the rest, a lot is differences between us

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.280
and chimpanzees that aren't connected

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.280
with these deep epistemological things.

01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:32.280
So maybe it's only a few K of code in DNA terms

01:22:32.280 --> 01:22:38.280
that encodes the AGI-ness or the GI-ness of the brain,

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:41.280
but that doesn't mean it's easy to find.

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.280
I would guess that it is a short program.

01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:49.280
I mean, a few K of program is actually long if you want to write it,

01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:55.280
but it's relatively short compared with the kinds of things

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.280
that happen in biology.

01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.280
And I think it'll be very hard to find,

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:05.280
and probably, well, I would expect us to find it

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:11.280
only once we have understood a philosophical theory

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.280
of what the function is,

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:20.280
what the creativity, consciousness, qualia, and so on,

01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:25.280
what those things are in some precise terms,

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.280
precise but high level, I would expect.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.280
And then we can probably quite easily write a program

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:35.280
that has that property.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.280
Then we'll be in various kinds of trouble,

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.280
but not any of the kinds of trouble

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.280
that people are thinking about now.

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.280
I worry that people who know more about it

01:23:47.280 --> 01:23:56.280
are scared about it, but people are so good

01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:00.280
at being cruel to each other with their intelligence

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:06.280
that I doubt that the machines would do much worse.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:12.280
And I take this Schopenhauer's principle,

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.280
which is what they should call the anthropic principle

01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:21.280
pretty seriously, and it may be that we're not likely

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:30.280
to last more than a few or decades before we...

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.280
I don't think that human civilization will extinct itself,

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:40.280
it might set us back a few centuries or millennia.

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:46.280
And we just hope for the best, but...

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:52.280
So that's why I don't worry about it so much,

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.280
but maybe I should.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.280
Oh, I know, it's also, if you want to be universal,

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.280
not in the sense of computational universality,

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:06.280
but in the sense of the Universal Declaration

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:10.280
of Human Rights, where do we get off thinking

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:14.280
that we have better rights than these machines?

01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.280
They might actually do a better job,

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:21.280
or they might be our successors,

01:25:21.280 --> 01:25:27.280
not in the sense of the ones that conquered us

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:33.280
and enslaved us, but in a way that provided a shortcut

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:38.280
to what may be...

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:45.280
To the bad instincts, or let's say the maladaptive instincts

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:49.280
that humans have, and that it might take a bit

01:25:49.280 --> 01:26:03.280
of very unpleasant natural selection to get rid of,

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:08.280
and maybe the artificial intelligence would make a shortcut to...

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.280
So you're saying AI rights might be better people?

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.280
Yeah, in other words, another way of doing it

01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:18.280
would be giving us a transplant of bonobo genes

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:23.280
or something that just makes us more susceptible

01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.280
to taking it easy and less susceptible to getting angry

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.280
at our neighbors because of misinformation

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.280
we've heard about them and going on killing them,

01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:38.280
which seems to be the tendency people have,

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.280
which probably was very adaptive at one stage,

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:47.280
but is not helping us right now.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:48.280
Thanks.

01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:50.280
You can't believe that in the better angels of our nature,

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.280
and Steven Pinker and all that stuff,

01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:56.280
he says we've been getting better and better.

01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.280
Look, if civilization...

01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.280
No, that's tendency,

01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.280
but there are also strong tendencies in the other direction.

01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.280
We saw in the 20th century it got pretty bad,

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.280
and it could do so again.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:16.280
It's worse now because the reach of things

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:19.280
is even more global than it was in the 20th century.

01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.280
So a very repressive world government

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.280
would be harder to dislodge.

01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:32.280
There's a more fundamental reason why you're right,

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:35.280
namely because of fallibilism.

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:40.280
There can be no upper bound to the size of error we can make.

01:27:40.280 --> 01:27:45.280
So although we have the potential

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:52.280
to go exponentially into the future at infinite.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:55.280
We have the potential to make arbitrarily large errors,

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:58.280
and we may have a dark age and another dark age,

01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.280
and a dark age lasting a million years,

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.280
or we might wipe ourselves out,

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:05.280
and something else might evolve somewhere else in the universe

01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:07.280
or somewhere else in the multiverse.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:11.280
And there can be no guarantee that that won't happen.

01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.280
There can be no even...

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:18.280
There can be no guarantee that it probably won't happen.

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:23.280
So what we have to do is solve problems as we find them

01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:26.280
and create knowledge as we can,

01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:35.280
and not rely on supernatural guarantees.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:41.280
I thought you'd like that point about the finite bound.

01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:46.280
Are there any other questions from the audience?

01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:50.280
Adita?

01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:58.280
I'm changing chairs depending on which side people come.

01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:02.280
Hi, so I had a question because of this discussion

01:29:02.280 --> 01:29:07.280
we spent about discussing about how undecidability

01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:11.280
and the halting problem are, I guess, flip sides of the same problem.

01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:12.280
Would you also say that...

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.280
Universality.

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:16.280
Sorry, yeah, universality and the halting problem

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.280
are the kind of opposite sides of the same problem.

01:29:19.280 --> 01:29:23.280
Would you also say that these are opposite sides of induction

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.280
and deduction as ways to kind of acquire knowledge,

01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.280
because we talked about, I guess,

01:29:29.280 --> 01:29:32.280
Solmanov induction a little bit in the beginning

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:37.280
and how maybe that is one conceptualization

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:40.280
of how you could derive knowledge from...

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:43.280
Instead of using deduction from a formal set of axioms,

01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:45.280
where you would use data instead.

01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.280
So would you say that the incompatibility of something

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:55.280
like ideal induction is the same as not being able to deduce

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:58.280
because of incompleteness?

01:29:58.280 --> 01:30:02.280
Yes, they are both impossible for the same reason

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:06.280
and their impossibility is a very good thing for the same reason.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:11.280
So in both cases, instead of deriving things,

01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:14.280
we have to guess things, we have to conjecture,

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.280
and the conjectures are always fallible.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.280
And I'm spouting Popper's philosophy here,

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:24.280
so that's where you have to go for this.

01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:29.280
And he got an amazing number of things right

01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:34.280
working almost in isolation.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:36.280
To link to relate to Adita's point,

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.280
I think also Solmanov's induction is an idealization,

01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:41.280
and to have Solmanov's metric,

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:43.280
one needs to solve the halting problem.

01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:45.280
But in concrete applications,

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:49.280
one cannot find Solmanov's prior.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.280
And so what we do, as you know,

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.280
upper semi-computed perhaps,

01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:57.280
and then come up with guesses,

01:30:57.280 --> 01:31:01.280
oh, maybe this phenomenon from which I got these data

01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:04.280
has been explained by this program.

01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:06.280
Now everything is programs,

01:31:06.280 --> 01:31:10.280
but one can come up with this.

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.280
That's also a problem,

01:31:12.280 --> 01:31:15.280
how we link scientific explanations with programs.

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:19.280
But I think there is a bit of a Popperian flavor

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:21.280
in Solmanov's induction once we realize

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:24.280
that it's uncomputable, so forget it.

01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.280
It's a beautiful idea.

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:28.280
It does converge to whatever it needs to converge.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.280
But the fact that it's uncomputable,

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:32.280
we can only guess programs.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:36.280
The thing is, usually, or often, shall I say,

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:41.280
often the problem we're trying to solve isn't in data.

01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:43.280
We haven't yet got any data.

01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:46.280
Sometimes it's a theoretical problem.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:52.280
I think how is it possible for Maxwell's equations to be true

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:55.280
and geometry to be what we think it is?

01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:58.280
There's no data, no data at all.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:04.280
So you have the problem first, then the theory, then the data.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:10.280
And so induction of any kind simply can't exist

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:13.280
in that kind of a reality.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:19.280
And as I keep saying, it's a very good thing that it can't.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:24.280
So Solmanov is trying to solve a problem that isn't there.

01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.280
He's trying to say, how can we make this induction

01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:32.280
or this Bayesian inference or whatever make sense?

01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:34.280
How can we get the priors right?

01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.280
Well, the priors aren't right.

01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:39.280
Get over it.

01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:46.280
Well, my colleague, John Smolen, told me about the story of induction

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:56.280
and about an explorer who comes to a place that's inhabited by anti-inductionists.

01:32:56.280 --> 01:33:00.280
And these are people who believe that if something happened once,

01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.280
it's less likely to happen again.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:10.280
And they have a miserable life because their buildings fall down

01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:12.280
and their crops fail.

01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:18.280
And so this explorer says, I understand why everything is not working here.

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:25.280
It's because your principle of anti-induction is wrong.

01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:27.280
And they looked at him and they said,

01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:29.280
why should we give up this principle?

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.280
It's never worked before.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:36.280
Nice.

01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:37.280
Good.

01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:38.280
Thank you.

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:43.280
Thank you so much for your answers.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:46.280
Other questions?

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:50.280
Sam.

01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.280
I'm interested in what kinds of cosmology.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:34:02.280
I mean, we have the cosmology for people like Hitler.

01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.280
There's Barbas cosmology.

01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.280
Let's try to get them again.

01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:09.280
I'm just curious what interests them at the moment.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:15.280
Well, I don't know a lot about it, but I've been trying to understand these models.

01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:20.280
They call eternal inflation where there isn't a beginning or an end,

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:26.280
but in which there's inflating pockets that appear here and there

01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:29.280
with all sorts of different natural laws in them.

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:36.280
And in that, that's a pretty scary place to live.

01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:41.280
And it's populated by all kinds of problems, like David mentioned,

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:49.280
that it's hard to get a universe in which you're not extremely

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:59.280
likely to disappear in a microsecond from now.

01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:06.280
Other questions from the group?

01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:10.280
If they come up later, be free to feel free to raise your hand at some point.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:15.280
And at this stage, I could also take questions from the, from the online event.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:19.280
I would have a quick question.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.280
Go ahead, Sophie.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.280
Yes.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:30.280
I'm wondering when you're talking about other universes that would have maybe

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:33.280
they could solve the whole thing problem and for them, it's pretty easy,

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:38.280
but for us, it's difficult and vice versa for other tasks.

01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:46.280
Are you thinking about other branches in the multiverse or something that

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:49.280
would be completely outside of what we are studying now?

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:51.280
The latter.

01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:59.280
In the multiverse, there's no, all universes in the quantum multiverse

01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:02.280
have the same tame mathematics.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:07.280
They even have the same computable functions.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:13.280
They just have different complexity theory, but complexity theory isn't that important anyway.

01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:23.280
So, yeah, but, but we have to, we have to consider universes with different laws,

01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:30.280
if only to, to examine explanations like the anthropic principle, which purport to

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:40.280
different things in our universe and only, only certain very special kinds of anthropic argument constitute arguments.

01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:55.280
They, otherwise they, they simply fall victim to this Boltzmann brain or boundary of the, of the set of possibilities problem.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:37:14.280
In his Sharma, when he was, when he told us about this objection, he said that what we should really look for anthropically is for is a case, not not a case where a slight change in a fundamental law would have meant that we're not here,

01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:19.280
but where the, but where we are located at the center of the region.

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:30.280
So, if we, if we really define structure constant, rather than saying, you know, if it was 1% different, we wouldn't be here.

01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:37.280
Look at the region where we would be here and, and try to find out whether we're near the center.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:43.280
If we're near the center, that, that is a real anthropic problem.

01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:50.280
You know, if you tell this to religious people, they're going to say it's God, and it's very hard to argue them out of it.

01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:54.280
But I don't think we will be in the center.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:03.280
But I think you don't think we're also on the edges, because if we're on the edges, we're out of it right after where we're neither at the center of the edges because that's not where the explanation lies.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:12.280
The explanation of the actual values doesn't doesn't lie in our existence.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:22.280
It's a common cause is caused by things like the law of the, of the universality of computation.

01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.280
I was about to say side effect. Yeah.

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:25.280
Yeah.

01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:28.280
Yeah.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.280
Thank you.

01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.280
Are there other questions.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:41.280
We're not at the middle and we're not at the edge exactly how far from the edge are we.

01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:51.280
Probably a non computable amount or an intractably computable amount.

01:38:51.280 --> 01:39:05.280
David, I'm just curious. This is a small question, but I'm just curious. So your comments about the thought the sort of unpredictability of the future of our civilization and the possibility of our demise.

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:11.280
Is that, is that the same thing as this edge that we've been talking about?

01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:13.280
Do you see a difference?

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:15.280
Yeah, yeah.

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:25.280
It's almost the opposite. It's, it's the, it's to do with our fallibility, which is to do with our capacity for infinite growth.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:26.280
Good.

01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:29.280
That's, that's interesting. Yeah.

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:37.280
So it's, it's, it's our hope as well as our possible demise.

01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:49.280
Well, you know, I'm not expecting our possible demise. I think, you know, arguing that there will be a dis demise is itself not legitimate. That's a prophecy.

01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:54.280
No, no, no, but, but it's in the scope, but, but it's, it's not.

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:58.280
You're saying we can't be sure to avoid it.

01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:03.280
Yeah, it's, it's on the future of knowledge is unknowable.

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:07.280
Again, we've got to get over that.

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:17.280
That's, you're saying, unlike other predictions, it's not false survival because if, if, if there is a demise.

01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:34.280
I think, I think Gilles Brassard was wrote a book on your computation in which it had a cartoon of a bunch of elderly scientists looking into a steaming test tube.

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:45.280
And one of them is saying, we may have discovered the elixir of immortality, but it will take forever to test it.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:57.280
Any more questions.

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:01.280
I would have another question maybe for Charles.

01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:07.280
And I wonder what's your view of probabilities.

01:41:07.280 --> 01:41:09.280
My view of probability.

01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:11.280
Yep.

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:27.280
I think it's just, I think it arises from entanglement.

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:45.280
Yes, I think that is the, the problem is, is the feature of a subsystem in a, in a larger system that, that evolves uniterally.

01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:56.280
My question would also could also be formulated as do you agree with David in terms of what our probabilities, and I guess the answer is yes.

01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:05.280
Not necessarily because many people view probabilities as entanglement because they understand quantum theory as unitary and so entanglement is out there.

01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:12.280
But even, even among these people, there's still many disagreements about how we should read the born rule.

01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:23.280
So, so maybe the follow up question for Charlie without, without being so specific as does it equate to David's, despite you embrace unitary quantum theory.

01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.280
Still, how do you view the born rule.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:28.280
Is it a decision.

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:41.280
Yeah, it's, it's, it's hard. I try not to think about it, but I know.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:45.280
Do we have an answer on that.

01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:56.280
Yes, I think, I think the decision theory approach to probability in quantum mechanics is correct and sufficient.

01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:11.280
Whether you whether you call that deriving the born rule. I don't know, I think the born rule is a is not a universal rule obviously because it doesn't apply to quantum theory.

01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:20.280
I mean, it only applies to quantum theory at a tiny minority of of in a tiny minority of situations.

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:29.280
In those situations, modeling the, the situation with decision theory.

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:41.280
The decision theory theory approach if I can say very quickly is to take decision classical decision theory and quantum theory strip out all the probability from classical decision theory.

01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:59.280
All the probabilistic axioms and so on. And then quantum theory strip out the probabilistic, you know, if you're going to have wave function collapse or something strip out all that stuff, anything that's supposed to be probabilistic, then smush them together.

01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:14.280
Consistent quantum theory, namely Everett's, and you get a consistent theory probability, which only applies when people are making decisions.

01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:23.280
And the rule that they use assuming that they make measurements accurately and all that stuff in that approximation.

01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:40.280
Their rational behavior as determined by decision theory is the same as it would be if they believed in stochastic processes, even those stochastic processes do not happen in nature.

01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:50.280
Yeah, that sounds pretty plausible.

01:44:50.280 --> 01:45:03.280
I'm not sure I properly understood your explanation, David, because if you say you want to get rid of the born rule and you believe in a unitary quantum mechanics and and Everett's many worlds interpretation.

01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:20.280
How do you reconcile the fact that when we do a quantum experiment in the lab, we, you know, we just get to see one result. How do we, how do we interpret the fact that we're in just a specific branch of the multiverse and say not another one.

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:38.280
Why not? We're in all of them. And the fact that we see only one outcome is a prediction of quantum theory. If you if you just write the equation for with the variable for how many outcomes do we see, then you will find that the world after a good measurement, the world will be in an

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:42.280
eigenstate of that with eigenvalue one.

01:45:42.280 --> 01:45:49.280
Okay, so what actually happens is that all of the outcomes happen. I mean, generically.

01:45:50.280 --> 01:46:00.280
But the question was about probability. What do we then mean that some of them have a high prior probability than others, given that they all happen.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:13.280
Then you have to bring in another part of the model, which is, suppose we were betting on these outcomes. How would it be rational to bet.

01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:25.280
And decision theory without probabilistic axioms and quantum theory without them together, give the answer.

01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:31.280
It's magic.

01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:38.280
You're shaking your head, but if you read the papers, it's, it's, I think it's unanswerable.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.280
I mean, it's, it's undeniable.

01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:48.280
Do you think it's unanswerable or just we haven't found a good explanation for it. Yes.

01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:55.280
It's too ambiguous at word. I mean, it's undeniable that this is the explanation.

01:46:55.280 --> 01:47:05.280
So, David has amidst his other euphemisms and disphemisms.

01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:31.280
And what is, I regard the, the, the most widespread obfuscatory euphemism God, that is, people, people use it to mean their own idea of God, which they're going to try to get you to like and believe in, but they haven't actually said what it is yet.

01:47:31.280 --> 01:47:37.280
So, I'm going to use that also, but in a physicist's way.

01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:50.280
So, if you imagine a conversation with God, and, and first of all, you say, what time is it. And God says, well, you would say it's it's about here.

01:47:51.280 --> 01:48:02.280
It's about 1037 Eastern daylight time. But for me, it's all times. I'm eternal.

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:10.280
And then you'll say, well, you're supposed to be omniscient of will it rain a year from now.

01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:17.280
And God says, well, that's like, yes and no.

01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:27.280
Well, it rained for me from now. Well, I say, it's like saying what I see is, is something that looks like your hand.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:35.280
And you're sitting here, and you're saying, which of my fingers is the correct extension of my wrist.

01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:46.280
They all are, when it gets to be next year, you'll either be on one where it's raining, which is the one that has my wedding ring, or you'll be one of the other ones where it isn't raining.

01:48:47.280 --> 01:49:07.280
And I can see all of them. But, but, and, and you, for you now, they're all equally real. And then in a next year, you will have a kind of a truncated perspective in which you think one of them is real and the others aren't, but they all still are.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:16.280
I'm not going to think that I know that the other branches exist, even if I can't see them.

01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:19.280
Most things in the universe I can't see.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.280
I don't know why that's so, so.

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:38.280
It's like this, what Galileo said, he says, I don't know if he actually said this, but he says that it's a yes, I say that the earth moves and if it moves the way I say it is you shouldn't be able to feel it moving so shut up.

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.280
Yeah, pretty much.

01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.280
Ever said that to do it. Yes.

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:46.280
Yeah, yeah, you didn't use the Galileo example.

01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:54.280
Yes, absolutely. Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. And is that the moment where David started to say, Okay, I don't know what more to argue against.

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:59.280
Yeah, that's the moment he was convinced. Yeah.

01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:04.280
So, so the idea is even the theory says

01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.280
Yes, you will only experience one outcome.

01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:08.280
Yes.

01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:18.280
So, even though we seem to be bugged by the fact that no, but the theory says there's going to be many outcomes. No, no, no, it might look like the theory says there's going to be many outcomes.

01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:26.280
But if, if each of, if you ask yourself what how many outcomes am I going to see the theory says systematically only one.

01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:37.280
So it preserves its consistency in spite of its striking apparent inconsistency.

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:45.280
And are there other questions.

01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:48.280
Hey, do you hear me.

01:50:48.280 --> 01:51:02.280
Yeah, so, so will you will you say well any of you say that in that sense, in the sense we just discussed now, the principle will be a statement about consciousness of what do you experience.

01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:10.280
Or do you think it's beyond like consciousness will be beyond the scope of the statement.

01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:27.280
It has nothing to do with it. It's, I mean, obviously, if consciousness is to be described as a physical process which it must be, then it presumably a base quantum theory and so on but it has nothing to do with these issues of

01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:35.280
measurement probability and anything like that it's it's just a physical thing.

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:46.280
There's there's no more reason to assume it has a special place in physics, then it would be to assume that squirrels have a special place in physics.

01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:54.280
Obviously they describe that physics, but they don't have any relevance to fundamental discussions of physics.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:52:08.280
Well, I asked before, because the idea was like, I mean, the, the following if I'm following the discussion is that, like, you have this different potential outcomes of measurement, all of them occur, all of them have their own branches and all of them are there.

01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:13.280
But the statement is more like the one do you will experience one of them.

01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:24.280
And then it's if it's about, you will experience one of them, you will see one of them is wouldn't be addressing directly the consciousness of, or maybe I'm just like going out.

01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:42.280
It's the same question can be asked about a seed of a plant that grows into two trees, the left one and the right one and you ask the seed are you going to be the left one or the right one or or twins you know you are are you going to be Joe or Fred.

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:53.280
You ask the, the fertilized egg. And it says to you, well, in a sense, I'm going to be both of them. In a sense, I'm only going to be one of them.

01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.280
That is to say, I will not experience being both.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:02.280
But the experience of being each of them will both happen.

01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:05.280
Okay, I see. I understand.

01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:09.280
That's a good way of putting it. Yeah.

01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:15.280
Well, David and Charlie have been tremendously generous of their time.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:26.280
It doesn't seems like there's other questions. If somebody has a burning desire and has been repressing his question. This is the last call.

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.280
It also applies for the audience.

01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:30.280
Great.

01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:43.280
Thank you so much, David and Charlie. That was a lot of fun to discuss with you. And it was a very, very fascinating in many regards.

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:48.280
Thank you very much. Very, very interesting conversation.

01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:50.280
Thank you. Hi everyone.

01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:51.280
Thanks a lot. This was great.
