============================
Checking The 92nd Street Y, New York/Christopher Hitchens and Tariq Ramadan Debate： Is Islam a Religion of Peace？.txt
1. **Dawkins on Sharia**: Richard Dawkins clarifies that Sharia, which means "law," is often misunderstood. It is not the case that all aspects of Sharia are strictly enforced in Muslim societies. He points out that religions, including Islam, are man-made and have enormous discrepancies in how they are practiced and enforced across different societies. He mentions examples like women's rights in Saudi Arabia versus Iran to illustrate the variation in how religious laws are applied.

2. **Chaudhary's Remark**: Dawkins recounts an interaction with Anjum Chaudhary, a British Muslim commentator, who was asked by the BBC if he wouldn't prefer to live in a country that already practices Sharia law. Chaudhary's response was provocative: "What makes you think this is your country?" Dawkins finds this question significant because it suggests that some immigrants view their host countries as temporarily occupied until a global Islamic state (caliphate) is established.

3. **Immigrants and Integration**: Dawkins notes that not all immigrants feel the need to question their allegiance to their host countries as Chaudhary did. However, he suggests that those who advocate for the establishment of Sharia law in Western societies are a group that should be critically examined and opposed if one is consistent in valuing secular laws and human rights.

4. **Best Place for Muslims in Minority Groups**: In response to a question about where a Muslim who is also part of a sexual or gender minority would find the best place to live, Dawkins recommends Bosnia-Herzegovina or Kosovo. These societies are predominantly Muslim but also have democratic and open traditions, influenced by their history and the support of the United States. He emphasizes the importance of secularism and a godless constitution as the last best hope for humanity.

5. **Closing Remarks**: Dawkins ends with a note of appreciation for the discussion and hopes that the evening has been enlightening for the audience. He reaffirms his stance on the importance of secular laws and human rights over religious ones.
