1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
Wall Street and Big Tech and the City of London together own your identity.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,600
You have to pay to use your own identity.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,960
If we are going to defeat them, and if we're going to turn this into a viable society,

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,480
the global society, we must forget about taxing, we must think in old Marxist terms,

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
how do we take their capital away from them?

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,440
This is not a viable system, it's a system we live in.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,720
We are stampeding towards oblivion.

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,160
Janis Varivakis, hello, how are you?

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,680
Very well.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,000
Good.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm very happy to be here.

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,080
Very happy to have you here.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,400
Before we get into the subject matter today, your book, Technofutilism,

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,360
I'd invite you to tell the audience who you are, what you do, in your own words.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,720
Well, I used to be an academic that no one knew anything about because I was

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:56,400
cocooned in my university office writing esoteric texts that maximum 20 people around

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,400
the world cared for, and I didn't mind, until I started feeling in the early 2000s that the world

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:11,280
is heading towards another 1929 discontinuity, let's put it mildly, and at that moment I thought that

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,480
I don't have the right, the moral right to carry on playing around with my mathematical

20
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:23,920
models of game theory, and I started writing fiery articles and books, including the Global

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,840
Minotaur, which became quite a significant text, even if I'm saying so myself, regardless of 2008.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,080
It was a time when I was also shifting from Australia to my home country, Greece, which was

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:48,160
always going to be ground zero of the European great financial crisis, and at some point

24
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:56,880
having opened my mouth once too often and written too many articles about it, a young man who was

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,960
leading the Greek opposition at the time, this is now 2010, 11, 12, 13, at some point invited me

26
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:15,040
to become the finance minister if he were to win, which I did, and so from obscure mathematical

27
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,440
texts I was elevated to becoming the finance minister of the most bankrupt state in Europe,

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,720
the world, that lasted five, six months because we had a pact, the prime minister and myself,

29
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,840
that we would never accept another bailout loan under conditions of crashing 80% of the population,

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:44,160
he decided that he wanted to surrender, I decided I'm not going to surrender, and that's it, I resigned,

31
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,920
and then created my own party, going from small victory to grand failure, writing books all the

32
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,160
time as therapy, so that's why. Okay, perfect, let's indulge them in another hour of therapy,

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,040
talking about this book, we're going to get into the concepts in it, we're going to go into it in

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,960
detail, but top line for people who are just here to begin with, what's it about, why is it important,

35
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:17,920
why should people read it? We all feel in our bones that this crisis is never ending, it is

36
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,160
metamorphosizing, taking different, you know, from a crisis of deflation, falling prices and

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:29,440
falling wages, it went to a crisis of the cost of living crisis, of inflation, we know that there's

38
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:37,040
something dismally wrong with the world, that you know capitalism was always a system that produced

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:45,280
crisis, and new funding forms of poverty and depravity, but what has been happening over the last

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:55,200
15 years, excuse me, is unique, we haven't experienced that since the 1770s, 1780s, this

41
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,000
so universal sense of angst that everybody shares, including of course about the climate,

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:08,640
and my view is that the reason why we're experiencing this is not that capitalism is going through

43
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,760
another one of its normal crisis, but rather we are at a turning point, very much like the 1770s,

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,520
1780s, when there was a great transformation, as Karl Polanyi put it, from feudalism to capitalism,

45
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,240
and the feudalism power sprang out of the land, anybody who owned land, the land of Gentry,

46
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,640
had power, and it was all sorts of power packed in one, political power, economic power,

47
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,920
cultural power, if you were the aristocracy or part of it, you had it, and you couldn't

48
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:51,120
distinguish between political and economic power, and the wealth came out of rent, the rents that

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,880
the aristocrats of the land of Gentry charged, vassals and peasants and so on, and then there is

50
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:07,600
this great shift from land to machinery to capital, and from rent to profit through the

51
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,320
commodification of land, the commodification of labor, even though peasants worked very hard,

52
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,440
their labor was not a commodity, they couldn't quit, didn't receive a wage, it was no labor market,

53
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,440
similarly for land, there was no market for land, you either had it or you didn't have it,

54
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,200
and then everything was commodified, so that was capitalism, it starts here in this country

55
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,080
and in Amsterdam around the end of the 18th century, and it continues to this day.

56
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,400
Now, I mentioned before that it was in the 2000s that I was feeling that some major crisis was

57
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:51,920
coming, and 2008, the city of London, Wall Street, so on, in my estimation, created a rupture in

58
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:57,600
capitalism, it wasn't anything like, not even like 1929, it was even more substantial than that,

59
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,080
and for a number of years I was trying to think about what on earth is happening,

60
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,520
and I came to the very controversial conclusion, which is this book, that in the same way that

61
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,480
we shifted from feudalism to capitalism, we are now shifting, without realizing it, to a new form

62
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,640
of feudalism, a very advanced, almost science fiction form of feudalism, this is why I call it

63
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:27,040
techno feudalism, but essentially, we have a new land, which is the cloud, and we have a new landed

64
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,120
gentry, you can call them cloud delists, or the techno feudal lords, the lords of the cloud,

65
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:40,880
like Jeff Bezos, just one example of Zuckerberg, and power is shifting from the owners of machinery,

66
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:46,160
of standard machines, even industrial robots, even advanced machinery, to the owners of this

67
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,400
network of machines that creates this digital version of land, and just one last point to explain

68
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,040
to our audience what I mean by that, when you enter Amazon.com, or Alibaba, or one of those

69
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,040
digital platforms, people think that they enter a marketplace, they do not enter a marketplace,

70
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,720
they enter a digital fiefdom, because come to think of it, even though you buy yourself,

71
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,120
it's all mediated by an algorithm that belongs to one person, who doesn't produce anything,

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:26,080
except for this landscape. And how does Bezos make his billions? If you produce a book, or, you know,

73
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:34,400
a bicycle, or anything that you sell through Amazon.com, he keeps 40%, that's a rent. Suddenly,

74
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,960
we've gone from profits to rents, but this time, it's not rents that you charge for the use, or the

75
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,720
leasing of land, but the leasing of the clouds, so I call them cloud rents. And the more I thought

76
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,200
about that, the more I convinced myself that this is a great transformation, which is hugely important,

77
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:02,000
not theoretically, but for me, the idea of the liberal individual gone. You can no longer be

78
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,400
a genuine liberal, or even a libertarian, if I'm right. Social democracy gone, because what was

79
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,760
social democracy? It was a kind of mediation between industrial capital and organized liberal

80
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:21,520
gone, because industrial capital now is being exploited by those people. They get 40% of whatever

81
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,440
it is that they produce, and no one is going to negotiate with Jeff Bezos. No government can make

82
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,320
any group of workers sit down with Jeff Bezos, or they can't make Jeff Bezos sit down with any

83
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,600
group of workers and carry out a social democratic bargain, or new deal, or whatever.

84
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
And also, if you look at the clash between the United States and China, why is this happening?

85
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,480
Taiwan is not the reason. Taiwan was always a problem. National security is not the reason.

86
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:01,360
My view is that what you have is two kinds, two cloud fiefdoms clashing. The American one,

87
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,280
based on Silicon Valley and Wall Street, and the Chinese one. Europe is non-existent,

88
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:13,360
because we don't have a cloud. So anyway, that's the whole story, really.

89
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
And we'll drill down their details in the book.

90
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,160
Perfect. And we'll get into those details over the course of this conversation. Before we do get

91
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,200
on to that subject matter, I'd like to loiter around this point about the end of capitalism,

92
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,480
about what's killing capitalism, and whether or not you mentioned 2008, 2009. Is it fair to say

93
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,240
whether actually capital is the force that's causing capitalism to come to an end at the moment?

94
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,480
That's a great irony. I'm a Marxist, I'm a left-winger, full disclosure folks.

95
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
And I remain a Marxist. And I think that this is a Marxist analysis.

96
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,120
I mean, there's even an appendix with a Marxist political economy take for

97
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,240
nerds. If you're a nerd Marxist and you want to look at what is the actual political,

98
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,320
Marxist political economy behind this book, there's an appendix. You don't have to read it,

99
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,400
but it's there for you to tell people that you read it.

100
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,360
Yeah, of course.

101
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,720
So I'm saying this because we of the left always imagined that we were brought to this earth

102
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:20,080
by chance and nature and whatever, in order to overthrow capitalism. That capitalism will be

103
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:27,120
overthrown by the organized left, by the organized labor unions. Didn't happen, we failed. We are

104
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,680
dismal abysmal failures. No doubt about that, right? All of us. Yep.

105
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:40,000
So what did the trick? Capital. Capital went through a historic mutation

106
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,800
from a produced means of production. Because if you think about a fishing rod, a steam engine,

107
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,720
an industrial robot, it's something we have produced in order to produce all this stuff.

108
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,800
It's a produced means of production. But cloud capital is a produced means of behavior modification.

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,920
That's very different. So effectively, you've taken the, if you remember Mad Men, the wonderful

110
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,720
television series and Don Draper, right? So you automate Don Draper. You turn him into Alexa.

111
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,640
And he does much more than simply put ideas into your mind as to what you want. Firstly,

112
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,320
it trains you to train it, to train you to train it, to input into your mind preferences.

113
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,840
And at the same time, the moment you have that preference for something,

114
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,000
that need for some good, it sells it to you by passing all markets.

115
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,440
In that sense, capital has over the capitalism.

116
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:46,160
So talk about this Amazon Alexa example a little bit more, because this cloud capital

117
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,160
idea is what underpins techno feudalism, right? How does it differ from traditional capital?

118
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,480
You covered it just a little bit. And also, how does it turn us, the user, if you like,

119
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
into the serfs of feudalism past?

120
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:10,560
Advertisers have always been in the business of indoctrinating us, right? Of putting ideas,

121
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,280
of manufacturing desires in our soul. This is the major transformation, transition

122
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:22,000
from early capitalism to more advanced monopoly capitalism after the Second World War.

123
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,400
In the 19th century, the capitalism that Adam Smith was talking about was all about producing

124
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:37,040
bread and, you know, ale and meat and carriages and horse manure and stuff, things that people

125
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,880
needed through a market-based mechanism for distributing productive resources.

126
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,840
And using the price mechanism in order to equilibrate demand and supply and all that.

127
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,200
That's before the war. After the war, you've got the big conglomerates in the United States,

128
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,960
primarily, that emerged from the war economy. They have this huge, immense productive capacity.

129
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:06,160
They can produce a lot more washing machines that American families wanted. So they had to find

130
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:14,560
markets outside. And they needed to manufacture desires in our soul for the things that they

131
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,160
could produce, because they could produce a lot more than what we needed. So they had to convince

132
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,320
us that we needed more than we needed. And that's von Draper. That's advertising, right?

133
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,640
But that was human beings. It was a new profession, the purpose of which was to convince you to buy

134
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:37,200
stuff. One way street. Don Draper comes up with an idea, wonderful poster on the motorway. You sit,

135
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,040
you say, I want that, then you go and buy it. Okay. Still a very significant change back in the 50s,

136
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:53,840
60s, 70s and so on. Today, what you have is Alexa sitting on your desk or Siri on your phone

137
00:13:53,840 --> 00:14:02,800
or Google Assistant, all those contraptions, which present themselves as your slaves. So you say, you

138
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:15,040
know, set the alarm clock for 1035, order milk, tell me a story, play music, stream a video,

139
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,880
all those things. So it's great. I mean, I'm addicted to all those machines, right? I'm not a

140
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:28,160
Luddite or a neo Luddite by any stage of the imagination. But that's not what Alexa is.

141
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,640
Alexa is an interface with cloud capital belonging to one man or to a few men, usually men.

142
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:44,960
And what you do is you give it information about yourself. So you train it so that it knows you.

143
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,680
And then it starts giving you recommendations about books to read, pieces of music to listen to,

144
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,360
films to watch, which are spore on. I don't know about you, but when Spotify recommends music,

145
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,160
it's usually music I like. When Amazon recommends books, it's always books I want to read. It knows

146
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,160
me, right? Which is very impressive. And we are impressionable people. So when Alexa recommends

147
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,120
something to me day after in day out that I want, at some point, when she recommends something else,

148
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,920
I will want it or I will at least buy it. And it will always be quite close, not exactly what I

149
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:31,680
would have selected without her, her of it, but quite close, right? So this is a two way street.

150
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,960
This is an infinite regress. I tell it things so that you can tell me things so I can tell

151
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:45,040
things and therefore it acquires a great deal of power over my thinking and my preferences

152
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,600
and my desires and my aspirations even. And the most important thing here is that it is the same

153
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,280
software, the same mechanism, not just software, warehousing and all that, that can actually send

154
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:03,600
it to me directly by passing any capitalist. The capitalist then becomes a vessel to that.

155
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:11,360
So this is what is so different to Don Draper. Don Draper could not sell you anything

156
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,640
himself. He could convince you to go into the shops and buy it. And one final thing.

157
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:25,440
There isn't why this cloud capital in my book and in my mind is very different to very advanced

158
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,280
pieces of technology like rockets or industrial robots, which are also very advanced contraptions.

159
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:38,640
But the great difference is that capital until now required waged labor to be created.

160
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,240
So from the steam engines to the industrial robots today, there were workers, there are workers,

161
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,320
in factories, together with machines and other robots and other pieces of produced means of

162
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,160
production that actually build the stuff. So you need a capitalist who employs labor, machinery,

163
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:03,840
buildings, electricity, technology and so on to produce the capital, not Amazon.com,

164
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,200
not cloud capital. Most of cloud capital is produced by me and you because you know that very well

165
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:20,960
that why can't we compete with Elon Musk's former Twitter ex, even if you and I were great coders

166
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:31,040
and produced such a network, such a piece of software for short form debating, which is much

167
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:37,120
better than Twitter, even if we did. Who would join it? Yeah, all our followers are on Twitter.

168
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:49,840
Ex, I can't say it. So the capital of ex is us and all our tweets. Amazon.com, every time you

169
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:56,960
buy something or you like something or you upload a review of some book or some product,

170
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,960
you're adding to the capital stock. So we are creating the, you know, a large part of cloud

171
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,200
capital. So cloud capital is a new form of capital because of the way it reproduces itself.

172
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:16,480
It can reproduce itself using self labor by people who don't even know themselves. So that's why I

173
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,920
call them called us cloud serves because we do all this work. Even if we don't do anything,

174
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,440
just we have our phone on us and we're walking around London, Google Maps knows where we are

175
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:34,880
and that enriches its capacity. It's cloud capital for telling people where it's congested,

176
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,480
where they shouldn't go, whether, you know, this shop is a popular one or less popular one.

177
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:50,320
So capital that produces and that produces itself, that is a major discontinuity in the

178
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,400
development of our technologies and the socioeconomic system we live in.

179
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,240
We'll talk about this point in more detail in a moment, I think, because it's interesting that

180
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,440
Shoshana Zuboff in surveillance capitalism, she argues that those inputs, those behavioral

181
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,840
or activities that the companies then monetize, that it forms part of a new capitalist system,

182
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,960
it doesn't go as far as saying feudalism, but maybe we can talk about that in a moment.

183
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,840
But I just wanted to pick you up on, you referred to Alexa as she instead of it.

184
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,000
And I wonder, maybe you do, maybe you don't, maybe this question goes nowhere, what role

185
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,720
sort of the anthropomorphizing these technologies have of turning them into people,

186
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,160
of turning Alexa into a woman, of turning Syria where you can tell Syria to be, whoever you want

187
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,280
to be, but I wonder if you, whether you think that's significant or perhaps you don't, I don't know.

188
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,200
Of course it is significant. The greater the capacity of the machines to present themselves

189
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:55,680
as humans, the greater the power of this infinite regress where we're training to train us,

190
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,800
to train it, to train us and so on and so forth. Now you mentioned Zuboff and, you know,

191
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,320
an important book, Surveillance Capitalism, from which I've learned and which I think is an important

192
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,640
part of the story, but doesn't go far enough because it continues to treat those corporations

193
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,520
as monopoly capitalists. Now Henry Ford, Thomas Edison were monopoly capitalists.

194
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,560
They had created network companies. I mean Thomas Edison was the Elon Musk of his era.

195
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:31,360
Think about it. In the early years, the first decade, 1903, 1904,

196
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,600
he actually electrocuted a hapless elephant at Coney Island in order to demonstrate

197
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,680
that the electricity, the alternative current that he used which belonged to Westinghouse,

198
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:50,400
which was coming out of a Westinghouse powerhouse, was lethal because he was selling a direct

199
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:57,920
current which would not have killed the elephant or a human being. So concentrated power, huge

200
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:05,920
egos, new fungal technologies. This is all new and the capacity of those people, especially Henry

201
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:13,680
Ford, to monopolize markets through technological advancement and to create desires into people's

202
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:20,720
minds, desires they didn't know they had. This is not new. It's there. Of course, Big Tech has

203
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:30,320
turbocharged it and it is true that they have such direct access through Alexa and Siri and so on

204
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,840
and our phones really, our tablets, to us that that monopoly power, the capacity to monopolize

205
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:45,200
a market is now much greater than it was before the Second World War. However, where I go

206
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:55,840
further is that I'm making the point that Amazon.com and thousands of such companies now

207
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:03,040
all over the world, in Indonesia, in Malaysia, especially in Africa, this shift from the market

208
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:12,480
to digital platforms, these digital platforms are not markets and the, I mean, Ford, how did he

209
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,800
make his money? Selling cars. He made the cars and sold them to you. Now the owners of these platforms

210
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:27,360
of the cloud do not make anything. They are go-betweens. They are essentially renters

211
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:33,520
and you might say, well, why don't we call it an entire capitalism? Well, we could. In the same way

212
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,600
we could call capitalism industrial feudalism. It wouldn't be wrong, but it wouldn't allow our

213
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,360
minds to concentrate on the fact that here is a great transformation to another social system which

214
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:52,800
relies on rents, not on monopoly profits. That's the great difference with Ford, the great difference

215
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,640
with Hilton, the great difference with McDonald's. All those people actually produced goods and

216
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:06,320
services that they monopolized and convinced you you really needed them. Basis and the rest

217
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:17,360
do not produce anything. They are creating a new kind of rent which sucks the economic energy

218
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,280
out of the capital sector which is now becoming a vessel to their own cloud-based empire.

219
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,720
I think that's a different story. Let's talk about those technological advancements then.

220
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,320
Specifically, which ones you think were integral to cloud capital first emerging and also

221
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,760
where they came from? Where are they based? Where do these technological advancements start?

222
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,240
They start with the development of algorithms that could actually improve themselves.

223
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:54,000
When I was a student ages ago, algorithms were dumb. They were like recipes. You take this

224
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,760
ingredient, that ingredient, you mix them together, then if this happens then you do that, if the

225
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:07,920
other happens then you do something else. That's how programs learned how to produce good statistics,

226
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,920
solve mathematical problems, create Excel. These were dumb algorithms.

227
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,760
The moment you have reinforced learning in algorithms, so you have algorithms that do not have

228
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:32,400
set objectives. They have a variety of objectives that the algorithm can select from. It's a little

229
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:43,760
like telling a chef, prepare a dish of meat lasagna. But the same thing, if in the process

230
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,520
you realize that the quality of the meat is not what it should be, you can change your objective.

231
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,520
And then going beyond that, algorithms that could monitor their own efficiency and could

232
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,640
change, alter their own functioning in order to become more efficient. That's the beginning of

233
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:12,640
artificial intelligence. And of course now with generative learning and large language models,

234
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:24,720
at some point, this Hegelian dialectical idea, quantitative changes led to qualitative changes

235
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,960
in the same way that when you lose your hair, which hair must you lose before you declare bold?

236
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,000
There's no answer to that. But there is a point when at some point people say, oh, you're bolder,

237
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:44,880
right? Speaking from experience. Similarly, at some point, I can't pinpoint precisely when

238
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,240
the development of algorithms and their capacity to improve themselves and learn from themselves

239
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,200
and alter their own substance. At some point, this was a singularity. Not that they became

240
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,560
sentient. They never did. And I don't believe they ever will. But okay, this is science fiction.

241
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:14,480
At some point, they managed to acquire this capacity to do that which Cloud Capital does

242
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,680
in my book. And I think what's important as well, and you point out in the book,

243
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:24,000
is that the consequences that technical feudalism isn't actually inevitable

244
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,280
as a result of those technological advancements, that the political and social conditions

245
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,680
were absolutely crucial. Yes. So what are those social and political conditions?

246
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:39,200
Two. The first one was the privatization of the internet. Because internet one, the first

247
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,800
internet that came out of the military industrial complex in the United States, the Pentagon,

248
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,760
when they brought in research scientists from the universities and all sorts of enthusiasts,

249
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,480
coders, to contribute to the creation of the original internet, it was a commons.

250
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:04,960
It had nothing to do with capitalism. So to this day, when you read a website, you use this

251
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,480
HTTP ancient language, computer language, right? But that's somebody created that,

252
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,880
which allows us to read websites. That person didn't get a penny for it. It was a contribution

253
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,640
to the commons, to the internet commons. Similarly, with the various ancient technologies

254
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,080
still used to send and receive emails, SMTP and so on, you may have seen those. Those were all

255
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,120
protocols created by enthusiasts who were rewarded in a variety of ways, but not monetized.

256
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,400
So the first internet, I remember it, I was using the internet before it was called the internet,

257
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,880
it was called Janet. Do you know that? Joint academic network before it was called the internet,

258
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,000
at least in this country, it was called Janet. What were you using it for?

259
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:02,000
Well, initially, to exchange data with other academic researchers. And emails were called

260
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:09,040
batch files, because you would create a little batch of messages and put them into a file. And

261
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:16,320
that file would then be readable in America by some colleague there. But it was a commons. It

262
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,760
was like the commons before the enclosures. So we had a new enclosures with Big Tech after 2001.

263
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:33,840
And the most important development there is that they owned and privatized your identity. You cannot

264
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,520
prove who you are on the internet today. You've got subcontractor identity from large corporations.

265
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:51,040
So a bank knows who you are, right? So it can vouch on the internet through codes that it shares

266
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:58,880
with Google or Apple, because how does Apple know that it's you? It asks you to input your data from

267
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,760
your credit card or your debit card, so they take it from the bank. So Wall Street and Big Tech

268
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:11,760
and the City of London together own your identity. You have to pay to use your own identity.

269
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,400
That's the privatization of not just the commons, but of yourself, of the individual.

270
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,040
To this day, there's no way you can say it's me. Here's proof that it's me. The state could have

271
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:31,040
done that. The state could have certified who you are and given you a long number, which is you

272
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,120
and a pin number to certify that, but the state doesn't do that. It leaves it to the private

273
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:43,600
sector, to the concomitants. So that's one. The second development, which created techno feudalism,

274
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:52,720
that spawned huge quantities and qualities of cloud capital, was the response by our governments

275
00:29:52,720 --> 00:30:00,080
and central banks to the 2008 crisis, because after April 2009, I don't know if you do remember

276
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:05,120
that there was this meeting here in London presided over by Gordon Brown of the G7,

277
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,280
essentially decided to refloat finance, to bail out the bankers worldwide, and they printed

278
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:24,240
together over 13 years, $35 trillion, and they gave you the finances. At the same time, the

279
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,520
practice of austerity here in Britain, in Greece, across the European Union, in the United States,

280
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,720
austerity for the many, and socialism for the financiers. Now, why is this connected to cloud

281
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,320
capital? Because when you create all this amount, huge quantity of money, which circulates,

282
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,400
sloshes around the circuits of finance, but people are there, have no money because of austerity,

283
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,960
and they can't buy anything. Industrialists, the captains of industry and so on,

284
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,240
take Volkswagen for instance, right, or General Motors, they look at the little people and say,

285
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,320
as if they can afford to buy something like Google and Tesla. We're not going to invest in it.

286
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,120
We're not going to mass produce goods that these people won't be able to buy,

287
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,720
but they have all this money because the central banks have printed it and given it to the

288
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,960
financiers. The financiers want to give it to these industrialists, so the industrialists think

289
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,240
Apple has $200 billion, $200 billion of savings. Now, why do they want money from the central bank

290
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,560
if they have savings? They don't, but the central bank picks up the phone and says,

291
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,720
I'm going to give it to you for free. So, Apple says, all right, give it to them, and you know what

292
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,640
they do? They go to the stock exchange and buy Apple shares. The share price goes up,

293
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,160
their bonuses are linked to the share price, they're taking more money.

294
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:55,120
Mr. Cook and the rest, Steve Jobs before, the only ones who took this money and invested it

295
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:03,840
were the ones who invested in cloud capital, the Jeff Bezos and so on. There is no doubt that

296
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,960
all the money that has gone into creating the optic fiber cables criss-crossing the oceans,

297
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,000
the server farms, the algorithms, the AI and so on,

298
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:24,640
nine out of ten dollars or pounds spent on that came from the huge quantities of money

299
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:34,240
printed by the central banks, by the states. So, the awful response by our governments

300
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:43,440
to the 2008 disaster was part and parcel of what created the UMPH, the funding for the cloud

301
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,480
capital that now is taking over the world. It's interesting, actually, we had Mariano

302
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,320
Mazzucato in here recently talking about the state's role, I'm sure you know the book,

303
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,320
The Entrepreneurial State, right, and the state's role often in being the first mover for a lot

304
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,640
of this stuff, socializing the risk, accepting the risk of, let's say, creating the technology we

305
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,040
needed to put a man on the moon. But then, at the end, it's the private company who reaps the

306
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,800
rewards, it's the private company who takes the profits and the risk is socialized, the

307
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,520
profits are privatized. I wonder what you're reading on the states in quotes, not the United

308
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:23,200
States, I mean, a nation state's role is in establishing technofutilism and whether or not

309
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,160
you view that relationship between the likes of a musk, a Bezos, as a parasitic one, that they are

310
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,840
sort of benefiting from the investment that a state has made in the past.

311
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:42,960
Look, Mariano's thesis is absolutely correct. For decades, the military industrial complex,

312
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:52,400
the state has been central in investing and guiding the investing and having, you know,

313
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:02,480
good civil servants. I'll use a term of abuse or phrase that neoliberals use to abuse the state,

314
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,960
picking winners and decided that they're going to build the internet. The internet was not,

315
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,000
didn't spontaneously emerge. It was a decision of some people in the Pentagon to create the

316
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,520
internet for military purposes, but nevertheless, it did not come out of the marketplace.

317
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,040
And then the state comes in and invests. Every technology in your iPhone or your Samsung phone

318
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:32,400
or whatever was invented as a result of some government grant, which was directed in that Wi-Fi

319
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,560
came out of the CSIRO in Australia. What did the Australian government get for that? Zero,

320
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:46,720
because it was offered to the commons. Same with GPS. GPS was given for free. They could have

321
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,000
charged for it, but they gave it away for free. And then these companies that privatize the cloud,

322
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,720
privatize the internet, that's the Mariano Mazzucato story, then also privatize the returns

323
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:06,880
and use it in order to exert more power. And to deplete the capacity of the state to continue

324
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,640
doing that, which is like an idiot who sits on a branch of a tree and starts sowing the branch,

325
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,840
that I think is more or less the Mariano Mazzucato story. It's a good one, and I agree with that.

326
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:31,520
But as part of the same story comes my story, because by effectively emptying the state of content,

327
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,000
of, you know, deprofessionalizing the state, shifting everything to the private sector,

328
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:45,280
subcontracting everything to those conglomerates, the state created a much greater crisis in 2008

329
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:55,360
that would have happened had the state not done this. And then the private sector that was supposed

330
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:01,920
to know better, that's the neoliberal story, right, that the market knows best, collapsed under the

331
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,200
weight of its own stupidity and criminality. That was the case in 2008. And a hapless,

332
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,640
vacuous state, a state that doesn't have the expertise that it once had. This is the problem

333
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,440
we have today, you know. The state does not, why do you think the HS2 is not going to be built?

334
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,920
Because the state doesn't have any civil servants who know how to plan the construction of a major

335
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:32,800
project anymore. They've subcontracted everything. But still, they are responsible for saving capitalism

336
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,680
for itself in 2008, 2009, under Gordon Branson. So what do they do? They do the only thing they

337
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,640
know how to do, which is to print huge quantities of money and give it to the same people who

338
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:49,360
destroyed, nearly destroyed capitalism in 2008. And then what do they do? They give it away,

339
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,960
most people, most companies like Volkswagen and Ford and so on, go and buy back their own shares,

340
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,920
except for some really smart people like Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk and so on, who take the money,

341
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,680
and they are the only ones who invest. And I wouldn't call them parasites, you know.

342
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,800
I mean, I dislike all of them. But the person I consider a little must be an evil genius.

343
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,920
The emphasis on the genius, though, he's absolutely, spectacularly smart in the way that

344
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:26,240
SpaceX. He beat NASA on its own game. He actually created spaceships that can actually land

345
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:34,240
on their bottom, right, without being destroyed. You know, that's not to be scoffed at. So these people

346
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,240
created capital goods, what I call cloud capital, which is wonderful that we have it. I mean, I'm

347
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,360
all in favor of artificial intelligence. You know, when I spent the summer translating this book

348
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:54,720
using depot, and of course, working on top of it, I loved it. You know, I'm addicted to my phone

349
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,680
and to Google and to all those things. No, Facebook, I hate them, but that's my problem.

350
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,480
I use Twitter all the time, even though it's like, who put it that way? I can't remember.

351
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,120
You said it magnificently. It's like taking everything that's written on the walls of

352
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:16,000
mail toilets all over the world and putting it online. But nevertheless, you know, when I want

353
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
to publicize my book, I use Twitter when I want to have a political fight with somebody,

354
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,480
have it over Twitter. I'm not saying that they are useless. I'm not saying that they are parasitical.

355
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,320
What I'm saying is that the form of capital, which is creating a new socioeconomic order,

356
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,600
which is not viable, and it's not the fault of the machinery. It is not the fault of the technologies.

357
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:43,680
It is who owns them. But that is a Marxist critique of capitalism to begin with. The problem is not

358
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,160
the machine. The problem is who owns the machines and who doesn't have access to them unless they

359
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:54,960
provide free labor or very cheap labor in the case of capitalism, free labor in the case of

360
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,920
techno feudalism. Let's talk about that order a little bit more then. We've named the individuals

361
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,000
that sort of the cloud lists the people that could be said to form our new ruling class.

362
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,760
Let's talk, could you talk a little bit more, I should say, about how their rise and their supremacy

363
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,600
then places people like you and me as serfs in that system, how that dynamic works?

364
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:30,160
The moment they can create a cloud thief, which attracts us, because let's face it,

365
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:38,800
if I want to buy a book quickly, which I can't find on bookshop.co.uk, I'll go to Amazon

366
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,000
especially if I need to read something quickly and get it on Kindle. I go to the page, the relevant

367
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:51,040
page, if I'm writing an op-ed for the newspaper, I do it. So they create a cloud thief, which you

368
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:58,800
really need and want to be on. Once you're on it, you are helping without realizing it, reproduce

369
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:06,000
its capital stock, the capital stock that gives it power over you. So you are a serf without knowing

370
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,520
it, a voluntary serf, but of course the worst slavery is the one that people volunteer for.

371
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:27,200
Jeff Bezos then can use the attractiveness of this cloud thief essentially to siphon off the

372
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:35,520
capitalist sector, most of the profits, because when you chance 40% rent for anything sold on

373
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:42,960
your cloud thief, then essentially you decimate the profit basis of the capitalist. So the capitalist,

374
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,000
the standard capitalist, the old-fashioned capitalist, becomes a vessel to the cloud

375
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,520
capitalist or cloud-alist, I'll call them cloud-alists for short. We are cloud serfs to them.

376
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,640
In the Amazon warehouse, the people who work there as precarious, they don't have any rights

377
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:13,040
really, they're precarious labor, nomad land. Watch the movie if you haven't, you see what I mean.

378
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,080
They have electronic devices strapped to the wrist, which monitor their every move, tell them

379
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:33,120
which part of the warehouse to go to next, what box to pick up. So they are cloud trolls.

380
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:41,520
I mean, if you've seen the wonderful movie Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin, what he depicts there

381
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,400
is now full-on through the cloud, because it's the same cloud capital that connects

382
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:57,200
Alexa on your desktop, your laptop which creates cloud capital or recreates the cloud capital

383
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:07,200
of Amazon.com, the software that drives proletarians or precariously employed workers in the warehouse,

384
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,840
the drivers who are delivering the stuff. This is all a new form of

385
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:22,320
mutant capital, which I call cloud capital, which also puts the lid on the profitability

386
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:26,800
of the capitalist class, which means that because these people never pay tax,

387
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:33,520
that states will always be impoverished, states will then have to increase VAT,

388
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,520
which is the most regressive tax. So, you know, it's the plot thickens. It becomes a completely

389
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,720
different kind of system. One could call it rentier capital capitalism or platform capitalism,

390
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:56,160
but I insist on shifting away from the word capitalism, because it will help us concentrate

391
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,840
our mind on what the gigantic transformation is, the equivalent of moving from feudalism to

392
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:07,440
capitalism. Do you think we'll ever be able to tax them effectively? No. Why? Well, because they're

393
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,960
too smart and they have better accountants than the government has, and they can shift from one

394
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:24,800
country to another. And it is impossible to create the state power, or recreate the state power,

395
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:35,360
against their own cloudless power, to defeat them legally in terms of accounting, in terms of how

396
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,240
they managed to push their profits from one jurisdiction to the other until it lands in

397
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:49,040
some jurisdiction where no corporate tax is being levied. If we're going to defeat them,

398
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,280
and if we're going to turn this into a viable society, the global society, we must forget

399
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,560
about taxing them. We must think in old Marxist terms, how do we take their cloud capital away

400
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:10,640
from them? And how do we socialize it? So it's easier to imagine the end of the private property

401
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,840
of cloud capital than it is to imagine the proper taxation of cloud rents. Well, go on to that in a

402
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:24,480
moment. We'll talk about viable alternatives. What a more progressive, call it a utopia future,

403
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,920
whatever you like, looks like. However, is there, do you find it compelling to suggest,

404
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:35,200
I sit here in this conversation with you and I go, Janice, you know what? I don't want anything to

405
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,640
do with this. I'm getting rid of my phone. I'm getting rid of my laptop and I'm going to go and

406
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,480
live in a cabin in the woods and grow my own vegetables. Forget about it. See you later. I

407
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:47,680
don't want to engage. How do you answer that criticism? How do you try and compel people to

408
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,440
not go, God, this is the power, the wealth of the forces we're up against is so significant

409
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,720
that I just don't have the appetite to try and combat it? There aren't enough good and huts for

410
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:04,880
all of us to do that. And I don't believe you will do it. You may claim, you may feel desperate

411
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,360
and you may think that this is a lost cause and you may say that, oh, I'm going to do that,

412
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:14,080
but you're not going to do it. Even if you do it, you know, two months later, you'll come back,

413
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:22,160
you will crawl back into London using your phone again. So, you know, an escape to a

414
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:31,200
eucolic past that never really existed is not the solution. Is it possible though to opt out?

415
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,680
Maybe not in the way I've just described, but you know, you talked earlier about the way these

416
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:40,000
companies co-opt or identities. Is it possible for us to opt out of that process? Is it possible

417
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,800
for us to steal back what belongs to us? It's like saying, is it possible for somebody who comes from

418
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:52,240
rags to end up with riches? The answer is yes, but only if it's one person or a handful of persons.

419
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:57,760
A handful of persons could rise from rags to riches. They can go from being, you know,

420
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:04,000
Amazon warehouse workers to being cloudless. No doubt. No doubt. There is this degree of

421
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,760
social mobility, but it is impossible for society to escape as a society from techno feudalism.

422
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,440
You mentioned at the beginning the geopolitics or the conflict Cold War,

423
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,560
whatever you like, between the United States and China, and that it's wrong to understand that conflict

424
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,360
as a sort of traditional geopolitical game, but instead as a conflict between two

425
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,960
superpower cloud fiefs. So, please, can you talk about that a little bit more? And I guess I'd

426
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:41,680
ask you, glibly, as well, who's winning that war? Okay. Before I answer the second part, let me

427
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:49,680
explain what I mean. The rise of China is an American story in the same way that the creation

428
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,760
of the European Union is an American project. We Europeans like to think that we had a fantastic

429
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,680
idea to end the war in Europe. We had that idea, but the EU would never have been great without

430
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:09,200
Americans planning and executing the plan for the creation of the EU. Similarly, the rise of

431
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:15,120
China, okay, thanks to being played an important role by opening up, but what happened essentially

432
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,360
was this. There was a dark deal, I call it in the book, between the United States

433
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
ruling class and the Chinese Communist Party.

434
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:33,280
Industry would shift from the United States manufacturing to China.

435
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:41,280
China would be the Chinese capitalists would be exporting to the United States.

436
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,200
They would be getting paid in dollars that the United States would have to print

437
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,480
because the United States was a deficit country, remains a deficit country,

438
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:59,200
but that deficit would be sustainable. Why? Because all the profits, the dollar profits,

439
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,400
or the vast majority of the dollar profits of the Chinese capitalist would go to Wall Street

440
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:13,760
and be invested in real estate, in shares, in derivatives, and in bonds. In other words,

441
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,400
a large part of the Chinese profits from selling to the United States would be financing the American

442
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:25,680
government. That's a synergy. They are accomplices. The Chinese Communist Party and the American

443
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:35,920
rentier capitalist are partners. So why are they now moving apart and threatening the world with

444
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:45,360
Armageddon with a new Cold War that may end up into a thermonuclear war? That question was in my

445
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:51,520
mind for a very long time and I didn't have an answer to it until I noticed WeChat.

446
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,280
WeChat is an application that belongs to Tencent, a conglomerate, a big tech

447
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,520
megalith in China. I realized that the West doesn't have anything like that. Imagine

448
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:14,640
if there was an app, and by the way, that's what Elon Musk wants to do when he calls an

449
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:20,080
everything app. That's WeChat. Imagine there is an app that allows you to send messages,

450
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:28,640
watch TikTok-like videos, watch movies, listen to music, everything that's Spotify,

451
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,640
Netflix, Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal, and so on do. Everything in one app plus

452
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:44,240
free payments. You don't have that now here. You need to download the application of Lloyds Bank,

453
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:49,760
of Barclays Bank, of Bank of America, and so on. They charge you an arm and a leg to make payments

454
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:58,320
or they charge proprietors, shops, shopkeepers, an arm and a leg, Apple Pay. They charge huge rents

455
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:05,920
for making these transactions. WeChat, free payments and you can have any WeChat app.

456
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:16,080
All you need is a bank account somewhere in China, in one. So suddenly, this amazing deal

457
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:23,120
that the United States had with China, but also with the European Union, a little aside,

458
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,560
when the euro came out, everybody was saying, oh, this is great because we Europeans will be able

459
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:33,120
to compete with the dollar, the exorbitant privilege of the dollar, the supremacy of the dollar is

460
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,120
going to be challenged by the euro. That never happened and never will happen. Why? Because

461
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:42,560
if you're a German industrialist, if you, you know, Mercedes Benz or a Dutch industrialist,

462
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:50,320
you don't want the euro to usurp the power of the dollar because your money, most of your

463
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:56,640
profits come from selling to the Americans. Now the Americans are a deficit country. The only

464
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:02,320
reason why you sell to them is because they have the state deficit, which they cover with dollars,

465
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,240
and the only reason why you accept dollars is because of the exorbitant privilege of the dollar.

466
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:13,520
So you don't want the euro to undermine the power of the dollar as a European capitalist.

467
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,320
The greatest strength of the American dollar is foreign capitalists, not the CIA, not the American

468
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:26,880
military, not Biden, none of these people. It is a foreign capitalist who freaks out at the thought

469
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,440
that the dollar will lose its authority and power. That applies to the Chinese

470
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,880
capitalists who do not want to see the one, the Chinese currency, overtake the American one.

471
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,320
But the Chinese, because they have, due to the power of the Chinese Communist Party,

472
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:50,480
fused their big tech with their big banks, something that's not happening in the United States,

473
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,880
Wall Street will never allow Silicon Valley to go anywhere near the payment system.

474
00:51:55,600 --> 00:52:03,440
So they are at loggerheads, Big Tech and Silicon Valley, sorry, Silicon Valley and Wall Street.

475
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,040
In China, they refuse the one thing. That's why you have a WeChat. Add to that the central bank

476
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:14,880
digital currency, which allows you and me, the foreigners as well, to have a digital wallet

477
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:23,120
in China with three transactions, in one, of course. Suddenly, the predominance of the dollar

478
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:30,480
comes into question. The Trump administration started the Cold War by freezing Huawei out.

479
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:35,680
In my estimation, it's because of that. Nothing to do with Huawei posing a national security

480
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,960
threat or anything like that. And then you have the war in Ukraine. And the confiscation of $400

481
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:49,680
billion, owned by the Russian Central Bank, by the West, primarily the United States.

482
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:53,280
I'm not going to start a conversation about whether they should have done that or not.

483
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:58,480
All I'm saying is that if you are a Saudi Arabian prince, an Indonesian oligarch,

484
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,120
and of course a Russian, but even a Ukrainian oligarch, you never know what happens after the war.

485
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:10,960
And you see that these Americans have no qualms confiscating your money, hundreds of billions

486
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:18,000
of dollars. Then you think twice before you put all your money in dollars. So this superhighway

487
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,600
of payments, of free payments that the Chinese have created, which they didn't even want to use

488
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:26,080
themselves because they want the American dollar because their capitalist profits come from the

489
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:34,000
American. Suddenly, it sees a lot of traffic. And Wall Street, they are shitting their pants.

490
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,760
Excuse my French. It's welcome because they think, oh my God, here we have an alternative to the

491
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:47,760
dollar system. I think this is what's underpinning the New Cold War. When Biden announced that

492
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:55,200
essentially what he told the Chinese in the fall of 2021 was, we will prevent you from becoming

493
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:00,560
in a technological advanced country. When you ban the sale of advanced chips, chips to a country

494
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:07,280
like China, you're saying you will stay technologically backwards. Well, that's a declaration of war.

495
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:15,600
A technological war, but economic war. So they start decoupling themselves and they start

496
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:23,920
putting more emphasis on this alternative payment system. So it's a clash of two cloud fiefs,

497
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:31,840
two cloud techno feudalisms, a clash between two payment systems, both of them digital,

498
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:37,360
both of them living on the cloud. One dollar denominated, the other one denominated. And where

499
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:43,680
is Britain? Where is the European Union? Nowhere. We are utterly insignificant.

500
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,080
It's a reassuring place to be, isn't it? So I don't mind being insignificant. It's just that,

501
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:55,520
you know, our politicians have not gotten onto that. What's actually happening? Yeah, they keep

502
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:02,160
thinking up and making Britain great again, the European Union that is going to become a

503
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:09,600
significant force if we integrate more and we have more countries in the Balkans and Ukraine and so

504
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:18,320
rubbish. We are nobodies. It is China on the one hand with the coalescence of the bricks around it

505
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,000
and the United States on the other hand. That's a very unstable world to live in and doesn't

506
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,800
augur very well for the European continent, including Britain. Could you talk a little bit about

507
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:36,000
how cryptocurrency fits into that network? Because I assume on the one hand this possibly

508
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:42,400
democratised, direct, discreet system for financial transactions essentially threatens

509
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,120
the stability and the supremacy of those two payment systems you just mentioned, though.

510
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:54,640
I think that crypto is overblown. It's macroeconomically and sociologically insignificant.

511
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,480
It is technically fascinating when the algorithm for Bitcoin came out

512
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,920
by Nakamoto or somebody called Nakamoto in 2008. I spent quite a few months studying it.

513
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,240
I was fascinated by the technology and why the magazine interviewed me back then.

514
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,080
What did I think of it? And I said it's a fantastic solution to a problem we have not discovered yet.

515
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,120
It's not money and it can never be money. And I explained in the book why it can never be money.

516
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,320
It can be a speculative asset, which is what it is. I mean nobody uses Bitcoin to buy stuff.

517
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:35,920
And it would be crazy to use it to buy stuff if you think about it because imagine that I mean

518
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,880
to begin with Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It has to have a fixed supply in order to have value.

519
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,520
But at the moment, lots of people use it to buy things.

520
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:53,360
And more people come in, demand for Bitcoin increases. So its dollar value or pound value rises.

521
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:58,400
At some point, when it exceeds a certain point, if it starts working as a function, as a currency,

522
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:03,360
then people are better off using pounds again and keeping holding their Bitcoin.

523
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,480
So there is a plateau. There is an inbuilt

524
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,400
ceiling, which does not prevent Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency from functioning

525
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,680
like a means of exchange. So then it becomes a speculative thing. And then you have an oligarchy

526
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:28,720
of those early adopters who are sitting on very valuable piles, stashes of Bitcoins.

527
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:35,920
So I don't find it interesting. I find the blockchain technology very interesting.

528
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:42,160
And in my previous book, Another Now, which was a political science fiction novel,

529
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:49,840
where I imagine Another Now, how could things have developed today in a socialist world

530
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:57,040
after 2008? How would things work? Blockchain is part of the deal. But it is not a way out

531
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:02,640
of capitalism or techno-fidelism. It is a technology that we will use once we are free

532
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:09,680
of the yoke of capital. You addressed the book to your father, who hoped that a capitalist order

533
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:15,840
would be replaced by a socialist utopia for the benefit of society. And one of the striking

534
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:19,520
things, well, I wanted to ask you, I was about to ask you, you're almost interviewing yourself,

535
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,480
about Another Now, because obviously it was one of the things in socialism, right?

536
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,320
There are very few blueprints out there about what the future society could look like, and that is

537
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:33,360
provided in Another Now. You have described it, you have just literally described it as science

538
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:39,440
fiction. So I don't know how valid it is as a comparison to techno-fidelism and as an alternative.

539
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,520
But you mentioned democratised company and democratised money. And I wonder if you do

540
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,600
think those are viable alternatives to the reality that you're describing in this book.

541
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,480
They are the only viable models, because What We Have Now is not viable. It's real,

542
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:04,960
but it's not sustainable. The economic crisis we are facing, and which we will continue to face,

543
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:10,960
have to do with the fact that value is created in a tiny sector of the economy, which is shrinking,

544
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:16,400
the capitalist sector of the economy. That's where value is produced by wage labor, but that is

545
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:25,360
shrinking. We have an increasing domain of free labor, of cloud service, of cloud capital,

546
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:33,440
of the platforms, which are parasitic to a shrinking capitalist base. So our crisis,

547
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,680
financial crisis, economic crisis, cost of living crisis are going to be getting worse and worse

548
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:44,480
and worse, just like the climate crisis. So this is not a viable system. It's a system we live in,

549
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,120
but we are stampeding towards oblivion, both socially and environmentally.

550
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,000
So the reason why I wrote Another Now, by the way, science fiction is not about any fairy

551
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,360
stuff. Science fiction is not about the future. Science fiction is an innovative way of writing

552
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:09,040
about the past and the present. That's why I always loved science fiction. So as a socialist

553
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:15,440
and a politician, I always have to answer the guy in the pub or the last in the pub who says to me,

554
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:20,080
okay, mate, if you don't like the way things are, how should they be? And that's a difficult question,

555
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,920
and I didn't have an answer to that. That's why I sat down and I wrote that novel, which was about,

556
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:30,880
you know, if our revolution occupied Wall Street and so on had succeeded in 2008, what could life

557
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:37,680
be like now, given the technologies we have and, you know, the fallen nature of humanity

558
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:46,720
that is a given, right? We are imperfect beings. So I tried to imagine what would corporate law

559
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:54,960
be like. So I advocate the idea of one worker, one employee, one share, one vote,

560
01:00:55,840 --> 01:00:59,600
which if you think about it, it's such an easy idea in the same way you have one vote

561
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:05,440
when you go to the polling stations, you have one vote as a worker, and you cannot buy votes,

562
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:10,400
you cannot lease votes, you cannot rent them, in the same way you can't in the political system.

563
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:17,120
So imagine that. Suddenly, without revolution, without having, you know, without storming

564
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:23,520
Backingham Palace or the Winter Palace or whatever, suddenly you have totally democratized

565
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:29,840
the world of work, and you have done away with the stock exchanges because if you can't sell and

566
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,800
buy shares, then it was a point of the stock exchange. And if you have the central bank,

567
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:38,480
the Bank of England, let's say, or the European Central Bank, giving each one of us

568
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:45,280
a free digital wallet with a pin number where we can park our money, then what's the point

569
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:51,280
of having an account with Lloyds? Barclays. You don't even need to be authoritarian and

570
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:58,160
ban them. They will just shrivel and die, unless they can provide you with services

571
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:03,600
that they are not providing you now. I mean, the only reason why you now have an account

572
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:10,480
with a private banker is because it's the only way of using your money. So another now was all

573
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:16,560
about being practical in a science fiction type of way in answering the question, how could things

574
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:26,000
be functioning today? Do you think we can get that? Well, I don't think I'm going to live to see it,

575
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,440
if that's what you're asking. Mind you, I'm getting old anyway, so that doesn't matter.

576
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:38,480
So this is the bad news. The bad news is that I'm not optimistic. But I think that to be optimistic

577
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:43,920
today, you have to be a real fool given that there's no empirical evidence pointing to good

578
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:50,800
outcomes. But then again, imagine this being the 1770s. And I mentioned the 1770s because that was

579
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:57,200
the time when Adam Smith was writing his Wealth of Nations, which spearheaded, spearheaded, introduced

580
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:02,480
the world to the great transformation of the time from feudalism to capitalism. If I'm right that

581
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,280
today we're living in the same moment of transformation from capitalism to taking feudalism,

582
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,280
I think the 1770s is a good point in time to compare ourselves with. So imagine this was the

583
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:19,920
1770s and I was advocating a world without slavery. And you were interviewing me and you said,

584
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,680
do you think this is going to happen? I probably would say to you, no. I can't imagine, you know,

585
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:33,440
there had been no human society without slavery beforehand. So how could the human mind in the

586
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,920
1770s imagine a world where slavery was universally condemned and bound? So on the one hand,

587
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,440
totally pessimistic. On the other hand, absolutely hopeful. Good.

588
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,040
Mr. Farkees, thank you so much for coming in. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.
