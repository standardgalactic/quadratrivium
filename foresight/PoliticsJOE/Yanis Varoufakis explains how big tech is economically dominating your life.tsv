0	4240	Wall Street and Big Tech and the City of London together own your identity.
4240	7600	You have to pay to use your own identity.
7600	12960	If we are going to defeat them, and if we're going to turn this into a viable society,
12960	18480	the global society, we must forget about taxing, we must think in old Marxist terms,
18480	20960	how do we take their capital away from them?
20960	23440	This is not a viable system, it's a system we live in.
23440	26720	We are stampeding towards oblivion.
26720	28160	Janis Varivakis, hello, how are you?
28800	29680	Very well.
29680	30000	Good.
30000	31120	I'm very happy to be here.
31120	32080	Very happy to have you here.
32800	36400	Before we get into the subject matter today, your book, Technofutilism,
37360	41360	I'd invite you to tell the audience who you are, what you do, in your own words.
42160	46720	Well, I used to be an academic that no one knew anything about because I was
48560	56400	cocooned in my university office writing esoteric texts that maximum 20 people around
56400	62400	the world cared for, and I didn't mind, until I started feeling in the early 2000s that the world
62400	71280	is heading towards another 1929 discontinuity, let's put it mildly, and at that moment I thought that
71280	76480	I don't have the right, the moral right to carry on playing around with my mathematical
76480	83920	models of game theory, and I started writing fiery articles and books, including the Global
83920	89840	Minotaur, which became quite a significant text, even if I'm saying so myself, regardless of 2008.
92320	98080	It was a time when I was also shifting from Australia to my home country, Greece, which was
98080	108160	always going to be ground zero of the European great financial crisis, and at some point
108400	116880	having opened my mouth once too often and written too many articles about it, a young man who was
116880	124960	leading the Greek opposition at the time, this is now 2010, 11, 12, 13, at some point invited me
124960	135040	to become the finance minister if he were to win, which I did, and so from obscure mathematical
135040	141440	texts I was elevated to becoming the finance minister of the most bankrupt state in Europe,
141440	148720	the world, that lasted five, six months because we had a pact, the prime minister and myself,
148720	155840	that we would never accept another bailout loan under conditions of crashing 80% of the population,
156400	164160	he decided that he wanted to surrender, I decided I'm not going to surrender, and that's it, I resigned,
164160	171920	and then created my own party, going from small victory to grand failure, writing books all the
171920	178160	time as therapy, so that's why. Okay, perfect, let's indulge them in another hour of therapy,
178160	183040	talking about this book, we're going to get into the concepts in it, we're going to go into it in
183040	188960	detail, but top line for people who are just here to begin with, what's it about, why is it important,
188960	197920	why should people read it? We all feel in our bones that this crisis is never ending, it is
197920	202160	metamorphosizing, taking different, you know, from a crisis of deflation, falling prices and
202160	209440	falling wages, it went to a crisis of the cost of living crisis, of inflation, we know that there's
209440	217040	something dismally wrong with the world, that you know capitalism was always a system that produced
217120	225280	crisis, and new funding forms of poverty and depravity, but what has been happening over the last
225280	235200	15 years, excuse me, is unique, we haven't experienced that since the 1770s, 1780s, this
236640	242000	so universal sense of angst that everybody shares, including of course about the climate,
242800	248640	and my view is that the reason why we're experiencing this is not that capitalism is going through
248640	255760	another one of its normal crisis, but rather we are at a turning point, very much like the 1770s,
255760	263520	1780s, when there was a great transformation, as Karl Polanyi put it, from feudalism to capitalism,
263520	270240	and the feudalism power sprang out of the land, anybody who owned land, the land of Gentry,
270240	276640	had power, and it was all sorts of power packed in one, political power, economic power,
277360	283920	cultural power, if you were the aristocracy or part of it, you had it, and you couldn't
283920	291120	distinguish between political and economic power, and the wealth came out of rent, the rents that
291120	298880	the aristocrats of the land of Gentry charged, vassals and peasants and so on, and then there is
298880	307600	this great shift from land to machinery to capital, and from rent to profit through the
307600	314320	commodification of land, the commodification of labor, even though peasants worked very hard,
314320	319440	their labor was not a commodity, they couldn't quit, didn't receive a wage, it was no labor market,
319440	323440	similarly for land, there was no market for land, you either had it or you didn't have it,
324240	329200	and then everything was commodified, so that was capitalism, it starts here in this country
329200	334080	and in Amsterdam around the end of the 18th century, and it continues to this day.
334880	342400	Now, I mentioned before that it was in the 2000s that I was feeling that some major crisis was
342400	351920	coming, and 2008, the city of London, Wall Street, so on, in my estimation, created a rupture in
351920	357600	capitalism, it wasn't anything like, not even like 1929, it was even more substantial than that,
358640	362080	and for a number of years I was trying to think about what on earth is happening,
362960	369520	and I came to the very controversial conclusion, which is this book, that in the same way that
369520	374480	we shifted from feudalism to capitalism, we are now shifting, without realizing it, to a new form
374480	378640	of feudalism, a very advanced, almost science fiction form of feudalism, this is why I call it
378720	387040	techno feudalism, but essentially, we have a new land, which is the cloud, and we have a new landed
387040	393120	gentry, you can call them cloud delists, or the techno feudal lords, the lords of the cloud,
393120	400880	like Jeff Bezos, just one example of Zuckerberg, and power is shifting from the owners of machinery,
400880	406160	of standard machines, even industrial robots, even advanced machinery, to the owners of this
406160	414400	network of machines that creates this digital version of land, and just one last point to explain
414400	421040	to our audience what I mean by that, when you enter Amazon.com, or Alibaba, or one of those
421040	425040	digital platforms, people think that they enter a marketplace, they do not enter a marketplace,
425040	430720	they enter a digital fiefdom, because come to think of it, even though you buy yourself,
431600	437120	it's all mediated by an algorithm that belongs to one person, who doesn't produce anything,
438000	446080	except for this landscape. And how does Bezos make his billions? If you produce a book, or, you know,
447200	454400	a bicycle, or anything that you sell through Amazon.com, he keeps 40%, that's a rent. Suddenly,
454400	460960	we've gone from profits to rents, but this time, it's not rents that you charge for the use, or the
460960	466720	leasing of land, but the leasing of the clouds, so I call them cloud rents. And the more I thought
466720	473200	about that, the more I convinced myself that this is a great transformation, which is hugely important,
473200	482000	not theoretically, but for me, the idea of the liberal individual gone. You can no longer be
482640	488400	a genuine liberal, or even a libertarian, if I'm right. Social democracy gone, because what was
488400	493760	social democracy? It was a kind of mediation between industrial capital and organized liberal
493760	501520	gone, because industrial capital now is being exploited by those people. They get 40% of whatever
501520	507440	it is that they produce, and no one is going to negotiate with Jeff Bezos. No government can make
508160	514320	any group of workers sit down with Jeff Bezos, or they can't make Jeff Bezos sit down with any
514320	519600	group of workers and carry out a social democratic bargain, or new deal, or whatever.
520320	524880	And also, if you look at the clash between the United States and China, why is this happening?
526080	532480	Taiwan is not the reason. Taiwan was always a problem. National security is not the reason.
532480	541360	My view is that what you have is two kinds, two cloud fiefdoms clashing. The American one,
541360	547280	based on Silicon Valley and Wall Street, and the Chinese one. Europe is non-existent,
547280	553360	because we don't have a cloud. So anyway, that's the whole story, really.
553360	555440	And we'll drill down their details in the book.
555440	560160	Perfect. And we'll get into those details over the course of this conversation. Before we do get
560160	565200	on to that subject matter, I'd like to loiter around this point about the end of capitalism,
565200	570480	about what's killing capitalism, and whether or not you mentioned 2008, 2009. Is it fair to say
570480	574240	whether actually capital is the force that's causing capitalism to come to an end at the moment?
574240	580480	That's a great irony. I'm a Marxist, I'm a left-winger, full disclosure folks.
581760	584560	And I remain a Marxist. And I think that this is a Marxist analysis.
584960	589120	I mean, there's even an appendix with a Marxist political economy take for
589680	594240	nerds. If you're a nerd Marxist and you want to look at what is the actual political,
594240	598320	Marxist political economy behind this book, there's an appendix. You don't have to read it,
598320	602400	but it's there for you to tell people that you read it.
602400	603360	Yeah, of course.
605600	612720	So I'm saying this because we of the left always imagined that we were brought to this earth
612720	620080	by chance and nature and whatever, in order to overthrow capitalism. That capitalism will be
620080	627120	overthrown by the organized left, by the organized labor unions. Didn't happen, we failed. We are
627120	631680	dismal abysmal failures. No doubt about that, right? All of us. Yep.
634880	640000	So what did the trick? Capital. Capital went through a historic mutation
640960	646800	from a produced means of production. Because if you think about a fishing rod, a steam engine,
646800	652720	an industrial robot, it's something we have produced in order to produce all this stuff.
652720	660800	It's a produced means of production. But cloud capital is a produced means of behavior modification.
662000	667920	That's very different. So effectively, you've taken the, if you remember Mad Men, the wonderful
667920	672720	television series and Don Draper, right? So you automate Don Draper. You turn him into Alexa.
674160	678640	And he does much more than simply put ideas into your mind as to what you want. Firstly,
679200	686320	it trains you to train it, to train you to train it, to input into your mind preferences.
687360	689840	And at the same time, the moment you have that preference for something,
690480	694000	that need for some good, it sells it to you by passing all markets.
694080	699440	In that sense, capital has over the capitalism.
700960	706160	So talk about this Amazon Alexa example a little bit more, because this cloud capital
706160	712160	idea is what underpins techno feudalism, right? How does it differ from traditional capital?
712160	718480	You covered it just a little bit. And also, how does it turn us, the user, if you like,
718480	721120	into the serfs of feudalism past?
722880	730560	Advertisers have always been in the business of indoctrinating us, right? Of putting ideas,
730560	737280	of manufacturing desires in our soul. This is the major transformation, transition
737280	742000	from early capitalism to more advanced monopoly capitalism after the Second World War.
742880	748400	In the 19th century, the capitalism that Adam Smith was talking about was all about producing
748480	757040	bread and, you know, ale and meat and carriages and horse manure and stuff, things that people
757040	762880	needed through a market-based mechanism for distributing productive resources.
765120	769840	And using the price mechanism in order to equilibrate demand and supply and all that.
769840	775200	That's before the war. After the war, you've got the big conglomerates in the United States,
775200	780960	primarily, that emerged from the war economy. They have this huge, immense productive capacity.
780960	786160	They can produce a lot more washing machines that American families wanted. So they had to find
786160	794560	markets outside. And they needed to manufacture desires in our soul for the things that they
794560	798160	could produce, because they could produce a lot more than what we needed. So they had to convince
798160	804320	us that we needed more than we needed. And that's von Draper. That's advertising, right?
804320	808640	But that was human beings. It was a new profession, the purpose of which was to convince you to buy
808640	817200	stuff. One way street. Don Draper comes up with an idea, wonderful poster on the motorway. You sit,
817200	823040	you say, I want that, then you go and buy it. Okay. Still a very significant change back in the 50s,
823040	833840	60s, 70s and so on. Today, what you have is Alexa sitting on your desk or Siri on your phone
833840	842800	or Google Assistant, all those contraptions, which present themselves as your slaves. So you say, you
842800	855040	know, set the alarm clock for 1035, order milk, tell me a story, play music, stream a video,
855040	860880	all those things. So it's great. I mean, I'm addicted to all those machines, right? I'm not a
860880	868160	Luddite or a neo Luddite by any stage of the imagination. But that's not what Alexa is.
868880	874640	Alexa is an interface with cloud capital belonging to one man or to a few men, usually men.
877360	884960	And what you do is you give it information about yourself. So you train it so that it knows you.
885920	891680	And then it starts giving you recommendations about books to read, pieces of music to listen to,
891680	897360	films to watch, which are spore on. I don't know about you, but when Spotify recommends music,
897360	904160	it's usually music I like. When Amazon recommends books, it's always books I want to read. It knows
904160	910160	me, right? Which is very impressive. And we are impressionable people. So when Alexa recommends
910240	915120	something to me day after in day out that I want, at some point, when she recommends something else,
915120	921920	I will want it or I will at least buy it. And it will always be quite close, not exactly what I
921920	931680	would have selected without her, her of it, but quite close, right? So this is a two way street.
931680	936960	This is an infinite regress. I tell it things so that you can tell me things so I can tell
937120	945040	things and therefore it acquires a great deal of power over my thinking and my preferences
945040	951600	and my desires and my aspirations even. And the most important thing here is that it is the same
951600	957280	software, the same mechanism, not just software, warehousing and all that, that can actually send
957280	963600	it to me directly by passing any capitalist. The capitalist then becomes a vessel to that.
963600	971360	So this is what is so different to Don Draper. Don Draper could not sell you anything
971920	976640	himself. He could convince you to go into the shops and buy it. And one final thing.
978000	985440	There isn't why this cloud capital in my book and in my mind is very different to very advanced
985440	991280	pieces of technology like rockets or industrial robots, which are also very advanced contraptions.
991280	998640	But the great difference is that capital until now required waged labor to be created.
999360	1004240	So from the steam engines to the industrial robots today, there were workers, there are workers,
1004240	1010320	in factories, together with machines and other robots and other pieces of produced means of
1010320	1016160	production that actually build the stuff. So you need a capitalist who employs labor, machinery,
1017120	1023840	buildings, electricity, technology and so on to produce the capital, not Amazon.com,
1024400	1031200	not cloud capital. Most of cloud capital is produced by me and you because you know that very well
1031200	1040960	that why can't we compete with Elon Musk's former Twitter ex, even if you and I were great coders
1040960	1051040	and produced such a network, such a piece of software for short form debating, which is much
1051040	1057120	better than Twitter, even if we did. Who would join it? Yeah, all our followers are on Twitter.
1057680	1069840	Ex, I can't say it. So the capital of ex is us and all our tweets. Amazon.com, every time you
1069840	1076960	buy something or you like something or you upload a review of some book or some product,
1076960	1082960	you're adding to the capital stock. So we are creating the, you know, a large part of cloud
1082960	1089200	capital. So cloud capital is a new form of capital because of the way it reproduces itself.
1090080	1096480	It can reproduce itself using self labor by people who don't even know themselves. So that's why I
1096480	1101920	call them called us cloud serves because we do all this work. Even if we don't do anything,
1101920	1107440	just we have our phone on us and we're walking around London, Google Maps knows where we are
1107440	1114880	and that enriches its capacity. It's cloud capital for telling people where it's congested,
1114880	1120480	where they shouldn't go, whether, you know, this shop is a popular one or less popular one.
1121280	1130320	So capital that produces and that produces itself, that is a major discontinuity in the
1130320	1134400	development of our technologies and the socioeconomic system we live in.
1134400	1138240	We'll talk about this point in more detail in a moment, I think, because it's interesting that
1139120	1145440	Shoshana Zuboff in surveillance capitalism, she argues that those inputs, those behavioral
1145440	1149840	or activities that the companies then monetize, that it forms part of a new capitalist system,
1149840	1152960	it doesn't go as far as saying feudalism, but maybe we can talk about that in a moment.
1152960	1157840	But I just wanted to pick you up on, you referred to Alexa as she instead of it.
1160880	1166000	And I wonder, maybe you do, maybe you don't, maybe this question goes nowhere, what role
1166000	1172720	sort of the anthropomorphizing these technologies have of turning them into people,
1172720	1176160	of turning Alexa into a woman, of turning Syria where you can tell Syria to be, whoever you want
1176400	1181280	to be, but I wonder if you, whether you think that's significant or perhaps you don't, I don't know.
1181280	1187200	Of course it is significant. The greater the capacity of the machines to present themselves
1187200	1195680	as humans, the greater the power of this infinite regress where we're training to train us,
1195680	1200800	to train it, to train us and so on and so forth. Now you mentioned Zuboff and, you know,
1200880	1206320	an important book, Surveillance Capitalism, from which I've learned and which I think is an important
1207120	1212640	part of the story, but doesn't go far enough because it continues to treat those corporations
1212640	1219520	as monopoly capitalists. Now Henry Ford, Thomas Edison were monopoly capitalists.
1219520	1224560	They had created network companies. I mean Thomas Edison was the Elon Musk of his era.
1224560	1231360	Think about it. In the early years, the first decade, 1903, 1904,
1231360	1237600	he actually electrocuted a hapless elephant at Coney Island in order to demonstrate
1238720	1243680	that the electricity, the alternative current that he used which belonged to Westinghouse,
1243680	1250400	which was coming out of a Westinghouse powerhouse, was lethal because he was selling a direct
1250400	1257920	current which would not have killed the elephant or a human being. So concentrated power, huge
1257920	1265920	egos, new fungal technologies. This is all new and the capacity of those people, especially Henry
1265920	1273680	Ford, to monopolize markets through technological advancement and to create desires into people's
1273680	1280720	minds, desires they didn't know they had. This is not new. It's there. Of course, Big Tech has
1280720	1290320	turbocharged it and it is true that they have such direct access through Alexa and Siri and so on
1290320	1297840	and our phones really, our tablets, to us that that monopoly power, the capacity to monopolize
1297840	1305200	a market is now much greater than it was before the Second World War. However, where I go
1306400	1315840	further is that I'm making the point that Amazon.com and thousands of such companies now
1315840	1323040	all over the world, in Indonesia, in Malaysia, especially in Africa, this shift from the market
1323040	1332480	to digital platforms, these digital platforms are not markets and the, I mean, Ford, how did he
1332480	1338800	make his money? Selling cars. He made the cars and sold them to you. Now the owners of these platforms
1339680	1347360	of the cloud do not make anything. They are go-betweens. They are essentially renters
1348240	1353520	and you might say, well, why don't we call it an entire capitalism? Well, we could. In the same way
1353520	1359600	we could call capitalism industrial feudalism. It wouldn't be wrong, but it wouldn't allow our
1359600	1365360	minds to concentrate on the fact that here is a great transformation to another social system which
1366000	1372800	relies on rents, not on monopoly profits. That's the great difference with Ford, the great difference
1372880	1378640	with Hilton, the great difference with McDonald's. All those people actually produced goods and
1378640	1386320	services that they monopolized and convinced you you really needed them. Basis and the rest
1386960	1397360	do not produce anything. They are creating a new kind of rent which sucks the economic energy
1398000	1405280	out of the capital sector which is now becoming a vessel to their own cloud-based empire.
1405280	1408720	I think that's a different story. Let's talk about those technological advancements then.
1409840	1414320	Specifically, which ones you think were integral to cloud capital first emerging and also
1414960	1419760	where they came from? Where are they based? Where do these technological advancements start?
1420320	1424240	They start with the development of algorithms that could actually improve themselves.
1425200	1434000	When I was a student ages ago, algorithms were dumb. They were like recipes. You take this
1434000	1439760	ingredient, that ingredient, you mix them together, then if this happens then you do that, if the
1439760	1447920	other happens then you do something else. That's how programs learned how to produce good statistics,
1448880	1455920	solve mathematical problems, create Excel. These were dumb algorithms.
1457680	1463760	The moment you have reinforced learning in algorithms, so you have algorithms that do not have
1465040	1472400	set objectives. They have a variety of objectives that the algorithm can select from. It's a little
1472400	1483760	like telling a chef, prepare a dish of meat lasagna. But the same thing, if in the process
1483760	1489520	you realize that the quality of the meat is not what it should be, you can change your objective.
1490240	1497520	And then going beyond that, algorithms that could monitor their own efficiency and could
1497600	1504640	change, alter their own functioning in order to become more efficient. That's the beginning of
1504640	1512640	artificial intelligence. And of course now with generative learning and large language models,
1515600	1524720	at some point, this Hegelian dialectical idea, quantitative changes led to qualitative changes
1524720	1530960	in the same way that when you lose your hair, which hair must you lose before you declare bold?
1531520	1536000	There's no answer to that. But there is a point when at some point people say, oh, you're bolder,
1536000	1544880	right? Speaking from experience. Similarly, at some point, I can't pinpoint precisely when
1544880	1552240	the development of algorithms and their capacity to improve themselves and learn from themselves
1552240	1557200	and alter their own substance. At some point, this was a singularity. Not that they became
1558080	1564560	sentient. They never did. And I don't believe they ever will. But okay, this is science fiction.
1565520	1574480	At some point, they managed to acquire this capacity to do that which Cloud Capital does
1574480	1579680	in my book. And I think what's important as well, and you point out in the book,
1579680	1584000	is that the consequences that technical feudalism isn't actually inevitable
1584000	1587280	as a result of those technological advancements, that the political and social conditions
1587920	1591680	were absolutely crucial. Yes. So what are those social and political conditions?
1591680	1599200	Two. The first one was the privatization of the internet. Because internet one, the first
1599200	1604800	internet that came out of the military industrial complex in the United States, the Pentagon,
1605200	1611760	when they brought in research scientists from the universities and all sorts of enthusiasts,
1612320	1616480	coders, to contribute to the creation of the original internet, it was a commons.
1617360	1624960	It had nothing to do with capitalism. So to this day, when you read a website, you use this
1624960	1632480	HTTP ancient language, computer language, right? But that's somebody created that,
1632480	1638880	which allows us to read websites. That person didn't get a penny for it. It was a contribution
1638880	1644640	to the commons, to the internet commons. Similarly, with the various ancient technologies
1644640	1650080	still used to send and receive emails, SMTP and so on, you may have seen those. Those were all
1651200	1657120	protocols created by enthusiasts who were rewarded in a variety of ways, but not monetized.
1658080	1662400	So the first internet, I remember it, I was using the internet before it was called the internet,
1662400	1668880	it was called Janet. Do you know that? Joint academic network before it was called the internet,
1669520	1672000	at least in this country, it was called Janet. What were you using it for?
1673360	1682000	Well, initially, to exchange data with other academic researchers. And emails were called
1682000	1689040	batch files, because you would create a little batch of messages and put them into a file. And
1689040	1696320	that file would then be readable in America by some colleague there. But it was a commons. It
1696320	1701760	was like the commons before the enclosures. So we had a new enclosures with Big Tech after 2001.
1702720	1713840	And the most important development there is that they owned and privatized your identity. You cannot
1713840	1721520	prove who you are on the internet today. You've got subcontractor identity from large corporations.
1721520	1731040	So a bank knows who you are, right? So it can vouch on the internet through codes that it shares
1731040	1738880	with Google or Apple, because how does Apple know that it's you? It asks you to input your data from
1738880	1743760	your credit card or your debit card, so they take it from the bank. So Wall Street and Big Tech
1743760	1751760	and the City of London together own your identity. You have to pay to use your own identity.
1751760	1756400	That's the privatization of not just the commons, but of yourself, of the individual.
1757360	1763040	To this day, there's no way you can say it's me. Here's proof that it's me. The state could have
1763040	1771040	done that. The state could have certified who you are and given you a long number, which is you
1771040	1775120	and a pin number to certify that, but the state doesn't do that. It leaves it to the private
1775120	1783600	sector, to the concomitants. So that's one. The second development, which created techno feudalism,
1783600	1792720	that spawned huge quantities and qualities of cloud capital, was the response by our governments
1792720	1800080	and central banks to the 2008 crisis, because after April 2009, I don't know if you do remember
1800080	1805120	that there was this meeting here in London presided over by Gordon Brown of the G7,
1806640	1813280	essentially decided to refloat finance, to bail out the bankers worldwide, and they printed
1813280	1824240	together over 13 years, $35 trillion, and they gave you the finances. At the same time, the
1824240	1829520	practice of austerity here in Britain, in Greece, across the European Union, in the United States,
1829520	1836720	austerity for the many, and socialism for the financiers. Now, why is this connected to cloud
1836720	1842320	capital? Because when you create all this amount, huge quantity of money, which circulates,
1842320	1848400	sloshes around the circuits of finance, but people are there, have no money because of austerity,
1848400	1854960	and they can't buy anything. Industrialists, the captains of industry and so on,
1857280	1862240	take Volkswagen for instance, right, or General Motors, they look at the little people and say,
1862880	1868320	as if they can afford to buy something like Google and Tesla. We're not going to invest in it.
1868320	1871120	We're not going to mass produce goods that these people won't be able to buy,
1871760	1874720	but they have all this money because the central banks have printed it and given it to the
1874720	1878960	financiers. The financiers want to give it to these industrialists, so the industrialists think
1878960	1886240	Apple has $200 billion, $200 billion of savings. Now, why do they want money from the central bank
1886240	1890560	if they have savings? They don't, but the central bank picks up the phone and says,
1890560	1894720	I'm going to give it to you for free. So, Apple says, all right, give it to them, and you know what
1894720	1900640	they do? They go to the stock exchange and buy Apple shares. The share price goes up,
1900640	1904160	their bonuses are linked to the share price, they're taking more money.
1906240	1915120	Mr. Cook and the rest, Steve Jobs before, the only ones who took this money and invested it
1916160	1923840	were the ones who invested in cloud capital, the Jeff Bezos and so on. There is no doubt that
1923840	1928960	all the money that has gone into creating the optic fiber cables criss-crossing the oceans,
1928960	1934000	the server farms, the algorithms, the AI and so on,
1936400	1944640	nine out of ten dollars or pounds spent on that came from the huge quantities of money
1944640	1954240	printed by the central banks, by the states. So, the awful response by our governments
1954880	1963440	to the 2008 disaster was part and parcel of what created the UMPH, the funding for the cloud
1963440	1968480	capital that now is taking over the world. It's interesting, actually, we had Mariano
1968480	1972320	Mazzucato in here recently talking about the state's role, I'm sure you know the book,
1972320	1976320	The Entrepreneurial State, right, and the state's role often in being the first mover for a lot
1976320	1980640	of this stuff, socializing the risk, accepting the risk of, let's say, creating the technology we
1980640	1985040	needed to put a man on the moon. But then, at the end, it's the private company who reaps the
1985040	1988800	rewards, it's the private company who takes the profits and the risk is socialized, the
1988800	1995520	profits are privatized. I wonder what you're reading on the states in quotes, not the United
1995520	2003200	States, I mean, a nation state's role is in establishing technofutilism and whether or not
2003200	2008160	you view that relationship between the likes of a musk, a Bezos, as a parasitic one, that they are
2008160	2011840	sort of benefiting from the investment that a state has made in the past.
2013760	2022960	Look, Mariano's thesis is absolutely correct. For decades, the military industrial complex,
2023760	2032400	the state has been central in investing and guiding the investing and having, you know,
2032400	2042480	good civil servants. I'll use a term of abuse or phrase that neoliberals use to abuse the state,
2042480	2046960	picking winners and decided that they're going to build the internet. The internet was not,
2046960	2052000	didn't spontaneously emerge. It was a decision of some people in the Pentagon to create the
2052000	2057520	internet for military purposes, but nevertheless, it did not come out of the marketplace.
2058480	2065040	And then the state comes in and invests. Every technology in your iPhone or your Samsung phone
2065040	2072400	or whatever was invented as a result of some government grant, which was directed in that Wi-Fi
2073200	2078560	came out of the CSIRO in Australia. What did the Australian government get for that? Zero,
2078560	2086720	because it was offered to the commons. Same with GPS. GPS was given for free. They could have
2086720	2094000	charged for it, but they gave it away for free. And then these companies that privatize the cloud,
2094000	2100720	privatize the internet, that's the Mariano Mazzucato story, then also privatize the returns
2101360	2106880	and use it in order to exert more power. And to deplete the capacity of the state to continue
2106880	2112640	doing that, which is like an idiot who sits on a branch of a tree and starts sowing the branch,
2113200	2117840	that I think is more or less the Mariano Mazzucato story. It's a good one, and I agree with that.
2118880	2131520	But as part of the same story comes my story, because by effectively emptying the state of content,
2132240	2138000	of, you know, deprofessionalizing the state, shifting everything to the private sector,
2138080	2145280	subcontracting everything to those conglomerates, the state created a much greater crisis in 2008
2146080	2155360	that would have happened had the state not done this. And then the private sector that was supposed
2155360	2161920	to know better, that's the neoliberal story, right, that the market knows best, collapsed under the
2161920	2169200	weight of its own stupidity and criminality. That was the case in 2008. And a hapless,
2170160	2174640	vacuous state, a state that doesn't have the expertise that it once had. This is the problem
2174640	2179440	we have today, you know. The state does not, why do you think the HS2 is not going to be built?
2179440	2183920	Because the state doesn't have any civil servants who know how to plan the construction of a major
2183920	2192800	project anymore. They've subcontracted everything. But still, they are responsible for saving capitalism
2192800	2197680	for itself in 2008, 2009, under Gordon Branson. So what do they do? They do the only thing they
2197680	2202640	know how to do, which is to print huge quantities of money and give it to the same people who
2202640	2209360	destroyed, nearly destroyed capitalism in 2008. And then what do they do? They give it away,
2209360	2214960	most people, most companies like Volkswagen and Ford and so on, go and buy back their own shares,
2214960	2219920	except for some really smart people like Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk and so on, who take the money,
2219920	2223680	and they are the only ones who invest. And I wouldn't call them parasites, you know.
2224400	2230800	I mean, I dislike all of them. But the person I consider a little must be an evil genius.
2231360	2237920	The emphasis on the genius, though, he's absolutely, spectacularly smart in the way that
2237920	2246240	SpaceX. He beat NASA on its own game. He actually created spaceships that can actually land
2246240	2254240	on their bottom, right, without being destroyed. You know, that's not to be scoffed at. So these people
2256000	2262240	created capital goods, what I call cloud capital, which is wonderful that we have it. I mean, I'm
2262240	2267360	all in favor of artificial intelligence. You know, when I spent the summer translating this book
2267360	2274720	using depot, and of course, working on top of it, I loved it. You know, I'm addicted to my phone
2274720	2279680	and to Google and to all those things. No, Facebook, I hate them, but that's my problem.
2280800	2286480	I use Twitter all the time, even though it's like, who put it that way? I can't remember.
2286480	2291120	You said it magnificently. It's like taking everything that's written on the walls of
2291120	2296000	mail toilets all over the world and putting it online. But nevertheless, you know, when I want
2296000	2299040	to publicize my book, I use Twitter when I want to have a political fight with somebody,
2299040	2304480	have it over Twitter. I'm not saying that they are useless. I'm not saying that they are parasitical.
2304480	2310320	What I'm saying is that the form of capital, which is creating a new socioeconomic order,
2310320	2315600	which is not viable, and it's not the fault of the machinery. It is not the fault of the technologies.
2317600	2323680	It is who owns them. But that is a Marxist critique of capitalism to begin with. The problem is not
2323680	2330160	the machine. The problem is who owns the machines and who doesn't have access to them unless they
2330160	2334960	provide free labor or very cheap labor in the case of capitalism, free labor in the case of
2334960	2339920	techno feudalism. Let's talk about that order a little bit more then. We've named the individuals
2339920	2346000	that sort of the cloud lists the people that could be said to form our new ruling class.
2346000	2351760	Let's talk, could you talk a little bit more, I should say, about how their rise and their supremacy
2351760	2357600	then places people like you and me as serfs in that system, how that dynamic works?
2361040	2370160	The moment they can create a cloud thief, which attracts us, because let's face it,
2370160	2378800	if I want to buy a book quickly, which I can't find on bookshop.co.uk, I'll go to Amazon
2379760	2384000	especially if I need to read something quickly and get it on Kindle. I go to the page, the relevant
2384000	2391040	page, if I'm writing an op-ed for the newspaper, I do it. So they create a cloud thief, which you
2391040	2398800	really need and want to be on. Once you're on it, you are helping without realizing it, reproduce
2399360	2406000	its capital stock, the capital stock that gives it power over you. So you are a serf without knowing
2406000	2411520	it, a voluntary serf, but of course the worst slavery is the one that people volunteer for.
2414240	2427200	Jeff Bezos then can use the attractiveness of this cloud thief essentially to siphon off the
2427200	2435520	capitalist sector, most of the profits, because when you chance 40% rent for anything sold on
2435520	2442960	your cloud thief, then essentially you decimate the profit basis of the capitalist. So the capitalist,
2442960	2448000	the standard capitalist, the old-fashioned capitalist, becomes a vessel to the cloud
2448000	2455520	capitalist or cloud-alist, I'll call them cloud-alists for short. We are cloud serfs to them.
2456880	2464640	In the Amazon warehouse, the people who work there as precarious, they don't have any rights
2464640	2473040	really, they're precarious labor, nomad land. Watch the movie if you haven't, you see what I mean.
2474160	2480080	They have electronic devices strapped to the wrist, which monitor their every move, tell them
2481840	2493120	which part of the warehouse to go to next, what box to pick up. So they are cloud trolls.
2493120	2501520	I mean, if you've seen the wonderful movie Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin, what he depicts there
2501520	2508400	is now full-on through the cloud, because it's the same cloud capital that connects
2509200	2517200	Alexa on your desktop, your laptop which creates cloud capital or recreates the cloud capital
2517200	2527200	of Amazon.com, the software that drives proletarians or precariously employed workers in the warehouse,
2527200	2533840	the drivers who are delivering the stuff. This is all a new form of
2534640	2542320	mutant capital, which I call cloud capital, which also puts the lid on the profitability
2542320	2546800	of the capitalist class, which means that because these people never pay tax,
2547360	2553520	that states will always be impoverished, states will then have to increase VAT,
2554800	2561520	which is the most regressive tax. So, you know, it's the plot thickens. It becomes a completely
2561520	2568720	different kind of system. One could call it rentier capital capitalism or platform capitalism,
2568720	2576160	but I insist on shifting away from the word capitalism, because it will help us concentrate
2576160	2581840	our mind on what the gigantic transformation is, the equivalent of moving from feudalism to
2581840	2587440	capitalism. Do you think we'll ever be able to tax them effectively? No. Why? Well, because they're
2587440	2592960	too smart and they have better accountants than the government has, and they can shift from one
2592960	2604800	country to another. And it is impossible to create the state power, or recreate the state power,
2605360	2615360	against their own cloudless power, to defeat them legally in terms of accounting, in terms of how
2615360	2620240	they managed to push their profits from one jurisdiction to the other until it lands in
2620240	2629040	some jurisdiction where no corporate tax is being levied. If we're going to defeat them,
2629920	2635280	and if we're going to turn this into a viable society, the global society, we must forget
2635280	2642560	about taxing them. We must think in old Marxist terms, how do we take their cloud capital away
2642560	2650640	from them? And how do we socialize it? So it's easier to imagine the end of the private property
2650640	2657840	of cloud capital than it is to imagine the proper taxation of cloud rents. Well, go on to that in a
2657840	2664480	moment. We'll talk about viable alternatives. What a more progressive, call it a utopia future,
2664480	2669920	whatever you like, looks like. However, is there, do you find it compelling to suggest,
2670320	2675200	I sit here in this conversation with you and I go, Janice, you know what? I don't want anything to
2675200	2678640	do with this. I'm getting rid of my phone. I'm getting rid of my laptop and I'm going to go and
2678640	2682480	live in a cabin in the woods and grow my own vegetables. Forget about it. See you later. I
2682480	2687680	don't want to engage. How do you answer that criticism? How do you try and compel people to
2687680	2693440	not go, God, this is the power, the wealth of the forces we're up against is so significant
2693440	2698720	that I just don't have the appetite to try and combat it? There aren't enough good and huts for
2698720	2704880	all of us to do that. And I don't believe you will do it. You may claim, you may feel desperate
2704880	2709360	and you may think that this is a lost cause and you may say that, oh, I'm going to do that,
2709360	2714080	but you're not going to do it. Even if you do it, you know, two months later, you'll come back,
2714080	2722160	you will crawl back into London using your phone again. So, you know, an escape to a
2722160	2731200	eucolic past that never really existed is not the solution. Is it possible though to opt out?
2731200	2735680	Maybe not in the way I've just described, but you know, you talked earlier about the way these
2735680	2740000	companies co-opt or identities. Is it possible for us to opt out of that process? Is it possible
2740000	2744800	for us to steal back what belongs to us? It's like saying, is it possible for somebody who comes from
2744800	2752240	rags to end up with riches? The answer is yes, but only if it's one person or a handful of persons.
2752240	2757760	A handful of persons could rise from rags to riches. They can go from being, you know,
2757760	2764000	Amazon warehouse workers to being cloudless. No doubt. No doubt. There is this degree of
2764000	2771760	social mobility, but it is impossible for society to escape as a society from techno feudalism.
2772560	2777440	You mentioned at the beginning the geopolitics or the conflict Cold War,
2777440	2782560	whatever you like, between the United States and China, and that it's wrong to understand that conflict
2783120	2787360	as a sort of traditional geopolitical game, but instead as a conflict between two
2788320	2792960	superpower cloud fiefs. So, please, can you talk about that a little bit more? And I guess I'd
2792960	2801680	ask you, glibly, as well, who's winning that war? Okay. Before I answer the second part, let me
2801680	2809680	explain what I mean. The rise of China is an American story in the same way that the creation
2809680	2815760	of the European Union is an American project. We Europeans like to think that we had a fantastic
2815760	2821680	idea to end the war in Europe. We had that idea, but the EU would never have been great without
2821680	2829200	Americans planning and executing the plan for the creation of the EU. Similarly, the rise of
2829200	2835120	China, okay, thanks to being played an important role by opening up, but what happened essentially
2835120	2841360	was this. There was a dark deal, I call it in the book, between the United States
2842320	2844320	ruling class and the Chinese Communist Party.
2845120	2853280	Industry would shift from the United States manufacturing to China.
2856640	2861280	China would be the Chinese capitalists would be exporting to the United States.
2862880	2867200	They would be getting paid in dollars that the United States would have to print
2868160	2872480	because the United States was a deficit country, remains a deficit country,
2873200	2879200	but that deficit would be sustainable. Why? Because all the profits, the dollar profits,
2880080	2884400	or the vast majority of the dollar profits of the Chinese capitalist would go to Wall Street
2884400	2893760	and be invested in real estate, in shares, in derivatives, and in bonds. In other words,
2893760	2898400	a large part of the Chinese profits from selling to the United States would be financing the American
2898400	2905680	government. That's a synergy. They are accomplices. The Chinese Communist Party and the American
2905680	2915920	rentier capitalist are partners. So why are they now moving apart and threatening the world with
2915920	2925360	Armageddon with a new Cold War that may end up into a thermonuclear war? That question was in my
2926320	2931520	mind for a very long time and I didn't have an answer to it until I noticed WeChat.
2932960	2939280	WeChat is an application that belongs to Tencent, a conglomerate, a big tech
2940640	2947520	megalith in China. I realized that the West doesn't have anything like that. Imagine
2948560	2954640	if there was an app, and by the way, that's what Elon Musk wants to do when he calls an
2954640	2960080	everything app. That's WeChat. Imagine there is an app that allows you to send messages,
2961120	2968640	watch TikTok-like videos, watch movies, listen to music, everything that's Spotify,
2969440	2976640	Netflix, Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal, and so on do. Everything in one app plus
2978080	2984240	free payments. You don't have that now here. You need to download the application of Lloyds Bank,
2984240	2989760	of Barclays Bank, of Bank of America, and so on. They charge you an arm and a leg to make payments
2989760	2998320	or they charge proprietors, shops, shopkeepers, an arm and a leg, Apple Pay. They charge huge rents
2999040	3005920	for making these transactions. WeChat, free payments and you can have any WeChat app.
3006560	3016080	All you need is a bank account somewhere in China, in one. So suddenly, this amazing deal
3016800	3023120	that the United States had with China, but also with the European Union, a little aside,
3023680	3028560	when the euro came out, everybody was saying, oh, this is great because we Europeans will be able
3028560	3033120	to compete with the dollar, the exorbitant privilege of the dollar, the supremacy of the dollar is
3033120	3037120	going to be challenged by the euro. That never happened and never will happen. Why? Because
3037120	3042560	if you're a German industrialist, if you, you know, Mercedes Benz or a Dutch industrialist,
3043200	3050320	you don't want the euro to usurp the power of the dollar because your money, most of your
3050320	3056640	profits come from selling to the Americans. Now the Americans are a deficit country. The only
3056640	3062320	reason why you sell to them is because they have the state deficit, which they cover with dollars,
3062880	3068240	and the only reason why you accept dollars is because of the exorbitant privilege of the dollar.
3068240	3073520	So you don't want the euro to undermine the power of the dollar as a European capitalist.
3074800	3080320	The greatest strength of the American dollar is foreign capitalists, not the CIA, not the American
3080320	3086880	military, not Biden, none of these people. It is a foreign capitalist who freaks out at the thought
3087440	3093440	that the dollar will lose its authority and power. That applies to the Chinese
3093440	3098880	capitalists who do not want to see the one, the Chinese currency, overtake the American one.
3099760	3106320	But the Chinese, because they have, due to the power of the Chinese Communist Party,
3106320	3110480	fused their big tech with their big banks, something that's not happening in the United States,
3110480	3114880	Wall Street will never allow Silicon Valley to go anywhere near the payment system.
3115600	3123440	So they are at loggerheads, Big Tech and Silicon Valley, sorry, Silicon Valley and Wall Street.
3123440	3129040	In China, they refuse the one thing. That's why you have a WeChat. Add to that the central bank
3129040	3134880	digital currency, which allows you and me, the foreigners as well, to have a digital wallet
3134880	3143120	in China with three transactions, in one, of course. Suddenly, the predominance of the dollar
3143920	3150480	comes into question. The Trump administration started the Cold War by freezing Huawei out.
3150480	3155680	In my estimation, it's because of that. Nothing to do with Huawei posing a national security
3155680	3160960	threat or anything like that. And then you have the war in Ukraine. And the confiscation of $400
3160960	3169680	billion, owned by the Russian Central Bank, by the West, primarily the United States.
3169680	3173280	I'm not going to start a conversation about whether they should have done that or not.
3173280	3178480	All I'm saying is that if you are a Saudi Arabian prince, an Indonesian oligarch,
3179440	3183120	and of course a Russian, but even a Ukrainian oligarch, you never know what happens after the war.
3183840	3190960	And you see that these Americans have no qualms confiscating your money, hundreds of billions
3190960	3198000	of dollars. Then you think twice before you put all your money in dollars. So this superhighway
3198000	3201600	of payments, of free payments that the Chinese have created, which they didn't even want to use
3201600	3206080	themselves because they want the American dollar because their capitalist profits come from the
3206080	3214000	American. Suddenly, it sees a lot of traffic. And Wall Street, they are shitting their pants.
3214000	3219760	Excuse my French. It's welcome because they think, oh my God, here we have an alternative to the
3219760	3227760	dollar system. I think this is what's underpinning the New Cold War. When Biden announced that
3227760	3235200	essentially what he told the Chinese in the fall of 2021 was, we will prevent you from becoming
3235200	3240560	in a technological advanced country. When you ban the sale of advanced chips, chips to a country
3240560	3247280	like China, you're saying you will stay technologically backwards. Well, that's a declaration of war.
3247600	3255600	A technological war, but economic war. So they start decoupling themselves and they start
3256160	3263920	putting more emphasis on this alternative payment system. So it's a clash of two cloud fiefs,
3264560	3271840	two cloud techno feudalisms, a clash between two payment systems, both of them digital,
3271840	3277360	both of them living on the cloud. One dollar denominated, the other one denominated. And where
3277360	3283680	is Britain? Where is the European Union? Nowhere. We are utterly insignificant.
3285600	3290080	It's a reassuring place to be, isn't it? So I don't mind being insignificant. It's just that,
3290080	3295520	you know, our politicians have not gotten onto that. What's actually happening? Yeah, they keep
3295600	3302160	thinking up and making Britain great again, the European Union that is going to become a
3302160	3309600	significant force if we integrate more and we have more countries in the Balkans and Ukraine and so
3309600	3318320	rubbish. We are nobodies. It is China on the one hand with the coalescence of the bricks around it
3318880	3324000	and the United States on the other hand. That's a very unstable world to live in and doesn't
3324000	3328800	augur very well for the European continent, including Britain. Could you talk a little bit about
3329680	3336000	how cryptocurrency fits into that network? Because I assume on the one hand this possibly
3336000	3342400	democratised, direct, discreet system for financial transactions essentially threatens
3342400	3345120	the stability and the supremacy of those two payment systems you just mentioned, though.
3346080	3354640	I think that crypto is overblown. It's macroeconomically and sociologically insignificant.
3355440	3360480	It is technically fascinating when the algorithm for Bitcoin came out
3362800	3367920	by Nakamoto or somebody called Nakamoto in 2008. I spent quite a few months studying it.
3368880	3374240	I was fascinated by the technology and why the magazine interviewed me back then.
3374240	3378080	What did I think of it? And I said it's a fantastic solution to a problem we have not discovered yet.
3378880	3383120	It's not money and it can never be money. And I explained in the book why it can never be money.
3384160	3388320	It can be a speculative asset, which is what it is. I mean nobody uses Bitcoin to buy stuff.
3389520	3395920	And it would be crazy to use it to buy stuff if you think about it because imagine that I mean
3395920	3400880	to begin with Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It has to have a fixed supply in order to have value.
3401840	3405520	But at the moment, lots of people use it to buy things.
3406960	3413360	And more people come in, demand for Bitcoin increases. So its dollar value or pound value rises.
3413360	3418400	At some point, when it exceeds a certain point, if it starts working as a function, as a currency,
3418960	3423360	then people are better off using pounds again and keeping holding their Bitcoin.
3424160	3426480	So there is a plateau. There is an inbuilt
3428000	3434400	ceiling, which does not prevent Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency from functioning
3434400	3439680	like a means of exchange. So then it becomes a speculative thing. And then you have an oligarchy
3439680	3448720	of those early adopters who are sitting on very valuable piles, stashes of Bitcoins.
3448720	3455920	So I don't find it interesting. I find the blockchain technology very interesting.
3455920	3462160	And in my previous book, Another Now, which was a political science fiction novel,
3463200	3469840	where I imagine Another Now, how could things have developed today in a socialist world
3469840	3477040	after 2008? How would things work? Blockchain is part of the deal. But it is not a way out
3477040	3482640	of capitalism or techno-fidelism. It is a technology that we will use once we are free
3483200	3489680	of the yoke of capital. You addressed the book to your father, who hoped that a capitalist order
3489680	3495840	would be replaced by a socialist utopia for the benefit of society. And one of the striking
3495840	3499520	things, well, I wanted to ask you, I was about to ask you, you're almost interviewing yourself,
3500480	3504480	about Another Now, because obviously it was one of the things in socialism, right?
3504560	3508320	There are very few blueprints out there about what the future society could look like, and that is
3508320	3513360	provided in Another Now. You have described it, you have just literally described it as science
3513360	3519440	fiction. So I don't know how valid it is as a comparison to techno-fidelism and as an alternative.
3520000	3527520	But you mentioned democratised company and democratised money. And I wonder if you do
3527520	3531600	think those are viable alternatives to the reality that you're describing in this book.
3532160	3538480	They are the only viable models, because What We Have Now is not viable. It's real,
3539360	3544960	but it's not sustainable. The economic crisis we are facing, and which we will continue to face,
3544960	3550960	have to do with the fact that value is created in a tiny sector of the economy, which is shrinking,
3551840	3556400	the capitalist sector of the economy. That's where value is produced by wage labor, but that is
3556480	3565360	shrinking. We have an increasing domain of free labor, of cloud service, of cloud capital,
3566080	3573440	of the platforms, which are parasitic to a shrinking capitalist base. So our crisis,
3573440	3577680	financial crisis, economic crisis, cost of living crisis are going to be getting worse and worse
3577680	3584480	and worse, just like the climate crisis. So this is not a viable system. It's a system we live in,
3585040	3591120	but we are stampeding towards oblivion, both socially and environmentally.
3592480	3598000	So the reason why I wrote Another Now, by the way, science fiction is not about any fairy
3598000	3603360	stuff. Science fiction is not about the future. Science fiction is an innovative way of writing
3603360	3609040	about the past and the present. That's why I always loved science fiction. So as a socialist
3609040	3615440	and a politician, I always have to answer the guy in the pub or the last in the pub who says to me,
3615440	3620080	okay, mate, if you don't like the way things are, how should they be? And that's a difficult question,
3620080	3623920	and I didn't have an answer to that. That's why I sat down and I wrote that novel, which was about,
3623920	3630880	you know, if our revolution occupied Wall Street and so on had succeeded in 2008, what could life
3630880	3637680	be like now, given the technologies we have and, you know, the fallen nature of humanity
3638640	3646720	that is a given, right? We are imperfect beings. So I tried to imagine what would corporate law
3646720	3654960	be like. So I advocate the idea of one worker, one employee, one share, one vote,
3655840	3659600	which if you think about it, it's such an easy idea in the same way you have one vote
3660160	3665440	when you go to the polling stations, you have one vote as a worker, and you cannot buy votes,
3665440	3670400	you cannot lease votes, you cannot rent them, in the same way you can't in the political system.
3670400	3677120	So imagine that. Suddenly, without revolution, without having, you know, without storming
3677120	3683520	Backingham Palace or the Winter Palace or whatever, suddenly you have totally democratized
3684320	3689840	the world of work, and you have done away with the stock exchanges because if you can't sell and
3689840	3694800	buy shares, then it was a point of the stock exchange. And if you have the central bank,
3694800	3698480	the Bank of England, let's say, or the European Central Bank, giving each one of us
3699760	3705280	a free digital wallet with a pin number where we can park our money, then what's the point
3705280	3711280	of having an account with Lloyds? Barclays. You don't even need to be authoritarian and
3712800	3718160	ban them. They will just shrivel and die, unless they can provide you with services
3718800	3723600	that they are not providing you now. I mean, the only reason why you now have an account
3723600	3730480	with a private banker is because it's the only way of using your money. So another now was all
3730480	3736560	about being practical in a science fiction type of way in answering the question, how could things
3736560	3746000	be functioning today? Do you think we can get that? Well, I don't think I'm going to live to see it,
3746000	3751440	if that's what you're asking. Mind you, I'm getting old anyway, so that doesn't matter.
3751840	3758480	So this is the bad news. The bad news is that I'm not optimistic. But I think that to be optimistic
3758480	3763920	today, you have to be a real fool given that there's no empirical evidence pointing to good
3763920	3770800	outcomes. But then again, imagine this being the 1770s. And I mentioned the 1770s because that was
3770800	3777200	the time when Adam Smith was writing his Wealth of Nations, which spearheaded, spearheaded, introduced
3777200	3782480	the world to the great transformation of the time from feudalism to capitalism. If I'm right that
3782480	3787280	today we're living in the same moment of transformation from capitalism to taking feudalism,
3787920	3793280	I think the 1770s is a good point in time to compare ourselves with. So imagine this was the
3793280	3799920	1770s and I was advocating a world without slavery. And you were interviewing me and you said,
3799920	3805680	do you think this is going to happen? I probably would say to you, no. I can't imagine, you know,
3805680	3813440	there had been no human society without slavery beforehand. So how could the human mind in the
3813440	3819920	1770s imagine a world where slavery was universally condemned and bound? So on the one hand,
3820960	3825440	totally pessimistic. On the other hand, absolutely hopeful. Good.
3825440	3829040	Mr. Farkees, thank you so much for coming in. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.
