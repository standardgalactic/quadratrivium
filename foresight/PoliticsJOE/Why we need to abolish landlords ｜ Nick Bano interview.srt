1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,120
a lot of landlords see themselves as good people. They are participating in an immensely harmful

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,000
economic system. We've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again. We've got to

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,280
rediscover a sense of shame and a sense of direct participation in the harm that we see around us

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:21,040
today. They seem to think that they're entitled to respect and I just feel that like the law is on

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,400
their side, economics is on their side, the politicians are on their side, the courts are on

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,600
their side. The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them and make them feel ashamed is

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:33,440
laughable. Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism and that's a dangerous place to be in.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,040
Nick Banno, hi, welcome to Politics Show. Thanks so much for having me, great to be here.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,320
Yeah, well thank you for coming. How would you like to introduce yourself?

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,760
I am a housing lawyer specialising in legal aid housing work. I've also got a bit of a background

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
in more street politics kind of things and have an interest in a Marxist understanding of

12
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,160
political economy. Is that the impetus behind this book? Yeah, I just felt like a lot of the

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,040
writing we were seeing about housing used some Marxist concepts a bit loosely and I wanted to

14
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,640
get really under the hood of the housing crisis and see how it works from a kind of particularly

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,800
Marxist perspective. I could ask you a really, really broad question. In broad terms, what do you

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:21,120
mean by that? By a Marxist perspective. Yeah. Well, classical economists, neoclassical economists

17
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,000
see the role of economics as the allocation of scarce resources and Marx opens capital by saying

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,160
we live in a world that has so much stuff in it. There is so many commodities in the world.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,480
How is it that everyone is poor? So he starts from a place of abundance and he tries to work out

20
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,480
what the forces are in the world that make us live lives of misery and struggle in a world

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,640
that produces so much and this takes a vaguely similar approach to housing and it says not

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,840
only is there so much housing in Britain but there's an awful lot of housing wealth and how is

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
it that when there's all this money and all these homes, we live in cities that are packed with

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,800
gunnels with homes? How is it that all of us living in housing poverty and in very, very bad

25
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,240
conditions? Is that why you've just written for The Guardian about how we don't need more supply?

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,560
Yeah, it really touched a nerve that the supply issue is really kind of a throwaway line in the

27
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,320
book. I just have this quick justification of why I'm not talking about supply but I feel that

28
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,440
supply has dominated the discourse for so long that people found it really surprising. A lot of

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,760
people found it quite upsetting and shocking that you challenged the accepted wisdom that you kind

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,880
of put the property developers to proof that there is this massive shortage because that's not

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,360
really what the stats bear out if we look at Britain in historical terms or if we look at the UK

32
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,520
in comparative international terms. But I mean, you know, the short I suppose that accepted

33
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,480
wisdom is because you would think that with more supply that would I suppose liquidate

34
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,640
the market and make the housing stock more affordable? Isn't that not true?

35
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,440
Well, that's the thinking. I think it's difficult to find a great deal of evidence for that.

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,840
If it does work like that, then the amount of surplus you'd need to build to have any meaningful

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,720
impact on price would be staggering. And given that the planet is dying and given that there are

38
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,920
other ways of doing it, given that we can regulate a housing market out of crisis, then it seems to me

39
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,280
dangerous to obsess ourselves with the idea of supply, to build a vast surplus when we don't

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,840
need to, when we can just tweak a few legal and economic levers and get ourselves out of it that

41
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,080
way. Talk to me about regulating the prices down. Yeah, so in most countries and most sensible

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,680
places around the world, landlords don't have a complete free reign to work out what they can

43
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,160
extract from tenants without physically killing them. In most places around the world, there's

44
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,520
some sort of cap or break or regulation that governs the way in which rental markets work.

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:47,360
And of course, historically, that was the case here too, but it was completely destroyed

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,520
in the late 80s and early 90s. So we're quite unusual in not having any form of rent regulation.

47
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,200
And one of the things that lots of us are campaigning for is to restore it

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,920
with the hope that that would restore ourselves to something like a pre-crisis state of affairs.

49
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,160
Because this landmark policy is going to be introduced in Scotland. Yes.

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,680
But the accepted wisdom of that down here is that that actually drives up prices.

51
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,640
I don't know if that's the accepted wisdom. I think it's said a lot. I think it's said an awful

52
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:24,640
lot. And I think it's true that rent controls can be done badly, but that's not a conceptual

53
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,040
problem with rent controls. If it were the case that rent controls were generally bad,

54
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,840
then they would have been abolished in every country in Europe when, of course,

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,080
they tend to be present in most European countries where there are problems with

56
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
implementing rent controls. They can be fixed. We can make things better.

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,920
But the idea that a particular policy is leading to problems and therefore

58
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,640
we just need to let the free market run rampant in Scottish housing is bizarre to me.

59
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,920
I mean, so in layman's terms, feel free to talk to me like an idiot.

60
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,120
If you're going to set a period of time in which rents cannot rise, is that not going to give way

61
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,480
to landlords just pushing up the prices to start with?

62
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,840
It might. But then, of course, that's a short-term pain for a much longer-term

63
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,120
public benefit. And I also think that all of these scarce stories we hear about rent controls

64
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,720
generally paint a picture of a world that's a lot better than the one we're currently living in,

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,880
like a lot of these these these healthscapes I would take over the present housing crisis

66
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,280
that so many people are suffering through. Right. What about, I mean, is there not a possibility

67
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,320
as well that, I mean, over the last couple of years, obviously, you know, well, after COVID,

68
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,960
we've seen a sharp rise, a ridiculous rise in rents, particularly in London, in Manchester,

69
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,720
and even actually suburban towns. But is there not a chance that rents are going to come down

70
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,560
by themselves? Well, the class of landlords is not known for being generous and unself-interested.

71
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,000
They're, of course, assisted by letting agents whose only job it is to tell them, look,

72
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,680
this is what we think the market will tolerate. This is what you can get out of this property.

73
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,120
So it would be surprising if landlords acted against their own self-interest by saying,

74
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,920
I'm going to undercut and go below the market rent. So there's a chain then that's driving

75
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,040
rents at the moment? There are structural forces at work. I think when a landlord buys a rental

76
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,800
property, baked into that sale price is the idea that the rent will keep on rising. That's what

77
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
makes it valuable to them. So when a landlord says, I'm not going to put the rent up in line with

78
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,640
the market, I'm going to keep it low, that signals or contributes to the idea that it wasn't worth

79
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,120
the purchase price in the first place. It signals or contributes to the idea that the next landlord

80
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,880
who wants to buy it is not making a very good investment because, in fact, the rent it's currently

81
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,560
generating is lower. So there's a structural impetus on landlords to raise the rent. It

82
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,800
justifies the purchase price of their product. It's not just mean people saying, we want to

83
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,960
drive people further into poverty. So going back to what you were talking about before then,

84
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,440
you were talking about how supply is not driving house prices. I mean, is it landlords?

85
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,440
What is the root cause? What is driving? The market's argument is that rents in cities are

86
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,000
what he calls monopoly prices. So it's the highest price that will be tolerated under

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,920
given social circumstances without physically driving the class of tenants out of existence.

88
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,080
And what landlords have been doing over the past few decades is realizing and developing their

89
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,680
economic power. And what seems to be happening at the moment is landlords are realizing that

90
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,280
they can just say, do you know what? There is a fee for viewing. And they say it and it becomes

91
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,680
true. It's not that there's suddenly a massive structural adjustment in the number of people

92
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,640
or the number of homes. It's landlords demonstrating the economic power they have over us. They make

93
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:44,560
a demand, they see if we meet it. And when we do, they say, that is the reality now.

94
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,760
But is that happening all over then?

95
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,080
It's certainly happening in London.

96
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,240
They're charging for viewing or am I sorry, did I just misinterpret that?

97
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,440
I've heard rumors about charging for viewings. I've heard rumors about bidding wars. I've heard

98
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,800
rumors about listed rents not being natural rent you pay. And of course, the more landlords

99
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,400
cotton onto this, the worse the problem becomes. Right. So we're creating a, we're creating our

100
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,240
entomies actually by giving into them. We don't really have a choice. We're not being generous

101
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,560
here. I mean, we really do need places to live. And if this is the demand that landlords make

102
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
of us, we don't really have a choice but to say, well, that's what I'll have to do.

103
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,840
Can you talk to me about state backed rent rising? So when you have these short life

104
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,600
tendencies, which dominate the private rented sector, where you have absolutely no security,

105
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,880
landlords are free to demand whatever rent they want. And when the state says,

106
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,960
this is the housing benefit. And by the way, I'm putting housing benefits up.

107
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,000
What the landlords can do is just generate that state spending into additional income for themselves.

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
They can raise the rents in line with housing benefit rises when there is no cap, when there is

109
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,480
no break. So you have this system where even the best intentioned policies of the state,

110
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,360
which are aims to kind of reduce poverty and to make people's lives easier, are just converted

111
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,480
into higher state spending on landlords, which of course is a massive problem for the tax bill.

112
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
And a massive benefit for landlords. So the taxpayer is subsidising landlords.

113
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,840
So the tune of billions of pounds, and it's a number that keeps coming up.

114
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
Makes me feel really good that. Yeah, well, you must be a landlord.

115
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,040
No, I mean, just I'm paying twice. Well, exactly. Yeah, exactly. It's the state that's paying.

116
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,080
It's obviously tenants that are paying and it's employers that are paying because obviously

117
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,720
wages in this country have to be sensationally high just so that people can meet their housing costs.

118
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,920
But also with housing benefit, a landlord doesn't have to take a tenant that is on housing benefit.

119
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,920
They can say that certain properties are exempt for some reason.

120
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
Well, in principle, they do because it tends to be unlawfully discriminatory to refuse to

121
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,040
take housing benefit tenants. But that tends to take brave and dogged tenants bringing legal

122
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,200
challenges. It's not very good at filtering through into the reality of the world. And we know that

123
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,400
it happens. You know that it happens a lot. But what you do have is the sort of base layer of

124
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:11,760
housing provision in Britain is met by housing benefit. That's the state kind of underwriting

125
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,280
the bottom of the housing market and everything else is built on top of that.

126
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,160
So as and when housing benefit rises and the lowest rents meet to rise to match those,

127
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,920
the higher up rents rise with it and it's a tide that seems to be lifting all ships.

128
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,040
So housing benefit is driving higher rents? In part, and obviously I'm not saying the state is

129
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,720
bad and the state should cut housing benefit, of course it shouldn't. But I do think it's

130
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,560
interesting to think about the way in which the state is tearing its hair out saying,

131
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
what are we going to do about the housing crisis? Well, at the same time,

132
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,160
just having this open checkbook and saying for us landlords can demand what they want and we

133
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,960
will just continue to pay. But what's the simple resolution to that then? Because I mean, when

134
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:54,560
you talk about supply or, you know, supply not being the answer, if there was a supply of homes

135
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,200
that were owned by the council, is that not a resolution to the housing benefit crisis?

136
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,600
Absolutely. And of course, housing benefit, housing, council tenants are rent capped,

137
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,720
housing tenants are rent controlled, same with social housing providers. If we did that in the

138
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,600
private rented sector, of course, state spending on housing would massively go down. You know,

139
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm particularly concerned about the housing that's provided to homeless households, which are often

140
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:24,240
charged nightly, which are charged utterly exorbitant rates and many, many of them are in

141
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,960
buildings that the council had once built as council housing. So the state's paid for it once

142
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,440
and now it's continuing to pay for it over and over again in the form of private rents.

143
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,280
So this goes back to Margaret Thatcher? A lot of it does. It goes back to Margaret Thatcher and

144
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:42,320
to Tony Blair, because of course, while it's right to point out that Thatcher dismantled rent

145
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,280
controls, what kept the landlords in check for most of the 20th century was that they were scared

146
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,080
that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords, labor would come and turn it round again. And

147
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,280
when you have a long term investment like land, that tended to keep the landlords at bay a bit.

148
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,080
So when Tony Blair said rent controls are never coming back, I'm keeping what Thatcher has,

149
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:08,320
that signals to the landlords, you go wild, you go crazy. So what sort of signal is Keir Starmer

150
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,040
sending to landlords at the moment then? If you know, if we take the premise that perhaps he's

151
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,280
well, he's utilizing a bit of Blair? Well, I think he's being curiously quiet. And I think what's

152
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,680
interesting is that he, I mean, he's been outflanked on the Renters Rights Bill. I don't think it's a

153
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,840
policy he himself would have come up with. And he can't do very much better than the bill that

154
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,360
the Tories originally put forward. So he's not saying very much about housing. But what he is,

155
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,880
is nothing extraordinary, nothing remarkable compared to what any other politician is saying.

156
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,120
The Renters Reform Bill, I mean, it has dominated the new cycle, partly because it's

157
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,360
the only policy that is actually being put forward by the Conservatives at the moment.

158
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,960
And a lot of those, the original ideas have been watered down, and they have been relaxed.

159
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,040
But there is one little bit in there about Section 21, I find really interesting. And I was just

160
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:06,480
wondering, like, what's your interpretation of abolishing Section 21? When I saw the bill,

161
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,760
I thought it was surprisingly good. I think when the Tories were kind of forced into making this

162
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:17,120
pledge in the 2019 election manifesto, I think they thought it was quite a technical, fluffy,

163
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,840
family-friendly policy. I don't think they quite realized that Section 21 is one of the key

164
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,000
kind of cornerstones of the Thatcherite housing settlement. As I explained a minute ago, it's

165
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,440
what allows landlords to demand a higher rent whenever housing benefit goes up. So when you

166
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,320
abolish Section 21 and introduce that little bit more security, it becomes that much easier

167
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,440
with tenants to say, actually, I'm not paying this higher rent, you're going to have to go

168
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,640
through a legal process to raise it. So it should, it could have the effect of dampening

169
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,480
the kind of runaway pace of rent rises that we're used to seeing.

170
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,000
I think if it is abolished, it'll take some time to bed in because, of course,

171
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,760
it's been abolished in Scotland. And Scotland is still, Scottish tenants are finding their power

172
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,360
and Scottish landlords are realizing the loss of theirs. But those kind of

173
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,560
behavioral changes can take years, if not decades, to bed in.

174
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Well, also, I mean, you know, there's a theoretical loss of power that could be

175
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,200
experienced by the landlord. But, you know, we've just, we've just spoken about housing benefit a

176
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,400
moment ago, and we said that, you know, even though they are landlords, don't take tenants

177
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,200
that, you know, have housing benefits, even though that they are legally required to. So,

178
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,320
I mean, will it actually, you know, will it give power back to tenants, do you think,

179
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,240
in actual practice? Because how many young people, especially in today's market, have the time

180
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,920
or the know-how to take a landlord to court?

181
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,080
Yeah. And of course, that's going to be the challenge that the housing movement faces.

182
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,560
It's going to be re-skilling a generation of renters as to their rights. But I do think it's

183
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,040
going to be crucial in terms of the number of people who don't complain to their landlords

184
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:59,440
about housing conditions because of section 21. It suddenly gives them a much safer environment

185
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,080
to do that, to say, you know, I pay you money for this service, you've got to fix the boiler,

186
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,520
you've got to fix the damp.

187
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,400
That's really interesting about not complaining, because it's true, isn't it? Most tenants don't

188
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,160
don't speak up because they are worried that they're going to be evicted.

189
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,920
I mean, I think it's true for all of us. I think we've all experienced it. And I think one of the

190
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,200
really weird and amazing things about the housing market here is that if your landlord comes round

191
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,960
and says, oh, there's a bit of a damp problem, I'm going to do something about that,

192
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,040
you genuinely don't know whether that's the landlord behaving themselves or the landlord

193
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,800
gearing up to evict you. So even if you have a nice landlord, you live under such a looming threat

194
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,920
that it wreaks havoc with people's sense of stability and their mental health and their

195
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,880
capacity to build their lives. It's a horrible situation.

196
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,280
Landlords don't really do too well with being told that they have to, you know,

197
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,040
with more regulations being slapped on them. I mean, a couple of years ago, we were talking about,

198
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,600
actually might have been last year, we were talking about energy efficiency and how all

199
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:05,360
properties now had to be energy efficient. You know, you couldn't have a single glazing or a

200
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,600
roof that allowed heat to evaporate. How did that increased regulation go down?

201
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,520
Well, yeah, it wasn't popular. And it's really interesting because I think a few years ago,

202
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,200
it would have been seen as something of a fringe issue. But with the massive rise in energy bills,

203
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,520
the energy performance of people's homes is life changing financial decisions.

204
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,400
And it's only fair that landlords should, the ones who benefit from the housing crisis,

205
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,160
should be the ones who ensure that tenants aren't losing money, not only by paying their rent,

206
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:43,040
but by paying extortionate energy bills for leaky flats and poor energy performance.

207
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:49,440
But of course, if you add on these costs to landlords, costs that many would argue are actually

208
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:57,440
just, you know, basic provisions that make somewhere livable, landlords apparently decide

209
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,160
that they don't want to rent their homes out anymore. So what's the solution to that?

210
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,960
Well, this is, I mean, I sort of take them at their word. And this is exactly what happened in

211
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:12,960
the previous century, that where it became unprofitable to be a landlord, they sold up.

212
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,560
And that was generally seemed to be a good thing, because it means more owner occupiers.

213
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,520
It means more ability for local authorities to buy properties and repurpose them or redevelop

214
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,840
them as council tenancies. And it just means people like more people living in better forms of

215
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,800
tenure than the private rented sector, which is by far the worst.

216
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,640
Do you think that councils would want to repurchase private property?

217
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,600
We know that they did. We know that they spent a lot of the 70s and 80s doing exactly that.

218
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,760
Of course, things are a bit different now. But I mean, local politicians fall over themselves to

219
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,080
promise more social housing. And if they were having to, if landlords were having to sell up

220
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,160
at bargain basement prices, it's a good opportunity for local authorities.

221
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,040
There's quite an interesting Lib Dem policy that came out a couple of months ago. That's

222
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:03,360
something that you don't hear very often, but that they wanted to devolve planning permission.

223
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,760
So they wanted to give local areas more opportunity to decide what is in their local area.

224
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:16,720
Do you think that councils would be able to purchase private property and make it into

225
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,480
social housing if local people were able to decide what those properties were going to be used for?

226
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,720
I mean, to be fair, in the last century, the way it worked was massive amounts of government

227
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,240
grants and public and public money. If the government was interested in doing that, then

228
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,040
I think they would probably have to fund it or at least change the way in which local authorities

229
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,680
can access public loans. But we know it can be done if there's a political will for it,

230
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:46,640
because it happened 50 years ago. Do you think that there is a political will for it or will

231
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,160
there be understarm? I know you said that he hasn't spoken much about housing, but can you imagine it

232
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,800
would be quite high up the agenda? I really hope that things will start to change. I really hope

233
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:03,200
that we start to remember the old wisdom that we had throughout the 20th century in terms of what's

234
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:11,200
called municipalisation, buying property of distressed landlords. I don't know if it will happen,

235
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,040
but what I think is hopeful is that we're now starting to remember, to have these conversations

236
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,640
again about how grubby and harmful the business of landlordism is, about how we have it within our

237
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,200
grasp to take property away from them and repurpose it if we really want to. It encourages me that

238
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720
this is suddenly a hot topic. This is something we're beginning to talk about again.

239
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,760
I know you'll probably ask this all the time, but for the sake of the tape, can you explain to me

240
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,640
what you mean by the grubby business of landlords? I think a lot of landlords see themselves as good

241
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,640
people, and I'm sure they probably are, but they are participating in an immensely harmful

242
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,200
economic system. They are profiting from an immensely harmful system, and the way I think of

243
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,560
it is it's a bit like people who use their phones while they're driving. Everyone seems to think

244
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:07,680
they have some particular and unique excuse, but when you think about it statistically at a social

245
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:14,320
level, we know that it's immensely dangerous, and anyone who is a landlord is not just profiting

246
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,760
they're profiting three times. They're getting the rental income, they're getting their mortgage

247
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,000
paid off, and they're getting capital gains. Even those landlords who think, well, I could be

248
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,920
charging more, they're doing extraordinarily well, and they're doing extraordinarily well

249
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,560
to everybody else's loss. It's really interesting, that phone analogy. Do you think landlords are

250
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:42,640
all landlording? Is it rooted in individualism? It is here, and that's a weird thing about Britain,

251
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,320
is that almost all of our landlords are just individual people. I think, again,

252
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,880
the old wisdom is worth discovering here, because throughout the 20th century, the landlord was

253
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,400
this figure of scorn, this really hated, reviled character, and there was a massive and deliberate

254
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,200
social change under Thatcher and Under Blair to reinvent the landlord instead of being this kind

255
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:12,480
of often violent, always unpalatable character, to be this sort of state-sanctioned, petty investor

256
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,720
and acceptable topic for the dinner table. And I think if we want to be serious about

257
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
reversing the housing crisis, we've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again. We've

258
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,880
got to rediscover a sense of shame and a sense of direct participation in the harm that we see

259
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,920
around us today. I've heard jokes before that landlords used to be hung out of windows.

260
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,840
I don't like... Not physically, sorry, by their feet, just to be clear.

261
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:45,280
Yeah, well, more often it was landlords doing the violence. I'm not a fan of kind of chauvinist

262
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:53,040
language around landlords. I think it can lead to some nasty things. I do think

263
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,560
I do think they ought to be embarrassed. I do think they ought to be ridiculed. It really

264
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:05,280
fascinates me that whenever there is sort of a protest or a direct action about a landlord,

265
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,800
they seem to think that they're entitled to respect. And I just feel that the law is on their

266
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,800
side, economics is on their side, the politicians are on their side, the courts are on their side.

267
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,680
The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them and make them feel ashamed is laughable.

268
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,400
Why do you think all of those... Well, all of those that you've just listed,

269
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,760
why are they on the side of landlords? Well, we're in a dangerous situation where

270
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,960
the argument of the book is that the housing market more broadly is rooted in profitable

271
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,720
landlordism. What generates the vast house prices is the idea that if you're selling your house,

272
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,440
you have to sell it to someone who may or may not be a landlord. So anyone buying it would have to

273
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:51,120
at least compete with a landlord who's able to command these extravagant rents. So the

274
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,640
rented sector is intimately tied in to the housing market more broadly. The government really,

275
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,720
really, really can't have the housing market failed because it's destroyed a system of pensions,

276
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,440
it's destroyed a system of social care, it's presided over a system of wage restraint,

277
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,960
and house prices for an awful lot of people are the only kind of stability they have,

278
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:18,400
the only kind of economic well-being they have. So a direct attack on landlordism is a much

279
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,760
broader attack on the housing economy more broadly. So it's dangerous territory to be in.

280
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,160
And I think if you don't want to be cynical about it and simply say, oh, well,

281
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
the MPs are all landlords and they're all in each other's pockets, if you want to be more

282
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,600
generous than the interpretation is, they know that Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism,

283
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,720
and that's a dangerous place to be in. But that's really interesting because then as the number of

284
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:52,160
renters grow every single year, you've created a two-tier society there. You've got an asset

285
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,400
class who are able to, what you're talking about, you know, social care, adult social care,

286
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,360
they're going to be able to fund that, they're going to have a pension in that, then you're going

287
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,640
to have an entire cohort of people who physically can't do it. Is that not going to be more expensive

288
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,400
for the state in the long term? Not only can they not do it, but of course they're paying for the

289
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,120
social care of their landlords and then property owners. It is something of a zero-sum game and

290
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,160
it's right that the bigger this phenomenon of landlordism becomes, the more people the state

291
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,960
is going to have to look after. The irony being, of course, they dismantled that system in the

292
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,760
first place and replaced it with one of property rights and it's coming back to bite them.

293
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,160
That feels like the state has gotten larger then.

294
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,680
The housing benefit bill certainly got larger. What the state is doing with its money seems to

295
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,720
be a lot less. It seems like so much money is just averted straight from taxes to

296
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
other people's mortgages, not the people's pockets.

297
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,880
When we look at councils and the number of councils that are going bankrupt at the moment,

298
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,200
how much of that do you think is linked to the increased pressures that they're facing with

299
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,600
housing? Well, the councils themselves are being incredibly honest about that and saying we can't

300
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,280
afford to house our homeless populations, we can't afford to meet the temporary accommodation costs we

301
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:11,520
have, and we can't afford to replenish our social housing stocks. Housing and social care is obviously

302
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:16,960
one of the biggest items of local authority spending. It blows my mind that if we wanted to,

303
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,200
we could just sort that out with rent controls and we choose not to. We choose to let local

304
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,960
authorities go bust instead. I just want to go back to a bit of the theory that you've got in

305
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,320
the book. You talk about Karl Marx and Adam Smith and you link them and you say that both of them

306
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,520
would not like the current housing system that we have. Can you tell me why?

307
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,400
Well, Marx and Smith both argued and it's traditionally been true on the right that

308
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,920
landlordism is not a good thing. It's not a profitable economic activity. It's a pure drag

309
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,120
on social production. It's taking away wealth that was created by other people.

310
00:25:54,160 --> 00:26:00,000
That was a wisdom that held true for a very long time and I think we've mentioned in the 1970s,

311
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,720
this kind of very relaxed attitude towards the collapse of the private rented sector.

312
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,520
And it's us who are living in this really weird political moment where the right supports landlords.

313
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,400
You would think that the right would be interested in lower state spending and you would think that

314
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,040
they would be interested in lower wage bills and successful businesses. Instead, they seem to

315
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,800
be very interested in property development, fine, but that seems to be intimately tied

316
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,360
up with landlordism as well. So they find themselves coming out to bat for landlords

317
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,680
in the name of property development, but that carries with it the idea that the state should

318
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:45,200
carry on spending all this money on housing benefit, diverting all of his tax and these wages

319
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,200
to the already wealthy. To make a crass argument off the back of that, you could say I didn't think

320
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,360
that the right liked benefits grounders. There you go. Exactly. Which is what you're essentially

321
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,520
saying that they are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yes, the entire housing benefit bill

322
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,240
that goes to the private sector is your right, a form of benefits grounding.

323
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:11,520
It's extraordinary. We touched on Margaret Thatcher earlier. Can you tell me how important

324
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:16,960
right to buy was in creating some of the issues that we have now? Yeah, I think it's really sad.

325
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,480
I think if I happen to be running a nice local authority and I wanted to build council housing,

326
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,040
I probably wouldn't bother because we saw this week the news that this beautiful,

327
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:32,160
a war-winning scheme in Norwich, an awful lot of it has been sold off under the right to buy within

328
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,920
three years of its life. And what is the earthly point of investing massive amount of public resources

329
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:45,280
in a social generational good if it's going to disappear and be repurposed as a sort of private

330
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:51,200
gain within years of its existence? And you have this idea that the state's already paid full of

331
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,400
this stuff once. It's built it. It's built it as a social good. And it's now paying for it again

332
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,840
in the form of repurposed right to buy flats, being re-letters, private, often temporary

333
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,200
accommodation at extortionate rates. So what do you do about that? Do you get rid of right to buy?

334
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,920
Would you have never done the scheme in the first place? I don't think abolishing right to buy

335
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,680
should be remotely controversial. I don't think it's controversial in Scotland where it's already

336
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:19,360
happened. It's a real, like, fringe demand to keep right to buy in place, or at least it should be.

337
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,760
You know, you should be embarrassed to stand up and say, I think public assets should be sold off

338
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,840
in perpetuity and that the state pay for them over and over again in the form of rents.

339
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,480
You see, you don't hear it from that side of it too often because it's normally a very

340
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:40,240
emotive argument, you know, that a man has a right to own his own home. And it's always

341
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,400
sold as a sort of like, you know, it's actually sort of as a bit of a fairytale actually.

342
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,560
What should we change sort of like our whole relationship with how we view houses and how

343
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,000
we view ownership? Well, I think the idea of selling off right to buy for emotional reasons is a

344
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,960
nice idea if you can afford it. But I mean, both parties keep telling us that there isn't a magic

345
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,000
money tree. They can't afford to keep right to buy in place. Can we talk a little bit about the

346
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,720
legislation in Europe? I love talking about legislation. Well, do you know, actually,

347
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,920
they like hearing about legislation and talking about the sort of things that sort of regulations

348
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,040
in Europe or legislation that you would be in favour of implementing here? Yeah, again, it's

349
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,200
worth pointing out just how weird Britain is. I mean, you go to almost any city in Europe.

350
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:33,440
They have more or less some form of rent control. Some are weaker, some are stronger. The rent

351
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,200
controls that exist in Ireland aren't particularly strong. The rent controls that exist in Germany

352
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,280
are much stronger. But we're in this very, very weird place where we don't have any limit on how

353
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:49,200
much landlords can try to extract from tenants. So I'm not, for the time being, I'm not hugely

354
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,280
fussed about what we steal, what we borrow and what we implement here, as long as we do something,

355
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:58,800
we can improve it in the future. But take any system you want and bring it here or restore

356
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,760
the one that we had here that works so well for the best part of the 20th century.

357
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,840
What would be your, if you had one pick, one bit of legislation that you could implement tomorrow

358
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,960
that even ported in from Europe, what would it be? Well, it has to be some form of rent control.

359
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,280
It is a broad social good. It makes people's lives less miserable. It makes people's lives

360
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,200
more affordable. The only people that doesn't benefit is landlords. And I think we can all

361
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,960
agree that's that we're comfortable with that. Would you get rid of landlording if you could?

362
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,040
You know, it's not a case of abolishing it. You can't pass the Landlord Abolition Act 2024,

363
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,360
but what you can do... I don't think you're thinking big enough.

364
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,880
The point is that the state works in more discreet ways, but it can abolish landlords and

365
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,560
it does abolish landlords. And that was the really interesting point about the 70s was that

366
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,760
landlords weren't just declining and they weren't just dwindling, but the scale at which they were

367
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,560
dwindling was accelerating. And that was to do with state policy. That was to do with high

368
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,200
interest rates and rent controls, which meant that it was just simply a bad idea to be a landlord.

369
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,520
You couldn't make any money doing it. So you de-incentivise it as an economic activity.

370
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,760
Smith would disagree that it is an economic activity, but however you do it, the state

371
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,800
through its policies can generate a system in which landlordism fails. And I think that would

372
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,640
be a good thing. I know you touched upon it earlier, but do you think there is a way to be

373
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:33,200
an ethical landlord? No. I think... Under current circumstances, it's not possible.

374
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,880
Even if you're letting below the market rent, you're still charging some of the

375
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,480
highest rental prices in Europe. You could effectively treat yourself as a local authority

376
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,680
and grant a legally secure tenancy. But the point I mentioned a moment ago that even the

377
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,000
landlord who comes trying to fix the mold, the tenant doesn't necessarily know. The tenant would

378
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,240
have to take them at their word. And when the landlord has the absolute right to evict you for

379
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,760
any reason or none, they can paint themselves as generously as they'd like. But ultimately,

380
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,400
they have immense power over the tenant and they could choose to wield it or not. And that's not

381
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:15,920
a healthy situation to be in. How do we get back to the 70s style of landlording that you're in

382
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:22,640
favour of without increasing supply? Well, I think that the 70s style of landlording was

383
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,920
very bad. I mean, they were awful landlords, but the point was that they were much fewer often.

384
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,880
Far, far fewer people were being subjected to the harm of the private rented sector. It's not

385
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,960
difficult to replicate the system of laws that was in place in the 1970s. And of course, when you

386
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,320
depress land values, you make it much, much easier for local authorities to build social housing.

387
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,080
The biggest barrier they face at the moment, as well as the looming right to buy threat,

388
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,680
is how do we get hold of land and how do we build on it? Because at the moment,

389
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,720
they're competing with Barrett homes, they're competing with

390
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,640
the people who are destroying elephant and castle lendlies. And local authorities just

391
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,960
don't have the purchasing power. Whereas if you make that kind of speculative price-increasing

392
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:11,920
redevelopment unprofitable, suddenly the local authorities the biggest player in town.

393
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,320
I mean, a lot of those big housing companies that you just spoke about there,

394
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,400
a lot of the time, if you speak to anyone who works high up there,

395
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:24,160
they actually say their work is very unprofitable. They say that their margins are very slim.

396
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,320
And I'm sure that's true. I'm sure that's true. And it shows just how easy it would be to drive

397
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,840
them out of business if we wanted to. Looking ahead, I mean, there's been a sharp increase in

398
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,560
the number of millennials who are renting. But millennials are also expected to be, well,

399
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,560
well, they will be part of the asset class quite soon, actually. Can you imagine that

400
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,760
those millennials, do you think that they would have been turned off of landlording

401
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,160
from their own experience? Or do you think that, I don't know, maybe the human condition doesn't

402
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:05,760
there? I take your point. I think that depends an awful lot on the mood music that we create.

403
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,720
As a society, I think the way part of the way in which landlordism was made acceptable was by these

404
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,240
TV programs that were just endlessly on in the 2000s about about playing the property game

405
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,560
and how gentle they made it look, how acceptable they made it look. And if we rediscover a sense

406
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,840
of refulsion, if we replace those with TV programs about just how horrible it feels when you don't

407
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:37,440
know if the landlord is going to kick you out or fix the mold for your own benefit, I would hope

408
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,240
that people take that sense of shame on board and choose not to. But fundamentally,

409
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:50,880
I wouldn't like there to be a situation in which it's the choice of that generation. I would prefer

410
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,400
to create the conditions in which it isn't profitable for them to be landlords, in which it

411
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,200
makes no sense for them to be landlords, and that they should sell up either to someone who's going

412
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,520
to live in the house themselves or to someone who's going to do something more socially productive

413
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,520
with it, like repurpose it as social housing. It's become quite popular again. It's not just

414
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,960
those early 2000s programs, but it's popular again on social media. Yeah, I think it never

415
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,200
really went away. And some of them, they're just really bleak to watch. I think the original

416
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,960
dream of these programs was that you looked around your dream home and everyone felt good about it,

417
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,480
but now the host says, oh, what are you going to do with it? And they say, I'll just put a coat of

418
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,320
paint on it and let it out. And the fact that you can go on TV and say that without,

419
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,360
without feeling an enormous sense of shame is a very unhealthy sign.

420
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:37,840
Yeah. I mean, even on, I mean, I think I was watching something on TikTok just the other day.

421
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:43,280
It was a girl who must have been about 28. She was explaining how you could make a home into an HMO.

422
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:53,520
Yeah. Yeah. It's revolting. And when we had what was called the Rackman scandal in this country,

423
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:00,800
this scandal of violent thuggery in the private rented sector, there was a kind of moment of

424
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,880
national shame around the idea of landlordism. And one of the biggest landlords at the time

425
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,760
was the church, which sold off an awful lot of its stock because it didn't like the aesthetic of

426
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,160
being a landlord. So again, these are all things that we have done in the past. It's well within

427
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,000
our grasp to do it again. People should be ashamed to make TikToks and say, this is how you make an

428
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,120
HMO. Through shame. The church sold it off through shame. Well, it was embarrassing. It was, it was

429
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,960
also unprofitable. But for a variety of factors, the church, yet massively decreased its private,

430
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,720
private landlord practice. How realistic is that ambition going to be in, well, either of our,

431
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,240
well, near lifetimes? I think, I think it really is up to us. I think your right to point out that

432
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,960
the millennial experience is very different. And the generation below us is very different. And I

433
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,880
think there is a culmination of a sense of unfairness and rage. Because what the economic

434
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,520
purpose that our generation has served is to take all of our income and pass it on to already wealthy,

435
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:09,680
older people. And at a certain point, that the anger at that situation begins to dominate at a

436
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:14,080
certain point, the foolishness of that situation begins to dominate. And I don't think it's out

437
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:20,240
of the realm of possibility that, you know, as people who are in their 30s become, you know,

438
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,520
the ones who are running the Labour Party and important in government, the common sense,

439
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,200
there's a sudden outbreak of common sense. And everyone says, this is a stupid system.

440
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,720
It's plagued me my entire life. I will not have it plagued the next generation.

441
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,840
So you're hopeful for it? Yeah. And I think the renters unions are being so good at the moment.

442
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:45,040
I think housing campaigns are being so good at the moment, and capturing that nascent

443
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,240
resistance, that sense of this is wrong, and purposing it towards landlords. So I think

444
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,960
the energy is there, and the will is there, all we need to do is sort of consolidate it,

445
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,840
make sure it's pointed at the right people. And yeah, I would be very surprised if we come back

446
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:06,320
here in five years time, and we say, well, we've just kept the system of landlordism going. We've

447
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,320
done nothing to address it. I mean, even the Conservative Party is passing a renters reform

448
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,120
bill. Well, there's even quite a strong Conservative group as well. I think it's priced out. It's

449
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:19,520
called, isn't it? Yeah. They're not, they're not fans of me, and I'm not a fan of them.

450
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,360
Oh, no. Why? Is it the Marxism? It's the Marxism. It's the, I mean, what, what they do is they kind

451
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,240
of confect this debate about Yimbees and Yimbees. They say it's all to do with supply. And if you

452
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,680
are not a property development type, then you want to make the housing crisis worse. And it's

453
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,760
very effective with discourse. It's very effective at backing people into a corner and saying, well,

454
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,160
I'm a good guy. So I must be a Yimbe. And I just think this is a false argument to have.

455
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,760
They won over a lot of politicians. They won over a lot of influential people. But I think what I

456
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,120
would encourage your viewers to do is to question their logic, question their rhetoric, question

457
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:00,080
their data, and say, can you really convince me that there's a supply problem? Or do we solve the

458
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,560
housing crisis by the methods that were successful in the 20th century through regulation, through

459
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,720
rent controls, and through making landlords is a less profitable activity.

460
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,320
But I mean, is there any hope of anyone in the Conservative Party introducing more legislation,

461
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:22,320
more regulation? You know, it's historically true that Conservatives haven't like landlords,

462
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,800
as you pointed out, I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that Tories will say,

463
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,640
that's enough state spending on landlords now. Let's try and unwind it.

464
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:39,040
That's the sell. I can see that. Yeah, I think that and wage bills. But of course,

465
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:44,800
landlordism is so wrapped up with home ownership that at the moment, the bigger concern in their

466
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,120
mind is keeping home ownership going. And they seem to be willing to spend enormous amounts of

467
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,280
public money in the form of housing benefits to make sure that the home ownership system remains

468
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,400
in place. Thank you very much for coming in. It's been a real pleasure.
