0	5120	a lot of landlords see themselves as good people. They are participating in an immensely harmful
5920	10000	economic system. We've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again. We've got to
10000	15280	rediscover a sense of shame and a sense of direct participation in the harm that we see around us
15280	21040	today. They seem to think that they're entitled to respect and I just feel that like the law is on
21040	24400	their side, economics is on their side, the politicians are on their side, the courts are on
24400	29600	their side. The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them and make them feel ashamed is
29600	33440	laughable. Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism and that's a dangerous place to be in.
33440	37040	Nick Banno, hi, welcome to Politics Show. Thanks so much for having me, great to be here.
37040	40320	Yeah, well thank you for coming. How would you like to introduce yourself?
40320	45760	I am a housing lawyer specialising in legal aid housing work. I've also got a bit of a background
45760	50960	in more street politics kind of things and have an interest in a Marxist understanding of
51760	56160	political economy. Is that the impetus behind this book? Yeah, I just felt like a lot of the
56800	61040	writing we were seeing about housing used some Marxist concepts a bit loosely and I wanted to
61040	66640	get really under the hood of the housing crisis and see how it works from a kind of particularly
66640	72800	Marxist perspective. I could ask you a really, really broad question. In broad terms, what do you
72800	81120	mean by that? By a Marxist perspective. Yeah. Well, classical economists, neoclassical economists
81680	88000	see the role of economics as the allocation of scarce resources and Marx opens capital by saying
88000	92160	we live in a world that has so much stuff in it. There is so many commodities in the world.
92160	96480	How is it that everyone is poor? So he starts from a place of abundance and he tries to work out
96480	100480	what the forces are in the world that make us live lives of misery and struggle in a world
100480	104640	that produces so much and this takes a vaguely similar approach to housing and it says not
104640	109840	only is there so much housing in Britain but there's an awful lot of housing wealth and how is
109920	113520	it that when there's all this money and all these homes, we live in cities that are packed with
113520	118800	gunnels with homes? How is it that all of us living in housing poverty and in very, very bad
118800	124240	conditions? Is that why you've just written for The Guardian about how we don't need more supply?
124240	128560	Yeah, it really touched a nerve that the supply issue is really kind of a throwaway line in the
128560	134320	book. I just have this quick justification of why I'm not talking about supply but I feel that
134320	139440	supply has dominated the discourse for so long that people found it really surprising. A lot of
139440	143760	people found it quite upsetting and shocking that you challenged the accepted wisdom that you kind
143760	150880	of put the property developers to proof that there is this massive shortage because that's not
150880	155360	really what the stats bear out if we look at Britain in historical terms or if we look at the UK
155920	161520	in comparative international terms. But I mean, you know, the short I suppose that accepted
161520	166480	wisdom is because you would think that with more supply that would I suppose liquidate
166480	170640	the market and make the housing stock more affordable? Isn't that not true?
170640	175440	Well, that's the thinking. I think it's difficult to find a great deal of evidence for that.
175440	179840	If it does work like that, then the amount of surplus you'd need to build to have any meaningful
179840	184720	impact on price would be staggering. And given that the planet is dying and given that there are
184720	189920	other ways of doing it, given that we can regulate a housing market out of crisis, then it seems to me
189920	197280	dangerous to obsess ourselves with the idea of supply, to build a vast surplus when we don't
197280	201840	need to, when we can just tweak a few legal and economic levers and get ourselves out of it that
201840	208080	way. Talk to me about regulating the prices down. Yeah, so in most countries and most sensible
208080	213680	places around the world, landlords don't have a complete free reign to work out what they can
213680	218160	extract from tenants without physically killing them. In most places around the world, there's
218160	223520	some sort of cap or break or regulation that governs the way in which rental markets work.
223520	227360	And of course, historically, that was the case here too, but it was completely destroyed
228000	235520	in the late 80s and early 90s. So we're quite unusual in not having any form of rent regulation.
235520	239200	And one of the things that lots of us are campaigning for is to restore it
239200	243920	with the hope that that would restore ourselves to something like a pre-crisis state of affairs.
243920	248160	Because this landmark policy is going to be introduced in Scotland. Yes.
248160	253680	But the accepted wisdom of that down here is that that actually drives up prices.
254640	258640	I don't know if that's the accepted wisdom. I think it's said a lot. I think it's said an awful
258640	264640	lot. And I think it's true that rent controls can be done badly, but that's not a conceptual
264640	269040	problem with rent controls. If it were the case that rent controls were generally bad,
269040	271840	then they would have been abolished in every country in Europe when, of course,
271920	276080	they tend to be present in most European countries where there are problems with
276080	279600	implementing rent controls. They can be fixed. We can make things better.
279600	283920	But the idea that a particular policy is leading to problems and therefore
283920	288640	we just need to let the free market run rampant in Scottish housing is bizarre to me.
288640	291920	I mean, so in layman's terms, feel free to talk to me like an idiot.
293680	299120	If you're going to set a period of time in which rents cannot rise, is that not going to give way
299680	302480	to landlords just pushing up the prices to start with?
302480	305840	It might. But then, of course, that's a short-term pain for a much longer-term
306400	311120	public benefit. And I also think that all of these scarce stories we hear about rent controls
311120	314720	generally paint a picture of a world that's a lot better than the one we're currently living in,
314720	318880	like a lot of these these these healthscapes I would take over the present housing crisis
318880	323280	that so many people are suffering through. Right. What about, I mean, is there not a possibility
323280	328320	as well that, I mean, over the last couple of years, obviously, you know, well, after COVID,
328320	334960	we've seen a sharp rise, a ridiculous rise in rents, particularly in London, in Manchester,
334960	340720	and even actually suburban towns. But is there not a chance that rents are going to come down
340720	346560	by themselves? Well, the class of landlords is not known for being generous and unself-interested.
346560	352000	They're, of course, assisted by letting agents whose only job it is to tell them, look,
352000	355680	this is what we think the market will tolerate. This is what you can get out of this property.
355680	361120	So it would be surprising if landlords acted against their own self-interest by saying,
361120	365920	I'm going to undercut and go below the market rent. So there's a chain then that's driving
366480	373040	rents at the moment? There are structural forces at work. I think when a landlord buys a rental
373040	378800	property, baked into that sale price is the idea that the rent will keep on rising. That's what
378800	383120	makes it valuable to them. So when a landlord says, I'm not going to put the rent up in line with
383120	388640	the market, I'm going to keep it low, that signals or contributes to the idea that it wasn't worth
388640	393120	the purchase price in the first place. It signals or contributes to the idea that the next landlord
393120	396880	who wants to buy it is not making a very good investment because, in fact, the rent it's currently
396880	402560	generating is lower. So there's a structural impetus on landlords to raise the rent. It
402560	406800	justifies the purchase price of their product. It's not just mean people saying, we want to
406800	412960	drive people further into poverty. So going back to what you were talking about before then,
412960	419440	you were talking about how supply is not driving house prices. I mean, is it landlords?
419440	425440	What is the root cause? What is driving? The market's argument is that rents in cities are
425440	430000	what he calls monopoly prices. So it's the highest price that will be tolerated under
430000	435920	given social circumstances without physically driving the class of tenants out of existence.
435920	440080	And what landlords have been doing over the past few decades is realizing and developing their
440160	445680	economic power. And what seems to be happening at the moment is landlords are realizing that
445680	451280	they can just say, do you know what? There is a fee for viewing. And they say it and it becomes
451280	455680	true. It's not that there's suddenly a massive structural adjustment in the number of people
455680	460640	or the number of homes. It's landlords demonstrating the economic power they have over us. They make
460640	464560	a demand, they see if we meet it. And when we do, they say, that is the reality now.
465280	467760	But is that happening all over then?
468960	470080	It's certainly happening in London.
470800	474240	They're charging for viewing or am I sorry, did I just misinterpret that?
475680	479440	I've heard rumors about charging for viewings. I've heard rumors about bidding wars. I've heard
479440	484800	rumors about listed rents not being natural rent you pay. And of course, the more landlords
484800	490400	cotton onto this, the worse the problem becomes. Right. So we're creating a, we're creating our
490400	496240	entomies actually by giving into them. We don't really have a choice. We're not being generous
496240	500560	here. I mean, we really do need places to live. And if this is the demand that landlords make
500560	504080	of us, we don't really have a choice but to say, well, that's what I'll have to do.
504080	509840	Can you talk to me about state backed rent rising? So when you have these short life
509840	513600	tendencies, which dominate the private rented sector, where you have absolutely no security,
515280	518880	landlords are free to demand whatever rent they want. And when the state says,
519520	522960	this is the housing benefit. And by the way, I'm putting housing benefits up.
522960	528000	What the landlords can do is just generate that state spending into additional income for themselves.
528000	533680	They can raise the rents in line with housing benefit rises when there is no cap, when there is
533680	538480	no break. So you have this system where even the best intentioned policies of the state,
538480	543360	which are aims to kind of reduce poverty and to make people's lives easier, are just converted
543360	548480	into higher state spending on landlords, which of course is a massive problem for the tax bill.
548480	552720	And a massive benefit for landlords. So the taxpayer is subsidising landlords.
552720	555840	So the tune of billions of pounds, and it's a number that keeps coming up.
556480	559760	Makes me feel really good that. Yeah, well, you must be a landlord.
560400	567040	No, I mean, just I'm paying twice. Well, exactly. Yeah, exactly. It's the state that's paying.
567040	570080	It's obviously tenants that are paying and it's employers that are paying because obviously
570080	574720	wages in this country have to be sensationally high just so that people can meet their housing costs.
574800	579920	But also with housing benefit, a landlord doesn't have to take a tenant that is on housing benefit.
579920	583920	They can say that certain properties are exempt for some reason.
583920	589360	Well, in principle, they do because it tends to be unlawfully discriminatory to refuse to
589360	595040	take housing benefit tenants. But that tends to take brave and dogged tenants bringing legal
595040	599200	challenges. It's not very good at filtering through into the reality of the world. And we know that
599200	604400	it happens. You know that it happens a lot. But what you do have is the sort of base layer of
604400	611760	housing provision in Britain is met by housing benefit. That's the state kind of underwriting
611760	615280	the bottom of the housing market and everything else is built on top of that.
615280	620160	So as and when housing benefit rises and the lowest rents meet to rise to match those,
620160	623920	the higher up rents rise with it and it's a tide that seems to be lifting all ships.
623920	629040	So housing benefit is driving higher rents? In part, and obviously I'm not saying the state is
629040	632720	bad and the state should cut housing benefit, of course it shouldn't. But I do think it's
632720	636560	interesting to think about the way in which the state is tearing its hair out saying,
636560	639360	what are we going to do about the housing crisis? Well, at the same time,
639360	644160	just having this open checkbook and saying for us landlords can demand what they want and we
644160	648960	will just continue to pay. But what's the simple resolution to that then? Because I mean, when
648960	654560	you talk about supply or, you know, supply not being the answer, if there was a supply of homes
654560	659200	that were owned by the council, is that not a resolution to the housing benefit crisis?
659200	663600	Absolutely. And of course, housing benefit, housing, council tenants are rent capped,
663600	668720	housing tenants are rent controlled, same with social housing providers. If we did that in the
668720	673600	private rented sector, of course, state spending on housing would massively go down. You know,
673600	678640	I'm particularly concerned about the housing that's provided to homeless households, which are often
678640	684240	charged nightly, which are charged utterly exorbitant rates and many, many of them are in
684240	688960	buildings that the council had once built as council housing. So the state's paid for it once
688960	693440	and now it's continuing to pay for it over and over again in the form of private rents.
693440	697280	So this goes back to Margaret Thatcher? A lot of it does. It goes back to Margaret Thatcher and
697280	702320	to Tony Blair, because of course, while it's right to point out that Thatcher dismantled rent
702320	707280	controls, what kept the landlords in check for most of the 20th century was that they were scared
707280	712080	that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords, labor would come and turn it round again. And
712080	717280	when you have a long term investment like land, that tended to keep the landlords at bay a bit.
717280	722080	So when Tony Blair said rent controls are never coming back, I'm keeping what Thatcher has,
722080	728320	that signals to the landlords, you go wild, you go crazy. So what sort of signal is Keir Starmer
728960	733040	sending to landlords at the moment then? If you know, if we take the premise that perhaps he's
734400	739280	well, he's utilizing a bit of Blair? Well, I think he's being curiously quiet. And I think what's
739280	743680	interesting is that he, I mean, he's been outflanked on the Renters Rights Bill. I don't think it's a
743680	749840	policy he himself would have come up with. And he can't do very much better than the bill that
749840	755360	the Tories originally put forward. So he's not saying very much about housing. But what he is,
755360	760880	is nothing extraordinary, nothing remarkable compared to what any other politician is saying.
761840	767120	The Renters Reform Bill, I mean, it has dominated the new cycle, partly because it's
767120	771360	the only policy that is actually being put forward by the Conservatives at the moment.
772160	776960	And a lot of those, the original ideas have been watered down, and they have been relaxed.
776960	781040	But there is one little bit in there about Section 21, I find really interesting. And I was just
781040	786480	wondering, like, what's your interpretation of abolishing Section 21? When I saw the bill,
786480	791760	I thought it was surprisingly good. I think when the Tories were kind of forced into making this
791760	797120	pledge in the 2019 election manifesto, I think they thought it was quite a technical, fluffy,
797200	801840	family-friendly policy. I don't think they quite realized that Section 21 is one of the key
803440	808000	kind of cornerstones of the Thatcherite housing settlement. As I explained a minute ago, it's
808000	813440	what allows landlords to demand a higher rent whenever housing benefit goes up. So when you
813440	818320	abolish Section 21 and introduce that little bit more security, it becomes that much easier
818320	821440	with tenants to say, actually, I'm not paying this higher rent, you're going to have to go
821440	826640	through a legal process to raise it. So it should, it could have the effect of dampening
826640	830480	the kind of runaway pace of rent rises that we're used to seeing.
830480	834000	I think if it is abolished, it'll take some time to bed in because, of course,
834000	839760	it's been abolished in Scotland. And Scotland is still, Scottish tenants are finding their power
839760	843360	and Scottish landlords are realizing the loss of theirs. But those kind of
843360	846560	behavioral changes can take years, if not decades, to bed in.
846560	850560	Well, also, I mean, you know, there's a theoretical loss of power that could be
850560	855200	experienced by the landlord. But, you know, we've just, we've just spoken about housing benefit a
855200	860400	moment ago, and we said that, you know, even though they are landlords, don't take tenants
860400	865200	that, you know, have housing benefits, even though that they are legally required to. So,
865200	870320	I mean, will it actually, you know, will it give power back to tenants, do you think,
870320	876240	in actual practice? Because how many young people, especially in today's market, have the time
876880	879920	or the know-how to take a landlord to court?
879920	884080	Yeah. And of course, that's going to be the challenge that the housing movement faces.
884080	888560	It's going to be re-skilling a generation of renters as to their rights. But I do think it's
888560	893040	going to be crucial in terms of the number of people who don't complain to their landlords
893040	899440	about housing conditions because of section 21. It suddenly gives them a much safer environment
899440	904080	to do that, to say, you know, I pay you money for this service, you've got to fix the boiler,
904080	905520	you've got to fix the damp.
905520	910400	That's really interesting about not complaining, because it's true, isn't it? Most tenants don't
911200	914160	don't speak up because they are worried that they're going to be evicted.
914160	917920	I mean, I think it's true for all of us. I think we've all experienced it. And I think one of the
917920	923200	really weird and amazing things about the housing market here is that if your landlord comes round
923200	926960	and says, oh, there's a bit of a damp problem, I'm going to do something about that,
926960	931040	you genuinely don't know whether that's the landlord behaving themselves or the landlord
931040	936800	gearing up to evict you. So even if you have a nice landlord, you live under such a looming threat
936800	941920	that it wreaks havoc with people's sense of stability and their mental health and their
941920	944880	capacity to build their lives. It's a horrible situation.
945520	949280	Landlords don't really do too well with being told that they have to, you know,
949280	955040	with more regulations being slapped on them. I mean, a couple of years ago, we were talking about,
955040	959600	actually might have been last year, we were talking about energy efficiency and how all
959600	965360	properties now had to be energy efficient. You know, you couldn't have a single glazing or a
965360	971600	roof that allowed heat to evaporate. How did that increased regulation go down?
972160	977520	Well, yeah, it wasn't popular. And it's really interesting because I think a few years ago,
977520	983200	it would have been seen as something of a fringe issue. But with the massive rise in energy bills,
983200	987520	the energy performance of people's homes is life changing financial decisions.
987520	992400	And it's only fair that landlords should, the ones who benefit from the housing crisis,
992400	998160	should be the ones who ensure that tenants aren't losing money, not only by paying their rent,
998160	1003040	but by paying extortionate energy bills for leaky flats and poor energy performance.
1003040	1009440	But of course, if you add on these costs to landlords, costs that many would argue are actually
1009440	1017440	just, you know, basic provisions that make somewhere livable, landlords apparently decide
1017440	1022160	that they don't want to rent their homes out anymore. So what's the solution to that?
1022160	1026960	Well, this is, I mean, I sort of take them at their word. And this is exactly what happened in
1026960	1032960	the previous century, that where it became unprofitable to be a landlord, they sold up.
1032960	1036560	And that was generally seemed to be a good thing, because it means more owner occupiers.
1037200	1043520	It means more ability for local authorities to buy properties and repurpose them or redevelop
1043520	1047840	them as council tenancies. And it just means people like more people living in better forms of
1047840	1050800	tenure than the private rented sector, which is by far the worst.
1051360	1054640	Do you think that councils would want to repurchase private property?
1054640	1059600	We know that they did. We know that they spent a lot of the 70s and 80s doing exactly that.
1059600	1063760	Of course, things are a bit different now. But I mean, local politicians fall over themselves to
1063760	1068080	promise more social housing. And if they were having to, if landlords were having to sell up
1068080	1072160	at bargain basement prices, it's a good opportunity for local authorities.
1072160	1077040	There's quite an interesting Lib Dem policy that came out a couple of months ago. That's
1077040	1083360	something that you don't hear very often, but that they wanted to devolve planning permission.
1083360	1089760	So they wanted to give local areas more opportunity to decide what is in their local area.
1090560	1096720	Do you think that councils would be able to purchase private property and make it into
1096720	1102480	social housing if local people were able to decide what those properties were going to be used for?
1102480	1106720	I mean, to be fair, in the last century, the way it worked was massive amounts of government
1106720	1112240	grants and public and public money. If the government was interested in doing that, then
1112240	1117040	I think they would probably have to fund it or at least change the way in which local authorities
1117040	1121680	can access public loans. But we know it can be done if there's a political will for it,
1121680	1126640	because it happened 50 years ago. Do you think that there is a political will for it or will
1126640	1132160	there be understarm? I know you said that he hasn't spoken much about housing, but can you imagine it
1132160	1136800	would be quite high up the agenda? I really hope that things will start to change. I really hope
1136800	1143200	that we start to remember the old wisdom that we had throughout the 20th century in terms of what's
1143200	1151200	called municipalisation, buying property of distressed landlords. I don't know if it will happen,
1151200	1157040	but what I think is hopeful is that we're now starting to remember, to have these conversations
1157040	1162640	again about how grubby and harmful the business of landlordism is, about how we have it within our
1162640	1169200	grasp to take property away from them and repurpose it if we really want to. It encourages me that
1169200	1172720	this is suddenly a hot topic. This is something we're beginning to talk about again.
1172720	1177760	I know you'll probably ask this all the time, but for the sake of the tape, can you explain to me
1177760	1184640	what you mean by the grubby business of landlords? I think a lot of landlords see themselves as good
1184640	1190640	people, and I'm sure they probably are, but they are participating in an immensely harmful
1191440	1197200	economic system. They are profiting from an immensely harmful system, and the way I think of
1197200	1202560	it is it's a bit like people who use their phones while they're driving. Everyone seems to think
1202560	1207680	they have some particular and unique excuse, but when you think about it statistically at a social
1207680	1214320	level, we know that it's immensely dangerous, and anyone who is a landlord is not just profiting
1214400	1219760	they're profiting three times. They're getting the rental income, they're getting their mortgage
1219760	1224000	paid off, and they're getting capital gains. Even those landlords who think, well, I could be
1224000	1229920	charging more, they're doing extraordinarily well, and they're doing extraordinarily well
1229920	1236560	to everybody else's loss. It's really interesting, that phone analogy. Do you think landlords are
1236560	1242640	all landlording? Is it rooted in individualism? It is here, and that's a weird thing about Britain,
1242960	1248320	is that almost all of our landlords are just individual people. I think, again,
1248320	1252880	the old wisdom is worth discovering here, because throughout the 20th century, the landlord was
1252880	1258400	this figure of scorn, this really hated, reviled character, and there was a massive and deliberate
1258400	1263200	social change under Thatcher and Under Blair to reinvent the landlord instead of being this kind
1263200	1272480	of often violent, always unpalatable character, to be this sort of state-sanctioned, petty investor
1272720	1278720	and acceptable topic for the dinner table. And I think if we want to be serious about
1278720	1283200	reversing the housing crisis, we've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again. We've
1283200	1288880	got to rediscover a sense of shame and a sense of direct participation in the harm that we see
1288880	1293920	around us today. I've heard jokes before that landlords used to be hung out of windows.
1296240	1299840	I don't like... Not physically, sorry, by their feet, just to be clear.
1299840	1305280	Yeah, well, more often it was landlords doing the violence. I'm not a fan of kind of chauvinist
1305280	1313040	language around landlords. I think it can lead to some nasty things. I do think
1314080	1318560	I do think they ought to be embarrassed. I do think they ought to be ridiculed. It really
1318560	1325280	fascinates me that whenever there is sort of a protest or a direct action about a landlord,
1325280	1330800	they seem to think that they're entitled to respect. And I just feel that the law is on their
1330800	1334800	side, economics is on their side, the politicians are on their side, the courts are on their side.
1334800	1339680	The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them and make them feel ashamed is laughable.
1340320	1344400	Why do you think all of those... Well, all of those that you've just listed,
1344400	1349760	why are they on the side of landlords? Well, we're in a dangerous situation where
1349760	1354960	the argument of the book is that the housing market more broadly is rooted in profitable
1354960	1360720	landlordism. What generates the vast house prices is the idea that if you're selling your house,
1360720	1365440	you have to sell it to someone who may or may not be a landlord. So anyone buying it would have to
1365440	1371120	at least compete with a landlord who's able to command these extravagant rents. So the
1371120	1376640	rented sector is intimately tied in to the housing market more broadly. The government really,
1376640	1382720	really, really can't have the housing market failed because it's destroyed a system of pensions,
1382720	1387440	it's destroyed a system of social care, it's presided over a system of wage restraint,
1387440	1392960	and house prices for an awful lot of people are the only kind of stability they have,
1392960	1398400	the only kind of economic well-being they have. So a direct attack on landlordism is a much
1398400	1403760	broader attack on the housing economy more broadly. So it's dangerous territory to be in.
1403760	1408160	And I think if you don't want to be cynical about it and simply say, oh, well,
1409280	1413120	the MPs are all landlords and they're all in each other's pockets, if you want to be more
1413120	1419600	generous than the interpretation is, they know that Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism,
1419600	1424720	and that's a dangerous place to be in. But that's really interesting because then as the number of
1424720	1432160	renters grow every single year, you've created a two-tier society there. You've got an asset
1432160	1436400	class who are able to, what you're talking about, you know, social care, adult social care,
1436400	1439360	they're going to be able to fund that, they're going to have a pension in that, then you're going
1439360	1444640	to have an entire cohort of people who physically can't do it. Is that not going to be more expensive
1444640	1448400	for the state in the long term? Not only can they not do it, but of course they're paying for the
1448400	1453120	social care of their landlords and then property owners. It is something of a zero-sum game and
1453120	1458160	it's right that the bigger this phenomenon of landlordism becomes, the more people the state
1458160	1464960	is going to have to look after. The irony being, of course, they dismantled that system in the
1464960	1469760	first place and replaced it with one of property rights and it's coming back to bite them.
1469760	1472160	That feels like the state has gotten larger then.
1473360	1477680	The housing benefit bill certainly got larger. What the state is doing with its money seems to
1477680	1482720	be a lot less. It seems like so much money is just averted straight from taxes to
1483360	1485360	other people's mortgages, not the people's pockets.
1486320	1490880	When we look at councils and the number of councils that are going bankrupt at the moment,
1490880	1495200	how much of that do you think is linked to the increased pressures that they're facing with
1495200	1499600	housing? Well, the councils themselves are being incredibly honest about that and saying we can't
1499600	1505280	afford to house our homeless populations, we can't afford to meet the temporary accommodation costs we
1505280	1511520	have, and we can't afford to replenish our social housing stocks. Housing and social care is obviously
1511520	1516960	one of the biggest items of local authority spending. It blows my mind that if we wanted to,
1516960	1521200	we could just sort that out with rent controls and we choose not to. We choose to let local
1521200	1524960	authorities go bust instead. I just want to go back to a bit of the theory that you've got in
1524960	1530320	the book. You talk about Karl Marx and Adam Smith and you link them and you say that both of them
1530320	1533520	would not like the current housing system that we have. Can you tell me why?
1534000	1540400	Well, Marx and Smith both argued and it's traditionally been true on the right that
1540400	1545920	landlordism is not a good thing. It's not a profitable economic activity. It's a pure drag
1546640	1553120	on social production. It's taking away wealth that was created by other people.
1554160	1560000	That was a wisdom that held true for a very long time and I think we've mentioned in the 1970s,
1560000	1564720	this kind of very relaxed attitude towards the collapse of the private rented sector.
1564720	1571520	And it's us who are living in this really weird political moment where the right supports landlords.
1572800	1576400	You would think that the right would be interested in lower state spending and you would think that
1576400	1583040	they would be interested in lower wage bills and successful businesses. Instead, they seem to
1583040	1590800	be very interested in property development, fine, but that seems to be intimately tied
1590800	1595360	up with landlordism as well. So they find themselves coming out to bat for landlords
1595360	1599680	in the name of property development, but that carries with it the idea that the state should
1599680	1605200	carry on spending all this money on housing benefit, diverting all of his tax and these wages
1605200	1611200	to the already wealthy. To make a crass argument off the back of that, you could say I didn't think
1611200	1615360	that the right liked benefits grounders. There you go. Exactly. Which is what you're essentially
1615360	1619520	saying that they are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yes, the entire housing benefit bill
1620480	1624240	that goes to the private sector is your right, a form of benefits grounding.
1624240	1631520	It's extraordinary. We touched on Margaret Thatcher earlier. Can you tell me how important
1631520	1636960	right to buy was in creating some of the issues that we have now? Yeah, I think it's really sad.
1636960	1642480	I think if I happen to be running a nice local authority and I wanted to build council housing,
1642480	1647040	I probably wouldn't bother because we saw this week the news that this beautiful,
1647040	1652160	a war-winning scheme in Norwich, an awful lot of it has been sold off under the right to buy within
1652160	1657920	three years of its life. And what is the earthly point of investing massive amount of public resources
1657920	1665280	in a social generational good if it's going to disappear and be repurposed as a sort of private
1665280	1671200	gain within years of its existence? And you have this idea that the state's already paid full of
1671200	1676400	this stuff once. It's built it. It's built it as a social good. And it's now paying for it again
1676400	1681840	in the form of repurposed right to buy flats, being re-letters, private, often temporary
1681840	1687200	accommodation at extortionate rates. So what do you do about that? Do you get rid of right to buy?
1687200	1689920	Would you have never done the scheme in the first place? I don't think abolishing right to buy
1689920	1693680	should be remotely controversial. I don't think it's controversial in Scotland where it's already
1693680	1699360	happened. It's a real, like, fringe demand to keep right to buy in place, or at least it should be.
1699360	1703760	You know, you should be embarrassed to stand up and say, I think public assets should be sold off
1703760	1707840	in perpetuity and that the state pay for them over and over again in the form of rents.
1708400	1712480	You see, you don't hear it from that side of it too often because it's normally a very
1712480	1720240	emotive argument, you know, that a man has a right to own his own home. And it's always
1720240	1724400	sold as a sort of like, you know, it's actually sort of as a bit of a fairytale actually.
1725520	1730560	What should we change sort of like our whole relationship with how we view houses and how
1730560	1736000	we view ownership? Well, I think the idea of selling off right to buy for emotional reasons is a
1736000	1740960	nice idea if you can afford it. But I mean, both parties keep telling us that there isn't a magic
1740960	1748000	money tree. They can't afford to keep right to buy in place. Can we talk a little bit about the
1748000	1752720	legislation in Europe? I love talking about legislation. Well, do you know, actually,
1752720	1757920	they like hearing about legislation and talking about the sort of things that sort of regulations
1757920	1763040	in Europe or legislation that you would be in favour of implementing here? Yeah, again, it's
1763040	1767200	worth pointing out just how weird Britain is. I mean, you go to almost any city in Europe.
1767840	1773440	They have more or less some form of rent control. Some are weaker, some are stronger. The rent
1773440	1777200	controls that exist in Ireland aren't particularly strong. The rent controls that exist in Germany
1777200	1783280	are much stronger. But we're in this very, very weird place where we don't have any limit on how
1783280	1789200	much landlords can try to extract from tenants. So I'm not, for the time being, I'm not hugely
1789200	1793280	fussed about what we steal, what we borrow and what we implement here, as long as we do something,
1793280	1798800	we can improve it in the future. But take any system you want and bring it here or restore
1798800	1801760	the one that we had here that works so well for the best part of the 20th century.
1802000	1807840	What would be your, if you had one pick, one bit of legislation that you could implement tomorrow
1807840	1812960	that even ported in from Europe, what would it be? Well, it has to be some form of rent control.
1813600	1819280	It is a broad social good. It makes people's lives less miserable. It makes people's lives
1819280	1823200	more affordable. The only people that doesn't benefit is landlords. And I think we can all
1823200	1826960	agree that's that we're comfortable with that. Would you get rid of landlording if you could?
1827920	1833040	You know, it's not a case of abolishing it. You can't pass the Landlord Abolition Act 2024,
1833040	1835360	but what you can do... I don't think you're thinking big enough.
1836960	1840880	The point is that the state works in more discreet ways, but it can abolish landlords and
1840880	1844560	it does abolish landlords. And that was the really interesting point about the 70s was that
1846240	1851760	landlords weren't just declining and they weren't just dwindling, but the scale at which they were
1851760	1856560	dwindling was accelerating. And that was to do with state policy. That was to do with high
1856560	1861200	interest rates and rent controls, which meant that it was just simply a bad idea to be a landlord.
1861200	1867520	You couldn't make any money doing it. So you de-incentivise it as an economic activity.
1867520	1871760	Smith would disagree that it is an economic activity, but however you do it, the state
1871760	1876800	through its policies can generate a system in which landlordism fails. And I think that would
1876800	1880640	be a good thing. I know you touched upon it earlier, but do you think there is a way to be
1880640	1893200	an ethical landlord? No. I think... Under current circumstances, it's not possible.
1895440	1898880	Even if you're letting below the market rent, you're still charging some of the
1898880	1904480	highest rental prices in Europe. You could effectively treat yourself as a local authority
1904480	1909680	and grant a legally secure tenancy. But the point I mentioned a moment ago that even the
1909680	1914000	landlord who comes trying to fix the mold, the tenant doesn't necessarily know. The tenant would
1914000	1918240	have to take them at their word. And when the landlord has the absolute right to evict you for
1918240	1923760	any reason or none, they can paint themselves as generously as they'd like. But ultimately,
1924400	1928400	they have immense power over the tenant and they could choose to wield it or not. And that's not
1928400	1935920	a healthy situation to be in. How do we get back to the 70s style of landlording that you're in
1935920	1942640	favour of without increasing supply? Well, I think that the 70s style of landlording was
1942640	1945920	very bad. I mean, they were awful landlords, but the point was that they were much fewer often.
1946560	1952880	Far, far fewer people were being subjected to the harm of the private rented sector. It's not
1952880	1958960	difficult to replicate the system of laws that was in place in the 1970s. And of course, when you
1958960	1964320	depress land values, you make it much, much easier for local authorities to build social housing.
1964320	1968080	The biggest barrier they face at the moment, as well as the looming right to buy threat,
1968080	1971680	is how do we get hold of land and how do we build on it? Because at the moment,
1971680	1974720	they're competing with Barrett homes, they're competing with
1976400	1980640	the people who are destroying elephant and castle lendlies. And local authorities just
1980640	1986960	don't have the purchasing power. Whereas if you make that kind of speculative price-increasing
1987680	1991920	redevelopment unprofitable, suddenly the local authorities the biggest player in town.
1992800	1996320	I mean, a lot of those big housing companies that you just spoke about there,
1996320	2000400	a lot of the time, if you speak to anyone who works high up there,
2000400	2004160	they actually say their work is very unprofitable. They say that their margins are very slim.
2004160	2008320	And I'm sure that's true. I'm sure that's true. And it shows just how easy it would be to drive
2008320	2015840	them out of business if we wanted to. Looking ahead, I mean, there's been a sharp increase in
2015840	2022560	the number of millennials who are renting. But millennials are also expected to be, well,
2023200	2028560	well, they will be part of the asset class quite soon, actually. Can you imagine that
2029440	2033760	those millennials, do you think that they would have been turned off of landlording
2033760	2038160	from their own experience? Or do you think that, I don't know, maybe the human condition doesn't
2038160	2045760	there? I take your point. I think that depends an awful lot on the mood music that we create.
2046000	2052720	As a society, I think the way part of the way in which landlordism was made acceptable was by these
2053280	2058240	TV programs that were just endlessly on in the 2000s about about playing the property game
2058240	2064560	and how gentle they made it look, how acceptable they made it look. And if we rediscover a sense
2064560	2071840	of refulsion, if we replace those with TV programs about just how horrible it feels when you don't
2071840	2077440	know if the landlord is going to kick you out or fix the mold for your own benefit, I would hope
2077440	2084240	that people take that sense of shame on board and choose not to. But fundamentally,
2086160	2090880	I wouldn't like there to be a situation in which it's the choice of that generation. I would prefer
2090880	2094400	to create the conditions in which it isn't profitable for them to be landlords, in which it
2094400	2099200	makes no sense for them to be landlords, and that they should sell up either to someone who's going
2099200	2103520	to live in the house themselves or to someone who's going to do something more socially productive
2103520	2107520	with it, like repurpose it as social housing. It's become quite popular again. It's not just
2107520	2112960	those early 2000s programs, but it's popular again on social media. Yeah, I think it never
2112960	2117200	really went away. And some of them, they're just really bleak to watch. I think the original
2117200	2120960	dream of these programs was that you looked around your dream home and everyone felt good about it,
2120960	2124480	but now the host says, oh, what are you going to do with it? And they say, I'll just put a coat of
2124480	2128320	paint on it and let it out. And the fact that you can go on TV and say that without,
2129280	2133360	without feeling an enormous sense of shame is a very unhealthy sign.
2133360	2137840	Yeah. I mean, even on, I mean, I think I was watching something on TikTok just the other day.
2137840	2143280	It was a girl who must have been about 28. She was explaining how you could make a home into an HMO.
2143280	2153520	Yeah. Yeah. It's revolting. And when we had what was called the Rackman scandal in this country,
2154480	2160800	this scandal of violent thuggery in the private rented sector, there was a kind of moment of
2160800	2164880	national shame around the idea of landlordism. And one of the biggest landlords at the time
2164880	2169760	was the church, which sold off an awful lot of its stock because it didn't like the aesthetic of
2169760	2174160	being a landlord. So again, these are all things that we have done in the past. It's well within
2174160	2178000	our grasp to do it again. People should be ashamed to make TikToks and say, this is how you make an
2178000	2183120	HMO. Through shame. The church sold it off through shame. Well, it was embarrassing. It was, it was
2183120	2188960	also unprofitable. But for a variety of factors, the church, yet massively decreased its private,
2188960	2194720	private landlord practice. How realistic is that ambition going to be in, well, either of our,
2195760	2202240	well, near lifetimes? I think, I think it really is up to us. I think your right to point out that
2202240	2206960	the millennial experience is very different. And the generation below us is very different. And I
2206960	2214880	think there is a culmination of a sense of unfairness and rage. Because what the economic
2214880	2221520	purpose that our generation has served is to take all of our income and pass it on to already wealthy,
2222080	2229680	older people. And at a certain point, that the anger at that situation begins to dominate at a
2229680	2234080	certain point, the foolishness of that situation begins to dominate. And I don't think it's out
2234080	2240240	of the realm of possibility that, you know, as people who are in their 30s become, you know,
2240240	2245520	the ones who are running the Labour Party and important in government, the common sense,
2245520	2249200	there's a sudden outbreak of common sense. And everyone says, this is a stupid system.
2249200	2252720	It's plagued me my entire life. I will not have it plagued the next generation.
2252720	2257840	So you're hopeful for it? Yeah. And I think the renters unions are being so good at the moment.
2257840	2265040	I think housing campaigns are being so good at the moment, and capturing that nascent
2266160	2272240	resistance, that sense of this is wrong, and purposing it towards landlords. So I think
2272240	2276960	the energy is there, and the will is there, all we need to do is sort of consolidate it,
2276960	2281840	make sure it's pointed at the right people. And yeah, I would be very surprised if we come back
2281840	2286320	here in five years time, and we say, well, we've just kept the system of landlordism going. We've
2286320	2290320	done nothing to address it. I mean, even the Conservative Party is passing a renters reform
2290320	2295120	bill. Well, there's even quite a strong Conservative group as well. I think it's priced out. It's
2295120	2299520	called, isn't it? Yeah. They're not, they're not fans of me, and I'm not a fan of them.
2299520	2305360	Oh, no. Why? Is it the Marxism? It's the Marxism. It's the, I mean, what, what they do is they kind
2305360	2310240	of confect this debate about Yimbees and Yimbees. They say it's all to do with supply. And if you
2310240	2315680	are not a property development type, then you want to make the housing crisis worse. And it's
2315680	2319760	very effective with discourse. It's very effective at backing people into a corner and saying, well,
2319760	2324160	I'm a good guy. So I must be a Yimbe. And I just think this is a false argument to have.
2325280	2329760	They won over a lot of politicians. They won over a lot of influential people. But I think what I
2329760	2335120	would encourage your viewers to do is to question their logic, question their rhetoric, question
2335120	2340080	their data, and say, can you really convince me that there's a supply problem? Or do we solve the
2340080	2344560	housing crisis by the methods that were successful in the 20th century through regulation, through
2344640	2348720	rent controls, and through making landlords is a less profitable activity.
2349280	2354320	But I mean, is there any hope of anyone in the Conservative Party introducing more legislation,
2354320	2362320	more regulation? You know, it's historically true that Conservatives haven't like landlords,
2362320	2366800	as you pointed out, I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that Tories will say,
2366800	2372640	that's enough state spending on landlords now. Let's try and unwind it.
2372640	2379040	That's the sell. I can see that. Yeah, I think that and wage bills. But of course,
2380080	2384800	landlordism is so wrapped up with home ownership that at the moment, the bigger concern in their
2384800	2389120	mind is keeping home ownership going. And they seem to be willing to spend enormous amounts of
2389120	2393280	public money in the form of housing benefits to make sure that the home ownership system remains
2393280	2396400	in place. Thank you very much for coming in. It's been a real pleasure.
