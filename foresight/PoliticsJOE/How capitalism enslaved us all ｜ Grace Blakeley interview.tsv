0	2240	The neoliberal shift wasn't actually about shrinking the state.
2240	5720	What it was about was about crushing collective power.
5720	7440	The physical assertion of the power of the state,
7440	9200	that was the literal beating up of miners,
9200	12000	the use of the police to put them in their place.
12000	14080	But there was this ideological shift as well,
14080	18000	which was you are not a worker, you are not a citizen,
18000	19360	you are a consumer.
19360	22920	This toxic individualism that has become so pervasive
22920	27640	within our society has allowed our political class
27640	29080	to basically get away with murder.
29080	32760	We need to be presenting the idea of socialism,
32760	34960	not as a project of protection,
34960	36960	but as a project of collective empowerment.
36960	37920	Grace Blakely, hello.
37920	38920	Hi. How's it going?
38920	39920	Good thanks, how are you?
39920	41760	Very well. Very glad to have you here in the Polish Institute.
41760	42880	Lovely to be here.
42880	44560	Yes, great to have you here.
44560	47240	We're talking because of this weighty tone,
47240	49880	vulture capitalism, corporate crimes,
49880	52720	backdoor bailouts and the death of freedom,
52720	54880	a lot of substance which we're going to get into.
54880	56200	I'm glad you think so.
56200	56960	Did you enjoy it?
56960	57800	I did. Good.
57800	60880	But first, for those who don't know who you are,
60880	62680	how would you like to introduce yourself?
62680	63920	So I'm Grace Blakely.
63920	65680	I am a writer.
65680	67880	I write about political economy.
67880	69400	This is my latest book.
69400	73160	I've also got a very well and all good bookstores.
73160	76480	I'm also a staff writer for Tribune Magazine.
76480	80720	And I do bits and pieces in the media.
80720	81840	Nice. Okay.
81840	83440	In that subheading there, Death of Freedom,
83440	85160	I think that's the bit that stands out to me most
85160	86880	and is sort of recurrent throughout, right,
86880	91120	this loss of freedom or a lack of it under capitalism.
91120	93440	So can you start us off there?
93440	96360	Why is it that we're not free in our capitalist system?
96360	97880	I'm really glad that that kind of came through
97880	99040	as the central message of the book
99040	101560	because that is really where I wanted to start.
101560	105200	I think we are fed this line that we live
105200	107760	in this free market democratic system, right?
107760	109000	And that that's what capitalism is.
109000	112520	Capitalism means free markets and democracy.
112520	117520	And the kind of incursion of the state into the economy
118160	121240	limits freedom and creates this problem of big government.
121240	124720	And that results in this kind of dichotomized politics
124720	125560	that we have at the moment,
125560	126680	where it's basically just a debate
126680	129880	between some people saying, we need more market,
129880	131120	less government and other people saying,
131120	134240	we need like more government, less market.
134240	137920	And I just think that that kind of divide
137920	141640	is so just sterile and unhelpful.
141680	143080	And this really came through, I think,
143080	145040	during the COVID-19 pandemic.
145040	146320	So I started writing this book,
146320	149040	which just come out of the 2019 election defeat
149040	153720	and went straight into everything
153720	155560	that was going on around COVID.
155560	159720	And I started being asked like on mainstream TV questions
159720	162400	like, oh, well, the government's spending loads of money.
162400	163560	This is basically Corbanism.
163560	164480	This is what you wanted.
164480	166200	You've got what you campaigned for.
166200	168680	And I started to realize that people had,
168680	169920	there was just this amazing,
169920	171840	astonishing misunderstanding
171840	173200	as to what capitalism actually is
173200	174280	and what socialism is.
174280	178400	People thought that capitalism meant free markets
178400	179560	and the state not doing anything,
179560	182680	despite the fact that actually existing capitalism everywhere
182680	185160	has a very, very active role for the state.
185160	187000	That spending that was taking place during COVID,
187000	189240	it was basically the government funneling money
189240	191720	into massive corporations to landlords
191720	193520	into the financial system.
193520	196600	And somehow we're led to believe that that is socialism,
196600	199440	that the government propping up big business is socialism.
199440	202120	So I kind of wanted to cut through that divide
202120	205120	and say like, you know, this state versus market thing,
205120	206080	it doesn't really work.
206080	209280	It rests on this distinction between politics and economics.
209280	211440	It doesn't really stand up in practice.
211440	213760	You know, most of the time the state is acting
213760	215600	to defend the interests of big business
215600	217640	and big businesses working within the state
217640	221040	and alongside the state to do what it wants to do.
221040	224200	So how can we understand what like a kind of progressive
224200	227720	liberatory politics actually means in that context?
227720	232160	And for me, this always comes back to the dirty word, Marxism.
232160	235120	I think, you know, there's so much misunderstanding
235120	237080	as to what that means as well.
237080	240920	And I kind of start the book by looking at these two quotes.
240920	243280	One is from Marx, which is about him saying, you know,
243280	247600	the worker is treated as a kind of a bee under capitalism
247600	248760	where they just kind of follow orders
248760	251080	and kind of buzz around the hive.
251080	252640	Whereas actually they're architects.
252640	254440	They learn to kind of create,
254440	257120	they kind of yearn to create worlds in their head
257320	259360	and bring those into being with their hands.
259360	263000	And I contrast that with the kind of the quote from this free market,
263000	264960	the kind of darling of the neoliberals, Hayek,
264960	266440	who basically says, freedom of thought
266440	268640	is only of relevance to a small minority.
268640	271160	And it's him and actually even Keynes
271160	275000	and most of the big thinkers that we hold up in our political debate,
275000	276760	they basically all believe,
276760	278720	whether they're on the center left or the center right,
278720	280920	that the vast majority of people
280920	283600	should not be given the power to govern themselves
283600	285720	because they're too stupid or they're too impulsive
286120	288800	or they don't understand the stakes of the decisions that they're making.
288800	291760	Whereas for me, the fundamental insight of Marxism
291760	294480	is that the only way we get to liberation,
294480	297560	the only way we get to a fair and just society
297560	299400	is when people take power,
299400	302320	when they take power within their workplaces and their communities
302320	303840	over political life as a whole,
303840	306440	because politicians aren't going to listen to you if you don't demand it.
306440	308440	You know, corporations certainly aren't going to behave themselves
308440	310080	if you don't like force them to.
310080	313120	It's really up to us to actually begin to kind of build the society
313120	315120	that we want from the ground up.
316040	318480	A risk of asking an absurdly broad question,
318480	321760	but seeing as you just said it there about this kind of mischaracterization
321760	323880	of what Marxism means,
323880	325880	what does Marxism mean to you?
325880	327080	I know you spoke about it a little bit there,
327080	331720	but maybe could you try and put some truth to that sort of ism,
331720	335600	if you like, that style of thought, that method of political analysis?
335600	336520	Yeah, totally.
336520	340120	So as a kind of way of understanding capitalism,
340120	342800	it's, as you say, a kind of mode of analysis
342800	346960	that begins by looking at the way that we produce things as a society.
346960	351400	So rather than say, looking at the prevailing ideas within a society
351400	354640	and saying history is driven forward by these great battles
354640	359680	between different groups of ideologies or different sets of ideas,
359680	363240	Marxism says most of what happens within our society
363240	366720	is shaped by the conditions in which things are produced.
366720	370440	And the insight about capitalism is a social system
370480	373920	that rests upon the fact that some people own all the things
373920	375400	that we need to produce things,
375400	378000	and there's this big class of people who cannot survive
378000	380400	other than by selling their labour power for a living.
380400	383960	So just as an example, you know, there's a difference between capitalism,
383960	386480	this social system based on the production of commodities,
386480	388720	class-based system based on the production of commodities,
388720	391200	and feudalism, which is the system that revolves around land,
391200	393400	where you have an aristocracy that's in charge.
393400	395280	And again, this is about how things are produced,
395280	397360	like the political dynamics of feudalism come back
397360	399880	to the fact that a small class owns all the land
399880	403160	and the peasants have to work it to get what they need to subsist.
403160	407080	In the same way, the insight of Marxism is that it's this class-divided society
407080	409120	oriented around the production of commodities,
409120	411040	which is sold for profit,
411040	414000	and that that is undertaken through this class division,
414000	415480	this social division of labour,
415480	417760	where basically working people,
417760	419600	the people who are forced to sell their labour power,
419600	421680	are exploited by the ones who own things,
421680	424000	because they own the stuff that everyone else needs
424000	426040	just to be able to live.
426080	429480	And it's from that that you then begin to understand
429480	432120	the dynamics that I highlight in the book.
432120	434800	Because, you know, the other way of looking at capitalism
434800	436880	is, as I've said, that it's a system based on, you know,
436880	440040	private property and free markets, basically.
440040	443320	And then you have these ideas that only human freedom
443320	444880	can be protected by free markets,
444880	448080	and free markets are the only systems that lead to kind of democracy
448080	450240	and respect for human rights and all those different sorts of things.
450240	453280	That's the kind of lie that we're told about the way capitalism works.
453320	456360	But if you start from this perspective of seeing capitalism
456360	460240	as this system that's basically on class domination,
460240	462560	then things start to make a little bit more sense,
462560	465120	because we don't actually have free markets.
465120	466880	You know, there's lots of examples in this book
466880	471120	where I show that most of the major industries
471120	473600	within the world's economy are dominated by one or two firms
473600	478360	that are deeply corrupt and, like, in the pockets of politicians
478360	479440	and vice versa.
479440	481040	So I start with the example of Boeing, right,
481080	485160	which has been in the news recently for the doors blowing off its planes
485160	487200	at, you know, about 13,000 feet in the air.
487200	492920	This comes on the back of these crashes that took place several years ago now,
492920	495760	where over 350 people died in two separate crashes
495760	498640	where Boeing planes just nose-dived out of the air.
498640	500440	I won't give you all the gory details,
500440	505320	but suffice to say, people are Boeing knew about the flaws in this plane
505320	507880	before it was put on the market.
507920	510800	They deleted references to the system
510800	512600	that caused the problem in the pilot manual.
512600	515200	They didn't tell anyone what was going on.
515200	518720	These concerns weren't raised when the planes did crash.
518720	520440	They tried to blame the pilots.
520440	523960	The FAA, the regulator, basically did nothing.
523960	526360	And throughout all of this, the American state
526360	530000	was channeling billions of dollars' worth of tax cuts
530000	533560	and subsidies into Boeing.
533560	537160	And I think what that shows is that this argument that, you know,
537160	539040	let's say this problem with Boeing, right,
539040	540600	it shows that the market doesn't work
540600	542440	and we need to hand more power to the government.
542440	544760	Well, actually, the government was just as involved with this
544760	547640	as the executives at Boeing.
547640	549640	And it's because capitalism is this system
549640	551960	where everything is oriented around making sure
551960	555200	that the people who are in control of the production process
555200	557440	basically get what they want, right?
557440	560080	And so the only way to push back against that
560080	561920	isn't to say, let's give more power to politicians,
561920	564360	because, you know, half the time they're in the pockets of these guys,
564360	568360	is actually to say, how do we pull power down?
568360	569800	So how could workers within Boeing
569800	573680	have organized to resist both their exploitation
573680	575360	and the kind of corruption of this company?
575360	577080	And there's another example in the book
577080	580920	I look out of the Lucas Plan, where workers in an aerospace
580920	583000	company in the UK did just that.
583000	585760	They kind of organized to try and take control of the firm.
585760	589360	The audio recordings between the pilots union and Boeing
589360	591280	are extraordinary to listen to.
591280	593640	Yes.
593640	595920	OK, I was going to ask you about planned economies, which
595920	597360	are typically associated with communism.
597360	598800	But seeing as you mentioned feudalism,
598800	601120	I just want to at risk of taking this on a tangent already,
601120	602160	but why not?
602160	604200	We had Janice Verifakis in here a couple of months ago
604200	605800	talking about techno feudalism, right?
605800	609760	And this idea that actually we're past capitalism now,
609760	612720	and what our modern economic model actually far more closely
612720	615440	resembles feudalism than a lot of people would like to believe,
615440	618960	that these sort of cloud capital, these huge companies,
618960	620800	these huge corporations are actually, in a way,
620800	622280	modern feudal lords.
622280	623520	What do you make of that argument?
623520	625080	I don't know if you read the book and I appreciate it.
625080	626240	Yeah, I have.
626240	627000	I really like Janice.
627000	629240	I interviewed him for his book launch, actually,
629240	630760	a couple of months ago.
630760	632760	And I agree with a lot of his analysis,
632760	635720	but I think we come at it from different perspectives.
635720	637960	Because whilst a lot of the stuff that he writes about
637960	640080	in terms of the detail and the analysis as to what's
640080	643000	happening with the economy, I totally agree with.
643000	646520	I just think that that is part of capitalism.
646520	650960	And you see a lot of this stuff in progressive economics,
651000	654240	where you get critiques of the way that the economy works
654240	657240	from people who say, well, this isn't real capitalism.
657240	660320	They say, for example, the dominance of finance
660320	664080	means actually that you've got these monopolistic banks
664080	665680	sucking rents out of the economy,
665680	669320	as though they are the modern examples of feudal lords.
669320	672040	Or you've got too much concentrated corporate power.
672040	674840	That means we don't have free markets, so it's not capitalism.
674840	676280	And again, I come back to this point
676280	678800	that capitalism does not mean free markets.
678800	681680	Those two things are not the same.
681680	683160	Markets are an important part of the way
683160	684480	that capitalism functions.
684480	686800	They're a very important ideological part
686800	688040	of the way capitalism functions.
688040	690240	You have to believe that you're competing
690240	694080	against other people in this market for your labor.
694080	696000	Otherwise, the system loses legitimacy.
696000	698280	But the actual functioning of production
698280	700840	in the capitalist system centers far more
700840	703360	on stuff that happens within massive monopolistic
703360	706680	corporations than it does on the interactions that
706680	707920	take place in the market.
707920	709800	And this isn't a new thing.
709800	712280	In the book I go back to just like the example
712280	714960	of the East India Company, where
714960	716800	this was like this massive joint venture
716800	720480	between some wealthy and powerful people who
720480	723600	gained the right to create this big corporate entity
723600	727280	and the British state in pursuit of imperial power.
727280	730080	And that's another part of the book, which is that this nexus
730080	732720	of power that we see at the level of the domestic economy,
732720	735400	the kind of fusion of state and corporate power,
735400	738120	is often projected over the whole world economy
738120	740160	in the form of imperial power.
740160	742080	And yeah, this was a big part of the development
742080	744720	of British capitalism, the East India Company.
744720	747560	Adam Smith called it a strange absurdity.
747560	750360	He said it was a state in the disguise of a merchant.
750360	752760	And all the kind of original theorists of capitalism
752760	754280	were like, this doesn't really make sense.
754280	756880	This doesn't fit within the way that we think about capitalism.
756880	759320	But it was companies like the East India Company
759320	762480	and the AIC itself were central to the development
762480	765240	of the capitalist system across the world.
765240	767560	So there isn't this clean distinction
767560	775160	between corporate power and kind of free market capitalism.
775160	776480	Those two things go hand in hand.
776480	779480	The Anarchy by William Dalrymple is a really interesting study
779480	780480	on the East India Company.
780480	782000	He's great.
782000	783520	I've forgotten the name of it now,
783520	785160	but there's a method of system analysis,
785160	786640	which basically says if you want to understand
786640	789320	the intention of a system, you don't look at how it was designed.
789320	791280	You just look at the outcomes.
791280	793400	And so if you look at capitalism and you say,
793400	797320	well, modern capitalism is defined by financialization,
797320	799120	by the extraction of economic rent,
799120	800360	then it actually doesn't particularly matter
800360	801200	if that was never the intention.
801200	802200	If that's what it is now,
802200	805800	then actually that's one of the defining characteristics of it.
805800	807440	Yeah, no, completely.
807440	811320	And I think you can start by looking at the outcomes,
811320	813320	of course, and that is important.
813320	817120	And saying that capitalism kind of isn't working
817120	818960	in the way it's supposed to.
818960	820920	It kind of harkens back to people who are like,
820920	825360	oh, well, the like state socialism practice in the USSR
825360	827720	isn't real state socialism.
827720	830760	And yeah, I mean, I think that that was state socialism
830760	832400	and it's different to democratic socialism,
832400	833880	which is what I'm arguing for.
833880	835680	But it's kind of a bit of a,
835680	837520	it's kind of a non-argument, isn't it really?
837520	840160	It's like capitalism could be this nice, lovely,
840160	842000	fluffy, wonderful thing,
842000	843160	but it's just not working
843160	845840	because it's being kind of corrupted by people at the top.
845840	848560	And often this actually veers into like
848560	850200	anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, right?
850200	853760	Because people say, oh, capitalism is this lovely system,
853760	856240	but it's being corrupted by kind of evil financiers
856240	860080	or, you know, weird kind of lizard people or whatever.
860080	862600	I'm not up to date with all the latest conspiracy theories.
862600	864320	Not up to date, not up to date.
864320	866080	I think that one's still floating around.
866080	867840	There's some great YouTube videos
867840	869360	where like there's like a glitch or something
869360	871920	of like a royal and people like that was him shaped.
871920	875520	He's just taken from his lizard form into the human world.
875520	877120	I'm glad you mentioned the USSR, right?
877120	879080	Because you would typically associate planned economies
879120	881400	with those communist authoritarian states.
881400	882640	But you argue in the book, right,
882640	884440	that actually capitalist economies
884440	886520	are quite closely resembled right, a planned economy.
886520	888560	So who's doing the planning?
888560	889480	How does it work?
889480	890400	Talk us through it.
890400	891240	That is great.
891240	893360	That was nearly an exact quote from my book
893360	895200	when I say something like,
895200	897240	what's important isn't the presence or absence of planning.
897240	898360	It's who's doing the planning?
898360	900880	How is it being undertaken and in whose interests?
900880	903200	And I think that's really important because, yeah,
903200	904960	so, you know, just for clarity,
904960	906120	I'm not saying that there's no difference
906120	908760	between a state socialist and a capitalist economy.
908760	910920	Obviously there is.
910920	913840	But I suppose what I'm arguing is that there is this scale
915280	918800	along which you can chart most modern economies.
918800	921040	You can place most modern economies on the scale
921040	926040	between kind of pure anarchy and pure centralized control.
926840	928280	But actually the important thing to note
928280	931320	as well is that that scale has maybe at least two axes, right?
931320	935040	One of them concerns state planning and centralized control
935040	936880	and the other one concerns corporate planning
936880	938560	and centralized control.
938560	941560	So you could have, you know,
941560	944360	private corporate planning and state centralized control.
944360	945760	So like the USSR, obviously,
945760	948680	there was like an immense amount of centralized control
948680	950720	by the state over the economy.
950720	952160	Bear in mind that that centralized planning
952160	953840	was never total and it never can be.
953840	956320	You know, you never have a purely planned economy.
956320	958000	You never have a purely anarchic economy.
958000	959320	It's very important to remember
959320	961600	economies are always these kind of complex systems.
961600	963200	They never, and this is kind of again,
963200	964440	an insight from systems theory,
964440	966760	which Hayek, the famous neoliberal economist,
966760	967600	really liked.
967600	969960	The reason that he said that centralized planning
969960	973360	would always kind of create all these unintended consequences
973360	976160	because you can't ever completely control
976160	977680	a system as complex as an economy,
977680	979360	as complex as a society.
979360	982080	At the same time, those systems never collapse
982080	983080	into complete anarchy.
983080	984120	There's always some order.
984120	986400	There's always some stability that emerges
986400	987720	within those systems.
987720	990520	So economies operate in this, on the spectrum
990520	995520	between anarchy and centralized coordination and control.
996400	1000240	And you see this today if you look at, for example,
1000240	1002800	like Chinese state capitalism.
1002800	1005240	The Chinese economy is a capitalist economy.
1005240	1007680	It's oriented around the production of commodities
1007680	1011880	for sale and for profit.
1011880	1015800	And that is an incredibly centralized economy
1015800	1017880	where you have both the states
1017880	1020160	and extremely powerful corporations
1020160	1022000	that have an immense amount of control
1022000	1023880	over people's daily lives.
1023920	1028480	At the same time, the state in the US is also,
1028480	1030280	in some ways, fairly similar
1030280	1032840	because you have an immense amount of corporate control
1032840	1034920	over people's daily lives.
1034920	1037120	You have some of the largest and most powerful corporations
1037120	1039440	on the planet that are centered in the US.
1039440	1041160	They have, a lot of them have kind of
1041160	1043520	monopolistic control over their markets.
1043520	1045880	They have what's called kind of monopsony power
1045880	1047680	in the labor market, which means that they're able
1047680	1050120	to kind of control the market for labor.
1050120	1052040	They have immense lobbying power.
1052040	1055200	They kind of shape what happens within the state
1055200	1058840	at both the kind of federal level and a more local level.
1060000	1062440	They have kind of this immense ecological power
1062440	1066520	to shape the future of our relationship with the climate.
1067360	1069880	And they have the power to avoid and evade tax,
1069880	1072880	to promulgate laws, to break the law with impunity.
1072880	1075080	There's this massive issue of kind of corporate impunity
1075080	1077520	where you have basically corporations allowed
1077520	1080280	to break the law without any sanction whatsoever.
1081280	1084200	And all of this power is exercised, as I said,
1084200	1085680	with very little accountability
1085680	1090040	because these institutions have so much power within the state.
1090040	1093040	So, you know, we like to think of the divide, as I've said,
1093040	1095920	within our politics as one between kind of, you know,
1097120	1099640	centrally planned socialist economies on the one hand,
1099640	1100880	like we had in the USSR,
1100880	1103600	and then these lovely free market democratic
1103600	1105080	capitalist economies on the other hand,
1105080	1107360	and the US is supposed to be an exemplar of that.
1107360	1110680	But actually, if you take the kind of big superpowers
1110680	1112280	that we've seen in the world economy
1112280	1113720	over the last kind of hundred years,
1113720	1115920	the USSR, the US, and China,
1115920	1120160	all of them share in common this immense centralisation
1120160	1125080	of power at the centre among this core of, you know,
1125080	1128120	state apparatchiks, heads of major companies,
1128120	1130680	heads of major financial institutions.
1130680	1132640	And all of them share this problem.
1132640	1136560	Or, you know, if you're an elite, this positive element,
1136560	1138360	which is that the vast majority of people
1138360	1143360	have no real control over what happens in their daily lives.
1143360	1146080	They feel as though they have no power.
1146080	1148880	Now, of course, what I argue in the book is that we do have power.
1148880	1152200	If we are able to organise and resist the power
1152200	1156880	that has exerted upon society by these institutions,
1156880	1160480	then we can begin to change things.
1160480	1163120	But the world in which we live
1163120	1164520	is one in which we're told,
1164560	1168320	you, as an isolated individual, have no power up against this system
1168320	1170680	that is basically kind of all-encompassing.
1170680	1172560	Even as you're told, oh, you do have the power
1172560	1174640	to kind of decide what you want to consume
1174640	1176480	and decide who you want to vote for.
1176480	1179240	And, you know, you're in this, like, free market system
1179240	1183160	where you're completely free to make those micro-decisions
1183160	1184280	on a daily basis.
1184280	1187080	And yet the whole structure of the society in which you live
1187080	1189640	has already been decided by someone else.
1189640	1192200	And as a voter, as a consumer,
1192200	1193520	you have very little influence
1193520	1195520	over how those decisions are made.
1195520	1198720	I really want to drill into that feeling of powerlessness.
1198720	1201160	I think it's so relevant, you know, that...
1201160	1203200	call it capitalist realism,
1203200	1204680	call it a feeling of powerlessness, I don't know,
1204680	1207400	an omwi and apathy that essentially are an ability
1207400	1208920	to imagine an alternative.
1208920	1212200	Even though, as you write and as others have written as well,
1212200	1213400	there are alternatives.
1213400	1216400	There are, at risk of sounding like,
1216400	1219400	slightly sincere at earnest, like joyful alternatives, right,
1219400	1220880	where people can find self-expression,
1220880	1222800	self-realisation, self-actualisation.
1222840	1224560	But it's almost one of the defining characteristics
1224560	1229400	of the system, right, is its ability to drum out, reduce,
1229400	1232120	minimalise any idea or possibility of conceiving
1232120	1234800	of something alternative than what we currently have.
1234800	1239560	Yeah, and I think this problem actually comes down
1239560	1243280	to something that's shifted with the transition
1243280	1244800	towards neoliberalism.
1244800	1247560	So I argue in the book, right, the neoliberals,
1247560	1250000	the shift that we had in the 1980s with Thatcher, with Reagan,
1250000	1251880	this idea that we needed kind of privatisation,
1251880	1254560	free markets, a shrinking of the state,
1254560	1256560	none of those, like the shrinking of the state
1256560	1257960	didn't actually happen.
1257960	1260280	Those were all kind of ideological justifications
1260280	1263760	for what was actually just a massive reassertion
1263760	1268320	of the power of a big business, a finance, et cetera,
1268320	1271200	and a crushing of the power of working people,
1271200	1273280	particularly the labour movement.
1273280	1274800	But you had these narratives that were like,
1274800	1277080	we need privatisation, we need deregulation,
1277080	1279160	and that's going to deliver free markets,
1279160	1283680	and promote personal freedom and autonomy, basically.
1283680	1286280	In fact, what we've seen is, in many ways,
1286280	1288760	a kind of expansion of the power of the state,
1288760	1291200	and an expansion of corporate power alongside that.
1291200	1293600	Often we see kind of state power wielded
1293600	1294840	through the private sector as well.
1294840	1297920	I use some examples in the book, like G4S,
1297920	1302880	McKinsey, these kind of like quasi-public institutions
1302880	1306400	that are often charged with just astonishing corruption
1306400	1308720	or mismanagement or fraud or whatever.
1308800	1310160	And they just get away with it, sorry?
1310160	1311160	Macquarie's probably a pretty good example.
1311160	1313080	Yeah, exactly.
1313080	1315160	And they just get away with it because they're just so close
1315160	1318280	to these public institutions.
1318280	1320720	So the neoliberal shift wasn't actually
1320720	1321920	about shrinking the state.
1321920	1325920	What it was about was about crushing collective power.
1325920	1329520	And you see this with the first moves
1329520	1331920	that politicians like Bertrand Reagan undertake
1331920	1332760	when they come into power.
1332760	1335000	It was crush the labour movement.
1335000	1336960	And there was a discourse that surrounded this as well.
1336960	1339040	There was the physical assertion of the power of the state.
1339040	1340800	That was the literal beating up of miners,
1340800	1343560	the use of the police to put them in their place.
1343560	1345640	But there was this ideological shift as well,
1345640	1349600	which was you are not a worker, you are not a citizen,
1349600	1354600	you are a consumer, you are an entrepreneur of the self.
1355400	1358320	And a lot of neoliberal policies were designed to push this.
1358320	1361280	It was like, we will allow you to buy your own house.
1361280	1363520	We will privatise your pension.
1363520	1365520	You will be able to take out loads of debt.
1365520	1368040	Your life will become this balance sheet
1368040	1371400	of assets and liabilities and it's up to you to manage that.
1371400	1373960	If you manage it well, you will do well and you will succeed.
1373960	1375400	If you manage it badly, you will fail
1375400	1378160	and that will be entirely your own fault.
1378160	1381680	And even things like the privatisation of education.
1381680	1385000	Education becomes an investment in your human capital
1385000	1386880	and it's up to you to undertake that investment
1386880	1388520	and to make the best of it.
1388520	1393520	So you see this ideological decimation
1394200	1395760	of the collective consciousness
1395760	1399480	that was really the foundation of the post-war consensus.
1399480	1403800	And it's replacement with this rampant toxic individualism.
1403800	1405560	And I actually think that a lot of the problems
1405560	1407280	that we have in our society today,
1407280	1409840	whether it's like the crazy stuff that you see
1409840	1413960	on social media, whether it's this sense of powerlessness,
1414760	1417200	whether it's even like low pay as a result
1417200	1418680	of people not being able to organise,
1418680	1422680	they all come back to this question of individualism.
1422680	1425640	And you hear this, particularly among young people,
1425640	1428040	there's a sense that when things go wrong,
1428040	1429120	it's your own fault.
1429120	1430840	You have no one to blame but yourself.
1430840	1434240	And I think this is really like damaging people's mental health.
1434240	1437000	There's this sense of like deep and profound shame
1437000	1440360	at not being able to compete in the same way
1440360	1442320	as maybe those around you.
1442320	1444600	I think this feeds the rise of the far right.
1444600	1448440	I think young men who feel that they are unable
1448440	1452160	to kind of portray the kind of alpha characteristics
1452160	1454880	that are associated with like elite men,
1454880	1457000	get this sense of like resentment and anger
1457000	1459920	that they then kind of take out on the system as a whole.
1459920	1461520	And this again comes down to this idea
1461520	1463080	of like competitive individualism.
1463080	1464800	It is up to you to compete and do well.
1464800	1465640	And if you can't do that,
1465640	1467240	then you're a loser and a failure.
1467240	1469160	And all of this comes back to this shift
1469160	1470600	that was at the heart of neoliberalism,
1470600	1472640	which is that there's no such thing as society,
1472640	1473920	which is what Thatcher said,
1473920	1475880	it's all just a collection of isolated individuals
1475880	1477520	competing against each other.
1477520	1479920	And I mean, to illustrate what this means
1479960	1483440	for our sense of our own power within the system.
1483440	1486640	Think about like 50, 60 years ago,
1486640	1489880	if you as a worker were dissatisfied with your pay,
1489880	1492680	or you went home and you couldn't put food on the table,
1492680	1494600	you would have gone into your workplace,
1494600	1495680	chatted with your coworkers,
1495680	1496800	chatted with your union rep and said,
1496800	1498960	look, are you in the same position as me?
1498960	1500400	Cause I can't afford to feed my kids.
1500400	1501600	And they would have been like, yeah, you're right.
1501600	1503520	Okay, well, we need to do something about this.
1503520	1504800	We need to go and strike and organize
1504800	1506520	because our boss is exploiting us.
1506520	1508360	Today, if you can't put food on the table,
1508360	1509200	what do you do?
1509200	1510440	You blame yourself.
1510440	1512320	You maybe go out and get a personal loan,
1512320	1513760	a very high interest rate.
1513760	1515120	Some people become depressed
1515120	1516800	because they're like, I can't afford to feed my family.
1516800	1517640	I'm a loser.
1517640	1522640	There's no sense of your, you know, collective power
1523280	1527360	or indeed the way in which you are being exploited
1527360	1529120	because of your position within the system.
1529120	1531240	It's all, it's my fault, right?
1531240	1532880	Or sometimes it's their fault, right?
1532880	1534720	It's scroungers or immigrants or whatever.
1534720	1537160	It's like some problem over there.
1537160	1539920	And that I think is really what is preventing us
1539920	1542120	from being able to resist.
1542120	1545040	Because if people did have this greater sense
1545040	1548080	of like collective agency, then, you know,
1548080	1549600	we would have stronger unions.
1549600	1551240	People would be organizing in their workplaces
1551240	1552840	to demand higher wages.
1552840	1554800	We would have tenants unions, right?
1554800	1556120	People wouldn't be so easy to exploit
1556120	1558320	within the private rented sector.
1558320	1561240	And we do have those, but they would be stronger.
1561240	1564880	People would be pouring out onto the streets saying,
1564920	1567200	you know, we cannot afford to heat our homes.
1567200	1569320	This is a failure of our political class.
1569320	1572120	But instead, it's I'm a failure.
1572120	1574260	I have to use a food bank, right?
1574260	1576400	This like toxic individualism
1576400	1579040	that has become so pervasive within our society
1580200	1582560	has allowed our political class
1582560	1584320	to basically get away with murder.
1584320	1585960	Because instead of blaming them,
1585960	1587760	we all blame ourselves or we blame each other.
1587760	1589920	And that is I think the most profound ideological shift
1589920	1591280	that we've seen under neoliberalism.
1591280	1592400	I'm so glad you mentioned that
1592400	1593760	in the context of mental health.
1593800	1597000	Because I think one of the most damaging instances
1597000	1599920	of this sort of toxic individualism
1599920	1603520	and sort of high perseverance of the individual
1603520	1605240	is in sort of wellness, right?
1605240	1608840	It's like rather than engaging with a systemic analysis
1608840	1611880	of like, why do I feel anxious and depressed?
1611880	1613840	Maybe it's because I don't have secure housing.
1613840	1615200	Maybe it's because I'm low paid.
1615200	1617200	Maybe it's because I'm burdened with personal debt.
1617200	1620720	And instead it's work on yourself, set boundaries.
1621160	1625280	Do you actually maybe need to cut some people out of your life?
1625280	1627800	Like, what are you talking about?
1629240	1631800	Can you talk a little bit more about the role
1631800	1633760	that financial institutions played
1633760	1635880	in that sort of expansion of neoliberalism,
1635880	1639720	particularly in that sort of thatcherite 80s Britain?
1639720	1641240	Yeah, totally.
1641240	1643080	Yeah, I think that example of mental health
1643080	1644400	is really good, right?
1644400	1647200	And I want to say, you wouldn't see this
1647200	1648520	when it comes to people's physical health, right?
1648520	1650560	You wouldn't be like, oh, you know,
1650560	1653200	it's your fault that you've got lung cancer
1653200	1655200	because, I don't know, you're not looking after yourself.
1655200	1659080	You're not taking your daily turmeric or whatever.
1659080	1660560	But actually you do now see that, right?
1660560	1664720	It's like instances of illnesses that result
1664720	1667280	from social issues like air pollution
1667280	1668880	or not having adequate diet or whatever,
1668880	1671760	increasingly are being blamed on individual people.
1672920	1675200	So you're seeing this become more and more pervasive
1675200	1676880	in every area of society.
1676880	1680000	And there's obviously an ideological dimension here
1680000	1681520	as we've just discussed.
1681520	1685280	But again, coming back to this idea of what is Marxism,
1685280	1689880	we trace back things that happen in the realm of ideas
1689880	1692320	to things that happen in the realm of production,
1692320	1696040	in the economy or in politics or whatever.
1696040	1698080	We don't just say, oh, suddenly everyone changed their minds
1698080	1700280	or there was a really powerful ideological movement
1700280	1701600	that made everyone change their minds.
1701600	1703160	Those things are important
1703160	1705040	and these movements are spearheaded
1705040	1708200	by powerful groups of people who make these arguments
1708200	1709200	in the public sphere.
1709200	1710320	I wouldn't be out here talking to you
1710320	1712520	if I didn't think ideas were important.
1712520	1714600	But I do also think that a lot of the big shifts
1714600	1715920	that we see can be traced back
1715920	1720920	to what happens in politics and economics, basically.
1721160	1726160	And in the 80s, you did see this big shift towards
1726720	1731480	the creation of the kind of individual investor entrepreneur,
1731480	1734560	the mini capitalist, basically.
1734560	1739560	And that was a very self-conscious shift
1739560	1742120	that was functional both politically
1742120	1744840	and to the kind of economic transition
1744840	1746880	that we saw during the 80s.
1746880	1748360	So the reason it was functional politically
1748360	1750280	is what we've already heard, right?
1750280	1753720	If you replace a sense of collective agency
1753720	1756360	among people who are part of the working class
1756360	1757960	with this individualized sense of agency
1757960	1760640	that's like, I own my house, I have my own pension,
1760640	1763720	I care more about what the stock market is doing
1763720	1766160	than the average wage share of national income
1766160	1768000	because my pension's invested in that.
1768000	1770320	I care about what's going on in the housing market.
1770320	1773640	And I know that basically the more freedom we give the banks,
1773640	1774720	the better my pension will do
1774720	1777760	and the better my house will do.
1777760	1781400	So that political shift is great for the conservative party
1781400	1783200	and ultimately forces the Labour Party
1783200	1785480	to kind of adapt and shift its position
1785480	1788200	to accommodate neoliberalism as well.
1788200	1790640	And you get this neoliberal consensus
1790640	1792360	among all the major political parties.
1792360	1793520	But there is, as you mentioned,
1793520	1797120	this kind of economic underpinning to it as well.
1797120	1800120	And yeah, those shifts become functional
1800120	1803080	to basically the financialization of the economy as well.
1804200	1808240	I don't want to kind of get too into the nitty-gritty of this,
1808240	1811840	but things like pensions privatization, right?
1812720	1816320	It adds to this massive pool of capital
1816320	1819080	that can be played around with by the financial sector
1819080	1821040	by these huge asset managers
1821040	1823920	that we now have, institutions like BlackRock, for example,
1823920	1826040	which I write about in the book.
1826040	1827560	It's this institution that controls
1827560	1829280	other people's money, basically,
1829280	1832360	and is invested in most companies,
1832360	1833640	most large companies in the world,
1833640	1835840	just because it has indices that track
1835840	1837600	what goes on in the stock market.
1837600	1841480	And you have basically, as a result of that investment power,
1841480	1843720	the head of BlackRock is able to write
1843720	1846360	to the corporations that BlackRock has invested in,
1846360	1848280	which is basically every large corporation on earth
1848280	1850120	and say, we think you should do this,
1850120	1852000	we think you should do that, right?
1852000	1854640	That is not the way that a free market is supposed to function.
1854640	1857000	A free market is supposed to be lots of little individual people
1857000	1858160	putting their money into a pot,
1858160	1860200	and then the money goes to the most profitable firms
1860200	1861760	because that's how the market works.
1861760	1864760	It's not like these huge behemoths
1864760	1867840	that are basically able to direct and plan
1867840	1869400	what happens within markets.
1869400	1873080	That's kind of contrary to how we're told
1873080	1874960	capitalism is supposed to work.
1874960	1876760	So that kind of shift towards financialization
1876760	1879040	was really facilitated by, yeah,
1879040	1880560	things like pension privatization.
1880560	1885280	And obviously, the long boom of the 1990s,
1885280	1886400	which had, I mean, it's just,
1886400	1891400	it's difficult to begin to kind of categorize the shift
1892120	1894560	that that moved towards the kind of
1894560	1897280	home-owning democracy had on our politics
1897280	1898400	and our economics, right?
1898400	1900520	If you think about that, like the long 1990s
1900520	1903880	from the end of the first housing market crash
1903880	1905720	and kind of like the early 1990s,
1905720	1908400	when house prices just skyrocketed
1908400	1911160	because you had the complete unleashing
1911160	1914680	of the power of finance, everyone could get a mortgage.
1914680	1916800	It seemed like there was just this endless pool of money
1916800	1919200	that was circulating around the world economy.
1919200	1921640	People did buy their houses often on the cheap,
1921640	1922840	through right to buy.
1922840	1927000	You suddenly created this class of asset owners
1927000	1930160	who were much more identified with house prices
1930160	1932080	and the performance of the stock market
1932080	1933960	than they were anything else.
1933960	1936440	You had just this, you know,
1936480	1938480	astonishing wave of globalization as well
1938480	1940160	that happened throughout the global economy.
1940160	1944000	And there was this like incredible optimism
1944000	1946440	that was among the kind of the capitalist class
1946440	1948120	at this point that Gordon Brown said,
1948120	1949880	we've ended boom and bust.
1949880	1951400	There were all these economists saying,
1951400	1953600	we're gonna liberate the poor world.
1953600	1957160	You know, the former communist countries
1957160	1960160	are gonna become, you know, these free market utopias.
1961400	1963640	But like up to 2007,
1963640	1966960	just the kind of millenarian like optimism
1966960	1969120	of those who were supporting this
1969120	1971480	like neoliberal financialized shift was,
1971480	1973040	it was hard to argue against, right?
1973040	1974000	Even for those on the left,
1974000	1975880	there was the sense that, yeah, you know, fine,
1975880	1977440	capitalism's kind of won.
1977440	1980000	Like what can we really do other than like-
1980000	1980840	And history.
1980840	1981960	Exactly, yeah.
1981960	1983400	And then you get the financial crisis
1983400	1987520	and you realize that all of that was just based on
1987520	1990040	not only a kind of lie, a political lie,
1990040	1992840	but also just deeply unsustainable economics.
1993760	1998760	And a politics which has really just like torn apart
2000240	2001800	the fabric of our society.
2001800	2004120	And we're living with the result of that now.
2004120	2007200	We're living with the result of the kind of the arrogance
2007200	2011760	of the ideologues of capital during their heyday.
2011760	2016640	And yet, because they were so successful
2016640	2019720	in like shattering our sense of collective agency
2019720	2022280	and our ability to imagine a different world,
2022280	2023960	we haven't moved beyond that.
2023960	2026480	And it's just kind of like people fiddling around the edges
2026480	2029160	being like, how do we get back to before the financial crisis
2029160	2031200	without the acknowledgement that there is no going back?
2031200	2032520	So to get beyond that then,
2032520	2035240	and I'm struck again by our use of the word sort of power,
2035240	2037000	right, in relation to this sort of untrammeled
2037000	2041200	financialization and in the face of that,
2041200	2042840	you know, these ginormous corporations,
2042840	2045160	these ginormous financial institutions,
2045160	2049120	we have individualized sort of atomized, fractured people
2049120	2050120	in our society.
2051080	2054840	So how effective is something like trade union organization?
2054840	2056920	How effective is something like an expanding
2056920	2059960	sort of collective consciousness in combating
2059960	2061880	and dealing with those forces?
2061880	2065400	Because, I don't know, I look at Port Talbot, right?
2065400	2068080	Thousands of job losses for the steel workers there.
2068080	2070840	And it connects to what we're talking about, right?
2070840	2072320	Because it's not just a job loss.
2072320	2074920	It is literally like the community,
2074920	2078880	the sense of sort of collective pride place,
2079600	2080960	yeah, sense of home almost,
2080960	2083960	and that collapsing has deep, deep ramifications.
2085040	2088240	So in a sentence, sort of how effective is trade union
2088240	2090240	organization or similar mechanisms
2090240	2093560	in confronting these incredibly powerful institutions?
2093560	2095720	I think the problem that we have with organizing today
2095720	2100080	is that even collective institutions have been,
2101880	2105280	you know, paralyzed by this sense of individualism.
2105280	2108280	They've kind of been infected by individualism.
2108280	2111960	So if you go back to, I write in, again, in the book
2111960	2113520	about the example of the Lukas plan.
2113520	2116640	So, you know, contrast what happened at Boeing,
2116640	2118360	or, you know, indeed what happened at Port Talbot
2118360	2119640	with the example of the workers
2119640	2121800	at Lukas Aerospace in the 1970s.
2121800	2125080	Their plan, well, their company was kind of under threat
2125080	2126960	from rising competition from abroad.
2126960	2128920	They appealed to the then labor government
2128920	2131320	saying, we want you to nationalize us.
2131320	2133520	And Tony Bend and their minister for trade and industry
2133520	2136240	replied and said, we can't do that right now.
2136240	2137720	You guys need to come up with a plan
2137720	2139440	as to how you can save this firm yourself.
2139440	2141120	And Ben was, again, one of these big believers
2141120	2142840	in democratic socialism.
2142840	2146240	And so the workers were like, right, okay, what do we do?
2146240	2149560	And the union representatives basically surveyed
2149560	2151480	all of the workers at Lukas Aerospace
2151480	2153560	and said, what do you think we should do?
2153560	2155680	How could we transform the operation
2155680	2159520	of this largely weapons manufacturer, basically?
2159520	2161120	And the workers came back and they said,
2161120	2162680	we need to transform this institution
2162680	2166440	into a worker owned, democratically run organization
2166440	2169280	that produces socially useful commodities,
2169280	2171600	not weapons, basically.
2171600	2173840	And they put together this document called the Lukas Plan,
2173840	2176600	which was just probably one of the most radical documents
2176600	2178080	in Britain's economic history.
2179120	2182320	It comprised ideas that had been put forward
2182320	2185520	by workers from throughout Lukas Aerospace
2185520	2187760	to use the tools and the skills
2187760	2188800	that were then available to them
2188800	2190400	to transition from the production of weapons
2190400	2194080	to things like kidney dialysis machines, wind turbines,
2194080	2196040	things that would be useful for society.
2196040	2198800	And at the same time, these workers had said,
2198800	2200400	this is how we'll manage ourselves.
2200400	2202920	This will be the ownership structure of the organization.
2202920	2204640	This is the way that we'll transition
2204640	2205960	to this new way of working.
2205960	2210760	It was this incredible business plan, basically,
2210760	2215760	that totally undermined the spirit of capitalism,
2216160	2218200	which is that the owners own the firm,
2218200	2220080	the managers manage the firm on their behalf
2220080	2221480	and the workers do as they're told.
2221480	2222720	And this is all based on the idea
2222720	2224480	that entrepreneurs and workers and managers
2224480	2226080	are these really clever people
2226080	2228120	who just know how an organization should work
2228120	2229960	and are really good at telling people what to do.
2229960	2231400	And workers at Lukas Aerospace were like,
2231400	2233800	no, we know exactly how this firm should be run.
2233800	2235000	We know what we should be doing.
2235000	2237240	We're perfectly capable of managing ourselves.
2237240	2240360	And that's why it was so much more threatening
2240360	2241720	to the established order
2241720	2243640	than even the idea of nationalization.
2243640	2244480	There's loads of companies
2244480	2245600	that were nationalized at the time.
2245600	2247360	This was something else entirely.
2247360	2249320	It threatened this idea
2249320	2252480	that people need to be managed and controlled.
2252480	2256600	And I think that is actually the most threatening thing
2256600	2259480	that the most threatening thing that we can believe
2259480	2260680	in a capitalist economy.
2260680	2262680	It's that we don't need to be managed and controlled,
2262680	2266720	that we have the power to govern ourselves, basically.
2266720	2269480	And there are a load of really amazing examples
2269480	2271320	of people doing exactly that in the book.
2271320	2272800	One of the ones that's closest to my heart,
2272800	2274280	you know, we mentioned Port Talbot,
2274280	2275760	there's this little town in North Wales
2275760	2277520	called Blyneifestiniog,
2277520	2279720	which is one of these kind of left behind areas.
2279720	2282240	It's a former slate mining community.
2282240	2286160	And instead of kind of, you know,
2286160	2288560	allowing themselves to be consigned to this idea
2288560	2289960	of like a left behind neighborhood,
2289960	2291920	the people in this town got together.
2291920	2293440	A few people started and they basically said,
2293440	2296200	we're going to start a community enterprise
2296200	2297840	to create jobs in the local area
2297840	2299720	and give people a fighting chance.
2299720	2302320	And as soon as people saw a couple of people do this,
2302320	2305160	they were like, why can't we set up a community enterprise?
2305160	2307520	Why can't we set up a community owned energy company
2307520	2309200	that will provide us with cheap energy
2309200	2312040	instead of, you know, paying tons of money
2312040	2314040	to these, you know, privatized utility companies
2314040	2317680	when there's hydroelectric power that's being, you know,
2317680	2320480	monopolized by this corporation
2320480	2322240	that's extracting all the wealth from this community.
2322240	2325400	We could actually just generate our own power ourselves.
2325400	2327520	And suddenly you had all of these community enterprises
2327520	2331000	springing up, just this incredible ethos of self-help.
2331000	2332560	There was some support through something called
2332560	2334880	the community's first program by the Welsh government.
2334880	2338080	But largely speaking, this was people just being like,
2338080	2340960	we don't have to accept things being this way.
2340960	2343240	We see a similar sort of thing in Preston, for example,
2343240	2344960	where you have the community wealth building agenda,
2344960	2347920	the council is supporting the creation of cooperatives,
2347920	2350800	democratic, local banking, all these different things.
2350800	2352280	The participatory budgeting movement
2352280	2354920	that's spread around the world where, you know,
2354920	2356240	residents are given the power
2356240	2358480	to determine how their municipal budget is spent.
2358480	2361040	The evidence is just so, so clear
2361040	2364800	that when people start to believe that they have the power
2364800	2366280	to be able to govern themselves,
2366280	2369200	to be able to make decisions about their communities,
2369200	2370640	about their workplaces,
2370640	2374400	they take that power and they wield it in service
2374400	2376960	of the collective, of their community,
2376960	2378600	of, you know, the people around them.
2378600	2381520	They basically use it to build socialism.
2381520	2384480	And the biggest thing standing in the way
2384480	2386680	of our getting from here to there
2386680	2390040	is just this pervasive and widespread belief
2390040	2392840	that I am on my own, there's nothing I can do.
2392840	2395520	The powers that are united against me are too strong
2395520	2398240	and, you know, no one else wants to work
2398240	2400280	with me to change things.
2400280	2401440	Which is actually why I believe, you know,
2401440	2404040	I'm not saying that all these small individual examples
2404040	2407720	of the resistance to capitalism or neoliberalism
2407720	2409920	are going to be enough to shift the nature
2409920	2410960	of the whole system.
2410960	2413160	What I am saying is the biggest thing
2413160	2416280	standing between us and progressive change
2416280	2418640	is basically individualism.
2418640	2421800	And these examples of people working together
2421800	2426400	to resist their exploitation, to build better communities,
2426400	2429600	they just shatter individualism.
2429600	2432320	You go to these communities and people do not share
2432320	2434920	this like individualistic, competitive mindset.
2434920	2437560	They have, you know, their own personal dreams
2437560	2439600	and aspirations and wants and a secure sense
2439600	2442880	of their own self, but they also view their identity
2442880	2446000	as tied to what happens to the people around them.
2446000	2448920	I'm really struck by these examples
2448920	2451920	of what a better future possibly looks like
2451920	2453400	within the context of what you said earlier
2453400	2454600	about our political paradigm,
2454600	2457840	that there is essentially basically a binary, right,
2457840	2460720	about the size of the state and the size of welfare.
2460720	2464480	So how do you see that better future sitting within
2465760	2467440	something that kind of, I guess you could call
2467440	2470320	technocratic governance, the sort of the managerialism
2470320	2473320	of Prime Minister Sunak or likely a Prime Minister Stammer?
2473320	2477800	Yeah, I mean, it just means democratizing everything.
2477800	2482800	Like just demanding more power being handed down to
2482800	2485480	whether that's, you know, local communities,
2485480	2487800	whether it's, you know, devolution and decentralization
2487800	2490720	whether it's demanding workers are able to take power
2490720	2493560	within their organizations, you know,
2493560	2497680	the removal of the massive restrictions
2497680	2499120	that have been placed on our rights
2499120	2502720	to do things like protest and assemble and speak out
2502720	2506320	against, you know, the horrors that are being committed
2506320	2508920	by our government here and all over the world.
2508920	2511200	It really requires like a reinvigoration
2511200	2513480	at the political level when we're thinking about politics,
2513480	2517840	a reinvigoration of the idea of democracy, basically.
2517840	2520720	Now we live in a country where the kind of liberal
2520720	2523400	democratic revolution of the kind that, you know,
2523400	2526000	we saw during the 1800s, that hasn't even been completed.
2526000	2526880	We've still got a monarchy.
2526880	2529200	We've still got an unelected chamber in the House of Lords.
2529200	2532240	We still have a private corporation that runs,
2532240	2534200	you know, the heart of our financial sector,
2534200	2535280	the City of London Corporation,
2535280	2538960	which is a private corporation in the guise
2538960	2540700	of a public local authority.
2540740	2544300	So we have all these hangovers from the feudal era,
2544300	2547020	the undermined democratic processes.
2547020	2549980	And on top of that, we have these neoliberal shifts
2549980	2553140	that have aimed to insulate even more areas of the state
2553140	2555780	from democratic accountability.
2555780	2557820	So, you know, we have like the Bank of England
2557820	2560420	being made independent, i.e.,
2560420	2562100	not subject to democratic scrutiny,
2562100	2564300	which means that its decisions are much more likely
2564300	2567660	to be influenced by the, you know, financial sector
2567660	2569180	that has the air of bank officials
2569180	2572380	than they are the preferences of ordinary people.
2572380	2576540	You have just the outsourcing of huge swathes
2576540	2579340	of public services to private corporations
2579340	2581980	that, you know, you cannot really control.
2581980	2583100	You cannot really hold accountable.
2583100	2584860	They're supposed to be held accountable by the government,
2584860	2587700	but the people who write the contracts
2587700	2590060	according to which these services are procured
2590060	2592540	also consult for the firms that are bidding
2592540	2593380	for those contracts.
2593380	2596300	It's this kind of revolving door of corporate power
2596300	2599580	that connects like public sector institutions
2599580	2602460	with private sector outsourcing organizations.
2602460	2604460	There's no real democratic accountability there.
2604460	2606500	You've seen a massive centralization of power.
2606500	2608340	You know, when Thatcher came to power,
2608340	2610980	she smashed the GLC.
2610980	2614220	The guy who was instrumental in putting together
2614220	2617500	the Lucas Plan after he was fired from Lucas
2617500	2620140	for union organizing went to work for the GLC,
2620140	2622460	the Greater London Corporation,
2622460	2625140	which was then kind of sponsoring
2626140	2627780	these ideas around how you could make
2627780	2629220	democratic planning a reality,
2629220	2630620	how you could start to bring the ideas
2630620	2633860	that we saw at Lucas Aerospace to the public sector.
2633860	2637380	Thatcher crushed the GLC precisely because
2637380	2639940	it was doing some of that interesting experimentation.
2639940	2641700	We're seeing, again, this kind of revival
2641700	2643980	of that type of movement around democratic planning
2643980	2645340	in places like Preston.
2645340	2648020	And that's why places like Preston
2648020	2650060	is seen as so threatening to the State of Squire.
2650060	2652460	It's why we haven't seen what should be like...
2653420	2655260	I spoke to a conservative the other day
2655260	2657300	who said that community wealth building
2657300	2658940	should be a conservative policy.
2658940	2660780	It should be handing power back to communities,
2660780	2664540	but they can't accept the idea that that would happen
2664540	2667260	because it runs contrary to this spirit of hierarchy
2667260	2669420	that is really what underpins capitalism.
2670860	2675740	So, yeah, that shift towards community power
2675740	2679620	and towards worker power and people power
2679620	2682740	is so deeply threatening to the status quo.
2682740	2687740	And it really requires us to just like,
2688780	2692540	yes, kind of combat this mindset of individualism
2692540	2694340	and also just like resist.
2694340	2697580	It becomes so hard to think about
2699740	2702740	constructive ways of resisting in the system that we have.
2702740	2704620	All we can do is we kind of go online
2704620	2706540	and we may be like fire off an angry tweet
2706540	2709100	every now and again because we look at the system
2709100	2710540	and it seems so broken.
2710540	2713060	But actually, if you're able to kind of get offline
2713060	2716820	and get into spaces where people are organizing with tenants
2716820	2718860	to like prevent rogue landlords,
2718860	2721580	organizing with migrants to support them
2722580	2724180	to fight for their rights,
2724180	2725980	just protesting on the street, getting out
2725980	2730980	and making your voice heard to the political class.
2731340	2733660	All of these forms of resistance are,
2735580	2737980	yes, they're reactive, but they're also constructive
2737980	2739300	because you start to build these bonds
2739300	2742620	and these subjectivities that allow us to think beyond
2742620	2746500	this like toxic individualism and hierarchy
2746500	2750060	that makes up our current system.
2750060	2752460	That's really interesting because my inclination is
2752460	2755980	to compare us with the two main possible
2755980	2758100	political vehicles for government in this country
2758100	2760020	as technocratic organizations,
2760020	2762580	particularly under Labour and the Kids at the moment.
2762580	2764340	We're just hearing you then talking about street politics,
2764340	2766020	participatory street politics.
2766020	2767900	And I'm admittedly, I'm thinking about this now.
2767900	2769660	So I don't know if you'll stand up to particularly much
2769660	2771780	scrutiny, but in light of the shenanigans
2771780	2773060	that are going on in Parliament right now,
2773060	2774700	I mean, there may well be a different speaker
2774700	2775900	of House of Commons by the time this is,
2775900	2778900	so let's park that for the time being.
2778900	2782140	But the Labour Party's position on Gaza,
2782140	2782980	and I'm not trying to talk about Gaza,
2782980	2784380	I want to talk about street politics here,
2784380	2787860	it's changed, it's moved, it's gone from the permission
2787860	2791340	of Israel to impose collective punishment on Gaza
2791340	2793620	to calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
2793620	2796700	And I think you, I want to think,
2797060	2799500	I want to think that the fact that hundreds of thousands
2799500	2801460	of people have turned out on the streets of London
2801460	2803220	weekend after weekend,
2803220	2805220	has made some kind of difference to that.
2805220	2806300	Maybe I'm being naive.
2806300	2808220	I think it's more to do with the fact
2808220	2812820	that the American state's position is slightly marginally
2812820	2815180	shifting as a result of the utter chaos
2815180	2817180	that's going to be unleashed as a result of this conflict
2817180	2820420	and that Britain basically follows tail between its legs,
2820420	2821380	everything that happened.
2821380	2823300	We have effectively no independent foreign policy,
2823300	2826540	we just kind of follow mindlessly what's going on
2826540	2828820	in the US, but having said that,
2828820	2830660	part of the reason that the situation is becoming
2830660	2833060	so untenable over there and over here
2833060	2836460	is because people are refusing, as you say,
2836460	2839500	to just accept the mainstream narrative
2839500	2840660	as to what's going on.
2840660	2841860	I know so many people,
2841860	2844660	and I think this is a widespread feeling
2844660	2846020	when it comes to particularly what's going on
2846020	2847740	at the moment in Gaza.
2847740	2851380	You go online and you see just the raw footage
2851380	2856380	that's being posted of people's limbs being blown off
2856620	2859540	by weapons that are being sold to the Israeli state
2859540	2860940	by our government.
2860940	2863220	And then you look at the news
2863220	2867620	and it's just the same propaganda
2867620	2869100	that's being repeated over and over again,
2869100	2873460	barely any mention of the actual state of affairs
2873460	2875220	on the ground in Palestine.
2875220	2877900	Very rarely do you see a Palestinian voice
2877900	2882020	out there kind of advocating for their people.
2883020	2885180	Even when we had the ruling in the ICJ,
2885180	2888220	that was barely covered on the day
2888220	2892740	that we heard evidence against Israel.
2893900	2897020	And I think that creates this sense of unreality.
2897020	2898180	I've heard so many people say,
2898180	2900460	it feels like I'm going insane
2900460	2902540	because you see what is happening
2902540	2904620	and then you go to institutions
2904620	2907460	that you kind of think that you should broadly trust
2907460	2908820	to tell you the truth
2908820	2913540	and you see things are one-sided or ignored
2913620	2917140	or just like kind of skewed.
2917140	2918460	And then you start to think,
2918460	2920260	well, where else is this happening?
2920260	2921900	And it's not obviously just happening
2921900	2923380	in Gaza at the moment.
2923380	2927100	Like last year and for a long time now,
2927100	2928460	we've been seeing basically a genocide
2928460	2930660	that's been happening in Ethiopia and Tigray.
2930660	2931580	No reporting on that
2931580	2935300	because it doesn't meet the foreign policy objectives
2935300	2937100	of the British state for people to know about that.
2937100	2938740	Same thing is happening in Sudan
2938740	2940020	or in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
2940020	2942020	There are all these conflicts
2942020	2943500	that we just don't hear about
2943500	2946940	and instead we hear constantly endless coverage
2946940	2948500	about what's going on in Ukraine
2948500	2950980	because it meets the foreign policy objectives
2950980	2953540	of the British state for people to know
2953540	2956380	that Russia is doing objectively horrible things.
2956380	2958060	But there are lots of other governments around the world
2958060	2959580	that are doing objectively horrible things,
2959580	2960700	including our own.
2960700	2963500	Many governments being funded by the British government,
2963500	2965300	being provided arms by the British government
2965300	2966740	that are also doing horrible things.
2966740	2968300	And yet we hear nothing about that
2968300	2970020	because it doesn't meet the foreign policy objectives
2970020	2971020	of the British state.
2971020	2975620	And I think this really comes down to a question of like,
2975620	2978100	I don't think that the presenters on the BBC
2978100	2981740	are like deliberately skewing the output
2981740	2982940	that they put out there.
2982940	2986220	What I do think is that how is the news agenda formed?
2986220	2987460	Like how is the news reported?
2987460	2989940	It's reported based on what happens in the papers, right?
2989940	2991220	There's always a paper review.
2991220	2992460	What determines what goes in the papers?
2992460	2994300	Well, these are literally owned by like oligarchs
2994300	2995700	and like massive corporations
2995700	2998420	that just exist to promote their own interests.
2998420	3002500	Or it is determined by what politicians say.
3002500	3004460	So politicians in many ways kind of shape the news agenda.
3004460	3006660	I remember talking to a presenter not that long ago
3006660	3008580	who was like, well, if you want this item
3008580	3009420	to be on the news agenda,
3009420	3011940	then you need to get Kya Starma to say something about it
3011940	3013300	because otherwise we can't report on it.
3013300	3015860	It's not news, like that wouldn't be kind of objective.
3015860	3018500	So when you have this, you know,
3018500	3020700	narrowing of the political agenda
3020700	3023580	among the two biggest political parties,
3023580	3026420	the news follows and it creates this air of unreality
3026420	3027260	because you're like,
3027260	3030380	why aren't we hearing about some of the biggest,
3030380	3031220	like most important issues?
3031220	3033100	If you want to move away from, you know,
3033100	3034060	questions around conflict,
3034060	3036500	why aren't we hearing about the fact much more frequently
3036500	3038020	that like last year was, you know,
3038020	3039740	potentially the warmest year on record,
3039740	3043380	maybe we're starting to see breaching the Paris agreements
3043380	3046340	about 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.
3046340	3047940	Like these massive matter of issues
3047940	3051020	that literally determine whether or not people live or die,
3051020	3052780	that determine the future of humanity,
3052780	3054340	we don't see them being covered
3055300	3058860	because of this just like insulation
3058860	3060940	like of our political class
3060940	3062980	from democratic accountability.
3062980	3066500	And the way that we have seen that begin to shift
3066500	3068620	is when people get out onto the streets.
3068620	3070820	You know, when you do have a protest that is big enough,
3070820	3072420	we saw this, I remember actually,
3072420	3074980	I think it was during the 2019 election campaign,
3074980	3076980	suddenly climate became an issue.
3076980	3079020	Like it almost kind of, it didn't come out of nowhere,
3079020	3080260	but it felt like it came out of nowhere
3080260	3082220	because these people were pouring onto the streets
3082220	3085740	and saying, we demand action on this, right?
3085740	3088700	And, you know, I think it is interesting seeing
3088700	3092500	how public opinion and the news agenda can begin to shift
3092500	3095020	when you do actually get people organizing
3095020	3098780	to demand a different way of doing politics.
3098780	3100060	It's really interesting to hear you say that
3100060	3104260	because the sort of the way the British political media
3104260	3105820	has covered the environment recently
3105820	3107780	is basically in the context of whether or not
3107780	3110220	labor is gonna spend 28 billion pounds of capitalization
3110220	3111060	on it rather.
3111060	3114100	And it becomes kind of a Westminster political story
3114100	3116660	about to what extent labor is going to borrow to invest,
3116660	3117820	which can be a high-minded one
3117820	3120060	if it's had in the right way, I don't think it is,
3120060	3123820	rather than is the price of the future ecological viability
3123820	3125260	of the planet 28 billion pounds.
3125260	3126100	Yeah.
3126100	3128420	And the people who use job is that it will say,
3128420	3130140	well, it's not my job to report on that.
3130140	3131900	That's up to climate scientists or whatever.
3131900	3135180	And it's like, well, what is the point in the news
3135180	3138180	if it's literally just telling us like the shenanigans
3138220	3142020	and the gossip of these just like closed-minded,
3142020	3144620	half of them are corrupt politicians
3144620	3147180	that are like swanning around Westminster being like,
3147180	3149580	well, you know, I am completely in control
3149580	3150740	of this democracy and everyone else
3150740	3152020	will do what I tell them to do.
3152020	3156060	Like, it's just, this is why it's actually so good
3156060	3159380	to have such a growing and vibrant alternative media
3159380	3161780	in this country because I do think, you know,
3161780	3163860	that juxtaposition I was talking about
3163860	3165380	between what you see online and what you see in the news
3165380	3167860	is pushing people away from those mainstream sources
3167860	3170940	and actually encouraging people to get their analysis
3170940	3173220	and the depth of the analysis that they want.
3173220	3175460	Places like here, for example.
3175460	3177260	And the Vara attribute where I work.
3177260	3179420	Absolutely, yeah, very much so.
3179420	3180900	Last question for you and I'll try and leave it
3180900	3183220	on a slightly more optimistic note.
3183220	3184060	Yeah.
3184060	3185820	You write in the book,
3185820	3188100	since that political debate has failed to break out
3188100	3189780	of a sterile dichotomy, those on the left argue
3189780	3191780	for higher public spending funded by taxes on the rich,
3191780	3193780	those on the right argue for cuts to public spending in tax.
3193780	3195980	When we accede to the idea that politics is a battle
3195980	3197020	between the state and the market,
3197020	3199900	we play into the hands of the right.
3199900	3202860	So what should the left be presenting as an argument
3202860	3207660	or as a belief system to try and transcend that dichotomy?
3207660	3212540	I think after that, talk about how we need
3212540	3215700	to be presenting the idea of socialism,
3215700	3217900	not as a project of protection,
3217900	3220340	but as a project of collective empowerment.
3220340	3223180	So it's not about going to people and saying,
3223180	3225740	you know, businesses have been mean,
3225780	3228660	so hand more power to me, a politician,
3228660	3230180	and I'm going to save you.
3230180	3232140	Or indeed, politicians have been mean,
3232140	3234020	hand more power to me, another politician,
3234020	3235860	and I'll do things differently, right?
3235860	3240220	It's about demanding that the people who are in charge
3240220	3242500	actually respect the people that they're supposed
3242500	3245700	to govern enough to give them the power
3245700	3248260	to shape the conditions of their lives.
3248260	3250060	And what does that mean in practice?
3250060	3254220	It means just halting this extraordinary assault
3254220	3255300	on the labor movement,
3255340	3258260	which by the way, the Labor Party is now considering
3258260	3261580	rowing back on the one little tiny thing it has left,
3261580	3264140	which is these promises on workers' rights,
3264140	3266900	which are barely even enough to begin with.
3266900	3271220	So like really just demanding the end of the assault
3271220	3275180	on workers' rights and like a strong assertion
3275180	3277500	of the right to unionize and collective bargaining
3277500	3279180	and all these sorts of different sorts of things.
3279180	3282020	That is a key pillar of democracy.
3282020	3283980	It is about demanding an end
3283980	3287940	to the astonishingly draconian rules against protest.
3287940	3290580	We've seen environmentalists being jailed
3290580	3292820	for trying to bring attention to the fact
3292820	3294980	that we are destroying the planet.
3296140	3297540	And we know that the Conservative government
3297540	3301540	has pushed loads of, they talk about free speech, right?
3301540	3304260	And like freedom of assembly and all these democratic rights,
3304260	3306980	and they're just constantly riding roughshod
3306980	3310100	over just like the most basic democratic principles.
3310940	3315620	It is about supporting community organizing,
3315620	3318540	about decentralization and allowing local people
3318540	3321460	to take power within their local communities.
3321460	3326460	And it is about also why does spread democratization
3327420	3329740	of the public sector or our politics?
3329740	3331700	That means that when we have to think about
3331700	3334380	how we run our public services,
3334380	3336900	rather than saying we're going to outsource running
3336900	3339180	of our health system and social care system
3339180	3341820	to capita, a giant multinational corporation
3341820	3344300	that is literally skimming money out of the pockets
3344300	3348820	of taxpayers and sucking up into those of shareholders.
3348820	3353260	Why couldn't we have a democratically run
3353260	3357180	public health care system or public services system?
3357180	3358420	There's a really interesting example
3358420	3360460	at the end of the book about Chile.
3360460	3362340	When Salvador Aende came to power,
3362340	3365140	and obviously he was just like, you know,
3365140	3366980	destroyed by the United States
3367020	3369740	for pushing this model of democratic socialism.
3369740	3372300	He said he didn't want to go for Soviet style centralization,
3372300	3376340	nor did he want to go for kind of for capitalism.
3376340	3378540	And instead he pushed this model
3378540	3379900	of democratic socialism,
3379900	3381300	which was extraordinarily popular.
3381300	3385020	And one pillar of that was how can we organize health care
3385020	3387980	based on existing community networks
3387980	3392380	and allowing like workers and patients
3392380	3393900	and people within that system a voice
3393900	3395540	as to how they were being treated, right?
3395540	3397500	There's a completely different model.
3397500	3400820	It's just, it requires like a complete rethink
3400820	3403220	as to how we imagine the relationship
3403220	3405380	between government and governed.
3405380	3408820	You know, an ideal liberal political philosophy,
3408820	3410500	government is supposed to be a representation
3410500	3411660	of our collective power.
3411660	3413620	It's supposed to be the mechanism
3413620	3414900	through which we all govern ourselves.
3414900	3416780	You know, the liberal theorists were like,
3416780	3418140	we were in the state of nature
3418140	3419420	and everyone was attacking each other.
3419420	3421620	So we all came together and decided to form a state.
3421620	3423500	That's obviously not what happened.
3423500	3426140	But like arguably the true realization
3426140	3427860	of the liberal dream is when government
3427860	3430060	can actually become a mechanism
3430060	3433060	through which we are all able to govern ourselves collectively
3433060	3434860	where we come together to make decisions
3434860	3438660	about the future of our society amongst ourselves
3438660	3441980	rather than electing people who tell us what to do.
3441980	3443540	Grace Blakely has been an utter pleasure.
3443540	3444740	Thank you so much for your time.
3444740	3446420	Vulture capitalism in all good bookshops.
3446420	3447260	Thank you.
3447260	3448100	Thank you.
3453500	3454340	Thank you.
