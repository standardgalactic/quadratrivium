00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
Wall Street and Big Tech and the City of London together own your identity.

00:04.240 --> 00:07.600
You have to pay to use your own identity.

00:07.600 --> 00:12.960
If we are going to defeat them, and if we're going to turn this into a viable society,

00:12.960 --> 00:18.480
the global society, we must forget about taxing, we must think in old Marxist terms,

00:18.480 --> 00:20.960
how do we take their capital away from them?

00:20.960 --> 00:23.440
This is not a viable system, it's a system we live in.

00:23.440 --> 00:26.720
We are stampeding towards oblivion.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.160
Janis Varivakis, hello, how are you?

00:28.800 --> 00:29.680
Very well.

00:29.680 --> 00:30.000
Good.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.120
I'm very happy to be here.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.080
Very happy to have you here.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.400
Before we get into the subject matter today, your book, Technofutilism,

00:37.360 --> 00:41.360
I'd invite you to tell the audience who you are, what you do, in your own words.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.720
Well, I used to be an academic that no one knew anything about because I was

00:48.560 --> 00:56.400
cocooned in my university office writing esoteric texts that maximum 20 people around

00:56.400 --> 01:02.400
the world cared for, and I didn't mind, until I started feeling in the early 2000s that the world

01:02.400 --> 01:11.280
is heading towards another 1929 discontinuity, let's put it mildly, and at that moment I thought that

01:11.280 --> 01:16.480
I don't have the right, the moral right to carry on playing around with my mathematical

01:16.480 --> 01:23.920
models of game theory, and I started writing fiery articles and books, including the Global

01:23.920 --> 01:29.840
Minotaur, which became quite a significant text, even if I'm saying so myself, regardless of 2008.

01:32.320 --> 01:38.080
It was a time when I was also shifting from Australia to my home country, Greece, which was

01:38.080 --> 01:48.160
always going to be ground zero of the European great financial crisis, and at some point

01:48.400 --> 01:56.880
having opened my mouth once too often and written too many articles about it, a young man who was

01:56.880 --> 02:04.960
leading the Greek opposition at the time, this is now 2010, 11, 12, 13, at some point invited me

02:04.960 --> 02:15.040
to become the finance minister if he were to win, which I did, and so from obscure mathematical

02:15.040 --> 02:21.440
texts I was elevated to becoming the finance minister of the most bankrupt state in Europe,

02:21.440 --> 02:28.720
the world, that lasted five, six months because we had a pact, the prime minister and myself,

02:28.720 --> 02:35.840
that we would never accept another bailout loan under conditions of crashing 80% of the population,

02:36.400 --> 02:44.160
he decided that he wanted to surrender, I decided I'm not going to surrender, and that's it, I resigned,

02:44.160 --> 02:51.920
and then created my own party, going from small victory to grand failure, writing books all the

02:51.920 --> 02:58.160
time as therapy, so that's why. Okay, perfect, let's indulge them in another hour of therapy,

02:58.160 --> 03:03.040
talking about this book, we're going to get into the concepts in it, we're going to go into it in

03:03.040 --> 03:08.960
detail, but top line for people who are just here to begin with, what's it about, why is it important,

03:08.960 --> 03:17.920
why should people read it? We all feel in our bones that this crisis is never ending, it is

03:17.920 --> 03:22.160
metamorphosizing, taking different, you know, from a crisis of deflation, falling prices and

03:22.160 --> 03:29.440
falling wages, it went to a crisis of the cost of living crisis, of inflation, we know that there's

03:29.440 --> 03:37.040
something dismally wrong with the world, that you know capitalism was always a system that produced

03:37.120 --> 03:45.280
crisis, and new funding forms of poverty and depravity, but what has been happening over the last

03:45.280 --> 03:55.200
15 years, excuse me, is unique, we haven't experienced that since the 1770s, 1780s, this

03:56.640 --> 04:02.000
so universal sense of angst that everybody shares, including of course about the climate,

04:02.800 --> 04:08.640
and my view is that the reason why we're experiencing this is not that capitalism is going through

04:08.640 --> 04:15.760
another one of its normal crisis, but rather we are at a turning point, very much like the 1770s,

04:15.760 --> 04:23.520
1780s, when there was a great transformation, as Karl Polanyi put it, from feudalism to capitalism,

04:23.520 --> 04:30.240
and the feudalism power sprang out of the land, anybody who owned land, the land of Gentry,

04:30.240 --> 04:36.640
had power, and it was all sorts of power packed in one, political power, economic power,

04:37.360 --> 04:43.920
cultural power, if you were the aristocracy or part of it, you had it, and you couldn't

04:43.920 --> 04:51.120
distinguish between political and economic power, and the wealth came out of rent, the rents that

04:51.120 --> 04:58.880
the aristocrats of the land of Gentry charged, vassals and peasants and so on, and then there is

04:58.880 --> 05:07.600
this great shift from land to machinery to capital, and from rent to profit through the

05:07.600 --> 05:14.320
commodification of land, the commodification of labor, even though peasants worked very hard,

05:14.320 --> 05:19.440
their labor was not a commodity, they couldn't quit, didn't receive a wage, it was no labor market,

05:19.440 --> 05:23.440
similarly for land, there was no market for land, you either had it or you didn't have it,

05:24.240 --> 05:29.200
and then everything was commodified, so that was capitalism, it starts here in this country

05:29.200 --> 05:34.080
and in Amsterdam around the end of the 18th century, and it continues to this day.

05:34.880 --> 05:42.400
Now, I mentioned before that it was in the 2000s that I was feeling that some major crisis was

05:42.400 --> 05:51.920
coming, and 2008, the city of London, Wall Street, so on, in my estimation, created a rupture in

05:51.920 --> 05:57.600
capitalism, it wasn't anything like, not even like 1929, it was even more substantial than that,

05:58.640 --> 06:02.080
and for a number of years I was trying to think about what on earth is happening,

06:02.960 --> 06:09.520
and I came to the very controversial conclusion, which is this book, that in the same way that

06:09.520 --> 06:14.480
we shifted from feudalism to capitalism, we are now shifting, without realizing it, to a new form

06:14.480 --> 06:18.640
of feudalism, a very advanced, almost science fiction form of feudalism, this is why I call it

06:18.720 --> 06:27.040
techno feudalism, but essentially, we have a new land, which is the cloud, and we have a new landed

06:27.040 --> 06:33.120
gentry, you can call them cloud delists, or the techno feudal lords, the lords of the cloud,

06:33.120 --> 06:40.880
like Jeff Bezos, just one example of Zuckerberg, and power is shifting from the owners of machinery,

06:40.880 --> 06:46.160
of standard machines, even industrial robots, even advanced machinery, to the owners of this

06:46.160 --> 06:54.400
network of machines that creates this digital version of land, and just one last point to explain

06:54.400 --> 07:01.040
to our audience what I mean by that, when you enter Amazon.com, or Alibaba, or one of those

07:01.040 --> 07:05.040
digital platforms, people think that they enter a marketplace, they do not enter a marketplace,

07:05.040 --> 07:10.720
they enter a digital fiefdom, because come to think of it, even though you buy yourself,

07:11.600 --> 07:17.120
it's all mediated by an algorithm that belongs to one person, who doesn't produce anything,

07:18.000 --> 07:26.080
except for this landscape. And how does Bezos make his billions? If you produce a book, or, you know,

07:27.200 --> 07:34.400
a bicycle, or anything that you sell through Amazon.com, he keeps 40%, that's a rent. Suddenly,

07:34.400 --> 07:40.960
we've gone from profits to rents, but this time, it's not rents that you charge for the use, or the

07:40.960 --> 07:46.720
leasing of land, but the leasing of the clouds, so I call them cloud rents. And the more I thought

07:46.720 --> 07:53.200
about that, the more I convinced myself that this is a great transformation, which is hugely important,

07:53.200 --> 08:02.000
not theoretically, but for me, the idea of the liberal individual gone. You can no longer be

08:02.640 --> 08:08.400
a genuine liberal, or even a libertarian, if I'm right. Social democracy gone, because what was

08:08.400 --> 08:13.760
social democracy? It was a kind of mediation between industrial capital and organized liberal

08:13.760 --> 08:21.520
gone, because industrial capital now is being exploited by those people. They get 40% of whatever

08:21.520 --> 08:27.440
it is that they produce, and no one is going to negotiate with Jeff Bezos. No government can make

08:28.160 --> 08:34.320
any group of workers sit down with Jeff Bezos, or they can't make Jeff Bezos sit down with any

08:34.320 --> 08:39.600
group of workers and carry out a social democratic bargain, or new deal, or whatever.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.880
And also, if you look at the clash between the United States and China, why is this happening?

08:46.080 --> 08:52.480
Taiwan is not the reason. Taiwan was always a problem. National security is not the reason.

08:52.480 --> 09:01.360
My view is that what you have is two kinds, two cloud fiefdoms clashing. The American one,

09:01.360 --> 09:07.280
based on Silicon Valley and Wall Street, and the Chinese one. Europe is non-existent,

09:07.280 --> 09:13.360
because we don't have a cloud. So anyway, that's the whole story, really.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.440
And we'll drill down their details in the book.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.160
Perfect. And we'll get into those details over the course of this conversation. Before we do get

09:20.160 --> 09:25.200
on to that subject matter, I'd like to loiter around this point about the end of capitalism,

09:25.200 --> 09:30.480
about what's killing capitalism, and whether or not you mentioned 2008, 2009. Is it fair to say

09:30.480 --> 09:34.240
whether actually capital is the force that's causing capitalism to come to an end at the moment?

09:34.240 --> 09:40.480
That's a great irony. I'm a Marxist, I'm a left-winger, full disclosure folks.

09:41.760 --> 09:44.560
And I remain a Marxist. And I think that this is a Marxist analysis.

09:44.960 --> 09:49.120
I mean, there's even an appendix with a Marxist political economy take for

09:49.680 --> 09:54.240
nerds. If you're a nerd Marxist and you want to look at what is the actual political,

09:54.240 --> 09:58.320
Marxist political economy behind this book, there's an appendix. You don't have to read it,

09:58.320 --> 10:02.400
but it's there for you to tell people that you read it.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.360
Yeah, of course.

10:05.600 --> 10:12.720
So I'm saying this because we of the left always imagined that we were brought to this earth

10:12.720 --> 10:20.080
by chance and nature and whatever, in order to overthrow capitalism. That capitalism will be

10:20.080 --> 10:27.120
overthrown by the organized left, by the organized labor unions. Didn't happen, we failed. We are

10:27.120 --> 10:31.680
dismal abysmal failures. No doubt about that, right? All of us. Yep.

10:34.880 --> 10:40.000
So what did the trick? Capital. Capital went through a historic mutation

10:40.960 --> 10:46.800
from a produced means of production. Because if you think about a fishing rod, a steam engine,

10:46.800 --> 10:52.720
an industrial robot, it's something we have produced in order to produce all this stuff.

10:52.720 --> 11:00.800
It's a produced means of production. But cloud capital is a produced means of behavior modification.

11:02.000 --> 11:07.920
That's very different. So effectively, you've taken the, if you remember Mad Men, the wonderful

11:07.920 --> 11:12.720
television series and Don Draper, right? So you automate Don Draper. You turn him into Alexa.

11:14.160 --> 11:18.640
And he does much more than simply put ideas into your mind as to what you want. Firstly,

11:19.200 --> 11:26.320
it trains you to train it, to train you to train it, to input into your mind preferences.

11:27.360 --> 11:29.840
And at the same time, the moment you have that preference for something,

11:30.480 --> 11:34.000
that need for some good, it sells it to you by passing all markets.

11:34.080 --> 11:39.440
In that sense, capital has over the capitalism.

11:40.960 --> 11:46.160
So talk about this Amazon Alexa example a little bit more, because this cloud capital

11:46.160 --> 11:52.160
idea is what underpins techno feudalism, right? How does it differ from traditional capital?

11:52.160 --> 11:58.480
You covered it just a little bit. And also, how does it turn us, the user, if you like,

11:58.480 --> 12:01.120
into the serfs of feudalism past?

12:02.880 --> 12:10.560
Advertisers have always been in the business of indoctrinating us, right? Of putting ideas,

12:10.560 --> 12:17.280
of manufacturing desires in our soul. This is the major transformation, transition

12:17.280 --> 12:22.000
from early capitalism to more advanced monopoly capitalism after the Second World War.

12:22.880 --> 12:28.400
In the 19th century, the capitalism that Adam Smith was talking about was all about producing

12:28.480 --> 12:37.040
bread and, you know, ale and meat and carriages and horse manure and stuff, things that people

12:37.040 --> 12:42.880
needed through a market-based mechanism for distributing productive resources.

12:45.120 --> 12:49.840
And using the price mechanism in order to equilibrate demand and supply and all that.

12:49.840 --> 12:55.200
That's before the war. After the war, you've got the big conglomerates in the United States,

12:55.200 --> 13:00.960
primarily, that emerged from the war economy. They have this huge, immense productive capacity.

13:00.960 --> 13:06.160
They can produce a lot more washing machines that American families wanted. So they had to find

13:06.160 --> 13:14.560
markets outside. And they needed to manufacture desires in our soul for the things that they

13:14.560 --> 13:18.160
could produce, because they could produce a lot more than what we needed. So they had to convince

13:18.160 --> 13:24.320
us that we needed more than we needed. And that's von Draper. That's advertising, right?

13:24.320 --> 13:28.640
But that was human beings. It was a new profession, the purpose of which was to convince you to buy

13:28.640 --> 13:37.200
stuff. One way street. Don Draper comes up with an idea, wonderful poster on the motorway. You sit,

13:37.200 --> 13:43.040
you say, I want that, then you go and buy it. Okay. Still a very significant change back in the 50s,

13:43.040 --> 13:53.840
60s, 70s and so on. Today, what you have is Alexa sitting on your desk or Siri on your phone

13:53.840 --> 14:02.800
or Google Assistant, all those contraptions, which present themselves as your slaves. So you say, you

14:02.800 --> 14:15.040
know, set the alarm clock for 1035, order milk, tell me a story, play music, stream a video,

14:15.040 --> 14:20.880
all those things. So it's great. I mean, I'm addicted to all those machines, right? I'm not a

14:20.880 --> 14:28.160
Luddite or a neo Luddite by any stage of the imagination. But that's not what Alexa is.

14:28.880 --> 14:34.640
Alexa is an interface with cloud capital belonging to one man or to a few men, usually men.

14:37.360 --> 14:44.960
And what you do is you give it information about yourself. So you train it so that it knows you.

14:45.920 --> 14:51.680
And then it starts giving you recommendations about books to read, pieces of music to listen to,

14:51.680 --> 14:57.360
films to watch, which are spore on. I don't know about you, but when Spotify recommends music,

14:57.360 --> 15:04.160
it's usually music I like. When Amazon recommends books, it's always books I want to read. It knows

15:04.160 --> 15:10.160
me, right? Which is very impressive. And we are impressionable people. So when Alexa recommends

15:10.240 --> 15:15.120
something to me day after in day out that I want, at some point, when she recommends something else,

15:15.120 --> 15:21.920
I will want it or I will at least buy it. And it will always be quite close, not exactly what I

15:21.920 --> 15:31.680
would have selected without her, her of it, but quite close, right? So this is a two way street.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.960
This is an infinite regress. I tell it things so that you can tell me things so I can tell

15:37.120 --> 15:45.040
things and therefore it acquires a great deal of power over my thinking and my preferences

15:45.040 --> 15:51.600
and my desires and my aspirations even. And the most important thing here is that it is the same

15:51.600 --> 15:57.280
software, the same mechanism, not just software, warehousing and all that, that can actually send

15:57.280 --> 16:03.600
it to me directly by passing any capitalist. The capitalist then becomes a vessel to that.

16:03.600 --> 16:11.360
So this is what is so different to Don Draper. Don Draper could not sell you anything

16:11.920 --> 16:16.640
himself. He could convince you to go into the shops and buy it. And one final thing.

16:18.000 --> 16:25.440
There isn't why this cloud capital in my book and in my mind is very different to very advanced

16:25.440 --> 16:31.280
pieces of technology like rockets or industrial robots, which are also very advanced contraptions.

16:31.280 --> 16:38.640
But the great difference is that capital until now required waged labor to be created.

16:39.360 --> 16:44.240
So from the steam engines to the industrial robots today, there were workers, there are workers,

16:44.240 --> 16:50.320
in factories, together with machines and other robots and other pieces of produced means of

16:50.320 --> 16:56.160
production that actually build the stuff. So you need a capitalist who employs labor, machinery,

16:57.120 --> 17:03.840
buildings, electricity, technology and so on to produce the capital, not Amazon.com,

17:04.400 --> 17:11.200
not cloud capital. Most of cloud capital is produced by me and you because you know that very well

17:11.200 --> 17:20.960
that why can't we compete with Elon Musk's former Twitter ex, even if you and I were great coders

17:20.960 --> 17:31.040
and produced such a network, such a piece of software for short form debating, which is much

17:31.040 --> 17:37.120
better than Twitter, even if we did. Who would join it? Yeah, all our followers are on Twitter.

17:37.680 --> 17:49.840
Ex, I can't say it. So the capital of ex is us and all our tweets. Amazon.com, every time you

17:49.840 --> 17:56.960
buy something or you like something or you upload a review of some book or some product,

17:56.960 --> 18:02.960
you're adding to the capital stock. So we are creating the, you know, a large part of cloud

18:02.960 --> 18:09.200
capital. So cloud capital is a new form of capital because of the way it reproduces itself.

18:10.080 --> 18:16.480
It can reproduce itself using self labor by people who don't even know themselves. So that's why I

18:16.480 --> 18:21.920
call them called us cloud serves because we do all this work. Even if we don't do anything,

18:21.920 --> 18:27.440
just we have our phone on us and we're walking around London, Google Maps knows where we are

18:27.440 --> 18:34.880
and that enriches its capacity. It's cloud capital for telling people where it's congested,

18:34.880 --> 18:40.480
where they shouldn't go, whether, you know, this shop is a popular one or less popular one.

18:41.280 --> 18:50.320
So capital that produces and that produces itself, that is a major discontinuity in the

18:50.320 --> 18:54.400
development of our technologies and the socioeconomic system we live in.

18:54.400 --> 18:58.240
We'll talk about this point in more detail in a moment, I think, because it's interesting that

18:59.120 --> 19:05.440
Shoshana Zuboff in surveillance capitalism, she argues that those inputs, those behavioral

19:05.440 --> 19:09.840
or activities that the companies then monetize, that it forms part of a new capitalist system,

19:09.840 --> 19:12.960
it doesn't go as far as saying feudalism, but maybe we can talk about that in a moment.

19:12.960 --> 19:17.840
But I just wanted to pick you up on, you referred to Alexa as she instead of it.

19:20.880 --> 19:26.000
And I wonder, maybe you do, maybe you don't, maybe this question goes nowhere, what role

19:26.000 --> 19:32.720
sort of the anthropomorphizing these technologies have of turning them into people,

19:32.720 --> 19:36.160
of turning Alexa into a woman, of turning Syria where you can tell Syria to be, whoever you want

19:36.400 --> 19:41.280
to be, but I wonder if you, whether you think that's significant or perhaps you don't, I don't know.

19:41.280 --> 19:47.200
Of course it is significant. The greater the capacity of the machines to present themselves

19:47.200 --> 19:55.680
as humans, the greater the power of this infinite regress where we're training to train us,

19:55.680 --> 20:00.800
to train it, to train us and so on and so forth. Now you mentioned Zuboff and, you know,

20:00.880 --> 20:06.320
an important book, Surveillance Capitalism, from which I've learned and which I think is an important

20:07.120 --> 20:12.640
part of the story, but doesn't go far enough because it continues to treat those corporations

20:12.640 --> 20:19.520
as monopoly capitalists. Now Henry Ford, Thomas Edison were monopoly capitalists.

20:19.520 --> 20:24.560
They had created network companies. I mean Thomas Edison was the Elon Musk of his era.

20:24.560 --> 20:31.360
Think about it. In the early years, the first decade, 1903, 1904,

20:31.360 --> 20:37.600
he actually electrocuted a hapless elephant at Coney Island in order to demonstrate

20:38.720 --> 20:43.680
that the electricity, the alternative current that he used which belonged to Westinghouse,

20:43.680 --> 20:50.400
which was coming out of a Westinghouse powerhouse, was lethal because he was selling a direct

20:50.400 --> 20:57.920
current which would not have killed the elephant or a human being. So concentrated power, huge

20:57.920 --> 21:05.920
egos, new fungal technologies. This is all new and the capacity of those people, especially Henry

21:05.920 --> 21:13.680
Ford, to monopolize markets through technological advancement and to create desires into people's

21:13.680 --> 21:20.720
minds, desires they didn't know they had. This is not new. It's there. Of course, Big Tech has

21:20.720 --> 21:30.320
turbocharged it and it is true that they have such direct access through Alexa and Siri and so on

21:30.320 --> 21:37.840
and our phones really, our tablets, to us that that monopoly power, the capacity to monopolize

21:37.840 --> 21:45.200
a market is now much greater than it was before the Second World War. However, where I go

21:46.400 --> 21:55.840
further is that I'm making the point that Amazon.com and thousands of such companies now

21:55.840 --> 22:03.040
all over the world, in Indonesia, in Malaysia, especially in Africa, this shift from the market

22:03.040 --> 22:12.480
to digital platforms, these digital platforms are not markets and the, I mean, Ford, how did he

22:12.480 --> 22:18.800
make his money? Selling cars. He made the cars and sold them to you. Now the owners of these platforms

22:19.680 --> 22:27.360
of the cloud do not make anything. They are go-betweens. They are essentially renters

22:28.240 --> 22:33.520
and you might say, well, why don't we call it an entire capitalism? Well, we could. In the same way

22:33.520 --> 22:39.600
we could call capitalism industrial feudalism. It wouldn't be wrong, but it wouldn't allow our

22:39.600 --> 22:45.360
minds to concentrate on the fact that here is a great transformation to another social system which

22:46.000 --> 22:52.800
relies on rents, not on monopoly profits. That's the great difference with Ford, the great difference

22:52.880 --> 22:58.640
with Hilton, the great difference with McDonald's. All those people actually produced goods and

22:58.640 --> 23:06.320
services that they monopolized and convinced you you really needed them. Basis and the rest

23:06.960 --> 23:17.360
do not produce anything. They are creating a new kind of rent which sucks the economic energy

23:18.000 --> 23:25.280
out of the capital sector which is now becoming a vessel to their own cloud-based empire.

23:25.280 --> 23:28.720
I think that's a different story. Let's talk about those technological advancements then.

23:29.840 --> 23:34.320
Specifically, which ones you think were integral to cloud capital first emerging and also

23:34.960 --> 23:39.760
where they came from? Where are they based? Where do these technological advancements start?

23:40.320 --> 23:44.240
They start with the development of algorithms that could actually improve themselves.

23:45.200 --> 23:54.000
When I was a student ages ago, algorithms were dumb. They were like recipes. You take this

23:54.000 --> 23:59.760
ingredient, that ingredient, you mix them together, then if this happens then you do that, if the

23:59.760 --> 24:07.920
other happens then you do something else. That's how programs learned how to produce good statistics,

24:08.880 --> 24:15.920
solve mathematical problems, create Excel. These were dumb algorithms.

24:17.680 --> 24:23.760
The moment you have reinforced learning in algorithms, so you have algorithms that do not have

24:25.040 --> 24:32.400
set objectives. They have a variety of objectives that the algorithm can select from. It's a little

24:32.400 --> 24:43.760
like telling a chef, prepare a dish of meat lasagna. But the same thing, if in the process

24:43.760 --> 24:49.520
you realize that the quality of the meat is not what it should be, you can change your objective.

24:50.240 --> 24:57.520
And then going beyond that, algorithms that could monitor their own efficiency and could

24:57.600 --> 25:04.640
change, alter their own functioning in order to become more efficient. That's the beginning of

25:04.640 --> 25:12.640
artificial intelligence. And of course now with generative learning and large language models,

25:15.600 --> 25:24.720
at some point, this Hegelian dialectical idea, quantitative changes led to qualitative changes

25:24.720 --> 25:30.960
in the same way that when you lose your hair, which hair must you lose before you declare bold?

25:31.520 --> 25:36.000
There's no answer to that. But there is a point when at some point people say, oh, you're bolder,

25:36.000 --> 25:44.880
right? Speaking from experience. Similarly, at some point, I can't pinpoint precisely when

25:44.880 --> 25:52.240
the development of algorithms and their capacity to improve themselves and learn from themselves

25:52.240 --> 25:57.200
and alter their own substance. At some point, this was a singularity. Not that they became

25:58.080 --> 26:04.560
sentient. They never did. And I don't believe they ever will. But okay, this is science fiction.

26:05.520 --> 26:14.480
At some point, they managed to acquire this capacity to do that which Cloud Capital does

26:14.480 --> 26:19.680
in my book. And I think what's important as well, and you point out in the book,

26:19.680 --> 26:24.000
is that the consequences that technical feudalism isn't actually inevitable

26:24.000 --> 26:27.280
as a result of those technological advancements, that the political and social conditions

26:27.920 --> 26:31.680
were absolutely crucial. Yes. So what are those social and political conditions?

26:31.680 --> 26:39.200
Two. The first one was the privatization of the internet. Because internet one, the first

26:39.200 --> 26:44.800
internet that came out of the military industrial complex in the United States, the Pentagon,

26:45.200 --> 26:51.760
when they brought in research scientists from the universities and all sorts of enthusiasts,

26:52.320 --> 26:56.480
coders, to contribute to the creation of the original internet, it was a commons.

26:57.360 --> 27:04.960
It had nothing to do with capitalism. So to this day, when you read a website, you use this

27:04.960 --> 27:12.480
HTTP ancient language, computer language, right? But that's somebody created that,

27:12.480 --> 27:18.880
which allows us to read websites. That person didn't get a penny for it. It was a contribution

27:18.880 --> 27:24.640
to the commons, to the internet commons. Similarly, with the various ancient technologies

27:24.640 --> 27:30.080
still used to send and receive emails, SMTP and so on, you may have seen those. Those were all

27:31.200 --> 27:37.120
protocols created by enthusiasts who were rewarded in a variety of ways, but not monetized.

27:38.080 --> 27:42.400
So the first internet, I remember it, I was using the internet before it was called the internet,

27:42.400 --> 27:48.880
it was called Janet. Do you know that? Joint academic network before it was called the internet,

27:49.520 --> 27:52.000
at least in this country, it was called Janet. What were you using it for?

27:53.360 --> 28:02.000
Well, initially, to exchange data with other academic researchers. And emails were called

28:02.000 --> 28:09.040
batch files, because you would create a little batch of messages and put them into a file. And

28:09.040 --> 28:16.320
that file would then be readable in America by some colleague there. But it was a commons. It

28:16.320 --> 28:21.760
was like the commons before the enclosures. So we had a new enclosures with Big Tech after 2001.

28:22.720 --> 28:33.840
And the most important development there is that they owned and privatized your identity. You cannot

28:33.840 --> 28:41.520
prove who you are on the internet today. You've got subcontractor identity from large corporations.

28:41.520 --> 28:51.040
So a bank knows who you are, right? So it can vouch on the internet through codes that it shares

28:51.040 --> 28:58.880
with Google or Apple, because how does Apple know that it's you? It asks you to input your data from

28:58.880 --> 29:03.760
your credit card or your debit card, so they take it from the bank. So Wall Street and Big Tech

29:03.760 --> 29:11.760
and the City of London together own your identity. You have to pay to use your own identity.

29:11.760 --> 29:16.400
That's the privatization of not just the commons, but of yourself, of the individual.

29:17.360 --> 29:23.040
To this day, there's no way you can say it's me. Here's proof that it's me. The state could have

29:23.040 --> 29:31.040
done that. The state could have certified who you are and given you a long number, which is you

29:31.040 --> 29:35.120
and a pin number to certify that, but the state doesn't do that. It leaves it to the private

29:35.120 --> 29:43.600
sector, to the concomitants. So that's one. The second development, which created techno feudalism,

29:43.600 --> 29:52.720
that spawned huge quantities and qualities of cloud capital, was the response by our governments

29:52.720 --> 30:00.080
and central banks to the 2008 crisis, because after April 2009, I don't know if you do remember

30:00.080 --> 30:05.120
that there was this meeting here in London presided over by Gordon Brown of the G7,

30:06.640 --> 30:13.280
essentially decided to refloat finance, to bail out the bankers worldwide, and they printed

30:13.280 --> 30:24.240
together over 13 years, $35 trillion, and they gave you the finances. At the same time, the

30:24.240 --> 30:29.520
practice of austerity here in Britain, in Greece, across the European Union, in the United States,

30:29.520 --> 30:36.720
austerity for the many, and socialism for the financiers. Now, why is this connected to cloud

30:36.720 --> 30:42.320
capital? Because when you create all this amount, huge quantity of money, which circulates,

30:42.320 --> 30:48.400
sloshes around the circuits of finance, but people are there, have no money because of austerity,

30:48.400 --> 30:54.960
and they can't buy anything. Industrialists, the captains of industry and so on,

30:57.280 --> 31:02.240
take Volkswagen for instance, right, or General Motors, they look at the little people and say,

31:02.880 --> 31:08.320
as if they can afford to buy something like Google and Tesla. We're not going to invest in it.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.120
We're not going to mass produce goods that these people won't be able to buy,

31:11.760 --> 31:14.720
but they have all this money because the central banks have printed it and given it to the

31:14.720 --> 31:18.960
financiers. The financiers want to give it to these industrialists, so the industrialists think

31:18.960 --> 31:26.240
Apple has $200 billion, $200 billion of savings. Now, why do they want money from the central bank

31:26.240 --> 31:30.560
if they have savings? They don't, but the central bank picks up the phone and says,

31:30.560 --> 31:34.720
I'm going to give it to you for free. So, Apple says, all right, give it to them, and you know what

31:34.720 --> 31:40.640
they do? They go to the stock exchange and buy Apple shares. The share price goes up,

31:40.640 --> 31:44.160
their bonuses are linked to the share price, they're taking more money.

31:46.240 --> 31:55.120
Mr. Cook and the rest, Steve Jobs before, the only ones who took this money and invested it

31:56.160 --> 32:03.840
were the ones who invested in cloud capital, the Jeff Bezos and so on. There is no doubt that

32:03.840 --> 32:08.960
all the money that has gone into creating the optic fiber cables criss-crossing the oceans,

32:08.960 --> 32:14.000
the server farms, the algorithms, the AI and so on,

32:16.400 --> 32:24.640
nine out of ten dollars or pounds spent on that came from the huge quantities of money

32:24.640 --> 32:34.240
printed by the central banks, by the states. So, the awful response by our governments

32:34.880 --> 32:43.440
to the 2008 disaster was part and parcel of what created the UMPH, the funding for the cloud

32:43.440 --> 32:48.480
capital that now is taking over the world. It's interesting, actually, we had Mariano

32:48.480 --> 32:52.320
Mazzucato in here recently talking about the state's role, I'm sure you know the book,

32:52.320 --> 32:56.320
The Entrepreneurial State, right, and the state's role often in being the first mover for a lot

32:56.320 --> 33:00.640
of this stuff, socializing the risk, accepting the risk of, let's say, creating the technology we

33:00.640 --> 33:05.040
needed to put a man on the moon. But then, at the end, it's the private company who reaps the

33:05.040 --> 33:08.800
rewards, it's the private company who takes the profits and the risk is socialized, the

33:08.800 --> 33:15.520
profits are privatized. I wonder what you're reading on the states in quotes, not the United

33:15.520 --> 33:23.200
States, I mean, a nation state's role is in establishing technofutilism and whether or not

33:23.200 --> 33:28.160
you view that relationship between the likes of a musk, a Bezos, as a parasitic one, that they are

33:28.160 --> 33:31.840
sort of benefiting from the investment that a state has made in the past.

33:33.760 --> 33:42.960
Look, Mariano's thesis is absolutely correct. For decades, the military industrial complex,

33:43.760 --> 33:52.400
the state has been central in investing and guiding the investing and having, you know,

33:52.400 --> 34:02.480
good civil servants. I'll use a term of abuse or phrase that neoliberals use to abuse the state,

34:02.480 --> 34:06.960
picking winners and decided that they're going to build the internet. The internet was not,

34:06.960 --> 34:12.000
didn't spontaneously emerge. It was a decision of some people in the Pentagon to create the

34:12.000 --> 34:17.520
internet for military purposes, but nevertheless, it did not come out of the marketplace.

34:18.480 --> 34:25.040
And then the state comes in and invests. Every technology in your iPhone or your Samsung phone

34:25.040 --> 34:32.400
or whatever was invented as a result of some government grant, which was directed in that Wi-Fi

34:33.200 --> 34:38.560
came out of the CSIRO in Australia. What did the Australian government get for that? Zero,

34:38.560 --> 34:46.720
because it was offered to the commons. Same with GPS. GPS was given for free. They could have

34:46.720 --> 34:54.000
charged for it, but they gave it away for free. And then these companies that privatize the cloud,

34:54.000 --> 35:00.720
privatize the internet, that's the Mariano Mazzucato story, then also privatize the returns

35:01.360 --> 35:06.880
and use it in order to exert more power. And to deplete the capacity of the state to continue

35:06.880 --> 35:12.640
doing that, which is like an idiot who sits on a branch of a tree and starts sowing the branch,

35:13.200 --> 35:17.840
that I think is more or less the Mariano Mazzucato story. It's a good one, and I agree with that.

35:18.880 --> 35:31.520
But as part of the same story comes my story, because by effectively emptying the state of content,

35:32.240 --> 35:38.000
of, you know, deprofessionalizing the state, shifting everything to the private sector,

35:38.080 --> 35:45.280
subcontracting everything to those conglomerates, the state created a much greater crisis in 2008

35:46.080 --> 35:55.360
that would have happened had the state not done this. And then the private sector that was supposed

35:55.360 --> 36:01.920
to know better, that's the neoliberal story, right, that the market knows best, collapsed under the

36:01.920 --> 36:09.200
weight of its own stupidity and criminality. That was the case in 2008. And a hapless,

36:10.160 --> 36:14.640
vacuous state, a state that doesn't have the expertise that it once had. This is the problem

36:14.640 --> 36:19.440
we have today, you know. The state does not, why do you think the HS2 is not going to be built?

36:19.440 --> 36:23.920
Because the state doesn't have any civil servants who know how to plan the construction of a major

36:23.920 --> 36:32.800
project anymore. They've subcontracted everything. But still, they are responsible for saving capitalism

36:32.800 --> 36:37.680
for itself in 2008, 2009, under Gordon Branson. So what do they do? They do the only thing they

36:37.680 --> 36:42.640
know how to do, which is to print huge quantities of money and give it to the same people who

36:42.640 --> 36:49.360
destroyed, nearly destroyed capitalism in 2008. And then what do they do? They give it away,

36:49.360 --> 36:54.960
most people, most companies like Volkswagen and Ford and so on, go and buy back their own shares,

36:54.960 --> 36:59.920
except for some really smart people like Zuckerberg, Bezos, Musk and so on, who take the money,

36:59.920 --> 37:03.680
and they are the only ones who invest. And I wouldn't call them parasites, you know.

37:04.400 --> 37:10.800
I mean, I dislike all of them. But the person I consider a little must be an evil genius.

37:11.360 --> 37:17.920
The emphasis on the genius, though, he's absolutely, spectacularly smart in the way that

37:17.920 --> 37:26.240
SpaceX. He beat NASA on its own game. He actually created spaceships that can actually land

37:26.240 --> 37:34.240
on their bottom, right, without being destroyed. You know, that's not to be scoffed at. So these people

37:36.000 --> 37:42.240
created capital goods, what I call cloud capital, which is wonderful that we have it. I mean, I'm

37:42.240 --> 37:47.360
all in favor of artificial intelligence. You know, when I spent the summer translating this book

37:47.360 --> 37:54.720
using depot, and of course, working on top of it, I loved it. You know, I'm addicted to my phone

37:54.720 --> 37:59.680
and to Google and to all those things. No, Facebook, I hate them, but that's my problem.

38:00.800 --> 38:06.480
I use Twitter all the time, even though it's like, who put it that way? I can't remember.

38:06.480 --> 38:11.120
You said it magnificently. It's like taking everything that's written on the walls of

38:11.120 --> 38:16.000
mail toilets all over the world and putting it online. But nevertheless, you know, when I want

38:16.000 --> 38:19.040
to publicize my book, I use Twitter when I want to have a political fight with somebody,

38:19.040 --> 38:24.480
have it over Twitter. I'm not saying that they are useless. I'm not saying that they are parasitical.

38:24.480 --> 38:30.320
What I'm saying is that the form of capital, which is creating a new socioeconomic order,

38:30.320 --> 38:35.600
which is not viable, and it's not the fault of the machinery. It is not the fault of the technologies.

38:37.600 --> 38:43.680
It is who owns them. But that is a Marxist critique of capitalism to begin with. The problem is not

38:43.680 --> 38:50.160
the machine. The problem is who owns the machines and who doesn't have access to them unless they

38:50.160 --> 38:54.960
provide free labor or very cheap labor in the case of capitalism, free labor in the case of

38:54.960 --> 38:59.920
techno feudalism. Let's talk about that order a little bit more then. We've named the individuals

38:59.920 --> 39:06.000
that sort of the cloud lists the people that could be said to form our new ruling class.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.760
Let's talk, could you talk a little bit more, I should say, about how their rise and their supremacy

39:11.760 --> 39:17.600
then places people like you and me as serfs in that system, how that dynamic works?

39:21.040 --> 39:30.160
The moment they can create a cloud thief, which attracts us, because let's face it,

39:30.160 --> 39:38.800
if I want to buy a book quickly, which I can't find on bookshop.co.uk, I'll go to Amazon

39:39.760 --> 39:44.000
especially if I need to read something quickly and get it on Kindle. I go to the page, the relevant

39:44.000 --> 39:51.040
page, if I'm writing an op-ed for the newspaper, I do it. So they create a cloud thief, which you

39:51.040 --> 39:58.800
really need and want to be on. Once you're on it, you are helping without realizing it, reproduce

39:59.360 --> 40:06.000
its capital stock, the capital stock that gives it power over you. So you are a serf without knowing

40:06.000 --> 40:11.520
it, a voluntary serf, but of course the worst slavery is the one that people volunteer for.

40:14.240 --> 40:27.200
Jeff Bezos then can use the attractiveness of this cloud thief essentially to siphon off the

40:27.200 --> 40:35.520
capitalist sector, most of the profits, because when you chance 40% rent for anything sold on

40:35.520 --> 40:42.960
your cloud thief, then essentially you decimate the profit basis of the capitalist. So the capitalist,

40:42.960 --> 40:48.000
the standard capitalist, the old-fashioned capitalist, becomes a vessel to the cloud

40:48.000 --> 40:55.520
capitalist or cloud-alist, I'll call them cloud-alists for short. We are cloud serfs to them.

40:56.880 --> 41:04.640
In the Amazon warehouse, the people who work there as precarious, they don't have any rights

41:04.640 --> 41:13.040
really, they're precarious labor, nomad land. Watch the movie if you haven't, you see what I mean.

41:14.160 --> 41:20.080
They have electronic devices strapped to the wrist, which monitor their every move, tell them

41:21.840 --> 41:33.120
which part of the warehouse to go to next, what box to pick up. So they are cloud trolls.

41:33.120 --> 41:41.520
I mean, if you've seen the wonderful movie Modern Times by Charlie Chaplin, what he depicts there

41:41.520 --> 41:48.400
is now full-on through the cloud, because it's the same cloud capital that connects

41:49.200 --> 41:57.200
Alexa on your desktop, your laptop which creates cloud capital or recreates the cloud capital

41:57.200 --> 42:07.200
of Amazon.com, the software that drives proletarians or precariously employed workers in the warehouse,

42:07.200 --> 42:13.840
the drivers who are delivering the stuff. This is all a new form of

42:14.640 --> 42:22.320
mutant capital, which I call cloud capital, which also puts the lid on the profitability

42:22.320 --> 42:26.800
of the capitalist class, which means that because these people never pay tax,

42:27.360 --> 42:33.520
that states will always be impoverished, states will then have to increase VAT,

42:34.800 --> 42:41.520
which is the most regressive tax. So, you know, it's the plot thickens. It becomes a completely

42:41.520 --> 42:48.720
different kind of system. One could call it rentier capital capitalism or platform capitalism,

42:48.720 --> 42:56.160
but I insist on shifting away from the word capitalism, because it will help us concentrate

42:56.160 --> 43:01.840
our mind on what the gigantic transformation is, the equivalent of moving from feudalism to

43:01.840 --> 43:07.440
capitalism. Do you think we'll ever be able to tax them effectively? No. Why? Well, because they're

43:07.440 --> 43:12.960
too smart and they have better accountants than the government has, and they can shift from one

43:12.960 --> 43:24.800
country to another. And it is impossible to create the state power, or recreate the state power,

43:25.360 --> 43:35.360
against their own cloudless power, to defeat them legally in terms of accounting, in terms of how

43:35.360 --> 43:40.240
they managed to push their profits from one jurisdiction to the other until it lands in

43:40.240 --> 43:49.040
some jurisdiction where no corporate tax is being levied. If we're going to defeat them,

43:49.920 --> 43:55.280
and if we're going to turn this into a viable society, the global society, we must forget

43:55.280 --> 44:02.560
about taxing them. We must think in old Marxist terms, how do we take their cloud capital away

44:02.560 --> 44:10.640
from them? And how do we socialize it? So it's easier to imagine the end of the private property

44:10.640 --> 44:17.840
of cloud capital than it is to imagine the proper taxation of cloud rents. Well, go on to that in a

44:17.840 --> 44:24.480
moment. We'll talk about viable alternatives. What a more progressive, call it a utopia future,

44:24.480 --> 44:29.920
whatever you like, looks like. However, is there, do you find it compelling to suggest,

44:30.320 --> 44:35.200
I sit here in this conversation with you and I go, Janice, you know what? I don't want anything to

44:35.200 --> 44:38.640
do with this. I'm getting rid of my phone. I'm getting rid of my laptop and I'm going to go and

44:38.640 --> 44:42.480
live in a cabin in the woods and grow my own vegetables. Forget about it. See you later. I

44:42.480 --> 44:47.680
don't want to engage. How do you answer that criticism? How do you try and compel people to

44:47.680 --> 44:53.440
not go, God, this is the power, the wealth of the forces we're up against is so significant

44:53.440 --> 44:58.720
that I just don't have the appetite to try and combat it? There aren't enough good and huts for

44:58.720 --> 45:04.880
all of us to do that. And I don't believe you will do it. You may claim, you may feel desperate

45:04.880 --> 45:09.360
and you may think that this is a lost cause and you may say that, oh, I'm going to do that,

45:09.360 --> 45:14.080
but you're not going to do it. Even if you do it, you know, two months later, you'll come back,

45:14.080 --> 45:22.160
you will crawl back into London using your phone again. So, you know, an escape to a

45:22.160 --> 45:31.200
eucolic past that never really existed is not the solution. Is it possible though to opt out?

45:31.200 --> 45:35.680
Maybe not in the way I've just described, but you know, you talked earlier about the way these

45:35.680 --> 45:40.000
companies co-opt or identities. Is it possible for us to opt out of that process? Is it possible

45:40.000 --> 45:44.800
for us to steal back what belongs to us? It's like saying, is it possible for somebody who comes from

45:44.800 --> 45:52.240
rags to end up with riches? The answer is yes, but only if it's one person or a handful of persons.

45:52.240 --> 45:57.760
A handful of persons could rise from rags to riches. They can go from being, you know,

45:57.760 --> 46:04.000
Amazon warehouse workers to being cloudless. No doubt. No doubt. There is this degree of

46:04.000 --> 46:11.760
social mobility, but it is impossible for society to escape as a society from techno feudalism.

46:12.560 --> 46:17.440
You mentioned at the beginning the geopolitics or the conflict Cold War,

46:17.440 --> 46:22.560
whatever you like, between the United States and China, and that it's wrong to understand that conflict

46:23.120 --> 46:27.360
as a sort of traditional geopolitical game, but instead as a conflict between two

46:28.320 --> 46:32.960
superpower cloud fiefs. So, please, can you talk about that a little bit more? And I guess I'd

46:32.960 --> 46:41.680
ask you, glibly, as well, who's winning that war? Okay. Before I answer the second part, let me

46:41.680 --> 46:49.680
explain what I mean. The rise of China is an American story in the same way that the creation

46:49.680 --> 46:55.760
of the European Union is an American project. We Europeans like to think that we had a fantastic

46:55.760 --> 47:01.680
idea to end the war in Europe. We had that idea, but the EU would never have been great without

47:01.680 --> 47:09.200
Americans planning and executing the plan for the creation of the EU. Similarly, the rise of

47:09.200 --> 47:15.120
China, okay, thanks to being played an important role by opening up, but what happened essentially

47:15.120 --> 47:21.360
was this. There was a dark deal, I call it in the book, between the United States

47:22.320 --> 47:24.320
ruling class and the Chinese Communist Party.

47:25.120 --> 47:33.280
Industry would shift from the United States manufacturing to China.

47:36.640 --> 47:41.280
China would be the Chinese capitalists would be exporting to the United States.

47:42.880 --> 47:47.200
They would be getting paid in dollars that the United States would have to print

47:48.160 --> 47:52.480
because the United States was a deficit country, remains a deficit country,

47:53.200 --> 47:59.200
but that deficit would be sustainable. Why? Because all the profits, the dollar profits,

48:00.080 --> 48:04.400
or the vast majority of the dollar profits of the Chinese capitalist would go to Wall Street

48:04.400 --> 48:13.760
and be invested in real estate, in shares, in derivatives, and in bonds. In other words,

48:13.760 --> 48:18.400
a large part of the Chinese profits from selling to the United States would be financing the American

48:18.400 --> 48:25.680
government. That's a synergy. They are accomplices. The Chinese Communist Party and the American

48:25.680 --> 48:35.920
rentier capitalist are partners. So why are they now moving apart and threatening the world with

48:35.920 --> 48:45.360
Armageddon with a new Cold War that may end up into a thermonuclear war? That question was in my

48:46.320 --> 48:51.520
mind for a very long time and I didn't have an answer to it until I noticed WeChat.

48:52.960 --> 48:59.280
WeChat is an application that belongs to Tencent, a conglomerate, a big tech

49:00.640 --> 49:07.520
megalith in China. I realized that the West doesn't have anything like that. Imagine

49:08.560 --> 49:14.640
if there was an app, and by the way, that's what Elon Musk wants to do when he calls an

49:14.640 --> 49:20.080
everything app. That's WeChat. Imagine there is an app that allows you to send messages,

49:21.120 --> 49:28.640
watch TikTok-like videos, watch movies, listen to music, everything that's Spotify,

49:29.440 --> 49:36.640
Netflix, Instagram, WhatsApp, Signal, and so on do. Everything in one app plus

49:38.080 --> 49:44.240
free payments. You don't have that now here. You need to download the application of Lloyds Bank,

49:44.240 --> 49:49.760
of Barclays Bank, of Bank of America, and so on. They charge you an arm and a leg to make payments

49:49.760 --> 49:58.320
or they charge proprietors, shops, shopkeepers, an arm and a leg, Apple Pay. They charge huge rents

49:59.040 --> 50:05.920
for making these transactions. WeChat, free payments and you can have any WeChat app.

50:06.560 --> 50:16.080
All you need is a bank account somewhere in China, in one. So suddenly, this amazing deal

50:16.800 --> 50:23.120
that the United States had with China, but also with the European Union, a little aside,

50:23.680 --> 50:28.560
when the euro came out, everybody was saying, oh, this is great because we Europeans will be able

50:28.560 --> 50:33.120
to compete with the dollar, the exorbitant privilege of the dollar, the supremacy of the dollar is

50:33.120 --> 50:37.120
going to be challenged by the euro. That never happened and never will happen. Why? Because

50:37.120 --> 50:42.560
if you're a German industrialist, if you, you know, Mercedes Benz or a Dutch industrialist,

50:43.200 --> 50:50.320
you don't want the euro to usurp the power of the dollar because your money, most of your

50:50.320 --> 50:56.640
profits come from selling to the Americans. Now the Americans are a deficit country. The only

50:56.640 --> 51:02.320
reason why you sell to them is because they have the state deficit, which they cover with dollars,

51:02.880 --> 51:08.240
and the only reason why you accept dollars is because of the exorbitant privilege of the dollar.

51:08.240 --> 51:13.520
So you don't want the euro to undermine the power of the dollar as a European capitalist.

51:14.800 --> 51:20.320
The greatest strength of the American dollar is foreign capitalists, not the CIA, not the American

51:20.320 --> 51:26.880
military, not Biden, none of these people. It is a foreign capitalist who freaks out at the thought

51:27.440 --> 51:33.440
that the dollar will lose its authority and power. That applies to the Chinese

51:33.440 --> 51:38.880
capitalists who do not want to see the one, the Chinese currency, overtake the American one.

51:39.760 --> 51:46.320
But the Chinese, because they have, due to the power of the Chinese Communist Party,

51:46.320 --> 51:50.480
fused their big tech with their big banks, something that's not happening in the United States,

51:50.480 --> 51:54.880
Wall Street will never allow Silicon Valley to go anywhere near the payment system.

51:55.600 --> 52:03.440
So they are at loggerheads, Big Tech and Silicon Valley, sorry, Silicon Valley and Wall Street.

52:03.440 --> 52:09.040
In China, they refuse the one thing. That's why you have a WeChat. Add to that the central bank

52:09.040 --> 52:14.880
digital currency, which allows you and me, the foreigners as well, to have a digital wallet

52:14.880 --> 52:23.120
in China with three transactions, in one, of course. Suddenly, the predominance of the dollar

52:23.920 --> 52:30.480
comes into question. The Trump administration started the Cold War by freezing Huawei out.

52:30.480 --> 52:35.680
In my estimation, it's because of that. Nothing to do with Huawei posing a national security

52:35.680 --> 52:40.960
threat or anything like that. And then you have the war in Ukraine. And the confiscation of $400

52:40.960 --> 52:49.680
billion, owned by the Russian Central Bank, by the West, primarily the United States.

52:49.680 --> 52:53.280
I'm not going to start a conversation about whether they should have done that or not.

52:53.280 --> 52:58.480
All I'm saying is that if you are a Saudi Arabian prince, an Indonesian oligarch,

52:59.440 --> 53:03.120
and of course a Russian, but even a Ukrainian oligarch, you never know what happens after the war.

53:03.840 --> 53:10.960
And you see that these Americans have no qualms confiscating your money, hundreds of billions

53:10.960 --> 53:18.000
of dollars. Then you think twice before you put all your money in dollars. So this superhighway

53:18.000 --> 53:21.600
of payments, of free payments that the Chinese have created, which they didn't even want to use

53:21.600 --> 53:26.080
themselves because they want the American dollar because their capitalist profits come from the

53:26.080 --> 53:34.000
American. Suddenly, it sees a lot of traffic. And Wall Street, they are shitting their pants.

53:34.000 --> 53:39.760
Excuse my French. It's welcome because they think, oh my God, here we have an alternative to the

53:39.760 --> 53:47.760
dollar system. I think this is what's underpinning the New Cold War. When Biden announced that

53:47.760 --> 53:55.200
essentially what he told the Chinese in the fall of 2021 was, we will prevent you from becoming

53:55.200 --> 54:00.560
in a technological advanced country. When you ban the sale of advanced chips, chips to a country

54:00.560 --> 54:07.280
like China, you're saying you will stay technologically backwards. Well, that's a declaration of war.

54:07.600 --> 54:15.600
A technological war, but economic war. So they start decoupling themselves and they start

54:16.160 --> 54:23.920
putting more emphasis on this alternative payment system. So it's a clash of two cloud fiefs,

54:24.560 --> 54:31.840
two cloud techno feudalisms, a clash between two payment systems, both of them digital,

54:31.840 --> 54:37.360
both of them living on the cloud. One dollar denominated, the other one denominated. And where

54:37.360 --> 54:43.680
is Britain? Where is the European Union? Nowhere. We are utterly insignificant.

54:45.600 --> 54:50.080
It's a reassuring place to be, isn't it? So I don't mind being insignificant. It's just that,

54:50.080 --> 54:55.520
you know, our politicians have not gotten onto that. What's actually happening? Yeah, they keep

54:55.600 --> 55:02.160
thinking up and making Britain great again, the European Union that is going to become a

55:02.160 --> 55:09.600
significant force if we integrate more and we have more countries in the Balkans and Ukraine and so

55:09.600 --> 55:18.320
rubbish. We are nobodies. It is China on the one hand with the coalescence of the bricks around it

55:18.880 --> 55:24.000
and the United States on the other hand. That's a very unstable world to live in and doesn't

55:24.000 --> 55:28.800
augur very well for the European continent, including Britain. Could you talk a little bit about

55:29.680 --> 55:36.000
how cryptocurrency fits into that network? Because I assume on the one hand this possibly

55:36.000 --> 55:42.400
democratised, direct, discreet system for financial transactions essentially threatens

55:42.400 --> 55:45.120
the stability and the supremacy of those two payment systems you just mentioned, though.

55:46.080 --> 55:54.640
I think that crypto is overblown. It's macroeconomically and sociologically insignificant.

55:55.440 --> 56:00.480
It is technically fascinating when the algorithm for Bitcoin came out

56:02.800 --> 56:07.920
by Nakamoto or somebody called Nakamoto in 2008. I spent quite a few months studying it.

56:08.880 --> 56:14.240
I was fascinated by the technology and why the magazine interviewed me back then.

56:14.240 --> 56:18.080
What did I think of it? And I said it's a fantastic solution to a problem we have not discovered yet.

56:18.880 --> 56:23.120
It's not money and it can never be money. And I explained in the book why it can never be money.

56:24.160 --> 56:28.320
It can be a speculative asset, which is what it is. I mean nobody uses Bitcoin to buy stuff.

56:29.520 --> 56:35.920
And it would be crazy to use it to buy stuff if you think about it because imagine that I mean

56:35.920 --> 56:40.880
to begin with Bitcoin has a fixed supply. It has to have a fixed supply in order to have value.

56:41.840 --> 56:45.520
But at the moment, lots of people use it to buy things.

56:46.960 --> 56:53.360
And more people come in, demand for Bitcoin increases. So its dollar value or pound value rises.

56:53.360 --> 56:58.400
At some point, when it exceeds a certain point, if it starts working as a function, as a currency,

56:58.960 --> 57:03.360
then people are better off using pounds again and keeping holding their Bitcoin.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.480
So there is a plateau. There is an inbuilt

57:08.000 --> 57:14.400
ceiling, which does not prevent Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency from functioning

57:14.400 --> 57:19.680
like a means of exchange. So then it becomes a speculative thing. And then you have an oligarchy

57:19.680 --> 57:28.720
of those early adopters who are sitting on very valuable piles, stashes of Bitcoins.

57:28.720 --> 57:35.920
So I don't find it interesting. I find the blockchain technology very interesting.

57:35.920 --> 57:42.160
And in my previous book, Another Now, which was a political science fiction novel,

57:43.200 --> 57:49.840
where I imagine Another Now, how could things have developed today in a socialist world

57:49.840 --> 57:57.040
after 2008? How would things work? Blockchain is part of the deal. But it is not a way out

57:57.040 --> 58:02.640
of capitalism or techno-fidelism. It is a technology that we will use once we are free

58:03.200 --> 58:09.680
of the yoke of capital. You addressed the book to your father, who hoped that a capitalist order

58:09.680 --> 58:15.840
would be replaced by a socialist utopia for the benefit of society. And one of the striking

58:15.840 --> 58:19.520
things, well, I wanted to ask you, I was about to ask you, you're almost interviewing yourself,

58:20.480 --> 58:24.480
about Another Now, because obviously it was one of the things in socialism, right?

58:24.560 --> 58:28.320
There are very few blueprints out there about what the future society could look like, and that is

58:28.320 --> 58:33.360
provided in Another Now. You have described it, you have just literally described it as science

58:33.360 --> 58:39.440
fiction. So I don't know how valid it is as a comparison to techno-fidelism and as an alternative.

58:40.000 --> 58:47.520
But you mentioned democratised company and democratised money. And I wonder if you do

58:47.520 --> 58:51.600
think those are viable alternatives to the reality that you're describing in this book.

58:52.160 --> 58:58.480
They are the only viable models, because What We Have Now is not viable. It's real,

58:59.360 --> 59:04.960
but it's not sustainable. The economic crisis we are facing, and which we will continue to face,

59:04.960 --> 59:10.960
have to do with the fact that value is created in a tiny sector of the economy, which is shrinking,

59:11.840 --> 59:16.400
the capitalist sector of the economy. That's where value is produced by wage labor, but that is

59:16.480 --> 59:25.360
shrinking. We have an increasing domain of free labor, of cloud service, of cloud capital,

59:26.080 --> 59:33.440
of the platforms, which are parasitic to a shrinking capitalist base. So our crisis,

59:33.440 --> 59:37.680
financial crisis, economic crisis, cost of living crisis are going to be getting worse and worse

59:37.680 --> 59:44.480
and worse, just like the climate crisis. So this is not a viable system. It's a system we live in,

59:45.040 --> 59:51.120
but we are stampeding towards oblivion, both socially and environmentally.

59:52.480 --> 59:58.000
So the reason why I wrote Another Now, by the way, science fiction is not about any fairy

59:58.000 --> 01:00:03.360
stuff. Science fiction is not about the future. Science fiction is an innovative way of writing

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:09.040
about the past and the present. That's why I always loved science fiction. So as a socialist

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:15.440
and a politician, I always have to answer the guy in the pub or the last in the pub who says to me,

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:20.080
okay, mate, if you don't like the way things are, how should they be? And that's a difficult question,

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:23.920
and I didn't have an answer to that. That's why I sat down and I wrote that novel, which was about,

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:30.880
you know, if our revolution occupied Wall Street and so on had succeeded in 2008, what could life

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:37.680
be like now, given the technologies we have and, you know, the fallen nature of humanity

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:46.720
that is a given, right? We are imperfect beings. So I tried to imagine what would corporate law

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:54.960
be like. So I advocate the idea of one worker, one employee, one share, one vote,

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.600
which if you think about it, it's such an easy idea in the same way you have one vote

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.440
when you go to the polling stations, you have one vote as a worker, and you cannot buy votes,

01:01:05.440 --> 01:01:10.400
you cannot lease votes, you cannot rent them, in the same way you can't in the political system.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:17.120
So imagine that. Suddenly, without revolution, without having, you know, without storming

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:23.520
Backingham Palace or the Winter Palace or whatever, suddenly you have totally democratized

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.840
the world of work, and you have done away with the stock exchanges because if you can't sell and

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.800
buy shares, then it was a point of the stock exchange. And if you have the central bank,

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.480
the Bank of England, let's say, or the European Central Bank, giving each one of us

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:45.280
a free digital wallet with a pin number where we can park our money, then what's the point

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.280
of having an account with Lloyds? Barclays. You don't even need to be authoritarian and

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:58.160
ban them. They will just shrivel and die, unless they can provide you with services

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.600
that they are not providing you now. I mean, the only reason why you now have an account

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:10.480
with a private banker is because it's the only way of using your money. So another now was all

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:16.560
about being practical in a science fiction type of way in answering the question, how could things

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:26.000
be functioning today? Do you think we can get that? Well, I don't think I'm going to live to see it,

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.440
if that's what you're asking. Mind you, I'm getting old anyway, so that doesn't matter.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:38.480
So this is the bad news. The bad news is that I'm not optimistic. But I think that to be optimistic

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.920
today, you have to be a real fool given that there's no empirical evidence pointing to good

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:50.800
outcomes. But then again, imagine this being the 1770s. And I mentioned the 1770s because that was

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.200
the time when Adam Smith was writing his Wealth of Nations, which spearheaded, spearheaded, introduced

01:02:57.200 --> 01:03:02.480
the world to the great transformation of the time from feudalism to capitalism. If I'm right that

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:07.280
today we're living in the same moment of transformation from capitalism to taking feudalism,

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:13.280
I think the 1770s is a good point in time to compare ourselves with. So imagine this was the

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:19.920
1770s and I was advocating a world without slavery. And you were interviewing me and you said,

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:25.680
do you think this is going to happen? I probably would say to you, no. I can't imagine, you know,

01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:33.440
there had been no human society without slavery beforehand. So how could the human mind in the

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:39.920
1770s imagine a world where slavery was universally condemned and bound? So on the one hand,

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:45.440
totally pessimistic. On the other hand, absolutely hopeful. Good.

01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.040
Mr. Farkees, thank you so much for coming in. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.
