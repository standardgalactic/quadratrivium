00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
The neoliberal shift wasn't actually about shrinking the state.

00:02.240 --> 00:05.720
What it was about was about crushing collective power.

00:05.720 --> 00:07.440
The physical assertion of the power of the state,

00:07.440 --> 00:09.200
that was the literal beating up of miners,

00:09.200 --> 00:12.000
the use of the police to put them in their place.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.080
But there was this ideological shift as well,

00:14.080 --> 00:18.000
which was you are not a worker, you are not a citizen,

00:18.000 --> 00:19.360
you are a consumer.

00:19.360 --> 00:22.920
This toxic individualism that has become so pervasive

00:22.920 --> 00:27.640
within our society has allowed our political class

00:27.640 --> 00:29.080
to basically get away with murder.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.760
We need to be presenting the idea of socialism,

00:32.760 --> 00:34.960
not as a project of protection,

00:34.960 --> 00:36.960
but as a project of collective empowerment.

00:36.960 --> 00:37.920
Grace Blakely, hello.

00:37.920 --> 00:38.920
Hi. How's it going?

00:38.920 --> 00:39.920
Good thanks, how are you?

00:39.920 --> 00:41.760
Very well. Very glad to have you here in the Polish Institute.

00:41.760 --> 00:42.880
Lovely to be here.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.560
Yes, great to have you here.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.240
We're talking because of this weighty tone,

00:47.240 --> 00:49.880
vulture capitalism, corporate crimes,

00:49.880 --> 00:52.720
backdoor bailouts and the death of freedom,

00:52.720 --> 00:54.880
a lot of substance which we're going to get into.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.200
I'm glad you think so.

00:56.200 --> 00:56.960
Did you enjoy it?

00:56.960 --> 00:57.800
I did. Good.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.880
But first, for those who don't know who you are,

01:00.880 --> 01:02.680
how would you like to introduce yourself?

01:02.680 --> 01:03.920
So I'm Grace Blakely.

01:03.920 --> 01:05.680
I am a writer.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.880
I write about political economy.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.400
This is my latest book.

01:09.400 --> 01:13.160
I've also got a very well and all good bookstores.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.480
I'm also a staff writer for Tribune Magazine.

01:16.480 --> 01:20.720
And I do bits and pieces in the media.

01:20.720 --> 01:21.840
Nice. Okay.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.440
In that subheading there, Death of Freedom,

01:23.440 --> 01:25.160
I think that's the bit that stands out to me most

01:25.160 --> 01:26.880
and is sort of recurrent throughout, right,

01:26.880 --> 01:31.120
this loss of freedom or a lack of it under capitalism.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.440
So can you start us off there?

01:33.440 --> 01:36.360
Why is it that we're not free in our capitalist system?

01:36.360 --> 01:37.880
I'm really glad that that kind of came through

01:37.880 --> 01:39.040
as the central message of the book

01:39.040 --> 01:41.560
because that is really where I wanted to start.

01:41.560 --> 01:45.200
I think we are fed this line that we live

01:45.200 --> 01:47.760
in this free market democratic system, right?

01:47.760 --> 01:49.000
And that that's what capitalism is.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.520
Capitalism means free markets and democracy.

01:52.520 --> 01:57.520
And the kind of incursion of the state into the economy

01:58.160 --> 02:01.240
limits freedom and creates this problem of big government.

02:01.240 --> 02:04.720
And that results in this kind of dichotomized politics

02:04.720 --> 02:05.560
that we have at the moment,

02:05.560 --> 02:06.680
where it's basically just a debate

02:06.680 --> 02:09.880
between some people saying, we need more market,

02:09.880 --> 02:11.120
less government and other people saying,

02:11.120 --> 02:14.240
we need like more government, less market.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.920
And I just think that that kind of divide

02:17.920 --> 02:21.640
is so just sterile and unhelpful.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.080
And this really came through, I think,

02:23.080 --> 02:25.040
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

02:25.040 --> 02:26.320
So I started writing this book,

02:26.320 --> 02:29.040
which just come out of the 2019 election defeat

02:29.040 --> 02:33.720
and went straight into everything

02:33.720 --> 02:35.560
that was going on around COVID.

02:35.560 --> 02:39.720
And I started being asked like on mainstream TV questions

02:39.720 --> 02:42.400
like, oh, well, the government's spending loads of money.

02:42.400 --> 02:43.560
This is basically Corbanism.

02:43.560 --> 02:44.480
This is what you wanted.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.200
You've got what you campaigned for.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.680
And I started to realize that people had,

02:48.680 --> 02:49.920
there was just this amazing,

02:49.920 --> 02:51.840
astonishing misunderstanding

02:51.840 --> 02:53.200
as to what capitalism actually is

02:53.200 --> 02:54.280
and what socialism is.

02:54.280 --> 02:58.400
People thought that capitalism meant free markets

02:58.400 --> 02:59.560
and the state not doing anything,

02:59.560 --> 03:02.680
despite the fact that actually existing capitalism everywhere

03:02.680 --> 03:05.160
has a very, very active role for the state.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.000
That spending that was taking place during COVID,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.240
it was basically the government funneling money

03:09.240 --> 03:11.720
into massive corporations to landlords

03:11.720 --> 03:13.520
into the financial system.

03:13.520 --> 03:16.600
And somehow we're led to believe that that is socialism,

03:16.600 --> 03:19.440
that the government propping up big business is socialism.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.120
So I kind of wanted to cut through that divide

03:22.120 --> 03:25.120
and say like, you know, this state versus market thing,

03:25.120 --> 03:26.080
it doesn't really work.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.280
It rests on this distinction between politics and economics.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.440
It doesn't really stand up in practice.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.760
You know, most of the time the state is acting

03:33.760 --> 03:35.600
to defend the interests of big business

03:35.600 --> 03:37.640
and big businesses working within the state

03:37.640 --> 03:41.040
and alongside the state to do what it wants to do.

03:41.040 --> 03:44.200
So how can we understand what like a kind of progressive

03:44.200 --> 03:47.720
liberatory politics actually means in that context?

03:47.720 --> 03:52.160
And for me, this always comes back to the dirty word, Marxism.

03:52.160 --> 03:55.120
I think, you know, there's so much misunderstanding

03:55.120 --> 03:57.080
as to what that means as well.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.920
And I kind of start the book by looking at these two quotes.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.280
One is from Marx, which is about him saying, you know,

04:03.280 --> 04:07.600
the worker is treated as a kind of a bee under capitalism

04:07.600 --> 04:08.760
where they just kind of follow orders

04:08.760 --> 04:11.080
and kind of buzz around the hive.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.640
Whereas actually they're architects.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.440
They learn to kind of create,

04:14.440 --> 04:17.120
they kind of yearn to create worlds in their head

04:17.320 --> 04:19.360
and bring those into being with their hands.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.000
And I contrast that with the kind of the quote from this free market,

04:23.000 --> 04:24.960
the kind of darling of the neoliberals, Hayek,

04:24.960 --> 04:26.440
who basically says, freedom of thought

04:26.440 --> 04:28.640
is only of relevance to a small minority.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.160
And it's him and actually even Keynes

04:31.160 --> 04:35.000
and most of the big thinkers that we hold up in our political debate,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.760
they basically all believe,

04:36.760 --> 04:38.720
whether they're on the center left or the center right,

04:38.720 --> 04:40.920
that the vast majority of people

04:40.920 --> 04:43.600
should not be given the power to govern themselves

04:43.600 --> 04:45.720
because they're too stupid or they're too impulsive

04:46.120 --> 04:48.800
or they don't understand the stakes of the decisions that they're making.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.760
Whereas for me, the fundamental insight of Marxism

04:51.760 --> 04:54.480
is that the only way we get to liberation,

04:54.480 --> 04:57.560
the only way we get to a fair and just society

04:57.560 --> 04:59.400
is when people take power,

04:59.400 --> 05:02.320
when they take power within their workplaces and their communities

05:02.320 --> 05:03.840
over political life as a whole,

05:03.840 --> 05:06.440
because politicians aren't going to listen to you if you don't demand it.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.440
You know, corporations certainly aren't going to behave themselves

05:08.440 --> 05:10.080
if you don't like force them to.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.120
It's really up to us to actually begin to kind of build the society

05:13.120 --> 05:15.120
that we want from the ground up.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.480
A risk of asking an absurdly broad question,

05:18.480 --> 05:21.760
but seeing as you just said it there about this kind of mischaracterization

05:21.760 --> 05:23.880
of what Marxism means,

05:23.880 --> 05:25.880
what does Marxism mean to you?

05:25.880 --> 05:27.080
I know you spoke about it a little bit there,

05:27.080 --> 05:31.720
but maybe could you try and put some truth to that sort of ism,

05:31.720 --> 05:35.600
if you like, that style of thought, that method of political analysis?

05:35.600 --> 05:36.520
Yeah, totally.

05:36.520 --> 05:40.120
So as a kind of way of understanding capitalism,

05:40.120 --> 05:42.800
it's, as you say, a kind of mode of analysis

05:42.800 --> 05:46.960
that begins by looking at the way that we produce things as a society.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.400
So rather than say, looking at the prevailing ideas within a society

05:51.400 --> 05:54.640
and saying history is driven forward by these great battles

05:54.640 --> 05:59.680
between different groups of ideologies or different sets of ideas,

05:59.680 --> 06:03.240
Marxism says most of what happens within our society

06:03.240 --> 06:06.720
is shaped by the conditions in which things are produced.

06:06.720 --> 06:10.440
And the insight about capitalism is a social system

06:10.480 --> 06:13.920
that rests upon the fact that some people own all the things

06:13.920 --> 06:15.400
that we need to produce things,

06:15.400 --> 06:18.000
and there's this big class of people who cannot survive

06:18.000 --> 06:20.400
other than by selling their labour power for a living.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.960
So just as an example, you know, there's a difference between capitalism,

06:23.960 --> 06:26.480
this social system based on the production of commodities,

06:26.480 --> 06:28.720
class-based system based on the production of commodities,

06:28.720 --> 06:31.200
and feudalism, which is the system that revolves around land,

06:31.200 --> 06:33.400
where you have an aristocracy that's in charge.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.280
And again, this is about how things are produced,

06:35.280 --> 06:37.360
like the political dynamics of feudalism come back

06:37.360 --> 06:39.880
to the fact that a small class owns all the land

06:39.880 --> 06:43.160
and the peasants have to work it to get what they need to subsist.

06:43.160 --> 06:47.080
In the same way, the insight of Marxism is that it's this class-divided society

06:47.080 --> 06:49.120
oriented around the production of commodities,

06:49.120 --> 06:51.040
which is sold for profit,

06:51.040 --> 06:54.000
and that that is undertaken through this class division,

06:54.000 --> 06:55.480
this social division of labour,

06:55.480 --> 06:57.760
where basically working people,

06:57.760 --> 06:59.600
the people who are forced to sell their labour power,

06:59.600 --> 07:01.680
are exploited by the ones who own things,

07:01.680 --> 07:04.000
because they own the stuff that everyone else needs

07:04.000 --> 07:06.040
just to be able to live.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.480
And it's from that that you then begin to understand

07:09.480 --> 07:12.120
the dynamics that I highlight in the book.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.800
Because, you know, the other way of looking at capitalism

07:14.800 --> 07:16.880
is, as I've said, that it's a system based on, you know,

07:16.880 --> 07:20.040
private property and free markets, basically.

07:20.040 --> 07:23.320
And then you have these ideas that only human freedom

07:23.320 --> 07:24.880
can be protected by free markets,

07:24.880 --> 07:28.080
and free markets are the only systems that lead to kind of democracy

07:28.080 --> 07:30.240
and respect for human rights and all those different sorts of things.

07:30.240 --> 07:33.280
That's the kind of lie that we're told about the way capitalism works.

07:33.320 --> 07:36.360
But if you start from this perspective of seeing capitalism

07:36.360 --> 07:40.240
as this system that's basically on class domination,

07:40.240 --> 07:42.560
then things start to make a little bit more sense,

07:42.560 --> 07:45.120
because we don't actually have free markets.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.880
You know, there's lots of examples in this book

07:46.880 --> 07:51.120
where I show that most of the major industries

07:51.120 --> 07:53.600
within the world's economy are dominated by one or two firms

07:53.600 --> 07:58.360
that are deeply corrupt and, like, in the pockets of politicians

07:58.360 --> 07:59.440
and vice versa.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.040
So I start with the example of Boeing, right,

08:01.080 --> 08:05.160
which has been in the news recently for the doors blowing off its planes

08:05.160 --> 08:07.200
at, you know, about 13,000 feet in the air.

08:07.200 --> 08:12.920
This comes on the back of these crashes that took place several years ago now,

08:12.920 --> 08:15.760
where over 350 people died in two separate crashes

08:15.760 --> 08:18.640
where Boeing planes just nose-dived out of the air.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.440
I won't give you all the gory details,

08:20.440 --> 08:25.320
but suffice to say, people are Boeing knew about the flaws in this plane

08:25.320 --> 08:27.880
before it was put on the market.

08:27.920 --> 08:30.800
They deleted references to the system

08:30.800 --> 08:32.600
that caused the problem in the pilot manual.

08:32.600 --> 08:35.200
They didn't tell anyone what was going on.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.720
These concerns weren't raised when the planes did crash.

08:38.720 --> 08:40.440
They tried to blame the pilots.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.960
The FAA, the regulator, basically did nothing.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.360
And throughout all of this, the American state

08:46.360 --> 08:50.000
was channeling billions of dollars' worth of tax cuts

08:50.000 --> 08:53.560
and subsidies into Boeing.

08:53.560 --> 08:57.160
And I think what that shows is that this argument that, you know,

08:57.160 --> 08:59.040
let's say this problem with Boeing, right,

08:59.040 --> 09:00.600
it shows that the market doesn't work

09:00.600 --> 09:02.440
and we need to hand more power to the government.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.760
Well, actually, the government was just as involved with this

09:04.760 --> 09:07.640
as the executives at Boeing.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.640
And it's because capitalism is this system

09:09.640 --> 09:11.960
where everything is oriented around making sure

09:11.960 --> 09:15.200
that the people who are in control of the production process

09:15.200 --> 09:17.440
basically get what they want, right?

09:17.440 --> 09:20.080
And so the only way to push back against that

09:20.080 --> 09:21.920
isn't to say, let's give more power to politicians,

09:21.920 --> 09:24.360
because, you know, half the time they're in the pockets of these guys,

09:24.360 --> 09:28.360
is actually to say, how do we pull power down?

09:28.360 --> 09:29.800
So how could workers within Boeing

09:29.800 --> 09:33.680
have organized to resist both their exploitation

09:33.680 --> 09:35.360
and the kind of corruption of this company?

09:35.360 --> 09:37.080
And there's another example in the book

09:37.080 --> 09:40.920
I look out of the Lucas Plan, where workers in an aerospace

09:40.920 --> 09:43.000
company in the UK did just that.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.760
They kind of organized to try and take control of the firm.

09:45.760 --> 09:49.360
The audio recordings between the pilots union and Boeing

09:49.360 --> 09:51.280
are extraordinary to listen to.

09:51.280 --> 09:53.640
Yes.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.920
OK, I was going to ask you about planned economies, which

09:55.920 --> 09:57.360
are typically associated with communism.

09:57.360 --> 09:58.800
But seeing as you mentioned feudalism,

09:58.800 --> 10:01.120
I just want to at risk of taking this on a tangent already,

10:01.120 --> 10:02.160
but why not?

10:02.160 --> 10:04.200
We had Janice Verifakis in here a couple of months ago

10:04.200 --> 10:05.800
talking about techno feudalism, right?

10:05.800 --> 10:09.760
And this idea that actually we're past capitalism now,

10:09.760 --> 10:12.720
and what our modern economic model actually far more closely

10:12.720 --> 10:15.440
resembles feudalism than a lot of people would like to believe,

10:15.440 --> 10:18.960
that these sort of cloud capital, these huge companies,

10:18.960 --> 10:20.800
these huge corporations are actually, in a way,

10:20.800 --> 10:22.280
modern feudal lords.

10:22.280 --> 10:23.520
What do you make of that argument?

10:23.520 --> 10:25.080
I don't know if you read the book and I appreciate it.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.240
Yeah, I have.

10:26.240 --> 10:27.000
I really like Janice.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.240
I interviewed him for his book launch, actually,

10:29.240 --> 10:30.760
a couple of months ago.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.760
And I agree with a lot of his analysis,

10:32.760 --> 10:35.720
but I think we come at it from different perspectives.

10:35.720 --> 10:37.960
Because whilst a lot of the stuff that he writes about

10:37.960 --> 10:40.080
in terms of the detail and the analysis as to what's

10:40.080 --> 10:43.000
happening with the economy, I totally agree with.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.520
I just think that that is part of capitalism.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.960
And you see a lot of this stuff in progressive economics,

10:51.000 --> 10:54.240
where you get critiques of the way that the economy works

10:54.240 --> 10:57.240
from people who say, well, this isn't real capitalism.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.320
They say, for example, the dominance of finance

11:00.320 --> 11:04.080
means actually that you've got these monopolistic banks

11:04.080 --> 11:05.680
sucking rents out of the economy,

11:05.680 --> 11:09.320
as though they are the modern examples of feudal lords.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.040
Or you've got too much concentrated corporate power.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.840
That means we don't have free markets, so it's not capitalism.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.280
And again, I come back to this point

11:16.280 --> 11:18.800
that capitalism does not mean free markets.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.680
Those two things are not the same.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.160
Markets are an important part of the way

11:23.160 --> 11:24.480
that capitalism functions.

11:24.480 --> 11:26.800
They're a very important ideological part

11:26.800 --> 11:28.040
of the way capitalism functions.

11:28.040 --> 11:30.240
You have to believe that you're competing

11:30.240 --> 11:34.080
against other people in this market for your labor.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.000
Otherwise, the system loses legitimacy.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.280
But the actual functioning of production

11:38.280 --> 11:40.840
in the capitalist system centers far more

11:40.840 --> 11:43.360
on stuff that happens within massive monopolistic

11:43.360 --> 11:46.680
corporations than it does on the interactions that

11:46.680 --> 11:47.920
take place in the market.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.800
And this isn't a new thing.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.280
In the book I go back to just like the example

11:52.280 --> 11:54.960
of the East India Company, where

11:54.960 --> 11:56.800
this was like this massive joint venture

11:56.800 --> 12:00.480
between some wealthy and powerful people who

12:00.480 --> 12:03.600
gained the right to create this big corporate entity

12:03.600 --> 12:07.280
and the British state in pursuit of imperial power.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.080
And that's another part of the book, which is that this nexus

12:10.080 --> 12:12.720
of power that we see at the level of the domestic economy,

12:12.720 --> 12:15.400
the kind of fusion of state and corporate power,

12:15.400 --> 12:18.120
is often projected over the whole world economy

12:18.120 --> 12:20.160
in the form of imperial power.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.080
And yeah, this was a big part of the development

12:22.080 --> 12:24.720
of British capitalism, the East India Company.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.560
Adam Smith called it a strange absurdity.

12:27.560 --> 12:30.360
He said it was a state in the disguise of a merchant.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.760
And all the kind of original theorists of capitalism

12:32.760 --> 12:34.280
were like, this doesn't really make sense.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.880
This doesn't fit within the way that we think about capitalism.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.320
But it was companies like the East India Company

12:39.320 --> 12:42.480
and the AIC itself were central to the development

12:42.480 --> 12:45.240
of the capitalist system across the world.

12:45.240 --> 12:47.560
So there isn't this clean distinction

12:47.560 --> 12:55.160
between corporate power and kind of free market capitalism.

12:55.160 --> 12:56.480
Those two things go hand in hand.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.480
The Anarchy by William Dalrymple is a really interesting study

12:59.480 --> 13:00.480
on the East India Company.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.000
He's great.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.520
I've forgotten the name of it now,

13:03.520 --> 13:05.160
but there's a method of system analysis,

13:05.160 --> 13:06.640
which basically says if you want to understand

13:06.640 --> 13:09.320
the intention of a system, you don't look at how it was designed.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.280
You just look at the outcomes.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.400
And so if you look at capitalism and you say,

13:13.400 --> 13:17.320
well, modern capitalism is defined by financialization,

13:17.320 --> 13:19.120
by the extraction of economic rent,

13:19.120 --> 13:20.360
then it actually doesn't particularly matter

13:20.360 --> 13:21.200
if that was never the intention.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.200
If that's what it is now,

13:22.200 --> 13:25.800
then actually that's one of the defining characteristics of it.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.440
Yeah, no, completely.

13:27.440 --> 13:31.320
And I think you can start by looking at the outcomes,

13:31.320 --> 13:33.320
of course, and that is important.

13:33.320 --> 13:37.120
And saying that capitalism kind of isn't working

13:37.120 --> 13:38.960
in the way it's supposed to.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.920
It kind of harkens back to people who are like,

13:40.920 --> 13:45.360
oh, well, the like state socialism practice in the USSR

13:45.360 --> 13:47.720
isn't real state socialism.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.760
And yeah, I mean, I think that that was state socialism

13:50.760 --> 13:52.400
and it's different to democratic socialism,

13:52.400 --> 13:53.880
which is what I'm arguing for.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.680
But it's kind of a bit of a,

13:55.680 --> 13:57.520
it's kind of a non-argument, isn't it really?

13:57.520 --> 14:00.160
It's like capitalism could be this nice, lovely,

14:00.160 --> 14:02.000
fluffy, wonderful thing,

14:02.000 --> 14:03.160
but it's just not working

14:03.160 --> 14:05.840
because it's being kind of corrupted by people at the top.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.560
And often this actually veers into like

14:08.560 --> 14:10.200
anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, right?

14:10.200 --> 14:13.760
Because people say, oh, capitalism is this lovely system,

14:13.760 --> 14:16.240
but it's being corrupted by kind of evil financiers

14:16.240 --> 14:20.080
or, you know, weird kind of lizard people or whatever.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.600
I'm not up to date with all the latest conspiracy theories.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.320
Not up to date, not up to date.

14:24.320 --> 14:26.080
I think that one's still floating around.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.840
There's some great YouTube videos

14:27.840 --> 14:29.360
where like there's like a glitch or something

14:29.360 --> 14:31.920
of like a royal and people like that was him shaped.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.520
He's just taken from his lizard form into the human world.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.120
I'm glad you mentioned the USSR, right?

14:37.120 --> 14:39.080
Because you would typically associate planned economies

14:39.120 --> 14:41.400
with those communist authoritarian states.

14:41.400 --> 14:42.640
But you argue in the book, right,

14:42.640 --> 14:44.440
that actually capitalist economies

14:44.440 --> 14:46.520
are quite closely resembled right, a planned economy.

14:46.520 --> 14:48.560
So who's doing the planning?

14:48.560 --> 14:49.480
How does it work?

14:49.480 --> 14:50.400
Talk us through it.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.240
That is great.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.360
That was nearly an exact quote from my book

14:53.360 --> 14:55.200
when I say something like,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.240
what's important isn't the presence or absence of planning.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.360
It's who's doing the planning?

14:58.360 --> 15:00.880
How is it being undertaken and in whose interests?

15:00.880 --> 15:03.200
And I think that's really important because, yeah,

15:03.200 --> 15:04.960
so, you know, just for clarity,

15:04.960 --> 15:06.120
I'm not saying that there's no difference

15:06.120 --> 15:08.760
between a state socialist and a capitalist economy.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.920
Obviously there is.

15:10.920 --> 15:13.840
But I suppose what I'm arguing is that there is this scale

15:15.280 --> 15:18.800
along which you can chart most modern economies.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.040
You can place most modern economies on the scale

15:21.040 --> 15:26.040
between kind of pure anarchy and pure centralized control.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.280
But actually the important thing to note

15:28.280 --> 15:31.320
as well is that that scale has maybe at least two axes, right?

15:31.320 --> 15:35.040
One of them concerns state planning and centralized control

15:35.040 --> 15:36.880
and the other one concerns corporate planning

15:36.880 --> 15:38.560
and centralized control.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.560
So you could have, you know,

15:41.560 --> 15:44.360
private corporate planning and state centralized control.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.760
So like the USSR, obviously,

15:45.760 --> 15:48.680
there was like an immense amount of centralized control

15:48.680 --> 15:50.720
by the state over the economy.

15:50.720 --> 15:52.160
Bear in mind that that centralized planning

15:52.160 --> 15:53.840
was never total and it never can be.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.320
You know, you never have a purely planned economy.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.000
You never have a purely anarchic economy.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.320
It's very important to remember

15:59.320 --> 16:01.600
economies are always these kind of complex systems.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.200
They never, and this is kind of again,

16:03.200 --> 16:04.440
an insight from systems theory,

16:04.440 --> 16:06.760
which Hayek, the famous neoliberal economist,

16:06.760 --> 16:07.600
really liked.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.960
The reason that he said that centralized planning

16:09.960 --> 16:13.360
would always kind of create all these unintended consequences

16:13.360 --> 16:16.160
because you can't ever completely control

16:16.160 --> 16:17.680
a system as complex as an economy,

16:17.680 --> 16:19.360
as complex as a society.

16:19.360 --> 16:22.080
At the same time, those systems never collapse

16:22.080 --> 16:23.080
into complete anarchy.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.120
There's always some order.

16:24.120 --> 16:26.400
There's always some stability that emerges

16:26.400 --> 16:27.720
within those systems.

16:27.720 --> 16:30.520
So economies operate in this, on the spectrum

16:30.520 --> 16:35.520
between anarchy and centralized coordination and control.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.240
And you see this today if you look at, for example,

16:40.240 --> 16:42.800
like Chinese state capitalism.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.240
The Chinese economy is a capitalist economy.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.680
It's oriented around the production of commodities

16:47.680 --> 16:51.880
for sale and for profit.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.800
And that is an incredibly centralized economy

16:55.800 --> 16:57.880
where you have both the states

16:57.880 --> 17:00.160
and extremely powerful corporations

17:00.160 --> 17:02.000
that have an immense amount of control

17:02.000 --> 17:03.880
over people's daily lives.

17:03.920 --> 17:08.480
At the same time, the state in the US is also,

17:08.480 --> 17:10.280
in some ways, fairly similar

17:10.280 --> 17:12.840
because you have an immense amount of corporate control

17:12.840 --> 17:14.920
over people's daily lives.

17:14.920 --> 17:17.120
You have some of the largest and most powerful corporations

17:17.120 --> 17:19.440
on the planet that are centered in the US.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.160
They have, a lot of them have kind of

17:21.160 --> 17:23.520
monopolistic control over their markets.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.880
They have what's called kind of monopsony power

17:25.880 --> 17:27.680
in the labor market, which means that they're able

17:27.680 --> 17:30.120
to kind of control the market for labor.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.040
They have immense lobbying power.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.200
They kind of shape what happens within the state

17:35.200 --> 17:38.840
at both the kind of federal level and a more local level.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.440
They have kind of this immense ecological power

17:42.440 --> 17:46.520
to shape the future of our relationship with the climate.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.880
And they have the power to avoid and evade tax,

17:49.880 --> 17:52.880
to promulgate laws, to break the law with impunity.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.080
There's this massive issue of kind of corporate impunity

17:55.080 --> 17:57.520
where you have basically corporations allowed

17:57.520 --> 18:00.280
to break the law without any sanction whatsoever.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.200
And all of this power is exercised, as I said,

18:04.200 --> 18:05.680
with very little accountability

18:05.680 --> 18:10.040
because these institutions have so much power within the state.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.040
So, you know, we like to think of the divide, as I've said,

18:13.040 --> 18:15.920
within our politics as one between kind of, you know,

18:17.120 --> 18:19.640
centrally planned socialist economies on the one hand,

18:19.640 --> 18:20.880
like we had in the USSR,

18:20.880 --> 18:23.600
and then these lovely free market democratic

18:23.600 --> 18:25.080
capitalist economies on the other hand,

18:25.080 --> 18:27.360
and the US is supposed to be an exemplar of that.

18:27.360 --> 18:30.680
But actually, if you take the kind of big superpowers

18:30.680 --> 18:32.280
that we've seen in the world economy

18:32.280 --> 18:33.720
over the last kind of hundred years,

18:33.720 --> 18:35.920
the USSR, the US, and China,

18:35.920 --> 18:40.160
all of them share in common this immense centralisation

18:40.160 --> 18:45.080
of power at the centre among this core of, you know,

18:45.080 --> 18:48.120
state apparatchiks, heads of major companies,

18:48.120 --> 18:50.680
heads of major financial institutions.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.640
And all of them share this problem.

18:52.640 --> 18:56.560
Or, you know, if you're an elite, this positive element,

18:56.560 --> 18:58.360
which is that the vast majority of people

18:58.360 --> 19:03.360
have no real control over what happens in their daily lives.

19:03.360 --> 19:06.080
They feel as though they have no power.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.880
Now, of course, what I argue in the book is that we do have power.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.200
If we are able to organise and resist the power

19:12.200 --> 19:16.880
that has exerted upon society by these institutions,

19:16.880 --> 19:20.480
then we can begin to change things.

19:20.480 --> 19:23.120
But the world in which we live

19:23.120 --> 19:24.520
is one in which we're told,

19:24.560 --> 19:28.320
you, as an isolated individual, have no power up against this system

19:28.320 --> 19:30.680
that is basically kind of all-encompassing.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.560
Even as you're told, oh, you do have the power

19:32.560 --> 19:34.640
to kind of decide what you want to consume

19:34.640 --> 19:36.480
and decide who you want to vote for.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.240
And, you know, you're in this, like, free market system

19:39.240 --> 19:43.160
where you're completely free to make those micro-decisions

19:43.160 --> 19:44.280
on a daily basis.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.080
And yet the whole structure of the society in which you live

19:47.080 --> 19:49.640
has already been decided by someone else.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.200
And as a voter, as a consumer,

19:52.200 --> 19:53.520
you have very little influence

19:53.520 --> 19:55.520
over how those decisions are made.

19:55.520 --> 19:58.720
I really want to drill into that feeling of powerlessness.

19:58.720 --> 20:01.160
I think it's so relevant, you know, that...

20:01.160 --> 20:03.200
call it capitalist realism,

20:03.200 --> 20:04.680
call it a feeling of powerlessness, I don't know,

20:04.680 --> 20:07.400
an omwi and apathy that essentially are an ability

20:07.400 --> 20:08.920
to imagine an alternative.

20:08.920 --> 20:12.200
Even though, as you write and as others have written as well,

20:12.200 --> 20:13.400
there are alternatives.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.400
There are, at risk of sounding like,

20:16.400 --> 20:19.400
slightly sincere at earnest, like joyful alternatives, right,

20:19.400 --> 20:20.880
where people can find self-expression,

20:20.880 --> 20:22.800
self-realisation, self-actualisation.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.560
But it's almost one of the defining characteristics

20:24.560 --> 20:29.400
of the system, right, is its ability to drum out, reduce,

20:29.400 --> 20:32.120
minimalise any idea or possibility of conceiving

20:32.120 --> 20:34.800
of something alternative than what we currently have.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.560
Yeah, and I think this problem actually comes down

20:39.560 --> 20:43.280
to something that's shifted with the transition

20:43.280 --> 20:44.800
towards neoliberalism.

20:44.800 --> 20:47.560
So I argue in the book, right, the neoliberals,

20:47.560 --> 20:50.000
the shift that we had in the 1980s with Thatcher, with Reagan,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.880
this idea that we needed kind of privatisation,

20:51.880 --> 20:54.560
free markets, a shrinking of the state,

20:54.560 --> 20:56.560
none of those, like the shrinking of the state

20:56.560 --> 20:57.960
didn't actually happen.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.280
Those were all kind of ideological justifications

21:00.280 --> 21:03.760
for what was actually just a massive reassertion

21:03.760 --> 21:08.320
of the power of a big business, a finance, et cetera,

21:08.320 --> 21:11.200
and a crushing of the power of working people,

21:11.200 --> 21:13.280
particularly the labour movement.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.800
But you had these narratives that were like,

21:14.800 --> 21:17.080
we need privatisation, we need deregulation,

21:17.080 --> 21:19.160
and that's going to deliver free markets,

21:19.160 --> 21:23.680
and promote personal freedom and autonomy, basically.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.280
In fact, what we've seen is, in many ways,

21:26.280 --> 21:28.760
a kind of expansion of the power of the state,

21:28.760 --> 21:31.200
and an expansion of corporate power alongside that.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.600
Often we see kind of state power wielded

21:33.600 --> 21:34.840
through the private sector as well.

21:34.840 --> 21:37.920
I use some examples in the book, like G4S,

21:37.920 --> 21:42.880
McKinsey, these kind of like quasi-public institutions

21:42.880 --> 21:46.400
that are often charged with just astonishing corruption

21:46.400 --> 21:48.720
or mismanagement or fraud or whatever.

21:48.800 --> 21:50.160
And they just get away with it, sorry?

21:50.160 --> 21:51.160
Macquarie's probably a pretty good example.

21:51.160 --> 21:53.080
Yeah, exactly.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.160
And they just get away with it because they're just so close

21:55.160 --> 21:58.280
to these public institutions.

21:58.280 --> 22:00.720
So the neoliberal shift wasn't actually

22:00.720 --> 22:01.920
about shrinking the state.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.920
What it was about was about crushing collective power.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.520
And you see this with the first moves

22:09.520 --> 22:11.920
that politicians like Bertrand Reagan undertake

22:11.920 --> 22:12.760
when they come into power.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.000
It was crush the labour movement.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.960
And there was a discourse that surrounded this as well.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.040
There was the physical assertion of the power of the state.

22:19.040 --> 22:20.800
That was the literal beating up of miners,

22:20.800 --> 22:23.560
the use of the police to put them in their place.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.640
But there was this ideological shift as well,

22:25.640 --> 22:29.600
which was you are not a worker, you are not a citizen,

22:29.600 --> 22:34.600
you are a consumer, you are an entrepreneur of the self.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.320
And a lot of neoliberal policies were designed to push this.

22:38.320 --> 22:41.280
It was like, we will allow you to buy your own house.

22:41.280 --> 22:43.520
We will privatise your pension.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.520
You will be able to take out loads of debt.

22:45.520 --> 22:48.040
Your life will become this balance sheet

22:48.040 --> 22:51.400
of assets and liabilities and it's up to you to manage that.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.960
If you manage it well, you will do well and you will succeed.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.400
If you manage it badly, you will fail

22:55.400 --> 22:58.160
and that will be entirely your own fault.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.680
And even things like the privatisation of education.

23:01.680 --> 23:05.000
Education becomes an investment in your human capital

23:05.000 --> 23:06.880
and it's up to you to undertake that investment

23:06.880 --> 23:08.520
and to make the best of it.

23:08.520 --> 23:13.520
So you see this ideological decimation

23:14.200 --> 23:15.760
of the collective consciousness

23:15.760 --> 23:19.480
that was really the foundation of the post-war consensus.

23:19.480 --> 23:23.800
And it's replacement with this rampant toxic individualism.

23:23.800 --> 23:25.560
And I actually think that a lot of the problems

23:25.560 --> 23:27.280
that we have in our society today,

23:27.280 --> 23:29.840
whether it's like the crazy stuff that you see

23:29.840 --> 23:33.960
on social media, whether it's this sense of powerlessness,

23:34.760 --> 23:37.200
whether it's even like low pay as a result

23:37.200 --> 23:38.680
of people not being able to organise,

23:38.680 --> 23:42.680
they all come back to this question of individualism.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.640
And you hear this, particularly among young people,

23:45.640 --> 23:48.040
there's a sense that when things go wrong,

23:48.040 --> 23:49.120
it's your own fault.

23:49.120 --> 23:50.840
You have no one to blame but yourself.

23:50.840 --> 23:54.240
And I think this is really like damaging people's mental health.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.000
There's this sense of like deep and profound shame

23:57.000 --> 24:00.360
at not being able to compete in the same way

24:00.360 --> 24:02.320
as maybe those around you.

24:02.320 --> 24:04.600
I think this feeds the rise of the far right.

24:04.600 --> 24:08.440
I think young men who feel that they are unable

24:08.440 --> 24:12.160
to kind of portray the kind of alpha characteristics

24:12.160 --> 24:14.880
that are associated with like elite men,

24:14.880 --> 24:17.000
get this sense of like resentment and anger

24:17.000 --> 24:19.920
that they then kind of take out on the system as a whole.

24:19.920 --> 24:21.520
And this again comes down to this idea

24:21.520 --> 24:23.080
of like competitive individualism.

24:23.080 --> 24:24.800
It is up to you to compete and do well.

24:24.800 --> 24:25.640
And if you can't do that,

24:25.640 --> 24:27.240
then you're a loser and a failure.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.160
And all of this comes back to this shift

24:29.160 --> 24:30.600
that was at the heart of neoliberalism,

24:30.600 --> 24:32.640
which is that there's no such thing as society,

24:32.640 --> 24:33.920
which is what Thatcher said,

24:33.920 --> 24:35.880
it's all just a collection of isolated individuals

24:35.880 --> 24:37.520
competing against each other.

24:37.520 --> 24:39.920
And I mean, to illustrate what this means

24:39.960 --> 24:43.440
for our sense of our own power within the system.

24:43.440 --> 24:46.640
Think about like 50, 60 years ago,

24:46.640 --> 24:49.880
if you as a worker were dissatisfied with your pay,

24:49.880 --> 24:52.680
or you went home and you couldn't put food on the table,

24:52.680 --> 24:54.600
you would have gone into your workplace,

24:54.600 --> 24:55.680
chatted with your coworkers,

24:55.680 --> 24:56.800
chatted with your union rep and said,

24:56.800 --> 24:58.960
look, are you in the same position as me?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.400
Cause I can't afford to feed my kids.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.600
And they would have been like, yeah, you're right.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.520
Okay, well, we need to do something about this.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.800
We need to go and strike and organize

25:04.800 --> 25:06.520
because our boss is exploiting us.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.360
Today, if you can't put food on the table,

25:08.360 --> 25:09.200
what do you do?

25:09.200 --> 25:10.440
You blame yourself.

25:10.440 --> 25:12.320
You maybe go out and get a personal loan,

25:12.320 --> 25:13.760
a very high interest rate.

25:13.760 --> 25:15.120
Some people become depressed

25:15.120 --> 25:16.800
because they're like, I can't afford to feed my family.

25:16.800 --> 25:17.640
I'm a loser.

25:17.640 --> 25:22.640
There's no sense of your, you know, collective power

25:23.280 --> 25:27.360
or indeed the way in which you are being exploited

25:27.360 --> 25:29.120
because of your position within the system.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.240
It's all, it's my fault, right?

25:31.240 --> 25:32.880
Or sometimes it's their fault, right?

25:32.880 --> 25:34.720
It's scroungers or immigrants or whatever.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.160
It's like some problem over there.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.920
And that I think is really what is preventing us

25:39.920 --> 25:42.120
from being able to resist.

25:42.120 --> 25:45.040
Because if people did have this greater sense

25:45.040 --> 25:48.080
of like collective agency, then, you know,

25:48.080 --> 25:49.600
we would have stronger unions.

25:49.600 --> 25:51.240
People would be organizing in their workplaces

25:51.240 --> 25:52.840
to demand higher wages.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.800
We would have tenants unions, right?

25:54.800 --> 25:56.120
People wouldn't be so easy to exploit

25:56.120 --> 25:58.320
within the private rented sector.

25:58.320 --> 26:01.240
And we do have those, but they would be stronger.

26:01.240 --> 26:04.880
People would be pouring out onto the streets saying,

26:04.920 --> 26:07.200
you know, we cannot afford to heat our homes.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.320
This is a failure of our political class.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.120
But instead, it's I'm a failure.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.260
I have to use a food bank, right?

26:14.260 --> 26:16.400
This like toxic individualism

26:16.400 --> 26:19.040
that has become so pervasive within our society

26:20.200 --> 26:22.560
has allowed our political class

26:22.560 --> 26:24.320
to basically get away with murder.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.960
Because instead of blaming them,

26:25.960 --> 26:27.760
we all blame ourselves or we blame each other.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.920
And that is I think the most profound ideological shift

26:29.920 --> 26:31.280
that we've seen under neoliberalism.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.400
I'm so glad you mentioned that

26:32.400 --> 26:33.760
in the context of mental health.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.000
Because I think one of the most damaging instances

26:37.000 --> 26:39.920
of this sort of toxic individualism

26:39.920 --> 26:43.520
and sort of high perseverance of the individual

26:43.520 --> 26:45.240
is in sort of wellness, right?

26:45.240 --> 26:48.840
It's like rather than engaging with a systemic analysis

26:48.840 --> 26:51.880
of like, why do I feel anxious and depressed?

26:51.880 --> 26:53.840
Maybe it's because I don't have secure housing.

26:53.840 --> 26:55.200
Maybe it's because I'm low paid.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.200
Maybe it's because I'm burdened with personal debt.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.720
And instead it's work on yourself, set boundaries.

27:01.160 --> 27:05.280
Do you actually maybe need to cut some people out of your life?

27:05.280 --> 27:07.800
Like, what are you talking about?

27:09.240 --> 27:11.800
Can you talk a little bit more about the role

27:11.800 --> 27:13.760
that financial institutions played

27:13.760 --> 27:15.880
in that sort of expansion of neoliberalism,

27:15.880 --> 27:19.720
particularly in that sort of thatcherite 80s Britain?

27:19.720 --> 27:21.240
Yeah, totally.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.080
Yeah, I think that example of mental health

27:23.080 --> 27:24.400
is really good, right?

27:24.400 --> 27:27.200
And I want to say, you wouldn't see this

27:27.200 --> 27:28.520
when it comes to people's physical health, right?

27:28.520 --> 27:30.560
You wouldn't be like, oh, you know,

27:30.560 --> 27:33.200
it's your fault that you've got lung cancer

27:33.200 --> 27:35.200
because, I don't know, you're not looking after yourself.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.080
You're not taking your daily turmeric or whatever.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.560
But actually you do now see that, right?

27:40.560 --> 27:44.720
It's like instances of illnesses that result

27:44.720 --> 27:47.280
from social issues like air pollution

27:47.280 --> 27:48.880
or not having adequate diet or whatever,

27:48.880 --> 27:51.760
increasingly are being blamed on individual people.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.200
So you're seeing this become more and more pervasive

27:55.200 --> 27:56.880
in every area of society.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.000
And there's obviously an ideological dimension here

28:00.000 --> 28:01.520
as we've just discussed.

28:01.520 --> 28:05.280
But again, coming back to this idea of what is Marxism,

28:05.280 --> 28:09.880
we trace back things that happen in the realm of ideas

28:09.880 --> 28:12.320
to things that happen in the realm of production,

28:12.320 --> 28:16.040
in the economy or in politics or whatever.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.080
We don't just say, oh, suddenly everyone changed their minds

28:18.080 --> 28:20.280
or there was a really powerful ideological movement

28:20.280 --> 28:21.600
that made everyone change their minds.

28:21.600 --> 28:23.160
Those things are important

28:23.160 --> 28:25.040
and these movements are spearheaded

28:25.040 --> 28:28.200
by powerful groups of people who make these arguments

28:28.200 --> 28:29.200
in the public sphere.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.320
I wouldn't be out here talking to you

28:30.320 --> 28:32.520
if I didn't think ideas were important.

28:32.520 --> 28:34.600
But I do also think that a lot of the big shifts

28:34.600 --> 28:35.920
that we see can be traced back

28:35.920 --> 28:40.920
to what happens in politics and economics, basically.

28:41.160 --> 28:46.160
And in the 80s, you did see this big shift towards

28:46.720 --> 28:51.480
the creation of the kind of individual investor entrepreneur,

28:51.480 --> 28:54.560
the mini capitalist, basically.

28:54.560 --> 28:59.560
And that was a very self-conscious shift

28:59.560 --> 29:02.120
that was functional both politically

29:02.120 --> 29:04.840
and to the kind of economic transition

29:04.840 --> 29:06.880
that we saw during the 80s.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.360
So the reason it was functional politically

29:08.360 --> 29:10.280
is what we've already heard, right?

29:10.280 --> 29:13.720
If you replace a sense of collective agency

29:13.720 --> 29:16.360
among people who are part of the working class

29:16.360 --> 29:17.960
with this individualized sense of agency

29:17.960 --> 29:20.640
that's like, I own my house, I have my own pension,

29:20.640 --> 29:23.720
I care more about what the stock market is doing

29:23.720 --> 29:26.160
than the average wage share of national income

29:26.160 --> 29:28.000
because my pension's invested in that.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.320
I care about what's going on in the housing market.

29:30.320 --> 29:33.640
And I know that basically the more freedom we give the banks,

29:33.640 --> 29:34.720
the better my pension will do

29:34.720 --> 29:37.760
and the better my house will do.

29:37.760 --> 29:41.400
So that political shift is great for the conservative party

29:41.400 --> 29:43.200
and ultimately forces the Labour Party

29:43.200 --> 29:45.480
to kind of adapt and shift its position

29:45.480 --> 29:48.200
to accommodate neoliberalism as well.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.640
And you get this neoliberal consensus

29:50.640 --> 29:52.360
among all the major political parties.

29:52.360 --> 29:53.520
But there is, as you mentioned,

29:53.520 --> 29:57.120
this kind of economic underpinning to it as well.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.120
And yeah, those shifts become functional

30:00.120 --> 30:03.080
to basically the financialization of the economy as well.

30:04.200 --> 30:08.240
I don't want to kind of get too into the nitty-gritty of this,

30:08.240 --> 30:11.840
but things like pensions privatization, right?

30:12.720 --> 30:16.320
It adds to this massive pool of capital

30:16.320 --> 30:19.080
that can be played around with by the financial sector

30:19.080 --> 30:21.040
by these huge asset managers

30:21.040 --> 30:23.920
that we now have, institutions like BlackRock, for example,

30:23.920 --> 30:26.040
which I write about in the book.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.560
It's this institution that controls

30:27.560 --> 30:29.280
other people's money, basically,

30:29.280 --> 30:32.360
and is invested in most companies,

30:32.360 --> 30:33.640
most large companies in the world,

30:33.640 --> 30:35.840
just because it has indices that track

30:35.840 --> 30:37.600
what goes on in the stock market.

30:37.600 --> 30:41.480
And you have basically, as a result of that investment power,

30:41.480 --> 30:43.720
the head of BlackRock is able to write

30:43.720 --> 30:46.360
to the corporations that BlackRock has invested in,

30:46.360 --> 30:48.280
which is basically every large corporation on earth

30:48.280 --> 30:50.120
and say, we think you should do this,

30:50.120 --> 30:52.000
we think you should do that, right?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.640
That is not the way that a free market is supposed to function.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.000
A free market is supposed to be lots of little individual people

30:57.000 --> 30:58.160
putting their money into a pot,

30:58.160 --> 31:00.200
and then the money goes to the most profitable firms

31:00.200 --> 31:01.760
because that's how the market works.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.760
It's not like these huge behemoths

31:04.760 --> 31:07.840
that are basically able to direct and plan

31:07.840 --> 31:09.400
what happens within markets.

31:09.400 --> 31:13.080
That's kind of contrary to how we're told

31:13.080 --> 31:14.960
capitalism is supposed to work.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.760
So that kind of shift towards financialization

31:16.760 --> 31:19.040
was really facilitated by, yeah,

31:19.040 --> 31:20.560
things like pension privatization.

31:20.560 --> 31:25.280
And obviously, the long boom of the 1990s,

31:25.280 --> 31:26.400
which had, I mean, it's just,

31:26.400 --> 31:31.400
it's difficult to begin to kind of categorize the shift

31:32.120 --> 31:34.560
that that moved towards the kind of

31:34.560 --> 31:37.280
home-owning democracy had on our politics

31:37.280 --> 31:38.400
and our economics, right?

31:38.400 --> 31:40.520
If you think about that, like the long 1990s

31:40.520 --> 31:43.880
from the end of the first housing market crash

31:43.880 --> 31:45.720
and kind of like the early 1990s,

31:45.720 --> 31:48.400
when house prices just skyrocketed

31:48.400 --> 31:51.160
because you had the complete unleashing

31:51.160 --> 31:54.680
of the power of finance, everyone could get a mortgage.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.800
It seemed like there was just this endless pool of money

31:56.800 --> 31:59.200
that was circulating around the world economy.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.640
People did buy their houses often on the cheap,

32:01.640 --> 32:02.840
through right to buy.

32:02.840 --> 32:07.000
You suddenly created this class of asset owners

32:07.000 --> 32:10.160
who were much more identified with house prices

32:10.160 --> 32:12.080
and the performance of the stock market

32:12.080 --> 32:13.960
than they were anything else.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.440
You had just this, you know,

32:16.480 --> 32:18.480
astonishing wave of globalization as well

32:18.480 --> 32:20.160
that happened throughout the global economy.

32:20.160 --> 32:24.000
And there was this like incredible optimism

32:24.000 --> 32:26.440
that was among the kind of the capitalist class

32:26.440 --> 32:28.120
at this point that Gordon Brown said,

32:28.120 --> 32:29.880
we've ended boom and bust.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.400
There were all these economists saying,

32:31.400 --> 32:33.600
we're gonna liberate the poor world.

32:33.600 --> 32:37.160
You know, the former communist countries

32:37.160 --> 32:40.160
are gonna become, you know, these free market utopias.

32:41.400 --> 32:43.640
But like up to 2007,

32:43.640 --> 32:46.960
just the kind of millenarian like optimism

32:46.960 --> 32:49.120
of those who were supporting this

32:49.120 --> 32:51.480
like neoliberal financialized shift was,

32:51.480 --> 32:53.040
it was hard to argue against, right?

32:53.040 --> 32:54.000
Even for those on the left,

32:54.000 --> 32:55.880
there was the sense that, yeah, you know, fine,

32:55.880 --> 32:57.440
capitalism's kind of won.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.000
Like what can we really do other than like-

33:00.000 --> 33:00.840
And history.

33:00.840 --> 33:01.960
Exactly, yeah.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.400
And then you get the financial crisis

33:03.400 --> 33:07.520
and you realize that all of that was just based on

33:07.520 --> 33:10.040
not only a kind of lie, a political lie,

33:10.040 --> 33:12.840
but also just deeply unsustainable economics.

33:13.760 --> 33:18.760
And a politics which has really just like torn apart

33:20.240 --> 33:21.800
the fabric of our society.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.120
And we're living with the result of that now.

33:24.120 --> 33:27.200
We're living with the result of the kind of the arrogance

33:27.200 --> 33:31.760
of the ideologues of capital during their heyday.

33:31.760 --> 33:36.640
And yet, because they were so successful

33:36.640 --> 33:39.720
in like shattering our sense of collective agency

33:39.720 --> 33:42.280
and our ability to imagine a different world,

33:42.280 --> 33:43.960
we haven't moved beyond that.

33:43.960 --> 33:46.480
And it's just kind of like people fiddling around the edges

33:46.480 --> 33:49.160
being like, how do we get back to before the financial crisis

33:49.160 --> 33:51.200
without the acknowledgement that there is no going back?

33:51.200 --> 33:52.520
So to get beyond that then,

33:52.520 --> 33:55.240
and I'm struck again by our use of the word sort of power,

33:55.240 --> 33:57.000
right, in relation to this sort of untrammeled

33:57.000 --> 34:01.200
financialization and in the face of that,

34:01.200 --> 34:02.840
you know, these ginormous corporations,

34:02.840 --> 34:05.160
these ginormous financial institutions,

34:05.160 --> 34:09.120
we have individualized sort of atomized, fractured people

34:09.120 --> 34:10.120
in our society.

34:11.080 --> 34:14.840
So how effective is something like trade union organization?

34:14.840 --> 34:16.920
How effective is something like an expanding

34:16.920 --> 34:19.960
sort of collective consciousness in combating

34:19.960 --> 34:21.880
and dealing with those forces?

34:21.880 --> 34:25.400
Because, I don't know, I look at Port Talbot, right?

34:25.400 --> 34:28.080
Thousands of job losses for the steel workers there.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.840
And it connects to what we're talking about, right?

34:30.840 --> 34:32.320
Because it's not just a job loss.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.920
It is literally like the community,

34:34.920 --> 34:38.880
the sense of sort of collective pride place,

34:39.600 --> 34:40.960
yeah, sense of home almost,

34:40.960 --> 34:43.960
and that collapsing has deep, deep ramifications.

34:45.040 --> 34:48.240
So in a sentence, sort of how effective is trade union

34:48.240 --> 34:50.240
organization or similar mechanisms

34:50.240 --> 34:53.560
in confronting these incredibly powerful institutions?

34:53.560 --> 34:55.720
I think the problem that we have with organizing today

34:55.720 --> 35:00.080
is that even collective institutions have been,

35:01.880 --> 35:05.280
you know, paralyzed by this sense of individualism.

35:05.280 --> 35:08.280
They've kind of been infected by individualism.

35:08.280 --> 35:11.960
So if you go back to, I write in, again, in the book

35:11.960 --> 35:13.520
about the example of the Lukas plan.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.640
So, you know, contrast what happened at Boeing,

35:16.640 --> 35:18.360
or, you know, indeed what happened at Port Talbot

35:18.360 --> 35:19.640
with the example of the workers

35:19.640 --> 35:21.800
at Lukas Aerospace in the 1970s.

35:21.800 --> 35:25.080
Their plan, well, their company was kind of under threat

35:25.080 --> 35:26.960
from rising competition from abroad.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.920
They appealed to the then labor government

35:28.920 --> 35:31.320
saying, we want you to nationalize us.

35:31.320 --> 35:33.520
And Tony Bend and their minister for trade and industry

35:33.520 --> 35:36.240
replied and said, we can't do that right now.

35:36.240 --> 35:37.720
You guys need to come up with a plan

35:37.720 --> 35:39.440
as to how you can save this firm yourself.

35:39.440 --> 35:41.120
And Ben was, again, one of these big believers

35:41.120 --> 35:42.840
in democratic socialism.

35:42.840 --> 35:46.240
And so the workers were like, right, okay, what do we do?

35:46.240 --> 35:49.560
And the union representatives basically surveyed

35:49.560 --> 35:51.480
all of the workers at Lukas Aerospace

35:51.480 --> 35:53.560
and said, what do you think we should do?

35:53.560 --> 35:55.680
How could we transform the operation

35:55.680 --> 35:59.520
of this largely weapons manufacturer, basically?

35:59.520 --> 36:01.120
And the workers came back and they said,

36:01.120 --> 36:02.680
we need to transform this institution

36:02.680 --> 36:06.440
into a worker owned, democratically run organization

36:06.440 --> 36:09.280
that produces socially useful commodities,

36:09.280 --> 36:11.600
not weapons, basically.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.840
And they put together this document called the Lukas Plan,

36:13.840 --> 36:16.600
which was just probably one of the most radical documents

36:16.600 --> 36:18.080
in Britain's economic history.

36:19.120 --> 36:22.320
It comprised ideas that had been put forward

36:22.320 --> 36:25.520
by workers from throughout Lukas Aerospace

36:25.520 --> 36:27.760
to use the tools and the skills

36:27.760 --> 36:28.800
that were then available to them

36:28.800 --> 36:30.400
to transition from the production of weapons

36:30.400 --> 36:34.080
to things like kidney dialysis machines, wind turbines,

36:34.080 --> 36:36.040
things that would be useful for society.

36:36.040 --> 36:38.800
And at the same time, these workers had said,

36:38.800 --> 36:40.400
this is how we'll manage ourselves.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.920
This will be the ownership structure of the organization.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.640
This is the way that we'll transition

36:44.640 --> 36:45.960
to this new way of working.

36:45.960 --> 36:50.760
It was this incredible business plan, basically,

36:50.760 --> 36:55.760
that totally undermined the spirit of capitalism,

36:56.160 --> 36:58.200
which is that the owners own the firm,

36:58.200 --> 37:00.080
the managers manage the firm on their behalf

37:00.080 --> 37:01.480
and the workers do as they're told.

37:01.480 --> 37:02.720
And this is all based on the idea

37:02.720 --> 37:04.480
that entrepreneurs and workers and managers

37:04.480 --> 37:06.080
are these really clever people

37:06.080 --> 37:08.120
who just know how an organization should work

37:08.120 --> 37:09.960
and are really good at telling people what to do.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.400
And workers at Lukas Aerospace were like,

37:11.400 --> 37:13.800
no, we know exactly how this firm should be run.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.000
We know what we should be doing.

37:15.000 --> 37:17.240
We're perfectly capable of managing ourselves.

37:17.240 --> 37:20.360
And that's why it was so much more threatening

37:20.360 --> 37:21.720
to the established order

37:21.720 --> 37:23.640
than even the idea of nationalization.

37:23.640 --> 37:24.480
There's loads of companies

37:24.480 --> 37:25.600
that were nationalized at the time.

37:25.600 --> 37:27.360
This was something else entirely.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.320
It threatened this idea

37:29.320 --> 37:32.480
that people need to be managed and controlled.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.600
And I think that is actually the most threatening thing

37:36.600 --> 37:39.480
that the most threatening thing that we can believe

37:39.480 --> 37:40.680
in a capitalist economy.

37:40.680 --> 37:42.680
It's that we don't need to be managed and controlled,

37:42.680 --> 37:46.720
that we have the power to govern ourselves, basically.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.480
And there are a load of really amazing examples

37:49.480 --> 37:51.320
of people doing exactly that in the book.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.800
One of the ones that's closest to my heart,

37:52.800 --> 37:54.280
you know, we mentioned Port Talbot,

37:54.280 --> 37:55.760
there's this little town in North Wales

37:55.760 --> 37:57.520
called Blyneifestiniog,

37:57.520 --> 37:59.720
which is one of these kind of left behind areas.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.240
It's a former slate mining community.

38:02.240 --> 38:06.160
And instead of kind of, you know,

38:06.160 --> 38:08.560
allowing themselves to be consigned to this idea

38:08.560 --> 38:09.960
of like a left behind neighborhood,

38:09.960 --> 38:11.920
the people in this town got together.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.440
A few people started and they basically said,

38:13.440 --> 38:16.200
we're going to start a community enterprise

38:16.200 --> 38:17.840
to create jobs in the local area

38:17.840 --> 38:19.720
and give people a fighting chance.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.320
And as soon as people saw a couple of people do this,

38:22.320 --> 38:25.160
they were like, why can't we set up a community enterprise?

38:25.160 --> 38:27.520
Why can't we set up a community owned energy company

38:27.520 --> 38:29.200
that will provide us with cheap energy

38:29.200 --> 38:32.040
instead of, you know, paying tons of money

38:32.040 --> 38:34.040
to these, you know, privatized utility companies

38:34.040 --> 38:37.680
when there's hydroelectric power that's being, you know,

38:37.680 --> 38:40.480
monopolized by this corporation

38:40.480 --> 38:42.240
that's extracting all the wealth from this community.

38:42.240 --> 38:45.400
We could actually just generate our own power ourselves.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.520
And suddenly you had all of these community enterprises

38:47.520 --> 38:51.000
springing up, just this incredible ethos of self-help.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.560
There was some support through something called

38:52.560 --> 38:54.880
the community's first program by the Welsh government.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.080
But largely speaking, this was people just being like,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.960
we don't have to accept things being this way.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.240
We see a similar sort of thing in Preston, for example,

39:03.240 --> 39:04.960
where you have the community wealth building agenda,

39:04.960 --> 39:07.920
the council is supporting the creation of cooperatives,

39:07.920 --> 39:10.800
democratic, local banking, all these different things.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.280
The participatory budgeting movement

39:12.280 --> 39:14.920
that's spread around the world where, you know,

39:14.920 --> 39:16.240
residents are given the power

39:16.240 --> 39:18.480
to determine how their municipal budget is spent.

39:18.480 --> 39:21.040
The evidence is just so, so clear

39:21.040 --> 39:24.800
that when people start to believe that they have the power

39:24.800 --> 39:26.280
to be able to govern themselves,

39:26.280 --> 39:29.200
to be able to make decisions about their communities,

39:29.200 --> 39:30.640
about their workplaces,

39:30.640 --> 39:34.400
they take that power and they wield it in service

39:34.400 --> 39:36.960
of the collective, of their community,

39:36.960 --> 39:38.600
of, you know, the people around them.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.520
They basically use it to build socialism.

39:41.520 --> 39:44.480
And the biggest thing standing in the way

39:44.480 --> 39:46.680
of our getting from here to there

39:46.680 --> 39:50.040
is just this pervasive and widespread belief

39:50.040 --> 39:52.840
that I am on my own, there's nothing I can do.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.520
The powers that are united against me are too strong

39:55.520 --> 39:58.240
and, you know, no one else wants to work

39:58.240 --> 40:00.280
with me to change things.

40:00.280 --> 40:01.440
Which is actually why I believe, you know,

40:01.440 --> 40:04.040
I'm not saying that all these small individual examples

40:04.040 --> 40:07.720
of the resistance to capitalism or neoliberalism

40:07.720 --> 40:09.920
are going to be enough to shift the nature

40:09.920 --> 40:10.960
of the whole system.

40:10.960 --> 40:13.160
What I am saying is the biggest thing

40:13.160 --> 40:16.280
standing between us and progressive change

40:16.280 --> 40:18.640
is basically individualism.

40:18.640 --> 40:21.800
And these examples of people working together

40:21.800 --> 40:26.400
to resist their exploitation, to build better communities,

40:26.400 --> 40:29.600
they just shatter individualism.

40:29.600 --> 40:32.320
You go to these communities and people do not share

40:32.320 --> 40:34.920
this like individualistic, competitive mindset.

40:34.920 --> 40:37.560
They have, you know, their own personal dreams

40:37.560 --> 40:39.600
and aspirations and wants and a secure sense

40:39.600 --> 40:42.880
of their own self, but they also view their identity

40:42.880 --> 40:46.000
as tied to what happens to the people around them.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.920
I'm really struck by these examples

40:48.920 --> 40:51.920
of what a better future possibly looks like

40:51.920 --> 40:53.400
within the context of what you said earlier

40:53.400 --> 40:54.600
about our political paradigm,

40:54.600 --> 40:57.840
that there is essentially basically a binary, right,

40:57.840 --> 41:00.720
about the size of the state and the size of welfare.

41:00.720 --> 41:04.480
So how do you see that better future sitting within

41:05.760 --> 41:07.440
something that kind of, I guess you could call

41:07.440 --> 41:10.320
technocratic governance, the sort of the managerialism

41:10.320 --> 41:13.320
of Prime Minister Sunak or likely a Prime Minister Stammer?

41:13.320 --> 41:17.800
Yeah, I mean, it just means democratizing everything.

41:17.800 --> 41:22.800
Like just demanding more power being handed down to

41:22.800 --> 41:25.480
whether that's, you know, local communities,

41:25.480 --> 41:27.800
whether it's, you know, devolution and decentralization

41:27.800 --> 41:30.720
whether it's demanding workers are able to take power

41:30.720 --> 41:33.560
within their organizations, you know,

41:33.560 --> 41:37.680
the removal of the massive restrictions

41:37.680 --> 41:39.120
that have been placed on our rights

41:39.120 --> 41:42.720
to do things like protest and assemble and speak out

41:42.720 --> 41:46.320
against, you know, the horrors that are being committed

41:46.320 --> 41:48.920
by our government here and all over the world.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.200
It really requires like a reinvigoration

41:51.200 --> 41:53.480
at the political level when we're thinking about politics,

41:53.480 --> 41:57.840
a reinvigoration of the idea of democracy, basically.

41:57.840 --> 42:00.720
Now we live in a country where the kind of liberal

42:00.720 --> 42:03.400
democratic revolution of the kind that, you know,

42:03.400 --> 42:06.000
we saw during the 1800s, that hasn't even been completed.

42:06.000 --> 42:06.880
We've still got a monarchy.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.200
We've still got an unelected chamber in the House of Lords.

42:09.200 --> 42:12.240
We still have a private corporation that runs,

42:12.240 --> 42:14.200
you know, the heart of our financial sector,

42:14.200 --> 42:15.280
the City of London Corporation,

42:15.280 --> 42:18.960
which is a private corporation in the guise

42:18.960 --> 42:20.700
of a public local authority.

42:20.740 --> 42:24.300
So we have all these hangovers from the feudal era,

42:24.300 --> 42:27.020
the undermined democratic processes.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.980
And on top of that, we have these neoliberal shifts

42:29.980 --> 42:33.140
that have aimed to insulate even more areas of the state

42:33.140 --> 42:35.780
from democratic accountability.

42:35.780 --> 42:37.820
So, you know, we have like the Bank of England

42:37.820 --> 42:40.420
being made independent, i.e.,

42:40.420 --> 42:42.100
not subject to democratic scrutiny,

42:42.100 --> 42:44.300
which means that its decisions are much more likely

42:44.300 --> 42:47.660
to be influenced by the, you know, financial sector

42:47.660 --> 42:49.180
that has the air of bank officials

42:49.180 --> 42:52.380
than they are the preferences of ordinary people.

42:52.380 --> 42:56.540
You have just the outsourcing of huge swathes

42:56.540 --> 42:59.340
of public services to private corporations

42:59.340 --> 43:01.980
that, you know, you cannot really control.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.100
You cannot really hold accountable.

43:03.100 --> 43:04.860
They're supposed to be held accountable by the government,

43:04.860 --> 43:07.700
but the people who write the contracts

43:07.700 --> 43:10.060
according to which these services are procured

43:10.060 --> 43:12.540
also consult for the firms that are bidding

43:12.540 --> 43:13.380
for those contracts.

43:13.380 --> 43:16.300
It's this kind of revolving door of corporate power

43:16.300 --> 43:19.580
that connects like public sector institutions

43:19.580 --> 43:22.460
with private sector outsourcing organizations.

43:22.460 --> 43:24.460
There's no real democratic accountability there.

43:24.460 --> 43:26.500
You've seen a massive centralization of power.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.340
You know, when Thatcher came to power,

43:28.340 --> 43:30.980
she smashed the GLC.

43:30.980 --> 43:34.220
The guy who was instrumental in putting together

43:34.220 --> 43:37.500
the Lucas Plan after he was fired from Lucas

43:37.500 --> 43:40.140
for union organizing went to work for the GLC,

43:40.140 --> 43:42.460
the Greater London Corporation,

43:42.460 --> 43:45.140
which was then kind of sponsoring

43:46.140 --> 43:47.780
these ideas around how you could make

43:47.780 --> 43:49.220
democratic planning a reality,

43:49.220 --> 43:50.620
how you could start to bring the ideas

43:50.620 --> 43:53.860
that we saw at Lucas Aerospace to the public sector.

43:53.860 --> 43:57.380
Thatcher crushed the GLC precisely because

43:57.380 --> 43:59.940
it was doing some of that interesting experimentation.

43:59.940 --> 44:01.700
We're seeing, again, this kind of revival

44:01.700 --> 44:03.980
of that type of movement around democratic planning

44:03.980 --> 44:05.340
in places like Preston.

44:05.340 --> 44:08.020
And that's why places like Preston

44:08.020 --> 44:10.060
is seen as so threatening to the State of Squire.

44:10.060 --> 44:12.460
It's why we haven't seen what should be like...

44:13.420 --> 44:15.260
I spoke to a conservative the other day

44:15.260 --> 44:17.300
who said that community wealth building

44:17.300 --> 44:18.940
should be a conservative policy.

44:18.940 --> 44:20.780
It should be handing power back to communities,

44:20.780 --> 44:24.540
but they can't accept the idea that that would happen

44:24.540 --> 44:27.260
because it runs contrary to this spirit of hierarchy

44:27.260 --> 44:29.420
that is really what underpins capitalism.

44:30.860 --> 44:35.740
So, yeah, that shift towards community power

44:35.740 --> 44:39.620
and towards worker power and people power

44:39.620 --> 44:42.740
is so deeply threatening to the status quo.

44:42.740 --> 44:47.740
And it really requires us to just like,

44:48.780 --> 44:52.540
yes, kind of combat this mindset of individualism

44:52.540 --> 44:54.340
and also just like resist.

44:54.340 --> 44:57.580
It becomes so hard to think about

44:59.740 --> 45:02.740
constructive ways of resisting in the system that we have.

45:02.740 --> 45:04.620
All we can do is we kind of go online

45:04.620 --> 45:06.540
and we may be like fire off an angry tweet

45:06.540 --> 45:09.100
every now and again because we look at the system

45:09.100 --> 45:10.540
and it seems so broken.

45:10.540 --> 45:13.060
But actually, if you're able to kind of get offline

45:13.060 --> 45:16.820
and get into spaces where people are organizing with tenants

45:16.820 --> 45:18.860
to like prevent rogue landlords,

45:18.860 --> 45:21.580
organizing with migrants to support them

45:22.580 --> 45:24.180
to fight for their rights,

45:24.180 --> 45:25.980
just protesting on the street, getting out

45:25.980 --> 45:30.980
and making your voice heard to the political class.

45:31.340 --> 45:33.660
All of these forms of resistance are,

45:35.580 --> 45:37.980
yes, they're reactive, but they're also constructive

45:37.980 --> 45:39.300
because you start to build these bonds

45:39.300 --> 45:42.620
and these subjectivities that allow us to think beyond

45:42.620 --> 45:46.500
this like toxic individualism and hierarchy

45:46.500 --> 45:50.060
that makes up our current system.

45:50.060 --> 45:52.460
That's really interesting because my inclination is

45:52.460 --> 45:55.980
to compare us with the two main possible

45:55.980 --> 45:58.100
political vehicles for government in this country

45:58.100 --> 46:00.020
as technocratic organizations,

46:00.020 --> 46:02.580
particularly under Labour and the Kids at the moment.

46:02.580 --> 46:04.340
We're just hearing you then talking about street politics,

46:04.340 --> 46:06.020
participatory street politics.

46:06.020 --> 46:07.900
And I'm admittedly, I'm thinking about this now.

46:07.900 --> 46:09.660
So I don't know if you'll stand up to particularly much

46:09.660 --> 46:11.780
scrutiny, but in light of the shenanigans

46:11.780 --> 46:13.060
that are going on in Parliament right now,

46:13.060 --> 46:14.700
I mean, there may well be a different speaker

46:14.700 --> 46:15.900
of House of Commons by the time this is,

46:15.900 --> 46:18.900
so let's park that for the time being.

46:18.900 --> 46:22.140
But the Labour Party's position on Gaza,

46:22.140 --> 46:22.980
and I'm not trying to talk about Gaza,

46:22.980 --> 46:24.380
I want to talk about street politics here,

46:24.380 --> 46:27.860
it's changed, it's moved, it's gone from the permission

46:27.860 --> 46:31.340
of Israel to impose collective punishment on Gaza

46:31.340 --> 46:33.620
to calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

46:33.620 --> 46:36.700
And I think you, I want to think,

46:37.060 --> 46:39.500
I want to think that the fact that hundreds of thousands

46:39.500 --> 46:41.460
of people have turned out on the streets of London

46:41.460 --> 46:43.220
weekend after weekend,

46:43.220 --> 46:45.220
has made some kind of difference to that.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.300
Maybe I'm being naive.

46:46.300 --> 46:48.220
I think it's more to do with the fact

46:48.220 --> 46:52.820
that the American state's position is slightly marginally

46:52.820 --> 46:55.180
shifting as a result of the utter chaos

46:55.180 --> 46:57.180
that's going to be unleashed as a result of this conflict

46:57.180 --> 47:00.420
and that Britain basically follows tail between its legs,

47:00.420 --> 47:01.380
everything that happened.

47:01.380 --> 47:03.300
We have effectively no independent foreign policy,

47:03.300 --> 47:06.540
we just kind of follow mindlessly what's going on

47:06.540 --> 47:08.820
in the US, but having said that,

47:08.820 --> 47:10.660
part of the reason that the situation is becoming

47:10.660 --> 47:13.060
so untenable over there and over here

47:13.060 --> 47:16.460
is because people are refusing, as you say,

47:16.460 --> 47:19.500
to just accept the mainstream narrative

47:19.500 --> 47:20.660
as to what's going on.

47:20.660 --> 47:21.860
I know so many people,

47:21.860 --> 47:24.660
and I think this is a widespread feeling

47:24.660 --> 47:26.020
when it comes to particularly what's going on

47:26.020 --> 47:27.740
at the moment in Gaza.

47:27.740 --> 47:31.380
You go online and you see just the raw footage

47:31.380 --> 47:36.380
that's being posted of people's limbs being blown off

47:36.620 --> 47:39.540
by weapons that are being sold to the Israeli state

47:39.540 --> 47:40.940
by our government.

47:40.940 --> 47:43.220
And then you look at the news

47:43.220 --> 47:47.620
and it's just the same propaganda

47:47.620 --> 47:49.100
that's being repeated over and over again,

47:49.100 --> 47:53.460
barely any mention of the actual state of affairs

47:53.460 --> 47:55.220
on the ground in Palestine.

47:55.220 --> 47:57.900
Very rarely do you see a Palestinian voice

47:57.900 --> 48:02.020
out there kind of advocating for their people.

48:03.020 --> 48:05.180
Even when we had the ruling in the ICJ,

48:05.180 --> 48:08.220
that was barely covered on the day

48:08.220 --> 48:12.740
that we heard evidence against Israel.

48:13.900 --> 48:17.020
And I think that creates this sense of unreality.

48:17.020 --> 48:18.180
I've heard so many people say,

48:18.180 --> 48:20.460
it feels like I'm going insane

48:20.460 --> 48:22.540
because you see what is happening

48:22.540 --> 48:24.620
and then you go to institutions

48:24.620 --> 48:27.460
that you kind of think that you should broadly trust

48:27.460 --> 48:28.820
to tell you the truth

48:28.820 --> 48:33.540
and you see things are one-sided or ignored

48:33.620 --> 48:37.140
or just like kind of skewed.

48:37.140 --> 48:38.460
And then you start to think,

48:38.460 --> 48:40.260
well, where else is this happening?

48:40.260 --> 48:41.900
And it's not obviously just happening

48:41.900 --> 48:43.380
in Gaza at the moment.

48:43.380 --> 48:47.100
Like last year and for a long time now,

48:47.100 --> 48:48.460
we've been seeing basically a genocide

48:48.460 --> 48:50.660
that's been happening in Ethiopia and Tigray.

48:50.660 --> 48:51.580
No reporting on that

48:51.580 --> 48:55.300
because it doesn't meet the foreign policy objectives

48:55.300 --> 48:57.100
of the British state for people to know about that.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.740
Same thing is happening in Sudan

48:58.740 --> 49:00.020
or in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

49:00.020 --> 49:02.020
There are all these conflicts

49:02.020 --> 49:03.500
that we just don't hear about

49:03.500 --> 49:06.940
and instead we hear constantly endless coverage

49:06.940 --> 49:08.500
about what's going on in Ukraine

49:08.500 --> 49:10.980
because it meets the foreign policy objectives

49:10.980 --> 49:13.540
of the British state for people to know

49:13.540 --> 49:16.380
that Russia is doing objectively horrible things.

49:16.380 --> 49:18.060
But there are lots of other governments around the world

49:18.060 --> 49:19.580
that are doing objectively horrible things,

49:19.580 --> 49:20.700
including our own.

49:20.700 --> 49:23.500
Many governments being funded by the British government,

49:23.500 --> 49:25.300
being provided arms by the British government

49:25.300 --> 49:26.740
that are also doing horrible things.

49:26.740 --> 49:28.300
And yet we hear nothing about that

49:28.300 --> 49:30.020
because it doesn't meet the foreign policy objectives

49:30.020 --> 49:31.020
of the British state.

49:31.020 --> 49:35.620
And I think this really comes down to a question of like,

49:35.620 --> 49:38.100
I don't think that the presenters on the BBC

49:38.100 --> 49:41.740
are like deliberately skewing the output

49:41.740 --> 49:42.940
that they put out there.

49:42.940 --> 49:46.220
What I do think is that how is the news agenda formed?

49:46.220 --> 49:47.460
Like how is the news reported?

49:47.460 --> 49:49.940
It's reported based on what happens in the papers, right?

49:49.940 --> 49:51.220
There's always a paper review.

49:51.220 --> 49:52.460
What determines what goes in the papers?

49:52.460 --> 49:54.300
Well, these are literally owned by like oligarchs

49:54.300 --> 49:55.700
and like massive corporations

49:55.700 --> 49:58.420
that just exist to promote their own interests.

49:58.420 --> 50:02.500
Or it is determined by what politicians say.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.460
So politicians in many ways kind of shape the news agenda.

50:04.460 --> 50:06.660
I remember talking to a presenter not that long ago

50:06.660 --> 50:08.580
who was like, well, if you want this item

50:08.580 --> 50:09.420
to be on the news agenda,

50:09.420 --> 50:11.940
then you need to get Kya Starma to say something about it

50:11.940 --> 50:13.300
because otherwise we can't report on it.

50:13.300 --> 50:15.860
It's not news, like that wouldn't be kind of objective.

50:15.860 --> 50:18.500
So when you have this, you know,

50:18.500 --> 50:20.700
narrowing of the political agenda

50:20.700 --> 50:23.580
among the two biggest political parties,

50:23.580 --> 50:26.420
the news follows and it creates this air of unreality

50:26.420 --> 50:27.260
because you're like,

50:27.260 --> 50:30.380
why aren't we hearing about some of the biggest,

50:30.380 --> 50:31.220
like most important issues?

50:31.220 --> 50:33.100
If you want to move away from, you know,

50:33.100 --> 50:34.060
questions around conflict,

50:34.060 --> 50:36.500
why aren't we hearing about the fact much more frequently

50:36.500 --> 50:38.020
that like last year was, you know,

50:38.020 --> 50:39.740
potentially the warmest year on record,

50:39.740 --> 50:43.380
maybe we're starting to see breaching the Paris agreements

50:43.380 --> 50:46.340
about 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

50:46.340 --> 50:47.940
Like these massive matter of issues

50:47.940 --> 50:51.020
that literally determine whether or not people live or die,

50:51.020 --> 50:52.780
that determine the future of humanity,

50:52.780 --> 50:54.340
we don't see them being covered

50:55.300 --> 50:58.860
because of this just like insulation

50:58.860 --> 51:00.940
like of our political class

51:00.940 --> 51:02.980
from democratic accountability.

51:02.980 --> 51:06.500
And the way that we have seen that begin to shift

51:06.500 --> 51:08.620
is when people get out onto the streets.

51:08.620 --> 51:10.820
You know, when you do have a protest that is big enough,

51:10.820 --> 51:12.420
we saw this, I remember actually,

51:12.420 --> 51:14.980
I think it was during the 2019 election campaign,

51:14.980 --> 51:16.980
suddenly climate became an issue.

51:16.980 --> 51:19.020
Like it almost kind of, it didn't come out of nowhere,

51:19.020 --> 51:20.260
but it felt like it came out of nowhere

51:20.260 --> 51:22.220
because these people were pouring onto the streets

51:22.220 --> 51:25.740
and saying, we demand action on this, right?

51:25.740 --> 51:28.700
And, you know, I think it is interesting seeing

51:28.700 --> 51:32.500
how public opinion and the news agenda can begin to shift

51:32.500 --> 51:35.020
when you do actually get people organizing

51:35.020 --> 51:38.780
to demand a different way of doing politics.

51:38.780 --> 51:40.060
It's really interesting to hear you say that

51:40.060 --> 51:44.260
because the sort of the way the British political media

51:44.260 --> 51:45.820
has covered the environment recently

51:45.820 --> 51:47.780
is basically in the context of whether or not

51:47.780 --> 51:50.220
labor is gonna spend 28 billion pounds of capitalization

51:50.220 --> 51:51.060
on it rather.

51:51.060 --> 51:54.100
And it becomes kind of a Westminster political story

51:54.100 --> 51:56.660
about to what extent labor is going to borrow to invest,

51:56.660 --> 51:57.820
which can be a high-minded one

51:57.820 --> 52:00.060
if it's had in the right way, I don't think it is,

52:00.060 --> 52:03.820
rather than is the price of the future ecological viability

52:03.820 --> 52:05.260
of the planet 28 billion pounds.

52:05.260 --> 52:06.100
Yeah.

52:06.100 --> 52:08.420
And the people who use job is that it will say,

52:08.420 --> 52:10.140
well, it's not my job to report on that.

52:10.140 --> 52:11.900
That's up to climate scientists or whatever.

52:11.900 --> 52:15.180
And it's like, well, what is the point in the news

52:15.180 --> 52:18.180
if it's literally just telling us like the shenanigans

52:18.220 --> 52:22.020
and the gossip of these just like closed-minded,

52:22.020 --> 52:24.620
half of them are corrupt politicians

52:24.620 --> 52:27.180
that are like swanning around Westminster being like,

52:27.180 --> 52:29.580
well, you know, I am completely in control

52:29.580 --> 52:30.740
of this democracy and everyone else

52:30.740 --> 52:32.020
will do what I tell them to do.

52:32.020 --> 52:36.060
Like, it's just, this is why it's actually so good

52:36.060 --> 52:39.380
to have such a growing and vibrant alternative media

52:39.380 --> 52:41.780
in this country because I do think, you know,

52:41.780 --> 52:43.860
that juxtaposition I was talking about

52:43.860 --> 52:45.380
between what you see online and what you see in the news

52:45.380 --> 52:47.860
is pushing people away from those mainstream sources

52:47.860 --> 52:50.940
and actually encouraging people to get their analysis

52:50.940 --> 52:53.220
and the depth of the analysis that they want.

52:53.220 --> 52:55.460
Places like here, for example.

52:55.460 --> 52:57.260
And the Vara attribute where I work.

52:57.260 --> 52:59.420
Absolutely, yeah, very much so.

52:59.420 --> 53:00.900
Last question for you and I'll try and leave it

53:00.900 --> 53:03.220
on a slightly more optimistic note.

53:03.220 --> 53:04.060
Yeah.

53:04.060 --> 53:05.820
You write in the book,

53:05.820 --> 53:08.100
since that political debate has failed to break out

53:08.100 --> 53:09.780
of a sterile dichotomy, those on the left argue

53:09.780 --> 53:11.780
for higher public spending funded by taxes on the rich,

53:11.780 --> 53:13.780
those on the right argue for cuts to public spending in tax.

53:13.780 --> 53:15.980
When we accede to the idea that politics is a battle

53:15.980 --> 53:17.020
between the state and the market,

53:17.020 --> 53:19.900
we play into the hands of the right.

53:19.900 --> 53:22.860
So what should the left be presenting as an argument

53:22.860 --> 53:27.660
or as a belief system to try and transcend that dichotomy?

53:27.660 --> 53:32.540
I think after that, talk about how we need

53:32.540 --> 53:35.700
to be presenting the idea of socialism,

53:35.700 --> 53:37.900
not as a project of protection,

53:37.900 --> 53:40.340
but as a project of collective empowerment.

53:40.340 --> 53:43.180
So it's not about going to people and saying,

53:43.180 --> 53:45.740
you know, businesses have been mean,

53:45.780 --> 53:48.660
so hand more power to me, a politician,

53:48.660 --> 53:50.180
and I'm going to save you.

53:50.180 --> 53:52.140
Or indeed, politicians have been mean,

53:52.140 --> 53:54.020
hand more power to me, another politician,

53:54.020 --> 53:55.860
and I'll do things differently, right?

53:55.860 --> 54:00.220
It's about demanding that the people who are in charge

54:00.220 --> 54:02.500
actually respect the people that they're supposed

54:02.500 --> 54:05.700
to govern enough to give them the power

54:05.700 --> 54:08.260
to shape the conditions of their lives.

54:08.260 --> 54:10.060
And what does that mean in practice?

54:10.060 --> 54:14.220
It means just halting this extraordinary assault

54:14.220 --> 54:15.300
on the labor movement,

54:15.340 --> 54:18.260
which by the way, the Labor Party is now considering

54:18.260 --> 54:21.580
rowing back on the one little tiny thing it has left,

54:21.580 --> 54:24.140
which is these promises on workers' rights,

54:24.140 --> 54:26.900
which are barely even enough to begin with.

54:26.900 --> 54:31.220
So like really just demanding the end of the assault

54:31.220 --> 54:35.180
on workers' rights and like a strong assertion

54:35.180 --> 54:37.500
of the right to unionize and collective bargaining

54:37.500 --> 54:39.180
and all these sorts of different sorts of things.

54:39.180 --> 54:42.020
That is a key pillar of democracy.

54:42.020 --> 54:43.980
It is about demanding an end

54:43.980 --> 54:47.940
to the astonishingly draconian rules against protest.

54:47.940 --> 54:50.580
We've seen environmentalists being jailed

54:50.580 --> 54:52.820
for trying to bring attention to the fact

54:52.820 --> 54:54.980
that we are destroying the planet.

54:56.140 --> 54:57.540
And we know that the Conservative government

54:57.540 --> 55:01.540
has pushed loads of, they talk about free speech, right?

55:01.540 --> 55:04.260
And like freedom of assembly and all these democratic rights,

55:04.260 --> 55:06.980
and they're just constantly riding roughshod

55:06.980 --> 55:10.100
over just like the most basic democratic principles.

55:10.940 --> 55:15.620
It is about supporting community organizing,

55:15.620 --> 55:18.540
about decentralization and allowing local people

55:18.540 --> 55:21.460
to take power within their local communities.

55:21.460 --> 55:26.460
And it is about also why does spread democratization

55:27.420 --> 55:29.740
of the public sector or our politics?

55:29.740 --> 55:31.700
That means that when we have to think about

55:31.700 --> 55:34.380
how we run our public services,

55:34.380 --> 55:36.900
rather than saying we're going to outsource running

55:36.900 --> 55:39.180
of our health system and social care system

55:39.180 --> 55:41.820
to capita, a giant multinational corporation

55:41.820 --> 55:44.300
that is literally skimming money out of the pockets

55:44.300 --> 55:48.820
of taxpayers and sucking up into those of shareholders.

55:48.820 --> 55:53.260
Why couldn't we have a democratically run

55:53.260 --> 55:57.180
public health care system or public services system?

55:57.180 --> 55:58.420
There's a really interesting example

55:58.420 --> 56:00.460
at the end of the book about Chile.

56:00.460 --> 56:02.340
When Salvador Aende came to power,

56:02.340 --> 56:05.140
and obviously he was just like, you know,

56:05.140 --> 56:06.980
destroyed by the United States

56:07.020 --> 56:09.740
for pushing this model of democratic socialism.

56:09.740 --> 56:12.300
He said he didn't want to go for Soviet style centralization,

56:12.300 --> 56:16.340
nor did he want to go for kind of for capitalism.

56:16.340 --> 56:18.540
And instead he pushed this model

56:18.540 --> 56:19.900
of democratic socialism,

56:19.900 --> 56:21.300
which was extraordinarily popular.

56:21.300 --> 56:25.020
And one pillar of that was how can we organize health care

56:25.020 --> 56:27.980
based on existing community networks

56:27.980 --> 56:32.380
and allowing like workers and patients

56:32.380 --> 56:33.900
and people within that system a voice

56:33.900 --> 56:35.540
as to how they were being treated, right?

56:35.540 --> 56:37.500
There's a completely different model.

56:37.500 --> 56:40.820
It's just, it requires like a complete rethink

56:40.820 --> 56:43.220
as to how we imagine the relationship

56:43.220 --> 56:45.380
between government and governed.

56:45.380 --> 56:48.820
You know, an ideal liberal political philosophy,

56:48.820 --> 56:50.500
government is supposed to be a representation

56:50.500 --> 56:51.660
of our collective power.

56:51.660 --> 56:53.620
It's supposed to be the mechanism

56:53.620 --> 56:54.900
through which we all govern ourselves.

56:54.900 --> 56:56.780
You know, the liberal theorists were like,

56:56.780 --> 56:58.140
we were in the state of nature

56:58.140 --> 56:59.420
and everyone was attacking each other.

56:59.420 --> 57:01.620
So we all came together and decided to form a state.

57:01.620 --> 57:03.500
That's obviously not what happened.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.140
But like arguably the true realization

57:06.140 --> 57:07.860
of the liberal dream is when government

57:07.860 --> 57:10.060
can actually become a mechanism

57:10.060 --> 57:13.060
through which we are all able to govern ourselves collectively

57:13.060 --> 57:14.860
where we come together to make decisions

57:14.860 --> 57:18.660
about the future of our society amongst ourselves

57:18.660 --> 57:21.980
rather than electing people who tell us what to do.

57:21.980 --> 57:23.540
Grace Blakely has been an utter pleasure.

57:23.540 --> 57:24.740
Thank you so much for your time.

57:24.740 --> 57:26.420
Vulture capitalism in all good bookshops.

57:26.420 --> 57:27.260
Thank you.

57:27.260 --> 57:28.100
Thank you.

57:33.500 --> 57:34.340
Thank you.
