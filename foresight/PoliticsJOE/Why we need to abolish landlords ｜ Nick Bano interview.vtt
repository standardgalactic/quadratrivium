WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
a lot of landlords see themselves as good people. They are participating in an immensely harmful

00:05.920 --> 00:10.000
economic system. We've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again. We've got to

00:10.000 --> 00:15.280
rediscover a sense of shame and a sense of direct participation in the harm that we see around us

00:15.280 --> 00:21.040
today. They seem to think that they're entitled to respect and I just feel that like the law is on

00:21.040 --> 00:24.400
their side, economics is on their side, the politicians are on their side, the courts are on

00:24.400 --> 00:29.600
their side. The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them and make them feel ashamed is

00:29.600 --> 00:33.440
laughable. Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism and that's a dangerous place to be in.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.040
Nick Banno, hi, welcome to Politics Show. Thanks so much for having me, great to be here.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.320
Yeah, well thank you for coming. How would you like to introduce yourself?

00:40.320 --> 00:45.760
I am a housing lawyer specialising in legal aid housing work. I've also got a bit of a background

00:45.760 --> 00:50.960
in more street politics kind of things and have an interest in a Marxist understanding of

00:51.760 --> 00:56.160
political economy. Is that the impetus behind this book? Yeah, I just felt like a lot of the

00:56.800 --> 01:01.040
writing we were seeing about housing used some Marxist concepts a bit loosely and I wanted to

01:01.040 --> 01:06.640
get really under the hood of the housing crisis and see how it works from a kind of particularly

01:06.640 --> 01:12.800
Marxist perspective. I could ask you a really, really broad question. In broad terms, what do you

01:12.800 --> 01:21.120
mean by that? By a Marxist perspective. Yeah. Well, classical economists, neoclassical economists

01:21.680 --> 01:28.000
see the role of economics as the allocation of scarce resources and Marx opens capital by saying

01:28.000 --> 01:32.160
we live in a world that has so much stuff in it. There is so many commodities in the world.

01:32.160 --> 01:36.480
How is it that everyone is poor? So he starts from a place of abundance and he tries to work out

01:36.480 --> 01:40.480
what the forces are in the world that make us live lives of misery and struggle in a world

01:40.480 --> 01:44.640
that produces so much and this takes a vaguely similar approach to housing and it says not

01:44.640 --> 01:49.840
only is there so much housing in Britain but there's an awful lot of housing wealth and how is

01:49.920 --> 01:53.520
it that when there's all this money and all these homes, we live in cities that are packed with

01:53.520 --> 01:58.800
gunnels with homes? How is it that all of us living in housing poverty and in very, very bad

01:58.800 --> 02:04.240
conditions? Is that why you've just written for The Guardian about how we don't need more supply?

02:04.240 --> 02:08.560
Yeah, it really touched a nerve that the supply issue is really kind of a throwaway line in the

02:08.560 --> 02:14.320
book. I just have this quick justification of why I'm not talking about supply but I feel that

02:14.320 --> 02:19.440
supply has dominated the discourse for so long that people found it really surprising. A lot of

02:19.440 --> 02:23.760
people found it quite upsetting and shocking that you challenged the accepted wisdom that you kind

02:23.760 --> 02:30.880
of put the property developers to proof that there is this massive shortage because that's not

02:30.880 --> 02:35.360
really what the stats bear out if we look at Britain in historical terms or if we look at the UK

02:35.920 --> 02:41.520
in comparative international terms. But I mean, you know, the short I suppose that accepted

02:41.520 --> 02:46.480
wisdom is because you would think that with more supply that would I suppose liquidate

02:46.480 --> 02:50.640
the market and make the housing stock more affordable? Isn't that not true?

02:50.640 --> 02:55.440
Well, that's the thinking. I think it's difficult to find a great deal of evidence for that.

02:55.440 --> 02:59.840
If it does work like that, then the amount of surplus you'd need to build to have any meaningful

02:59.840 --> 03:04.720
impact on price would be staggering. And given that the planet is dying and given that there are

03:04.720 --> 03:09.920
other ways of doing it, given that we can regulate a housing market out of crisis, then it seems to me

03:09.920 --> 03:17.280
dangerous to obsess ourselves with the idea of supply, to build a vast surplus when we don't

03:17.280 --> 03:21.840
need to, when we can just tweak a few legal and economic levers and get ourselves out of it that

03:21.840 --> 03:28.080
way. Talk to me about regulating the prices down. Yeah, so in most countries and most sensible

03:28.080 --> 03:33.680
places around the world, landlords don't have a complete free reign to work out what they can

03:33.680 --> 03:38.160
extract from tenants without physically killing them. In most places around the world, there's

03:38.160 --> 03:43.520
some sort of cap or break or regulation that governs the way in which rental markets work.

03:43.520 --> 03:47.360
And of course, historically, that was the case here too, but it was completely destroyed

03:48.000 --> 03:55.520
in the late 80s and early 90s. So we're quite unusual in not having any form of rent regulation.

03:55.520 --> 03:59.200
And one of the things that lots of us are campaigning for is to restore it

03:59.200 --> 04:03.920
with the hope that that would restore ourselves to something like a pre-crisis state of affairs.

04:03.920 --> 04:08.160
Because this landmark policy is going to be introduced in Scotland. Yes.

04:08.160 --> 04:13.680
But the accepted wisdom of that down here is that that actually drives up prices.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.640
I don't know if that's the accepted wisdom. I think it's said a lot. I think it's said an awful

04:18.640 --> 04:24.640
lot. And I think it's true that rent controls can be done badly, but that's not a conceptual

04:24.640 --> 04:29.040
problem with rent controls. If it were the case that rent controls were generally bad,

04:29.040 --> 04:31.840
then they would have been abolished in every country in Europe when, of course,

04:31.920 --> 04:36.080
they tend to be present in most European countries where there are problems with

04:36.080 --> 04:39.600
implementing rent controls. They can be fixed. We can make things better.

04:39.600 --> 04:43.920
But the idea that a particular policy is leading to problems and therefore

04:43.920 --> 04:48.640
we just need to let the free market run rampant in Scottish housing is bizarre to me.

04:48.640 --> 04:51.920
I mean, so in layman's terms, feel free to talk to me like an idiot.

04:53.680 --> 04:59.120
If you're going to set a period of time in which rents cannot rise, is that not going to give way

04:59.680 --> 05:02.480
to landlords just pushing up the prices to start with?

05:02.480 --> 05:05.840
It might. But then, of course, that's a short-term pain for a much longer-term

05:06.400 --> 05:11.120
public benefit. And I also think that all of these scarce stories we hear about rent controls

05:11.120 --> 05:14.720
generally paint a picture of a world that's a lot better than the one we're currently living in,

05:14.720 --> 05:18.880
like a lot of these these these healthscapes I would take over the present housing crisis

05:18.880 --> 05:23.280
that so many people are suffering through. Right. What about, I mean, is there not a possibility

05:23.280 --> 05:28.320
as well that, I mean, over the last couple of years, obviously, you know, well, after COVID,

05:28.320 --> 05:34.960
we've seen a sharp rise, a ridiculous rise in rents, particularly in London, in Manchester,

05:34.960 --> 05:40.720
and even actually suburban towns. But is there not a chance that rents are going to come down

05:40.720 --> 05:46.560
by themselves? Well, the class of landlords is not known for being generous and unself-interested.

05:46.560 --> 05:52.000
They're, of course, assisted by letting agents whose only job it is to tell them, look,

05:52.000 --> 05:55.680
this is what we think the market will tolerate. This is what you can get out of this property.

05:55.680 --> 06:01.120
So it would be surprising if landlords acted against their own self-interest by saying,

06:01.120 --> 06:05.920
I'm going to undercut and go below the market rent. So there's a chain then that's driving

06:06.480 --> 06:13.040
rents at the moment? There are structural forces at work. I think when a landlord buys a rental

06:13.040 --> 06:18.800
property, baked into that sale price is the idea that the rent will keep on rising. That's what

06:18.800 --> 06:23.120
makes it valuable to them. So when a landlord says, I'm not going to put the rent up in line with

06:23.120 --> 06:28.640
the market, I'm going to keep it low, that signals or contributes to the idea that it wasn't worth

06:28.640 --> 06:33.120
the purchase price in the first place. It signals or contributes to the idea that the next landlord

06:33.120 --> 06:36.880
who wants to buy it is not making a very good investment because, in fact, the rent it's currently

06:36.880 --> 06:42.560
generating is lower. So there's a structural impetus on landlords to raise the rent. It

06:42.560 --> 06:46.800
justifies the purchase price of their product. It's not just mean people saying, we want to

06:46.800 --> 06:52.960
drive people further into poverty. So going back to what you were talking about before then,

06:52.960 --> 06:59.440
you were talking about how supply is not driving house prices. I mean, is it landlords?

06:59.440 --> 07:05.440
What is the root cause? What is driving? The market's argument is that rents in cities are

07:05.440 --> 07:10.000
what he calls monopoly prices. So it's the highest price that will be tolerated under

07:10.000 --> 07:15.920
given social circumstances without physically driving the class of tenants out of existence.

07:15.920 --> 07:20.080
And what landlords have been doing over the past few decades is realizing and developing their

07:20.160 --> 07:25.680
economic power. And what seems to be happening at the moment is landlords are realizing that

07:25.680 --> 07:31.280
they can just say, do you know what? There is a fee for viewing. And they say it and it becomes

07:31.280 --> 07:35.680
true. It's not that there's suddenly a massive structural adjustment in the number of people

07:35.680 --> 07:40.640
or the number of homes. It's landlords demonstrating the economic power they have over us. They make

07:40.640 --> 07:44.560
a demand, they see if we meet it. And when we do, they say, that is the reality now.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.760
But is that happening all over then?

07:48.960 --> 07:50.080
It's certainly happening in London.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.240
They're charging for viewing or am I sorry, did I just misinterpret that?

07:55.680 --> 07:59.440
I've heard rumors about charging for viewings. I've heard rumors about bidding wars. I've heard

07:59.440 --> 08:04.800
rumors about listed rents not being natural rent you pay. And of course, the more landlords

08:04.800 --> 08:10.400
cotton onto this, the worse the problem becomes. Right. So we're creating a, we're creating our

08:10.400 --> 08:16.240
entomies actually by giving into them. We don't really have a choice. We're not being generous

08:16.240 --> 08:20.560
here. I mean, we really do need places to live. And if this is the demand that landlords make

08:20.560 --> 08:24.080
of us, we don't really have a choice but to say, well, that's what I'll have to do.

08:24.080 --> 08:29.840
Can you talk to me about state backed rent rising? So when you have these short life

08:29.840 --> 08:33.600
tendencies, which dominate the private rented sector, where you have absolutely no security,

08:35.280 --> 08:38.880
landlords are free to demand whatever rent they want. And when the state says,

08:39.520 --> 08:42.960
this is the housing benefit. And by the way, I'm putting housing benefits up.

08:42.960 --> 08:48.000
What the landlords can do is just generate that state spending into additional income for themselves.

08:48.000 --> 08:53.680
They can raise the rents in line with housing benefit rises when there is no cap, when there is

08:53.680 --> 08:58.480
no break. So you have this system where even the best intentioned policies of the state,

08:58.480 --> 09:03.360
which are aims to kind of reduce poverty and to make people's lives easier, are just converted

09:03.360 --> 09:08.480
into higher state spending on landlords, which of course is a massive problem for the tax bill.

09:08.480 --> 09:12.720
And a massive benefit for landlords. So the taxpayer is subsidising landlords.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.840
So the tune of billions of pounds, and it's a number that keeps coming up.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.760
Makes me feel really good that. Yeah, well, you must be a landlord.

09:20.400 --> 09:27.040
No, I mean, just I'm paying twice. Well, exactly. Yeah, exactly. It's the state that's paying.

09:27.040 --> 09:30.080
It's obviously tenants that are paying and it's employers that are paying because obviously

09:30.080 --> 09:34.720
wages in this country have to be sensationally high just so that people can meet their housing costs.

09:34.800 --> 09:39.920
But also with housing benefit, a landlord doesn't have to take a tenant that is on housing benefit.

09:39.920 --> 09:43.920
They can say that certain properties are exempt for some reason.

09:43.920 --> 09:49.360
Well, in principle, they do because it tends to be unlawfully discriminatory to refuse to

09:49.360 --> 09:55.040
take housing benefit tenants. But that tends to take brave and dogged tenants bringing legal

09:55.040 --> 09:59.200
challenges. It's not very good at filtering through into the reality of the world. And we know that

09:59.200 --> 10:04.400
it happens. You know that it happens a lot. But what you do have is the sort of base layer of

10:04.400 --> 10:11.760
housing provision in Britain is met by housing benefit. That's the state kind of underwriting

10:11.760 --> 10:15.280
the bottom of the housing market and everything else is built on top of that.

10:15.280 --> 10:20.160
So as and when housing benefit rises and the lowest rents meet to rise to match those,

10:20.160 --> 10:23.920
the higher up rents rise with it and it's a tide that seems to be lifting all ships.

10:23.920 --> 10:29.040
So housing benefit is driving higher rents? In part, and obviously I'm not saying the state is

10:29.040 --> 10:32.720
bad and the state should cut housing benefit, of course it shouldn't. But I do think it's

10:32.720 --> 10:36.560
interesting to think about the way in which the state is tearing its hair out saying,

10:36.560 --> 10:39.360
what are we going to do about the housing crisis? Well, at the same time,

10:39.360 --> 10:44.160
just having this open checkbook and saying for us landlords can demand what they want and we

10:44.160 --> 10:48.960
will just continue to pay. But what's the simple resolution to that then? Because I mean, when

10:48.960 --> 10:54.560
you talk about supply or, you know, supply not being the answer, if there was a supply of homes

10:54.560 --> 10:59.200
that were owned by the council, is that not a resolution to the housing benefit crisis?

10:59.200 --> 11:03.600
Absolutely. And of course, housing benefit, housing, council tenants are rent capped,

11:03.600 --> 11:08.720
housing tenants are rent controlled, same with social housing providers. If we did that in the

11:08.720 --> 11:13.600
private rented sector, of course, state spending on housing would massively go down. You know,

11:13.600 --> 11:18.640
I'm particularly concerned about the housing that's provided to homeless households, which are often

11:18.640 --> 11:24.240
charged nightly, which are charged utterly exorbitant rates and many, many of them are in

11:24.240 --> 11:28.960
buildings that the council had once built as council housing. So the state's paid for it once

11:28.960 --> 11:33.440
and now it's continuing to pay for it over and over again in the form of private rents.

11:33.440 --> 11:37.280
So this goes back to Margaret Thatcher? A lot of it does. It goes back to Margaret Thatcher and

11:37.280 --> 11:42.320
to Tony Blair, because of course, while it's right to point out that Thatcher dismantled rent

11:42.320 --> 11:47.280
controls, what kept the landlords in check for most of the 20th century was that they were scared

11:47.280 --> 11:52.080
that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords, labor would come and turn it round again. And

11:52.080 --> 11:57.280
when you have a long term investment like land, that tended to keep the landlords at bay a bit.

11:57.280 --> 12:02.080
So when Tony Blair said rent controls are never coming back, I'm keeping what Thatcher has,

12:02.080 --> 12:08.320
that signals to the landlords, you go wild, you go crazy. So what sort of signal is Keir Starmer

12:08.960 --> 12:13.040
sending to landlords at the moment then? If you know, if we take the premise that perhaps he's

12:14.400 --> 12:19.280
well, he's utilizing a bit of Blair? Well, I think he's being curiously quiet. And I think what's

12:19.280 --> 12:23.680
interesting is that he, I mean, he's been outflanked on the Renters Rights Bill. I don't think it's a

12:23.680 --> 12:29.840
policy he himself would have come up with. And he can't do very much better than the bill that

12:29.840 --> 12:35.360
the Tories originally put forward. So he's not saying very much about housing. But what he is,

12:35.360 --> 12:40.880
is nothing extraordinary, nothing remarkable compared to what any other politician is saying.

12:41.840 --> 12:47.120
The Renters Reform Bill, I mean, it has dominated the new cycle, partly because it's

12:47.120 --> 12:51.360
the only policy that is actually being put forward by the Conservatives at the moment.

12:52.160 --> 12:56.960
And a lot of those, the original ideas have been watered down, and they have been relaxed.

12:56.960 --> 13:01.040
But there is one little bit in there about Section 21, I find really interesting. And I was just

13:01.040 --> 13:06.480
wondering, like, what's your interpretation of abolishing Section 21? When I saw the bill,

13:06.480 --> 13:11.760
I thought it was surprisingly good. I think when the Tories were kind of forced into making this

13:11.760 --> 13:17.120
pledge in the 2019 election manifesto, I think they thought it was quite a technical, fluffy,

13:17.200 --> 13:21.840
family-friendly policy. I don't think they quite realized that Section 21 is one of the key

13:23.440 --> 13:28.000
kind of cornerstones of the Thatcherite housing settlement. As I explained a minute ago, it's

13:28.000 --> 13:33.440
what allows landlords to demand a higher rent whenever housing benefit goes up. So when you

13:33.440 --> 13:38.320
abolish Section 21 and introduce that little bit more security, it becomes that much easier

13:38.320 --> 13:41.440
with tenants to say, actually, I'm not paying this higher rent, you're going to have to go

13:41.440 --> 13:46.640
through a legal process to raise it. So it should, it could have the effect of dampening

13:46.640 --> 13:50.480
the kind of runaway pace of rent rises that we're used to seeing.

13:50.480 --> 13:54.000
I think if it is abolished, it'll take some time to bed in because, of course,

13:54.000 --> 13:59.760
it's been abolished in Scotland. And Scotland is still, Scottish tenants are finding their power

13:59.760 --> 14:03.360
and Scottish landlords are realizing the loss of theirs. But those kind of

14:03.360 --> 14:06.560
behavioral changes can take years, if not decades, to bed in.

14:06.560 --> 14:10.560
Well, also, I mean, you know, there's a theoretical loss of power that could be

14:10.560 --> 14:15.200
experienced by the landlord. But, you know, we've just, we've just spoken about housing benefit a

14:15.200 --> 14:20.400
moment ago, and we said that, you know, even though they are landlords, don't take tenants

14:20.400 --> 14:25.200
that, you know, have housing benefits, even though that they are legally required to. So,

14:25.200 --> 14:30.320
I mean, will it actually, you know, will it give power back to tenants, do you think,

14:30.320 --> 14:36.240
in actual practice? Because how many young people, especially in today's market, have the time

14:36.880 --> 14:39.920
or the know-how to take a landlord to court?

14:39.920 --> 14:44.080
Yeah. And of course, that's going to be the challenge that the housing movement faces.

14:44.080 --> 14:48.560
It's going to be re-skilling a generation of renters as to their rights. But I do think it's

14:48.560 --> 14:53.040
going to be crucial in terms of the number of people who don't complain to their landlords

14:53.040 --> 14:59.440
about housing conditions because of section 21. It suddenly gives them a much safer environment

14:59.440 --> 15:04.080
to do that, to say, you know, I pay you money for this service, you've got to fix the boiler,

15:04.080 --> 15:05.520
you've got to fix the damp.

15:05.520 --> 15:10.400
That's really interesting about not complaining, because it's true, isn't it? Most tenants don't

15:11.200 --> 15:14.160
don't speak up because they are worried that they're going to be evicted.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.920
I mean, I think it's true for all of us. I think we've all experienced it. And I think one of the

15:17.920 --> 15:23.200
really weird and amazing things about the housing market here is that if your landlord comes round

15:23.200 --> 15:26.960
and says, oh, there's a bit of a damp problem, I'm going to do something about that,

15:26.960 --> 15:31.040
you genuinely don't know whether that's the landlord behaving themselves or the landlord

15:31.040 --> 15:36.800
gearing up to evict you. So even if you have a nice landlord, you live under such a looming threat

15:36.800 --> 15:41.920
that it wreaks havoc with people's sense of stability and their mental health and their

15:41.920 --> 15:44.880
capacity to build their lives. It's a horrible situation.

15:45.520 --> 15:49.280
Landlords don't really do too well with being told that they have to, you know,

15:49.280 --> 15:55.040
with more regulations being slapped on them. I mean, a couple of years ago, we were talking about,

15:55.040 --> 15:59.600
actually might have been last year, we were talking about energy efficiency and how all

15:59.600 --> 16:05.360
properties now had to be energy efficient. You know, you couldn't have a single glazing or a

16:05.360 --> 16:11.600
roof that allowed heat to evaporate. How did that increased regulation go down?

16:12.160 --> 16:17.520
Well, yeah, it wasn't popular. And it's really interesting because I think a few years ago,

16:17.520 --> 16:23.200
it would have been seen as something of a fringe issue. But with the massive rise in energy bills,

16:23.200 --> 16:27.520
the energy performance of people's homes is life changing financial decisions.

16:27.520 --> 16:32.400
And it's only fair that landlords should, the ones who benefit from the housing crisis,

16:32.400 --> 16:38.160
should be the ones who ensure that tenants aren't losing money, not only by paying their rent,

16:38.160 --> 16:43.040
but by paying extortionate energy bills for leaky flats and poor energy performance.

16:43.040 --> 16:49.440
But of course, if you add on these costs to landlords, costs that many would argue are actually

16:49.440 --> 16:57.440
just, you know, basic provisions that make somewhere livable, landlords apparently decide

16:57.440 --> 17:02.160
that they don't want to rent their homes out anymore. So what's the solution to that?

17:02.160 --> 17:06.960
Well, this is, I mean, I sort of take them at their word. And this is exactly what happened in

17:06.960 --> 17:12.960
the previous century, that where it became unprofitable to be a landlord, they sold up.

17:12.960 --> 17:16.560
And that was generally seemed to be a good thing, because it means more owner occupiers.

17:17.200 --> 17:23.520
It means more ability for local authorities to buy properties and repurpose them or redevelop

17:23.520 --> 17:27.840
them as council tenancies. And it just means people like more people living in better forms of

17:27.840 --> 17:30.800
tenure than the private rented sector, which is by far the worst.

17:31.360 --> 17:34.640
Do you think that councils would want to repurchase private property?

17:34.640 --> 17:39.600
We know that they did. We know that they spent a lot of the 70s and 80s doing exactly that.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.760
Of course, things are a bit different now. But I mean, local politicians fall over themselves to

17:43.760 --> 17:48.080
promise more social housing. And if they were having to, if landlords were having to sell up

17:48.080 --> 17:52.160
at bargain basement prices, it's a good opportunity for local authorities.

17:52.160 --> 17:57.040
There's quite an interesting Lib Dem policy that came out a couple of months ago. That's

17:57.040 --> 18:03.360
something that you don't hear very often, but that they wanted to devolve planning permission.

18:03.360 --> 18:09.760
So they wanted to give local areas more opportunity to decide what is in their local area.

18:10.560 --> 18:16.720
Do you think that councils would be able to purchase private property and make it into

18:16.720 --> 18:22.480
social housing if local people were able to decide what those properties were going to be used for?

18:22.480 --> 18:26.720
I mean, to be fair, in the last century, the way it worked was massive amounts of government

18:26.720 --> 18:32.240
grants and public and public money. If the government was interested in doing that, then

18:32.240 --> 18:37.040
I think they would probably have to fund it or at least change the way in which local authorities

18:37.040 --> 18:41.680
can access public loans. But we know it can be done if there's a political will for it,

18:41.680 --> 18:46.640
because it happened 50 years ago. Do you think that there is a political will for it or will

18:46.640 --> 18:52.160
there be understarm? I know you said that he hasn't spoken much about housing, but can you imagine it

18:52.160 --> 18:56.800
would be quite high up the agenda? I really hope that things will start to change. I really hope

18:56.800 --> 19:03.200
that we start to remember the old wisdom that we had throughout the 20th century in terms of what's

19:03.200 --> 19:11.200
called municipalisation, buying property of distressed landlords. I don't know if it will happen,

19:11.200 --> 19:17.040
but what I think is hopeful is that we're now starting to remember, to have these conversations

19:17.040 --> 19:22.640
again about how grubby and harmful the business of landlordism is, about how we have it within our

19:22.640 --> 19:29.200
grasp to take property away from them and repurpose it if we really want to. It encourages me that

19:29.200 --> 19:32.720
this is suddenly a hot topic. This is something we're beginning to talk about again.

19:32.720 --> 19:37.760
I know you'll probably ask this all the time, but for the sake of the tape, can you explain to me

19:37.760 --> 19:44.640
what you mean by the grubby business of landlords? I think a lot of landlords see themselves as good

19:44.640 --> 19:50.640
people, and I'm sure they probably are, but they are participating in an immensely harmful

19:51.440 --> 19:57.200
economic system. They are profiting from an immensely harmful system, and the way I think of

19:57.200 --> 20:02.560
it is it's a bit like people who use their phones while they're driving. Everyone seems to think

20:02.560 --> 20:07.680
they have some particular and unique excuse, but when you think about it statistically at a social

20:07.680 --> 20:14.320
level, we know that it's immensely dangerous, and anyone who is a landlord is not just profiting

20:14.400 --> 20:19.760
they're profiting three times. They're getting the rental income, they're getting their mortgage

20:19.760 --> 20:24.000
paid off, and they're getting capital gains. Even those landlords who think, well, I could be

20:24.000 --> 20:29.920
charging more, they're doing extraordinarily well, and they're doing extraordinarily well

20:29.920 --> 20:36.560
to everybody else's loss. It's really interesting, that phone analogy. Do you think landlords are

20:36.560 --> 20:42.640
all landlording? Is it rooted in individualism? It is here, and that's a weird thing about Britain,

20:42.960 --> 20:48.320
is that almost all of our landlords are just individual people. I think, again,

20:48.320 --> 20:52.880
the old wisdom is worth discovering here, because throughout the 20th century, the landlord was

20:52.880 --> 20:58.400
this figure of scorn, this really hated, reviled character, and there was a massive and deliberate

20:58.400 --> 21:03.200
social change under Thatcher and Under Blair to reinvent the landlord instead of being this kind

21:03.200 --> 21:12.480
of often violent, always unpalatable character, to be this sort of state-sanctioned, petty investor

21:12.720 --> 21:18.720
and acceptable topic for the dinner table. And I think if we want to be serious about

21:18.720 --> 21:23.200
reversing the housing crisis, we've got to make it embarrassing to be a landlord again. We've

21:23.200 --> 21:28.880
got to rediscover a sense of shame and a sense of direct participation in the harm that we see

21:28.880 --> 21:33.920
around us today. I've heard jokes before that landlords used to be hung out of windows.

21:36.240 --> 21:39.840
I don't like... Not physically, sorry, by their feet, just to be clear.

21:39.840 --> 21:45.280
Yeah, well, more often it was landlords doing the violence. I'm not a fan of kind of chauvinist

21:45.280 --> 21:53.040
language around landlords. I think it can lead to some nasty things. I do think

21:54.080 --> 21:58.560
I do think they ought to be embarrassed. I do think they ought to be ridiculed. It really

21:58.560 --> 22:05.280
fascinates me that whenever there is sort of a protest or a direct action about a landlord,

22:05.280 --> 22:10.800
they seem to think that they're entitled to respect. And I just feel that the law is on their

22:10.800 --> 22:14.800
side, economics is on their side, the politicians are on their side, the courts are on their side.

22:14.800 --> 22:19.680
The idea that we shouldn't mock them and humiliate them and make them feel ashamed is laughable.

22:20.320 --> 22:24.400
Why do you think all of those... Well, all of those that you've just listed,

22:24.400 --> 22:29.760
why are they on the side of landlords? Well, we're in a dangerous situation where

22:29.760 --> 22:34.960
the argument of the book is that the housing market more broadly is rooted in profitable

22:34.960 --> 22:40.720
landlordism. What generates the vast house prices is the idea that if you're selling your house,

22:40.720 --> 22:45.440
you have to sell it to someone who may or may not be a landlord. So anyone buying it would have to

22:45.440 --> 22:51.120
at least compete with a landlord who's able to command these extravagant rents. So the

22:51.120 --> 22:56.640
rented sector is intimately tied in to the housing market more broadly. The government really,

22:56.640 --> 23:02.720
really, really can't have the housing market failed because it's destroyed a system of pensions,

23:02.720 --> 23:07.440
it's destroyed a system of social care, it's presided over a system of wage restraint,

23:07.440 --> 23:12.960
and house prices for an awful lot of people are the only kind of stability they have,

23:12.960 --> 23:18.400
the only kind of economic well-being they have. So a direct attack on landlordism is a much

23:18.400 --> 23:23.760
broader attack on the housing economy more broadly. So it's dangerous territory to be in.

23:23.760 --> 23:28.160
And I think if you don't want to be cynical about it and simply say, oh, well,

23:29.280 --> 23:33.120
the MPs are all landlords and they're all in each other's pockets, if you want to be more

23:33.120 --> 23:39.600
generous than the interpretation is, they know that Britain's wealth is rooted in landlordism,

23:39.600 --> 23:44.720
and that's a dangerous place to be in. But that's really interesting because then as the number of

23:44.720 --> 23:52.160
renters grow every single year, you've created a two-tier society there. You've got an asset

23:52.160 --> 23:56.400
class who are able to, what you're talking about, you know, social care, adult social care,

23:56.400 --> 23:59.360
they're going to be able to fund that, they're going to have a pension in that, then you're going

23:59.360 --> 24:04.640
to have an entire cohort of people who physically can't do it. Is that not going to be more expensive

24:04.640 --> 24:08.400
for the state in the long term? Not only can they not do it, but of course they're paying for the

24:08.400 --> 24:13.120
social care of their landlords and then property owners. It is something of a zero-sum game and

24:13.120 --> 24:18.160
it's right that the bigger this phenomenon of landlordism becomes, the more people the state

24:18.160 --> 24:24.960
is going to have to look after. The irony being, of course, they dismantled that system in the

24:24.960 --> 24:29.760
first place and replaced it with one of property rights and it's coming back to bite them.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.160
That feels like the state has gotten larger then.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.680
The housing benefit bill certainly got larger. What the state is doing with its money seems to

24:37.680 --> 24:42.720
be a lot less. It seems like so much money is just averted straight from taxes to

24:43.360 --> 24:45.360
other people's mortgages, not the people's pockets.

24:46.320 --> 24:50.880
When we look at councils and the number of councils that are going bankrupt at the moment,

24:50.880 --> 24:55.200
how much of that do you think is linked to the increased pressures that they're facing with

24:55.200 --> 24:59.600
housing? Well, the councils themselves are being incredibly honest about that and saying we can't

24:59.600 --> 25:05.280
afford to house our homeless populations, we can't afford to meet the temporary accommodation costs we

25:05.280 --> 25:11.520
have, and we can't afford to replenish our social housing stocks. Housing and social care is obviously

25:11.520 --> 25:16.960
one of the biggest items of local authority spending. It blows my mind that if we wanted to,

25:16.960 --> 25:21.200
we could just sort that out with rent controls and we choose not to. We choose to let local

25:21.200 --> 25:24.960
authorities go bust instead. I just want to go back to a bit of the theory that you've got in

25:24.960 --> 25:30.320
the book. You talk about Karl Marx and Adam Smith and you link them and you say that both of them

25:30.320 --> 25:33.520
would not like the current housing system that we have. Can you tell me why?

25:34.000 --> 25:40.400
Well, Marx and Smith both argued and it's traditionally been true on the right that

25:40.400 --> 25:45.920
landlordism is not a good thing. It's not a profitable economic activity. It's a pure drag

25:46.640 --> 25:53.120
on social production. It's taking away wealth that was created by other people.

25:54.160 --> 26:00.000
That was a wisdom that held true for a very long time and I think we've mentioned in the 1970s,

26:00.000 --> 26:04.720
this kind of very relaxed attitude towards the collapse of the private rented sector.

26:04.720 --> 26:11.520
And it's us who are living in this really weird political moment where the right supports landlords.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.400
You would think that the right would be interested in lower state spending and you would think that

26:16.400 --> 26:23.040
they would be interested in lower wage bills and successful businesses. Instead, they seem to

26:23.040 --> 26:30.800
be very interested in property development, fine, but that seems to be intimately tied

26:30.800 --> 26:35.360
up with landlordism as well. So they find themselves coming out to bat for landlords

26:35.360 --> 26:39.680
in the name of property development, but that carries with it the idea that the state should

26:39.680 --> 26:45.200
carry on spending all this money on housing benefit, diverting all of his tax and these wages

26:45.200 --> 26:51.200
to the already wealthy. To make a crass argument off the back of that, you could say I didn't think

26:51.200 --> 26:55.360
that the right liked benefits grounders. There you go. Exactly. Which is what you're essentially

26:55.360 --> 26:59.520
saying that they are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yes, the entire housing benefit bill

27:00.480 --> 27:04.240
that goes to the private sector is your right, a form of benefits grounding.

27:04.240 --> 27:11.520
It's extraordinary. We touched on Margaret Thatcher earlier. Can you tell me how important

27:11.520 --> 27:16.960
right to buy was in creating some of the issues that we have now? Yeah, I think it's really sad.

27:16.960 --> 27:22.480
I think if I happen to be running a nice local authority and I wanted to build council housing,

27:22.480 --> 27:27.040
I probably wouldn't bother because we saw this week the news that this beautiful,

27:27.040 --> 27:32.160
a war-winning scheme in Norwich, an awful lot of it has been sold off under the right to buy within

27:32.160 --> 27:37.920
three years of its life. And what is the earthly point of investing massive amount of public resources

27:37.920 --> 27:45.280
in a social generational good if it's going to disappear and be repurposed as a sort of private

27:45.280 --> 27:51.200
gain within years of its existence? And you have this idea that the state's already paid full of

27:51.200 --> 27:56.400
this stuff once. It's built it. It's built it as a social good. And it's now paying for it again

27:56.400 --> 28:01.840
in the form of repurposed right to buy flats, being re-letters, private, often temporary

28:01.840 --> 28:07.200
accommodation at extortionate rates. So what do you do about that? Do you get rid of right to buy?

28:07.200 --> 28:09.920
Would you have never done the scheme in the first place? I don't think abolishing right to buy

28:09.920 --> 28:13.680
should be remotely controversial. I don't think it's controversial in Scotland where it's already

28:13.680 --> 28:19.360
happened. It's a real, like, fringe demand to keep right to buy in place, or at least it should be.

28:19.360 --> 28:23.760
You know, you should be embarrassed to stand up and say, I think public assets should be sold off

28:23.760 --> 28:27.840
in perpetuity and that the state pay for them over and over again in the form of rents.

28:28.400 --> 28:32.480
You see, you don't hear it from that side of it too often because it's normally a very

28:32.480 --> 28:40.240
emotive argument, you know, that a man has a right to own his own home. And it's always

28:40.240 --> 28:44.400
sold as a sort of like, you know, it's actually sort of as a bit of a fairytale actually.

28:45.520 --> 28:50.560
What should we change sort of like our whole relationship with how we view houses and how

28:50.560 --> 28:56.000
we view ownership? Well, I think the idea of selling off right to buy for emotional reasons is a

28:56.000 --> 29:00.960
nice idea if you can afford it. But I mean, both parties keep telling us that there isn't a magic

29:00.960 --> 29:08.000
money tree. They can't afford to keep right to buy in place. Can we talk a little bit about the

29:08.000 --> 29:12.720
legislation in Europe? I love talking about legislation. Well, do you know, actually,

29:12.720 --> 29:17.920
they like hearing about legislation and talking about the sort of things that sort of regulations

29:17.920 --> 29:23.040
in Europe or legislation that you would be in favour of implementing here? Yeah, again, it's

29:23.040 --> 29:27.200
worth pointing out just how weird Britain is. I mean, you go to almost any city in Europe.

29:27.840 --> 29:33.440
They have more or less some form of rent control. Some are weaker, some are stronger. The rent

29:33.440 --> 29:37.200
controls that exist in Ireland aren't particularly strong. The rent controls that exist in Germany

29:37.200 --> 29:43.280
are much stronger. But we're in this very, very weird place where we don't have any limit on how

29:43.280 --> 29:49.200
much landlords can try to extract from tenants. So I'm not, for the time being, I'm not hugely

29:49.200 --> 29:53.280
fussed about what we steal, what we borrow and what we implement here, as long as we do something,

29:53.280 --> 29:58.800
we can improve it in the future. But take any system you want and bring it here or restore

29:58.800 --> 30:01.760
the one that we had here that works so well for the best part of the 20th century.

30:02.000 --> 30:07.840
What would be your, if you had one pick, one bit of legislation that you could implement tomorrow

30:07.840 --> 30:12.960
that even ported in from Europe, what would it be? Well, it has to be some form of rent control.

30:13.600 --> 30:19.280
It is a broad social good. It makes people's lives less miserable. It makes people's lives

30:19.280 --> 30:23.200
more affordable. The only people that doesn't benefit is landlords. And I think we can all

30:23.200 --> 30:26.960
agree that's that we're comfortable with that. Would you get rid of landlording if you could?

30:27.920 --> 30:33.040
You know, it's not a case of abolishing it. You can't pass the Landlord Abolition Act 2024,

30:33.040 --> 30:35.360
but what you can do... I don't think you're thinking big enough.

30:36.960 --> 30:40.880
The point is that the state works in more discreet ways, but it can abolish landlords and

30:40.880 --> 30:44.560
it does abolish landlords. And that was the really interesting point about the 70s was that

30:46.240 --> 30:51.760
landlords weren't just declining and they weren't just dwindling, but the scale at which they were

30:51.760 --> 30:56.560
dwindling was accelerating. And that was to do with state policy. That was to do with high

30:56.560 --> 31:01.200
interest rates and rent controls, which meant that it was just simply a bad idea to be a landlord.

31:01.200 --> 31:07.520
You couldn't make any money doing it. So you de-incentivise it as an economic activity.

31:07.520 --> 31:11.760
Smith would disagree that it is an economic activity, but however you do it, the state

31:11.760 --> 31:16.800
through its policies can generate a system in which landlordism fails. And I think that would

31:16.800 --> 31:20.640
be a good thing. I know you touched upon it earlier, but do you think there is a way to be

31:20.640 --> 31:33.200
an ethical landlord? No. I think... Under current circumstances, it's not possible.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.880
Even if you're letting below the market rent, you're still charging some of the

31:38.880 --> 31:44.480
highest rental prices in Europe. You could effectively treat yourself as a local authority

31:44.480 --> 31:49.680
and grant a legally secure tenancy. But the point I mentioned a moment ago that even the

31:49.680 --> 31:54.000
landlord who comes trying to fix the mold, the tenant doesn't necessarily know. The tenant would

31:54.000 --> 31:58.240
have to take them at their word. And when the landlord has the absolute right to evict you for

31:58.240 --> 32:03.760
any reason or none, they can paint themselves as generously as they'd like. But ultimately,

32:04.400 --> 32:08.400
they have immense power over the tenant and they could choose to wield it or not. And that's not

32:08.400 --> 32:15.920
a healthy situation to be in. How do we get back to the 70s style of landlording that you're in

32:15.920 --> 32:22.640
favour of without increasing supply? Well, I think that the 70s style of landlording was

32:22.640 --> 32:25.920
very bad. I mean, they were awful landlords, but the point was that they were much fewer often.

32:26.560 --> 32:32.880
Far, far fewer people were being subjected to the harm of the private rented sector. It's not

32:32.880 --> 32:38.960
difficult to replicate the system of laws that was in place in the 1970s. And of course, when you

32:38.960 --> 32:44.320
depress land values, you make it much, much easier for local authorities to build social housing.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.080
The biggest barrier they face at the moment, as well as the looming right to buy threat,

32:48.080 --> 32:51.680
is how do we get hold of land and how do we build on it? Because at the moment,

32:51.680 --> 32:54.720
they're competing with Barrett homes, they're competing with

32:56.400 --> 33:00.640
the people who are destroying elephant and castle lendlies. And local authorities just

33:00.640 --> 33:06.960
don't have the purchasing power. Whereas if you make that kind of speculative price-increasing

33:07.680 --> 33:11.920
redevelopment unprofitable, suddenly the local authorities the biggest player in town.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.320
I mean, a lot of those big housing companies that you just spoke about there,

33:16.320 --> 33:20.400
a lot of the time, if you speak to anyone who works high up there,

33:20.400 --> 33:24.160
they actually say their work is very unprofitable. They say that their margins are very slim.

33:24.160 --> 33:28.320
And I'm sure that's true. I'm sure that's true. And it shows just how easy it would be to drive

33:28.320 --> 33:35.840
them out of business if we wanted to. Looking ahead, I mean, there's been a sharp increase in

33:35.840 --> 33:42.560
the number of millennials who are renting. But millennials are also expected to be, well,

33:43.200 --> 33:48.560
well, they will be part of the asset class quite soon, actually. Can you imagine that

33:49.440 --> 33:53.760
those millennials, do you think that they would have been turned off of landlording

33:53.760 --> 33:58.160
from their own experience? Or do you think that, I don't know, maybe the human condition doesn't

33:58.160 --> 34:05.760
there? I take your point. I think that depends an awful lot on the mood music that we create.

34:06.000 --> 34:12.720
As a society, I think the way part of the way in which landlordism was made acceptable was by these

34:13.280 --> 34:18.240
TV programs that were just endlessly on in the 2000s about about playing the property game

34:18.240 --> 34:24.560
and how gentle they made it look, how acceptable they made it look. And if we rediscover a sense

34:24.560 --> 34:31.840
of refulsion, if we replace those with TV programs about just how horrible it feels when you don't

34:31.840 --> 34:37.440
know if the landlord is going to kick you out or fix the mold for your own benefit, I would hope

34:37.440 --> 34:44.240
that people take that sense of shame on board and choose not to. But fundamentally,

34:46.160 --> 34:50.880
I wouldn't like there to be a situation in which it's the choice of that generation. I would prefer

34:50.880 --> 34:54.400
to create the conditions in which it isn't profitable for them to be landlords, in which it

34:54.400 --> 34:59.200
makes no sense for them to be landlords, and that they should sell up either to someone who's going

34:59.200 --> 35:03.520
to live in the house themselves or to someone who's going to do something more socially productive

35:03.520 --> 35:07.520
with it, like repurpose it as social housing. It's become quite popular again. It's not just

35:07.520 --> 35:12.960
those early 2000s programs, but it's popular again on social media. Yeah, I think it never

35:12.960 --> 35:17.200
really went away. And some of them, they're just really bleak to watch. I think the original

35:17.200 --> 35:20.960
dream of these programs was that you looked around your dream home and everyone felt good about it,

35:20.960 --> 35:24.480
but now the host says, oh, what are you going to do with it? And they say, I'll just put a coat of

35:24.480 --> 35:28.320
paint on it and let it out. And the fact that you can go on TV and say that without,

35:29.280 --> 35:33.360
without feeling an enormous sense of shame is a very unhealthy sign.

35:33.360 --> 35:37.840
Yeah. I mean, even on, I mean, I think I was watching something on TikTok just the other day.

35:37.840 --> 35:43.280
It was a girl who must have been about 28. She was explaining how you could make a home into an HMO.

35:43.280 --> 35:53.520
Yeah. Yeah. It's revolting. And when we had what was called the Rackman scandal in this country,

35:54.480 --> 36:00.800
this scandal of violent thuggery in the private rented sector, there was a kind of moment of

36:00.800 --> 36:04.880
national shame around the idea of landlordism. And one of the biggest landlords at the time

36:04.880 --> 36:09.760
was the church, which sold off an awful lot of its stock because it didn't like the aesthetic of

36:09.760 --> 36:14.160
being a landlord. So again, these are all things that we have done in the past. It's well within

36:14.160 --> 36:18.000
our grasp to do it again. People should be ashamed to make TikToks and say, this is how you make an

36:18.000 --> 36:23.120
HMO. Through shame. The church sold it off through shame. Well, it was embarrassing. It was, it was

36:23.120 --> 36:28.960
also unprofitable. But for a variety of factors, the church, yet massively decreased its private,

36:28.960 --> 36:34.720
private landlord practice. How realistic is that ambition going to be in, well, either of our,

36:35.760 --> 36:42.240
well, near lifetimes? I think, I think it really is up to us. I think your right to point out that

36:42.240 --> 36:46.960
the millennial experience is very different. And the generation below us is very different. And I

36:46.960 --> 36:54.880
think there is a culmination of a sense of unfairness and rage. Because what the economic

36:54.880 --> 37:01.520
purpose that our generation has served is to take all of our income and pass it on to already wealthy,

37:02.080 --> 37:09.680
older people. And at a certain point, that the anger at that situation begins to dominate at a

37:09.680 --> 37:14.080
certain point, the foolishness of that situation begins to dominate. And I don't think it's out

37:14.080 --> 37:20.240
of the realm of possibility that, you know, as people who are in their 30s become, you know,

37:20.240 --> 37:25.520
the ones who are running the Labour Party and important in government, the common sense,

37:25.520 --> 37:29.200
there's a sudden outbreak of common sense. And everyone says, this is a stupid system.

37:29.200 --> 37:32.720
It's plagued me my entire life. I will not have it plagued the next generation.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.840
So you're hopeful for it? Yeah. And I think the renters unions are being so good at the moment.

37:37.840 --> 37:45.040
I think housing campaigns are being so good at the moment, and capturing that nascent

37:46.160 --> 37:52.240
resistance, that sense of this is wrong, and purposing it towards landlords. So I think

37:52.240 --> 37:56.960
the energy is there, and the will is there, all we need to do is sort of consolidate it,

37:56.960 --> 38:01.840
make sure it's pointed at the right people. And yeah, I would be very surprised if we come back

38:01.840 --> 38:06.320
here in five years time, and we say, well, we've just kept the system of landlordism going. We've

38:06.320 --> 38:10.320
done nothing to address it. I mean, even the Conservative Party is passing a renters reform

38:10.320 --> 38:15.120
bill. Well, there's even quite a strong Conservative group as well. I think it's priced out. It's

38:15.120 --> 38:19.520
called, isn't it? Yeah. They're not, they're not fans of me, and I'm not a fan of them.

38:19.520 --> 38:25.360
Oh, no. Why? Is it the Marxism? It's the Marxism. It's the, I mean, what, what they do is they kind

38:25.360 --> 38:30.240
of confect this debate about Yimbees and Yimbees. They say it's all to do with supply. And if you

38:30.240 --> 38:35.680
are not a property development type, then you want to make the housing crisis worse. And it's

38:35.680 --> 38:39.760
very effective with discourse. It's very effective at backing people into a corner and saying, well,

38:39.760 --> 38:44.160
I'm a good guy. So I must be a Yimbe. And I just think this is a false argument to have.

38:45.280 --> 38:49.760
They won over a lot of politicians. They won over a lot of influential people. But I think what I

38:49.760 --> 38:55.120
would encourage your viewers to do is to question their logic, question their rhetoric, question

38:55.120 --> 39:00.080
their data, and say, can you really convince me that there's a supply problem? Or do we solve the

39:00.080 --> 39:04.560
housing crisis by the methods that were successful in the 20th century through regulation, through

39:04.640 --> 39:08.720
rent controls, and through making landlords is a less profitable activity.

39:09.280 --> 39:14.320
But I mean, is there any hope of anyone in the Conservative Party introducing more legislation,

39:14.320 --> 39:22.320
more regulation? You know, it's historically true that Conservatives haven't like landlords,

39:22.320 --> 39:26.800
as you pointed out, I don't think it's beyond the realm of possibility that Tories will say,

39:26.800 --> 39:32.640
that's enough state spending on landlords now. Let's try and unwind it.

39:32.640 --> 39:39.040
That's the sell. I can see that. Yeah, I think that and wage bills. But of course,

39:40.080 --> 39:44.800
landlordism is so wrapped up with home ownership that at the moment, the bigger concern in their

39:44.800 --> 39:49.120
mind is keeping home ownership going. And they seem to be willing to spend enormous amounts of

39:49.120 --> 39:53.280
public money in the form of housing benefits to make sure that the home ownership system remains

39:53.280 --> 39:56.400
in place. Thank you very much for coming in. It's been a real pleasure.
