1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
The neoliberal shift wasn't actually about shrinking the state.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,720
What it was about was about crushing collective power.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,440
The physical assertion of the power of the state,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,200
that was the literal beating up of miners,

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
the use of the police to put them in their place.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,080
But there was this ideological shift as well,

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,000
which was you are not a worker, you are not a citizen,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,360
you are a consumer.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,920
This toxic individualism that has become so pervasive

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,640
within our society has allowed our political class

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,080
to basically get away with murder.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,760
We need to be presenting the idea of socialism,

13
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,960
not as a project of protection,

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
but as a project of collective empowerment.

15
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,920
Grace Blakely, hello.

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,920
Hi. How's it going?

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,920
Good thanks, how are you?

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,760
Very well. Very glad to have you here in the Polish Institute.

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,880
Lovely to be here.

20
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,560
Yes, great to have you here.

21
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,240
We're talking because of this weighty tone,

22
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,880
vulture capitalism, corporate crimes,

23
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,720
backdoor bailouts and the death of freedom,

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,880
a lot of substance which we're going to get into.

25
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm glad you think so.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:56,960
Did you enjoy it?

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,800
I did. Good.

28
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,880
But first, for those who don't know who you are,

29
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,680
how would you like to introduce yourself?

30
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,920
So I'm Grace Blakely.

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,680
I am a writer.

32
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,880
I write about political economy.

33
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,400
This is my latest book.

34
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,160
I've also got a very well and all good bookstores.

35
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,480
I'm also a staff writer for Tribune Magazine.

36
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,720
And I do bits and pieces in the media.

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,840
Nice. Okay.

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,440
In that subheading there, Death of Freedom,

39
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,160
I think that's the bit that stands out to me most

40
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,880
and is sort of recurrent throughout, right,

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,120
this loss of freedom or a lack of it under capitalism.

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,440
So can you start us off there?

43
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,360
Why is it that we're not free in our capitalist system?

44
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,880
I'm really glad that that kind of came through

45
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,040
as the central message of the book

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,560
because that is really where I wanted to start.

47
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,200
I think we are fed this line that we live

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,760
in this free market democratic system, right?

49
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,000
And that that's what capitalism is.

50
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,520
Capitalism means free markets and democracy.

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,520
And the kind of incursion of the state into the economy

52
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,240
limits freedom and creates this problem of big government.

53
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,720
And that results in this kind of dichotomized politics

54
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
that we have at the moment,

55
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,680
where it's basically just a debate

56
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,880
between some people saying, we need more market,

57
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,120
less government and other people saying,

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,240
we need like more government, less market.

59
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,920
And I just think that that kind of divide

60
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,640
is so just sterile and unhelpful.

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,080
And this really came through, I think,

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,040
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

63
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
So I started writing this book,

64
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,040
which just come out of the 2019 election defeat

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,720
and went straight into everything

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,560
that was going on around COVID.

67
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,720
And I started being asked like on mainstream TV questions

68
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,400
like, oh, well, the government's spending loads of money.

69
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,560
This is basically Corbanism.

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,480
This is what you wanted.

71
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,200
You've got what you campaigned for.

72
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,680
And I started to realize that people had,

73
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,920
there was just this amazing,

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,840
astonishing misunderstanding

75
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,200
as to what capitalism actually is

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,280
and what socialism is.

77
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,400
People thought that capitalism meant free markets

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
and the state not doing anything,

79
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,680
despite the fact that actually existing capitalism everywhere

80
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,160
has a very, very active role for the state.

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,000
That spending that was taking place during COVID,

82
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,240
it was basically the government funneling money

83
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,720
into massive corporations to landlords

84
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,520
into the financial system.

85
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,600
And somehow we're led to believe that that is socialism,

86
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,440
that the government propping up big business is socialism.

87
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,120
So I kind of wanted to cut through that divide

88
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,120
and say like, you know, this state versus market thing,

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,080
it doesn't really work.

90
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,280
It rests on this distinction between politics and economics.

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,440
It doesn't really stand up in practice.

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,760
You know, most of the time the state is acting

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,600
to defend the interests of big business

94
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,640
and big businesses working within the state

95
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,040
and alongside the state to do what it wants to do.

96
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,200
So how can we understand what like a kind of progressive

97
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,720
liberatory politics actually means in that context?

98
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,160
And for me, this always comes back to the dirty word, Marxism.

99
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,120
I think, you know, there's so much misunderstanding

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,080
as to what that means as well.

101
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,920
And I kind of start the book by looking at these two quotes.

102
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,280
One is from Marx, which is about him saying, you know,

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,600
the worker is treated as a kind of a bee under capitalism

104
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,760
where they just kind of follow orders

105
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,080
and kind of buzz around the hive.

106
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,640
Whereas actually they're architects.

107
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,440
They learn to kind of create,

108
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,120
they kind of yearn to create worlds in their head

109
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,360
and bring those into being with their hands.

110
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,000
And I contrast that with the kind of the quote from this free market,

111
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,960
the kind of darling of the neoliberals, Hayek,

112
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,440
who basically says, freedom of thought

113
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
is only of relevance to a small minority.

114
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,160
And it's him and actually even Keynes

115
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,000
and most of the big thinkers that we hold up in our political debate,

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,760
they basically all believe,

117
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,720
whether they're on the center left or the center right,

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,920
that the vast majority of people

119
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,600
should not be given the power to govern themselves

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,720
because they're too stupid or they're too impulsive

121
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,800
or they don't understand the stakes of the decisions that they're making.

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,760
Whereas for me, the fundamental insight of Marxism

123
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,480
is that the only way we get to liberation,

124
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,560
the only way we get to a fair and just society

125
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,400
is when people take power,

126
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,320
when they take power within their workplaces and their communities

127
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,840
over political life as a whole,

128
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,440
because politicians aren't going to listen to you if you don't demand it.

129
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
You know, corporations certainly aren't going to behave themselves

130
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,080
if you don't like force them to.

131
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,120
It's really up to us to actually begin to kind of build the society

132
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
that we want from the ground up.

133
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,480
A risk of asking an absurdly broad question,

134
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,760
but seeing as you just said it there about this kind of mischaracterization

135
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,880
of what Marxism means,

136
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,880
what does Marxism mean to you?

137
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,080
I know you spoke about it a little bit there,

138
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,720
but maybe could you try and put some truth to that sort of ism,

139
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,600
if you like, that style of thought, that method of political analysis?

140
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,520
Yeah, totally.

141
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,120
So as a kind of way of understanding capitalism,

142
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,800
it's, as you say, a kind of mode of analysis

143
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,960
that begins by looking at the way that we produce things as a society.

144
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,400
So rather than say, looking at the prevailing ideas within a society

145
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,640
and saying history is driven forward by these great battles

146
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,680
between different groups of ideologies or different sets of ideas,

147
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,240
Marxism says most of what happens within our society

148
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,720
is shaped by the conditions in which things are produced.

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,440
And the insight about capitalism is a social system

150
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,920
that rests upon the fact that some people own all the things

151
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,400
that we need to produce things,

152
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,000
and there's this big class of people who cannot survive

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,400
other than by selling their labour power for a living.

154
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,960
So just as an example, you know, there's a difference between capitalism,

155
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,480
this social system based on the production of commodities,

156
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,720
class-based system based on the production of commodities,

157
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,200
and feudalism, which is the system that revolves around land,

158
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,400
where you have an aristocracy that's in charge.

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,280
And again, this is about how things are produced,

160
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,360
like the political dynamics of feudalism come back

161
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,880
to the fact that a small class owns all the land

162
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,160
and the peasants have to work it to get what they need to subsist.

163
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,080
In the same way, the insight of Marxism is that it's this class-divided society

164
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,120
oriented around the production of commodities,

165
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,040
which is sold for profit,

166
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,000
and that that is undertaken through this class division,

167
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,480
this social division of labour,

168
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,760
where basically working people,

169
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,600
the people who are forced to sell their labour power,

170
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,680
are exploited by the ones who own things,

171
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
because they own the stuff that everyone else needs

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,040
just to be able to live.

173
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,480
And it's from that that you then begin to understand

174
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,120
the dynamics that I highlight in the book.

175
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,800
Because, you know, the other way of looking at capitalism

176
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,880
is, as I've said, that it's a system based on, you know,

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,040
private property and free markets, basically.

178
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,320
And then you have these ideas that only human freedom

179
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,880
can be protected by free markets,

180
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
and free markets are the only systems that lead to kind of democracy

181
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,240
and respect for human rights and all those different sorts of things.

182
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,280
That's the kind of lie that we're told about the way capitalism works.

183
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,360
But if you start from this perspective of seeing capitalism

184
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,240
as this system that's basically on class domination,

185
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,560
then things start to make a little bit more sense,

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,120
because we don't actually have free markets.

187
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,880
You know, there's lots of examples in this book

188
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,120
where I show that most of the major industries

189
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,600
within the world's economy are dominated by one or two firms

190
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,360
that are deeply corrupt and, like, in the pockets of politicians

191
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,440
and vice versa.

192
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
So I start with the example of Boeing, right,

193
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,160
which has been in the news recently for the doors blowing off its planes

194
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,200
at, you know, about 13,000 feet in the air.

195
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,920
This comes on the back of these crashes that took place several years ago now,

196
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,760
where over 350 people died in two separate crashes

197
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,640
where Boeing planes just nose-dived out of the air.

198
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,440
I won't give you all the gory details,

199
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,320
but suffice to say, people are Boeing knew about the flaws in this plane

200
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,880
before it was put on the market.

201
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,800
They deleted references to the system

202
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
that caused the problem in the pilot manual.

203
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,200
They didn't tell anyone what was going on.

204
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,720
These concerns weren't raised when the planes did crash.

205
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,440
They tried to blame the pilots.

206
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,960
The FAA, the regulator, basically did nothing.

207
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,360
And throughout all of this, the American state

208
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,000
was channeling billions of dollars' worth of tax cuts

209
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,560
and subsidies into Boeing.

210
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
And I think what that shows is that this argument that, you know,

211
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,040
let's say this problem with Boeing, right,

212
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,600
it shows that the market doesn't work

213
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,440
and we need to hand more power to the government.

214
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,760
Well, actually, the government was just as involved with this

215
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,640
as the executives at Boeing.

216
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,640
And it's because capitalism is this system

217
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,960
where everything is oriented around making sure

218
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,200
that the people who are in control of the production process

219
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,440
basically get what they want, right?

220
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
And so the only way to push back against that

221
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,920
isn't to say, let's give more power to politicians,

222
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,360
because, you know, half the time they're in the pockets of these guys,

223
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,360
is actually to say, how do we pull power down?

224
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,800
So how could workers within Boeing

225
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,680
have organized to resist both their exploitation

226
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,360
and the kind of corruption of this company?

227
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,080
And there's another example in the book

228
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,920
I look out of the Lucas Plan, where workers in an aerospace

229
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,000
company in the UK did just that.

230
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,760
They kind of organized to try and take control of the firm.

231
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,360
The audio recordings between the pilots union and Boeing

232
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,280
are extraordinary to listen to.

233
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,640
Yes.

234
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,920
OK, I was going to ask you about planned economies, which

235
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
are typically associated with communism.

236
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,800
But seeing as you mentioned feudalism,

237
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,120
I just want to at risk of taking this on a tangent already,

238
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,160
but why not?

239
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,200
We had Janice Verifakis in here a couple of months ago

240
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
talking about techno feudalism, right?

241
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,760
And this idea that actually we're past capitalism now,

242
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,720
and what our modern economic model actually far more closely

243
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
resembles feudalism than a lot of people would like to believe,

244
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,960
that these sort of cloud capital, these huge companies,

245
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,800
these huge corporations are actually, in a way,

246
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,280
modern feudal lords.

247
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,520
What do you make of that argument?

248
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,080
I don't know if you read the book and I appreciate it.

249
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,240
Yeah, I have.

250
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,000
I really like Janice.

251
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,240
I interviewed him for his book launch, actually,

252
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,760
a couple of months ago.

253
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,760
And I agree with a lot of his analysis,

254
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,720
but I think we come at it from different perspectives.

255
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,960
Because whilst a lot of the stuff that he writes about

256
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,080
in terms of the detail and the analysis as to what's

257
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,000
happening with the economy, I totally agree with.

258
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,520
I just think that that is part of capitalism.

259
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,960
And you see a lot of this stuff in progressive economics,

260
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,240
where you get critiques of the way that the economy works

261
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,240
from people who say, well, this isn't real capitalism.

262
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,320
They say, for example, the dominance of finance

263
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,080
means actually that you've got these monopolistic banks

264
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,680
sucking rents out of the economy,

265
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,320
as though they are the modern examples of feudal lords.

266
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,040
Or you've got too much concentrated corporate power.

267
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,840
That means we don't have free markets, so it's not capitalism.

268
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,280
And again, I come back to this point

269
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,800
that capitalism does not mean free markets.

270
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,680
Those two things are not the same.

271
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,160
Markets are an important part of the way

272
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,480
that capitalism functions.

273
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,800
They're a very important ideological part

274
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,040
of the way capitalism functions.

275
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,240
You have to believe that you're competing

276
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,080
against other people in this market for your labor.

277
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,000
Otherwise, the system loses legitimacy.

278
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,280
But the actual functioning of production

279
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,840
in the capitalist system centers far more

280
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,360
on stuff that happens within massive monopolistic

281
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,680
corporations than it does on the interactions that

282
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,920
take place in the market.

283
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,800
And this isn't a new thing.

284
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,280
In the book I go back to just like the example

285
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,960
of the East India Company, where

286
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,800
this was like this massive joint venture

287
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,480
between some wealthy and powerful people who

288
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,600
gained the right to create this big corporate entity

289
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,280
and the British state in pursuit of imperial power.

290
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,080
And that's another part of the book, which is that this nexus

291
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,720
of power that we see at the level of the domestic economy,

292
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,400
the kind of fusion of state and corporate power,

293
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,120
is often projected over the whole world economy

294
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,160
in the form of imperial power.

295
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,080
And yeah, this was a big part of the development

296
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,720
of British capitalism, the East India Company.

297
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,560
Adam Smith called it a strange absurdity.

298
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,360
He said it was a state in the disguise of a merchant.

299
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,760
And all the kind of original theorists of capitalism

300
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,280
were like, this doesn't really make sense.

301
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,880
This doesn't fit within the way that we think about capitalism.

302
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,320
But it was companies like the East India Company

303
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,480
and the AIC itself were central to the development

304
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,240
of the capitalist system across the world.

305
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,560
So there isn't this clean distinction

306
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:55,160
between corporate power and kind of free market capitalism.

307
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,480
Those two things go hand in hand.

308
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,480
The Anarchy by William Dalrymple is a really interesting study

309
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,480
on the East India Company.

310
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,000
He's great.

311
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,520
I've forgotten the name of it now,

312
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,160
but there's a method of system analysis,

313
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,640
which basically says if you want to understand

314
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,320
the intention of a system, you don't look at how it was designed.

315
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,280
You just look at the outcomes.

316
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,400
And so if you look at capitalism and you say,

317
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,320
well, modern capitalism is defined by financialization,

318
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,120
by the extraction of economic rent,

319
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,360
then it actually doesn't particularly matter

320
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,200
if that was never the intention.

321
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
If that's what it is now,

322
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,800
then actually that's one of the defining characteristics of it.

323
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,440
Yeah, no, completely.

324
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,320
And I think you can start by looking at the outcomes,

325
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
of course, and that is important.

326
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,120
And saying that capitalism kind of isn't working

327
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,960
in the way it's supposed to.

328
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,920
It kind of harkens back to people who are like,

329
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,360
oh, well, the like state socialism practice in the USSR

330
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,720
isn't real state socialism.

331
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,760
And yeah, I mean, I think that that was state socialism

332
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,400
and it's different to democratic socialism,

333
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,880
which is what I'm arguing for.

334
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,680
But it's kind of a bit of a,

335
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,520
it's kind of a non-argument, isn't it really?

336
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:00,160
It's like capitalism could be this nice, lovely,

337
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,000
fluffy, wonderful thing,

338
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,160
but it's just not working

339
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,840
because it's being kind of corrupted by people at the top.

340
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,560
And often this actually veers into like

341
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,200
anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, right?

342
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,760
Because people say, oh, capitalism is this lovely system,

343
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,240
but it's being corrupted by kind of evil financiers

344
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,080
or, you know, weird kind of lizard people or whatever.

345
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,600
I'm not up to date with all the latest conspiracy theories.

346
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,320
Not up to date, not up to date.

347
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,080
I think that one's still floating around.

348
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
There's some great YouTube videos

349
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,360
where like there's like a glitch or something

350
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,920
of like a royal and people like that was him shaped.

351
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,520
He's just taken from his lizard form into the human world.

352
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,120
I'm glad you mentioned the USSR, right?

353
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,080
Because you would typically associate planned economies

354
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,400
with those communist authoritarian states.

355
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,640
But you argue in the book, right,

356
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,440
that actually capitalist economies

357
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,520
are quite closely resembled right, a planned economy.

358
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,560
So who's doing the planning?

359
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,480
How does it work?

360
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,400
Talk us through it.

361
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,240
That is great.

362
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,360
That was nearly an exact quote from my book

363
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
when I say something like,

364
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,240
what's important isn't the presence or absence of planning.

365
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,360
It's who's doing the planning?

366
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,880
How is it being undertaken and in whose interests?

367
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,200
And I think that's really important because, yeah,

368
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,960
so, you know, just for clarity,

369
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,120
I'm not saying that there's no difference

370
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,760
between a state socialist and a capitalist economy.

371
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,920
Obviously there is.

372
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,840
But I suppose what I'm arguing is that there is this scale

373
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,800
along which you can chart most modern economies.

374
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,040
You can place most modern economies on the scale

375
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,040
between kind of pure anarchy and pure centralized control.

376
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,280
But actually the important thing to note

377
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,320
as well is that that scale has maybe at least two axes, right?

378
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,040
One of them concerns state planning and centralized control

379
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,880
and the other one concerns corporate planning

380
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,560
and centralized control.

381
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,560
So you could have, you know,

382
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,360
private corporate planning and state centralized control.

383
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,760
So like the USSR, obviously,

384
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,680
there was like an immense amount of centralized control

385
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,720
by the state over the economy.

386
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,160
Bear in mind that that centralized planning

387
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,840
was never total and it never can be.

388
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,320
You know, you never have a purely planned economy.

389
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,000
You never have a purely anarchic economy.

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,320
It's very important to remember

391
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,600
economies are always these kind of complex systems.

392
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,200
They never, and this is kind of again,

393
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,440
an insight from systems theory,

394
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,760
which Hayek, the famous neoliberal economist,

395
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,600
really liked.

396
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,960
The reason that he said that centralized planning

397
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:13,360
would always kind of create all these unintended consequences

398
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,160
because you can't ever completely control

399
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,680
a system as complex as an economy,

400
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
as complex as a society.

401
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,080
At the same time, those systems never collapse

402
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
into complete anarchy.

403
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,120
There's always some order.

404
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,400
There's always some stability that emerges

405
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,720
within those systems.

406
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,520
So economies operate in this, on the spectrum

407
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:35,520
between anarchy and centralized coordination and control.

408
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,240
And you see this today if you look at, for example,

409
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,800
like Chinese state capitalism.

410
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,240
The Chinese economy is a capitalist economy.

411
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,680
It's oriented around the production of commodities

412
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,880
for sale and for profit.

413
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,800
And that is an incredibly centralized economy

414
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,880
where you have both the states

415
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,160
and extremely powerful corporations

416
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,000
that have an immense amount of control

417
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,880
over people's daily lives.

418
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,480
At the same time, the state in the US is also,

419
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,280
in some ways, fairly similar

420
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,840
because you have an immense amount of corporate control

421
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,920
over people's daily lives.

422
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,120
You have some of the largest and most powerful corporations

423
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,440
on the planet that are centered in the US.

424
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,160
They have, a lot of them have kind of

425
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,520
monopolistic control over their markets.

426
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,880
They have what's called kind of monopsony power

427
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,680
in the labor market, which means that they're able

428
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,120
to kind of control the market for labor.

429
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,040
They have immense lobbying power.

430
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,200
They kind of shape what happens within the state

431
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,840
at both the kind of federal level and a more local level.

432
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,440
They have kind of this immense ecological power

433
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,520
to shape the future of our relationship with the climate.

434
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,880
And they have the power to avoid and evade tax,

435
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,880
to promulgate laws, to break the law with impunity.

436
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,080
There's this massive issue of kind of corporate impunity

437
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,520
where you have basically corporations allowed

438
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,280
to break the law without any sanction whatsoever.

439
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,200
And all of this power is exercised, as I said,

440
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,680
with very little accountability

441
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:10,040
because these institutions have so much power within the state.

442
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,040
So, you know, we like to think of the divide, as I've said,

443
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,920
within our politics as one between kind of, you know,

444
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,640
centrally planned socialist economies on the one hand,

445
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,880
like we had in the USSR,

446
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
and then these lovely free market democratic

447
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,080
capitalist economies on the other hand,

448
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,360
and the US is supposed to be an exemplar of that.

449
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,680
But actually, if you take the kind of big superpowers

450
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,280
that we've seen in the world economy

451
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,720
over the last kind of hundred years,

452
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,920
the USSR, the US, and China,

453
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,160
all of them share in common this immense centralisation

454
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,080
of power at the centre among this core of, you know,

455
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,120
state apparatchiks, heads of major companies,

456
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,680
heads of major financial institutions.

457
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,640
And all of them share this problem.

458
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,560
Or, you know, if you're an elite, this positive element,

459
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,360
which is that the vast majority of people

460
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:03,360
have no real control over what happens in their daily lives.

461
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
They feel as though they have no power.

462
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,880
Now, of course, what I argue in the book is that we do have power.

463
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,200
If we are able to organise and resist the power

464
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,880
that has exerted upon society by these institutions,

465
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,480
then we can begin to change things.

466
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,120
But the world in which we live

467
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,520
is one in which we're told,

468
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,320
you, as an isolated individual, have no power up against this system

469
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,680
that is basically kind of all-encompassing.

470
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,560
Even as you're told, oh, you do have the power

471
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,640
to kind of decide what you want to consume

472
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
and decide who you want to vote for.

473
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,240
And, you know, you're in this, like, free market system

474
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,160
where you're completely free to make those micro-decisions

475
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,280
on a daily basis.

476
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,080
And yet the whole structure of the society in which you live

477
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,640
has already been decided by someone else.

478
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,200
And as a voter, as a consumer,

479
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,520
you have very little influence

480
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
over how those decisions are made.

481
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,720
I really want to drill into that feeling of powerlessness.

482
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,160
I think it's so relevant, you know, that...

483
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,200
call it capitalist realism,

484
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,680
call it a feeling of powerlessness, I don't know,

485
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,400
an omwi and apathy that essentially are an ability

486
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,920
to imagine an alternative.

487
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,200
Even though, as you write and as others have written as well,

488
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,400
there are alternatives.

489
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
There are, at risk of sounding like,

490
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
slightly sincere at earnest, like joyful alternatives, right,

491
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,880
where people can find self-expression,

492
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,800
self-realisation, self-actualisation.

493
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,560
But it's almost one of the defining characteristics

494
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,400
of the system, right, is its ability to drum out, reduce,

495
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,120
minimalise any idea or possibility of conceiving

496
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,800
of something alternative than what we currently have.

497
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:39,560
Yeah, and I think this problem actually comes down

498
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,280
to something that's shifted with the transition

499
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,800
towards neoliberalism.

500
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,560
So I argue in the book, right, the neoliberals,

501
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,000
the shift that we had in the 1980s with Thatcher, with Reagan,

502
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,880
this idea that we needed kind of privatisation,

503
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,560
free markets, a shrinking of the state,

504
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,560
none of those, like the shrinking of the state

505
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,960
didn't actually happen.

506
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,280
Those were all kind of ideological justifications

507
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,760
for what was actually just a massive reassertion

508
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,320
of the power of a big business, a finance, et cetera,

509
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,200
and a crushing of the power of working people,

510
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,280
particularly the labour movement.

511
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,800
But you had these narratives that were like,

512
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,080
we need privatisation, we need deregulation,

513
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:19,160
and that's going to deliver free markets,

514
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,680
and promote personal freedom and autonomy, basically.

515
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,280
In fact, what we've seen is, in many ways,

516
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,760
a kind of expansion of the power of the state,

517
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,200
and an expansion of corporate power alongside that.

518
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Often we see kind of state power wielded

519
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,840
through the private sector as well.

520
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,920
I use some examples in the book, like G4S,

521
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,880
McKinsey, these kind of like quasi-public institutions

522
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,400
that are often charged with just astonishing corruption

523
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
or mismanagement or fraud or whatever.

524
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,160
And they just get away with it, sorry?

525
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,160
Macquarie's probably a pretty good example.

526
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,080
Yeah, exactly.

527
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,160
And they just get away with it because they're just so close

528
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,280
to these public institutions.

529
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,720
So the neoliberal shift wasn't actually

530
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,920
about shrinking the state.

531
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,920
What it was about was about crushing collective power.

532
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,520
And you see this with the first moves

533
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,920
that politicians like Bertrand Reagan undertake

534
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,760
when they come into power.

535
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,000
It was crush the labour movement.

536
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,960
And there was a discourse that surrounded this as well.

537
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,040
There was the physical assertion of the power of the state.

538
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,800
That was the literal beating up of miners,

539
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,560
the use of the police to put them in their place.

540
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,640
But there was this ideological shift as well,

541
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,600
which was you are not a worker, you are not a citizen,

542
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,600
you are a consumer, you are an entrepreneur of the self.

543
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,320
And a lot of neoliberal policies were designed to push this.

544
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,280
It was like, we will allow you to buy your own house.

545
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
We will privatise your pension.

546
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
You will be able to take out loads of debt.

547
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,040
Your life will become this balance sheet

548
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:51,400
of assets and liabilities and it's up to you to manage that.

549
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,960
If you manage it well, you will do well and you will succeed.

550
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,400
If you manage it badly, you will fail

551
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,160
and that will be entirely your own fault.

552
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,680
And even things like the privatisation of education.

553
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:05,000
Education becomes an investment in your human capital

554
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,880
and it's up to you to undertake that investment

555
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,520
and to make the best of it.

556
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:13,520
So you see this ideological decimation

557
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,760
of the collective consciousness

558
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,480
that was really the foundation of the post-war consensus.

559
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,800
And it's replacement with this rampant toxic individualism.

560
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,560
And I actually think that a lot of the problems

561
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,280
that we have in our society today,

562
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
whether it's like the crazy stuff that you see

563
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,960
on social media, whether it's this sense of powerlessness,

564
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,200
whether it's even like low pay as a result

565
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,680
of people not being able to organise,

566
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:42,680
they all come back to this question of individualism.

567
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,640
And you hear this, particularly among young people,

568
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,040
there's a sense that when things go wrong,

569
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,120
it's your own fault.

570
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,840
You have no one to blame but yourself.

571
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,240
And I think this is really like damaging people's mental health.

572
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,000
There's this sense of like deep and profound shame

573
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,360
at not being able to compete in the same way

574
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,320
as maybe those around you.

575
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,600
I think this feeds the rise of the far right.

576
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,440
I think young men who feel that they are unable

577
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,160
to kind of portray the kind of alpha characteristics

578
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,880
that are associated with like elite men,

579
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,000
get this sense of like resentment and anger

580
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,920
that they then kind of take out on the system as a whole.

581
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,520
And this again comes down to this idea

582
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,080
of like competitive individualism.

583
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,800
It is up to you to compete and do well.

584
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,640
And if you can't do that,

585
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,240
then you're a loser and a failure.

586
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,160
And all of this comes back to this shift

587
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,600
that was at the heart of neoliberalism,

588
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,640
which is that there's no such thing as society,

589
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,920
which is what Thatcher said,

590
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,880
it's all just a collection of isolated individuals

591
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,520
competing against each other.

592
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,920
And I mean, to illustrate what this means

593
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,440
for our sense of our own power within the system.

594
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,640
Think about like 50, 60 years ago,

595
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,880
if you as a worker were dissatisfied with your pay,

596
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,680
or you went home and you couldn't put food on the table,

597
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,600
you would have gone into your workplace,

598
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,680
chatted with your coworkers,

599
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,800
chatted with your union rep and said,

600
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,960
look, are you in the same position as me?

601
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,400
Cause I can't afford to feed my kids.

602
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
And they would have been like, yeah, you're right.

603
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,520
Okay, well, we need to do something about this.

604
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,800
We need to go and strike and organize

605
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,520
because our boss is exploiting us.

606
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,360
Today, if you can't put food on the table,

607
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,200
what do you do?

608
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,440
You blame yourself.

609
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,320
You maybe go out and get a personal loan,

610
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,760
a very high interest rate.

611
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
Some people become depressed

612
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,800
because they're like, I can't afford to feed my family.

613
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,640
I'm a loser.

614
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,640
There's no sense of your, you know, collective power

615
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,360
or indeed the way in which you are being exploited

616
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,120
because of your position within the system.

617
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,240
It's all, it's my fault, right?

618
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,880
Or sometimes it's their fault, right?

619
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
It's scroungers or immigrants or whatever.

620
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,160
It's like some problem over there.

621
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,920
And that I think is really what is preventing us

622
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,120
from being able to resist.

623
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,040
Because if people did have this greater sense

624
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,080
of like collective agency, then, you know,

625
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
we would have stronger unions.

626
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,240
People would be organizing in their workplaces

627
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,840
to demand higher wages.

628
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,800
We would have tenants unions, right?

629
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,120
People wouldn't be so easy to exploit

630
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,320
within the private rented sector.

631
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,240
And we do have those, but they would be stronger.

632
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,880
People would be pouring out onto the streets saying,

633
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,200
you know, we cannot afford to heat our homes.

634
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,320
This is a failure of our political class.

635
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,120
But instead, it's I'm a failure.

636
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,260
I have to use a food bank, right?

637
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,400
This like toxic individualism

638
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,040
that has become so pervasive within our society

639
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,560
has allowed our political class

640
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,320
to basically get away with murder.

641
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,960
Because instead of blaming them,

642
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,760
we all blame ourselves or we blame each other.

643
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,920
And that is I think the most profound ideological shift

644
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,280
that we've seen under neoliberalism.

645
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,400
I'm so glad you mentioned that

646
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,760
in the context of mental health.

647
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Because I think one of the most damaging instances

648
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,920
of this sort of toxic individualism

649
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,520
and sort of high perseverance of the individual

650
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,240
is in sort of wellness, right?

651
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,840
It's like rather than engaging with a systemic analysis

652
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,880
of like, why do I feel anxious and depressed?

653
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,840
Maybe it's because I don't have secure housing.

654
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,200
Maybe it's because I'm low paid.

655
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,200
Maybe it's because I'm burdened with personal debt.

656
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,720
And instead it's work on yourself, set boundaries.

657
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,280
Do you actually maybe need to cut some people out of your life?

658
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,800
Like, what are you talking about?

659
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,800
Can you talk a little bit more about the role

660
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,760
that financial institutions played

661
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,880
in that sort of expansion of neoliberalism,

662
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,720
particularly in that sort of thatcherite 80s Britain?

663
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,240
Yeah, totally.

664
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,080
Yeah, I think that example of mental health

665
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,400
is really good, right?

666
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,200
And I want to say, you wouldn't see this

667
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,520
when it comes to people's physical health, right?

668
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,560
You wouldn't be like, oh, you know,

669
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,200
it's your fault that you've got lung cancer

670
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,200
because, I don't know, you're not looking after yourself.

671
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,080
You're not taking your daily turmeric or whatever.

672
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,560
But actually you do now see that, right?

673
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,720
It's like instances of illnesses that result

674
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,280
from social issues like air pollution

675
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,880
or not having adequate diet or whatever,

676
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,760
increasingly are being blamed on individual people.

677
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,200
So you're seeing this become more and more pervasive

678
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,880
in every area of society.

679
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,000
And there's obviously an ideological dimension here

680
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,520
as we've just discussed.

681
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,280
But again, coming back to this idea of what is Marxism,

682
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,880
we trace back things that happen in the realm of ideas

683
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,320
to things that happen in the realm of production,

684
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,040
in the economy or in politics or whatever.

685
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,080
We don't just say, oh, suddenly everyone changed their minds

686
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,280
or there was a really powerful ideological movement

687
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,600
that made everyone change their minds.

688
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,160
Those things are important

689
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,040
and these movements are spearheaded

690
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,200
by powerful groups of people who make these arguments

691
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
in the public sphere.

692
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,320
I wouldn't be out here talking to you

693
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,520
if I didn't think ideas were important.

694
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,600
But I do also think that a lot of the big shifts

695
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,920
that we see can be traced back

696
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,920
to what happens in politics and economics, basically.

697
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,160
And in the 80s, you did see this big shift towards

698
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:51,480
the creation of the kind of individual investor entrepreneur,

699
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,560
the mini capitalist, basically.

700
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:59,560
And that was a very self-conscious shift

701
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,120
that was functional both politically

702
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,840
and to the kind of economic transition

703
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,880
that we saw during the 80s.

704
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,360
So the reason it was functional politically

705
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,280
is what we've already heard, right?

706
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,720
If you replace a sense of collective agency

707
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:16,360
among people who are part of the working class

708
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,960
with this individualized sense of agency

709
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,640
that's like, I own my house, I have my own pension,

710
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,720
I care more about what the stock market is doing

711
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,160
than the average wage share of national income

712
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,000
because my pension's invested in that.

713
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,320
I care about what's going on in the housing market.

714
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,640
And I know that basically the more freedom we give the banks,

715
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,720
the better my pension will do

716
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,760
and the better my house will do.

717
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,400
So that political shift is great for the conservative party

718
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
and ultimately forces the Labour Party

719
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,480
to kind of adapt and shift its position

720
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,200
to accommodate neoliberalism as well.

721
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,640
And you get this neoliberal consensus

722
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,360
among all the major political parties.

723
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,520
But there is, as you mentioned,

724
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,120
this kind of economic underpinning to it as well.

725
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,120
And yeah, those shifts become functional

726
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,080
to basically the financialization of the economy as well.

727
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,240
I don't want to kind of get too into the nitty-gritty of this,

728
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,840
but things like pensions privatization, right?

729
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,320
It adds to this massive pool of capital

730
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,080
that can be played around with by the financial sector

731
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,040
by these huge asset managers

732
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,920
that we now have, institutions like BlackRock, for example,

733
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,040
which I write about in the book.

734
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,560
It's this institution that controls

735
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,280
other people's money, basically,

736
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,360
and is invested in most companies,

737
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,640
most large companies in the world,

738
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,840
just because it has indices that track

739
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,600
what goes on in the stock market.

740
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,480
And you have basically, as a result of that investment power,

741
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,720
the head of BlackRock is able to write

742
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,360
to the corporations that BlackRock has invested in,

743
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,280
which is basically every large corporation on earth

744
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,120
and say, we think you should do this,

745
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,000
we think you should do that, right?

746
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,640
That is not the way that a free market is supposed to function.

747
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,000
A free market is supposed to be lots of little individual people

748
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,160
putting their money into a pot,

749
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,200
and then the money goes to the most profitable firms

750
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,760
because that's how the market works.

751
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,760
It's not like these huge behemoths

752
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,840
that are basically able to direct and plan

753
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,400
what happens within markets.

754
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,080
That's kind of contrary to how we're told

755
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,960
capitalism is supposed to work.

756
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,760
So that kind of shift towards financialization

757
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,040
was really facilitated by, yeah,

758
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,560
things like pension privatization.

759
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,280
And obviously, the long boom of the 1990s,

760
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,400
which had, I mean, it's just,

761
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:31,400
it's difficult to begin to kind of categorize the shift

762
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,560
that that moved towards the kind of

763
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,280
home-owning democracy had on our politics

764
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,400
and our economics, right?

765
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,520
If you think about that, like the long 1990s

766
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,880
from the end of the first housing market crash

767
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,720
and kind of like the early 1990s,

768
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,400
when house prices just skyrocketed

769
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,160
because you had the complete unleashing

770
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,680
of the power of finance, everyone could get a mortgage.

771
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,800
It seemed like there was just this endless pool of money

772
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,200
that was circulating around the world economy.

773
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,640
People did buy their houses often on the cheap,

774
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,840
through right to buy.

775
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:07,000
You suddenly created this class of asset owners

776
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,160
who were much more identified with house prices

777
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,080
and the performance of the stock market

778
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,960
than they were anything else.

779
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,440
You had just this, you know,

780
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,480
astonishing wave of globalization as well

781
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,160
that happened throughout the global economy.

782
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,000
And there was this like incredible optimism

783
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,440
that was among the kind of the capitalist class

784
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,120
at this point that Gordon Brown said,

785
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,880
we've ended boom and bust.

786
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,400
There were all these economists saying,

787
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,600
we're gonna liberate the poor world.

788
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,160
You know, the former communist countries

789
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,160
are gonna become, you know, these free market utopias.

790
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,640
But like up to 2007,

791
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,960
just the kind of millenarian like optimism

792
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,120
of those who were supporting this

793
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,480
like neoliberal financialized shift was,

794
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,040
it was hard to argue against, right?

795
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,000
Even for those on the left,

796
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,880
there was the sense that, yeah, you know, fine,

797
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,440
capitalism's kind of won.

798
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,000
Like what can we really do other than like-

799
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,840
And history.

800
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,960
Exactly, yeah.

801
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,400
And then you get the financial crisis

802
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:07,520
and you realize that all of that was just based on

803
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,040
not only a kind of lie, a political lie,

804
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,840
but also just deeply unsustainable economics.

805
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,760
And a politics which has really just like torn apart

806
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,800
the fabric of our society.

807
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,120
And we're living with the result of that now.

808
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,200
We're living with the result of the kind of the arrogance

809
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,760
of the ideologues of capital during their heyday.

810
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,640
And yet, because they were so successful

811
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,720
in like shattering our sense of collective agency

812
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,280
and our ability to imagine a different world,

813
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,960
we haven't moved beyond that.

814
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,480
And it's just kind of like people fiddling around the edges

815
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,160
being like, how do we get back to before the financial crisis

816
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,200
without the acknowledgement that there is no going back?

817
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,520
So to get beyond that then,

818
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,240
and I'm struck again by our use of the word sort of power,

819
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,000
right, in relation to this sort of untrammeled

820
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,200
financialization and in the face of that,

821
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,840
you know, these ginormous corporations,

822
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,160
these ginormous financial institutions,

823
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,120
we have individualized sort of atomized, fractured people

824
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,120
in our society.

825
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,840
So how effective is something like trade union organization?

826
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,920
How effective is something like an expanding

827
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,960
sort of collective consciousness in combating

828
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,880
and dealing with those forces?

829
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,400
Because, I don't know, I look at Port Talbot, right?

830
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,080
Thousands of job losses for the steel workers there.

831
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,840
And it connects to what we're talking about, right?

832
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,320
Because it's not just a job loss.

833
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,920
It is literally like the community,

834
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,880
the sense of sort of collective pride place,

835
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,960
yeah, sense of home almost,

836
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,960
and that collapsing has deep, deep ramifications.

837
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,240
So in a sentence, sort of how effective is trade union

838
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,240
organization or similar mechanisms

839
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,560
in confronting these incredibly powerful institutions?

840
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,720
I think the problem that we have with organizing today

841
00:34:55,720 --> 00:35:00,080
is that even collective institutions have been,

842
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,280
you know, paralyzed by this sense of individualism.

843
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,280
They've kind of been infected by individualism.

844
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:11,960
So if you go back to, I write in, again, in the book

845
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,520
about the example of the Lukas plan.

846
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,640
So, you know, contrast what happened at Boeing,

847
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,360
or, you know, indeed what happened at Port Talbot

848
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,640
with the example of the workers

849
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,800
at Lukas Aerospace in the 1970s.

850
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,080
Their plan, well, their company was kind of under threat

851
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,960
from rising competition from abroad.

852
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,920
They appealed to the then labor government

853
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,320
saying, we want you to nationalize us.

854
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,520
And Tony Bend and their minister for trade and industry

855
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,240
replied and said, we can't do that right now.

856
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,720
You guys need to come up with a plan

857
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,440
as to how you can save this firm yourself.

858
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,120
And Ben was, again, one of these big believers

859
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,840
in democratic socialism.

860
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,240
And so the workers were like, right, okay, what do we do?

861
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,560
And the union representatives basically surveyed

862
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,480
all of the workers at Lukas Aerospace

863
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,560
and said, what do you think we should do?

864
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,680
How could we transform the operation

865
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,520
of this largely weapons manufacturer, basically?

866
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,120
And the workers came back and they said,

867
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,680
we need to transform this institution

868
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,440
into a worker owned, democratically run organization

869
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,280
that produces socially useful commodities,

870
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,600
not weapons, basically.

871
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,840
And they put together this document called the Lukas Plan,

872
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,600
which was just probably one of the most radical documents

873
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,080
in Britain's economic history.

874
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,320
It comprised ideas that had been put forward

875
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,520
by workers from throughout Lukas Aerospace

876
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,760
to use the tools and the skills

877
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,800
that were then available to them

878
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,400
to transition from the production of weapons

879
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,080
to things like kidney dialysis machines, wind turbines,

880
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,040
things that would be useful for society.

881
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,800
And at the same time, these workers had said,

882
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
this is how we'll manage ourselves.

883
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,920
This will be the ownership structure of the organization.

884
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,640
This is the way that we'll transition

885
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,960
to this new way of working.

886
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,760
It was this incredible business plan, basically,

887
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,760
that totally undermined the spirit of capitalism,

888
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,200
which is that the owners own the firm,

889
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,080
the managers manage the firm on their behalf

890
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,480
and the workers do as they're told.

891
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,720
And this is all based on the idea

892
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,480
that entrepreneurs and workers and managers

893
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,080
are these really clever people

894
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,120
who just know how an organization should work

895
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,960
and are really good at telling people what to do.

896
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,400
And workers at Lukas Aerospace were like,

897
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,800
no, we know exactly how this firm should be run.

898
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,000
We know what we should be doing.

899
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,240
We're perfectly capable of managing ourselves.

900
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,360
And that's why it was so much more threatening

901
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,720
to the established order

902
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,640
than even the idea of nationalization.

903
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,480
There's loads of companies

904
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,600
that were nationalized at the time.

905
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,360
This was something else entirely.

906
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,320
It threatened this idea

907
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,480
that people need to be managed and controlled.

908
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,600
And I think that is actually the most threatening thing

909
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,480
that the most threatening thing that we can believe

910
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,680
in a capitalist economy.

911
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
It's that we don't need to be managed and controlled,

912
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,720
that we have the power to govern ourselves, basically.

913
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,480
And there are a load of really amazing examples

914
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,320
of people doing exactly that in the book.

915
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,800
One of the ones that's closest to my heart,

916
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,280
you know, we mentioned Port Talbot,

917
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,760
there's this little town in North Wales

918
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,520
called Blyneifestiniog,

919
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,720
which is one of these kind of left behind areas.

920
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,240
It's a former slate mining community.

921
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,160
And instead of kind of, you know,

922
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,560
allowing themselves to be consigned to this idea

923
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,960
of like a left behind neighborhood,

924
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,920
the people in this town got together.

925
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,440
A few people started and they basically said,

926
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,200
we're going to start a community enterprise

927
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,840
to create jobs in the local area

928
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,720
and give people a fighting chance.

929
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,320
And as soon as people saw a couple of people do this,

930
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,160
they were like, why can't we set up a community enterprise?

931
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,520
Why can't we set up a community owned energy company

932
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,200
that will provide us with cheap energy

933
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,040
instead of, you know, paying tons of money

934
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
to these, you know, privatized utility companies

935
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,680
when there's hydroelectric power that's being, you know,

936
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,480
monopolized by this corporation

937
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,240
that's extracting all the wealth from this community.

938
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,400
We could actually just generate our own power ourselves.

939
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,520
And suddenly you had all of these community enterprises

940
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,000
springing up, just this incredible ethos of self-help.

941
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,560
There was some support through something called

942
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,880
the community's first program by the Welsh government.

943
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,080
But largely speaking, this was people just being like,

944
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,960
we don't have to accept things being this way.

945
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,240
We see a similar sort of thing in Preston, for example,

946
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,960
where you have the community wealth building agenda,

947
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,920
the council is supporting the creation of cooperatives,

948
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,800
democratic, local banking, all these different things.

949
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,280
The participatory budgeting movement

950
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,920
that's spread around the world where, you know,

951
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,240
residents are given the power

952
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,480
to determine how their municipal budget is spent.

953
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,040
The evidence is just so, so clear

954
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,800
that when people start to believe that they have the power

955
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,280
to be able to govern themselves,

956
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,200
to be able to make decisions about their communities,

957
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,640
about their workplaces,

958
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,400
they take that power and they wield it in service

959
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
of the collective, of their community,

960
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,600
of, you know, the people around them.

961
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,520
They basically use it to build socialism.

962
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:44,480
And the biggest thing standing in the way

963
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,680
of our getting from here to there

964
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,040
is just this pervasive and widespread belief

965
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,840
that I am on my own, there's nothing I can do.

966
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,520
The powers that are united against me are too strong

967
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,240
and, you know, no one else wants to work

968
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,280
with me to change things.

969
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,440
Which is actually why I believe, you know,

970
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,040
I'm not saying that all these small individual examples

971
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,720
of the resistance to capitalism or neoliberalism

972
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,920
are going to be enough to shift the nature

973
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,960
of the whole system.

974
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,160
What I am saying is the biggest thing

975
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,280
standing between us and progressive change

976
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,640
is basically individualism.

977
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:21,800
And these examples of people working together

978
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:26,400
to resist their exploitation, to build better communities,

979
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,600
they just shatter individualism.

980
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,320
You go to these communities and people do not share

981
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,920
this like individualistic, competitive mindset.

982
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,560
They have, you know, their own personal dreams

983
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,600
and aspirations and wants and a secure sense

984
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,880
of their own self, but they also view their identity

985
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,000
as tied to what happens to the people around them.

986
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,920
I'm really struck by these examples

987
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,920
of what a better future possibly looks like

988
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,400
within the context of what you said earlier

989
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,600
about our political paradigm,

990
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,840
that there is essentially basically a binary, right,

991
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,720
about the size of the state and the size of welfare.

992
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,480
So how do you see that better future sitting within

993
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
something that kind of, I guess you could call

994
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,320
technocratic governance, the sort of the managerialism

995
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
of Prime Minister Sunak or likely a Prime Minister Stammer?

996
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,800
Yeah, I mean, it just means democratizing everything.

997
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,800
Like just demanding more power being handed down to

998
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,480
whether that's, you know, local communities,

999
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,800
whether it's, you know, devolution and decentralization

1000
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,720
whether it's demanding workers are able to take power

1001
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,560
within their organizations, you know,

1002
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,680
the removal of the massive restrictions

1003
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,120
that have been placed on our rights

1004
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,720
to do things like protest and assemble and speak out

1005
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,320
against, you know, the horrors that are being committed

1006
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,920
by our government here and all over the world.

1007
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:51,200
It really requires like a reinvigoration

1008
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,480
at the political level when we're thinking about politics,

1009
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,840
a reinvigoration of the idea of democracy, basically.

1010
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,720
Now we live in a country where the kind of liberal

1011
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,400
democratic revolution of the kind that, you know,

1012
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,000
we saw during the 1800s, that hasn't even been completed.

1013
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,880
We've still got a monarchy.

1014
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,200
We've still got an unelected chamber in the House of Lords.

1015
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,240
We still have a private corporation that runs,

1016
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,200
you know, the heart of our financial sector,

1017
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,280
the City of London Corporation,

1018
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,960
which is a private corporation in the guise

1019
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,700
of a public local authority.

1020
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,300
So we have all these hangovers from the feudal era,

1021
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,020
the undermined democratic processes.

1022
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,980
And on top of that, we have these neoliberal shifts

1023
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,140
that have aimed to insulate even more areas of the state

1024
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,780
from democratic accountability.

1025
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,820
So, you know, we have like the Bank of England

1026
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,420
being made independent, i.e.,

1027
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,100
not subject to democratic scrutiny,

1028
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,300
which means that its decisions are much more likely

1029
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,660
to be influenced by the, you know, financial sector

1030
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,180
that has the air of bank officials

1031
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,380
than they are the preferences of ordinary people.

1032
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:56,540
You have just the outsourcing of huge swathes

1033
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,340
of public services to private corporations

1034
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,980
that, you know, you cannot really control.

1035
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,100
You cannot really hold accountable.

1036
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,860
They're supposed to be held accountable by the government,

1037
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:07,700
but the people who write the contracts

1038
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,060
according to which these services are procured

1039
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,540
also consult for the firms that are bidding

1040
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,380
for those contracts.

1041
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,300
It's this kind of revolving door of corporate power

1042
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,580
that connects like public sector institutions

1043
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:22,460
with private sector outsourcing organizations.

1044
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,460
There's no real democratic accountability there.

1045
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,500
You've seen a massive centralization of power.

1046
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,340
You know, when Thatcher came to power,

1047
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,980
she smashed the GLC.

1048
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,220
The guy who was instrumental in putting together

1049
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,500
the Lucas Plan after he was fired from Lucas

1050
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,140
for union organizing went to work for the GLC,

1051
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,460
the Greater London Corporation,

1052
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,140
which was then kind of sponsoring

1053
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:47,780
these ideas around how you could make

1054
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,220
democratic planning a reality,

1055
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,620
how you could start to bring the ideas

1056
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,860
that we saw at Lucas Aerospace to the public sector.

1057
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,380
Thatcher crushed the GLC precisely because

1058
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,940
it was doing some of that interesting experimentation.

1059
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,700
We're seeing, again, this kind of revival

1060
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,980
of that type of movement around democratic planning

1061
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,340
in places like Preston.

1062
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,020
And that's why places like Preston

1063
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,060
is seen as so threatening to the State of Squire.

1064
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,460
It's why we haven't seen what should be like...

1065
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:15,260
I spoke to a conservative the other day

1066
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,300
who said that community wealth building

1067
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,940
should be a conservative policy.

1068
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,780
It should be handing power back to communities,

1069
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,540
but they can't accept the idea that that would happen

1070
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,260
because it runs contrary to this spirit of hierarchy

1071
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,420
that is really what underpins capitalism.

1072
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,740
So, yeah, that shift towards community power

1073
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:39,620
and towards worker power and people power

1074
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:42,740
is so deeply threatening to the status quo.

1075
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:47,740
And it really requires us to just like,

1076
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:52,540
yes, kind of combat this mindset of individualism

1077
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,340
and also just like resist.

1078
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:57,580
It becomes so hard to think about

1079
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:02,740
constructive ways of resisting in the system that we have.

1080
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,620
All we can do is we kind of go online

1081
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,540
and we may be like fire off an angry tweet

1082
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,100
every now and again because we look at the system

1083
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:10,540
and it seems so broken.

1084
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:13,060
But actually, if you're able to kind of get offline

1085
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,820
and get into spaces where people are organizing with tenants

1086
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,860
to like prevent rogue landlords,

1087
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:21,580
organizing with migrants to support them

1088
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:24,180
to fight for their rights,

1089
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:25,980
just protesting on the street, getting out

1090
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,980
and making your voice heard to the political class.

1091
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,660
All of these forms of resistance are,

1092
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,980
yes, they're reactive, but they're also constructive

1093
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,300
because you start to build these bonds

1094
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,620
and these subjectivities that allow us to think beyond

1095
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:46,500
this like toxic individualism and hierarchy

1096
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,060
that makes up our current system.

1097
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,460
That's really interesting because my inclination is

1098
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,980
to compare us with the two main possible

1099
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,100
political vehicles for government in this country

1100
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,020
as technocratic organizations,

1101
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,580
particularly under Labour and the Kids at the moment.

1102
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,340
We're just hearing you then talking about street politics,

1103
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:06,020
participatory street politics.

1104
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:07,900
And I'm admittedly, I'm thinking about this now.

1105
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,660
So I don't know if you'll stand up to particularly much

1106
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:11,780
scrutiny, but in light of the shenanigans

1107
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,060
that are going on in Parliament right now,

1108
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,700
I mean, there may well be a different speaker

1109
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:15,900
of House of Commons by the time this is,

1110
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,900
so let's park that for the time being.

1111
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,140
But the Labour Party's position on Gaza,

1112
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:22,980
and I'm not trying to talk about Gaza,

1113
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,380
I want to talk about street politics here,

1114
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,860
it's changed, it's moved, it's gone from the permission

1115
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,340
of Israel to impose collective punishment on Gaza

1116
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,620
to calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.

1117
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,700
And I think you, I want to think,

1118
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:39,500
I want to think that the fact that hundreds of thousands

1119
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,460
of people have turned out on the streets of London

1120
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:43,220
weekend after weekend,

1121
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,220
has made some kind of difference to that.

1122
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,300
Maybe I'm being naive.

1123
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,220
I think it's more to do with the fact

1124
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,820
that the American state's position is slightly marginally

1125
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:55,180
shifting as a result of the utter chaos

1126
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,180
that's going to be unleashed as a result of this conflict

1127
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,420
and that Britain basically follows tail between its legs,

1128
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,380
everything that happened.

1129
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,300
We have effectively no independent foreign policy,

1130
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,540
we just kind of follow mindlessly what's going on

1131
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,820
in the US, but having said that,

1132
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,660
part of the reason that the situation is becoming

1133
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,060
so untenable over there and over here

1134
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,460
is because people are refusing, as you say,

1135
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,500
to just accept the mainstream narrative

1136
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:20,660
as to what's going on.

1137
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:21,860
I know so many people,

1138
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,660
and I think this is a widespread feeling

1139
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,020
when it comes to particularly what's going on

1140
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,740
at the moment in Gaza.

1141
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:31,380
You go online and you see just the raw footage

1142
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:36,380
that's being posted of people's limbs being blown off

1143
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,540
by weapons that are being sold to the Israeli state

1144
00:47:39,540 --> 00:47:40,940
by our government.

1145
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,220
And then you look at the news

1146
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,620
and it's just the same propaganda

1147
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,100
that's being repeated over and over again,

1148
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,460
barely any mention of the actual state of affairs

1149
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,220
on the ground in Palestine.

1150
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:57,900
Very rarely do you see a Palestinian voice

1151
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:02,020
out there kind of advocating for their people.

1152
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:05,180
Even when we had the ruling in the ICJ,

1153
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:08,220
that was barely covered on the day

1154
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:12,740
that we heard evidence against Israel.

1155
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:17,020
And I think that creates this sense of unreality.

1156
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,180
I've heard so many people say,

1157
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,460
it feels like I'm going insane

1158
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,540
because you see what is happening

1159
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,620
and then you go to institutions

1160
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:27,460
that you kind of think that you should broadly trust

1161
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:28,820
to tell you the truth

1162
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,540
and you see things are one-sided or ignored

1163
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,140
or just like kind of skewed.

1164
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,460
And then you start to think,

1165
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:40,260
well, where else is this happening?

1166
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,900
And it's not obviously just happening

1167
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,380
in Gaza at the moment.

1168
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,100
Like last year and for a long time now,

1169
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:48,460
we've been seeing basically a genocide

1170
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,660
that's been happening in Ethiopia and Tigray.

1171
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,580
No reporting on that

1172
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:55,300
because it doesn't meet the foreign policy objectives

1173
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,100
of the British state for people to know about that.

1174
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:58,740
Same thing is happening in Sudan

1175
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,020
or in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

1176
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,020
There are all these conflicts

1177
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,500
that we just don't hear about

1178
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,940
and instead we hear constantly endless coverage

1179
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,500
about what's going on in Ukraine

1180
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,980
because it meets the foreign policy objectives

1181
00:49:10,980 --> 00:49:13,540
of the British state for people to know

1182
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,380
that Russia is doing objectively horrible things.

1183
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,060
But there are lots of other governments around the world

1184
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,580
that are doing objectively horrible things,

1185
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,700
including our own.

1186
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,500
Many governments being funded by the British government,

1187
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,300
being provided arms by the British government

1188
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,740
that are also doing horrible things.

1189
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,300
And yet we hear nothing about that

1190
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,020
because it doesn't meet the foreign policy objectives

1191
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,020
of the British state.

1192
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:35,620
And I think this really comes down to a question of like,

1193
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,100
I don't think that the presenters on the BBC

1194
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:41,740
are like deliberately skewing the output

1195
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,940
that they put out there.

1196
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,220
What I do think is that how is the news agenda formed?

1197
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:47,460
Like how is the news reported?

1198
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,940
It's reported based on what happens in the papers, right?

1199
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:51,220
There's always a paper review.

1200
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,460
What determines what goes in the papers?

1201
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:54,300
Well, these are literally owned by like oligarchs

1202
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,700
and like massive corporations

1203
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,420
that just exist to promote their own interests.

1204
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:02,500
Or it is determined by what politicians say.

1205
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,460
So politicians in many ways kind of shape the news agenda.

1206
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,660
I remember talking to a presenter not that long ago

1207
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,580
who was like, well, if you want this item

1208
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,420
to be on the news agenda,

1209
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,940
then you need to get Kya Starma to say something about it

1210
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,300
because otherwise we can't report on it.

1211
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,860
It's not news, like that wouldn't be kind of objective.

1212
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:18,500
So when you have this, you know,

1213
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,700
narrowing of the political agenda

1214
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,580
among the two biggest political parties,

1215
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:26,420
the news follows and it creates this air of unreality

1216
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,260
because you're like,

1217
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:30,380
why aren't we hearing about some of the biggest,

1218
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,220
like most important issues?

1219
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,100
If you want to move away from, you know,

1220
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,060
questions around conflict,

1221
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,500
why aren't we hearing about the fact much more frequently

1222
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,020
that like last year was, you know,

1223
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,740
potentially the warmest year on record,

1224
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:43,380
maybe we're starting to see breaching the Paris agreements

1225
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,340
about 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels.

1226
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:47,940
Like these massive matter of issues

1227
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,020
that literally determine whether or not people live or die,

1228
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,780
that determine the future of humanity,

1229
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,340
we don't see them being covered

1230
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,860
because of this just like insulation

1231
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,940
like of our political class

1232
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,980
from democratic accountability.

1233
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:06,500
And the way that we have seen that begin to shift

1234
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:08,620
is when people get out onto the streets.

1235
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,820
You know, when you do have a protest that is big enough,

1236
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,420
we saw this, I remember actually,

1237
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,980
I think it was during the 2019 election campaign,

1238
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,980
suddenly climate became an issue.

1239
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,020
Like it almost kind of, it didn't come out of nowhere,

1240
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,260
but it felt like it came out of nowhere

1241
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:22,220
because these people were pouring onto the streets

1242
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:25,740
and saying, we demand action on this, right?

1243
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:28,700
And, you know, I think it is interesting seeing

1244
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:32,500
how public opinion and the news agenda can begin to shift

1245
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,020
when you do actually get people organizing

1246
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:38,780
to demand a different way of doing politics.

1247
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,060
It's really interesting to hear you say that

1248
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:44,260
because the sort of the way the British political media

1249
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:45,820
has covered the environment recently

1250
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,780
is basically in the context of whether or not

1251
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,220
labor is gonna spend 28 billion pounds of capitalization

1252
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:51,060
on it rather.

1253
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:54,100
And it becomes kind of a Westminster political story

1254
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,660
about to what extent labor is going to borrow to invest,

1255
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:57,820
which can be a high-minded one

1256
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,060
if it's had in the right way, I don't think it is,

1257
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:03,820
rather than is the price of the future ecological viability

1258
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,260
of the planet 28 billion pounds.

1259
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,100
Yeah.

1260
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:08,420
And the people who use job is that it will say,

1261
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,140
well, it's not my job to report on that.

1262
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,900
That's up to climate scientists or whatever.

1263
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,180
And it's like, well, what is the point in the news

1264
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,180
if it's literally just telling us like the shenanigans

1265
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:22,020
and the gossip of these just like closed-minded,

1266
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:24,620
half of them are corrupt politicians

1267
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:27,180
that are like swanning around Westminster being like,

1268
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,580
well, you know, I am completely in control

1269
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,740
of this democracy and everyone else

1270
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,020
will do what I tell them to do.

1271
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,060
Like, it's just, this is why it's actually so good

1272
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,380
to have such a growing and vibrant alternative media

1273
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,780
in this country because I do think, you know,

1274
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:43,860
that juxtaposition I was talking about

1275
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,380
between what you see online and what you see in the news

1276
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,860
is pushing people away from those mainstream sources

1277
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:50,940
and actually encouraging people to get their analysis

1278
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,220
and the depth of the analysis that they want.

1279
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,460
Places like here, for example.

1280
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,260
And the Vara attribute where I work.

1281
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,420
Absolutely, yeah, very much so.

1282
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,900
Last question for you and I'll try and leave it

1283
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,220
on a slightly more optimistic note.

1284
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,060
Yeah.

1285
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,820
You write in the book,

1286
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,100
since that political debate has failed to break out

1287
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:09,780
of a sterile dichotomy, those on the left argue

1288
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,780
for higher public spending funded by taxes on the rich,

1289
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:13,780
those on the right argue for cuts to public spending in tax.

1290
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:15,980
When we accede to the idea that politics is a battle

1291
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,020
between the state and the market,

1292
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:19,900
we play into the hands of the right.

1293
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,860
So what should the left be presenting as an argument

1294
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,660
or as a belief system to try and transcend that dichotomy?

1295
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:32,540
I think after that, talk about how we need

1296
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,700
to be presenting the idea of socialism,

1297
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,900
not as a project of protection,

1298
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:40,340
but as a project of collective empowerment.

1299
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:43,180
So it's not about going to people and saying,

1300
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:45,740
you know, businesses have been mean,

1301
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,660
so hand more power to me, a politician,

1302
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:50,180
and I'm going to save you.

1303
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:52,140
Or indeed, politicians have been mean,

1304
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:54,020
hand more power to me, another politician,

1305
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,860
and I'll do things differently, right?

1306
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,220
It's about demanding that the people who are in charge

1307
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:02,500
actually respect the people that they're supposed

1308
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,700
to govern enough to give them the power

1309
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,260
to shape the conditions of their lives.

1310
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,060
And what does that mean in practice?

1311
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:14,220
It means just halting this extraordinary assault

1312
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,300
on the labor movement,

1313
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,260
which by the way, the Labor Party is now considering

1314
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:21,580
rowing back on the one little tiny thing it has left,

1315
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:24,140
which is these promises on workers' rights,

1316
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,900
which are barely even enough to begin with.

1317
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:31,220
So like really just demanding the end of the assault

1318
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:35,180
on workers' rights and like a strong assertion

1319
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:37,500
of the right to unionize and collective bargaining

1320
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,180
and all these sorts of different sorts of things.

1321
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,020
That is a key pillar of democracy.

1322
00:54:42,020 --> 00:54:43,980
It is about demanding an end

1323
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,940
to the astonishingly draconian rules against protest.

1324
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,580
We've seen environmentalists being jailed

1325
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,820
for trying to bring attention to the fact

1326
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,980
that we are destroying the planet.

1327
00:54:56,140 --> 00:54:57,540
And we know that the Conservative government

1328
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:01,540
has pushed loads of, they talk about free speech, right?

1329
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:04,260
And like freedom of assembly and all these democratic rights,

1330
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,980
and they're just constantly riding roughshod

1331
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:10,100
over just like the most basic democratic principles.

1332
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:15,620
It is about supporting community organizing,

1333
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,540
about decentralization and allowing local people

1334
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:21,460
to take power within their local communities.

1335
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:26,460
And it is about also why does spread democratization

1336
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,740
of the public sector or our politics?

1337
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:31,700
That means that when we have to think about

1338
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:34,380
how we run our public services,

1339
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:36,900
rather than saying we're going to outsource running

1340
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:39,180
of our health system and social care system

1341
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,820
to capita, a giant multinational corporation

1342
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,300
that is literally skimming money out of the pockets

1343
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,820
of taxpayers and sucking up into those of shareholders.

1344
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:53,260
Why couldn't we have a democratically run

1345
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,180
public health care system or public services system?

1346
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,420
There's a really interesting example

1347
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,460
at the end of the book about Chile.

1348
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:02,340
When Salvador Aende came to power,

1349
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:05,140
and obviously he was just like, you know,

1350
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:06,980
destroyed by the United States

1351
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,740
for pushing this model of democratic socialism.

1352
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,300
He said he didn't want to go for Soviet style centralization,

1353
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,340
nor did he want to go for kind of for capitalism.

1354
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:18,540
And instead he pushed this model

1355
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:19,900
of democratic socialism,

1356
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,300
which was extraordinarily popular.

1357
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,020
And one pillar of that was how can we organize health care

1358
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,980
based on existing community networks

1359
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,380
and allowing like workers and patients

1360
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,900
and people within that system a voice

1361
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,540
as to how they were being treated, right?

1362
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:37,500
There's a completely different model.

1363
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,820
It's just, it requires like a complete rethink

1364
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,220
as to how we imagine the relationship

1365
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,380
between government and governed.

1366
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:48,820
You know, an ideal liberal political philosophy,

1367
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,500
government is supposed to be a representation

1368
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,660
of our collective power.

1369
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,620
It's supposed to be the mechanism

1370
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,900
through which we all govern ourselves.

1371
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,780
You know, the liberal theorists were like,

1372
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,140
we were in the state of nature

1373
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,420
and everyone was attacking each other.

1374
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,620
So we all came together and decided to form a state.

1375
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,500
That's obviously not what happened.

1376
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:06,140
But like arguably the true realization

1377
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,860
of the liberal dream is when government

1378
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,060
can actually become a mechanism

1379
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:13,060
through which we are all able to govern ourselves collectively

1380
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,860
where we come together to make decisions

1381
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:18,660
about the future of our society amongst ourselves

1382
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:21,980
rather than electing people who tell us what to do.

1383
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,540
Grace Blakely has been an utter pleasure.

1384
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,740
Thank you so much for your time.

1385
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:26,420
Vulture capitalism in all good bookshops.

1386
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,260
Thank you.

1387
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:28,100
Thank you.

1388
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,340
Thank you.
