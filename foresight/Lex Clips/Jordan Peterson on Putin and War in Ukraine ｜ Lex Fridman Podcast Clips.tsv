0	4880	Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.
4880	5880	Oh, yeah.
5880	11240	I got into plenty of trouble about that too.
11240	18880	You're just a man in a suit talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.
18880	22920	There's also people dying, fighting.
22920	25800	It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.
25800	28520	This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.
28520	30800	There's people trying to ask.
30800	35840	They have many dragons and they're asking themselves the question, who are we?
35840	37240	What is this?
37240	39480	What is the future of this nation?
39480	49280	We thought we are a great nation and I think both countries say this and they say, well,
49280	53200	how do we become the great nation we thought we are?
53960	57760	So first of all, you got in trouble.
57760	63680	What's the dynamics of the trouble and is it something you regret saying?
63680	64680	No, no.
64680	65680	I thought about it a lot.
65680	72200	I laid out four reasons for the war and then I was criticized in the Atlantic for the argument
72200	77280	was reduced to one reason, which was a caricature of the reason.
77280	83000	I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened, mismanagement on the part of the West in
83000	88680	relationship to Russia and foreign policy over the last since the wall fell.
88680	92520	It's understandable because it's extremely complex.
92520	98400	Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source of energy provision for Europe in the wake
98400	103920	of idiot environmental globalist utopianism.
103920	111480	The expansionist tendencies of Russia that are analogous in some sense to the Soviet
111480	113400	Union empire building.
113400	119400	And then the last one, which is the one I got in trouble for, which is Putin's belief
119400	125840	or willingness to manipulate his people into believing that Russia is a salvific force
125840	129000	in the face of idiot Western wokeism.
129000	130400	And that's the one I got in trouble for.
130400	136240	It's like, while you're justifying Putin, it's like, it's not only it's not only the
136240	139480	Russians that think the West has lost its mind.
139480	141360	Eastern Europeans think so too.
141360	142360	And do I know that?
142360	150360	It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries this spring and I talked to 300
150360	154040	political and cultural leaders and you might say, well, they were all conservatives.
154040	157640	It's like, actually, no, they weren't.
157640	160760	Most of them were conservatives because it turns out that they're more willing to talk
160760	161760	to me.
161760	169000	But a good chunk of them were liberals by any stretch of the imagination and a fair
169000	171320	number of them were canceled progressives.
171320	179320	Well, because you're very concerned about the cultural wars that perhaps are a signal
179320	187440	of a possible bad future for this country, for this part of the world, that reason stands
187440	188680	out.
188680	197720	And do you sort of looking back at four reasons think it deserves to have a place in one of
197720	198720	the four?
199440	200440	Absolutely.
200440	201440	Because it is...
201440	206360	Well, the four was bifurcated because I said, look, Putin might believe this.
206360	210000	And I actually think he does because I read a bunch of Putin's speeches and I have been
210000	211880	reading them for 15 years.
211880	216280	And my sense of people generally, and this was true of Hitler, it's like, what did Hitler
216280	217280	believe?
217280	219960	Well, did you read what he wrote?
219960	222040	He just did what he said he was going to do.
222040	227720	And you might think, well, some people are so tricky, they have a whole body of elaborated
227720	233120	speech that's completely separate from their personality and their personality is pursuing
233120	234960	a different agenda.
234960	238360	And this whole body of speech is nothing but a front.
238360	242400	It's like, good luck finding someone that's sophisticated.
242400	245000	First of all, if you say things long enough, you're going to believe them.
245000	248200	That's a really interesting and fascinating and important point.
248200	254720	Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda, I think Hitler is an example of somebody that
254720	258160	I think really quickly you start to believe the propaganda.
258160	261360	Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.
261360	264960	It's like, don't you become what you practice?
264960	268160	And the answer to that is, well, absolutely, we even know the neurology.
268160	273000	It's like when you first formulate a concept, huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so
273000	274160	to speak.
274160	278920	But as you practice that, first of all, the right hemisphere stops participating and
278920	285800	then the left participates less and less until you build specialized machinery for exactly
285800	287960	that conceptual frame.
287960	291240	And then you start to see it, not just think it.
291240	295640	And so if you're telling the same lies over and over, who do you think you're fooling?
295640	300560	Think, well, I can withstand my own lies, not if they're effective lies.
300560	305760	And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people and then they reflect them back
305760	310320	to you, what makes you think you're going to be able to withstand that?
310320	311320	You aren't.
311320	317560	And so I do think Putin believes, to the degree that he believes anything, I do believe that
317560	325760	he thinks of himself as a bulwark for Christendom against the degeneration of the West.
325760	330560	And that's that third way that Dugan and Putin have been talking about, the philosopher
330560	333200	Alexander Dugan and Putin for 15 years.
333200	336720	Now, what that is, is very amorphous.
336720	342960	Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians would have to return to the incremental development of
342960	347160	Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.
347160	350320	And to some degree, that's happened in Russia because there's been a return to Orthodox
350320	351320	Christianity.
351320	356160	Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox Church has just been co-opted by the state.
356160	358000	And I would say there's some evidence for that.
358000	365480	I've heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns, now I don't know if this is true, owns
365480	368480	five billion dollars worth of personal property.
368480	371200	And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.
371200	376160	And it's possible that the Orthodox Church has been co-opted, but there has been somewhat
376160	378600	of an Orthodox revival in Russia.
378600	380400	And I don't think that's all bad.
380400	386360	Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this, if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,
386760	391160	unfortunately, I don't think that's true.
391160	392600	I've read his speeches.
392600	394360	It doesn't look like it to me.
394360	397880	And he is by no means the worst Russian leader of the last 100 years.
399160	401320	Well, there's quite a selection there.
401320	408600	There certainly is, but I say that knowing that, even if he doesn't believe it,
410520	412520	he's convinced his people that it's true.
413400	418280	And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.
419080	421800	And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.
421800	427640	Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.
427640	432760	And a lot of people reached out to me, experts telling me how I should feel,
433720	435320	what I should think about Ukraine.
435960	439720	Oh, you naive Lex, you're so naive.
440280	441560	Here's how it really is.
442200	445960	But then I get to see people that lost their home.
445960	449400	I get to see people on the Russian side who believe they're...
450360	454520	I genuinely think that there's some degree to which they have love in their heart.
455720	460680	They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.
460680	463320	How else would you motivate young men to go fight?
463320	469400	It's just, it's these humans destroying not only their homes,
469400	473960	but creating generational hate, destroying the possibility of love towards each other.
474680	476760	They're basically creating hate.
476760	480520	What I've heard a lot of is on February 24th of this year,
481640	485320	hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.
486280	491240	Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not the soldiers in Russia,
491240	497320	but hate towards all Russians, hate that will last generations.
497320	505240	And then you can see just the pain there.
506360	517000	Then when all these experts talk about agriculture and energy and geopolitics,
517000	523240	and yeah, maybe like what you say with fighting the ideologies of the woke and so on,
523240	533720	I just feel like it's missing something deep that war is not fought about any of those things.
534440	539560	War started and war is averted based on human beings, based on humanity.
539560	544360	Here's another ugly thought since we haven't had enough so far.
547720	549400	We locked everything down for COVID.
550360	554120	How much face-to-face communication was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?
554840	555560	How about none?
556280	561400	How about that was the wrong amount, especially given that Europe was completely dependent on
561400	562920	Putin for its energy supplies?
562920	567640	Well, not completely, but you know what I mean, materially and significantly.
567640	569880	So maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.
570440	573560	Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble, probably.
573560	578120	And not just an information bubble, how all these experts tell me about-
578680	579720	No, a human bubble.
581160	583080	Look, one of the things I've really learned,
583080	586040	there's a real emphasis on hospitality in the Old Testament.
587160	589960	I just brought all these scholars together to talk about exodus.
589960	595000	Hey, I have this security team with me and they're tough military guys,
595560	598280	but they're on board for this mission, let's say.
599160	603320	And so they went out of their way to be hospitable to my academic guests.
603320	606200	They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.
606200	609160	They spent all day preparing this house I had rented
609160	611800	so that we could have a hospitable time with these scholars,
611800	615400	most of whom I didn't know well, but who said they would come and spend eight days
615400	617320	talking about this book with me.
617320	618600	We rented some jet skis.
618600	619960	We had a nice house.
619960	624760	We had fun and we got to know each other and we got to trust each other
624760	628280	because we could see that we could have some fun and that we could let our hair down a bit.
628280	632760	We didn't have to be on guard and that made the talks way deeper.
632760	636200	And then we found out we couldn't get through exodus in eight days.
636200	640680	And so I had proposed very early on that we're going to double the length.
640680	644120	And so I pulled eight people out of their lives for eight days.
644760	646840	That's not an easy thing to do.
646840	650440	It's also quite expensive and the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.
651000	653800	And they said, yes, right away.
653800	655800	So we'd love to do this again.
655800	656760	Well, why?
656760	660600	Well, partly because intellectually it was unbelievably engaging.
660600	661400	I learned so much.
661400	665080	It'll take me like a year to digest it if I can ever digest it.
665880	669720	And but they had, they had a really good time.
670280	675160	And so when they were offered that combination of intellectual challenge,
675160	677400	let's say in hospitality, it was a no-brainer.
677400	680760	They just said, every one of them said, if I can do it in any way,
680760	682200	I will definitely be there.
682200	685000	And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times
685960	689480	and the culture of hospitality has broken down in Washington.
690200	692840	40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.
693400	695000	They don't have apartments.
695000	696360	Their family isn't there with them.
697000	702360	They don't have social occasions with their fellow Democrats or Republicans,
702360	703880	much less across the table.
704920	707880	And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington
707880	710360	that were bilateral a couple of times,
710360	714600	get young Republican congressmen and Democrats together to talk.
714600	717800	And as soon as they talk, they think, oh, it was so interesting
717880	721080	because one of the lunches was about 15 people,
721080	723160	half Democrats and half Republicans.
723160	725960	And all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes talking
725960	728120	about why you decided to become a congressman,
728120	730040	which is not a job I would take, by the way.
731160	734040	You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.
734760	736120	Your family isn't there with you.
736680	739560	You have to run for re-election every two years.
739560	742520	You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?
742520	743880	You're vilified constantly.
744440	746920	This is not, you know, people think,
746920	748680	well, this is a job for the privileged.
748680	751560	It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress
751560	753960	and find out how much fun it is and put your family on the line
753960	756120	and then have to beg for your job every two years.
756120	758520	Well, your enemies, the worst of your enemies
758520	762360	and the worst of your friends are viciously hand-pecking you.
763160	765640	And so anyways, we had them all sit around a table and said,
765640	769480	okay, just say why you ran for Congress.
769480	771320	It was so cool, especially for a Canadian,
771320	773560	because you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.
773560	774760	It's something to watch.
776040	778760	It was like Mr. Smith goes to Washington for every one of them.
778760	781000	It's like, well, this country's given us so much
781000	785240	where families have been so, we've benefited so much
785240	787160	from our time here.
787160	788680	We think this is a wonderful country.
788680	791000	We really felt that we should give back.
791000	792360	Then the next one would talk
792360	794120	and it was like exactly the same story.
794120	796600	And then it didn't matter if they were Republican or Democrat.
796600	797640	You couldn't tell the difference.
797640	798760	No one could.
798760	799800	And was it genuine?
799800	802120	It's like, well, are you genuine?
802120	803720	You think these people are worse than you?
805080	806200	First of all, they're not.
807240	811000	Second of all, they're probably better, all things considered.
811000	813640	It's not that easy to become a congressman.
813640	816040	And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,
816040	818920	but by and large, you walk away from your meetings
818920	820120	with these people and you think.
822840	823880	Pretty impressive.
823880	826120	They really are giving a part of themselves
826120	827480	in the name of service.
827480	830040	Maybe over time, they become cynical
830040	834600	and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.
834600	839080	But I think a lot of it is healed, I think.
840120	842920	And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive,
842920	844200	but not fully.
844200	847400	A lot of it is healed through the power of conversation,
847400	849160	just basic social interaction.
850120	853800	I do think that the effects of this pandemic-
853800	854600	Especially by listening.
855560	857320	Listen, just sitting there,
857320	859960	and it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.
859960	863080	It's actually humor and all those kinds of things
863880	866760	about personal struggles, all those kinds of things
866760	870520	that remind you that you're all just humans.
870520	871080	Yeah.
871080	873080	Well, the great leaders that I've met,
873080	874360	because I've met some now,
875800	877400	they go listen to their constituents.
877960	879240	It's not a policy discussion.
879240	880520	It's not an ideology discussion.
880520	884200	They go say, okay, what's your life like?
884200	885480	And what are your problems?
885480	887640	And tell me about them.
887640	888600	And then they listen.
888600	889800	And then they're struck by them.
889800	891640	And then they gather up all that misery,
891640	894120	and they bring it to the congressional office
894120	895080	or to the parliament.
895080	899560	And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.
899560	903320	And the good leaders, that's a leader, leader listens.
904360	907800	So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.
908760	914040	And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour.
914200	915640	Being funny, that's hard.
916200	919160	And he said, comedy is the most stand-up comedy,
920200	922760	which is what I do in some real sense.
922760	925320	It's the thing I do that it's most akin
925320	927640	to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.
927640	928680	It's the closest analog.
929240	931640	He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.
931640	933320	And I thought, well, why?
933320	934200	What do you mean?
934200	936120	Because it's just the monologue.
936120	938120	And it's a prepared monologue.
938120	941720	I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience
941720	942760	while you're telling your jokes,
942760	943880	and you've got to get the timing right.
943880	945880	But you have a body of jokes.
946440	948280	He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.
949000	951320	And I've been told this by other comedians.
951320	953720	You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour,
954440	956520	and you got some new material, and you think it's funny.
957160	960440	And you go into a club, and you lay out your new material,
960440	962200	and people laugh at some of it.
963720	966440	And you pay attention to what they laugh at
966440	967560	and what they don't laugh at.
968200	970840	So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd.
970840	972520	And you get rid of everything that isn't funny.
973240	975640	And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,
976360	979000	the crowd will tell you what's funny.
979000	981160	So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows,
981800	982920	and each is an hour long,
982920	985720	and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.
986280	989880	So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,
989880	991480	more than 98% of it.
992120	993480	You collect two minutes per show.
994600	996120	So you're not very funny at all.
996120	997720	You're like funny 2% of the time.
997720	999800	You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.
1000760	1002760	And so that's what a leader does.
1003320	1005000	That is what a leader does, is he goes out
1005000	1007880	and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.
1008760	1010680	And then I do think that's revivifying
1011720	1013960	to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded,
1013960	1015720	because then the person can say to themselves,
1016440	1019880	despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,
1020600	1024360	I'm gathering up the misery and the hope,
1024360	1028440	and I'm bringing it forward where it can be redressed.
1028440	1029400	Giving it a voice.
1029400	1031400	Yep, giving it, that's right, giving it a voice.
