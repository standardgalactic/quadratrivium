00:00.000 --> 00:06.680
So your big assembly theory paper was published in Nature.

00:06.680 --> 00:07.680
Congratulations.

00:07.680 --> 00:08.680
Thanks.

00:08.680 --> 00:14.120
It created, I think it's fair to say a lot of controversy, but also a lot of interesting

00:14.120 --> 00:15.760
discussion.

00:15.760 --> 00:19.440
So maybe I can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong.

00:19.440 --> 00:20.840
Sorry for it.

00:20.840 --> 00:28.080
So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object, that

00:28.080 --> 00:32.240
we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create

00:32.240 --> 00:33.360
it.

00:33.360 --> 00:39.400
And also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking

00:39.400 --> 00:41.720
at how many copies of the object there are.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.360
Yeah, that's spot on.

00:43.360 --> 00:44.360
Yeah.

00:44.360 --> 00:45.360
Spot on.

00:45.360 --> 00:46.360
Spot on.

00:46.360 --> 00:47.360
I was not expecting that.

00:47.360 --> 00:48.360
Okay.

00:48.360 --> 00:50.240
So let's go through definitions.

00:50.240 --> 00:55.560
So there's a central equation I'd love to talk about, but definition wise, what is

00:55.560 --> 00:59.000
an object?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.500
Yeah, an object.

01:00.500 --> 01:08.440
So if I'm going to try to be as meticulous as possible, objects need to be finite and

01:08.440 --> 01:13.160
they need to be decomposable into subunits.

01:13.160 --> 01:16.640
All human made artifacts are objects.

01:16.640 --> 01:18.400
Is a planet an object?

01:18.400 --> 01:20.760
Probably yes if you scale out.

01:20.760 --> 01:24.920
So an object is finite and countable and decomposable.

01:24.920 --> 01:31.800
I suppose mathematically, but yeah, I still wake up some days and go to think to myself,

01:31.800 --> 01:33.040
what is an object?

01:33.040 --> 01:37.720
Because it's a non-trivial question.

01:37.720 --> 01:44.480
Persists over time, I'm quoting from the paper here, an object that's finite is distinguishable.

01:44.480 --> 01:50.680
I'm sure that's a weird adjective, distinguishable.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.640
We've had so many people offering to rewrite the paper after it came out.

01:54.640 --> 01:57.400
You wouldn't believe it's so funny.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.240
Persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from

02:02.240 --> 02:06.080
elementary building blocks is quantifiable.

02:06.080 --> 02:12.560
Such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.960
The history is in the objects.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.800
It's kind of cool, right?

02:15.800 --> 02:23.400
So what defines the object is its history or memory, whichever is the sexier word.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.520
I'm happy with both depending on the day.

02:26.520 --> 02:33.020
So the set of steps it took to create the object, so there's a sense in which every

02:33.020 --> 02:40.120
object in the universe has a history and that is part of the thing that is used to describe

02:40.120 --> 02:44.160
its complexity, how complicated it is.

02:44.160 --> 02:47.120
What is an assembly index?

02:47.120 --> 02:53.960
So the assembly index, if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it

02:53.960 --> 02:58.760
or minimal, say, well, it's like you've got a really short term memory.

02:58.760 --> 03:04.760
So what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you find the minimum number of

03:04.760 --> 03:11.240
steps you take on the path to add the parts together to reproduce the object and that

03:11.240 --> 03:15.040
minimum number is the assembly index is a minimum bound.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.280
And it was always my intuition the minimum bound and assembly theory was really important

03:18.280 --> 03:21.160
and I only worked out why a few weeks ago, which is kind of funny because I was just

03:21.160 --> 03:25.080
like, no, this is sacrosanct, I don't know why it will come to me one day and then when

03:25.080 --> 03:33.680
I was pushed by a bunch of mathematicians, we came up with the correct physical explanation

03:33.680 --> 03:37.800
which I can get to, but it's the minimum and it's really important, it's the minimum.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.240
And the reason I knew the minimum was right is because we could measure it.

03:41.240 --> 03:45.880
So almost before this paper came out, with published papers, explain how you can measure

03:45.880 --> 03:47.800
the assembly index of molecules.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.920
Okay, so that's not so trivial to figure out.

03:50.920 --> 03:56.560
So when you look at an object, we can say a molecule, we can say object more generally,

03:56.560 --> 04:01.920
to figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.520
That doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do.

04:04.520 --> 04:10.880
So with molecules, it's not trivial, but it is possible because what you can do and because

04:11.680 --> 04:16.440
I'm a chemist, I'm kind of like, I see the lens of the world through just chemistry.

04:16.440 --> 04:22.600
I break the molecule apart and break bonds and if you take a molecule and you break it

04:22.600 --> 04:28.280
all apart, you have a bunch of atoms and then you say, okay, I'm going to then take the

04:28.280 --> 04:33.480
atoms and form bonds and go up the chain of events to make the molecule.

04:33.480 --> 04:37.680
And that's what made me realize, take a toy example, literally toy example, take a Lego

04:37.680 --> 04:40.360
object, which is broken up of Lego blocks.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.320
So you could do exactly the same thing.

04:42.320 --> 04:48.440
In this case, the Lego blocks are naturally the smallest, they're the atoms in the actual

04:48.440 --> 04:51.200
composite Lego architecture.

04:51.200 --> 04:57.200
But then if you maybe take a couple of blocks and put them together in a certain way, maybe

04:57.200 --> 05:02.440
they're offset in some way, that offset is on the memory, you can use that offset again

05:02.440 --> 05:06.760
with only a penalty of one and you can then make a square triangle and keep going.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.400
And you remember those motifs on the chain.

05:09.400 --> 05:15.880
So you can then leap from the start with all the Lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front

05:15.880 --> 05:20.960
of you and say, right, I'll take you, you, you connect and do the least amount of work.

05:20.960 --> 05:27.320
So it's really like the smallest steps you can take on the graph to make the object.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.320
And so for molecules, it came relatively intuitively.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.880
And then we started to apply it to language.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.280
We've even started to apply it to mathematical theorems, but I'm so well out of my depth,

05:36.280 --> 05:41.000
that it looks like you can take minimum set of axioms and then start to build up kind

05:41.000 --> 05:44.800
of mathematical architectures in the same way.

05:44.800 --> 05:49.080
And then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that I don't yet understand.

05:49.080 --> 05:56.480
So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path in with molecules,

05:56.480 --> 05:59.840
with language, with mathematical theorems?

05:59.840 --> 06:05.880
It seems that once you have the fully constructed Lego castle or whatever your favorite Lego

06:05.880 --> 06:12.720
world is figuring out how to get there from the building, basic building blocks, isn't

06:12.720 --> 06:14.760
like a, is that an empty hard problem?

06:14.760 --> 06:15.760
It's a hard problem.

06:15.760 --> 06:16.760
It's a hard problem.

06:16.760 --> 06:20.320
But actually, if you look at it, so the best way to look at it for this, take a molecule.

06:20.320 --> 06:25.160
So if the molecule has 13 bonds, first of all, take 13 copies of the molecule and just cut

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
all the bonds.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.280
So take 12 bonds and then you just put them in order.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.000
And then that's how it works.

06:31.000 --> 06:38.640
So you keep looking for symmetry or copies so you can then shorten it as you go down.

06:38.640 --> 06:42.320
And that becomes combinatorially quite hard.

06:42.320 --> 06:46.240
For some natural product molecules, it comes very hard.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.960
It's not impossible, but we're looking at the bounds on that at the moment.

06:49.960 --> 06:54.240
But as the object gets bigger, it becomes really hard.

06:54.240 --> 06:58.240
And that's the bad news, but the good news is there are shortcuts.

06:58.280 --> 07:03.600
We might even be able to physically measure the complexity without computationally calculating

07:03.600 --> 07:05.400
it, which is kind of insane.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.400
Wait, wait, wait.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
How would you do that?

07:07.400 --> 07:13.760
Well, in the case of molecule, so if you shine light on a molecule, let's take an infrared,

07:13.760 --> 07:18.680
the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in what we call

07:18.680 --> 07:20.560
the fingerprint region.

07:20.560 --> 07:26.200
And so it's a bit like, and because it's quantized as well, you have all these discrete kind

07:26.200 --> 07:27.960
of absorbences.

07:27.960 --> 07:32.000
And my intuition after we realized we could cut molecules up in mass spec, that was the

07:32.000 --> 07:33.760
first go at this.

07:33.760 --> 07:38.480
We did it with using infrared and the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly

07:38.480 --> 07:41.200
index and we used another technique as well.

07:41.200 --> 07:45.400
In addition to infrared called NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which tells you about

07:45.400 --> 07:48.160
the number of different magnetic environments in a molecule.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.320
And that also worked out.

07:49.320 --> 07:55.700
So we have three techniques, which each of them independently gives us the same or tending

07:55.700 --> 07:59.220
towards the same assembly index for a molecule that we can calculate mathematically.

07:59.220 --> 08:00.220
Okay.

08:00.220 --> 08:04.380
So these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec.

08:04.380 --> 08:09.060
You scan a molecule, it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum.

08:09.060 --> 08:13.700
And you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index.

08:13.700 --> 08:15.660
How generalizable is that shortcut?

08:15.660 --> 08:16.660
First of all, to chemistry.

08:16.660 --> 08:22.660
And second of all, beyond that, because that seems like a nice hack.

08:22.660 --> 08:26.220
And you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry.

08:26.220 --> 08:32.580
So you can say, okay, it kind of correlates, but, you know, the whole idea behind assembly

08:32.580 --> 08:40.340
theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger.

08:40.340 --> 08:44.860
It reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe.

08:44.860 --> 08:47.180
Yeah, I'd say so, I'd agree.

08:47.180 --> 08:51.820
So I've started assembly theory of emoticons with my lab, believe it or not.

08:51.820 --> 08:56.860
So we take emojis, pixelate them and work out the assembly index and emoji and then

08:56.860 --> 09:00.260
work out how many emojis you can make on the path of emoji.

09:00.260 --> 09:05.260
So there's the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge.

09:05.260 --> 09:11.820
And then you can, so you can then take a photograph and by looking at the shortest path by reproducing

09:11.820 --> 09:15.860
the pixels to make the image you want, you can measure that.

09:15.860 --> 09:19.540
So then you start to be able to take spatial data.

09:19.540 --> 09:21.220
Now there's some problems there.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.260
What is then the definition of the object?

09:23.260 --> 09:25.540
How many pixels?

09:25.540 --> 09:26.940
How do you break it down?

09:26.940 --> 09:29.360
And so we're just learning all this right now.

09:29.360 --> 09:37.340
So how do you compute the, how would you begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical

09:37.340 --> 09:41.940
like a set of pixels on a 2G plane that form a thing?

09:41.940 --> 09:45.100
So you would first of all determine the resolution.

09:45.100 --> 09:50.300
So then how many, what is your XY and what the number on the X and Y plane and then look

09:50.340 --> 09:51.820
at the surface area.

09:51.820 --> 09:55.580
And then you take all your emojis and make sure they're all looked at the same resolution.

09:55.580 --> 10:01.700
And then we were basically then do the exactly the same thing we would do for cutting the

10:01.700 --> 10:02.700
bonds.

10:02.700 --> 10:08.820
You'd cut bits out of the emoji and look at them, you'd have a bag of pixels.

10:08.820 --> 10:12.780
And you would then add those pixels together to make the overall emoji.

10:13.780 --> 10:20.420
But like, first of all, not every pixels, I mean, this is at the core sort of machine

10:20.420 --> 10:23.660
learning and computer vision, not every pixel is that important.

10:23.660 --> 10:27.660
And there's like macro features, there's a micro features and all that kind of stuff.

10:27.660 --> 10:28.660
Exactly.

10:28.660 --> 10:31.820
Like, you know, the eyes appear in a lot of them.

10:31.820 --> 10:34.420
The smile appears in a lot of them.

10:34.420 --> 10:37.580
So in the same way in chemistry, we assume the bond is fundamental.

10:37.580 --> 10:41.700
What we do and they're here is we assume the resolution at the scale at which we do it

10:41.700 --> 10:42.700
is fundamental.

10:42.740 --> 10:45.220
And we're just working that out and that you're right, that will change, right?

10:45.220 --> 10:49.060
Because as you take your lens out a bit, you it will change dramatically.

10:49.060 --> 10:54.300
But it but it's just a new way of looking at not just compression, what we do right

10:54.300 --> 11:02.860
now in computer science and data, one big kind of kind of misunderstanding is assembly

11:02.860 --> 11:05.860
theory is telling you about how compressed the object is.

11:05.860 --> 11:06.860
That's not right.

11:07.020 --> 11:13.500
It's a how much information is required on a chain of events, because the nice thing

11:13.500 --> 11:17.620
is if when you do compression in computer science, we're wondering a bit here, but

11:17.620 --> 11:22.580
it's kind of worth wondering, I think, in you, you assume you have instantaneous access

11:22.580 --> 11:24.220
to all the information in the memory.

11:24.220 --> 11:25.220
Yeah.

11:25.220 --> 11:27.780
The assembly theory, you say, no, you don't get access to that memory until you've done

11:27.780 --> 11:28.780
the work.

11:28.780 --> 11:32.300
And then you don't access that memory, you can have access, but not the next one.

11:32.300 --> 11:36.820
And this is how in assembly theory, we talk about the four universes, the assembly universe

11:37.300 --> 11:41.980
the assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then the assembly observed.

11:41.980 --> 11:45.820
And they're all all scales in this combinatorial universe.

11:45.820 --> 11:46.820
Yeah.

11:46.820 --> 11:47.820
Can you explain each one of them?

11:47.820 --> 11:48.820
Yeah.

11:48.820 --> 11:53.580
So the assembly universe is like anything goes, just is just combinatorial kind of explosion

11:53.580 --> 11:54.580
in everything.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.580
That's the biggest one.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.220
That's the biggest one's massive.

11:57.220 --> 12:03.620
Assembly universe, assembly possible, assembly contingent, assembly observed.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.540
On the y-axis is assembly steps in time.

12:07.540 --> 12:08.540
Yeah.

12:08.540 --> 12:14.900
And, you know, in the x-axis, as the thing expands through time, more and more unique

12:14.900 --> 12:16.420
objects appear.

12:16.420 --> 12:19.420
So, yeah, so assembly universe, everything goes.

12:19.420 --> 12:20.420
Yep.

12:20.420 --> 12:24.420
Assembly possible, laws of physics come in, in this case, in chemistry bonds.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.020
In assembly, so that means-

12:26.020 --> 12:27.740
Those are actually constraints, I guess?

12:27.740 --> 12:28.740
Yes.

12:28.740 --> 12:29.740
And they're the only constraints.

12:29.740 --> 12:30.740
They're the constraints of the base.

12:30.740 --> 12:33.660
The only way to look at it, you've got all your atoms, they're quantized, you can just

12:33.660 --> 12:34.660
bung them together.

12:34.660 --> 12:38.900
So then you can become a kind of, so in the way in computer science speak, I suppose the

12:38.900 --> 12:41.580
assembly universe is just like no laws of physics.

12:41.580 --> 12:45.500
Things can fly through mountains, beyond the speed of light.

12:45.500 --> 12:51.220
In the assembly possible, you have to apply the laws of physics, but you can get access

12:51.220 --> 12:55.060
to all the motifs instantaneously with no effort.

12:55.060 --> 12:59.660
That means you could make anything, then the assembly contingent says no.

12:59.660 --> 13:03.460
You can't have access to the highly assembled object in the future until you've done the

13:03.460 --> 13:09.580
work in the past on the causal chain, and that's really the really interesting shift

13:09.580 --> 13:14.220
where you go from assembly possible to assembly contingent.

13:14.220 --> 13:18.980
That is really the key thing in assembly theory that says you cannot just have instantaneous

13:18.980 --> 13:21.020
access to all those memories.

13:21.020 --> 13:28.380
You have to have done the work somehow, the universe has to have somehow built a system

13:28.420 --> 13:32.980
that allows you to select that path rather than other paths.

13:32.980 --> 13:38.540
And then the final thing the assembly observed is basically you're saying, oh, these are

13:38.540 --> 13:39.700
the things we actually see.

13:39.700 --> 13:46.020
We can go backwards now and understand that they have been created by this causal process.

13:46.020 --> 13:47.020
Wait a minute.

13:47.020 --> 13:52.180
So when you say the universe has to construct a system that does the work, is that like

13:52.180 --> 13:55.380
the environment that allows for like selection?

13:55.380 --> 13:56.380
Yeah.

13:56.380 --> 13:57.820
That's the thing that does the selection.

13:57.860 --> 14:03.220
You could think about in terms of a von Neumann constructor versus a selection of ribosome,

14:03.220 --> 14:09.260
Tesla plant assembling Teslas, you know, the difference between the assembly universe in

14:09.260 --> 14:14.300
Tesla land and the Tesla factory is everyone says no, Teslas are just easy.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.300
They just spring out.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.300
You know how I make them all.

14:16.300 --> 14:19.460
The Tesla factory, you have to put things in sequence and out comes a Tesla.

14:19.460 --> 14:20.820
So you're talking about the factory?

14:20.820 --> 14:21.820
Yes.

14:21.820 --> 14:22.820
This is really nice.

14:22.820 --> 14:27.020
Super important point is that when I talk about the universe having a memory or there's

14:27.020 --> 14:34.300
some magic, it's not that it's that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere

14:34.300 --> 14:39.900
in physical reality, be it a cell, a Tesla factory, or something else that is making

14:39.900 --> 14:40.900
that object.

14:40.900 --> 14:45.260
I'm not saying there's some kind of woo woo memory in the universe, you know, morphic

14:45.260 --> 14:46.420
resonance or something.

14:46.420 --> 14:53.460
I'm saying that there is an actual causal process that is being directed constrained

14:53.460 --> 14:54.900
in some way.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.180
So it's not kind of just making everything.

14:57.180 --> 15:03.860
Yeah, but Lee, what's the factory that made the factory?

15:03.860 --> 15:10.500
So what is the, so first of all, you assume the laws of physics is just sprung to existence

15:10.500 --> 15:12.220
at the beginning.

15:12.220 --> 15:16.420
Those are constraints, but what makes the factory the environment that does the selection?

15:16.420 --> 15:21.660
This is the question or, well, it's the first interesting question that I want to answer

15:21.860 --> 15:23.180
out of four.

15:23.180 --> 15:28.260
I think the factory emerges in the environment, the interplay between the environment and

15:28.260 --> 15:31.540
the objects that are being built.

15:31.540 --> 15:35.540
And here, let me, I'll have a go explain to you the shortest path.

15:35.540 --> 15:38.180
So why is the shortest path important?

15:38.180 --> 15:42.620
Imagine you've got, I'm going to have to go chemistry for a moment and abstract it.

15:42.620 --> 15:49.140
So imagine you've got an environment, a given environment that you have a budget of atoms,

15:49.140 --> 15:54.580
you're just flinging together, and the, the objective of those atoms that being flung

15:54.580 --> 15:59.900
together and say molecule A have to make, they have it, they decompose.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.060
So molecules decompose over time.

16:02.060 --> 16:08.300
So the molecules in this environment, in this magic environment have to not die, but they

16:08.300 --> 16:09.300
do die.

16:09.300 --> 16:10.860
There's a, there's a, they have a half life.

16:10.860 --> 16:14.220
So the only way the molecules can get through that environment out the other side, let's

16:14.220 --> 16:18.180
pretend the environment is a box and go in and out without dying.

16:18.180 --> 16:24.540
And there's a, there's just an infinite supply of atoms coming or a, well, a large supply.

16:24.540 --> 16:31.580
The molecule gets built, but the molecule that is able to template itself being built

16:31.580 --> 16:37.020
and survives in the environment will, will basically reign supreme.

16:37.020 --> 16:42.980
Now let's say that that molecule takes 10 steps now, and it, and it's using a finite

16:42.980 --> 16:45.020
set of atoms, right?

16:45.020 --> 16:49.980
Now let's say another molecule, smart ass molecule, we'll call it comes in and can survive

16:49.980 --> 16:56.700
in that environment and can copy itself, but it only needs five steps.

16:56.700 --> 17:00.300
The molecule that only needs five steps because it's continued, both molecules are being destroyed,

17:00.300 --> 17:03.460
but they're creating themselves faster, they can be destroyed.

17:03.460 --> 17:07.860
You can see that the shortest path reigns supreme.

17:07.860 --> 17:13.060
So the shortest path tells us something super interesting about the minimal amount of information

17:13.060 --> 17:18.260
required to propagate that motif in time and space.

17:18.260 --> 17:22.100
And it's just like a kind of, it seems to be like some kind of conservation law.

17:22.100 --> 17:29.100
So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done by the things

17:29.100 --> 17:34.540
that can construct themselves in the shortest path.

17:34.540 --> 17:39.580
So like you can assume that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest,

17:39.580 --> 17:43.020
in the most efficient way.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.540
Big leap I just took there.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.900
Yeah, no, yes and no, because there are other things.

17:48.900 --> 17:53.300
So in the limit, yes, because you want to tell the difference between things that have

17:53.300 --> 18:01.060
required a factory to build them and just random processes, but you can find instances

18:01.060 --> 18:08.140
where the shortest path isn't taken for an individual object, an individual function.

18:08.140 --> 18:11.460
And people go, ah, that means the shortest path isn't right.

18:11.460 --> 18:17.700
And then I say, well, I don't know, I think it's right still because, so of course, because

18:17.700 --> 18:20.500
there are other driving forces, it's not just one molecule.

18:20.500 --> 18:25.300
Now when you start to, now you start to consider two objects, you have a joint assembly space

18:25.300 --> 18:30.340
and it's not, now it's a compromise between not just making A and B in the shortest path.

18:30.340 --> 18:35.380
You want to make A and B in the shortest path, which might mean that A is slightly longer,

18:35.380 --> 18:36.380
you have compromise.

18:36.460 --> 18:42.780
So when you see slightly more nesting in the construction, when you take a given object,

18:42.780 --> 18:47.260
that can look longer, but that's because the overall function is the object is still trying

18:47.260 --> 18:48.260
to be efficient.

18:48.260 --> 18:48.780
Yeah.

18:48.780 --> 18:55.500
And this is still very hand wavy and maybe have no legs to stand on, but we think we're

18:55.500 --> 18:56.540
getting somewhere with that.

18:56.540 --> 18:58.220
And there's probably some parallelization.

18:58.780 --> 18:59.020
Yeah.

18:59.020 --> 18:59.500
Right?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.420
So this is all, this is not sequential.

19:01.420 --> 19:04.220
The building is, I guess.

19:04.220 --> 19:04.860
No, you're right.

19:05.420 --> 19:09.500
When you're talking about complex objects, you don't have to work sequentially.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.460
You can work in parallel.

19:10.460 --> 19:12.060
You can get your friends together and they can.

19:12.060 --> 19:12.300
Yeah.

19:13.500 --> 19:18.460
The thing we're working on right now is how to understand these parallel processes.

19:18.460 --> 19:22.300
Now there's a new thing we've introduced called assembly depth.

19:23.100 --> 19:29.660
And assembly depth can be lower than the assembly index for a molecule when they're

19:29.660 --> 19:33.500
cooperating together, because exactly this parallel processing is going on.

19:34.300 --> 19:38.300
And my team have been working this out in the last few weeks because we're looking at

19:38.300 --> 19:42.220
what compromises does nature need to make when it's making molecules in a cell?

19:43.100 --> 19:50.940
And I wonder if, you know, I may be like, well, I'm always leaping out of my composites,

19:50.940 --> 19:51.900
but in economics.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.300
I'm just wondering if you could apply this in the economic process.

19:54.300 --> 19:58.620
It seems like capitalism is very good at finding shortest path, you know, every time.

19:58.620 --> 20:01.820
But there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost function has been

20:01.820 --> 20:02.940
minimized.

20:02.940 --> 20:07.580
And so I keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems,

20:07.580 --> 20:12.140
where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity,

20:12.140 --> 20:14.700
the system readjusts and finds a new shortest path.

20:14.700 --> 20:17.900
But the shortest path isn't fixed on just one molecule now.

20:17.900 --> 20:21.740
It's in the actual existence of the object over time.

20:21.740 --> 20:25.420
And that object could be a city, it could be a cell, it could be a factory.

20:25.420 --> 20:29.020
But I think we're going way beyond molecules and my competence,

20:29.020 --> 20:30.380
probably should go back to molecules.
