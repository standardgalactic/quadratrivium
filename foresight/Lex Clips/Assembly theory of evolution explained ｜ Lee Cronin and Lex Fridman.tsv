0	6680	So your big assembly theory paper was published in Nature.
6680	7680	Congratulations.
7680	8680	Thanks.
8680	14120	It created, I think it's fair to say a lot of controversy, but also a lot of interesting
14120	15760	discussion.
15760	19440	So maybe I can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong.
19440	20840	Sorry for it.
20840	28080	So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object, that
28080	32240	we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create
32240	33360	it.
33360	39400	And also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking
39400	41720	at how many copies of the object there are.
41720	43360	Yeah, that's spot on.
43360	44360	Yeah.
44360	45360	Spot on.
45360	46360	Spot on.
46360	47360	I was not expecting that.
47360	48360	Okay.
48360	50240	So let's go through definitions.
50240	55560	So there's a central equation I'd love to talk about, but definition wise, what is
55560	59000	an object?
59000	60500	Yeah, an object.
60500	68440	So if I'm going to try to be as meticulous as possible, objects need to be finite and
68440	73160	they need to be decomposable into subunits.
73160	76640	All human made artifacts are objects.
76640	78400	Is a planet an object?
78400	80760	Probably yes if you scale out.
80760	84920	So an object is finite and countable and decomposable.
84920	91800	I suppose mathematically, but yeah, I still wake up some days and go to think to myself,
91800	93040	what is an object?
93040	97720	Because it's a non-trivial question.
97720	104480	Persists over time, I'm quoting from the paper here, an object that's finite is distinguishable.
104480	110680	I'm sure that's a weird adjective, distinguishable.
110680	114640	We've had so many people offering to rewrite the paper after it came out.
114640	117400	You wouldn't believe it's so funny.
117400	122240	Persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from
122240	126080	elementary building blocks is quantifiable.
126080	132560	Such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable.
132560	133960	The history is in the objects.
133960	135800	It's kind of cool, right?
135800	143400	So what defines the object is its history or memory, whichever is the sexier word.
143400	146520	I'm happy with both depending on the day.
146520	153020	So the set of steps it took to create the object, so there's a sense in which every
153020	160120	object in the universe has a history and that is part of the thing that is used to describe
160120	164160	its complexity, how complicated it is.
164160	167120	What is an assembly index?
167120	173960	So the assembly index, if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it
173960	178760	or minimal, say, well, it's like you've got a really short term memory.
178760	184760	So what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you find the minimum number of
184760	191240	steps you take on the path to add the parts together to reproduce the object and that
191240	195040	minimum number is the assembly index is a minimum bound.
195040	198280	And it was always my intuition the minimum bound and assembly theory was really important
198280	201160	and I only worked out why a few weeks ago, which is kind of funny because I was just
201160	205080	like, no, this is sacrosanct, I don't know why it will come to me one day and then when
205080	213680	I was pushed by a bunch of mathematicians, we came up with the correct physical explanation
213680	217800	which I can get to, but it's the minimum and it's really important, it's the minimum.
217800	221240	And the reason I knew the minimum was right is because we could measure it.
221240	225880	So almost before this paper came out, with published papers, explain how you can measure
225880	227800	the assembly index of molecules.
227800	230920	Okay, so that's not so trivial to figure out.
230920	236560	So when you look at an object, we can say a molecule, we can say object more generally,
236560	241920	to figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object.
241920	244520	That doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do.
244520	250880	So with molecules, it's not trivial, but it is possible because what you can do and because
251680	256440	I'm a chemist, I'm kind of like, I see the lens of the world through just chemistry.
256440	262600	I break the molecule apart and break bonds and if you take a molecule and you break it
262600	268280	all apart, you have a bunch of atoms and then you say, okay, I'm going to then take the
268280	273480	atoms and form bonds and go up the chain of events to make the molecule.
273480	277680	And that's what made me realize, take a toy example, literally toy example, take a Lego
277680	280360	object, which is broken up of Lego blocks.
280360	282320	So you could do exactly the same thing.
282320	288440	In this case, the Lego blocks are naturally the smallest, they're the atoms in the actual
288440	291200	composite Lego architecture.
291200	297200	But then if you maybe take a couple of blocks and put them together in a certain way, maybe
297200	302440	they're offset in some way, that offset is on the memory, you can use that offset again
302440	306760	with only a penalty of one and you can then make a square triangle and keep going.
306760	309400	And you remember those motifs on the chain.
309400	315880	So you can then leap from the start with all the Lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front
315880	320960	of you and say, right, I'll take you, you, you connect and do the least amount of work.
320960	327320	So it's really like the smallest steps you can take on the graph to make the object.
327320	330320	And so for molecules, it came relatively intuitively.
330320	332880	And then we started to apply it to language.
332880	336280	We've even started to apply it to mathematical theorems, but I'm so well out of my depth,
336280	341000	that it looks like you can take minimum set of axioms and then start to build up kind
341000	344800	of mathematical architectures in the same way.
344800	349080	And then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that I don't yet understand.
349080	356480	So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path in with molecules,
356480	359840	with language, with mathematical theorems?
359840	365880	It seems that once you have the fully constructed Lego castle or whatever your favorite Lego
365880	372720	world is figuring out how to get there from the building, basic building blocks, isn't
372720	374760	like a, is that an empty hard problem?
374760	375760	It's a hard problem.
375760	376760	It's a hard problem.
376760	380320	But actually, if you look at it, so the best way to look at it for this, take a molecule.
380320	385160	So if the molecule has 13 bonds, first of all, take 13 copies of the molecule and just cut
385160	386160	all the bonds.
386160	389280	So take 12 bonds and then you just put them in order.
389280	391000	And then that's how it works.
391000	398640	So you keep looking for symmetry or copies so you can then shorten it as you go down.
398640	402320	And that becomes combinatorially quite hard.
402320	406240	For some natural product molecules, it comes very hard.
406240	409960	It's not impossible, but we're looking at the bounds on that at the moment.
409960	414240	But as the object gets bigger, it becomes really hard.
414240	418240	And that's the bad news, but the good news is there are shortcuts.
418280	423600	We might even be able to physically measure the complexity without computationally calculating
423600	425400	it, which is kind of insane.
425400	426400	Wait, wait, wait.
426400	427400	How would you do that?
427400	433760	Well, in the case of molecule, so if you shine light on a molecule, let's take an infrared,
433760	438680	the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in what we call
438680	440560	the fingerprint region.
440560	446200	And so it's a bit like, and because it's quantized as well, you have all these discrete kind
446200	447960	of absorbences.
447960	452000	And my intuition after we realized we could cut molecules up in mass spec, that was the
452000	453760	first go at this.
453760	458480	We did it with using infrared and the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly
458480	461200	index and we used another technique as well.
461200	465400	In addition to infrared called NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which tells you about
465400	468160	the number of different magnetic environments in a molecule.
468160	469320	And that also worked out.
469320	475700	So we have three techniques, which each of them independently gives us the same or tending
475700	479220	towards the same assembly index for a molecule that we can calculate mathematically.
479220	480220	Okay.
480220	484380	So these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec.
484380	489060	You scan a molecule, it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum.
489060	493700	And you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index.
493700	495660	How generalizable is that shortcut?
495660	496660	First of all, to chemistry.
496660	502660	And second of all, beyond that, because that seems like a nice hack.
502660	506220	And you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry.
506220	512580	So you can say, okay, it kind of correlates, but, you know, the whole idea behind assembly
512580	520340	theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger.
520340	524860	It reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe.
524860	527180	Yeah, I'd say so, I'd agree.
527180	531820	So I've started assembly theory of emoticons with my lab, believe it or not.
531820	536860	So we take emojis, pixelate them and work out the assembly index and emoji and then
536860	540260	work out how many emojis you can make on the path of emoji.
540260	545260	So there's the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge.
545260	551820	And then you can, so you can then take a photograph and by looking at the shortest path by reproducing
551820	555860	the pixels to make the image you want, you can measure that.
555860	559540	So then you start to be able to take spatial data.
559540	561220	Now there's some problems there.
561220	563260	What is then the definition of the object?
563260	565540	How many pixels?
565540	566940	How do you break it down?
566940	569360	And so we're just learning all this right now.
569360	577340	So how do you compute the, how would you begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical
577340	581940	like a set of pixels on a 2G plane that form a thing?
581940	585100	So you would first of all determine the resolution.
585100	590300	So then how many, what is your XY and what the number on the X and Y plane and then look
590340	591820	at the surface area.
591820	595580	And then you take all your emojis and make sure they're all looked at the same resolution.
595580	601700	And then we were basically then do the exactly the same thing we would do for cutting the
601700	602700	bonds.
602700	608820	You'd cut bits out of the emoji and look at them, you'd have a bag of pixels.
608820	612780	And you would then add those pixels together to make the overall emoji.
613780	620420	But like, first of all, not every pixels, I mean, this is at the core sort of machine
620420	623660	learning and computer vision, not every pixel is that important.
623660	627660	And there's like macro features, there's a micro features and all that kind of stuff.
627660	628660	Exactly.
628660	631820	Like, you know, the eyes appear in a lot of them.
631820	634420	The smile appears in a lot of them.
634420	637580	So in the same way in chemistry, we assume the bond is fundamental.
637580	641700	What we do and they're here is we assume the resolution at the scale at which we do it
641700	642700	is fundamental.
642740	645220	And we're just working that out and that you're right, that will change, right?
645220	649060	Because as you take your lens out a bit, you it will change dramatically.
649060	654300	But it but it's just a new way of looking at not just compression, what we do right
654300	662860	now in computer science and data, one big kind of kind of misunderstanding is assembly
662860	665860	theory is telling you about how compressed the object is.
665860	666860	That's not right.
667020	673500	It's a how much information is required on a chain of events, because the nice thing
673500	677620	is if when you do compression in computer science, we're wondering a bit here, but
677620	682580	it's kind of worth wondering, I think, in you, you assume you have instantaneous access
682580	684220	to all the information in the memory.
684220	685220	Yeah.
685220	687780	The assembly theory, you say, no, you don't get access to that memory until you've done
687780	688780	the work.
688780	692300	And then you don't access that memory, you can have access, but not the next one.
692300	696820	And this is how in assembly theory, we talk about the four universes, the assembly universe
697300	701980	the assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then the assembly observed.
701980	705820	And they're all all scales in this combinatorial universe.
705820	706820	Yeah.
706820	707820	Can you explain each one of them?
707820	708820	Yeah.
708820	713580	So the assembly universe is like anything goes, just is just combinatorial kind of explosion
713580	714580	in everything.
714580	715580	That's the biggest one.
715580	717220	That's the biggest one's massive.
717220	723620	Assembly universe, assembly possible, assembly contingent, assembly observed.
724500	727540	On the y-axis is assembly steps in time.
727540	728540	Yeah.
728540	734900	And, you know, in the x-axis, as the thing expands through time, more and more unique
734900	736420	objects appear.
736420	739420	So, yeah, so assembly universe, everything goes.
739420	740420	Yep.
740420	744420	Assembly possible, laws of physics come in, in this case, in chemistry bonds.
744420	746020	In assembly, so that means-
746020	747740	Those are actually constraints, I guess?
747740	748740	Yes.
748740	749740	And they're the only constraints.
749740	750740	They're the constraints of the base.
750740	753660	The only way to look at it, you've got all your atoms, they're quantized, you can just
753660	754660	bung them together.
754660	758900	So then you can become a kind of, so in the way in computer science speak, I suppose the
758900	761580	assembly universe is just like no laws of physics.
761580	765500	Things can fly through mountains, beyond the speed of light.
765500	771220	In the assembly possible, you have to apply the laws of physics, but you can get access
771220	775060	to all the motifs instantaneously with no effort.
775060	779660	That means you could make anything, then the assembly contingent says no.
779660	783460	You can't have access to the highly assembled object in the future until you've done the
783460	789580	work in the past on the causal chain, and that's really the really interesting shift
789580	794220	where you go from assembly possible to assembly contingent.
794220	798980	That is really the key thing in assembly theory that says you cannot just have instantaneous
798980	801020	access to all those memories.
801020	808380	You have to have done the work somehow, the universe has to have somehow built a system
808420	812980	that allows you to select that path rather than other paths.
812980	818540	And then the final thing the assembly observed is basically you're saying, oh, these are
818540	819700	the things we actually see.
819700	826020	We can go backwards now and understand that they have been created by this causal process.
826020	827020	Wait a minute.
827020	832180	So when you say the universe has to construct a system that does the work, is that like
832180	835380	the environment that allows for like selection?
835380	836380	Yeah.
836380	837820	That's the thing that does the selection.
837860	843220	You could think about in terms of a von Neumann constructor versus a selection of ribosome,
843220	849260	Tesla plant assembling Teslas, you know, the difference between the assembly universe in
849260	854300	Tesla land and the Tesla factory is everyone says no, Teslas are just easy.
854300	855300	They just spring out.
855300	856300	You know how I make them all.
856300	859460	The Tesla factory, you have to put things in sequence and out comes a Tesla.
859460	860820	So you're talking about the factory?
860820	861820	Yes.
861820	862820	This is really nice.
862820	867020	Super important point is that when I talk about the universe having a memory or there's
867020	874300	some magic, it's not that it's that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere
874300	879900	in physical reality, be it a cell, a Tesla factory, or something else that is making
879900	880900	that object.
880900	885260	I'm not saying there's some kind of woo woo memory in the universe, you know, morphic
885260	886420	resonance or something.
886420	893460	I'm saying that there is an actual causal process that is being directed constrained
893460	894900	in some way.
894900	897180	So it's not kind of just making everything.
897180	903860	Yeah, but Lee, what's the factory that made the factory?
903860	910500	So what is the, so first of all, you assume the laws of physics is just sprung to existence
910500	912220	at the beginning.
912220	916420	Those are constraints, but what makes the factory the environment that does the selection?
916420	921660	This is the question or, well, it's the first interesting question that I want to answer
921860	923180	out of four.
923180	928260	I think the factory emerges in the environment, the interplay between the environment and
928260	931540	the objects that are being built.
931540	935540	And here, let me, I'll have a go explain to you the shortest path.
935540	938180	So why is the shortest path important?
938180	942620	Imagine you've got, I'm going to have to go chemistry for a moment and abstract it.
942620	949140	So imagine you've got an environment, a given environment that you have a budget of atoms,
949140	954580	you're just flinging together, and the, the objective of those atoms that being flung
954580	959900	together and say molecule A have to make, they have it, they decompose.
959900	962060	So molecules decompose over time.
962060	968300	So the molecules in this environment, in this magic environment have to not die, but they
968300	969300	do die.
969300	970860	There's a, there's a, they have a half life.
970860	974220	So the only way the molecules can get through that environment out the other side, let's
974220	978180	pretend the environment is a box and go in and out without dying.
978180	984540	And there's a, there's just an infinite supply of atoms coming or a, well, a large supply.
984540	991580	The molecule gets built, but the molecule that is able to template itself being built
991580	997020	and survives in the environment will, will basically reign supreme.
997020	1002980	Now let's say that that molecule takes 10 steps now, and it, and it's using a finite
1002980	1005020	set of atoms, right?
1005020	1009980	Now let's say another molecule, smart ass molecule, we'll call it comes in and can survive
1009980	1016700	in that environment and can copy itself, but it only needs five steps.
1016700	1020300	The molecule that only needs five steps because it's continued, both molecules are being destroyed,
1020300	1023460	but they're creating themselves faster, they can be destroyed.
1023460	1027860	You can see that the shortest path reigns supreme.
1027860	1033060	So the shortest path tells us something super interesting about the minimal amount of information
1033060	1038260	required to propagate that motif in time and space.
1038260	1042100	And it's just like a kind of, it seems to be like some kind of conservation law.
1042100	1049100	So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done by the things
1049100	1054540	that can construct themselves in the shortest path.
1054540	1059580	So like you can assume that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest,
1059580	1063020	in the most efficient way.
1063980	1065540	Big leap I just took there.
1065540	1068900	Yeah, no, yes and no, because there are other things.
1068900	1073300	So in the limit, yes, because you want to tell the difference between things that have
1073300	1081060	required a factory to build them and just random processes, but you can find instances
1081060	1088140	where the shortest path isn't taken for an individual object, an individual function.
1088140	1091460	And people go, ah, that means the shortest path isn't right.
1091460	1097700	And then I say, well, I don't know, I think it's right still because, so of course, because
1097700	1100500	there are other driving forces, it's not just one molecule.
1100500	1105300	Now when you start to, now you start to consider two objects, you have a joint assembly space
1105300	1110340	and it's not, now it's a compromise between not just making A and B in the shortest path.
1110340	1115380	You want to make A and B in the shortest path, which might mean that A is slightly longer,
1115380	1116380	you have compromise.
1116460	1122780	So when you see slightly more nesting in the construction, when you take a given object,
1122780	1127260	that can look longer, but that's because the overall function is the object is still trying
1127260	1128260	to be efficient.
1128260	1128780	Yeah.
1128780	1135500	And this is still very hand wavy and maybe have no legs to stand on, but we think we're
1135500	1136540	getting somewhere with that.
1136540	1138220	And there's probably some parallelization.
1138780	1139020	Yeah.
1139020	1139500	Right?
1139500	1141420	So this is all, this is not sequential.
1141420	1144220	The building is, I guess.
1144220	1144860	No, you're right.
1145420	1149500	When you're talking about complex objects, you don't have to work sequentially.
1149500	1150460	You can work in parallel.
1150460	1152060	You can get your friends together and they can.
1152060	1152300	Yeah.
1153500	1158460	The thing we're working on right now is how to understand these parallel processes.
1158460	1162300	Now there's a new thing we've introduced called assembly depth.
1163100	1169660	And assembly depth can be lower than the assembly index for a molecule when they're
1169660	1173500	cooperating together, because exactly this parallel processing is going on.
1174300	1178300	And my team have been working this out in the last few weeks because we're looking at
1178300	1182220	what compromises does nature need to make when it's making molecules in a cell?
1183100	1190940	And I wonder if, you know, I may be like, well, I'm always leaping out of my composites,
1190940	1191900	but in economics.
1191900	1194300	I'm just wondering if you could apply this in the economic process.
1194300	1198620	It seems like capitalism is very good at finding shortest path, you know, every time.
1198620	1201820	But there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost function has been
1201820	1202940	minimized.
1202940	1207580	And so I keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems,
1207580	1212140	where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity,
1212140	1214700	the system readjusts and finds a new shortest path.
1214700	1217900	But the shortest path isn't fixed on just one molecule now.
1217900	1221740	It's in the actual existence of the object over time.
1221740	1225420	And that object could be a city, it could be a cell, it could be a factory.
1225420	1229020	But I think we're going way beyond molecules and my competence,
1229020	1230380	probably should go back to molecules.
