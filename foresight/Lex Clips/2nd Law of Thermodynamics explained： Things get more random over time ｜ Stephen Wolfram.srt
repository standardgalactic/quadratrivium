00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,240
You wrote the blog post, The 50 Year Quest, My Personal Journey, good title, My Personal

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,880
Journey with a Second Law, Thermodynamics.

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:17,960
So what is this law and what have you understood about it in the 50 year journey you had with

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
it?

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
Right.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,040
So Second Law of Thermodynamics, sometimes called Law of Entropy increase, is this principle

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:30,240
of physics that says, well, my version of it would be things tend to get more random

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,240
over time.

9
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,200
A version of it that there are many different sort of formulations of it that are things

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,280
like heat doesn't spontaneously go from a hotter body to a colder one.

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:50,160
When you have mechanical work kind of gets dissipated into heat, you have friction and

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:56,160
when you systematically move things, eventually there'll be sort of the energy of moving things

13
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,920
gets kind of ground down into heat.

14
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,840
So people first sort of paid attention to this back in the 1820s when steam engines

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,840
were a big thing.

16
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,480
And the big question was, how efficient could a steam engine be?

17
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:17,280
And there's this chap called Sadiq Khanou, who was a French engineer, actually his father

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,480
was a sort of elaborate mathematical engineer in France.

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:31,760
But he figured out these kind of rules for how kind of the efficiency of the possible

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,880
efficiency of something like a steam engine.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,920
And in sort of a side part of what he did was this idea that mechanical energy tends

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,520
to get dissipated as heat, that you end up going from sort of systematic mechanical motion

23
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,520
to this kind of random thing.

24
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,680
Well, at that time, nobody knew what heat was.

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,080
At that time, people thought that heat was a fluid, like they called it caloric, and

26
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:03,560
it was a fluid that kind of was absorbed into substances.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:10,040
And when heat, when one hot thing would transfer heat to a colder thing, that this fluid would

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,320
flow from the hot thing to the colder thing.

29
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:20,680
But anyway, then by the 1860s, people had kind of come up with this idea that systematic

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:30,800
energy tends to degrade into kind of random heat that could then not be easily turned

31
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,400
back into systematic mechanical energy.

32
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,880
Then that quickly became sort of a global principle about how things work.

33
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,240
The question is, why does it happen that way?

34
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,240
So, you know, let's say you have a bunch of molecules in a box and they're arranged, these

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,000
molecules are arranged in a very nice sort of flotilla of molecules in one corner of

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,160
the box.

37
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,680
And then what you typically observe is that after a while, these molecules were kind of

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,320
randomly arranged in the box.

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,280
The question is, why does that happen?

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,920
And people for a long, long time tried to figure out, is there from the laws of mechanics

41
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,840
that just determine how these molecules, let's say these molecules like hard spheres bouncing

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,720
off each other, from the laws of mechanics that describe those molecules, can we explain

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:24,880
why it tends to be the case that we see things that are orderly sort of degrade into disorder?

44
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:33,120
We tend to see things that, you know, you scramble an egg, you take something that's

45
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,320
quite ordered and you disorder it, so to speak.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,960
That's the thing that sort of happens quite regularly or you put some ink into water and

47
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:47,280
it will eventually spread out and fill up the water.

48
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,480
But you don't see those little particles of ink in the water all spontaneously kind of

49
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,040
arrange themselves into a big blob and then jump out of the water or something.

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,000
And so the question is, why do things happen in this kind of irreversible way where you

51
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,280
go from order to disorder?

52
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,880
Why does it happen that way?

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,360
And so throughout in the later part of the 1800s, a lot of work was done on trying to

54
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,120
figure out, can one derive this principle, this second law of thermodynamics, this law

55
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:27,520
about the dynamics of heat, so to speak, can one derive this from some fundamental principles

56
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,520
of mechanics?

57
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,080
In the laws of thermodynamics, the first law is basically the law of energy conservation

58
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,640
that the total energy associated with heat plus the total energy associated with mechanical

59
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,880
kinds of things plus other kinds of energy, that that total is constant.

60
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,320
And that became a pretty well understood principle.

61
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,120
But the second law of thermodynamics was always mysterious.

62
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,760
Like, why does it work this way?

63
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:54,880
Can it be derived from underlying mechanical laws?

64
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,960
And so when I was, well, 12 years old, actually, I had gotten interested, well, I'd been interested

65
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:08,080
in space and things like that because I thought that was kind of the future and interesting

66
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
sort of technology and so on.

67
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,200
And for a while, kind of, you know, every deep space probe was sort of a personal friend

68
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
type thing.

69
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,640
And I knew all kinds of characteristics of it and was kind of writing up all these things

70
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,920
when I was, well, I don't know, eight, nine, 10 years old and so on.

71
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,120
And then I got interested from being interested in kind of spacecraft.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,640
I got interested in how do they work, what are all the instruments on them and so on.

73
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,440
And that got me interested in physics, which was just as well because if I'd stayed interested

74
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:45,240
in space in the, you know, mid to late 1960s, I would have had a long wait before, you know,

75
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,320
space really blossomed as an area.

76
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,720
Adding as everything.

77
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Right.

78
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,080
I got interested in physics and then, well, the actual sort of detailed story is when

79
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,480
I kind of graduated from elementary school at age 12.

80
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:08,280
That's the time when in England where you finish elementary school, I sort of, my gift

81
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:16,080
sort of, I suppose, more or less for myself was I got this collection of physics books,

82
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,280
which was some college physics course of college physics books and volume five about statistical

83
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,840
physics and has this picture on the cover that shows a bunch of kind of idealized molecules

84
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,200
sitting in one side of a box and then it has a series of frames showing how these molecules

85
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,040
sort of spread out in the box.

86
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,280
And I thought, that's pretty interesting, you know, what causes that?

87
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,600
And you know, read the book and the book, the book actually, one of the things that was

88
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,520
really significant to me about that was the book kind of claimed, although I didn't really

89
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,440
understand what it said in detail, it kind of claimed that this sort of principle of

90
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,520
physics was derivable somehow.

91
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:03,960
And you know, other things I'd learned about physics, it was all like, it's a fact that

92
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,080
energy is conserved.

93
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,000
It's a fact that relativity works or something, not, it's something you can derive from some

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,720
fundamental sort of, it has to be that way as a matter of kind of mathematics or logic

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,720
or something.

96
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,800
So it was sort of interesting to me that there was a thing about physics that was kind of

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,040
inevitably true and derivable, so to speak.

98
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,680
And so I think that, so then I was like, there's a picture on this book and I was trying to

99
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
understand it.

100
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,680
And so that was actually the first serious program that I wrote for a computer was probably

101
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,280
1973, written for this computer, the size of a desk program with paper tape and so on.

102
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,240
And I tried to reproduce this picture on the book and it didn't succeed.

103
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,560
What was the failure mode there?

104
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,800
Like what do you mean it didn't succeed?

105
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
So it's a bunch of little-

106
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,280
It didn't look like, it didn't look like, okay, so what happened is, okay, many years

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,760
later I learned how the picture on the book was actually made and that it was actually

108
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:02,920
kind of a fake, but I didn't know that at that time.

109
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,440
But and that picture was actually a very high-tech thing when it was made in the beginning of

110
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,400
the 1960s, was made on the largest supercomputer that existed at the time.

111
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,760
And even so, it couldn't quite simulate the thing that it was supposed to be simulating.

112
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,320
But anyway, I didn't know that until many, many, many years later.

113
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,000
So at the time, it was like, you have these balls bouncing around in this box, but I was

114
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,680
using this computer with eight kilo words of memory, whatever, 18-bit words, memory words,

115
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,680
okay?

116
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,000
So it was whatever, 24 kilobytes of memory.

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,160
And it had these instructions, I probably still remember all of its machine instructions.

118
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,320
And it didn't really like dealing with floating point numbers or anything like that.

119
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,200
And so I had to simplify this model of particles bouncing around in the box.

120
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,960
And so I thought, well, I'll put them on a grid and I'll make the things just so that

121
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,880
they just sort of move one square at a time and so on.

122
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,600
And so I did the simulation.

123
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,480
And the result was it didn't look anything like the actual pictures on the book.

124
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,800
Now, many years later, in fact, very recently, I realized that the thing I'd simulated was

125
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,520
actually an example of a whole sort of computational irreducibility story that I absolutely did

126
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,760
not recognize at the time.

127
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,880
At the time, it just looked like it did something random and it looks wrong.

128
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,560
As opposed to it did something random and it's super interesting that it's random.

129
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,520
But I didn't recognize that at the time.

130
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,440
And so as it was at the time, I got interested in particle physics and I got interested in

131
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,480
other kinds of physics.

132
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,560
But this whole second law of thermodynamics thing, this idea that sort of orderly things

133
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,160
tend to degrade into disorder, continued to be something I was really interested in.

134
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:52,080
And I was really curious for the whole universe, why doesn't that happen all the time?

135
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:56,800
We start off in the big bang at the beginning of the universe was this thing that seems

136
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,440
like it's this very disordered collection of stuff.

137
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,400
And then it spontaneously forms itself into galaxies and creates all of this complexity

138
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
and order in the universe.

139
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,960
And so I was very curious how that happens.

140
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,720
But I was always kind of thinking, this is kind of somehow the second law of thermodynamics

141
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:20,920
is behind it trying to sort of pull things back into disorder, so to speak.

142
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,720
And how was order being created?

143
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,200
And so actually, I was interested, this is probably now 1980, I got interested in kind

144
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,400
of this galaxy formation and so on in the universe.

145
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,360
I also at that time was interested in neural networks.

146
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,680
And I was interested in kind of how brains make complicated things happen and so on.

147
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

148
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,880
What's the connection between the formation of galaxies and how brains make complicated

149
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
things happen?

150
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,400
Because they're both a matter of how complicated things come to happen.

151
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,960
Some simple origins.

152
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:55,400
Yeah, from some sort of known origins.

153
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:01,240
I had the sense that what I was interested in was kind of in all these different, this

154
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:07,440
sort of different cases of where complicated things were arising from rules.

155
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,960
And I also looked at snowflakes and things like that.

156
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,840
I was curious and fluid dynamics in general.

157
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,920
I was just sort of curious about how does complexity arise.

158
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:23,080
And the thing that I didn't, it took me a while to kind of realize that there might

159
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,480
be a general phenomenon.

160
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,040
I sort of assumed, oh, there's galaxies over here, there's brains over here, they're very

161
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,680
different kinds of things.

162
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,520
And so what happened, this is probably 1981 or so, I decided, okay, I'm going to try

163
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,360
and make the minimal model of how these things work.

164
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,080
And it was sort of an interesting experience because I had built, starting in 1979, I built

165
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,840
my first big computer system, I think called SMP, Symbolic Manipulation Program, it's kind

166
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,000
of a forerunner of modern or from language, with many of the same ideas about symbolic

167
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,320
computation and so on.

168
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,560
But the thing that was very important to me about that was, in building that language,

169
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:07,040
I had basically tried to figure out what were the relevant computational primitives, which

170
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:11,560
have turned out to stay with me for the last 40-something years.

171
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,840
But it was also important because in building a language, it was very different activity

172
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,880
from natural science, which is what I'd mostly done before, because in natural science, you

173
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,720
start from the phenomena of the world, and you try and figure out, so how can I make

174
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,280
sense of the phenomena of the world?

175
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:30,960
And kind of the world presents you with what it has to offer, so to speak, and you have

176
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,400
to make sense of it.

177
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:39,600
When you build a computer language or something, you are creating your own primitives, and

178
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,000
then you say, so what can you make from these?

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,080
Sort of the opposite way around from what you do in natural science.

180
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,000
But I'd had the experience of doing that, and so I was kind of like, okay, what happens

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,080
if you sort of make an artificial physics?

182
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,200
What happens if you just make up the rules by which systems operate?

183
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,360
And then I was thinking, for all these different systems, whether it was galaxies or brains

184
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,680
or whatever, what's the absolutely minimal model that kind of captures the things that

185
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,200
are important about those systems?

186
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,320
The computational primitives of that system.

187
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Yes.

188
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,960
So that's what ended up with the cellular automata, where you just have a line of black

189
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,040
and white cells, and you just have a rule that says, given a cell and its neighbors,

190
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,960
what will the color of the cell be on the next step, and you just run it in a series

191
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,360
of steps.

192
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:28,120
And the sort of the ironic thing is that cellular automata are great models for many kinds of

193
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,440
things, but galaxies and brains are two examples where they do very, very badly.

194
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,880
They're really irrelevant to those two cases.

195
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,320
Is there a connection to the second law of thermodynamics and cellular automata?

196
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Oh, yes.

197
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,760
The things you've discovered about cellular automata.

198
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,760
Yes.

199
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,760
Okay.

200
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,640
So when I first started cellular automata, my first papers about them were, you know,

201
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,160
the first sentence was always about the second law of thermodynamics, was always about how

202
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,560
does order manage to be produced even though there's a second law of thermodynamics which

203
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,080
tries to pull things back into disorder.

204
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,680
And I kind of, my early understanding of that had to do with these are intrinsically irreversible

205
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,600
processes in cellular automata that form, you know, can form orderly structures even

206
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,880
from random initial conditions.

207
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,160
But then what I realized, this was, well, actually, it's one of these things where it

208
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,800
was a discovery that I should have made earlier but didn't.

209
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,000
So you know, I had been studying cellular automata, what I did was the sort of most

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,520
obvious computer experiment.

211
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,320
You just try all the different rules and see what they do.

212
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,800
It's kind of like, you know, you've invented a computational telescope, you just pointed

213
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,720
at the most obvious thing in the sky and then you just see what's there.

214
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,760
And so I did that and I, you know, was making all these pictures of how cellular automata

215
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,760
work and starting these pictures, I studied in great detail, there was, you can number

216
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:53,120
the rules for cellular automata and one of them is, you know, rule 30.

217
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,240
So I made a picture of rule 30 back in 1981 or so.

218
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,200
Rule 30, well, it's, and I, at the time, I was just like, oh, okay, it's another one

219
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,680
of these rules, I don't really, it happens to be asymmetric, left, right, asymmetric.

220
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,240
And it's like, let me just consider the case of the symmetric ones, just to keep things

221
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,120
simpler, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

222
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,280
And I just kind of ignored it.

223
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:22,000
And then sort of in, actually, in 1984, strangely enough, I ended up having an early

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,400
laser printer, which made very high resolution pictures.

225
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,120
And I thought, I'm going to print out an interesting, you know, I want to make an

226
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:28,840
interesting picture.

227
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,960
Let me take this rule 30 thing and just make a high resolution picture of it.

228
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:33,800
I did.

229
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,560
And it's, it has this very remarkable property that its rule is very simple.

230
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,200
You started off just from one black cell at the top, and it makes this kind of triangular

231
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,760
pattern.

232
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,440
But if you look inside this pattern, it looks really random.

233
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,080
There's, you know, you look at the center column of cells and, you know, I studied

234
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
that in great detail.

235
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,720
And it's, so far as one can tell, it's completely random.

236
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,080
And it's kind of a little bit like digits of Pi.

237
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,640
Once you, you know, you know, the rule for generating the digits of Pi, but once

238
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,440
you've generated them, you know, 3.14159, et cetera, they seem completely random.

239
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,880
And in fact, I put up this prize back in, what was it, 2019 or something for prove

240
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,240
anything about the sequence, basically.

241
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,000
Has anyone been able to do anything on that?

242
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,760
People have sent me some things, but it's, you know, I don't know how hard these

243
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,400
problems are.

244
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,400
I mean, I, it's kind of spoiled because I, 2007, I put up a prize for determining

245
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,040
whether a particular Turing machine that I thought was the simplest candidate for

246
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,040
being a universal Turing machine, determine whether it is or isn't a universal Turing

247
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,480
machine.

248
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,720
And somebody did a really good job of, of winning that prize, improving that it was

249
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
a universal Turing machine in about six months.

250
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,320
And so I, you know, I didn't know whether that would be one of these problems that was

251
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,400
out there for hundreds of years, or whether in this particular case, young chap called

252
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,640
Alex Smith, you know, nailed it in six months.

253
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,480
And so with this rule 30 collection, I don't really know whether these are things

254
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,160
that are a hundred years away from being able to, to get, or whether somebody's going

255
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,720
to come and do something very clever.

256
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,720
It's such a, I mean, it's like for Mars last year, but since rule 30, such a simple

257
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,080
formulation, it feels like anyone can look at it, understand it and feel like it's

258
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:20,440
within grasp to be able to predict something, to do, to, to derive some kind of law

259
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,000
that allows you to predict something about this middle column of rule 30.

260
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:26,480
Right.

261
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,120
But you know, this is, yet you can't.

262
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,920
Yeah, right.

263
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,640
This is the intuitional surprise of computational irreducibility and so on that

264
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
even though the rules are simple, you can't tell what's going to happen and you

265
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,640
can't prove things about it.

266
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,120
And I think so, so anyway, the thing, I started in 1984 or so, I started

267
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,680
realizing there's this phenomenon that you can have very simple rules.

268
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,520
They produce apparently random behavior.

269
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,200
Okay.

270
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,640
So that's a little bit like the second orthononomics because it's like you have

271
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,680
this simple initial condition, you can, you know, readily see that it's very, you

272
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,560
know, you can describe it very easily.

273
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,520
And yet it makes this thing that seems to be random.

274
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,560
Now, it turns out there's some technical detail about the second orthononomics and

275
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,200
about the idea of reversibility when you have a, if you have kind of a, a, a movie

276
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:24,560
of two, you know, billion balls colliding and you see them collide and they bounce

277
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,080
off and you run that movie in reverse, you can't tell which way was the forward

278
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,520
direction of time and which way was the backward direction of time.

279
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,640
When you're just looking at individual billion balls, by the time you've got a

280
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,120
whole collection of them, you know, a million of them or something, then it turns

281
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:40,880
out to be the case.

282
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,080
And this is the, the sort of the mystery of the second law that the orderly thing,

283
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,120
you start with the orderly thing and it becomes disordered and that's the forward

284
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,160
direction in time.

285
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,320
And the other way round of it starts disordered and becomes ordered, you just

286
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,840
don't see that in the world.

287
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,400
Now, in principle, if you, you know, if you sort of traced the detailed motions of

288
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,160
all those molecules backwards, you would be able to, it will, it will, the reverse

289
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:14,040
of time makes, you know, as you, as you go forwards in time, order goes to disorder.

290
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,400
As you go backwards in time, order goes to disorder.

291
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,520
Perfectly so, yes.

292
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:17,880
Right.

293
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:24,360
So the, the mystery is why is it the case that, or one version of the mystery is,

294
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,280
why is it the case that you never see something which happens to be just the kind

295
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,120
of disorder that you would need to somehow evolve to order?

296
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,600
Why does that not happen?

297
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,800
Why do you always just see order goes to disorder, not the other way round?

298
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,240
So the thing that I, I kind of realized, I started realizing in the 1980s is kind

299
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,480
of like, it's a bit like cryptography.

300
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,480
It's kind of like you start off from this, this key that's pretty simple and then you've

301
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,880
kind of run it and you can get this, you know, complicated random mess.

302
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:05,600
And the thing that, that, well, I sort of started realizing back then was that the

303
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,920
second law is kind of a, a, a story of computational reducibility.

304
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,240
It's a story of, you know, what seems, you know, what, what we can describe easily at

305
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,200
the beginning, we can only describe with a lot of computational effort at the end.

306
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:30,160
Okay, so now we come many, many years later and I was trying to sort of, well, having

307
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:37,760
done this big project to understand fundamental physics, I realized that sort of a key aspect

308
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,400
of that is understanding what observers are like.

309
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:47,160
And then I realized that the second law of thermodynamics is the same story as a bunch

310
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
of these other cases.

311
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:55,960
It is a story of a computationally bounded observer trying to observe a computationally

312
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,040
irreducible system.

313
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,960
So it's a story of, you know, underneath the molecules are bouncing around.

314
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:07,360
They're bouncing around in this completely determined way, determined by rules.

315
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,680
But the point is that, that we as computationally bounded observers can't tell that there were

316
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,480
these sort of simple underlying rules.

317
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,120
To us, it just looks random.

318
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:26,240
And when it comes to this question about, can you prepare the initial state so that, um, you

319
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:31,320
know, the disordered thing is, you know, how exactly the right disorder to make something

320
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,720
orderly, a computationally bounded observer cannot do that.

321
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,720
We'd have to have done all of this sort of irreducible computation to work out very

322
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,480
precisely what this disordered state, what the exact right disordered state is so that

323
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,280
we would get this ordered thing produced from it.

324
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,560
What does it mean to be computationally bounded observer?

325
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,840
So observing a computationally irreducible system.

326
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,600
So the computationally bounded, is there something formal you can say there?

327
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,000
Right.

328
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,320
So it means, okay, you can, you can talk about Turing machines.

329
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,280
You can talk about computational complexity theory and, uh, you know, uh, polynomial

330
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,960
time computation and things like this.

331
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,200
There are a variety of ways to make something more precise, but I think it's more useful.

332
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,520
The intuitive version of it is more useful, which is basically just to say that, you

333
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,080
know, how much computation are you going to do to try and work out what's going on?

334
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,040
And the answer is you're not allowed to do a lot of, we're not able to do a lot of

335
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:35,680
computation when we, you know, we've got, you know, in this room, there will be a

336
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,520
trillion, trillion, trillion molecules, a little bit less.

337
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,600
It's a big room.

338
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:40,760
Right.

339
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,680
And, uh, you know, at every moment, you know, there, every microsecond or something,

340
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,960
these molecules, molecules are colliding and that's a lot of computation that's

341
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,600
getting done.

342
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:59,120
And the question is in our brains, we do a lot less computation every second than the

343
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,960
computation done by all those molecules.

344
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:07,400
If there is computational irreducibility, we can't work out in detail what all those

345
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,520
molecules are going to do.

346
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
What we can do is only a much smaller amount of computation.

347
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,640
And so the, the second law of thermodynamics is this kind of interplay between the

348
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:23,000
underlying computational irreducibility and the fact that we as preparers of initial

349
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,640
states or as measures of what happens are, you know, are not capable of doing that much

350
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,200
computation.

351
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,840
So to us, another big formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is this idea of

352
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,240
the law of entropy increase.

353
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,880
The characteristic that this universe, the entropy seems to be always increasing.

354
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,280
What does that show to you about the evolution of?

355
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,800
Well, okay.

356
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,840
So, so first of all, we have to say that entropy is, okay.

357
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,760
And that's very confused in the history of thermodynamics because entropy was first

358
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,280
introduced by a guy called Rudolf Clausius and he did it in terms of heat and temperature.

359
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,080
Okay.

360
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,000
Subsequently, it was reformulated by a guy called Ludwig Boltzmann.

361
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,480
And he formulated it in a much more kind of combinatorial type way.

362
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,200
But he always claimed that it was equivalent to Clausius's thing.

363
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,160
And in one particular simple example it is, but that connection between these two

364
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,880
formulations of entropy, they've never been connected.

365
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,000
I mean, there's really, so, okay, so the more general definition of entropy due to

366
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,480
Boltzmann is the following thing.

367
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,080
So you say, I have a system and it has many possible configurations.

368
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,200
The molecules can be in many different arrangements, etc., etc., etc.

369
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,880
If we know something about the system, for example, we know it's in a box,

370
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,280
it has a certain pressure, it has a certain temperature, we know these overall facts about it.

371
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:51,200
Then we say, how many microscopic configurations of the system

372
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,000
are possible given those overall constraints?

373
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,240
And the entropy is the logarithm of that number.

374
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,760
That's the definition.

375
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,800
And that's the kind of the general definition of entropy that turns out to be useful.

376
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,200
Now, in Boltzmann's time, he thought these molecules could be placed anywhere you want.

377
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,640
But he said, oh, actually, we can make it a lot simpler by having the molecules be discrete.

378
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,880
Well, actually, he didn't know molecules existed.

379
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,640
And in his time, 1860s and so on, the idea that matter might be made of discrete stuff

380
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,760
had been floated ever since ancient Greek times.

381
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,400
But it had been a long time debate about, is matter discrete, is it continuous?

382
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,640
At the moment at that time, people mostly thought that matter was continuous.

383
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,920
And it was all confused with this question about what heat is, and people thought heat was this

384
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:54,880
fluid. And it was a big, big muddle. And this Boltzmann said, let's assume there are discrete

385
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,080
molecules. Let's even assume they have discrete energy levels. Let's say everything is discrete.

386
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,040
Then we can do sort of combinatorial mathematics and work out how many configurations of these

387
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,600
things there will be in the box. And we can say we can compute this entropy quantity.

388
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,840
But he said, but of course, it's just a fiction that these things are discrete.

389
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:19,840
So he said, this is an interesting piece of history, by the way, that at that time,

390
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,840
people didn't know molecules existed. There were other hints from looking at

391
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,560
kind of chemistry that there might be discrete atoms and so on, just from the

392
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:35,040
combinatorics of two hydrogens and one oxygen make water, two amounts of hydrogen plus one

393
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,160
amount of oxygen together make water, things like this. But it wasn't known that discrete

394
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:50,400
molecules existed. And in fact, the people, it wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century

395
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,360
that Brownian motion was the final giveaway. Brownian motion is, you look under a microscope at

396
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,480
these little pieces from pollen grains, you see they're being discreetly kicked. And those kicks

397
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:07,040
are water molecules hitting them and they're discrete. And in fact, it was really quite

398
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,240
interesting history. I mean, Boltzmann had worked out how things could be discrete and

399
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,480
have basically invented something like quantum theory in the 1860s. But he just thought it

400
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
wasn't really the way it worked. And then just a piece of physics history, because I think it's

401
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:29,120
kind of interesting. In 1900, this guy called Max Planck, who'd been a longtime thermodynamics

402
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,800
person who was trying to, everybody was trying to prove the second law of thermodynamics,

403
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,400
including Max Planck. And Max Planck believed that radiation, like electromagnetic radiation,

404
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:42,720
somehow the interaction of that with matter was going to prove the second law of thermodynamics.

405
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,680
But he had these experiments that people had done on black body radiation,

406
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,360
and they were these curves. And you couldn't fit the curves based on his idea for how

407
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,000
radiation interacted with matter, those curves, you couldn't figure out how to fit those curves.

408
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,400
Except he noticed that if he just did what Boltzmann had done and assumed that

409
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,360
electromagnetic radiation was discrete, he could fit the curves. But this just happens to work this

410
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,440
way. Then Einstein came along and said, well, by the way, the electromagnetic field might

411
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,200
actually be discrete. It might be made of photons. And then that explains how this all works. And

412
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:31,600
that was in 1905, that was how that piece of quantum mechanics got started.

413
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Kind of interesting, interesting piece of history. I didn't know until I was researching this recently.

414
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:43,280
In 1904 and 1903, Einstein wrote three different papers. And so just sort of

415
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,360
well-known physics history. In 1905, Einstein wrote these three papers, one introduced relativity

416
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:58,560
theory, one explained Brownian motion and one introduced basically photons. So kind of a big

417
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:04,640
deal year for physics and for Einstein. But in the years before that, he'd written several papers,

418
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,160
and what were they about? They were about the second law of thermodynamics. And they were

419
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:14,560
an attempt to prove the second law of thermodynamics and their nonsense. And so I had no idea that

420
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:21,440
he'd done this. Interesting. Neither. And in fact, what he did, those three papers in 1905, well,

421
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,680
not so much the relativity paper, the one on Brownian motion, the one on photons,

422
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:32,320
both of these were about the story of sort of making the world discrete. And then he got

423
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,600
those like that idea from Boltzmann. But Boltzmann didn't think, you know, Boltzmann kind of died

424
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,720
believing, you know, he said, he has a quote actually, you know, in the end, things are going

425
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,320
to turn out to be discrete. And I'm going to write down what I have to say about this because,

426
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,120
you know, eventually, this stuff will be rediscovered and I want to leave, you know,

427
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,400
what I can about how things are going to be discrete. But, you know, I think he has some

428
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:03,840
quote about how, you know, one person can't stand against the tide of history in saying that,

429
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,440
you know, matter is discrete. Oh, so he's stuck by his guns in terms of matter is discrete.

430
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,920
Yes, he did. And the, you know, what's interesting about this is, at the time,

431
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,280
everybody, including Einstein kind of assumed that space was probably going to end up being

432
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,280
discrete too. But that didn't work out technically because it wasn't consistent with

433
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,640
relativity theory, it didn't seem to be. And so then in the history of physics, even though

434
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,600
people had determined that matter was discrete, electromagnetic field was discrete, space was

435
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:41,440
a holdout of not being discrete. And in fact, Einstein, 1916, has this nice letter he wrote,

436
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,600
where he says, in the end, it will turn out space is discrete, but we don't have the mathematical

437
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,760
tools necessary to figure out how that works yet. And so, you know, I think it's kind of cool that

438
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,760
a hundred years later we do. Yes, for you, you're pretty sure that at every layer of reality,

439
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,920
it's discrete. Right. And that space is discrete. And that the, I mean, and in fact, one of the

440
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:11,600
things I realized recently is this kind of theory of heat, that the, you know, that heat is really

441
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,640
this continuous fluid, it's kind of like the, you know, the caloric theory of heat, which turns

442
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,880
out to be completely wrong, because actually, heat is the motion of discrete molecules,

443
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,640
unless you know there are discrete molecules, it's hard to understand what heat could possibly be.

444
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,520
Well, you know, I think space is discrete. And the question is kind of what's the analog

445
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:41,680
of the mistake that was made with caloric in the case of space. And so, my current guess

446
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:49,040
is that dark matter is, as I've, my little sort of aphorism of the last few months has been,

447
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:55,040
you know, dark matter is the caloric of our time. That is, it will turn out that dark matter is a

448
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,800
feature of space. And it is not a bunch of particles. You know, at the time when, when people

449
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:04,800
were talking about heat, they knew about fluids. And they said, well, heat must be just be another

450
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,120
kind of fluid, because that's what they knew about. But now people know about particles. And so,

451
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:13,600
they say, well, what's dark matter? It's not, it's not, it just must be particles.

452
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,480
So what could dark matter be as a feature of space?

453
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,440
Oh, I don't know yet. I mean, I think the, the thing I'm really one of the things I'm hoping

454
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:27,440
to be able to do is to find the analog of Brownian motion in space. So, in other words, Brownian

455
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,040
motion was, was seeing down to the level of an effect from individual molecules. And so,

456
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:37,600
in the case of space, you know, most of the things, the things we see about space so far,

457
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,400
just everything seems continuous. Brownian motion had been discovered in the 1830s.

458
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:48,640
And it was only identified what it was, what it was the, the, the result of by Smoluchowski

459
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,320
and Einstein at the beginning of the 20th century. And, you know, dark matter was, was discovered,

460
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,280
that phenomenon was discovered 100 years ago. You know, the rotation curves of galaxies don't

461
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:04,880
follow the luminous matter that was discovered 100 years ago. And I think, you know, that I

462
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,320
wouldn't be surprised if there isn't an effect that we already know about that is kind of the

463
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,680
analog of Brownian motion that reveals the discreteness of space. And in fact, we're beginning

464
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,800
to have some guesses, we have some, some evidence that black hole mergers work differently when

465
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,760
there's discrete space. And there may be things that you can see in gravitational wave signatures

466
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,600
and things associated with the discreteness of space. But this is kind of, for me, it's kind of,

467
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,040
it's kind of interesting to see this sort of recapitulation of the history of physics,

468
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,440
where people, you know, vehemently say, you know, matter is continuous, electromagnetic field is

469
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,240
continuous. And turns out it isn't true. And then they say space is continuous. But, but so,

470
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,560
you know, entropy is the number of states of the system consistent with some constraint.

471
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:57,600
Yes. And the thing is that if you have, if you know in great detail the position of every molecule

472
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:05,200
in the gas, the entropy is, is always zero, because there's only one possible state. The,

473
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,440
the configuration of molecules in the gas, the molecules bounce around, they have a certain

474
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,800
rule for bouncing around. There's just one state of the gas evolves to one state of the gas and so

475
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,640
on. But it's only if you don't know in detail where all the molecules are, that you can say,

476
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:25,440
well, the entropy increases, because the things we do know about the molecules, there are more

477
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,600
possible microscopic states of the system consistent with what we do know about where the

478
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:37,200
molecules are. And so the question of whether, so people, this sort of paradox in a sense of,

479
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,360
oh, if we knew where all the molecules where the entropy wouldn't increase, there was this idea

480
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:48,320
introduced by, by Gibbs in the early 20th century, well, actually the very beginning of the 20th

481
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,760
century, as a physics professor, an American physics professor was sort of the first distinguished

482
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:02,160
American physics professor at Yale. And he introduced this idea of coarse-graining, this idea that,

483
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:06,320
well, you know, these molecules have a detailed way they're bouncing around, but we can only

484
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,000
observe a coarse-grained version of that. But the confusion has been nobody knew what a valid

485
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,040
coarse-graining would be. So nobody knew that whether you could have this coarse-graining that

486
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:25,200
very carefully was sculpted in just such a way that it would notice that the particular configurations

487
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,200
that you could get from the simple initial condition, you know, they fit into this coarse-graining,

488
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,520
and the coarse-graining very carefully observes that. Why can't you do that kind of very detailed,

489
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:41,040
precise coarse-graining? The answer is, because if you are a computationally bounded observer,

490
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,720
and the underlying dynamics is computationally irreducible, that's, that's what defines possible

491
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,120
coarse-graining is what a computationally bounded observer can do. And it's the, it's the fact that

492
00:35:53,120 --> 00:36:00,960
a computationally bounded observer is, is forced to look only at this kind of coarse-grained version

493
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,360
of what the system is doing. That's why, and because the, what's, what's going on underneath

494
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:14,080
is it's kind of filling out this, this, the different possible, you're ending up with something where

495
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:25,280
the sort of underlying computational irreducibility is your, if all you can see is what the

496
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,760
coarse-grained result is with compute, with a sort of computationally bounded observation,

497
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,480
then inevitably there are many possible underlying configurations that are consistent with that.

498
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,600
Just to clarify, basically any observer that exists inside the universe

499
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,360
is going to be computationally bounded. No, any observer like us. I don't know, I can't imagine.

500
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,400
When you say like us, what do you mean, what do you mean like us?

501
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:56,800
Well, humans with finite minds. You're including the tools of science.

502
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,440
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and, and, and as we, you know, we have more precise, and by the way,

503
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,520
there are little sort of microscopic violations of the second law of thermodynamics

504
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,760
that you can start to have when you have more precise measurements of where precisely molecules

505
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,960
are. But for, for a large scale, when you have enough molecules, we don't have, you know, we're

506
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,000
not tracing all those molecules and we just don't have the computational resources to do that.

507
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,440
And it wouldn't be, you know, I think that the, to imagine what an observer who is not

508
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,720
computationally bounded would be like. It's an interesting thing because, okay, so what does

509
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,920
computational boundedness mean? Among other things, it means we conclude that definite things happen.

510
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,520
We go, we take all this complexity of the world and we make a decision. We're going to turn left

511
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:57,040
or turn right. And that is kind of reducing all this kind of detail into we're observing it,

512
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,080
we're, we're, we're sort of crushing it down to this, this one thing. Yeah. And, and that,

513
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,760
if we didn't do that, we wouldn't, we wouldn't have all this sort of symbolic structure that we

514
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:14,400
build up that lets us think things through with our finite minds. We'd be instead, you know,

515
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,560
we'd be just, we'd be sort of one with the universe. Yeah. So content to not simplify.

516
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:28,640
Yes. If we didn't simplify, then we wouldn't be like us. We would be like the universe, like

517
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,400
the, the intrinsic universe, but not having experiences like the experiences we have,

518
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,240
where we, for example, conclude that definite things happen. We, you know, we, we sort of have

519
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,200
this, this notion of being able to make, make sort of narrative statements. Yeah. I wonder if

520
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,160
it's just like you imagined as a thought experiment, what it's like to be a computer. I wonder if it's

521
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,640
possible to try to begin to imagine what it's like to be an unbounded computational observer.

522
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,840
Well, okay. So here's, here's how that I think plays out. Vibrations.

523
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,560
Yeah. So, I mean, in this, we talk about this Ruliad, this spaceable possible computations.

524
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,400
Yes. And this idea of, you know, being at a certain place in the Ruliad, which corresponds to sort

525
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:23,040
of a certain way of, of rep, of a certain set of computations that you are representing things in

526
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:30,400
terms of. Okay. So as you expand out in the Ruliad, as you kind of encompass more possible

527
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,200
views of the universe, as you encompass more possible kinds of computations that you can do,

528
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,680
eventually you might say, that's a real win. You know, we're, we're colonizing the Ruliad.

529
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:44,080
We're, we're, we're building out more paradigms about how to think about things.

530
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:49,520
And eventually you might say, we, we, we won all the way. We managed to colonize the whole Ruliad.

531
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,200
Okay. Here's the problem with that. The problem is that the notion of existence, coherent existence

532
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,240
requires some kind of specialization. By the time you are the whole Ruliad,

533
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:05,120
by the time you cover the whole Ruliad, in no useful sense do you coherently exist.

534
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:13,600
So in other words, in, in the notion of existence, the notion of what we think of as, as, as definite

535
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:20,880
existence requires this kind of specialization, requires this kind of idea that we are, we are not

536
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,600
all possible things. We are the, a particular set of things. And that's kind of how we,

537
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,760
that that's kind of what, what makes us have a coherent existence. If we were spread throughout

538
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,280
the Ruliad, we would not, there would be no coherence to the way that we work. We would work

539
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,120
in all possible ways. And that wouldn't be kind of a notion of identity. We wouldn't have this

540
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:54,000
notion of kind of, of, of, of coherent identity. I am geographically located somewhere exactly

541
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,240
precisely in the Ruliad. Therefore, I am. Yes. Yeah, yeah, right. Well, you're in a certain

542
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,080
place in physical space, you're in a certain place in rural space. And if, if you are, if you are

543
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:13,680
sufficiently spread out, you are no longer coherent. And you no longer have, I mean, in the,

544
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:18,640
in our perception of what it means to exist and to have experience, it doesn't happen that way.

545
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:22,400
So therefore, so to exist means to be computationally bounded.

546
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:28,000
I think so. To exist in the way that we think of ourselves as existing. Yes.

547
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
The very act of existence is like operating in this place that's computationally reducible.

548
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,480
So there's this giant mess of things going on that you can't possibly predict.

549
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,280
But nevertheless, because of your limitations,

550
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:46,480
you have an imperative of like, what is it, an imperative or a skill set to simplify,

551
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,720
or an ignorance, a sufficient level. Okay. So the thing which is not obvious is that

552
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:55,600
you are taking a slice of all this complexity, just like we have all of these molecules bouncing

553
00:41:55,600 --> 00:42:00,640
around in the room. But all we notice is, you know, the, the, the kind of the flow of the air

554
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,960
or the pressure of the air, we're just noticing these particular things. And the, the big

555
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,720
interesting thing is that there are rules, there are laws that govern those big things that we,

556
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,640
we observe. So it's not obvious. That's amazing. Because it doesn't feel like it's a slice.

557
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,680
Yeah. Well, right. It's not a slice. It's like a, it's like an abstraction.

558
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,120
Yes. But, but I mean, the fact that the gas laws work, that we can describe pressure,

559
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,760
volume, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and we don't have to go down to the level of talking

560
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,440
about individual molecules, that is a non-trivial fact. And, and here's the thing that I sort of

561
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,840
exciting thing as far as I'm concerned, the fact that there are certain aspects of the universe.

562
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,720
So, you know, we think space is made ultimately these atoms of space and these hypergraphs and so

563
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:56,800
on. And we think that, but we nevertheless perceive the universe at a large scale to be like continuous

564
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:03,600
space and so on. We, in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time,

565
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:09,920
these many threads of history, yet we kind of span. So, so, you know, in quantum mechanics,

566
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:16,320
in our models of physics, there are these, time is not a single thread. Time breaks into many

567
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:23,120
threads. They branch, they merge. And, but we are part of that branching, merging universe.

568
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,280
And so, our brains are also branching and merging. And so, when we perceive the universe,

569
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,040
we are branching brains perceiving a branching universe. And so, the fact that the claim that we

570
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,520
believe that we are persistent in time, we have this single thread of experience,

571
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,040
that's the statement that somehow we managed to aggregate together those separate threads of time

572
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,120
that are separated in the operation of, in the fundamental operation of the universe.

573
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:58,400
So, just as in space, we're averaging over some big region of space and we're looking at many,

574
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,680
many of the aggregate effects of many atoms of space. So, similarly, in what we call branchial

575
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,280
space, the space of these, these quantum branches, we are effectively averaging over many different

576
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,840
branches of possible of histories of the universe. And so, and in thermodynamics,

577
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:21,120
we're averaging over many configurations of, you know, many, many possible positions of molecules.

578
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,880
So, what we see here is that the question is, when you do that averaging for space,

579
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,120
what are the aggregate laws of space? When you do that averaging over branchial space,

580
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:36,960
what are the aggregate laws of branchial space? When you do that averaging over the molecules

581
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,120
and so on, what are the aggregate laws you get? And this is, this is the thing that I think is just

582
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:48,560
amazingly, amazingly neat. Is that, that there are aggregate laws at all?

583
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,280
Well, yes, but the question is, what are those aggregate laws? So, the answer is for space,

584
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,960
the aggregate laws, Einstein's equations for gravity for the structure of spacetime,

585
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:04,160
for branchial space, the aggregate laws are the laws of quantum mechanics. And for the case of,

586
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,200
of molecules and things, the aggregate laws are basically the second law of thermodynamics.

587
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,560
And so, the, that's the, and the things that follow from the second law of thermodynamics.

588
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:21,280
And so, what that means is that the three great theories of 20th century physics,

589
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,600
which are basically general relativity, the theory of gravity, quantum mechanics,

590
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,520
and statistical mechanics, which is what kind of grows out of the second law of thermodynamics,

591
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:36,640
all three of the great theories of 20th century physics are the result of this interplay between

592
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,960
computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness of observers. And, you know, for me,

593
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:49,440
this is really neat because it means that all three of these laws are derivable.

594
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,400
So, we used to think that, for example, Einstein's equations were just sort of a wheel-in feature

595
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,880
of our universe, that they could be in my universe, might be that way, it might not be that way,

596
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,080
quantum mechanics is just like, well, it just happens to be that way. And the second law,

597
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:08,640
people had kind of thought, well, maybe it is derivable. Okay. What turns out to be the case

598
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:13,680
is that all three of the fundamental principles of physics are derivable, but they're not derivable

599
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,840
just from mathematics. They require, or just from some kind of logic or computation, they require

600
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:25,840
one more thing. They require that the observer, that the thing that is sampling the way the

601
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,040
universe works, is an observer who has these characteristics of computational boundedness

602
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:37,120
of belief and persistence and time. And so, that means that it is the nature of the observer,

603
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,880
you know, the rough nature of the observer, not the details of where we got two eyes and we

604
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:49,280
observed photons of this frequency and so on. But the kind of the very course features of the

605
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:57,200
observer then imply these very precise facts about physics. And I think it's amazing.

606
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:03,600
So, if we just look at the actual experience of the observer that we experience this reality,

607
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,360
it seems real to us. And you're saying because of our bounded nature, it's actually all an illusion.

608
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,080
It's a simplification. Well, yeah, it's a simplification. Right. What's, what's

609
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:19,040
So, you don't think a simplification is an illusion? No, I mean, it's, it's, well,

610
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,120
I don't know. I mean, what's underneath? Okay, that's an interesting question.

611
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:31,760
What's real? And that relates to the whole question of why does the universe exist? And,

612
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:38,160
you know, what is the difference between reality and a mere representation of what's going on?

613
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:41,040
Yes. We experience the representation.

614
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:49,840
Yes. But the, the question of, so, so one question is, you know, why is there a thing

615
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:56,720
which we can experience that way? And the answer is, because this Rulliard object,

616
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:03,760
which is this entangled limit of all possible computations, there is no choice about it. It

617
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,920
has to exist. It has to, there has to be such a thing. It is in the same sense that, you know,

618
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,280
two plus two, if you define what two is and you plot pluses and so on, two plus two has to equal

619
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,280
four. Similarly, this Rulliard, this limit of all possible computations, just has to be a thing

620
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:26,880
you, that is, once you have the idea of computation, you inevitably have the Rulliard.

621
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,320
You're going to have to have a Rulliard, yeah.

622
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:33,200
Right. And what's important about it, there's just one of it. It's, it's, it's just this unique

623
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:43,920
object. And that unique object necessarily exists. And then the question is, what, and then we are,

624
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,360
once, once you know that we are sort of embedded in that and taking samples of it,

625
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,520
that it's sort of inevitable that there is this thing that we can perceive that is, you know,

626
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:04,400
that our perception of kind of physical reality necessarily is that way, given that we are observers

627
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,240
with the characteristics we have. So in other words, the fact that, the fact that the universe

628
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,080
exists is, it's actually, it's almost like it's, you know, to think about it almost

629
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:22,000
theologically, so to speak. And I've really, it's funny because a lot of the questions about

630
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,840
the existence of the universe and so on, they transcend what kind of the science of the last

631
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:31,360
few hundred years has really been concerned with. The science of the last few hundred years

632
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:37,440
hasn't thought it could talk about questions like that. And, but I think it's kind of, and so a lot

633
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,120
of the kind of arguments of, you know, does God exist? You know, is it obvious that I think it,

634
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:49,920
in some sense, in some representation, it's sort of more obvious that something sort of

635
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:57,120
bigger than us exists than that we exist. And we are, you know, our existence and as observers,

636
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:02,480
the way we are is sort of a contingent thing about the universe. And it's more inevitable that the

637
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:09,200
whole universe, kind of the whole set of all possibilities exists. But this question about,

638
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,840
you know, is it real or is it an illusion? You know, all we know is our experience.

639
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:25,600
And so the fact that, well, our experience is this absolutely microscopic piece of sample

640
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:33,360
of the Ruliad. And we're, and, you know, there's this point about, you know, we might sample more

641
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:37,440
and more of the Ruliad, we might learn more and more about, we might learn, you know, like, like

642
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:44,720
different areas of physics, like quantum mechanics, for example, the fact that it was discovered,

643
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:49,440
I think, is closely related to the fact that electronic amplifiers were invented that allowed

644
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,160
you to take a small effect and amplify it up, which hadn't been possible before. You know,

645
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:59,440
microscopes have been invented that magnify things and so on. But, you know, having a very small

646
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,160
effect and being able to magnify it was sort of a new thing that allowed one to see a different

647
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,800
sort of aspect of the universe and let one discover this kind of thing. So, you know,

648
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,560
we can expect that in the Ruliad, there are an infinite collection of new things we can discover.

649
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:19,520
There's, in fact, computational irreducibility kind of guarantees that there will be an infinite

650
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,920
collection of kind of, you know, pockets of reducibility that can be discovered.

651
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,200
Boy, would it be fun to take a walk down the Ruliad and see what kind of stuff we find there.
