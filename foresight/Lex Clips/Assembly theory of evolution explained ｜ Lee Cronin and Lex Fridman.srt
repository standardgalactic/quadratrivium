1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
So your big assembly theory paper was published in Nature.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,680
Congratulations.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,680
Thanks.

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:14,120
It created, I think it's fair to say a lot of controversy, but also a lot of interesting

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,760
discussion.

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,440
So maybe I can try to summarize assembly theory and you tell me if I'm wrong.

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,840
Sorry for it.

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:28,080
So assembly theory says that if we look at any object in the universe, any object, that

9
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,240
we can quantify how complex it is by trying to find the number of steps it took to create

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,360
it.

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,400
And also we can determine if it was built by a process akin to evolution by looking

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,720
at how many copies of the object there are.

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,360
Yeah, that's spot on.

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,360
Yeah.

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,360
Spot on.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Spot on.

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,360
I was not expecting that.

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
Okay.

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,240
So let's go through definitions.

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,560
So there's a central equation I'd love to talk about, but definition wise, what is

21
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,000
an object?

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,500
Yeah, an object.

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:08,440
So if I'm going to try to be as meticulous as possible, objects need to be finite and

24
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,160
they need to be decomposable into subunits.

25
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,640
All human made artifacts are objects.

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,400
Is a planet an object?

27
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,760
Probably yes if you scale out.

28
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:24,920
So an object is finite and countable and decomposable.

29
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:31,800
I suppose mathematically, but yeah, I still wake up some days and go to think to myself,

30
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,040
what is an object?

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,720
Because it's a non-trivial question.

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:44,480
Persists over time, I'm quoting from the paper here, an object that's finite is distinguishable.

33
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,680
I'm sure that's a weird adjective, distinguishable.

34
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,640
We've had so many people offering to rewrite the paper after it came out.

35
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,400
You wouldn't believe it's so funny.

36
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,240
Persists over time and is breakable such that the set of constraints to construct it from

37
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,080
elementary building blocks is quantifiable.

38
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,560
Such that the set of constraints to construct it from elementary building blocks is quantifiable.

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,960
The history is in the objects.

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,800
It's kind of cool, right?

41
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,400
So what defines the object is its history or memory, whichever is the sexier word.

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,520
I'm happy with both depending on the day.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:33,020
So the set of steps it took to create the object, so there's a sense in which every

44
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:40,120
object in the universe has a history and that is part of the thing that is used to describe

45
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,160
its complexity, how complicated it is.

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,120
What is an assembly index?

47
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,960
So the assembly index, if you're to take the object apart and be super lazy about it

48
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,760
or minimal, say, well, it's like you've got a really short term memory.

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,760
So what you do is you lay all the parts on the path and you find the minimum number of

50
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,240
steps you take on the path to add the parts together to reproduce the object and that

51
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:15,040
minimum number is the assembly index is a minimum bound.

52
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,280
And it was always my intuition the minimum bound and assembly theory was really important

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,160
and I only worked out why a few weeks ago, which is kind of funny because I was just

54
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:25,080
like, no, this is sacrosanct, I don't know why it will come to me one day and then when

55
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:33,680
I was pushed by a bunch of mathematicians, we came up with the correct physical explanation

56
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,800
which I can get to, but it's the minimum and it's really important, it's the minimum.

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,240
And the reason I knew the minimum was right is because we could measure it.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,880
So almost before this paper came out, with published papers, explain how you can measure

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,800
the assembly index of molecules.

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,920
Okay, so that's not so trivial to figure out.

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,560
So when you look at an object, we can say a molecule, we can say object more generally,

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,920
to figure out the minimum number of steps it takes to create that object.

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,520
That doesn't seem like a trivial thing to do.

64
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,880
So with molecules, it's not trivial, but it is possible because what you can do and because

65
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,440
I'm a chemist, I'm kind of like, I see the lens of the world through just chemistry.

66
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,600
I break the molecule apart and break bonds and if you take a molecule and you break it

67
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,280
all apart, you have a bunch of atoms and then you say, okay, I'm going to then take the

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,480
atoms and form bonds and go up the chain of events to make the molecule.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,680
And that's what made me realize, take a toy example, literally toy example, take a Lego

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,360
object, which is broken up of Lego blocks.

71
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,320
So you could do exactly the same thing.

72
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,440
In this case, the Lego blocks are naturally the smallest, they're the atoms in the actual

73
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,200
composite Lego architecture.

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,200
But then if you maybe take a couple of blocks and put them together in a certain way, maybe

75
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,440
they're offset in some way, that offset is on the memory, you can use that offset again

76
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,760
with only a penalty of one and you can then make a square triangle and keep going.

77
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,400
And you remember those motifs on the chain.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,880
So you can then leap from the start with all the Lego blocks or atoms just laid out in front

79
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,960
of you and say, right, I'll take you, you, you connect and do the least amount of work.

80
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,320
So it's really like the smallest steps you can take on the graph to make the object.

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
And so for molecules, it came relatively intuitively.

82
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
And then we started to apply it to language.

83
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,280
We've even started to apply it to mathematical theorems, but I'm so well out of my depth,

84
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:41,000
that it looks like you can take minimum set of axioms and then start to build up kind

85
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,800
of mathematical architectures in the same way.

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,080
And then the shortest path to get there is something interesting that I don't yet understand.

87
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,480
So what's the computational complexity of figuring out the shortest path in with molecules,

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,840
with language, with mathematical theorems?

89
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,880
It seems that once you have the fully constructed Lego castle or whatever your favorite Lego

90
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,720
world is figuring out how to get there from the building, basic building blocks, isn't

91
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,760
like a, is that an empty hard problem?

92
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,760
It's a hard problem.

93
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
It's a hard problem.

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,320
But actually, if you look at it, so the best way to look at it for this, take a molecule.

95
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,160
So if the molecule has 13 bonds, first of all, take 13 copies of the molecule and just cut

96
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
all the bonds.

97
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
So take 12 bonds and then you just put them in order.

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,000
And then that's how it works.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,640
So you keep looking for symmetry or copies so you can then shorten it as you go down.

100
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,320
And that becomes combinatorially quite hard.

101
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:46,240
For some natural product molecules, it comes very hard.

102
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,960
It's not impossible, but we're looking at the bounds on that at the moment.

103
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,240
But as the object gets bigger, it becomes really hard.

104
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,240
And that's the bad news, but the good news is there are shortcuts.

105
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,600
We might even be able to physically measure the complexity without computationally calculating

106
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
it, which is kind of insane.

107
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Wait, wait, wait.

108
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
How would you do that?

109
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,760
Well, in the case of molecule, so if you shine light on a molecule, let's take an infrared,

110
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,680
the molecule has each of the bonds absorbs the infrared differently in what we call

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,560
the fingerprint region.

112
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,200
And so it's a bit like, and because it's quantized as well, you have all these discrete kind

113
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,960
of absorbences.

114
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:32,000
And my intuition after we realized we could cut molecules up in mass spec, that was the

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
first go at this.

116
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,480
We did it with using infrared and the infrared gave us an even better correlation assembly

117
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,200
index and we used another technique as well.

118
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,400
In addition to infrared called NMR, nuclear magnetic resonance, which tells you about

119
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,160
the number of different magnetic environments in a molecule.

120
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,320
And that also worked out.

121
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,700
So we have three techniques, which each of them independently gives us the same or tending

122
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:59,220
towards the same assembly index for a molecule that we can calculate mathematically.

123
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,220
Okay.

124
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,380
So these are all methods of mass spectrometry, mass spec.

125
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,060
You scan a molecule, it gives you data in the form of a mass spectrum.

126
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,700
And you're saying that the data correlates to the assembly index.

127
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,660
How generalizable is that shortcut?

128
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,660
First of all, to chemistry.

129
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:22,660
And second of all, beyond that, because that seems like a nice hack.

130
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,220
And you're extremely knowledgeable about various aspects of chemistry.

131
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,580
So you can say, okay, it kind of correlates, but, you know, the whole idea behind assembly

132
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:40,340
theory paper and perhaps why it's so controversial is that it reaches bigger.

133
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,860
It reaches for the bigger general theory of objects in the universe.

134
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,180
Yeah, I'd say so, I'd agree.

135
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:51,820
So I've started assembly theory of emoticons with my lab, believe it or not.

136
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,860
So we take emojis, pixelate them and work out the assembly index and emoji and then

137
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:00,260
work out how many emojis you can make on the path of emoji.

138
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:05,260
So there's the uber emoji from which all other emojis emerge.

139
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,820
And then you can, so you can then take a photograph and by looking at the shortest path by reproducing

140
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,860
the pixels to make the image you want, you can measure that.

141
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,540
So then you start to be able to take spatial data.

142
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,220
Now there's some problems there.

143
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,260
What is then the definition of the object?

144
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,540
How many pixels?

145
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,940
How do you break it down?

146
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,360
And so we're just learning all this right now.

147
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,340
So how do you compute the, how would you begin to compute the assembly index of a graphical

148
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,940
like a set of pixels on a 2G plane that form a thing?

149
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,100
So you would first of all determine the resolution.

150
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,300
So then how many, what is your XY and what the number on the X and Y plane and then look

151
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,820
at the surface area.

152
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,580
And then you take all your emojis and make sure they're all looked at the same resolution.

153
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:01,700
And then we were basically then do the exactly the same thing we would do for cutting the

154
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
bonds.

155
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,820
You'd cut bits out of the emoji and look at them, you'd have a bag of pixels.

156
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,780
And you would then add those pixels together to make the overall emoji.

157
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,420
But like, first of all, not every pixels, I mean, this is at the core sort of machine

158
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,660
learning and computer vision, not every pixel is that important.

159
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,660
And there's like macro features, there's a micro features and all that kind of stuff.

160
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Exactly.

161
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,820
Like, you know, the eyes appear in a lot of them.

162
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,420
The smile appears in a lot of them.

163
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:37,580
So in the same way in chemistry, we assume the bond is fundamental.

164
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,700
What we do and they're here is we assume the resolution at the scale at which we do it

165
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,700
is fundamental.

166
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,220
And we're just working that out and that you're right, that will change, right?

167
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,060
Because as you take your lens out a bit, you it will change dramatically.

168
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,300
But it but it's just a new way of looking at not just compression, what we do right

169
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:02,860
now in computer science and data, one big kind of kind of misunderstanding is assembly

170
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
theory is telling you about how compressed the object is.

171
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,860
That's not right.

172
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:13,500
It's a how much information is required on a chain of events, because the nice thing

173
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,620
is if when you do compression in computer science, we're wondering a bit here, but

174
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,580
it's kind of worth wondering, I think, in you, you assume you have instantaneous access

175
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,220
to all the information in the memory.

176
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,220
Yeah.

177
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,780
The assembly theory, you say, no, you don't get access to that memory until you've done

178
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
the work.

179
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,300
And then you don't access that memory, you can have access, but not the next one.

180
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,820
And this is how in assembly theory, we talk about the four universes, the assembly universe

181
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,980
the assembly possible, and the assembly contingent, and then the assembly observed.

182
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,820
And they're all all scales in this combinatorial universe.

183
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,820
Yeah.

184
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,820
Can you explain each one of them?

185
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
Yeah.

186
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:53,580
So the assembly universe is like anything goes, just is just combinatorial kind of explosion

187
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
in everything.

188
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
That's the biggest one.

189
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,220
That's the biggest one's massive.

190
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,620
Assembly universe, assembly possible, assembly contingent, assembly observed.

191
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,540
On the y-axis is assembly steps in time.

192
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,540
Yeah.

193
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:14,900
And, you know, in the x-axis, as the thing expands through time, more and more unique

194
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,420
objects appear.

195
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:19,420
So, yeah, so assembly universe, everything goes.

196
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Yep.

197
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,420
Assembly possible, laws of physics come in, in this case, in chemistry bonds.

198
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:26,020
In assembly, so that means-

199
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,740
Those are actually constraints, I guess?

200
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,740
Yes.

201
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,740
And they're the only constraints.

202
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
They're the constraints of the base.

203
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,660
The only way to look at it, you've got all your atoms, they're quantized, you can just

204
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,660
bung them together.

205
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:38,900
So then you can become a kind of, so in the way in computer science speak, I suppose the

206
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,580
assembly universe is just like no laws of physics.

207
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,500
Things can fly through mountains, beyond the speed of light.

208
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,220
In the assembly possible, you have to apply the laws of physics, but you can get access

209
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,060
to all the motifs instantaneously with no effort.

210
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,660
That means you could make anything, then the assembly contingent says no.

211
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,460
You can't have access to the highly assembled object in the future until you've done the

212
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:09,580
work in the past on the causal chain, and that's really the really interesting shift

213
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,220
where you go from assembly possible to assembly contingent.

214
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:18,980
That is really the key thing in assembly theory that says you cannot just have instantaneous

215
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:21,020
access to all those memories.

216
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:28,380
You have to have done the work somehow, the universe has to have somehow built a system

217
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,980
that allows you to select that path rather than other paths.

218
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:38,540
And then the final thing the assembly observed is basically you're saying, oh, these are

219
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,700
the things we actually see.

220
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,020
We can go backwards now and understand that they have been created by this causal process.

221
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Wait a minute.

222
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:52,180
So when you say the universe has to construct a system that does the work, is that like

223
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,380
the environment that allows for like selection?

224
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Yeah.

225
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,820
That's the thing that does the selection.

226
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,220
You could think about in terms of a von Neumann constructor versus a selection of ribosome,

227
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,260
Tesla plant assembling Teslas, you know, the difference between the assembly universe in

228
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,300
Tesla land and the Tesla factory is everyone says no, Teslas are just easy.

229
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,300
They just spring out.

230
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,300
You know how I make them all.

231
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,460
The Tesla factory, you have to put things in sequence and out comes a Tesla.

232
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,820
So you're talking about the factory?

233
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,820
Yes.

234
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,820
This is really nice.

235
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,020
Super important point is that when I talk about the universe having a memory or there's

236
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:34,300
some magic, it's not that it's that tells you that there must be a process encoded somewhere

237
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:39,900
in physical reality, be it a cell, a Tesla factory, or something else that is making

238
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
that object.

239
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,260
I'm not saying there's some kind of woo woo memory in the universe, you know, morphic

240
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,420
resonance or something.

241
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:53,460
I'm saying that there is an actual causal process that is being directed constrained

242
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,900
in some way.

243
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,180
So it's not kind of just making everything.

244
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,860
Yeah, but Lee, what's the factory that made the factory?

245
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:10,500
So what is the, so first of all, you assume the laws of physics is just sprung to existence

246
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,220
at the beginning.

247
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:16,420
Those are constraints, but what makes the factory the environment that does the selection?

248
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,660
This is the question or, well, it's the first interesting question that I want to answer

249
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,180
out of four.

250
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:28,260
I think the factory emerges in the environment, the interplay between the environment and

251
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,540
the objects that are being built.

252
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,540
And here, let me, I'll have a go explain to you the shortest path.

253
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,180
So why is the shortest path important?

254
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,620
Imagine you've got, I'm going to have to go chemistry for a moment and abstract it.

255
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:49,140
So imagine you've got an environment, a given environment that you have a budget of atoms,

256
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:54,580
you're just flinging together, and the, the objective of those atoms that being flung

257
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:59,900
together and say molecule A have to make, they have it, they decompose.

258
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,060
So molecules decompose over time.

259
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,300
So the molecules in this environment, in this magic environment have to not die, but they

260
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
do die.

261
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,860
There's a, there's a, they have a half life.

262
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,220
So the only way the molecules can get through that environment out the other side, let's

263
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:18,180
pretend the environment is a box and go in and out without dying.

264
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,540
And there's a, there's just an infinite supply of atoms coming or a, well, a large supply.

265
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:31,580
The molecule gets built, but the molecule that is able to template itself being built

266
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:37,020
and survives in the environment will, will basically reign supreme.

267
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,980
Now let's say that that molecule takes 10 steps now, and it, and it's using a finite

268
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,020
set of atoms, right?

269
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,980
Now let's say another molecule, smart ass molecule, we'll call it comes in and can survive

270
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,700
in that environment and can copy itself, but it only needs five steps.

271
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,300
The molecule that only needs five steps because it's continued, both molecules are being destroyed,

272
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,460
but they're creating themselves faster, they can be destroyed.

273
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:07,860
You can see that the shortest path reigns supreme.

274
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:13,060
So the shortest path tells us something super interesting about the minimal amount of information

275
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:18,260
required to propagate that motif in time and space.

276
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,100
And it's just like a kind of, it seems to be like some kind of conservation law.

277
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:29,100
So one of the intuitions you have is the propagation of motifs in time will be done by the things

278
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:34,540
that can construct themselves in the shortest path.

279
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:39,580
So like you can assume that most of the objects in the universe are built in the shortest,

280
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,020
in the most efficient way.

281
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,540
Big leap I just took there.

282
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,900
Yeah, no, yes and no, because there are other things.

283
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,300
So in the limit, yes, because you want to tell the difference between things that have

284
00:17:53,300 --> 00:18:01,060
required a factory to build them and just random processes, but you can find instances

285
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:08,140
where the shortest path isn't taken for an individual object, an individual function.

286
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:11,460
And people go, ah, that means the shortest path isn't right.

287
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:17,700
And then I say, well, I don't know, I think it's right still because, so of course, because

288
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,500
there are other driving forces, it's not just one molecule.

289
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,300
Now when you start to, now you start to consider two objects, you have a joint assembly space

290
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:30,340
and it's not, now it's a compromise between not just making A and B in the shortest path.

291
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,380
You want to make A and B in the shortest path, which might mean that A is slightly longer,

292
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,380
you have compromise.

293
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,780
So when you see slightly more nesting in the construction, when you take a given object,

294
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,260
that can look longer, but that's because the overall function is the object is still trying

295
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,260
to be efficient.

296
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:48,780
Yeah.

297
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:55,500
And this is still very hand wavy and maybe have no legs to stand on, but we think we're

298
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,540
getting somewhere with that.

299
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,220
And there's probably some parallelization.

300
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,020
Yeah.

301
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,500
Right?

302
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,420
So this is all, this is not sequential.

303
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,220
The building is, I guess.

304
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:04,860
No, you're right.

305
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,500
When you're talking about complex objects, you don't have to work sequentially.

306
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:10,460
You can work in parallel.

307
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,060
You can get your friends together and they can.

308
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:12,300
Yeah.

309
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,460
The thing we're working on right now is how to understand these parallel processes.

310
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:22,300
Now there's a new thing we've introduced called assembly depth.

311
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,660
And assembly depth can be lower than the assembly index for a molecule when they're

312
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:33,500
cooperating together, because exactly this parallel processing is going on.

313
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,300
And my team have been working this out in the last few weeks because we're looking at

314
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:42,220
what compromises does nature need to make when it's making molecules in a cell?

315
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:50,940
And I wonder if, you know, I may be like, well, I'm always leaping out of my composites,

316
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,900
but in economics.

317
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm just wondering if you could apply this in the economic process.

318
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,620
It seems like capitalism is very good at finding shortest path, you know, every time.

319
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,820
But there are ludicrous things that happen because actually the cost function has been

320
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,940
minimized.

321
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,580
And so I keep seeing parallels everywhere where there are complex nested systems,

322
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,140
where if you give it enough time and you introduce a bit of heterogeneity,

323
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,700
the system readjusts and finds a new shortest path.

324
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,900
But the shortest path isn't fixed on just one molecule now.

325
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,740
It's in the actual existence of the object over time.

326
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,420
And that object could be a city, it could be a cell, it could be a factory.

327
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,020
But I think we're going way beyond molecules and my competence,
