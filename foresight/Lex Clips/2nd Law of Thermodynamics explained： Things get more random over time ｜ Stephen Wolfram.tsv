0	8240	You wrote the blog post, The 50 Year Quest, My Personal Journey, good title, My Personal
8240	10880	Journey with a Second Law, Thermodynamics.
10880	17960	So what is this law and what have you understood about it in the 50 year journey you had with
17960	18960	it?
18960	19960	Right.
19960	24040	So Second Law of Thermodynamics, sometimes called Law of Entropy increase, is this principle
24040	30240	of physics that says, well, my version of it would be things tend to get more random
30240	31240	over time.
31240	37200	A version of it that there are many different sort of formulations of it that are things
37200	42280	like heat doesn't spontaneously go from a hotter body to a colder one.
42280	50160	When you have mechanical work kind of gets dissipated into heat, you have friction and
50560	56160	when you systematically move things, eventually there'll be sort of the energy of moving things
56160	58920	gets kind of ground down into heat.
58920	65840	So people first sort of paid attention to this back in the 1820s when steam engines
65840	66840	were a big thing.
66840	71480	And the big question was, how efficient could a steam engine be?
71480	77280	And there's this chap called Sadiq Khanou, who was a French engineer, actually his father
77280	83480	was a sort of elaborate mathematical engineer in France.
83480	91760	But he figured out these kind of rules for how kind of the efficiency of the possible
91760	94880	efficiency of something like a steam engine.
94880	101920	And in sort of a side part of what he did was this idea that mechanical energy tends
101920	108520	to get dissipated as heat, that you end up going from sort of systematic mechanical motion
108520	110520	to this kind of random thing.
110520	112680	Well, at that time, nobody knew what heat was.
112680	118080	At that time, people thought that heat was a fluid, like they called it caloric, and
118080	123560	it was a fluid that kind of was absorbed into substances.
123560	130040	And when heat, when one hot thing would transfer heat to a colder thing, that this fluid would
130080	132320	flow from the hot thing to the colder thing.
132320	140680	But anyway, then by the 1860s, people had kind of come up with this idea that systematic
140680	150800	energy tends to degrade into kind of random heat that could then not be easily turned
150800	154400	back into systematic mechanical energy.
154720	159880	Then that quickly became sort of a global principle about how things work.
159880	162240	The question is, why does it happen that way?
162240	166240	So, you know, let's say you have a bunch of molecules in a box and they're arranged, these
166240	171000	molecules are arranged in a very nice sort of flotilla of molecules in one corner of
171000	172160	the box.
172160	176680	And then what you typically observe is that after a while, these molecules were kind of
176680	179320	randomly arranged in the box.
179320	181280	The question is, why does that happen?
181360	186920	And people for a long, long time tried to figure out, is there from the laws of mechanics
186920	190840	that just determine how these molecules, let's say these molecules like hard spheres bouncing
190840	195720	off each other, from the laws of mechanics that describe those molecules, can we explain
195720	204880	why it tends to be the case that we see things that are orderly sort of degrade into disorder?
204880	213120	We tend to see things that, you know, you scramble an egg, you take something that's
213120	216320	quite ordered and you disorder it, so to speak.
216320	220960	That's the thing that sort of happens quite regularly or you put some ink into water and
220960	227280	it will eventually spread out and fill up the water.
227280	232480	But you don't see those little particles of ink in the water all spontaneously kind of
232480	238040	arrange themselves into a big blob and then jump out of the water or something.
238040	243000	And so the question is, why do things happen in this kind of irreversible way where you
243000	245280	go from order to disorder?
245280	246880	Why does it happen that way?
246880	252360	And so throughout in the later part of the 1800s, a lot of work was done on trying to
252360	258120	figure out, can one derive this principle, this second law of thermodynamics, this law
258320	267520	about the dynamics of heat, so to speak, can one derive this from some fundamental principles
267520	268520	of mechanics?
268520	273080	In the laws of thermodynamics, the first law is basically the law of energy conservation
273080	278640	that the total energy associated with heat plus the total energy associated with mechanical
278640	282880	kinds of things plus other kinds of energy, that that total is constant.
282880	285320	And that became a pretty well understood principle.
285360	289120	But the second law of thermodynamics was always mysterious.
289120	290760	Like, why does it work this way?
290760	294880	Can it be derived from underlying mechanical laws?
294880	301960	And so when I was, well, 12 years old, actually, I had gotten interested, well, I'd been interested
301960	308080	in space and things like that because I thought that was kind of the future and interesting
308080	310080	sort of technology and so on.
310080	315200	And for a while, kind of, you know, every deep space probe was sort of a personal friend
315200	316200	type thing.
316200	322640	And I knew all kinds of characteristics of it and was kind of writing up all these things
322640	326920	when I was, well, I don't know, eight, nine, 10 years old and so on.
326920	330120	And then I got interested from being interested in kind of spacecraft.
330120	334640	I got interested in how do they work, what are all the instruments on them and so on.
334640	338440	And that got me interested in physics, which was just as well because if I'd stayed interested
338440	345240	in space in the, you know, mid to late 1960s, I would have had a long wait before, you know,
345240	348320	space really blossomed as an area.
348320	349720	Adding as everything.
349720	350720	Right.
350720	357080	I got interested in physics and then, well, the actual sort of detailed story is when
357080	361480	I kind of graduated from elementary school at age 12.
361480	368280	That's the time when in England where you finish elementary school, I sort of, my gift
368280	376080	sort of, I suppose, more or less for myself was I got this collection of physics books,
376080	382280	which was some college physics course of college physics books and volume five about statistical
382280	389840	physics and has this picture on the cover that shows a bunch of kind of idealized molecules
389840	395200	sitting in one side of a box and then it has a series of frames showing how these molecules
395200	397040	sort of spread out in the box.
397040	401280	And I thought, that's pretty interesting, you know, what causes that?
401280	406600	And you know, read the book and the book, the book actually, one of the things that was
406600	410520	really significant to me about that was the book kind of claimed, although I didn't really
410520	415440	understand what it said in detail, it kind of claimed that this sort of principle of
415440	418520	physics was derivable somehow.
418520	423960	And you know, other things I'd learned about physics, it was all like, it's a fact that
423960	425080	energy is conserved.
425120	431000	It's a fact that relativity works or something, not, it's something you can derive from some
431000	435720	fundamental sort of, it has to be that way as a matter of kind of mathematics or logic
435720	436720	or something.
436720	440800	So it was sort of interesting to me that there was a thing about physics that was kind of
440800	444040	inevitably true and derivable, so to speak.
444040	449680	And so I think that, so then I was like, there's a picture on this book and I was trying to
449680	450880	understand it.
450880	455680	And so that was actually the first serious program that I wrote for a computer was probably
455680	462280	1973, written for this computer, the size of a desk program with paper tape and so on.
462280	467240	And I tried to reproduce this picture on the book and it didn't succeed.
467240	468560	What was the failure mode there?
468560	469800	Like what do you mean it didn't succeed?
469800	470800	So it's a bunch of little-
470800	475280	It didn't look like, it didn't look like, okay, so what happened is, okay, many years
475280	478760	later I learned how the picture on the book was actually made and that it was actually
478760	482920	kind of a fake, but I didn't know that at that time.
482920	487440	But and that picture was actually a very high-tech thing when it was made in the beginning of
487440	492400	the 1960s, was made on the largest supercomputer that existed at the time.
492400	496760	And even so, it couldn't quite simulate the thing that it was supposed to be simulating.
496760	500320	But anyway, I didn't know that until many, many, many years later.
500320	505000	So at the time, it was like, you have these balls bouncing around in this box, but I was
505040	509680	using this computer with eight kilo words of memory, whatever, 18-bit words, memory words,
509680	510680	okay?
510680	515000	So it was whatever, 24 kilobytes of memory.
515000	521160	And it had these instructions, I probably still remember all of its machine instructions.
521160	525320	And it didn't really like dealing with floating point numbers or anything like that.
525320	530200	And so I had to simplify this model of particles bouncing around in the box.
530200	534960	And so I thought, well, I'll put them on a grid and I'll make the things just so that
535000	537880	they just sort of move one square at a time and so on.
537880	540600	And so I did the simulation.
540600	545480	And the result was it didn't look anything like the actual pictures on the book.
545480	552800	Now, many years later, in fact, very recently, I realized that the thing I'd simulated was
552800	558520	actually an example of a whole sort of computational irreducibility story that I absolutely did
558520	559760	not recognize at the time.
559760	563880	At the time, it just looked like it did something random and it looks wrong.
563920	567560	As opposed to it did something random and it's super interesting that it's random.
567560	570520	But I didn't recognize that at the time.
570520	576440	And so as it was at the time, I got interested in particle physics and I got interested in
576440	578480	other kinds of physics.
578480	582560	But this whole second law of thermodynamics thing, this idea that sort of orderly things
582560	587160	tend to degrade into disorder, continued to be something I was really interested in.
587160	592080	And I was really curious for the whole universe, why doesn't that happen all the time?
592160	596800	We start off in the big bang at the beginning of the universe was this thing that seems
596800	600440	like it's this very disordered collection of stuff.
600440	606400	And then it spontaneously forms itself into galaxies and creates all of this complexity
606400	608200	and order in the universe.
608200	610960	And so I was very curious how that happens.
610960	615720	But I was always kind of thinking, this is kind of somehow the second law of thermodynamics
615720	620920	is behind it trying to sort of pull things back into disorder, so to speak.
620920	623720	And how was order being created?
623720	629200	And so actually, I was interested, this is probably now 1980, I got interested in kind
629200	632400	of this galaxy formation and so on in the universe.
632400	635360	I also at that time was interested in neural networks.
635360	640680	And I was interested in kind of how brains make complicated things happen and so on.
640680	641680	Okay, wait, wait, wait.
641680	645880	What's the connection between the formation of galaxies and how brains make complicated
645880	646880	things happen?
646880	650400	Because they're both a matter of how complicated things come to happen.
650400	651960	Some simple origins.
651960	655400	Yeah, from some sort of known origins.
655400	661240	I had the sense that what I was interested in was kind of in all these different, this
661240	667440	sort of different cases of where complicated things were arising from rules.
667440	670960	And I also looked at snowflakes and things like that.
670960	673840	I was curious and fluid dynamics in general.
673840	676920	I was just sort of curious about how does complexity arise.
676920	683080	And the thing that I didn't, it took me a while to kind of realize that there might
683080	684480	be a general phenomenon.
684480	689040	I sort of assumed, oh, there's galaxies over here, there's brains over here, they're very
689040	690680	different kinds of things.
690680	695520	And so what happened, this is probably 1981 or so, I decided, okay, I'm going to try
695520	699360	and make the minimal model of how these things work.
699360	705080	And it was sort of an interesting experience because I had built, starting in 1979, I built
705080	709840	my first big computer system, I think called SMP, Symbolic Manipulation Program, it's kind
709840	714000	of a forerunner of modern or from language, with many of the same ideas about symbolic
714000	716320	computation and so on.
716320	721560	But the thing that was very important to me about that was, in building that language,
721560	727040	I had basically tried to figure out what were the relevant computational primitives, which
727040	731560	have turned out to stay with me for the last 40-something years.
731600	735840	But it was also important because in building a language, it was very different activity
735840	739880	from natural science, which is what I'd mostly done before, because in natural science, you
739880	743720	start from the phenomena of the world, and you try and figure out, so how can I make
743720	746280	sense of the phenomena of the world?
746280	750960	And kind of the world presents you with what it has to offer, so to speak, and you have
750960	752400	to make sense of it.
752400	759600	When you build a computer language or something, you are creating your own primitives, and
759640	762000	then you say, so what can you make from these?
762000	765080	Sort of the opposite way around from what you do in natural science.
765080	769000	But I'd had the experience of doing that, and so I was kind of like, okay, what happens
769000	771080	if you sort of make an artificial physics?
771080	775200	What happens if you just make up the rules by which systems operate?
775200	779360	And then I was thinking, for all these different systems, whether it was galaxies or brains
779360	784680	or whatever, what's the absolutely minimal model that kind of captures the things that
784680	786200	are important about those systems?
786200	788320	The computational primitives of that system.
788320	789320	Yes.
789400	793960	So that's what ended up with the cellular automata, where you just have a line of black
793960	799040	and white cells, and you just have a rule that says, given a cell and its neighbors,
799040	801960	what will the color of the cell be on the next step, and you just run it in a series
801960	803360	of steps.
803360	808120	And the sort of the ironic thing is that cellular automata are great models for many kinds of
808120	814440	things, but galaxies and brains are two examples where they do very, very badly.
814440	815880	They're really irrelevant to those two cases.
815920	819320	Is there a connection to the second law of thermodynamics and cellular automata?
819320	820320	Oh, yes.
820320	823760	The things you've discovered about cellular automata.
823760	824760	Yes.
824760	825760	Okay.
825760	829640	So when I first started cellular automata, my first papers about them were, you know,
829640	834160	the first sentence was always about the second law of thermodynamics, was always about how
834160	838560	does order manage to be produced even though there's a second law of thermodynamics which
838560	841080	tries to pull things back into disorder.
841080	846680	And I kind of, my early understanding of that had to do with these are intrinsically irreversible
846680	852600	processes in cellular automata that form, you know, can form orderly structures even
852600	854880	from random initial conditions.
854880	860160	But then what I realized, this was, well, actually, it's one of these things where it
860160	863800	was a discovery that I should have made earlier but didn't.
863800	868000	So you know, I had been studying cellular automata, what I did was the sort of most
868000	869520	obvious computer experiment.
869520	872320	You just try all the different rules and see what they do.
872320	875800	It's kind of like, you know, you've invented a computational telescope, you just pointed
875800	879720	at the most obvious thing in the sky and then you just see what's there.
879720	883760	And so I did that and I, you know, was making all these pictures of how cellular automata
883760	888760	work and starting these pictures, I studied in great detail, there was, you can number
888760	893120	the rules for cellular automata and one of them is, you know, rule 30.
893120	897240	So I made a picture of rule 30 back in 1981 or so.
897480	902200	Rule 30, well, it's, and I, at the time, I was just like, oh, okay, it's another one
902200	906680	of these rules, I don't really, it happens to be asymmetric, left, right, asymmetric.
906680	910240	And it's like, let me just consider the case of the symmetric ones, just to keep things
910240	912120	simpler, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
912120	913280	And I just kind of ignored it.
913920	922000	And then sort of in, actually, in 1984, strangely enough, I ended up having an early
922000	925400	laser printer, which made very high resolution pictures.
925400	928120	And I thought, I'm going to print out an interesting, you know, I want to make an
928120	928840	interesting picture.
928840	932960	Let me take this rule 30 thing and just make a high resolution picture of it.
933240	933800	I did.
934080	937560	And it's, it has this very remarkable property that its rule is very simple.
937840	942200	You started off just from one black cell at the top, and it makes this kind of triangular
942200	942760	pattern.
943200	946440	But if you look inside this pattern, it looks really random.
946880	951080	There's, you know, you look at the center column of cells and, you know, I studied
951080	952080	that in great detail.
952360	954720	And it's, so far as one can tell, it's completely random.
955400	958080	And it's kind of a little bit like digits of Pi.
958440	961640	Once you, you know, you know, the rule for generating the digits of Pi, but once
961640	966440	you've generated them, you know, 3.14159, et cetera, they seem completely random.
967040	971880	And in fact, I put up this prize back in, what was it, 2019 or something for prove
971960	974240	anything about the sequence, basically.
974280	976000	Has anyone been able to do anything on that?
976520	980760	People have sent me some things, but it's, you know, I don't know how hard these
980760	981400	problems are.
981400	987400	I mean, I, it's kind of spoiled because I, 2007, I put up a prize for determining
987400	992040	whether a particular Turing machine that I thought was the simplest candidate for
992040	996040	being a universal Turing machine, determine whether it is or isn't a universal Turing
996040	996480	machine.
996920	1000720	And somebody did a really good job of, of winning that prize, improving that it was
1000720	1003040	a universal Turing machine in about six months.
1003440	1006320	And so I, you know, I didn't know whether that would be one of these problems that was
1006320	1010400	out there for hundreds of years, or whether in this particular case, young chap called
1010440	1013640	Alex Smith, you know, nailed it in six months.
1013960	1018480	And so with this rule 30 collection, I don't really know whether these are things
1018480	1022160	that are a hundred years away from being able to, to get, or whether somebody's going
1022160	1023720	to come and do something very clever.
1023840	1028720	It's such a, I mean, it's like for Mars last year, but since rule 30, such a simple
1028720	1035080	formulation, it feels like anyone can look at it, understand it and feel like it's
1035080	1040440	within grasp to be able to predict something, to do, to, to derive some kind of law
1041320	1046000	that allows you to predict something about this middle column of rule 30.
1046160	1046480	Right.
1046920	1049120	But you know, this is, yet you can't.
1049360	1049920	Yeah, right.
1050080	1054640	This is the intuitional surprise of computational irreducibility and so on that
1054640	1058320	even though the rules are simple, you can't tell what's going to happen and you
1058320	1059640	can't prove things about it.
1060000	1066120	And I think so, so anyway, the thing, I started in 1984 or so, I started
1066120	1069680	realizing there's this phenomenon that you can have very simple rules.
1069680	1071520	They produce apparently random behavior.
1071880	1072200	Okay.
1072240	1076640	So that's a little bit like the second orthononomics because it's like you have
1076640	1081680	this simple initial condition, you can, you know, readily see that it's very, you
1081680	1083560	know, you can describe it very easily.
1083960	1087520	And yet it makes this thing that seems to be random.
1088160	1093560	Now, it turns out there's some technical detail about the second orthononomics and
1093560	1099200	about the idea of reversibility when you have a, if you have kind of a, a, a movie
1099480	1104560	of two, you know, billion balls colliding and you see them collide and they bounce
1104560	1109080	off and you run that movie in reverse, you can't tell which way was the forward
1109080	1111520	direction of time and which way was the backward direction of time.
1111720	1114640	When you're just looking at individual billion balls, by the time you've got a
1114640	1120120	whole collection of them, you know, a million of them or something, then it turns
1120120	1120880	out to be the case.
1120880	1126080	And this is the, the sort of the mystery of the second law that the orderly thing,
1126080	1130120	you start with the orderly thing and it becomes disordered and that's the forward
1130120	1131160	direction in time.
1131440	1135320	And the other way round of it starts disordered and becomes ordered, you just
1135320	1136840	don't see that in the world.
1137480	1143400	Now, in principle, if you, you know, if you sort of traced the detailed motions of
1143400	1149160	all those molecules backwards, you would be able to, it will, it will, the reverse
1149160	1154040	of time makes, you know, as you, as you go forwards in time, order goes to disorder.
1154080	1156400	As you go backwards in time, order goes to disorder.
1156480	1157520	Perfectly so, yes.
1157560	1157880	Right.
1158160	1164360	So the, the mystery is why is it the case that, or one version of the mystery is,
1164360	1169280	why is it the case that you never see something which happens to be just the kind
1169280	1173120	of disorder that you would need to somehow evolve to order?
1173320	1174600	Why does that not happen?
1174920	1178800	Why do you always just see order goes to disorder, not the other way round?
1179320	1184240	So the thing that I, I kind of realized, I started realizing in the 1980s is kind
1184240	1186480	of like, it's a bit like cryptography.
1186720	1191480	It's kind of like you start off from this, this key that's pretty simple and then you've
1191480	1195880	kind of run it and you can get this, you know, complicated random mess.
1196560	1205600	And the thing that, that, well, I sort of started realizing back then was that the
1205600	1209920	second law is kind of a, a, a story of computational reducibility.
1209960	1215240	It's a story of, you know, what seems, you know, what, what we can describe easily at
1215240	1221200	the beginning, we can only describe with a lot of computational effort at the end.
1221840	1230160	Okay, so now we come many, many years later and I was trying to sort of, well, having
1230160	1237760	done this big project to understand fundamental physics, I realized that sort of a key aspect
1237760	1240400	of that is understanding what observers are like.
1241040	1247160	And then I realized that the second law of thermodynamics is the same story as a bunch
1247200	1248240	of these other cases.
1249040	1255960	It is a story of a computationally bounded observer trying to observe a computationally
1255960	1257040	irreducible system.
1257520	1261960	So it's a story of, you know, underneath the molecules are bouncing around.
1262280	1267360	They're bouncing around in this completely determined way, determined by rules.
1268000	1276680	But the point is that, that we as computationally bounded observers can't tell that there were
1276680	1278480	these sort of simple underlying rules.
1278720	1280120	To us, it just looks random.
1280160	1286240	And when it comes to this question about, can you prepare the initial state so that, um, you
1286240	1291320	know, the disordered thing is, you know, how exactly the right disorder to make something
1291320	1294720	orderly, a computationally bounded observer cannot do that.
1295120	1299720	We'd have to have done all of this sort of irreducible computation to work out very
1299720	1305480	precisely what this disordered state, what the exact right disordered state is so that
1305480	1308280	we would get this ordered thing produced from it.
1308320	1311560	What does it mean to be computationally bounded observer?
1312240	1314840	So observing a computationally irreducible system.
1314840	1318600	So the computationally bounded, is there something formal you can say there?
1318680	1319000	Right.
1319000	1323320	So it means, okay, you can, you can talk about Turing machines.
1323320	1329280	You can talk about computational complexity theory and, uh, you know, uh, polynomial
1329280	1330960	time computation and things like this.
1331160	1335200	There are a variety of ways to make something more precise, but I think it's more useful.
1335200	1340520	The intuitive version of it is more useful, which is basically just to say that, you
1340520	1345080	know, how much computation are you going to do to try and work out what's going on?
1345440	1350040	And the answer is you're not allowed to do a lot of, we're not able to do a lot of
1350040	1355680	computation when we, you know, we've got, you know, in this room, there will be a
1355680	1358520	trillion, trillion, trillion molecules, a little bit less.
1358960	1359600	It's a big room.
1360360	1360760	Right.
1361120	1366680	And, uh, you know, at every moment, you know, there, every microsecond or something,
1366680	1371960	these molecules, molecules are colliding and that's a lot of computation that's
1371960	1372600	getting done.
1373040	1379120	And the question is in our brains, we do a lot less computation every second than the
1379120	1380960	computation done by all those molecules.
1381520	1387400	If there is computational irreducibility, we can't work out in detail what all those
1387400	1388520	molecules are going to do.
1388880	1392080	What we can do is only a much smaller amount of computation.
1392600	1397640	And so the, the second law of thermodynamics is this kind of interplay between the
1397640	1403000	underlying computational irreducibility and the fact that we as preparers of initial
1403000	1408640	states or as measures of what happens are, you know, are not capable of doing that much
1408640	1409200	computation.
1409200	1414840	So to us, another big formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is this idea of
1414840	1416240	the law of entropy increase.
1416640	1420880	The characteristic that this universe, the entropy seems to be always increasing.
1421360	1423280	What does that show to you about the evolution of?
1424240	1424800	Well, okay.
1424800	1427840	So, so first of all, we have to say that entropy is, okay.
1428280	1433760	And that's very confused in the history of thermodynamics because entropy was first
1433760	1439280	introduced by a guy called Rudolf Clausius and he did it in terms of heat and temperature.
1439760	1440080	Okay.
1440400	1444000	Subsequently, it was reformulated by a guy called Ludwig Boltzmann.
1445200	1450480	And he formulated it in a much more kind of combinatorial type way.
1451120	1455200	But he always claimed that it was equivalent to Clausius's thing.
1455200	1460160	And in one particular simple example it is, but that connection between these two
1460160	1462880	formulations of entropy, they've never been connected.
1463440	1468000	I mean, there's really, so, okay, so the more general definition of entropy due to
1468000	1470480	Boltzmann is the following thing.
1470480	1474080	So you say, I have a system and it has many possible configurations.
1474080	1477200	The molecules can be in many different arrangements, etc., etc., etc.
1477920	1482880	If we know something about the system, for example, we know it's in a box,
1482880	1487280	it has a certain pressure, it has a certain temperature, we know these overall facts about it.
1487280	1491200	Then we say, how many microscopic configurations of the system
1491840	1494000	are possible given those overall constraints?
1494320	1498240	And the entropy is the logarithm of that number.
1498800	1499760	That's the definition.
1500320	1504800	And that's the kind of the general definition of entropy that turns out to be useful.
1504800	1509200	Now, in Boltzmann's time, he thought these molecules could be placed anywhere you want.
1510880	1516640	But he said, oh, actually, we can make it a lot simpler by having the molecules be discrete.
1516640	1518880	Well, actually, he didn't know molecules existed.
1519360	1526640	And in his time, 1860s and so on, the idea that matter might be made of discrete stuff
1527200	1529760	had been floated ever since ancient Greek times.
1529760	1534400	But it had been a long time debate about, is matter discrete, is it continuous?
1534960	1540640	At the moment at that time, people mostly thought that matter was continuous.
1541360	1545920	And it was all confused with this question about what heat is, and people thought heat was this
1545920	1554880	fluid. And it was a big, big muddle. And this Boltzmann said, let's assume there are discrete
1554880	1560080	molecules. Let's even assume they have discrete energy levels. Let's say everything is discrete.
1560080	1565040	Then we can do sort of combinatorial mathematics and work out how many configurations of these
1565040	1569600	things there will be in the box. And we can say we can compute this entropy quantity.
1570560	1573840	But he said, but of course, it's just a fiction that these things are discrete.
1573920	1579840	So he said, this is an interesting piece of history, by the way, that at that time,
1579840	1583840	people didn't know molecules existed. There were other hints from looking at
1584480	1588560	kind of chemistry that there might be discrete atoms and so on, just from the
1588560	1595040	combinatorics of two hydrogens and one oxygen make water, two amounts of hydrogen plus one
1595040	1600160	amount of oxygen together make water, things like this. But it wasn't known that discrete
1600160	1610400	molecules existed. And in fact, the people, it wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century
1610400	1615360	that Brownian motion was the final giveaway. Brownian motion is, you look under a microscope at
1615360	1620480	these little pieces from pollen grains, you see they're being discreetly kicked. And those kicks
1620480	1627040	are water molecules hitting them and they're discrete. And in fact, it was really quite
1627120	1632240	interesting history. I mean, Boltzmann had worked out how things could be discrete and
1632240	1638480	have basically invented something like quantum theory in the 1860s. But he just thought it
1638480	1643440	wasn't really the way it worked. And then just a piece of physics history, because I think it's
1643440	1649120	kind of interesting. In 1900, this guy called Max Planck, who'd been a longtime thermodynamics
1649120	1652800	person who was trying to, everybody was trying to prove the second law of thermodynamics,
1652800	1658400	including Max Planck. And Max Planck believed that radiation, like electromagnetic radiation,
1658400	1662720	somehow the interaction of that with matter was going to prove the second law of thermodynamics.
1663360	1667680	But he had these experiments that people had done on black body radiation,
1667680	1673360	and they were these curves. And you couldn't fit the curves based on his idea for how
1673360	1678000	radiation interacted with matter, those curves, you couldn't figure out how to fit those curves.
1678640	1684400	Except he noticed that if he just did what Boltzmann had done and assumed that
1684400	1691360	electromagnetic radiation was discrete, he could fit the curves. But this just happens to work this
1691360	1697440	way. Then Einstein came along and said, well, by the way, the electromagnetic field might
1697440	1703200	actually be discrete. It might be made of photons. And then that explains how this all works. And
1703280	1711600	that was in 1905, that was how that piece of quantum mechanics got started.
1711600	1715600	Kind of interesting, interesting piece of history. I didn't know until I was researching this recently.
1716160	1723280	In 1904 and 1903, Einstein wrote three different papers. And so just sort of
1724240	1729360	well-known physics history. In 1905, Einstein wrote these three papers, one introduced relativity
1729360	1738560	theory, one explained Brownian motion and one introduced basically photons. So kind of a big
1738560	1744640	deal year for physics and for Einstein. But in the years before that, he'd written several papers,
1744640	1748160	and what were they about? They were about the second law of thermodynamics. And they were
1748160	1754560	an attempt to prove the second law of thermodynamics and their nonsense. And so I had no idea that
1754560	1761440	he'd done this. Interesting. Neither. And in fact, what he did, those three papers in 1905, well,
1761440	1765680	not so much the relativity paper, the one on Brownian motion, the one on photons,
1765680	1772320	both of these were about the story of sort of making the world discrete. And then he got
1772320	1777600	those like that idea from Boltzmann. But Boltzmann didn't think, you know, Boltzmann kind of died
1777600	1782720	believing, you know, he said, he has a quote actually, you know, in the end, things are going
1782720	1786320	to turn out to be discrete. And I'm going to write down what I have to say about this because,
1787600	1791120	you know, eventually, this stuff will be rediscovered and I want to leave, you know,
1791120	1796400	what I can about how things are going to be discrete. But, you know, I think he has some
1796400	1803840	quote about how, you know, one person can't stand against the tide of history in saying that,
1803840	1809440	you know, matter is discrete. Oh, so he's stuck by his guns in terms of matter is discrete.
1809440	1815920	Yes, he did. And the, you know, what's interesting about this is, at the time,
1815920	1819280	everybody, including Einstein kind of assumed that space was probably going to end up being
1819280	1823280	discrete too. But that didn't work out technically because it wasn't consistent with
1823280	1828640	relativity theory, it didn't seem to be. And so then in the history of physics, even though
1828640	1835600	people had determined that matter was discrete, electromagnetic field was discrete, space was
1835680	1841440	a holdout of not being discrete. And in fact, Einstein, 1916, has this nice letter he wrote,
1841440	1845600	where he says, in the end, it will turn out space is discrete, but we don't have the mathematical
1845600	1851760	tools necessary to figure out how that works yet. And so, you know, I think it's kind of cool that
1851760	1857760	a hundred years later we do. Yes, for you, you're pretty sure that at every layer of reality,
1857760	1863920	it's discrete. Right. And that space is discrete. And that the, I mean, and in fact, one of the
1863920	1871600	things I realized recently is this kind of theory of heat, that the, you know, that heat is really
1871600	1878640	this continuous fluid, it's kind of like the, you know, the caloric theory of heat, which turns
1878640	1882880	out to be completely wrong, because actually, heat is the motion of discrete molecules,
1882880	1886640	unless you know there are discrete molecules, it's hard to understand what heat could possibly be.
1887360	1893520	Well, you know, I think space is discrete. And the question is kind of what's the analog
1893520	1901680	of the mistake that was made with caloric in the case of space. And so, my current guess
1901680	1909040	is that dark matter is, as I've, my little sort of aphorism of the last few months has been,
1909040	1915040	you know, dark matter is the caloric of our time. That is, it will turn out that dark matter is a
1915040	1920800	feature of space. And it is not a bunch of particles. You know, at the time when, when people
1920800	1924800	were talking about heat, they knew about fluids. And they said, well, heat must be just be another
1924800	1929120	kind of fluid, because that's what they knew about. But now people know about particles. And so,
1929120	1933600	they say, well, what's dark matter? It's not, it's not, it just must be particles.
1933600	1936480	So what could dark matter be as a feature of space?
1936480	1941440	Oh, I don't know yet. I mean, I think the, the thing I'm really one of the things I'm hoping
1941440	1947440	to be able to do is to find the analog of Brownian motion in space. So, in other words, Brownian
1947440	1953040	motion was, was seeing down to the level of an effect from individual molecules. And so,
1953040	1957600	in the case of space, you know, most of the things, the things we see about space so far,
1957600	1962400	just everything seems continuous. Brownian motion had been discovered in the 1830s.
1962400	1968640	And it was only identified what it was, what it was the, the, the result of by Smoluchowski
1968640	1974320	and Einstein at the beginning of the 20th century. And, you know, dark matter was, was discovered,
1974320	1979280	that phenomenon was discovered 100 years ago. You know, the rotation curves of galaxies don't
1979280	1984880	follow the luminous matter that was discovered 100 years ago. And I think, you know, that I
1984880	1990320	wouldn't be surprised if there isn't an effect that we already know about that is kind of the
1990320	1995680	analog of Brownian motion that reveals the discreteness of space. And in fact, we're beginning
1995680	2000800	to have some guesses, we have some, some evidence that black hole mergers work differently when
2000800	2005760	there's discrete space. And there may be things that you can see in gravitational wave signatures
2005760	2011600	and things associated with the discreteness of space. But this is kind of, for me, it's kind of,
2011600	2015040	it's kind of interesting to see this sort of recapitulation of the history of physics,
2015600	2021440	where people, you know, vehemently say, you know, matter is continuous, electromagnetic field is
2021520	2026240	continuous. And turns out it isn't true. And then they say space is continuous. But, but so,
2026240	2030560	you know, entropy is the number of states of the system consistent with some constraint.
2030560	2037600	Yes. And the thing is that if you have, if you know in great detail the position of every molecule
2037600	2045200	in the gas, the entropy is, is always zero, because there's only one possible state. The,
2045200	2049440	the configuration of molecules in the gas, the molecules bounce around, they have a certain
2049440	2054800	rule for bouncing around. There's just one state of the gas evolves to one state of the gas and so
2054800	2060640	on. But it's only if you don't know in detail where all the molecules are, that you can say,
2060640	2065440	well, the entropy increases, because the things we do know about the molecules, there are more
2065440	2069600	possible microscopic states of the system consistent with what we do know about where the
2069600	2077200	molecules are. And so the question of whether, so people, this sort of paradox in a sense of,
2077200	2081360	oh, if we knew where all the molecules where the entropy wouldn't increase, there was this idea
2081360	2088320	introduced by, by Gibbs in the early 20th century, well, actually the very beginning of the 20th
2088320	2093760	century, as a physics professor, an American physics professor was sort of the first distinguished
2093760	2102160	American physics professor at Yale. And he introduced this idea of coarse-graining, this idea that,
2102160	2106320	well, you know, these molecules have a detailed way they're bouncing around, but we can only
2106320	2112000	observe a coarse-grained version of that. But the confusion has been nobody knew what a valid
2112000	2117040	coarse-graining would be. So nobody knew that whether you could have this coarse-graining that
2117040	2125200	very carefully was sculpted in just such a way that it would notice that the particular configurations
2125200	2129200	that you could get from the simple initial condition, you know, they fit into this coarse-graining,
2129200	2135520	and the coarse-graining very carefully observes that. Why can't you do that kind of very detailed,
2135520	2141040	precise coarse-graining? The answer is, because if you are a computationally bounded observer,
2141040	2146720	and the underlying dynamics is computationally irreducible, that's, that's what defines possible
2146720	2153120	coarse-graining is what a computationally bounded observer can do. And it's the, it's the fact that
2153120	2160960	a computationally bounded observer is, is forced to look only at this kind of coarse-grained version
2160960	2167360	of what the system is doing. That's why, and because the, what's, what's going on underneath
2167360	2174080	is it's kind of filling out this, this, the different possible, you're ending up with something where
2175360	2185280	the sort of underlying computational irreducibility is your, if all you can see is what the
2185360	2189760	coarse-grained result is with compute, with a sort of computationally bounded observation,
2190400	2196480	then inevitably there are many possible underlying configurations that are consistent with that.
2196480	2201600	Just to clarify, basically any observer that exists inside the universe
2202640	2207360	is going to be computationally bounded. No, any observer like us. I don't know, I can't imagine.
2207360	2210400	When you say like us, what do you mean, what do you mean like us?
2211120	2216800	Well, humans with finite minds. You're including the tools of science.
2216800	2223440	Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and, and, and as we, you know, we have more precise, and by the way,
2223440	2227520	there are little sort of microscopic violations of the second law of thermodynamics
2227520	2231760	that you can start to have when you have more precise measurements of where precisely molecules
2231760	2238960	are. But for, for a large scale, when you have enough molecules, we don't have, you know, we're
2238960	2244000	not tracing all those molecules and we just don't have the computational resources to do that.
2244000	2251440	And it wouldn't be, you know, I think that the, to imagine what an observer who is not
2251440	2256720	computationally bounded would be like. It's an interesting thing because, okay, so what does
2256720	2261920	computational boundedness mean? Among other things, it means we conclude that definite things happen.
2262480	2267520	We go, we take all this complexity of the world and we make a decision. We're going to turn left
2267600	2277040	or turn right. And that is kind of reducing all this kind of detail into we're observing it,
2277040	2282080	we're, we're, we're sort of crushing it down to this, this one thing. Yeah. And, and that,
2282080	2287760	if we didn't do that, we wouldn't, we wouldn't have all this sort of symbolic structure that we
2287760	2294400	build up that lets us think things through with our finite minds. We'd be instead, you know,
2294400	2300560	we'd be just, we'd be sort of one with the universe. Yeah. So content to not simplify.
2301200	2308640	Yes. If we didn't simplify, then we wouldn't be like us. We would be like the universe, like
2308640	2314400	the, the intrinsic universe, but not having experiences like the experiences we have,
2314400	2320240	where we, for example, conclude that definite things happen. We, you know, we, we sort of have
2320320	2327200	this, this notion of being able to make, make sort of narrative statements. Yeah. I wonder if
2327200	2332160	it's just like you imagined as a thought experiment, what it's like to be a computer. I wonder if it's
2332160	2338640	possible to try to begin to imagine what it's like to be an unbounded computational observer.
2338640	2343840	Well, okay. So here's, here's how that I think plays out. Vibrations.
2344400	2350560	Yeah. So, I mean, in this, we talk about this Ruliad, this spaceable possible computations.
2350560	2356400	Yes. And this idea of, you know, being at a certain place in the Ruliad, which corresponds to sort
2356400	2363040	of a certain way of, of rep, of a certain set of computations that you are representing things in
2363040	2370400	terms of. Okay. So as you expand out in the Ruliad, as you kind of encompass more possible
2370480	2375200	views of the universe, as you encompass more possible kinds of computations that you can do,
2375760	2379680	eventually you might say, that's a real win. You know, we're, we're colonizing the Ruliad.
2379680	2384080	We're, we're, we're building out more paradigms about how to think about things.
2384080	2389520	And eventually you might say, we, we, we won all the way. We managed to colonize the whole Ruliad.
2389520	2395200	Okay. Here's the problem with that. The problem is that the notion of existence, coherent existence
2396000	2400240	requires some kind of specialization. By the time you are the whole Ruliad,
2400240	2405120	by the time you cover the whole Ruliad, in no useful sense do you coherently exist.
2405840	2413600	So in other words, in, in the notion of existence, the notion of what we think of as, as, as definite
2413600	2420880	existence requires this kind of specialization, requires this kind of idea that we are, we are not
2421680	2427600	all possible things. We are the, a particular set of things. And that's kind of how we,
2428240	2433760	that that's kind of what, what makes us have a coherent existence. If we were spread throughout
2433760	2439280	the Ruliad, we would not, there would be no coherence to the way that we work. We would work
2439280	2445120	in all possible ways. And that wouldn't be kind of a notion of identity. We wouldn't have this
2445120	2454000	notion of kind of, of, of, of coherent identity. I am geographically located somewhere exactly
2454000	2460240	precisely in the Ruliad. Therefore, I am. Yes. Yeah, yeah, right. Well, you're in a certain
2460240	2466080	place in physical space, you're in a certain place in rural space. And if, if you are, if you are
2466080	2473680	sufficiently spread out, you are no longer coherent. And you no longer have, I mean, in the,
2473680	2478640	in our perception of what it means to exist and to have experience, it doesn't happen that way.
2478640	2482400	So therefore, so to exist means to be computationally bounded.
2483120	2488000	I think so. To exist in the way that we think of ourselves as existing. Yes.
2488000	2493040	The very act of existence is like operating in this place that's computationally reducible.
2493040	2496480	So there's this giant mess of things going on that you can't possibly predict.
2497280	2499280	But nevertheless, because of your limitations,
2499840	2506480	you have an imperative of like, what is it, an imperative or a skill set to simplify,
2506480	2510720	or an ignorance, a sufficient level. Okay. So the thing which is not obvious is that
2510720	2515600	you are taking a slice of all this complexity, just like we have all of these molecules bouncing
2515600	2520640	around in the room. But all we notice is, you know, the, the, the kind of the flow of the air
2520640	2526960	or the pressure of the air, we're just noticing these particular things. And the, the big
2527040	2532720	interesting thing is that there are rules, there are laws that govern those big things that we,
2532720	2536640	we observe. So it's not obvious. That's amazing. Because it doesn't feel like it's a slice.
2537280	2541680	Yeah. Well, right. It's not a slice. It's like a, it's like an abstraction.
2542560	2547120	Yes. But, but I mean, the fact that the gas laws work, that we can describe pressure,
2547120	2551760	volume, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and we don't have to go down to the level of talking
2551760	2557440	about individual molecules, that is a non-trivial fact. And, and here's the thing that I sort of
2557440	2563840	exciting thing as far as I'm concerned, the fact that there are certain aspects of the universe.
2563840	2568720	So, you know, we think space is made ultimately these atoms of space and these hypergraphs and so
2568720	2576800	on. And we think that, but we nevertheless perceive the universe at a large scale to be like continuous
2576800	2583600	space and so on. We, in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time,
2583600	2589920	these many threads of history, yet we kind of span. So, so, you know, in quantum mechanics,
2589920	2596320	in our models of physics, there are these, time is not a single thread. Time breaks into many
2596320	2603120	threads. They branch, they merge. And, but we are part of that branching, merging universe.
2603760	2609280	And so, our brains are also branching and merging. And so, when we perceive the universe,
2609920	2617040	we are branching brains perceiving a branching universe. And so, the fact that the claim that we
2618880	2623520	believe that we are persistent in time, we have this single thread of experience,
2623520	2629040	that's the statement that somehow we managed to aggregate together those separate threads of time
2629040	2633120	that are separated in the operation of, in the fundamental operation of the universe.
2633120	2638400	So, just as in space, we're averaging over some big region of space and we're looking at many,
2638400	2643680	many of the aggregate effects of many atoms of space. So, similarly, in what we call branchial
2643680	2649280	space, the space of these, these quantum branches, we are effectively averaging over many different
2649280	2655840	branches of possible of histories of the universe. And so, and in thermodynamics,
2655840	2661120	we're averaging over many configurations of, you know, many, many possible positions of molecules.
2661760	2666880	So, what we see here is that the question is, when you do that averaging for space,
2666880	2671120	what are the aggregate laws of space? When you do that averaging over branchial space,
2671120	2676960	what are the aggregate laws of branchial space? When you do that averaging over the molecules
2676960	2683120	and so on, what are the aggregate laws you get? And this is, this is the thing that I think is just
2683600	2688560	amazingly, amazingly neat. Is that, that there are aggregate laws at all?
2688560	2693280	Well, yes, but the question is, what are those aggregate laws? So, the answer is for space,
2693280	2696960	the aggregate laws, Einstein's equations for gravity for the structure of spacetime,
2697600	2704160	for branchial space, the aggregate laws are the laws of quantum mechanics. And for the case of,
2704160	2709200	of molecules and things, the aggregate laws are basically the second law of thermodynamics.
2709920	2714560	And so, the, that's the, and the things that follow from the second law of thermodynamics.
2715120	2721280	And so, what that means is that the three great theories of 20th century physics,
2721280	2725600	which are basically general relativity, the theory of gravity, quantum mechanics,
2725600	2729520	and statistical mechanics, which is what kind of grows out of the second law of thermodynamics,
2730240	2736640	all three of the great theories of 20th century physics are the result of this interplay between
2736640	2742960	computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness of observers. And, you know, for me,
2743680	2749440	this is really neat because it means that all three of these laws are derivable.
2749440	2754400	So, we used to think that, for example, Einstein's equations were just sort of a wheel-in feature
2754400	2758880	of our universe, that they could be in my universe, might be that way, it might not be that way,
2759440	2764080	quantum mechanics is just like, well, it just happens to be that way. And the second law,
2764080	2768640	people had kind of thought, well, maybe it is derivable. Okay. What turns out to be the case
2768640	2773680	is that all three of the fundamental principles of physics are derivable, but they're not derivable
2773680	2779840	just from mathematics. They require, or just from some kind of logic or computation, they require
2779840	2785840	one more thing. They require that the observer, that the thing that is sampling the way the
2785840	2791040	universe works, is an observer who has these characteristics of computational boundedness
2791120	2797120	of belief and persistence and time. And so, that means that it is the nature of the observer,
2798560	2802880	you know, the rough nature of the observer, not the details of where we got two eyes and we
2802880	2809280	observed photons of this frequency and so on. But the kind of the very course features of the
2809280	2817200	observer then imply these very precise facts about physics. And I think it's amazing.
2817200	2823600	So, if we just look at the actual experience of the observer that we experience this reality,
2823600	2829360	it seems real to us. And you're saying because of our bounded nature, it's actually all an illusion.
2830400	2834080	It's a simplification. Well, yeah, it's a simplification. Right. What's, what's
2834080	2839040	So, you don't think a simplification is an illusion? No, I mean, it's, it's, well,
2839760	2845120	I don't know. I mean, what's underneath? Okay, that's an interesting question.
2845520	2851760	What's real? And that relates to the whole question of why does the universe exist? And,
2852320	2858160	you know, what is the difference between reality and a mere representation of what's going on?
2858160	2861040	Yes. We experience the representation.
2861760	2869840	Yes. But the, the question of, so, so one question is, you know, why is there a thing
2869840	2876720	which we can experience that way? And the answer is, because this Rulliard object,
2877360	2883760	which is this entangled limit of all possible computations, there is no choice about it. It
2883760	2889920	has to exist. It has to, there has to be such a thing. It is in the same sense that, you know,
2889920	2895280	two plus two, if you define what two is and you plot pluses and so on, two plus two has to equal
2895280	2901280	four. Similarly, this Rulliard, this limit of all possible computations, just has to be a thing
2901280	2906880	you, that is, once you have the idea of computation, you inevitably have the Rulliard.
2906880	2908320	You're going to have to have a Rulliard, yeah.
2908320	2913200	Right. And what's important about it, there's just one of it. It's, it's, it's just this unique
2913200	2923920	object. And that unique object necessarily exists. And then the question is, what, and then we are,
2923920	2929360	once, once you know that we are sort of embedded in that and taking samples of it,
2929360	2935520	that it's sort of inevitable that there is this thing that we can perceive that is, you know,
2935520	2944400	that our perception of kind of physical reality necessarily is that way, given that we are observers
2944400	2950240	with the characteristics we have. So in other words, the fact that, the fact that the universe
2950240	2956080	exists is, it's actually, it's almost like it's, you know, to think about it almost
2956080	2962000	theologically, so to speak. And I've really, it's funny because a lot of the questions about
2962000	2967840	the existence of the universe and so on, they transcend what kind of the science of the last
2967840	2971360	few hundred years has really been concerned with. The science of the last few hundred years
2971360	2977440	hasn't thought it could talk about questions like that. And, but I think it's kind of, and so a lot
2977520	2983120	of the kind of arguments of, you know, does God exist? You know, is it obvious that I think it,
2983120	2989920	in some sense, in some representation, it's sort of more obvious that something sort of
2989920	2997120	bigger than us exists than that we exist. And we are, you know, our existence and as observers,
2997120	3002480	the way we are is sort of a contingent thing about the universe. And it's more inevitable that the
3003200	3009200	whole universe, kind of the whole set of all possibilities exists. But this question about,
3009200	3015840	you know, is it real or is it an illusion? You know, all we know is our experience.
3016720	3025600	And so the fact that, well, our experience is this absolutely microscopic piece of sample
3025680	3033360	of the Ruliad. And we're, and, you know, there's this point about, you know, we might sample more
3033360	3037440	and more of the Ruliad, we might learn more and more about, we might learn, you know, like, like
3038080	3044720	different areas of physics, like quantum mechanics, for example, the fact that it was discovered,
3044720	3049440	I think, is closely related to the fact that electronic amplifiers were invented that allowed
3049440	3054160	you to take a small effect and amplify it up, which hadn't been possible before. You know,
3054160	3059440	microscopes have been invented that magnify things and so on. But, you know, having a very small
3059440	3064160	effect and being able to magnify it was sort of a new thing that allowed one to see a different
3064160	3068800	sort of aspect of the universe and let one discover this kind of thing. So, you know,
3068800	3074560	we can expect that in the Ruliad, there are an infinite collection of new things we can discover.
3074560	3079520	There's, in fact, computational irreducibility kind of guarantees that there will be an infinite
3079600	3083920	collection of kind of, you know, pockets of reducibility that can be discovered.
3085760	3091200	Boy, would it be fun to take a walk down the Ruliad and see what kind of stuff we find there.
