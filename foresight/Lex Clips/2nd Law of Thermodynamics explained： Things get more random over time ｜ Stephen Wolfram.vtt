00:00.000 --> 00:08.240
You wrote the blog post, The 50 Year Quest, My Personal Journey, good title, My Personal

00:08.240 --> 00:10.880
Journey with a Second Law, Thermodynamics.

00:10.880 --> 00:17.960
So what is this law and what have you understood about it in the 50 year journey you had with

00:17.960 --> 00:18.960
it?

00:18.960 --> 00:19.960
Right.

00:19.960 --> 00:24.040
So Second Law of Thermodynamics, sometimes called Law of Entropy increase, is this principle

00:24.040 --> 00:30.240
of physics that says, well, my version of it would be things tend to get more random

00:30.240 --> 00:31.240
over time.

00:31.240 --> 00:37.200
A version of it that there are many different sort of formulations of it that are things

00:37.200 --> 00:42.280
like heat doesn't spontaneously go from a hotter body to a colder one.

00:42.280 --> 00:50.160
When you have mechanical work kind of gets dissipated into heat, you have friction and

00:50.560 --> 00:56.160
when you systematically move things, eventually there'll be sort of the energy of moving things

00:56.160 --> 00:58.920
gets kind of ground down into heat.

00:58.920 --> 01:05.840
So people first sort of paid attention to this back in the 1820s when steam engines

01:05.840 --> 01:06.840
were a big thing.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.480
And the big question was, how efficient could a steam engine be?

01:11.480 --> 01:17.280
And there's this chap called Sadiq Khanou, who was a French engineer, actually his father

01:17.280 --> 01:23.480
was a sort of elaborate mathematical engineer in France.

01:23.480 --> 01:31.760
But he figured out these kind of rules for how kind of the efficiency of the possible

01:31.760 --> 01:34.880
efficiency of something like a steam engine.

01:34.880 --> 01:41.920
And in sort of a side part of what he did was this idea that mechanical energy tends

01:41.920 --> 01:48.520
to get dissipated as heat, that you end up going from sort of systematic mechanical motion

01:48.520 --> 01:50.520
to this kind of random thing.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.680
Well, at that time, nobody knew what heat was.

01:52.680 --> 01:58.080
At that time, people thought that heat was a fluid, like they called it caloric, and

01:58.080 --> 02:03.560
it was a fluid that kind of was absorbed into substances.

02:03.560 --> 02:10.040
And when heat, when one hot thing would transfer heat to a colder thing, that this fluid would

02:10.080 --> 02:12.320
flow from the hot thing to the colder thing.

02:12.320 --> 02:20.680
But anyway, then by the 1860s, people had kind of come up with this idea that systematic

02:20.680 --> 02:30.800
energy tends to degrade into kind of random heat that could then not be easily turned

02:30.800 --> 02:34.400
back into systematic mechanical energy.

02:34.720 --> 02:39.880
Then that quickly became sort of a global principle about how things work.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.240
The question is, why does it happen that way?

02:42.240 --> 02:46.240
So, you know, let's say you have a bunch of molecules in a box and they're arranged, these

02:46.240 --> 02:51.000
molecules are arranged in a very nice sort of flotilla of molecules in one corner of

02:51.000 --> 02:52.160
the box.

02:52.160 --> 02:56.680
And then what you typically observe is that after a while, these molecules were kind of

02:56.680 --> 02:59.320
randomly arranged in the box.

02:59.320 --> 03:01.280
The question is, why does that happen?

03:01.360 --> 03:06.920
And people for a long, long time tried to figure out, is there from the laws of mechanics

03:06.920 --> 03:10.840
that just determine how these molecules, let's say these molecules like hard spheres bouncing

03:10.840 --> 03:15.720
off each other, from the laws of mechanics that describe those molecules, can we explain

03:15.720 --> 03:24.880
why it tends to be the case that we see things that are orderly sort of degrade into disorder?

03:24.880 --> 03:33.120
We tend to see things that, you know, you scramble an egg, you take something that's

03:33.120 --> 03:36.320
quite ordered and you disorder it, so to speak.

03:36.320 --> 03:40.960
That's the thing that sort of happens quite regularly or you put some ink into water and

03:40.960 --> 03:47.280
it will eventually spread out and fill up the water.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.480
But you don't see those little particles of ink in the water all spontaneously kind of

03:52.480 --> 03:58.040
arrange themselves into a big blob and then jump out of the water or something.

03:58.040 --> 04:03.000
And so the question is, why do things happen in this kind of irreversible way where you

04:03.000 --> 04:05.280
go from order to disorder?

04:05.280 --> 04:06.880
Why does it happen that way?

04:06.880 --> 04:12.360
And so throughout in the later part of the 1800s, a lot of work was done on trying to

04:12.360 --> 04:18.120
figure out, can one derive this principle, this second law of thermodynamics, this law

04:18.320 --> 04:27.520
about the dynamics of heat, so to speak, can one derive this from some fundamental principles

04:27.520 --> 04:28.520
of mechanics?

04:28.520 --> 04:33.080
In the laws of thermodynamics, the first law is basically the law of energy conservation

04:33.080 --> 04:38.640
that the total energy associated with heat plus the total energy associated with mechanical

04:38.640 --> 04:42.880
kinds of things plus other kinds of energy, that that total is constant.

04:42.880 --> 04:45.320
And that became a pretty well understood principle.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.120
But the second law of thermodynamics was always mysterious.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.760
Like, why does it work this way?

04:50.760 --> 04:54.880
Can it be derived from underlying mechanical laws?

04:54.880 --> 05:01.960
And so when I was, well, 12 years old, actually, I had gotten interested, well, I'd been interested

05:01.960 --> 05:08.080
in space and things like that because I thought that was kind of the future and interesting

05:08.080 --> 05:10.080
sort of technology and so on.

05:10.080 --> 05:15.200
And for a while, kind of, you know, every deep space probe was sort of a personal friend

05:15.200 --> 05:16.200
type thing.

05:16.200 --> 05:22.640
And I knew all kinds of characteristics of it and was kind of writing up all these things

05:22.640 --> 05:26.920
when I was, well, I don't know, eight, nine, 10 years old and so on.

05:26.920 --> 05:30.120
And then I got interested from being interested in kind of spacecraft.

05:30.120 --> 05:34.640
I got interested in how do they work, what are all the instruments on them and so on.

05:34.640 --> 05:38.440
And that got me interested in physics, which was just as well because if I'd stayed interested

05:38.440 --> 05:45.240
in space in the, you know, mid to late 1960s, I would have had a long wait before, you know,

05:45.240 --> 05:48.320
space really blossomed as an area.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.720
Adding as everything.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.720
Right.

05:50.720 --> 05:57.080
I got interested in physics and then, well, the actual sort of detailed story is when

05:57.080 --> 06:01.480
I kind of graduated from elementary school at age 12.

06:01.480 --> 06:08.280
That's the time when in England where you finish elementary school, I sort of, my gift

06:08.280 --> 06:16.080
sort of, I suppose, more or less for myself was I got this collection of physics books,

06:16.080 --> 06:22.280
which was some college physics course of college physics books and volume five about statistical

06:22.280 --> 06:29.840
physics and has this picture on the cover that shows a bunch of kind of idealized molecules

06:29.840 --> 06:35.200
sitting in one side of a box and then it has a series of frames showing how these molecules

06:35.200 --> 06:37.040
sort of spread out in the box.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.280
And I thought, that's pretty interesting, you know, what causes that?

06:41.280 --> 06:46.600
And you know, read the book and the book, the book actually, one of the things that was

06:46.600 --> 06:50.520
really significant to me about that was the book kind of claimed, although I didn't really

06:50.520 --> 06:55.440
understand what it said in detail, it kind of claimed that this sort of principle of

06:55.440 --> 06:58.520
physics was derivable somehow.

06:58.520 --> 07:03.960
And you know, other things I'd learned about physics, it was all like, it's a fact that

07:03.960 --> 07:05.080
energy is conserved.

07:05.120 --> 07:11.000
It's a fact that relativity works or something, not, it's something you can derive from some

07:11.000 --> 07:15.720
fundamental sort of, it has to be that way as a matter of kind of mathematics or logic

07:15.720 --> 07:16.720
or something.

07:16.720 --> 07:20.800
So it was sort of interesting to me that there was a thing about physics that was kind of

07:20.800 --> 07:24.040
inevitably true and derivable, so to speak.

07:24.040 --> 07:29.680
And so I think that, so then I was like, there's a picture on this book and I was trying to

07:29.680 --> 07:30.880
understand it.

07:30.880 --> 07:35.680
And so that was actually the first serious program that I wrote for a computer was probably

07:35.680 --> 07:42.280
1973, written for this computer, the size of a desk program with paper tape and so on.

07:42.280 --> 07:47.240
And I tried to reproduce this picture on the book and it didn't succeed.

07:47.240 --> 07:48.560
What was the failure mode there?

07:48.560 --> 07:49.800
Like what do you mean it didn't succeed?

07:49.800 --> 07:50.800
So it's a bunch of little-

07:50.800 --> 07:55.280
It didn't look like, it didn't look like, okay, so what happened is, okay, many years

07:55.280 --> 07:58.760
later I learned how the picture on the book was actually made and that it was actually

07:58.760 --> 08:02.920
kind of a fake, but I didn't know that at that time.

08:02.920 --> 08:07.440
But and that picture was actually a very high-tech thing when it was made in the beginning of

08:07.440 --> 08:12.400
the 1960s, was made on the largest supercomputer that existed at the time.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.760
And even so, it couldn't quite simulate the thing that it was supposed to be simulating.

08:16.760 --> 08:20.320
But anyway, I didn't know that until many, many, many years later.

08:20.320 --> 08:25.000
So at the time, it was like, you have these balls bouncing around in this box, but I was

08:25.040 --> 08:29.680
using this computer with eight kilo words of memory, whatever, 18-bit words, memory words,

08:29.680 --> 08:30.680
okay?

08:30.680 --> 08:35.000
So it was whatever, 24 kilobytes of memory.

08:35.000 --> 08:41.160
And it had these instructions, I probably still remember all of its machine instructions.

08:41.160 --> 08:45.320
And it didn't really like dealing with floating point numbers or anything like that.

08:45.320 --> 08:50.200
And so I had to simplify this model of particles bouncing around in the box.

08:50.200 --> 08:54.960
And so I thought, well, I'll put them on a grid and I'll make the things just so that

08:55.000 --> 08:57.880
they just sort of move one square at a time and so on.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.600
And so I did the simulation.

09:00.600 --> 09:05.480
And the result was it didn't look anything like the actual pictures on the book.

09:05.480 --> 09:12.800
Now, many years later, in fact, very recently, I realized that the thing I'd simulated was

09:12.800 --> 09:18.520
actually an example of a whole sort of computational irreducibility story that I absolutely did

09:18.520 --> 09:19.760
not recognize at the time.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.880
At the time, it just looked like it did something random and it looks wrong.

09:23.920 --> 09:27.560
As opposed to it did something random and it's super interesting that it's random.

09:27.560 --> 09:30.520
But I didn't recognize that at the time.

09:30.520 --> 09:36.440
And so as it was at the time, I got interested in particle physics and I got interested in

09:36.440 --> 09:38.480
other kinds of physics.

09:38.480 --> 09:42.560
But this whole second law of thermodynamics thing, this idea that sort of orderly things

09:42.560 --> 09:47.160
tend to degrade into disorder, continued to be something I was really interested in.

09:47.160 --> 09:52.080
And I was really curious for the whole universe, why doesn't that happen all the time?

09:52.160 --> 09:56.800
We start off in the big bang at the beginning of the universe was this thing that seems

09:56.800 --> 10:00.440
like it's this very disordered collection of stuff.

10:00.440 --> 10:06.400
And then it spontaneously forms itself into galaxies and creates all of this complexity

10:06.400 --> 10:08.200
and order in the universe.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.960
And so I was very curious how that happens.

10:10.960 --> 10:15.720
But I was always kind of thinking, this is kind of somehow the second law of thermodynamics

10:15.720 --> 10:20.920
is behind it trying to sort of pull things back into disorder, so to speak.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.720
And how was order being created?

10:23.720 --> 10:29.200
And so actually, I was interested, this is probably now 1980, I got interested in kind

10:29.200 --> 10:32.400
of this galaxy formation and so on in the universe.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.360
I also at that time was interested in neural networks.

10:35.360 --> 10:40.680
And I was interested in kind of how brains make complicated things happen and so on.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.680
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

10:41.680 --> 10:45.880
What's the connection between the formation of galaxies and how brains make complicated

10:45.880 --> 10:46.880
things happen?

10:46.880 --> 10:50.400
Because they're both a matter of how complicated things come to happen.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.960
Some simple origins.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.400
Yeah, from some sort of known origins.

10:55.400 --> 11:01.240
I had the sense that what I was interested in was kind of in all these different, this

11:01.240 --> 11:07.440
sort of different cases of where complicated things were arising from rules.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.960
And I also looked at snowflakes and things like that.

11:10.960 --> 11:13.840
I was curious and fluid dynamics in general.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.920
I was just sort of curious about how does complexity arise.

11:16.920 --> 11:23.080
And the thing that I didn't, it took me a while to kind of realize that there might

11:23.080 --> 11:24.480
be a general phenomenon.

11:24.480 --> 11:29.040
I sort of assumed, oh, there's galaxies over here, there's brains over here, they're very

11:29.040 --> 11:30.680
different kinds of things.

11:30.680 --> 11:35.520
And so what happened, this is probably 1981 or so, I decided, okay, I'm going to try

11:35.520 --> 11:39.360
and make the minimal model of how these things work.

11:39.360 --> 11:45.080
And it was sort of an interesting experience because I had built, starting in 1979, I built

11:45.080 --> 11:49.840
my first big computer system, I think called SMP, Symbolic Manipulation Program, it's kind

11:49.840 --> 11:54.000
of a forerunner of modern or from language, with many of the same ideas about symbolic

11:54.000 --> 11:56.320
computation and so on.

11:56.320 --> 12:01.560
But the thing that was very important to me about that was, in building that language,

12:01.560 --> 12:07.040
I had basically tried to figure out what were the relevant computational primitives, which

12:07.040 --> 12:11.560
have turned out to stay with me for the last 40-something years.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.840
But it was also important because in building a language, it was very different activity

12:15.840 --> 12:19.880
from natural science, which is what I'd mostly done before, because in natural science, you

12:19.880 --> 12:23.720
start from the phenomena of the world, and you try and figure out, so how can I make

12:23.720 --> 12:26.280
sense of the phenomena of the world?

12:26.280 --> 12:30.960
And kind of the world presents you with what it has to offer, so to speak, and you have

12:30.960 --> 12:32.400
to make sense of it.

12:32.400 --> 12:39.600
When you build a computer language or something, you are creating your own primitives, and

12:39.640 --> 12:42.000
then you say, so what can you make from these?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.080
Sort of the opposite way around from what you do in natural science.

12:45.080 --> 12:49.000
But I'd had the experience of doing that, and so I was kind of like, okay, what happens

12:49.000 --> 12:51.080
if you sort of make an artificial physics?

12:51.080 --> 12:55.200
What happens if you just make up the rules by which systems operate?

12:55.200 --> 12:59.360
And then I was thinking, for all these different systems, whether it was galaxies or brains

12:59.360 --> 13:04.680
or whatever, what's the absolutely minimal model that kind of captures the things that

13:04.680 --> 13:06.200
are important about those systems?

13:06.200 --> 13:08.320
The computational primitives of that system.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.320
Yes.

13:09.400 --> 13:13.960
So that's what ended up with the cellular automata, where you just have a line of black

13:13.960 --> 13:19.040
and white cells, and you just have a rule that says, given a cell and its neighbors,

13:19.040 --> 13:21.960
what will the color of the cell be on the next step, and you just run it in a series

13:21.960 --> 13:23.360
of steps.

13:23.360 --> 13:28.120
And the sort of the ironic thing is that cellular automata are great models for many kinds of

13:28.120 --> 13:34.440
things, but galaxies and brains are two examples where they do very, very badly.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.880
They're really irrelevant to those two cases.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.320
Is there a connection to the second law of thermodynamics and cellular automata?

13:39.320 --> 13:40.320
Oh, yes.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.760
The things you've discovered about cellular automata.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
Yes.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.760
Okay.

13:45.760 --> 13:49.640
So when I first started cellular automata, my first papers about them were, you know,

13:49.640 --> 13:54.160
the first sentence was always about the second law of thermodynamics, was always about how

13:54.160 --> 13:58.560
does order manage to be produced even though there's a second law of thermodynamics which

13:58.560 --> 14:01.080
tries to pull things back into disorder.

14:01.080 --> 14:06.680
And I kind of, my early understanding of that had to do with these are intrinsically irreversible

14:06.680 --> 14:12.600
processes in cellular automata that form, you know, can form orderly structures even

14:12.600 --> 14:14.880
from random initial conditions.

14:14.880 --> 14:20.160
But then what I realized, this was, well, actually, it's one of these things where it

14:20.160 --> 14:23.800
was a discovery that I should have made earlier but didn't.

14:23.800 --> 14:28.000
So you know, I had been studying cellular automata, what I did was the sort of most

14:28.000 --> 14:29.520
obvious computer experiment.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.320
You just try all the different rules and see what they do.

14:32.320 --> 14:35.800
It's kind of like, you know, you've invented a computational telescope, you just pointed

14:35.800 --> 14:39.720
at the most obvious thing in the sky and then you just see what's there.

14:39.720 --> 14:43.760
And so I did that and I, you know, was making all these pictures of how cellular automata

14:43.760 --> 14:48.760
work and starting these pictures, I studied in great detail, there was, you can number

14:48.760 --> 14:53.120
the rules for cellular automata and one of them is, you know, rule 30.

14:53.120 --> 14:57.240
So I made a picture of rule 30 back in 1981 or so.

14:57.480 --> 15:02.200
Rule 30, well, it's, and I, at the time, I was just like, oh, okay, it's another one

15:02.200 --> 15:06.680
of these rules, I don't really, it happens to be asymmetric, left, right, asymmetric.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.240
And it's like, let me just consider the case of the symmetric ones, just to keep things

15:10.240 --> 15:12.120
simpler, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.280
And I just kind of ignored it.

15:13.920 --> 15:22.000
And then sort of in, actually, in 1984, strangely enough, I ended up having an early

15:22.000 --> 15:25.400
laser printer, which made very high resolution pictures.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.120
And I thought, I'm going to print out an interesting, you know, I want to make an

15:28.120 --> 15:28.840
interesting picture.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.960
Let me take this rule 30 thing and just make a high resolution picture of it.

15:33.240 --> 15:33.800
I did.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.560
And it's, it has this very remarkable property that its rule is very simple.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.200
You started off just from one black cell at the top, and it makes this kind of triangular

15:42.200 --> 15:42.760
pattern.

15:43.200 --> 15:46.440
But if you look inside this pattern, it looks really random.

15:46.880 --> 15:51.080
There's, you know, you look at the center column of cells and, you know, I studied

15:51.080 --> 15:52.080
that in great detail.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.720
And it's, so far as one can tell, it's completely random.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.080
And it's kind of a little bit like digits of Pi.

15:58.440 --> 16:01.640
Once you, you know, you know, the rule for generating the digits of Pi, but once

16:01.640 --> 16:06.440
you've generated them, you know, 3.14159, et cetera, they seem completely random.

16:07.040 --> 16:11.880
And in fact, I put up this prize back in, what was it, 2019 or something for prove

16:11.960 --> 16:14.240
anything about the sequence, basically.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.000
Has anyone been able to do anything on that?

16:16.520 --> 16:20.760
People have sent me some things, but it's, you know, I don't know how hard these

16:20.760 --> 16:21.400
problems are.

16:21.400 --> 16:27.400
I mean, I, it's kind of spoiled because I, 2007, I put up a prize for determining

16:27.400 --> 16:32.040
whether a particular Turing machine that I thought was the simplest candidate for

16:32.040 --> 16:36.040
being a universal Turing machine, determine whether it is or isn't a universal Turing

16:36.040 --> 16:36.480
machine.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.720
And somebody did a really good job of, of winning that prize, improving that it was

16:40.720 --> 16:43.040
a universal Turing machine in about six months.

16:43.440 --> 16:46.320
And so I, you know, I didn't know whether that would be one of these problems that was

16:46.320 --> 16:50.400
out there for hundreds of years, or whether in this particular case, young chap called

16:50.440 --> 16:53.640
Alex Smith, you know, nailed it in six months.

16:53.960 --> 16:58.480
And so with this rule 30 collection, I don't really know whether these are things

16:58.480 --> 17:02.160
that are a hundred years away from being able to, to get, or whether somebody's going

17:02.160 --> 17:03.720
to come and do something very clever.

17:03.840 --> 17:08.720
It's such a, I mean, it's like for Mars last year, but since rule 30, such a simple

17:08.720 --> 17:15.080
formulation, it feels like anyone can look at it, understand it and feel like it's

17:15.080 --> 17:20.440
within grasp to be able to predict something, to do, to, to derive some kind of law

17:21.320 --> 17:26.000
that allows you to predict something about this middle column of rule 30.

17:26.160 --> 17:26.480
Right.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.120
But you know, this is, yet you can't.

17:29.360 --> 17:29.920
Yeah, right.

17:30.080 --> 17:34.640
This is the intuitional surprise of computational irreducibility and so on that

17:34.640 --> 17:38.320
even though the rules are simple, you can't tell what's going to happen and you

17:38.320 --> 17:39.640
can't prove things about it.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.120
And I think so, so anyway, the thing, I started in 1984 or so, I started

17:46.120 --> 17:49.680
realizing there's this phenomenon that you can have very simple rules.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.520
They produce apparently random behavior.

17:51.880 --> 17:52.200
Okay.

17:52.240 --> 17:56.640
So that's a little bit like the second orthononomics because it's like you have

17:56.640 --> 18:01.680
this simple initial condition, you can, you know, readily see that it's very, you

18:01.680 --> 18:03.560
know, you can describe it very easily.

18:03.960 --> 18:07.520
And yet it makes this thing that seems to be random.

18:08.160 --> 18:13.560
Now, it turns out there's some technical detail about the second orthononomics and

18:13.560 --> 18:19.200
about the idea of reversibility when you have a, if you have kind of a, a, a movie

18:19.480 --> 18:24.560
of two, you know, billion balls colliding and you see them collide and they bounce

18:24.560 --> 18:29.080
off and you run that movie in reverse, you can't tell which way was the forward

18:29.080 --> 18:31.520
direction of time and which way was the backward direction of time.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.640
When you're just looking at individual billion balls, by the time you've got a

18:34.640 --> 18:40.120
whole collection of them, you know, a million of them or something, then it turns

18:40.120 --> 18:40.880
out to be the case.

18:40.880 --> 18:46.080
And this is the, the sort of the mystery of the second law that the orderly thing,

18:46.080 --> 18:50.120
you start with the orderly thing and it becomes disordered and that's the forward

18:50.120 --> 18:51.160
direction in time.

18:51.440 --> 18:55.320
And the other way round of it starts disordered and becomes ordered, you just

18:55.320 --> 18:56.840
don't see that in the world.

18:57.480 --> 19:03.400
Now, in principle, if you, you know, if you sort of traced the detailed motions of

19:03.400 --> 19:09.160
all those molecules backwards, you would be able to, it will, it will, the reverse

19:09.160 --> 19:14.040
of time makes, you know, as you, as you go forwards in time, order goes to disorder.

19:14.080 --> 19:16.400
As you go backwards in time, order goes to disorder.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.520
Perfectly so, yes.

19:17.560 --> 19:17.880
Right.

19:18.160 --> 19:24.360
So the, the mystery is why is it the case that, or one version of the mystery is,

19:24.360 --> 19:29.280
why is it the case that you never see something which happens to be just the kind

19:29.280 --> 19:33.120
of disorder that you would need to somehow evolve to order?

19:33.320 --> 19:34.600
Why does that not happen?

19:34.920 --> 19:38.800
Why do you always just see order goes to disorder, not the other way round?

19:39.320 --> 19:44.240
So the thing that I, I kind of realized, I started realizing in the 1980s is kind

19:44.240 --> 19:46.480
of like, it's a bit like cryptography.

19:46.720 --> 19:51.480
It's kind of like you start off from this, this key that's pretty simple and then you've

19:51.480 --> 19:55.880
kind of run it and you can get this, you know, complicated random mess.

19:56.560 --> 20:05.600
And the thing that, that, well, I sort of started realizing back then was that the

20:05.600 --> 20:09.920
second law is kind of a, a, a story of computational reducibility.

20:09.960 --> 20:15.240
It's a story of, you know, what seems, you know, what, what we can describe easily at

20:15.240 --> 20:21.200
the beginning, we can only describe with a lot of computational effort at the end.

20:21.840 --> 20:30.160
Okay, so now we come many, many years later and I was trying to sort of, well, having

20:30.160 --> 20:37.760
done this big project to understand fundamental physics, I realized that sort of a key aspect

20:37.760 --> 20:40.400
of that is understanding what observers are like.

20:41.040 --> 20:47.160
And then I realized that the second law of thermodynamics is the same story as a bunch

20:47.200 --> 20:48.240
of these other cases.

20:49.040 --> 20:55.960
It is a story of a computationally bounded observer trying to observe a computationally

20:55.960 --> 20:57.040
irreducible system.

20:57.520 --> 21:01.960
So it's a story of, you know, underneath the molecules are bouncing around.

21:02.280 --> 21:07.360
They're bouncing around in this completely determined way, determined by rules.

21:08.000 --> 21:16.680
But the point is that, that we as computationally bounded observers can't tell that there were

21:16.680 --> 21:18.480
these sort of simple underlying rules.

21:18.720 --> 21:20.120
To us, it just looks random.

21:20.160 --> 21:26.240
And when it comes to this question about, can you prepare the initial state so that, um, you

21:26.240 --> 21:31.320
know, the disordered thing is, you know, how exactly the right disorder to make something

21:31.320 --> 21:34.720
orderly, a computationally bounded observer cannot do that.

21:35.120 --> 21:39.720
We'd have to have done all of this sort of irreducible computation to work out very

21:39.720 --> 21:45.480
precisely what this disordered state, what the exact right disordered state is so that

21:45.480 --> 21:48.280
we would get this ordered thing produced from it.

21:48.320 --> 21:51.560
What does it mean to be computationally bounded observer?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.840
So observing a computationally irreducible system.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.600
So the computationally bounded, is there something formal you can say there?

21:58.680 --> 21:59.000
Right.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.320
So it means, okay, you can, you can talk about Turing machines.

22:03.320 --> 22:09.280
You can talk about computational complexity theory and, uh, you know, uh, polynomial

22:09.280 --> 22:10.960
time computation and things like this.

22:11.160 --> 22:15.200
There are a variety of ways to make something more precise, but I think it's more useful.

22:15.200 --> 22:20.520
The intuitive version of it is more useful, which is basically just to say that, you

22:20.520 --> 22:25.080
know, how much computation are you going to do to try and work out what's going on?

22:25.440 --> 22:30.040
And the answer is you're not allowed to do a lot of, we're not able to do a lot of

22:30.040 --> 22:35.680
computation when we, you know, we've got, you know, in this room, there will be a

22:35.680 --> 22:38.520
trillion, trillion, trillion molecules, a little bit less.

22:38.960 --> 22:39.600
It's a big room.

22:40.360 --> 22:40.760
Right.

22:41.120 --> 22:46.680
And, uh, you know, at every moment, you know, there, every microsecond or something,

22:46.680 --> 22:51.960
these molecules, molecules are colliding and that's a lot of computation that's

22:51.960 --> 22:52.600
getting done.

22:53.040 --> 22:59.120
And the question is in our brains, we do a lot less computation every second than the

22:59.120 --> 23:00.960
computation done by all those molecules.

23:01.520 --> 23:07.400
If there is computational irreducibility, we can't work out in detail what all those

23:07.400 --> 23:08.520
molecules are going to do.

23:08.880 --> 23:12.080
What we can do is only a much smaller amount of computation.

23:12.600 --> 23:17.640
And so the, the second law of thermodynamics is this kind of interplay between the

23:17.640 --> 23:23.000
underlying computational irreducibility and the fact that we as preparers of initial

23:23.000 --> 23:28.640
states or as measures of what happens are, you know, are not capable of doing that much

23:28.640 --> 23:29.200
computation.

23:29.200 --> 23:34.840
So to us, another big formulation of the second law of thermodynamics is this idea of

23:34.840 --> 23:36.240
the law of entropy increase.

23:36.640 --> 23:40.880
The characteristic that this universe, the entropy seems to be always increasing.

23:41.360 --> 23:43.280
What does that show to you about the evolution of?

23:44.240 --> 23:44.800
Well, okay.

23:44.800 --> 23:47.840
So, so first of all, we have to say that entropy is, okay.

23:48.280 --> 23:53.760
And that's very confused in the history of thermodynamics because entropy was first

23:53.760 --> 23:59.280
introduced by a guy called Rudolf Clausius and he did it in terms of heat and temperature.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.080
Okay.

24:00.400 --> 24:04.000
Subsequently, it was reformulated by a guy called Ludwig Boltzmann.

24:05.200 --> 24:10.480
And he formulated it in a much more kind of combinatorial type way.

24:11.120 --> 24:15.200
But he always claimed that it was equivalent to Clausius's thing.

24:15.200 --> 24:20.160
And in one particular simple example it is, but that connection between these two

24:20.160 --> 24:22.880
formulations of entropy, they've never been connected.

24:23.440 --> 24:28.000
I mean, there's really, so, okay, so the more general definition of entropy due to

24:28.000 --> 24:30.480
Boltzmann is the following thing.

24:30.480 --> 24:34.080
So you say, I have a system and it has many possible configurations.

24:34.080 --> 24:37.200
The molecules can be in many different arrangements, etc., etc., etc.

24:37.920 --> 24:42.880
If we know something about the system, for example, we know it's in a box,

24:42.880 --> 24:47.280
it has a certain pressure, it has a certain temperature, we know these overall facts about it.

24:47.280 --> 24:51.200
Then we say, how many microscopic configurations of the system

24:51.840 --> 24:54.000
are possible given those overall constraints?

24:54.320 --> 24:58.240
And the entropy is the logarithm of that number.

24:58.800 --> 24:59.760
That's the definition.

25:00.320 --> 25:04.800
And that's the kind of the general definition of entropy that turns out to be useful.

25:04.800 --> 25:09.200
Now, in Boltzmann's time, he thought these molecules could be placed anywhere you want.

25:10.880 --> 25:16.640
But he said, oh, actually, we can make it a lot simpler by having the molecules be discrete.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.880
Well, actually, he didn't know molecules existed.

25:19.360 --> 25:26.640
And in his time, 1860s and so on, the idea that matter might be made of discrete stuff

25:27.200 --> 25:29.760
had been floated ever since ancient Greek times.

25:29.760 --> 25:34.400
But it had been a long time debate about, is matter discrete, is it continuous?

25:34.960 --> 25:40.640
At the moment at that time, people mostly thought that matter was continuous.

25:41.360 --> 25:45.920
And it was all confused with this question about what heat is, and people thought heat was this

25:45.920 --> 25:54.880
fluid. And it was a big, big muddle. And this Boltzmann said, let's assume there are discrete

25:54.880 --> 26:00.080
molecules. Let's even assume they have discrete energy levels. Let's say everything is discrete.

26:00.080 --> 26:05.040
Then we can do sort of combinatorial mathematics and work out how many configurations of these

26:05.040 --> 26:09.600
things there will be in the box. And we can say we can compute this entropy quantity.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.840
But he said, but of course, it's just a fiction that these things are discrete.

26:13.920 --> 26:19.840
So he said, this is an interesting piece of history, by the way, that at that time,

26:19.840 --> 26:23.840
people didn't know molecules existed. There were other hints from looking at

26:24.480 --> 26:28.560
kind of chemistry that there might be discrete atoms and so on, just from the

26:28.560 --> 26:35.040
combinatorics of two hydrogens and one oxygen make water, two amounts of hydrogen plus one

26:35.040 --> 26:40.160
amount of oxygen together make water, things like this. But it wasn't known that discrete

26:40.160 --> 26:50.400
molecules existed. And in fact, the people, it wasn't until the beginning of the 20th century

26:50.400 --> 26:55.360
that Brownian motion was the final giveaway. Brownian motion is, you look under a microscope at

26:55.360 --> 27:00.480
these little pieces from pollen grains, you see they're being discreetly kicked. And those kicks

27:00.480 --> 27:07.040
are water molecules hitting them and they're discrete. And in fact, it was really quite

27:07.120 --> 27:12.240
interesting history. I mean, Boltzmann had worked out how things could be discrete and

27:12.240 --> 27:18.480
have basically invented something like quantum theory in the 1860s. But he just thought it

27:18.480 --> 27:23.440
wasn't really the way it worked. And then just a piece of physics history, because I think it's

27:23.440 --> 27:29.120
kind of interesting. In 1900, this guy called Max Planck, who'd been a longtime thermodynamics

27:29.120 --> 27:32.800
person who was trying to, everybody was trying to prove the second law of thermodynamics,

27:32.800 --> 27:38.400
including Max Planck. And Max Planck believed that radiation, like electromagnetic radiation,

27:38.400 --> 27:42.720
somehow the interaction of that with matter was going to prove the second law of thermodynamics.

27:43.360 --> 27:47.680
But he had these experiments that people had done on black body radiation,

27:47.680 --> 27:53.360
and they were these curves. And you couldn't fit the curves based on his idea for how

27:53.360 --> 27:58.000
radiation interacted with matter, those curves, you couldn't figure out how to fit those curves.

27:58.640 --> 28:04.400
Except he noticed that if he just did what Boltzmann had done and assumed that

28:04.400 --> 28:11.360
electromagnetic radiation was discrete, he could fit the curves. But this just happens to work this

28:11.360 --> 28:17.440
way. Then Einstein came along and said, well, by the way, the electromagnetic field might

28:17.440 --> 28:23.200
actually be discrete. It might be made of photons. And then that explains how this all works. And

28:23.280 --> 28:31.600
that was in 1905, that was how that piece of quantum mechanics got started.

28:31.600 --> 28:35.600
Kind of interesting, interesting piece of history. I didn't know until I was researching this recently.

28:36.160 --> 28:43.280
In 1904 and 1903, Einstein wrote three different papers. And so just sort of

28:44.240 --> 28:49.360
well-known physics history. In 1905, Einstein wrote these three papers, one introduced relativity

28:49.360 --> 28:58.560
theory, one explained Brownian motion and one introduced basically photons. So kind of a big

28:58.560 --> 29:04.640
deal year for physics and for Einstein. But in the years before that, he'd written several papers,

29:04.640 --> 29:08.160
and what were they about? They were about the second law of thermodynamics. And they were

29:08.160 --> 29:14.560
an attempt to prove the second law of thermodynamics and their nonsense. And so I had no idea that

29:14.560 --> 29:21.440
he'd done this. Interesting. Neither. And in fact, what he did, those three papers in 1905, well,

29:21.440 --> 29:25.680
not so much the relativity paper, the one on Brownian motion, the one on photons,

29:25.680 --> 29:32.320
both of these were about the story of sort of making the world discrete. And then he got

29:32.320 --> 29:37.600
those like that idea from Boltzmann. But Boltzmann didn't think, you know, Boltzmann kind of died

29:37.600 --> 29:42.720
believing, you know, he said, he has a quote actually, you know, in the end, things are going

29:42.720 --> 29:46.320
to turn out to be discrete. And I'm going to write down what I have to say about this because,

29:47.600 --> 29:51.120
you know, eventually, this stuff will be rediscovered and I want to leave, you know,

29:51.120 --> 29:56.400
what I can about how things are going to be discrete. But, you know, I think he has some

29:56.400 --> 30:03.840
quote about how, you know, one person can't stand against the tide of history in saying that,

30:03.840 --> 30:09.440
you know, matter is discrete. Oh, so he's stuck by his guns in terms of matter is discrete.

30:09.440 --> 30:15.920
Yes, he did. And the, you know, what's interesting about this is, at the time,

30:15.920 --> 30:19.280
everybody, including Einstein kind of assumed that space was probably going to end up being

30:19.280 --> 30:23.280
discrete too. But that didn't work out technically because it wasn't consistent with

30:23.280 --> 30:28.640
relativity theory, it didn't seem to be. And so then in the history of physics, even though

30:28.640 --> 30:35.600
people had determined that matter was discrete, electromagnetic field was discrete, space was

30:35.680 --> 30:41.440
a holdout of not being discrete. And in fact, Einstein, 1916, has this nice letter he wrote,

30:41.440 --> 30:45.600
where he says, in the end, it will turn out space is discrete, but we don't have the mathematical

30:45.600 --> 30:51.760
tools necessary to figure out how that works yet. And so, you know, I think it's kind of cool that

30:51.760 --> 30:57.760
a hundred years later we do. Yes, for you, you're pretty sure that at every layer of reality,

30:57.760 --> 31:03.920
it's discrete. Right. And that space is discrete. And that the, I mean, and in fact, one of the

31:03.920 --> 31:11.600
things I realized recently is this kind of theory of heat, that the, you know, that heat is really

31:11.600 --> 31:18.640
this continuous fluid, it's kind of like the, you know, the caloric theory of heat, which turns

31:18.640 --> 31:22.880
out to be completely wrong, because actually, heat is the motion of discrete molecules,

31:22.880 --> 31:26.640
unless you know there are discrete molecules, it's hard to understand what heat could possibly be.

31:27.360 --> 31:33.520
Well, you know, I think space is discrete. And the question is kind of what's the analog

31:33.520 --> 31:41.680
of the mistake that was made with caloric in the case of space. And so, my current guess

31:41.680 --> 31:49.040
is that dark matter is, as I've, my little sort of aphorism of the last few months has been,

31:49.040 --> 31:55.040
you know, dark matter is the caloric of our time. That is, it will turn out that dark matter is a

31:55.040 --> 32:00.800
feature of space. And it is not a bunch of particles. You know, at the time when, when people

32:00.800 --> 32:04.800
were talking about heat, they knew about fluids. And they said, well, heat must be just be another

32:04.800 --> 32:09.120
kind of fluid, because that's what they knew about. But now people know about particles. And so,

32:09.120 --> 32:13.600
they say, well, what's dark matter? It's not, it's not, it just must be particles.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.480
So what could dark matter be as a feature of space?

32:16.480 --> 32:21.440
Oh, I don't know yet. I mean, I think the, the thing I'm really one of the things I'm hoping

32:21.440 --> 32:27.440
to be able to do is to find the analog of Brownian motion in space. So, in other words, Brownian

32:27.440 --> 32:33.040
motion was, was seeing down to the level of an effect from individual molecules. And so,

32:33.040 --> 32:37.600
in the case of space, you know, most of the things, the things we see about space so far,

32:37.600 --> 32:42.400
just everything seems continuous. Brownian motion had been discovered in the 1830s.

32:42.400 --> 32:48.640
And it was only identified what it was, what it was the, the, the result of by Smoluchowski

32:48.640 --> 32:54.320
and Einstein at the beginning of the 20th century. And, you know, dark matter was, was discovered,

32:54.320 --> 32:59.280
that phenomenon was discovered 100 years ago. You know, the rotation curves of galaxies don't

32:59.280 --> 33:04.880
follow the luminous matter that was discovered 100 years ago. And I think, you know, that I

33:04.880 --> 33:10.320
wouldn't be surprised if there isn't an effect that we already know about that is kind of the

33:10.320 --> 33:15.680
analog of Brownian motion that reveals the discreteness of space. And in fact, we're beginning

33:15.680 --> 33:20.800
to have some guesses, we have some, some evidence that black hole mergers work differently when

33:20.800 --> 33:25.760
there's discrete space. And there may be things that you can see in gravitational wave signatures

33:25.760 --> 33:31.600
and things associated with the discreteness of space. But this is kind of, for me, it's kind of,

33:31.600 --> 33:35.040
it's kind of interesting to see this sort of recapitulation of the history of physics,

33:35.600 --> 33:41.440
where people, you know, vehemently say, you know, matter is continuous, electromagnetic field is

33:41.520 --> 33:46.240
continuous. And turns out it isn't true. And then they say space is continuous. But, but so,

33:46.240 --> 33:50.560
you know, entropy is the number of states of the system consistent with some constraint.

33:50.560 --> 33:57.600
Yes. And the thing is that if you have, if you know in great detail the position of every molecule

33:57.600 --> 34:05.200
in the gas, the entropy is, is always zero, because there's only one possible state. The,

34:05.200 --> 34:09.440
the configuration of molecules in the gas, the molecules bounce around, they have a certain

34:09.440 --> 34:14.800
rule for bouncing around. There's just one state of the gas evolves to one state of the gas and so

34:14.800 --> 34:20.640
on. But it's only if you don't know in detail where all the molecules are, that you can say,

34:20.640 --> 34:25.440
well, the entropy increases, because the things we do know about the molecules, there are more

34:25.440 --> 34:29.600
possible microscopic states of the system consistent with what we do know about where the

34:29.600 --> 34:37.200
molecules are. And so the question of whether, so people, this sort of paradox in a sense of,

34:37.200 --> 34:41.360
oh, if we knew where all the molecules where the entropy wouldn't increase, there was this idea

34:41.360 --> 34:48.320
introduced by, by Gibbs in the early 20th century, well, actually the very beginning of the 20th

34:48.320 --> 34:53.760
century, as a physics professor, an American physics professor was sort of the first distinguished

34:53.760 --> 35:02.160
American physics professor at Yale. And he introduced this idea of coarse-graining, this idea that,

35:02.160 --> 35:06.320
well, you know, these molecules have a detailed way they're bouncing around, but we can only

35:06.320 --> 35:12.000
observe a coarse-grained version of that. But the confusion has been nobody knew what a valid

35:12.000 --> 35:17.040
coarse-graining would be. So nobody knew that whether you could have this coarse-graining that

35:17.040 --> 35:25.200
very carefully was sculpted in just such a way that it would notice that the particular configurations

35:25.200 --> 35:29.200
that you could get from the simple initial condition, you know, they fit into this coarse-graining,

35:29.200 --> 35:35.520
and the coarse-graining very carefully observes that. Why can't you do that kind of very detailed,

35:35.520 --> 35:41.040
precise coarse-graining? The answer is, because if you are a computationally bounded observer,

35:41.040 --> 35:46.720
and the underlying dynamics is computationally irreducible, that's, that's what defines possible

35:46.720 --> 35:53.120
coarse-graining is what a computationally bounded observer can do. And it's the, it's the fact that

35:53.120 --> 36:00.960
a computationally bounded observer is, is forced to look only at this kind of coarse-grained version

36:00.960 --> 36:07.360
of what the system is doing. That's why, and because the, what's, what's going on underneath

36:07.360 --> 36:14.080
is it's kind of filling out this, this, the different possible, you're ending up with something where

36:15.360 --> 36:25.280
the sort of underlying computational irreducibility is your, if all you can see is what the

36:25.360 --> 36:29.760
coarse-grained result is with compute, with a sort of computationally bounded observation,

36:30.400 --> 36:36.480
then inevitably there are many possible underlying configurations that are consistent with that.

36:36.480 --> 36:41.600
Just to clarify, basically any observer that exists inside the universe

36:42.640 --> 36:47.360
is going to be computationally bounded. No, any observer like us. I don't know, I can't imagine.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.400
When you say like us, what do you mean, what do you mean like us?

36:51.120 --> 36:56.800
Well, humans with finite minds. You're including the tools of science.

36:56.800 --> 37:03.440
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, and, and, and as we, you know, we have more precise, and by the way,

37:03.440 --> 37:07.520
there are little sort of microscopic violations of the second law of thermodynamics

37:07.520 --> 37:11.760
that you can start to have when you have more precise measurements of where precisely molecules

37:11.760 --> 37:18.960
are. But for, for a large scale, when you have enough molecules, we don't have, you know, we're

37:18.960 --> 37:24.000
not tracing all those molecules and we just don't have the computational resources to do that.

37:24.000 --> 37:31.440
And it wouldn't be, you know, I think that the, to imagine what an observer who is not

37:31.440 --> 37:36.720
computationally bounded would be like. It's an interesting thing because, okay, so what does

37:36.720 --> 37:41.920
computational boundedness mean? Among other things, it means we conclude that definite things happen.

37:42.480 --> 37:47.520
We go, we take all this complexity of the world and we make a decision. We're going to turn left

37:47.600 --> 37:57.040
or turn right. And that is kind of reducing all this kind of detail into we're observing it,

37:57.040 --> 38:02.080
we're, we're, we're sort of crushing it down to this, this one thing. Yeah. And, and that,

38:02.080 --> 38:07.760
if we didn't do that, we wouldn't, we wouldn't have all this sort of symbolic structure that we

38:07.760 --> 38:14.400
build up that lets us think things through with our finite minds. We'd be instead, you know,

38:14.400 --> 38:20.560
we'd be just, we'd be sort of one with the universe. Yeah. So content to not simplify.

38:21.200 --> 38:28.640
Yes. If we didn't simplify, then we wouldn't be like us. We would be like the universe, like

38:28.640 --> 38:34.400
the, the intrinsic universe, but not having experiences like the experiences we have,

38:34.400 --> 38:40.240
where we, for example, conclude that definite things happen. We, you know, we, we sort of have

38:40.320 --> 38:47.200
this, this notion of being able to make, make sort of narrative statements. Yeah. I wonder if

38:47.200 --> 38:52.160
it's just like you imagined as a thought experiment, what it's like to be a computer. I wonder if it's

38:52.160 --> 38:58.640
possible to try to begin to imagine what it's like to be an unbounded computational observer.

38:58.640 --> 39:03.840
Well, okay. So here's, here's how that I think plays out. Vibrations.

39:04.400 --> 39:10.560
Yeah. So, I mean, in this, we talk about this Ruliad, this spaceable possible computations.

39:10.560 --> 39:16.400
Yes. And this idea of, you know, being at a certain place in the Ruliad, which corresponds to sort

39:16.400 --> 39:23.040
of a certain way of, of rep, of a certain set of computations that you are representing things in

39:23.040 --> 39:30.400
terms of. Okay. So as you expand out in the Ruliad, as you kind of encompass more possible

39:30.480 --> 39:35.200
views of the universe, as you encompass more possible kinds of computations that you can do,

39:35.760 --> 39:39.680
eventually you might say, that's a real win. You know, we're, we're colonizing the Ruliad.

39:39.680 --> 39:44.080
We're, we're, we're building out more paradigms about how to think about things.

39:44.080 --> 39:49.520
And eventually you might say, we, we, we won all the way. We managed to colonize the whole Ruliad.

39:49.520 --> 39:55.200
Okay. Here's the problem with that. The problem is that the notion of existence, coherent existence

39:56.000 --> 40:00.240
requires some kind of specialization. By the time you are the whole Ruliad,

40:00.240 --> 40:05.120
by the time you cover the whole Ruliad, in no useful sense do you coherently exist.

40:05.840 --> 40:13.600
So in other words, in, in the notion of existence, the notion of what we think of as, as, as definite

40:13.600 --> 40:20.880
existence requires this kind of specialization, requires this kind of idea that we are, we are not

40:21.680 --> 40:27.600
all possible things. We are the, a particular set of things. And that's kind of how we,

40:28.240 --> 40:33.760
that that's kind of what, what makes us have a coherent existence. If we were spread throughout

40:33.760 --> 40:39.280
the Ruliad, we would not, there would be no coherence to the way that we work. We would work

40:39.280 --> 40:45.120
in all possible ways. And that wouldn't be kind of a notion of identity. We wouldn't have this

40:45.120 --> 40:54.000
notion of kind of, of, of, of coherent identity. I am geographically located somewhere exactly

40:54.000 --> 41:00.240
precisely in the Ruliad. Therefore, I am. Yes. Yeah, yeah, right. Well, you're in a certain

41:00.240 --> 41:06.080
place in physical space, you're in a certain place in rural space. And if, if you are, if you are

41:06.080 --> 41:13.680
sufficiently spread out, you are no longer coherent. And you no longer have, I mean, in the,

41:13.680 --> 41:18.640
in our perception of what it means to exist and to have experience, it doesn't happen that way.

41:18.640 --> 41:22.400
So therefore, so to exist means to be computationally bounded.

41:23.120 --> 41:28.000
I think so. To exist in the way that we think of ourselves as existing. Yes.

41:28.000 --> 41:33.040
The very act of existence is like operating in this place that's computationally reducible.

41:33.040 --> 41:36.480
So there's this giant mess of things going on that you can't possibly predict.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.280
But nevertheless, because of your limitations,

41:39.840 --> 41:46.480
you have an imperative of like, what is it, an imperative or a skill set to simplify,

41:46.480 --> 41:50.720
or an ignorance, a sufficient level. Okay. So the thing which is not obvious is that

41:50.720 --> 41:55.600
you are taking a slice of all this complexity, just like we have all of these molecules bouncing

41:55.600 --> 42:00.640
around in the room. But all we notice is, you know, the, the, the kind of the flow of the air

42:00.640 --> 42:06.960
or the pressure of the air, we're just noticing these particular things. And the, the big

42:07.040 --> 42:12.720
interesting thing is that there are rules, there are laws that govern those big things that we,

42:12.720 --> 42:16.640
we observe. So it's not obvious. That's amazing. Because it doesn't feel like it's a slice.

42:17.280 --> 42:21.680
Yeah. Well, right. It's not a slice. It's like a, it's like an abstraction.

42:22.560 --> 42:27.120
Yes. But, but I mean, the fact that the gas laws work, that we can describe pressure,

42:27.120 --> 42:31.760
volume, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and we don't have to go down to the level of talking

42:31.760 --> 42:37.440
about individual molecules, that is a non-trivial fact. And, and here's the thing that I sort of

42:37.440 --> 42:43.840
exciting thing as far as I'm concerned, the fact that there are certain aspects of the universe.

42:43.840 --> 42:48.720
So, you know, we think space is made ultimately these atoms of space and these hypergraphs and so

42:48.720 --> 42:56.800
on. And we think that, but we nevertheless perceive the universe at a large scale to be like continuous

42:56.800 --> 43:03.600
space and so on. We, in quantum mechanics, we think that there are these many threads of time,

43:03.600 --> 43:09.920
these many threads of history, yet we kind of span. So, so, you know, in quantum mechanics,

43:09.920 --> 43:16.320
in our models of physics, there are these, time is not a single thread. Time breaks into many

43:16.320 --> 43:23.120
threads. They branch, they merge. And, but we are part of that branching, merging universe.

43:23.760 --> 43:29.280
And so, our brains are also branching and merging. And so, when we perceive the universe,

43:29.920 --> 43:37.040
we are branching brains perceiving a branching universe. And so, the fact that the claim that we

43:38.880 --> 43:43.520
believe that we are persistent in time, we have this single thread of experience,

43:43.520 --> 43:49.040
that's the statement that somehow we managed to aggregate together those separate threads of time

43:49.040 --> 43:53.120
that are separated in the operation of, in the fundamental operation of the universe.

43:53.120 --> 43:58.400
So, just as in space, we're averaging over some big region of space and we're looking at many,

43:58.400 --> 44:03.680
many of the aggregate effects of many atoms of space. So, similarly, in what we call branchial

44:03.680 --> 44:09.280
space, the space of these, these quantum branches, we are effectively averaging over many different

44:09.280 --> 44:15.840
branches of possible of histories of the universe. And so, and in thermodynamics,

44:15.840 --> 44:21.120
we're averaging over many configurations of, you know, many, many possible positions of molecules.

44:21.760 --> 44:26.880
So, what we see here is that the question is, when you do that averaging for space,

44:26.880 --> 44:31.120
what are the aggregate laws of space? When you do that averaging over branchial space,

44:31.120 --> 44:36.960
what are the aggregate laws of branchial space? When you do that averaging over the molecules

44:36.960 --> 44:43.120
and so on, what are the aggregate laws you get? And this is, this is the thing that I think is just

44:43.600 --> 44:48.560
amazingly, amazingly neat. Is that, that there are aggregate laws at all?

44:48.560 --> 44:53.280
Well, yes, but the question is, what are those aggregate laws? So, the answer is for space,

44:53.280 --> 44:56.960
the aggregate laws, Einstein's equations for gravity for the structure of spacetime,

44:57.600 --> 45:04.160
for branchial space, the aggregate laws are the laws of quantum mechanics. And for the case of,

45:04.160 --> 45:09.200
of molecules and things, the aggregate laws are basically the second law of thermodynamics.

45:09.920 --> 45:14.560
And so, the, that's the, and the things that follow from the second law of thermodynamics.

45:15.120 --> 45:21.280
And so, what that means is that the three great theories of 20th century physics,

45:21.280 --> 45:25.600
which are basically general relativity, the theory of gravity, quantum mechanics,

45:25.600 --> 45:29.520
and statistical mechanics, which is what kind of grows out of the second law of thermodynamics,

45:30.240 --> 45:36.640
all three of the great theories of 20th century physics are the result of this interplay between

45:36.640 --> 45:42.960
computational irreducibility and the computational boundedness of observers. And, you know, for me,

45:43.680 --> 45:49.440
this is really neat because it means that all three of these laws are derivable.

45:49.440 --> 45:54.400
So, we used to think that, for example, Einstein's equations were just sort of a wheel-in feature

45:54.400 --> 45:58.880
of our universe, that they could be in my universe, might be that way, it might not be that way,

45:59.440 --> 46:04.080
quantum mechanics is just like, well, it just happens to be that way. And the second law,

46:04.080 --> 46:08.640
people had kind of thought, well, maybe it is derivable. Okay. What turns out to be the case

46:08.640 --> 46:13.680
is that all three of the fundamental principles of physics are derivable, but they're not derivable

46:13.680 --> 46:19.840
just from mathematics. They require, or just from some kind of logic or computation, they require

46:19.840 --> 46:25.840
one more thing. They require that the observer, that the thing that is sampling the way the

46:25.840 --> 46:31.040
universe works, is an observer who has these characteristics of computational boundedness

46:31.120 --> 46:37.120
of belief and persistence and time. And so, that means that it is the nature of the observer,

46:38.560 --> 46:42.880
you know, the rough nature of the observer, not the details of where we got two eyes and we

46:42.880 --> 46:49.280
observed photons of this frequency and so on. But the kind of the very course features of the

46:49.280 --> 46:57.200
observer then imply these very precise facts about physics. And I think it's amazing.

46:57.200 --> 47:03.600
So, if we just look at the actual experience of the observer that we experience this reality,

47:03.600 --> 47:09.360
it seems real to us. And you're saying because of our bounded nature, it's actually all an illusion.

47:10.400 --> 47:14.080
It's a simplification. Well, yeah, it's a simplification. Right. What's, what's

47:14.080 --> 47:19.040
So, you don't think a simplification is an illusion? No, I mean, it's, it's, well,

47:19.760 --> 47:25.120
I don't know. I mean, what's underneath? Okay, that's an interesting question.

47:25.520 --> 47:31.760
What's real? And that relates to the whole question of why does the universe exist? And,

47:32.320 --> 47:38.160
you know, what is the difference between reality and a mere representation of what's going on?

47:38.160 --> 47:41.040
Yes. We experience the representation.

47:41.760 --> 47:49.840
Yes. But the, the question of, so, so one question is, you know, why is there a thing

47:49.840 --> 47:56.720
which we can experience that way? And the answer is, because this Rulliard object,

47:57.360 --> 48:03.760
which is this entangled limit of all possible computations, there is no choice about it. It

48:03.760 --> 48:09.920
has to exist. It has to, there has to be such a thing. It is in the same sense that, you know,

48:09.920 --> 48:15.280
two plus two, if you define what two is and you plot pluses and so on, two plus two has to equal

48:15.280 --> 48:21.280
four. Similarly, this Rulliard, this limit of all possible computations, just has to be a thing

48:21.280 --> 48:26.880
you, that is, once you have the idea of computation, you inevitably have the Rulliard.

48:26.880 --> 48:28.320
You're going to have to have a Rulliard, yeah.

48:28.320 --> 48:33.200
Right. And what's important about it, there's just one of it. It's, it's, it's just this unique

48:33.200 --> 48:43.920
object. And that unique object necessarily exists. And then the question is, what, and then we are,

48:43.920 --> 48:49.360
once, once you know that we are sort of embedded in that and taking samples of it,

48:49.360 --> 48:55.520
that it's sort of inevitable that there is this thing that we can perceive that is, you know,

48:55.520 --> 49:04.400
that our perception of kind of physical reality necessarily is that way, given that we are observers

49:04.400 --> 49:10.240
with the characteristics we have. So in other words, the fact that, the fact that the universe

49:10.240 --> 49:16.080
exists is, it's actually, it's almost like it's, you know, to think about it almost

49:16.080 --> 49:22.000
theologically, so to speak. And I've really, it's funny because a lot of the questions about

49:22.000 --> 49:27.840
the existence of the universe and so on, they transcend what kind of the science of the last

49:27.840 --> 49:31.360
few hundred years has really been concerned with. The science of the last few hundred years

49:31.360 --> 49:37.440
hasn't thought it could talk about questions like that. And, but I think it's kind of, and so a lot

49:37.520 --> 49:43.120
of the kind of arguments of, you know, does God exist? You know, is it obvious that I think it,

49:43.120 --> 49:49.920
in some sense, in some representation, it's sort of more obvious that something sort of

49:49.920 --> 49:57.120
bigger than us exists than that we exist. And we are, you know, our existence and as observers,

49:57.120 --> 50:02.480
the way we are is sort of a contingent thing about the universe. And it's more inevitable that the

50:03.200 --> 50:09.200
whole universe, kind of the whole set of all possibilities exists. But this question about,

50:09.200 --> 50:15.840
you know, is it real or is it an illusion? You know, all we know is our experience.

50:16.720 --> 50:25.600
And so the fact that, well, our experience is this absolutely microscopic piece of sample

50:25.680 --> 50:33.360
of the Ruliad. And we're, and, you know, there's this point about, you know, we might sample more

50:33.360 --> 50:37.440
and more of the Ruliad, we might learn more and more about, we might learn, you know, like, like

50:38.080 --> 50:44.720
different areas of physics, like quantum mechanics, for example, the fact that it was discovered,

50:44.720 --> 50:49.440
I think, is closely related to the fact that electronic amplifiers were invented that allowed

50:49.440 --> 50:54.160
you to take a small effect and amplify it up, which hadn't been possible before. You know,

50:54.160 --> 50:59.440
microscopes have been invented that magnify things and so on. But, you know, having a very small

50:59.440 --> 51:04.160
effect and being able to magnify it was sort of a new thing that allowed one to see a different

51:04.160 --> 51:08.800
sort of aspect of the universe and let one discover this kind of thing. So, you know,

51:08.800 --> 51:14.560
we can expect that in the Ruliad, there are an infinite collection of new things we can discover.

51:14.560 --> 51:19.520
There's, in fact, computational irreducibility kind of guarantees that there will be an infinite

51:19.600 --> 51:23.920
collection of kind of, you know, pockets of reducibility that can be discovered.

51:25.760 --> 51:31.200
Boy, would it be fun to take a walk down the Ruliad and see what kind of stuff we find there.
