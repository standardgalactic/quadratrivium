00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.

00:04.880 --> 00:05.880
Oh, yeah.

00:05.880 --> 00:11.240
I got into plenty of trouble about that too.

00:11.240 --> 00:18.880
You're just a man in a suit talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.

00:18.880 --> 00:22.920
There's also people dying, fighting.

00:22.920 --> 00:25.800
It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.

00:25.800 --> 00:28.520
This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.800
There's people trying to ask.

00:30.800 --> 00:35.840
They have many dragons and they're asking themselves the question, who are we?

00:35.840 --> 00:37.240
What is this?

00:37.240 --> 00:39.480
What is the future of this nation?

00:39.480 --> 00:49.280
We thought we are a great nation and I think both countries say this and they say, well,

00:49.280 --> 00:53.200
how do we become the great nation we thought we are?

00:53.960 --> 00:57.760
So first of all, you got in trouble.

00:57.760 --> 01:03.680
What's the dynamics of the trouble and is it something you regret saying?

01:03.680 --> 01:04.680
No, no.

01:04.680 --> 01:05.680
I thought about it a lot.

01:05.680 --> 01:12.200
I laid out four reasons for the war and then I was criticized in the Atlantic for the argument

01:12.200 --> 01:17.280
was reduced to one reason, which was a caricature of the reason.

01:17.280 --> 01:23.000
I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened, mismanagement on the part of the West in

01:23.000 --> 01:28.680
relationship to Russia and foreign policy over the last since the wall fell.

01:28.680 --> 01:32.520
It's understandable because it's extremely complex.

01:32.520 --> 01:38.400
Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source of energy provision for Europe in the wake

01:38.400 --> 01:43.920
of idiot environmental globalist utopianism.

01:43.920 --> 01:51.480
The expansionist tendencies of Russia that are analogous in some sense to the Soviet

01:51.480 --> 01:53.400
Union empire building.

01:53.400 --> 01:59.400
And then the last one, which is the one I got in trouble for, which is Putin's belief

01:59.400 --> 02:05.840
or willingness to manipulate his people into believing that Russia is a salvific force

02:05.840 --> 02:09.000
in the face of idiot Western wokeism.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.400
And that's the one I got in trouble for.

02:10.400 --> 02:16.240
It's like, while you're justifying Putin, it's like, it's not only it's not only the

02:16.240 --> 02:19.480
Russians that think the West has lost its mind.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.360
Eastern Europeans think so too.

02:21.360 --> 02:22.360
And do I know that?

02:22.360 --> 02:30.360
It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries this spring and I talked to 300

02:30.360 --> 02:34.040
political and cultural leaders and you might say, well, they were all conservatives.

02:34.040 --> 02:37.640
It's like, actually, no, they weren't.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.760
Most of them were conservatives because it turns out that they're more willing to talk

02:40.760 --> 02:41.760
to me.

02:41.760 --> 02:49.000
But a good chunk of them were liberals by any stretch of the imagination and a fair

02:49.000 --> 02:51.320
number of them were canceled progressives.

02:51.320 --> 02:59.320
Well, because you're very concerned about the cultural wars that perhaps are a signal

02:59.320 --> 03:07.440
of a possible bad future for this country, for this part of the world, that reason stands

03:07.440 --> 03:08.680
out.

03:08.680 --> 03:17.720
And do you sort of looking back at four reasons think it deserves to have a place in one of

03:17.720 --> 03:18.720
the four?

03:19.440 --> 03:20.440
Absolutely.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.440
Because it is...

03:21.440 --> 03:26.360
Well, the four was bifurcated because I said, look, Putin might believe this.

03:26.360 --> 03:30.000
And I actually think he does because I read a bunch of Putin's speeches and I have been

03:30.000 --> 03:31.880
reading them for 15 years.

03:31.880 --> 03:36.280
And my sense of people generally, and this was true of Hitler, it's like, what did Hitler

03:36.280 --> 03:37.280
believe?

03:37.280 --> 03:39.960
Well, did you read what he wrote?

03:39.960 --> 03:42.040
He just did what he said he was going to do.

03:42.040 --> 03:47.720
And you might think, well, some people are so tricky, they have a whole body of elaborated

03:47.720 --> 03:53.120
speech that's completely separate from their personality and their personality is pursuing

03:53.120 --> 03:54.960
a different agenda.

03:54.960 --> 03:58.360
And this whole body of speech is nothing but a front.

03:58.360 --> 04:02.400
It's like, good luck finding someone that's sophisticated.

04:02.400 --> 04:05.000
First of all, if you say things long enough, you're going to believe them.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.200
That's a really interesting and fascinating and important point.

04:08.200 --> 04:14.720
Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda, I think Hitler is an example of somebody that

04:14.720 --> 04:18.160
I think really quickly you start to believe the propaganda.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.360
Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.

04:21.360 --> 04:24.960
It's like, don't you become what you practice?

04:24.960 --> 04:28.160
And the answer to that is, well, absolutely, we even know the neurology.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.000
It's like when you first formulate a concept, huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so

04:33.000 --> 04:34.160
to speak.

04:34.160 --> 04:38.920
But as you practice that, first of all, the right hemisphere stops participating and

04:38.920 --> 04:45.800
then the left participates less and less until you build specialized machinery for exactly

04:45.800 --> 04:47.960
that conceptual frame.

04:47.960 --> 04:51.240
And then you start to see it, not just think it.

04:51.240 --> 04:55.640
And so if you're telling the same lies over and over, who do you think you're fooling?

04:55.640 --> 05:00.560
Think, well, I can withstand my own lies, not if they're effective lies.

05:00.560 --> 05:05.760
And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people and then they reflect them back

05:05.760 --> 05:10.320
to you, what makes you think you're going to be able to withstand that?

05:10.320 --> 05:11.320
You aren't.

05:11.320 --> 05:17.560
And so I do think Putin believes, to the degree that he believes anything, I do believe that

05:17.560 --> 05:25.760
he thinks of himself as a bulwark for Christendom against the degeneration of the West.

05:25.760 --> 05:30.560
And that's that third way that Dugan and Putin have been talking about, the philosopher

05:30.560 --> 05:33.200
Alexander Dugan and Putin for 15 years.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.720
Now, what that is, is very amorphous.

05:36.720 --> 05:42.960
Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians would have to return to the incremental development of

05:42.960 --> 05:47.160
Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.320
And to some degree, that's happened in Russia because there's been a return to Orthodox

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
Christianity.

05:51.320 --> 05:56.160
Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox Church has just been co-opted by the state.

05:56.160 --> 05:58.000
And I would say there's some evidence for that.

05:58.000 --> 06:05.480
I've heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns, now I don't know if this is true, owns

06:05.480 --> 06:08.480
five billion dollars worth of personal property.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.200
And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.

06:11.200 --> 06:16.160
And it's possible that the Orthodox Church has been co-opted, but there has been somewhat

06:16.160 --> 06:18.600
of an Orthodox revival in Russia.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.400
And I don't think that's all bad.

06:20.400 --> 06:26.360
Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this, if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,

06:26.760 --> 06:31.160
unfortunately, I don't think that's true.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.600
I've read his speeches.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.360
It doesn't look like it to me.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.880
And he is by no means the worst Russian leader of the last 100 years.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.320
Well, there's quite a selection there.

06:41.320 --> 06:48.600
There certainly is, but I say that knowing that, even if he doesn't believe it,

06:50.520 --> 06:52.520
he's convinced his people that it's true.

06:53.400 --> 06:58.280
And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.

06:59.080 --> 07:01.800
And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.

07:01.800 --> 07:07.640
Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.

07:07.640 --> 07:12.760
And a lot of people reached out to me, experts telling me how I should feel,

07:13.720 --> 07:15.320
what I should think about Ukraine.

07:15.960 --> 07:19.720
Oh, you naive Lex, you're so naive.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.560
Here's how it really is.

07:22.200 --> 07:25.960
But then I get to see people that lost their home.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.400
I get to see people on the Russian side who believe they're...

07:30.360 --> 07:34.520
I genuinely think that there's some degree to which they have love in their heart.

07:35.720 --> 07:40.680
They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.

07:40.680 --> 07:43.320
How else would you motivate young men to go fight?

07:43.320 --> 07:49.400
It's just, it's these humans destroying not only their homes,

07:49.400 --> 07:53.960
but creating generational hate, destroying the possibility of love towards each other.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.760
They're basically creating hate.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.520
What I've heard a lot of is on February 24th of this year,

08:01.640 --> 08:05.320
hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.

08:06.280 --> 08:11.240
Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not the soldiers in Russia,

08:11.240 --> 08:17.320
but hate towards all Russians, hate that will last generations.

08:17.320 --> 08:25.240
And then you can see just the pain there.

08:26.360 --> 08:37.000
Then when all these experts talk about agriculture and energy and geopolitics,

08:37.000 --> 08:43.240
and yeah, maybe like what you say with fighting the ideologies of the woke and so on,

08:43.240 --> 08:53.720
I just feel like it's missing something deep that war is not fought about any of those things.

08:54.440 --> 08:59.560
War started and war is averted based on human beings, based on humanity.

08:59.560 --> 09:04.360
Here's another ugly thought since we haven't had enough so far.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.400
We locked everything down for COVID.

09:10.360 --> 09:14.120
How much face-to-face communication was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?

09:14.840 --> 09:15.560
How about none?

09:16.280 --> 09:21.400
How about that was the wrong amount, especially given that Europe was completely dependent on

09:21.400 --> 09:22.920
Putin for its energy supplies?

09:22.920 --> 09:27.640
Well, not completely, but you know what I mean, materially and significantly.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.880
So maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.560
Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble, probably.

09:33.560 --> 09:38.120
And not just an information bubble, how all these experts tell me about-

09:38.680 --> 09:39.720
No, a human bubble.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.080
Look, one of the things I've really learned,

09:43.080 --> 09:46.040
there's a real emphasis on hospitality in the Old Testament.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.960
I just brought all these scholars together to talk about exodus.

09:49.960 --> 09:55.000
Hey, I have this security team with me and they're tough military guys,

09:55.560 --> 09:58.280
but they're on board for this mission, let's say.

09:59.160 --> 10:03.320
And so they went out of their way to be hospitable to my academic guests.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.200
They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.160
They spent all day preparing this house I had rented

10:09.160 --> 10:11.800
so that we could have a hospitable time with these scholars,

10:11.800 --> 10:15.400
most of whom I didn't know well, but who said they would come and spend eight days

10:15.400 --> 10:17.320
talking about this book with me.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.600
We rented some jet skis.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.960
We had a nice house.

10:19.960 --> 10:24.760
We had fun and we got to know each other and we got to trust each other

10:24.760 --> 10:28.280
because we could see that we could have some fun and that we could let our hair down a bit.

10:28.280 --> 10:32.760
We didn't have to be on guard and that made the talks way deeper.

10:32.760 --> 10:36.200
And then we found out we couldn't get through exodus in eight days.

10:36.200 --> 10:40.680
And so I had proposed very early on that we're going to double the length.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.120
And so I pulled eight people out of their lives for eight days.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.840
That's not an easy thing to do.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.440
It's also quite expensive and the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.800
And they said, yes, right away.

10:53.800 --> 10:55.800
So we'd love to do this again.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.760
Well, why?

10:56.760 --> 11:00.600
Well, partly because intellectually it was unbelievably engaging.

11:00.600 --> 11:01.400
I learned so much.

11:01.400 --> 11:05.080
It'll take me like a year to digest it if I can ever digest it.

11:05.880 --> 11:09.720
And but they had, they had a really good time.

11:10.280 --> 11:15.160
And so when they were offered that combination of intellectual challenge,

11:15.160 --> 11:17.400
let's say in hospitality, it was a no-brainer.

11:17.400 --> 11:20.760
They just said, every one of them said, if I can do it in any way,

11:20.760 --> 11:22.200
I will definitely be there.

11:22.200 --> 11:25.000
And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times

11:25.960 --> 11:29.480
and the culture of hospitality has broken down in Washington.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.840
40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.

11:33.400 --> 11:35.000
They don't have apartments.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.360
Their family isn't there with them.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.360
They don't have social occasions with their fellow Democrats or Republicans,

11:42.360 --> 11:43.880
much less across the table.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.880
And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington

11:47.880 --> 11:50.360
that were bilateral a couple of times,

11:50.360 --> 11:54.600
get young Republican congressmen and Democrats together to talk.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.800
And as soon as they talk, they think, oh, it was so interesting

11:57.880 --> 12:01.080
because one of the lunches was about 15 people,

12:01.080 --> 12:03.160
half Democrats and half Republicans.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.960
And all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes talking

12:05.960 --> 12:08.120
about why you decided to become a congressman,

12:08.120 --> 12:10.040
which is not a job I would take, by the way.

12:11.160 --> 12:14.040
You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.

12:14.760 --> 12:16.120
Your family isn't there with you.

12:16.680 --> 12:19.560
You have to run for re-election every two years.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.520
You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?

12:22.520 --> 12:23.880
You're vilified constantly.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.920
This is not, you know, people think,

12:26.920 --> 12:28.680
well, this is a job for the privileged.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.560
It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress

12:31.560 --> 12:33.960
and find out how much fun it is and put your family on the line

12:33.960 --> 12:36.120
and then have to beg for your job every two years.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.520
Well, your enemies, the worst of your enemies

12:38.520 --> 12:42.360
and the worst of your friends are viciously hand-pecking you.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.640
And so anyways, we had them all sit around a table and said,

12:45.640 --> 12:49.480
okay, just say why you ran for Congress.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.320
It was so cool, especially for a Canadian,

12:51.320 --> 12:53.560
because you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.

12:53.560 --> 12:54.760
It's something to watch.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.760
It was like Mr. Smith goes to Washington for every one of them.

12:58.760 --> 13:01.000
It's like, well, this country's given us so much

13:01.000 --> 13:05.240
where families have been so, we've benefited so much

13:05.240 --> 13:07.160
from our time here.

13:07.160 --> 13:08.680
We think this is a wonderful country.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.000
We really felt that we should give back.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.360
Then the next one would talk

13:12.360 --> 13:14.120
and it was like exactly the same story.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.600
And then it didn't matter if they were Republican or Democrat.

13:16.600 --> 13:17.640
You couldn't tell the difference.

13:17.640 --> 13:18.760
No one could.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.800
And was it genuine?

13:19.800 --> 13:22.120
It's like, well, are you genuine?

13:22.120 --> 13:23.720
You think these people are worse than you?

13:25.080 --> 13:26.200
First of all, they're not.

13:27.240 --> 13:31.000
Second of all, they're probably better, all things considered.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.640
It's not that easy to become a congressman.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.040
And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,

13:36.040 --> 13:38.920
but by and large, you walk away from your meetings

13:38.920 --> 13:40.120
with these people and you think.

13:42.840 --> 13:43.880
Pretty impressive.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.120
They really are giving a part of themselves

13:46.120 --> 13:47.480
in the name of service.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.040
Maybe over time, they become cynical

13:50.040 --> 13:54.600
and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.

13:54.600 --> 13:59.080
But I think a lot of it is healed, I think.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.920
And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive,

14:02.920 --> 14:04.200
but not fully.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.400
A lot of it is healed through the power of conversation,

14:07.400 --> 14:09.160
just basic social interaction.

14:10.120 --> 14:13.800
I do think that the effects of this pandemic-

14:13.800 --> 14:14.600
Especially by listening.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.320
Listen, just sitting there,

14:17.320 --> 14:19.960
and it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.080
It's actually humor and all those kinds of things

14:23.880 --> 14:26.760
about personal struggles, all those kinds of things

14:26.760 --> 14:30.520
that remind you that you're all just humans.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.080
Yeah.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.080
Well, the great leaders that I've met,

14:33.080 --> 14:34.360
because I've met some now,

14:35.800 --> 14:37.400
they go listen to their constituents.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.240
It's not a policy discussion.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.520
It's not an ideology discussion.

14:40.520 --> 14:44.200
They go say, okay, what's your life like?

14:44.200 --> 14:45.480
And what are your problems?

14:45.480 --> 14:47.640
And tell me about them.

14:47.640 --> 14:48.600
And then they listen.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.800
And then they're struck by them.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.640
And then they gather up all that misery,

14:51.640 --> 14:54.120
and they bring it to the congressional office

14:54.120 --> 14:55.080
or to the parliament.

14:55.080 --> 14:59.560
And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.

14:59.560 --> 15:03.320
And the good leaders, that's a leader, leader listens.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.800
So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.

15:08.760 --> 15:14.040
And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.640
Being funny, that's hard.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.160
And he said, comedy is the most stand-up comedy,

15:20.200 --> 15:22.760
which is what I do in some real sense.

15:22.760 --> 15:25.320
It's the thing I do that it's most akin

15:25.320 --> 15:27.640
to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.

15:27.640 --> 15:28.680
It's the closest analog.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.640
He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.

15:31.640 --> 15:33.320
And I thought, well, why?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.200
What do you mean?

15:34.200 --> 15:36.120
Because it's just the monologue.

15:36.120 --> 15:38.120
And it's a prepared monologue.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.720
I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience

15:41.720 --> 15:42.760
while you're telling your jokes,

15:42.760 --> 15:43.880
and you've got to get the timing right.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.880
But you have a body of jokes.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.280
He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.

15:49.000 --> 15:51.320
And I've been told this by other comedians.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.720
You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour,

15:54.440 --> 15:56.520
and you got some new material, and you think it's funny.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.440
And you go into a club, and you lay out your new material,

16:00.440 --> 16:02.200
and people laugh at some of it.

16:03.720 --> 16:06.440
And you pay attention to what they laugh at

16:06.440 --> 16:07.560
and what they don't laugh at.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.840
So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.520
And you get rid of everything that isn't funny.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.640
And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,

16:16.360 --> 16:19.000
the crowd will tell you what's funny.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.160
So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows,

16:21.800 --> 16:22.920
and each is an hour long,

16:22.920 --> 16:25.720
and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.880
So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,

16:29.880 --> 16:31.480
more than 98% of it.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.480
You collect two minutes per show.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.120
So you're not very funny at all.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.720
You're like funny 2% of the time.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.800
You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.760
And so that's what a leader does.

16:43.320 --> 16:45.000
That is what a leader does, is he goes out

16:45.000 --> 16:47.880
and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.680
And then I do think that's revivifying

16:51.720 --> 16:53.960
to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded,

16:53.960 --> 16:55.720
because then the person can say to themselves,

16:56.440 --> 16:59.880
despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,

17:00.600 --> 17:04.360
I'm gathering up the misery and the hope,

17:04.360 --> 17:08.440
and I'm bringing it forward where it can be redressed.

17:08.440 --> 17:09.400
Giving it a voice.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.400
Yep, giving it, that's right, giving it a voice.
