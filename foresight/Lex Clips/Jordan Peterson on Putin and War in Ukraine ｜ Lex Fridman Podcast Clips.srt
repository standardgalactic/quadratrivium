1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Let me ask you about the war in Ukraine.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,880
Oh, yeah.

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,240
I got into plenty of trouble about that too.

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,880
You're just a man in a suit talking on microphones and writing brilliant articles.

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,920
There's also people dying, fighting.

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,800
It's their land, it's their country, it's their history.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,520
This is true for both Russia and Ukraine.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,800
There's people trying to ask.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,840
They have many dragons and they're asking themselves the question, who are we?

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,240
What is this?

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,480
What is the future of this nation?

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:49,280
We thought we are a great nation and I think both countries say this and they say, well,

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,200
how do we become the great nation we thought we are?

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,760
So first of all, you got in trouble.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,680
What's the dynamics of the trouble and is it something you regret saying?

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,680
No, no.

17
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,680
I thought about it a lot.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,200
I laid out four reasons for the war and then I was criticized in the Atlantic for the argument

19
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,280
was reduced to one reason, which was a caricature of the reason.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,000
I gave a variety of reasons why the war happened, mismanagement on the part of the West in

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,680
relationship to Russia and foreign policy over the last since the wall fell.

22
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,520
It's understandable because it's extremely complex.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,400
Hyper reliance on Russia as a cardinal source of energy provision for Europe in the wake

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,920
of idiot environmental globalist utopianism.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,480
The expansionist tendencies of Russia that are analogous in some sense to the Soviet

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,400
Union empire building.

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,400
And then the last one, which is the one I got in trouble for, which is Putin's belief

28
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:05,840
or willingness to manipulate his people into believing that Russia is a salvific force

29
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,000
in the face of idiot Western wokeism.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
And that's the one I got in trouble for.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,240
It's like, while you're justifying Putin, it's like, it's not only it's not only the

32
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:19,480
Russians that think the West has lost its mind.

33
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,360
Eastern Europeans think so too.

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
And do I know that?

35
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:30,360
It's like, well, I went to 15 Eastern European countries this spring and I talked to 300

36
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,040
political and cultural leaders and you might say, well, they were all conservatives.

37
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,640
It's like, actually, no, they weren't.

38
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,760
Most of them were conservatives because it turns out that they're more willing to talk

39
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
to me.

40
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:49,000
But a good chunk of them were liberals by any stretch of the imagination and a fair

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,320
number of them were canceled progressives.

42
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:59,320
Well, because you're very concerned about the cultural wars that perhaps are a signal

43
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:07,440
of a possible bad future for this country, for this part of the world, that reason stands

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,680
out.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:17,720
And do you sort of looking back at four reasons think it deserves to have a place in one of

46
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,720
the four?

47
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,440
Absolutely.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,440
Because it is...

49
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,360
Well, the four was bifurcated because I said, look, Putin might believe this.

50
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,000
And I actually think he does because I read a bunch of Putin's speeches and I have been

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,880
reading them for 15 years.

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,280
And my sense of people generally, and this was true of Hitler, it's like, what did Hitler

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
believe?

54
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,960
Well, did you read what he wrote?

55
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,040
He just did what he said he was going to do.

56
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,720
And you might think, well, some people are so tricky, they have a whole body of elaborated

57
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,120
speech that's completely separate from their personality and their personality is pursuing

58
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,960
a different agenda.

59
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,360
And this whole body of speech is nothing but a front.

60
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,400
It's like, good luck finding someone that's sophisticated.

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
First of all, if you say things long enough, you're going to believe them.

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,200
That's a really interesting and fascinating and important point.

63
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:14,720
Even if you start out as a lie, as a propaganda, I think Hitler is an example of somebody that

64
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,160
I think really quickly you start to believe the propaganda.

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,360
Well, you've thought a lot about AI systems.

66
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,960
It's like, don't you become what you practice?

67
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,160
And the answer to that is, well, absolutely, we even know the neurology.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,000
It's like when you first formulate a concept, huge swaths of your cortex are lit up, so

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,160
to speak.

70
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,920
But as you practice that, first of all, the right hemisphere stops participating and

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:45,800
then the left participates less and less until you build specialized machinery for exactly

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,960
that conceptual frame.

73
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,240
And then you start to see it, not just think it.

74
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,640
And so if you're telling the same lies over and over, who do you think you're fooling?

75
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,560
Think, well, I can withstand my own lies, not if they're effective lies.

76
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,760
And if they're effective enough to fool millions of people and then they reflect them back

77
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:10,320
to you, what makes you think you're going to be able to withstand that?

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
You aren't.

79
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,560
And so I do think Putin believes, to the degree that he believes anything, I do believe that

80
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:25,760
he thinks of himself as a bulwark for Christendom against the degeneration of the West.

81
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,560
And that's that third way that Dugan and Putin have been talking about, the philosopher

82
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,200
Alexander Dugan and Putin for 15 years.

83
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,720
Now, what that is, is very amorphous.

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,960
Solzhenitsyn thought the Russians would have to return to the incremental development of

85
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,160
Orthodox Christianity to escape from the communist trap.

86
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,320
And to some degree, that's happened in Russia because there's been a return to Orthodox

87
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Christianity.

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:56,160
Now, you could say, yeah, but the Orthodox Church has just been co-opted by the state.

89
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,000
And I would say there's some evidence for that.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:05,480
I've heard, for example, that the Metropolitan owns, now I don't know if this is true, owns

91
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,480
five billion dollars worth of personal property.

92
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,200
And I would say there's a bit of a moral hazard in that.

93
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:16,160
And it's possible that the Orthodox Church has been co-opted, but there has been somewhat

94
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,600
of an Orthodox revival in Russia.

95
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,400
And I don't think that's all bad.

96
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:26,360
Now, even if Putin doesn't believe any of this, if he's just a psychopathic manipulator,

97
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:31,160
unfortunately, I don't think that's true.

98
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,600
I've read his speeches.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,360
It doesn't look like it to me.

100
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,880
And he is by no means the worst Russian leader of the last 100 years.

101
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,320
Well, there's quite a selection there.

102
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:48,600
There certainly is, but I say that knowing that, even if he doesn't believe it,

103
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
he's convinced his people that it's true.

104
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,280
And so we're stuck with the claim in either case.

105
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,800
And that's the point I was trying to make in the article.

106
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,640
Sometimes I'm troubled by people that explain things.

107
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,760
And a lot of people reached out to me, experts telling me how I should feel,

108
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,320
what I should think about Ukraine.

109
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,720
Oh, you naive Lex, you're so naive.

110
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,560
Here's how it really is.

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,960
But then I get to see people that lost their home.

112
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:29,400
I get to see people on the Russian side who believe they're...

113
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,520
I genuinely think that there's some degree to which they have love in their heart.

114
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,680
They see themselves as heroes saving a land from Nazis.

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,320
How else would you motivate young men to go fight?

116
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,400
It's just, it's these humans destroying not only their homes,

117
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,960
but creating generational hate, destroying the possibility of love towards each other.

118
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,760
They're basically creating hate.

119
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,520
What I've heard a lot of is on February 24th of this year,

120
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,320
hate was born at a scale that region has not seen.

121
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,240
Hate towards not Vladimir Putin, hate towards not the soldiers in Russia,

122
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,320
but hate towards all Russians, hate that will last generations.

123
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:25,240
And then you can see just the pain there.

124
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:37,000
Then when all these experts talk about agriculture and energy and geopolitics,

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,240
and yeah, maybe like what you say with fighting the ideologies of the woke and so on,

126
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:53,720
I just feel like it's missing something deep that war is not fought about any of those things.

127
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,560
War started and war is averted based on human beings, based on humanity.

128
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,360
Here's another ugly thought since we haven't had enough so far.

129
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,400
We locked everything down for COVID.

130
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,120
How much face-to-face communication was there between the West and Vladimir Putin?

131
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,560
How about none?

132
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,400
How about that was the wrong amount, especially given that Europe was completely dependent on

133
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,920
Putin for its energy supplies?

134
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,640
Well, not completely, but you know what I mean, materially and significantly.

135
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,880
So maybe he had to go talk to him once every six months.

136
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,560
Maybe he's in a bit of a bubble, probably.

137
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,120
And not just an information bubble, how all these experts tell me about-

138
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,720
No, a human bubble.

139
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,080
Look, one of the things I've really learned,

140
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,040
there's a real emphasis on hospitality in the Old Testament.

141
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,960
I just brought all these scholars together to talk about exodus.

142
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:55,000
Hey, I have this security team with me and they're tough military guys,

143
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,280
but they're on board for this mission, let's say.

144
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,320
And so they went out of their way to be hospitable to my academic guests.

145
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,200
They laid out nice platters of meat and cheese and crackers.

146
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,160
They spent all day preparing this house I had rented

147
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,800
so that we could have a hospitable time with these scholars,

148
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,400
most of whom I didn't know well, but who said they would come and spend eight days

149
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,320
talking about this book with me.

150
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
We rented some jet skis.

151
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,960
We had a nice house.

152
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,760
We had fun and we got to know each other and we got to trust each other

153
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,280
because we could see that we could have some fun and that we could let our hair down a bit.

154
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,760
We didn't have to be on guard and that made the talks way deeper.

155
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,200
And then we found out we couldn't get through exodus in eight days.

156
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,680
And so I had proposed very early on that we're going to double the length.

157
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,120
And so I pulled eight people out of their lives for eight days.

158
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,840
That's not an easy thing to do.

159
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,440
It's also quite expensive and the Daily Wire Plus people picked all that up.

160
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,800
And they said, yes, right away.

161
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
So we'd love to do this again.

162
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,760
Well, why?

163
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,600
Well, partly because intellectually it was unbelievably engaging.

164
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,400
I learned so much.

165
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,080
It'll take me like a year to digest it if I can ever digest it.

166
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,720
And but they had, they had a really good time.

167
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:15,160
And so when they were offered that combination of intellectual challenge,

168
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,400
let's say in hospitality, it was a no-brainer.

169
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,760
They just said, every one of them said, if I can do it in any way,

170
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,200
I will definitely be there.

171
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
And this, I went to Washington a bunch of times

172
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,480
and the culture of hospitality has broken down in Washington.

173
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,840
40% of congressmen sleep in their offices.

174
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,000
They don't have apartments.

175
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,360
Their family isn't there with them.

176
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,360
They don't have social occasions with their fellow Democrats or Republicans,

177
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
much less across the table.

178
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,880
And so, and I tried to have some meetings in Washington

179
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,360
that were bilateral a couple of times,

180
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,600
get young Republican congressmen and Democrats together to talk.

181
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,800
And as soon as they talk, they think, oh, it was so interesting

182
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,080
because one of the lunches was about 15 people,

183
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,160
half Democrats and half Republicans.

184
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,960
And all I'd asked them to do was just spend three minutes talking

185
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,120
about why you decided to become a congressman,

186
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,040
which is not a job I would take, by the way.

187
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,040
You spend 25 hours a week fundraising on the telephone.

188
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,120
Your family isn't there with you.

189
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,560
You have to run for re-election every two years.

190
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,520
You're beholden to the party apparatus, right?

191
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,880
You're vilified constantly.

192
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,920
This is not, you know, people think,

193
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,680
well, this is a job for the privileged.

194
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,560
It's like, yeah, you go and run for Congress

195
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,960
and find out how much fun it is and put your family on the line

196
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,120
and then have to beg for your job every two years.

197
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,520
Well, your enemies, the worst of your enemies

198
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:42,360
and the worst of your friends are viciously hand-pecking you.

199
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,640
And so anyways, we had them all sit around a table and said,

200
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:49,480
okay, just say why you ran for Congress.

201
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,320
It was so cool, especially for a Canadian,

202
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,560
because you Americans, you're so bloody theatrical.

203
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,760
It's something to watch.

204
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,760
It was like Mr. Smith goes to Washington for every one of them.

205
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:01,000
It's like, well, this country's given us so much

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,240
where families have been so, we've benefited so much

207
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,160
from our time here.

208
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,680
We think this is a wonderful country.

209
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,000
We really felt that we should give back.

210
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,360
Then the next one would talk

211
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,120
and it was like exactly the same story.

212
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,600
And then it didn't matter if they were Republican or Democrat.

213
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,640
You couldn't tell the difference.

214
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,760
No one could.

215
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,800
And was it genuine?

216
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,120
It's like, well, are you genuine?

217
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,720
You think these people are worse than you?

218
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,200
First of all, they're not.

219
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,000
Second of all, they're probably better, all things considered.

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,640
It's not that easy to become a congressman.

221
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,040
And I'm sure there's some bad apples in the bunch,

222
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,920
but by and large, you walk away from your meetings

223
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,120
with these people and you think.

224
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,880
Pretty impressive.

225
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,120
They really are giving a part of themselves

226
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,480
in the name of service.

227
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,040
Maybe over time, they become cynical

228
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,600
and become jaded and worn down by the whole system.

229
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,080
But I think a lot of it is healed, I think.

230
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,920
And I don't think I'm, well, I'm in part naive,

231
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,200
but not fully.

232
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,400
A lot of it is healed through the power of conversation,

233
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,160
just basic social interaction.

234
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,800
I do think that the effects of this pandemic-

235
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,600
Especially by listening.

236
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,320
Listen, just sitting there,

237
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,960
and it doesn't have to be talking about the actual issue.

238
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,080
It's actually humor and all those kinds of things

239
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,760
about personal struggles, all those kinds of things

240
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,520
that remind you that you're all just humans.

241
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,080
Yeah.

242
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Well, the great leaders that I've met,

243
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,360
because I've met some now,

244
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,400
they go listen to their constituents.

245
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,240
It's not a policy discussion.

246
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,520
It's not an ideology discussion.

247
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,200
They go say, okay, what's your life like?

248
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,480
And what are your problems?

249
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,640
And tell me about them.

250
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,600
And then they listen.

251
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,800
And then they're struck by them.

252
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,640
And then they gather up all that misery,

253
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,120
and they bring it to the congressional office

254
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,080
or to the parliament.

255
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:59,560
And they think, here's what the people are crying out for.

256
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:03,320
And the good leaders, that's a leader, leader listens.

257
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,800
So I talked to Jimmy Carr about comedy.

258
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,040
And he's sold out stages worldwide on a tour.

259
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,640
Being funny, that's hard.

260
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,160
And he said, comedy is the most stand-up comedy,

261
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,760
which is what I do in some real sense.

262
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,320
It's the thing I do that it's most akin

263
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,640
to what I'm doing on my book tours, I would say.

264
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:28,680
It's the closest analog.

265
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,640
He said, it's the most dialogical enterprise.

266
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,320
And I thought, well, why?

267
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,200
What do you mean?

268
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,120
Because it's just the monologue.

269
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
And it's a prepared monologue.

270
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,720
I mean, you have to interact dynamically with the audience

271
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,760
while you're telling your jokes,

272
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,880
and you've got to get the timing right.

273
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,880
But you have a body of jokes.

274
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,280
He said, well, here's how you prepare the jokes.

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,320
And I've been told this by other comedians.

276
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,720
You go to 50 clubs before you go on your tour,

277
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,520
and you got some new material, and you think it's funny.

278
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,440
And you go into a club, and you lay out your new material,

279
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,200
and people laugh at some of it.

280
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,440
And you pay attention to what they laugh at

281
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,560
and what they don't laugh at.

282
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,840
So you subject yourself to the judgment of the crowd.

283
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,520
And you get rid of everything that isn't funny.

284
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,640
And if you do that enough, even if you're not that funny,

285
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,000
the crowd will tell you what's funny.

286
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,160
So you can imagine, imagine you do 50 shows,

287
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,920
and each is an hour long,

288
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,720
and you collect two minutes of humor from each show.

289
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,880
So you throw away 90, you throw away two hours,

290
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,480
more than 98% of it.

291
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,480
You collect two minutes per show.

292
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,120
So you're not very funny at all.

293
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,720
You're like funny 2% of the time.

294
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,800
You aggregate that, man, you're a scream.

295
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,760
And so that's what a leader does.

296
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,000
That is what a leader does, is he goes out

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,880
and he aggregates the misery, you know, and the hopes.

298
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,680
And then I do think that's revivifying

299
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,960
to someone who would otherwise be cynical and jaded,

300
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,720
because then the person can say to themselves,

301
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,880
despite the inadequacies of the system and my inadequacies,

302
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,360
I'm gathering up the misery and the hope,

303
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,440
and I'm bringing it forward where it can be redressed.

304
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,400
Giving it a voice.

305
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Yep, giving it, that's right, giving it a voice.
