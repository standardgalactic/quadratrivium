Checking Transcultural Psychiatry/Maxwell Ramstead — A tutorial on active inference.txt
1. **Active Inference**: This is a computational framework used to understand how agents (like humans or animals) make decisions and perceive their environment by minimizing free energy. It combines elements of statistics, physics, and biology.

2. **Variational Free Energy (VFE)**: A concept in active inference that relates to the amount of uncertainty an agent has about its environment or parameters, which can be reduced through perception and action. It's analogous to thermodynamic free energy, where it represents the work potential left in a system.

3. **Markov Blanket**: A set of statistical variables that include parent nodes, children nodes, and the spouses of children nodes, capturing all the information about an entity within a network. In biological terms, this could represent an organism and its immediate environmental factors.

4. **Recursive Nested Systems**: The speaker argues that every component of a Markov Blanketed system itself is a Markov Blanketed system. This recursive nesting applies at all levels of biological organization, from cells to organs to organisms.

5. **Vertical and Horizontal Stacks**: The vertical stack refers to the nested hierarchy of biological systems (cells → organs → organ networks → organism). The horizontal stack involves the interaction of these biological units with their shared environment. Both dimensions are important for understanding life.

6. **Integrated Science of Culture, Mind, and Brain**: The speaker advocates for an integrated approach to studying these aspects of life, suggesting that active inference provides a framework that can unite them. This integration could lead to new insights and advancements in understanding complex biological systems.

7. **Communication and Sharing Generative Models**: In the context of active inference, individual units (like cells) communicate and share generative models to reach a target configuration or morphology efficiently, demonstrating how different levels of organization can be connected.

In essence, the speaker's presentation highlights the importance of understanding biological systems through the lens of information theory and physics-based modeling, as exemplified by the active inference framework. This approach promises to bridge gaps between different scientific domains and provide a more holistic view of life's complexity.
