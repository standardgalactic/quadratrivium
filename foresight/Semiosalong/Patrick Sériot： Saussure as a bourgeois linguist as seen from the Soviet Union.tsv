0	11440	So, hello to everyone, to everyone here and to everyone online, and yeah, well, we are
11440	19800	very happy to have you here for our last session of this Semiosalon series.
19800	28360	And today we have two speakers and we are very, very happy to have one of them here
28360	29920	with us.
29920	34640	We have Professor Patrick Serio and Professor Angeil Tutend, who will be joining online
34640	40320	from Bern, Bern, from Switzerland.
40320	48480	And first we will have Professor Serio and just for a brief introduction, although some
48480	54960	of you might already have heard this introduction from yesterday, Professor Serio.
54960	62320	He studied Slavic and languages and general linguistics at Paris in the Sorbonne.
62320	67320	And his PhD thesis was an analysis of the Soviet political discourse aiming at revealing the
67320	72240	predicate of relations embedded in nominalized, nominal phrases.
72240	79140	And after that he spent some years as a researcher in the Sénérès, in the National Center of
79140	82140	Scientific Research in France.
82140	89700	And eventually he was appointed as an ordinary professor at Lausanne in 1987.
89700	94300	His main field of research and of teaching is the history of linguistics in Russia, the
94300	99740	Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from a comparative and epistemological approach.
99740	105380	And he has many books, he has written many books.
105380	113500	Perhaps the one you might know is this one, Structure and the Whole, East, West and Non-Darwinian
113500	120060	Biology in the origins of structural linguistics, which is really a great book not only because
120060	125540	of the way, not only because of the depth of the research, but also because the way it
125540	126540	is written.
126540	134340	And we had actually, he wrote some review about this book, I think.
134340	140260	And there is a Czech translation, so you have no excuse not to read it, it's wonderful.
140260	148340	And yes, and well, we are really, really very happy to have him here and today he will talk
148340	157660	about the reception of the Soviet Union and well, without further ado, I will give the
157660	170860	floor to Professor Sudev.
170860	200420	Thank you very much, Professor Sudev.
201420	224780	So, yes, now everyone online can see the screen, right?
224780	254700	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
255620	284620	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
285060	310440	I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
310440	317440	and Catholicism are two different variants of the same religion.
320440	325440	Sosir is, of course, an all-common hero.
325440	331440	He's supposed to be the father of general linguistics.
331440	338440	But I think that the negative reception is important.
338440	348440	It is interesting to understand what the arguments were of this negative understanding of Sosir,
348440	363440	because it gives us the possibility to understand more exactly what are the original features of Sosir linguistics.
363440	369440	So, Sosir has been widely read in the Soviet Union.
369440	375440	The first time the Russians heard about the book was by Kartszewski.
375440	388440	In 1917, Kartszewski had been a student in Geneva, but he never listened to the course of general linguistics.
388440	395440	He went only one semester to Sosir's course on Sanskrit.
395440	406440	Nonetheless, he had heard about it by Bayi and Seche, and he did not have the book with himself in Russia,
406440	410440	but he gave a lecture in the Moscow Linguistics Circle.
410440	417440	This was the first time that in Moscow they heard about the existence of Sosir.
417440	426440	Then there was a first translation of the course by Rom,
426440	433440	but Bayi and Seche did not allow him to publish the book, unfortunately,
433440	446440	and the book was more or less read and understood on the manuscript of this first unpublished translation.
446440	461440	And in 1933 was published the first official translation of the book with a total different terminology which I will show to you.
461440	473440	So, I think though most of us, Sosir is the father, is the beginning of everything, but not in Russia.
473440	477440	Why?
477440	483440	First of all, there is something which is rather astonishing for us.
483440	497440	It is that Sosir in the 1930s in the Soviet Union was supposed to be the beginning of the sociological school of linguistics,
497440	512440	the beginning of the French sociological school, which is extremely different from what we know about Sosir being in fact the beginning of structuralism.
512440	527440	So, Soviet Sosir was a social linguist, not even a social thinker in linguistics, absolutely not about structuralism.
527440	549440	The third structure and structuralism was unknown in the 1930s and 40s in the Soviet Union, but Sosir, exactly like Antoine Meier, was supposed to be a social linguist.
549440	566440	Now, you see that if we begin to read Sosir in Russian, then we will have to wonder about the word speech and the difference between speech and language.
566440	589440	And here we begin to move in a very strange atmosphere where the meanings of the words are extremely unstable, especially when we translate from French to Russian and from Russian to French.
589440	608440	See, in the first translation of Sosir, if we have longage, long and parole, then longage was rich, long was music, and there were three different possibilities to translate parole.
608440	628440	Sosir with Gazevanieh is Slava. Slava is interesting. It's just like the same word in Czech, but Slava is more or less like logos in Greek, which has many, many, many meanings at the same time.
628440	653440	So, in the official translation of 1933, the terminology is quite different. And what is important is that rich also exists, but now it means parole, whereas longage becomes Yizhikavaya deity, that is language activity.
653440	676440	Unfortunately, the scientific terminology in Russian has been extremely unstable because, first of all, the tradition of Vilem von Humboldt was overwhelming.
676440	705440	That's quite more important than the tradition of Sosir. So you must understand that those people had two ways of understanding Sosir, away from German romanticism, I mean Humboldt, and of course, the way from Marx and Engels, especially from the German ideology and the origin of the family by Engels.
706440	717440	So we get a very difficult to understand reception of Sosir in those years.
717440	746440	Vimokur was the linguist who was the most open and positively receptive of Sosir, but he also had the so-called sociological approach to Sosorianism, and he writes that for Sosir, the phoneme is Sosir.
747440	769440	Socially significant sound, socially significant signifying sound, means that a society understands the sound from its social attitude.
769440	790440	Of course, this has absolutely nothing in common with Troubet's choism definition or the phoneme. You see, we are inside a sociological understanding of phonology.
790440	814440	Now, what is interesting is that in the Soviet Union, in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, there was a general idea that science is divided into two variants, the bourgeois science and the proletarian science.
814440	836440	So let's say in the beginning Sosir was a social linguist, and then he became a bourgeois linguist. What is bourgeois science? I think that the idea of bourgeois science is really interesting.
837440	861440	Bourgeois science splits and proletarian science gathers. So we have this important overwhelming opposition between what is good, I mean gathering, and what is bad, which is splitting apart.
861440	871440	And here there is a huge misunderstanding about structuralism and holism.
872440	890440	Holism was very spread, very important in the 1930s. Holism is the idea of the body. In the body, all the organs are linked together, they work together.
890440	904440	The organs of the body cannot exist by themselves, but the organs of the body are not the same as the elements of a structure.
904440	925440	So just try to keep in mind this possibility of confusion, of misunderstanding, in the difference between holism and structuralism.
925440	944440	We'll speak about the problem of borders. You see, I try to get a list of all the qualificatives of Sosir in this negative reception.
944440	972440	So Sosir, for all those Soviet linguists, is the man who splits up, who separates. You see, in Sosir for them, we get a strict delimitation, absolute isolation and separation, delineation that limits impenetrable and mutually irreducible fields.
972440	993440	That is, pure splitting up, whereas what is supposed to be good linguistics, on the contrary, is interaction, interpenetration, multilateral approach of language, global and synthetic studying of language in all its complexity,
993440	1015440	blood boundaries and zones of transition, a legacy to the real nature of language acts. This word is important. There are two key words in this Soviet negative reception is nature and essence.
1015440	1039440	It is strange that in this so-called Marxist materialist linguistics, the key words are nature and essence. Very often, you will find sentences like the real nature of the essence of the phenomena.
1039440	1066440	And the real nature of the essence of the phenomena is just precisely a platonic attitude, a platonic worldview, which means that what we see is not reality, the reality is concealed behind what we see.
1066440	1074440	So keep in mind nature and essence of the phenomena.
1075440	1085440	Now, I will show you some examples of what has been said about Saussure, just so that you can believe me.
1085440	1104440	Sherba was a Leningrad important linguist, and he, in 1929, they received the book in Leningrad, and the reaction was clear.
1104440	1126440	Sherba says, Russian linguists knew all this for a long time thanks to Baudouin de Courtenay. So the general idea that there was absolutely nothing new, we, the Russians, knew all that before. We have nothing to learn from them.
1127440	1146440	Now, Polyvanov writes in 1931, this book, received by some as a breakthrough, contains nothing strictly new compared with what was established a long time ago by the school of Baudouin de Courtenay.
1146440	1161440	Of course, we don't have time enough to explain what was peculiar for Baudouin de Courtenay. Nonetheless, please understand that what is important is nothing new.
1161440	1175440	And now, I think, a common hero, Nikolai Trugizkoi, says, I recently re-read Saussure, because all I found in it was old rubbish.
1175440	1202440	So, I do admire Trugizkoi's work, you know, it's so important. So, his consul de phonologie is so beautiful to read, but nonetheless, he did not understand Saussure. He was totally blind to what was new in Saussure.
1205440	1224440	Now, what was understood as a scandal in Saussure was the problem of antinomies. Antinomies should not exist, because if you accept antinomies, you are a bad linguist.
1225440	1240440	Voloshinov, who, please, is not Bakhtin, Voloshinov wrote in 1929 an important book on Marxism and the philosophy of language.
1241440	1260440	And in this book, he says that Saussure is totally assimilated to positivism, abstract objectivism, while Carl Fosler is credited with at least a little humanity. This is individualist subjectivism.
1260440	1285440	This is strange, you see. To think that Saussure is a positivist is a huge misunderstanding, a huge negative reception. And unfortunately, many people who read this book, thinking that Bakhtin had wrote it,
1285440	1296440	did not understand how extremely negative this reading of Saussure was in Voloshinov.
1296440	1313440	We'll have to speak about positivism. Positivism is the way the neo-Granmarians wrote about the history of languages. Positivism is the examinations of single facts.
1313440	1329440	For instance, the sounds are in Sanskrit through the Indo-European languages, which has absolutely nothing to do with the idea of a structure.
1329440	1353440	The second reproach that was done to Saussure was the oblivion of history. Of course, Saussure was interested in synchrony, not in history. But for all those Soviet linguists, this was precisely what they did not admit.
1353440	1372440	You cannot reproach a baker to not to send the fish, of course. Saussure was not interested in history. He was interested in dichrony, which is not the same.
1372440	1383440	Now, what is really interesting, and I think for all the students of first year, it should be clear that a synchrony is not a short dichrony.
1383440	1404440	You see, so, Budagov, for instance, was the main linguist in the Moscow University, was a Romanist. He thinks that at the end of the 19th century, in the Russian language, there was a 30-year synchrony.
1404440	1427440	So for him, synchrony is a sort of static dichrony, where more or less the language does not change. For him, this was a synchrony. There was a static slice of 30 years. This has nothing to do with the synchrony.
1427440	1456440	You see, this is one of the most interesting schemes in Saussure. On page 125, you will find this. This is a cross-section. And a cross-section is used to explain what are the different relationships between the parts of the text.
1456440	1477440	And a cross-section, please understand that it's not a slice. You can eat a little thin slice of carrot, but you cannot eat a cross-section of a carrot. It's impossible, because two dimensions is not the same as three dimensions.
1477440	1493440	And once you mix these two dimensions with three dimensions, then you cannot understand what synchrony is.
1494440	1512440	But if you think that a language is a thing or a living organism, then of course you will not even imagine that you can work with two dimensions.
1513440	1530440	Because you think that a language is something like a plant, like a living organism, then you will think that a synchrony is like a slice and not like a cross-section.
1530440	1545440	So it's obvious that a line has no width and a plane has no thickness. It is a difference of dimensions.
1545440	1563440	Now, all those Soviet linguists were humanists in the meaning that for them life is the explanation of everything, exactly like in romanticism.
1563440	1566440	This is the death of man.
1566440	1578440	You see, Abayev was an admirer of Vilem von Humboldt, like so many Soviet linguists were influenced by Vilem von Humboldt.
1578440	1585440	And Abayev writes from 1934 to 1965,
1585440	1593440	So Syrian structuralism is like modern art, which expels man from the field of knowledge.
1593440	1601440	So Syrian linguistics studies language in and for itself detached from the man who speaks it.
1601440	1611440	Humboldt, in a still and bryonic form, by studying the internal form of language, came close to language as ideology.
1611440	1625440	But we have many things to comment. First, you have this detached, you see, detached or splitting or separating is bad and gathering life is good.
1625440	1632440	But now you have this very important term, which is ideology.
1632440	1643440	For most of the left-wing thinkers in Western Europe, ideology means false consciousness.
1643440	1652440	This is the falsche Bebutstein from Marx in the German ideology, 1846.
1652440	1662440	But ideology here has a totally different meaning, which means precisely semantics.
1662440	1669440	Semantics is the whole amount of ideas that the speakers have in the head.
1669440	1674440	It has nothing to do with a false consciousness.
1674440	1686440	You see, if you think of, for instance, Marxist-Leonid's Gaia Ideologia, the Marxist-Leonidist ideology, of course it is not false consciousness.
1686440	1691440	It is a set of absolutely objective ideas.
1691440	1711440	So please understand that as long as we read texts from other cultures, we have to think that the meaning of the words can be totally different, although it is the same word.
1711440	1722440	So ideology is not false consciousness, but semantics, or the content of what we speak about.
1722440	1731440	So ideology in Voloshinov, in Abayev and in Marx are both social and etymological semantics.
1731440	1744440	This is not ideology in Marx, although all those people pretended to build Marxist linguistics.
1744440	1755440	Now, for one of my heroes, who is Roman Budakov, an intolerable metaphor is the chess gamer.
1756440	1761440	The chess game is a bad metaphor.
1761440	1768440	He writes, chess knows no national differences. The rules are the same for all nations.
1768440	1779440	On the contrary, every natural language is based not only on universal categories, but also on national categories.
1779440	1800440	Now, if you remember what was at stake in Germany at the very end of the 18th century, when Herder Fechter Humboldt began to refuse the philosophy of the Enlightenment,
1800440	1815440	the reproach the Germans made to French was that the Enlightenment was universal, and it did not take into account the national specificity of all the peoples.
1815440	1842440	So in the Soviet Union, which for many people was supposed to have an international ideology, in fact, the main reproach against Saussure was that he did not take into account the national specificity of each language.
1843440	1860440	So of course, in this approach, you cannot translate from one language to the other, because then you will lose this national peculiarity and specificity.
1860440	1866440	Another problem is the mere idea of value.
1867440	1880440	You see, we all know this scheme from Saussure, and this is the signifier and the signified.
1880440	1896440	Now, you remember the metaphor of the sheet of paper. If you cut a sheet of paper, then you will have one side of the paper and the other side will correspond to the third side.
1896440	1910440	That's all he says. But there is a possibility to understand this Saussureian metaphor in the Humboldtian meaning, or more exactly in the Neo-Humboldtian meaning.
1910440	1927440	You see, the Neo-Humboldtianism was very spread in Germany in the 1930s. It is the idea that the words of our language are the content of our thoughts.
1927440	1945440	So it is unfortunately possible to make a Humboldtian reading of Saussure to think that the words we use are the contents of our thoughts.
1945440	1967440	Now, it is obvious that if you accept this idea, if you think that all the speakers of one language have the same thought because they have the same language, then of course you lose the dimension of discourse
1967440	1982440	and you lose the possibility of democracy, which means that people can think differently inside the same language.
1982440	1995440	Now, we have to go now to an epistemological problem. What do we know and how do we know?
1995440	2015440	So the problem is the following. Does the object of knowledge exist before the act of knowing or not? I don't have the solution, but this is a problem which has been discussed from ages and ages.
2015440	2019440	How do we know what we know?
2019440	2040440	So once again, my Buddha, to say that the sole object of linguistic is language in and for itself is incomprehensible to a serious scientist. The purpose of language communication between people is incompatible with this definition.
2040440	2058440	It was the less sentence of the quote by Saussure. The object of linguistic is language in and for itself. And this is what was not acceptable for my Soviet linguists.
2058440	2065440	Now, what is at stake here is a confusing the properties of the model with those of the object.
2066440	2081440	But, once again, we must not forget that language is a profoundly human phenomenon. This is why it is dangerous to view it unilaterally as a system of pure values or of pure science.
2081440	2103440	It is very strange that for most of us, especially if you're interested in semiotics, it is obvious that language is a system of science, but for all of them, a language is not a system of science because it's not a system of pure values.
2104440	2115440	In 1955, the structuralist of Western Europe thought support for the idealistic construction in the logical positivism of the Vienna circle.
2115440	2133440	Once again, we come back to positivism. Positivism is the studying of separated facts, which is not at all the same as a structure for Saussure.
2133440	2146440	Oh, my God, European structuralism considers that two sided signs, consisting of content and expression, exist eminently as an ideal essence.
2146440	2166440	Given in advance in relation to this ideal or eminent sign, what exists in the real world in particular real sound speech is supposed to be no more than a shadow of this idealistically thought outside its realization or manifestation.
2167440	2188440	So we have seen that the reproach to Saussure are splitting apart, and now we come to idealism. What is idealism? It is the separation from between idealism and facts or reality or real life.
2189440	2200440	What they call real nihilists, which is a calc from the German, the Wirkliche Wirkliche.
2201440	2223440	So, for all those subjectly with language is not a system of sign. And I do advise you to read this book by Lenin, materialism and imperial criticism, where he explains that bourgeois ideology is based on science, whereas materialist way of thought,
2223440	2246440	does not accept that language is a system of sign. And if you are interested in semiotics, you must read this book, because it is extremely important. It is the demolishing of all possibility of semiotic.
2246440	2273440	So Saussure denies substance, therefore he is an idealist, and therefore is important here. You see, because for them, the language is a substance, is an essence. It has a nature, and we must figure out what this nature or essence of substance is.
2274440	2278440	And of course the structure is not a substance.
2278440	2298440	This is an idea of matching knowledge to the object to be known. The object is complex, so the description must be complex too. You know that Saussure leaves apart what is not pertinent.
2298440	2309440	He said that in English, I saw pertinence. So he's interested only in what is pertinent for his own point of view.
2309440	2324440	A point of view does not mean arbitrariness. A point of view means that you choose only you select the elements which are useful for what you are looking for.
2325440	2327440	Everything.
2327440	2343440	So I must say that perhaps you remember that Roman Jacobson, my dear Roman Jacobson said that I am a linguist and nothing which is linguistic is alien to me.
2343440	2353440	So Saussure is totally different from that. Only opposite. He leaves apart what is not pertinent for his study.
2353440	2363440	So one of the sentences of Saussure is precisely that the point of view is the object.
2363440	2369440	This is absolutely fantastically interesting.
2369440	2377440	You must have a point of view because it is impossible to know everything at the same time.
2377440	2383440	It is impossible to have an overview of the reality.
2383440	2406440	Perhaps as you are semioticians, you probably know that the Argentine writer Borges wrote a very small novel, which is called Rigor de la Ciencia, where he explained that an emperor asked his geographers to draw
2406440	2411440	a very precise map of the surroundings of the palace.
2411440	2430440	So they took a very thin pencil and they draw every stone of every path, every tree of every forest, but the emperor was not satisfied.
2430440	2434440	He wanted the totally precise map.
2434440	2438440	So what did the geographers do?
2438440	2451440	They decided to draw a map on the scale one to one, which means that one centimeter on the ground is one centimeter on the map.
2451440	2459440	So the problem is that where is this map? It is here. This is precisely the one to one map.
2459440	2469440	It does exist. So it is not useful. It is totally useless to draw a one to one map because it already exists.
2469440	2478440	So a map cannot say everything. It is impossible to reproduce reality.
2478440	2485440	A map is less like language. You have to choose what you are going to speak about.
2485440	2495440	But of course, if you imagine that the point of view is arbitrariness, then of course Tossier is an idealist.
2495440	2501440	So an enemy. So a bourgeois.
2501440	2509440	This sentence only makes sense if it deals with the object of knowledge and not the real object.
2509440	2515440	This is the main core of epistemology.
2515440	2536440	The real object exists without us. The sounds in phonetics do not need the phoneticians to exist, but the phonemes in phonomics in phonology cannot exist without the phonologists.
2536440	2544440	For instance, for one and the same language, you can have different phonemic systems.
2544440	2551440	There was a phonemic school in Leningrad and another one in Moscow.
2551440	2556440	There are totally different ways of explaining the same Russian language.
2556440	2564440	So you see this is important. A phoneme is not a thing. A phoneme does not exist.
2564440	2572440	The sounds are like mushrooms in the forest. The mushrooms exist even if you don't pick them up.
2572440	2591440	But phonemes exist only in our head. And this is what was not understandable if you think that science, the goal of science is to describe reality.
2591440	2600440	So we have this failure of knowledge, the overlap of the object of knowledge by the empirical object.
2600440	2615440	This means that there are people who do not understand the huge difference between a sound and a phoneme between phonetics and phonology.
2615440	2629440	So to conclude, I will say that you are in front of the opposition between epistemology and ontology.
2629440	2635440	Ontology is the science of being, of the real being.
2635440	2642440	Ontology is the core of metaphysics and theology.
2642440	2647440	Epistemology is the science of knowledge.
2647440	2656440	The science of knowledge is not just opening your eyes and see or opening your ears and listen to sounds.
2656440	2664440	Epistemology is the way of building a knowledge of reality.
2664440	2669440	We can speak of immanuel Kant, but we don't have time to do that.
2669440	2682440	So I think I'll begin here. Thank you for your attention.
2682440	2688440	Thank you. Thank you very much for a wonderful, really wonderful talk.
2688440	2696440	Do we have questions from the audience or also from our friends in Zoom?
2696440	2700440	I will stop.
2700440	2707440	So I see we have two messages, but okay.
2707440	2709440	Tufi, ahead.
2709440	2714440	Yes, yes, please.
2715440	2718440	Yes.
2718440	2720440	Can you hear me?
2720440	2722440	Yes.
2722440	2733440	I have a question on Borges. It was really rather nice that you quoted Borges because Prieto did so in 1970, something when he produced Berdé dans ses pratiques.
2733440	2737440	So I think that great minds come together on this object.
2737440	2746440	I have a question on remark rather on translation of lang, langage, and parole.
2746440	2757440	I found exactly the same sort of problem when examining the reviews of the CLG, the course of in general linguistics, in English.
2757440	2766440	And some people call speech, parole, but some people call speech, langage, which means that it makes things very difficult.
2766440	2774440	Have you come across the same sort of thing in this sort of field?
2774440	2776440	Have you heard me?
2776440	2784440	I'm sorry, I have a problem with my ears, but I did not understand what you said.
2784440	2790440	There is a problem between translating from French to English.
2790440	2796440	Yes, yes, yes, you are right. This is precisely, I do understand what you speak about.
2796440	2808440	But it is true that the problem is that lang and langage are two extremely different notions, which thanks to Saussure, we began to understand them.
2808440	2820440	And it is true that in English language and in German Sprache, and in Russian music, give the possibility of a great confusion.
2820440	2831440	But there are always possibilities to invent a new terminology. So it should not be a problem.
2831440	2855440	Nonetheless, in Russian, the word язык, and at times речь, and at times слово, is neither long nor language, but a strange mixture of both long and langage.
2855440	2864440	And it is a third notion, which is neither long nor longage. Yes, you are right. This is a problem.
2864440	2866440	Okay, thank you.
2866440	2869440	You're welcome.
2869440	2875440	Thank you. And we have questions from the audience here.
2875440	2886440	Please.
2886440	2895440	Okay, thank you very much for your talk.
2895440	2904440	So I appreciated your explanation of the difference between the synchrony and the static state.
2904440	2921440	And I was just wondering, because the example that you showed us with the crosscut is actually a picture of a plant cut across, but then you said that we cannot do like synchrony research about living beings.
2921440	2929440	And if we understand language as a living organism, we cannot do the real synchrony.
2929440	2941440	I'm not sure if I understood correctly, but my question was, if really this is so because actually, even sister, he used example of a plant which is a living organism.
2941440	2950440	Well, you have the right, of course, to consider that language is a living organism.
2950440	2959440	I think that a language is not a living organism. And then what can we do?
2959440	2974440	The talk is finished. You see, no, it's not the problem that language is or not an organism. It is the problem that what is the object of knowledge that we build.
2974440	2986440	Of course, languages do not need linguists to exist. They just exist by themselves. There's no problem. We are totally useless for languages.
2986440	3007440	But if we want to learn something to see to understand something about how languages work. So I think that the analogy between languages and organism is bad analogy.
3007440	3017440	It does not, it's not useful to build a theory of linguistics.
3017440	3031440	Nonetheless, if you want languages to be a living organism, please do. And now we'll have to compare what are your results and what are minds.
3032440	3034440	That's all. Please do.
3034440	3037440	No, I don't necessarily want to.
3037440	3047440	This is like a foreign language as a living organism. But I was just wondering, if we admit that language could be understood as living organism, we can still do some chronic research.
3047440	3056440	Like, yeah, I don't see a necessarily contradiction there. That was only my point. But I understand what you're saying.
3056440	3075440	You see, if we decide to study languages as organism, then we cannot make a difference between synchrony and a short dichrony.
3075440	3094440	It loses this possibility. So we have to abandon so sure. And we will be quite nearer, let's say Humboldt or Fossler or people like that. Why not.
3094440	3100440	They have a certain charm I like romanticism. Why not. But it's not the same.
3100440	3127440	And from an epistemological point of view, I think that the idea that the point of view creates the object is more is more useful that you can understand more than if you of course you have the right but if that then if you
3127440	3131440	have the language is an organism.
3131440	3138440	And I must say that this is an old 19th century idea.
3138440	3145440	Sorry.
3145440	3154440	This is the name.
3154440	3164440	But do we have more questions from the audience, or from people in zoom. I see some people there in some who could say a big deal about the relationships between
3165440	3171440	linguistics and biology and organic system, but not.
3171440	3174440	Maybe I have a small question.
3174440	3190440	Could you elaborate a little bit on this distinction between history and dichrony, because also in the course in so sure there is some talk about history as something that depends on human actions.
3190440	3202440	Because I think this, this idea of history was also used by, by Prieto, for instance, and by other linguists. But yeah, how do you see this difference between history and dichrony.
3202440	3212440	And how would it relate to to arbitrariness to arbitrariness if it relates.
3212440	3225440	So many people have spoken about arbitrariness that I shouldn't dare begin this discussion.
3225440	3247440	But arbitrariness has been understood as a sort of fantasy, as a sort of subjectiveness, but arbitrariness is just the idea that there is no motivated relationship between the signifier and the signifier.
3247440	3274440	That's all. Unfortunately, our hero, so sure, makes a mistake when he explains that ox and buff are different signified, they are not signified, they are objects of reality, and this has been the source of many, many misunderstandings.
3274440	3295440	Now, history and dichrony. Dichrony is a point of view, whereas history exists without us. Dichrony is belongs inside a specific science.
3295440	3311440	Dichrony does not exist. Asynchrony does not exist either. They are points of view. But history does exist. This is absolutely, this is real life.
3311440	3326440	In the, the object of discussion is between epistemology and ontology. So, let's forget history. History was the main objective of the neo grammarians.
3326440	3348440	They were inside the history. And the whole 19th century was fascinated by history. And it was all from Heber, Fischer, Schlagen, Schleicher, all even Antoine Meier, all were fascinated by history.
3348440	3367440	And they thought that real science must, cannot, not be historical. Now, what was revolutionary in Saussure was not at all that he dealt with static situation, not at all.
3367440	3381440	Synchrony is not static. Synchrony is a point of view when you select, especially what you want to speak about, and nothing else.
3382440	3387440	We have a raised hand from Professor Joseph. Please.
3387440	3399440	Hello, Patrick. Thank you very much. It was, it was a great paper and I was particularly happy. I suppose relieved. I don't know. I was, I was anyway intrigued to hear you refer to.
3399440	3416440	You said my dear Roman Jacobson, and I've never been sure, especially since reading your book structure in the whole, which I made. I was very lucky to be able to refer to in my talk to, to this group at the start of the semester.
3416440	3434440	But you are ambivalent about your dear Roman Jacobson, aren't you? I mean, I'm ambivalent about my dear wife and children. So it would be a normal thing to expect, but I just like to hear you say a little bit about your view of Roman Jacobson.
3435440	3437440	Yes, I didn't hear.
3437440	3452440	He said he was impressed about you even referred to Roman Jacobson as your dear Roman, Roman Jacobson. So he would like you to expand on why is it dear for you, Roman Jacobson.
3452440	3466440	It's like, you know, Roman Jacobson, because Roman Jacobson was perhaps the only linguist with a sense of humor. Once a journalist asked him, Mr. Jacobson, how many wives did you have?
3466440	3494440	And he said, do you mean in dichrony or in synchrony? So that's why I like Roman Jacobson. Now, he had a whole fantasy. And, of course, I know that he was a slavophile, that he did not understand, so sure, that he was
3494440	3508440	he invented a Russian culture which did not exist. But nonetheless, we are all thankful to Jacobson for his fantasy, for bringing fantasy into linguistics.
3510440	3513440	Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And
3518440	3520440	Professor Kallavi, hello.
3520440	3522440	Hello.
3522440	3526440	Do you have something to add? Because we were wondering.
3526440	3552440	So that's so nice and so good to see all you have there. Again, arbitrariness, you said, you don't want to tell about that, but you may know that Israel has formulated the definition of semiotics as
3553440	3563440	studying everything, what is arbitrary, more or less like this, yeah? Israel, you can confirm.
3564440	3590440	All aspects of arbitrariness, that is the object for semiotics. But here, the same thing, how arbitrariness and motivativeness are related. I still think that when Saussure first says that principle number one is that language is arbitrary.
3590440	3619440	And further on, he just somehow becomes not so clear anymore when he is starting to speak about motivativeness. Motivatedness should be understood as just some kind of restrictions or constraints to arbitrariness.
3620440	3645440	But not really opposite to it. I think that is very, very important difference now, whether arbitrariness and motivativeness are opposites or this motivativeness is simply restriction for arbitrariness.
3646440	3658440	So, yeah, if you comment on that would be nice. Otherwise, we just will have this discussion later.
3659440	3671440	So he was talking about the distinction between motivativeness and arbitrariness and saying motivativeness as a sort of restriction of arbitrariness and whether you could comment on that.
3671440	3683440	Calibri, I don't agree with you. I think that arbitrariness and motivation are extremely different.
3683440	3710440	Motivation, it means that you have an intrinsic link between a signifier and signified, and motivation does exist in some parts. For instance, I don't know to paint painting, it's obvious that those three words have a relationship of motivation.
3710440	3731440	Because painting has absolutely no motivation with the act of painting. So arbitrariness means the total absence of possible link. So, no, I don't think that motivation is a part of arbitrariness, not at all.
3731440	3737440	Yes, nice to see you.
3737440	3741440	Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks to all of you.
3741440	3755440	And now I think, yes, we can.
3755440	3759440	So now we will stop recording.
