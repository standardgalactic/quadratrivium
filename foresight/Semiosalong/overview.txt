Checking Semiosalong/Patrick Sériot： Saussure as a bourgeois linguist as seen from the Soviet Union.txt
1. **Neo-Grammarians and History**: The Neo-Grammarians in the 19th century were deeply focused on history, contrasting with Ferdinand de Saussure's approach to linguistics which emphasized a synchronic perspective—focusing on language as a system at a particular point in time rather than its historical development.

2. **Saussure's Synchronic Approach**: Saussure's groundbreaking work was not necessarily revolutionary in advocating for the study of language at a single moment (synchronic linguistics). However, his emphasis on this approach was indeed significant because it shifted the focus away from diachronic (historical) linguistics.

3. **Synchrony and Static**: Synchrony is not about static snapshots but rather about selecting a specific point of reference within a dynamic system for analysis purposes.

4. **Roman Jakobson's Contributions**: Roman Jakobson was appreciated by Patrick Hanks for his sense of humor and for introducing fantasy into linguistics. Jakobson's contributions, including his inventive ideas about Russian culture, are valued even if not entirely factual.

5. **Semiotics and Arbitrariness**: Semiotics studies everything related to arbitrariness, as defined by Louis Hjelmslev and later by Roman Jakobson. Arbitrariness refers to the lack of inherent connection between the signifier (form) and the signified (concept).

6. **Arbitrariness vs. Motivation**: There was a discussion about whether motivation is a form of constraint on arbitrariness or if it is an opposite concept. The consensus in the conversation seemed to be that motivation involves an intrinsic link between the signifier and the signified, which is not present in arbitrary signs. Arbitrariness is the absence of any such link, and motivation cannot be considered a part of arbitrariness.

The session concluded with a lively discussion on the relationship between arbitrariness and motivation in the field of semiotics and linguistics.
