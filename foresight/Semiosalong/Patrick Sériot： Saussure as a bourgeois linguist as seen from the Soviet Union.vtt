WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.440
So, hello to everyone, to everyone here and to everyone online, and yeah, well, we are

00:11.440 --> 00:19.800
very happy to have you here for our last session of this Semiosalon series.

00:19.800 --> 00:28.360
And today we have two speakers and we are very, very happy to have one of them here

00:28.360 --> 00:29.920
with us.

00:29.920 --> 00:34.640
We have Professor Patrick Serio and Professor Angeil Tutend, who will be joining online

00:34.640 --> 00:40.320
from Bern, Bern, from Switzerland.

00:40.320 --> 00:48.480
And first we will have Professor Serio and just for a brief introduction, although some

00:48.480 --> 00:54.960
of you might already have heard this introduction from yesterday, Professor Serio.

00:54.960 --> 01:02.320
He studied Slavic and languages and general linguistics at Paris in the Sorbonne.

01:02.320 --> 01:07.320
And his PhD thesis was an analysis of the Soviet political discourse aiming at revealing the

01:07.320 --> 01:12.240
predicate of relations embedded in nominalized, nominal phrases.

01:12.240 --> 01:19.140
And after that he spent some years as a researcher in the Sénérès, in the National Center of

01:19.140 --> 01:22.140
Scientific Research in France.

01:22.140 --> 01:29.700
And eventually he was appointed as an ordinary professor at Lausanne in 1987.

01:29.700 --> 01:34.300
His main field of research and of teaching is the history of linguistics in Russia, the

01:34.300 --> 01:39.740
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from a comparative and epistemological approach.

01:39.740 --> 01:45.380
And he has many books, he has written many books.

01:45.380 --> 01:53.500
Perhaps the one you might know is this one, Structure and the Whole, East, West and Non-Darwinian

01:53.500 --> 02:00.060
Biology in the origins of structural linguistics, which is really a great book not only because

02:00.060 --> 02:05.540
of the way, not only because of the depth of the research, but also because the way it

02:05.540 --> 02:06.540
is written.

02:06.540 --> 02:14.340
And we had actually, he wrote some review about this book, I think.

02:14.340 --> 02:20.260
And there is a Czech translation, so you have no excuse not to read it, it's wonderful.

02:20.260 --> 02:28.340
And yes, and well, we are really, really very happy to have him here and today he will talk

02:28.340 --> 02:37.660
about the reception of the Soviet Union and well, without further ado, I will give the

02:37.660 --> 02:50.860
floor to Professor Sudev.

02:50.860 --> 03:20.420
Thank you very much, Professor Sudev.

03:21.420 --> 03:44.780
So, yes, now everyone online can see the screen, right?

03:44.780 --> 04:14.700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

04:15.620 --> 04:44.620
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

04:45.060 --> 05:10.440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:10.440 --> 05:17.440
and Catholicism are two different variants of the same religion.

05:20.440 --> 05:25.440
Sosir is, of course, an all-common hero.

05:25.440 --> 05:31.440
He's supposed to be the father of general linguistics.

05:31.440 --> 05:38.440
But I think that the negative reception is important.

05:38.440 --> 05:48.440
It is interesting to understand what the arguments were of this negative understanding of Sosir,

05:48.440 --> 06:03.440
because it gives us the possibility to understand more exactly what are the original features of Sosir linguistics.

06:03.440 --> 06:09.440
So, Sosir has been widely read in the Soviet Union.

06:09.440 --> 06:15.440
The first time the Russians heard about the book was by Kartszewski.

06:15.440 --> 06:28.440
In 1917, Kartszewski had been a student in Geneva, but he never listened to the course of general linguistics.

06:28.440 --> 06:35.440
He went only one semester to Sosir's course on Sanskrit.

06:35.440 --> 06:46.440
Nonetheless, he had heard about it by Bayi and Seche, and he did not have the book with himself in Russia,

06:46.440 --> 06:50.440
but he gave a lecture in the Moscow Linguistics Circle.

06:50.440 --> 06:57.440
This was the first time that in Moscow they heard about the existence of Sosir.

06:57.440 --> 07:06.440
Then there was a first translation of the course by Rom,

07:06.440 --> 07:13.440
but Bayi and Seche did not allow him to publish the book, unfortunately,

07:13.440 --> 07:26.440
and the book was more or less read and understood on the manuscript of this first unpublished translation.

07:26.440 --> 07:41.440
And in 1933 was published the first official translation of the book with a total different terminology which I will show to you.

07:41.440 --> 07:53.440
So, I think though most of us, Sosir is the father, is the beginning of everything, but not in Russia.

07:53.440 --> 07:57.440
Why?

07:57.440 --> 08:03.440
First of all, there is something which is rather astonishing for us.

08:03.440 --> 08:17.440
It is that Sosir in the 1930s in the Soviet Union was supposed to be the beginning of the sociological school of linguistics,

08:17.440 --> 08:32.440
the beginning of the French sociological school, which is extremely different from what we know about Sosir being in fact the beginning of structuralism.

08:32.440 --> 08:47.440
So, Soviet Sosir was a social linguist, not even a social thinker in linguistics, absolutely not about structuralism.

08:47.440 --> 09:09.440
The third structure and structuralism was unknown in the 1930s and 40s in the Soviet Union, but Sosir, exactly like Antoine Meier, was supposed to be a social linguist.

09:09.440 --> 09:26.440
Now, you see that if we begin to read Sosir in Russian, then we will have to wonder about the word speech and the difference between speech and language.

09:26.440 --> 09:49.440
And here we begin to move in a very strange atmosphere where the meanings of the words are extremely unstable, especially when we translate from French to Russian and from Russian to French.

09:49.440 --> 10:08.440
See, in the first translation of Sosir, if we have longage, long and parole, then longage was rich, long was music, and there were three different possibilities to translate parole.

10:08.440 --> 10:28.440
Sosir with Gazevanieh is Slava. Slava is interesting. It's just like the same word in Czech, but Slava is more or less like logos in Greek, which has many, many, many meanings at the same time.

10:28.440 --> 10:53.440
So, in the official translation of 1933, the terminology is quite different. And what is important is that rich also exists, but now it means parole, whereas longage becomes Yizhikavaya deity, that is language activity.

10:53.440 --> 11:16.440
Unfortunately, the scientific terminology in Russian has been extremely unstable because, first of all, the tradition of Vilem von Humboldt was overwhelming.

11:16.440 --> 11:45.440
That's quite more important than the tradition of Sosir. So you must understand that those people had two ways of understanding Sosir, away from German romanticism, I mean Humboldt, and of course, the way from Marx and Engels, especially from the German ideology and the origin of the family by Engels.

11:46.440 --> 11:57.440
So we get a very difficult to understand reception of Sosir in those years.

11:57.440 --> 12:26.440
Vimokur was the linguist who was the most open and positively receptive of Sosir, but he also had the so-called sociological approach to Sosorianism, and he writes that for Sosir, the phoneme is Sosir.

12:27.440 --> 12:49.440
Socially significant sound, socially significant signifying sound, means that a society understands the sound from its social attitude.

12:49.440 --> 13:10.440
Of course, this has absolutely nothing in common with Troubet's choism definition or the phoneme. You see, we are inside a sociological understanding of phonology.

13:10.440 --> 13:34.440
Now, what is interesting is that in the Soviet Union, in the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, there was a general idea that science is divided into two variants, the bourgeois science and the proletarian science.

13:34.440 --> 13:56.440
So let's say in the beginning Sosir was a social linguist, and then he became a bourgeois linguist. What is bourgeois science? I think that the idea of bourgeois science is really interesting.

13:57.440 --> 14:21.440
Bourgeois science splits and proletarian science gathers. So we have this important overwhelming opposition between what is good, I mean gathering, and what is bad, which is splitting apart.

14:21.440 --> 14:31.440
And here there is a huge misunderstanding about structuralism and holism.

14:32.440 --> 14:50.440
Holism was very spread, very important in the 1930s. Holism is the idea of the body. In the body, all the organs are linked together, they work together.

14:50.440 --> 15:04.440
The organs of the body cannot exist by themselves, but the organs of the body are not the same as the elements of a structure.

15:04.440 --> 15:25.440
So just try to keep in mind this possibility of confusion, of misunderstanding, in the difference between holism and structuralism.

15:25.440 --> 15:44.440
We'll speak about the problem of borders. You see, I try to get a list of all the qualificatives of Sosir in this negative reception.

15:44.440 --> 16:12.440
So Sosir, for all those Soviet linguists, is the man who splits up, who separates. You see, in Sosir for them, we get a strict delimitation, absolute isolation and separation, delineation that limits impenetrable and mutually irreducible fields.

16:12.440 --> 16:33.440
That is, pure splitting up, whereas what is supposed to be good linguistics, on the contrary, is interaction, interpenetration, multilateral approach of language, global and synthetic studying of language in all its complexity,

16:33.440 --> 16:55.440
blood boundaries and zones of transition, a legacy to the real nature of language acts. This word is important. There are two key words in this Soviet negative reception is nature and essence.

16:55.440 --> 17:19.440
It is strange that in this so-called Marxist materialist linguistics, the key words are nature and essence. Very often, you will find sentences like the real nature of the essence of the phenomena.

17:19.440 --> 17:46.440
And the real nature of the essence of the phenomena is just precisely a platonic attitude, a platonic worldview, which means that what we see is not reality, the reality is concealed behind what we see.

17:46.440 --> 17:54.440
So keep in mind nature and essence of the phenomena.

17:55.440 --> 18:05.440
Now, I will show you some examples of what has been said about Saussure, just so that you can believe me.

18:05.440 --> 18:24.440
Sherba was a Leningrad important linguist, and he, in 1929, they received the book in Leningrad, and the reaction was clear.

18:24.440 --> 18:46.440
Sherba says, Russian linguists knew all this for a long time thanks to Baudouin de Courtenay. So the general idea that there was absolutely nothing new, we, the Russians, knew all that before. We have nothing to learn from them.

18:47.440 --> 19:06.440
Now, Polyvanov writes in 1931, this book, received by some as a breakthrough, contains nothing strictly new compared with what was established a long time ago by the school of Baudouin de Courtenay.

19:06.440 --> 19:21.440
Of course, we don't have time enough to explain what was peculiar for Baudouin de Courtenay. Nonetheless, please understand that what is important is nothing new.

19:21.440 --> 19:35.440
And now, I think, a common hero, Nikolai Trugizkoi, says, I recently re-read Saussure, because all I found in it was old rubbish.

19:35.440 --> 20:02.440
So, I do admire Trugizkoi's work, you know, it's so important. So, his consul de phonologie is so beautiful to read, but nonetheless, he did not understand Saussure. He was totally blind to what was new in Saussure.

20:05.440 --> 20:24.440
Now, what was understood as a scandal in Saussure was the problem of antinomies. Antinomies should not exist, because if you accept antinomies, you are a bad linguist.

20:25.440 --> 20:40.440
Voloshinov, who, please, is not Bakhtin, Voloshinov wrote in 1929 an important book on Marxism and the philosophy of language.

20:41.440 --> 21:00.440
And in this book, he says that Saussure is totally assimilated to positivism, abstract objectivism, while Carl Fosler is credited with at least a little humanity. This is individualist subjectivism.

21:00.440 --> 21:25.440
This is strange, you see. To think that Saussure is a positivist is a huge misunderstanding, a huge negative reception. And unfortunately, many people who read this book, thinking that Bakhtin had wrote it,

21:25.440 --> 21:36.440
did not understand how extremely negative this reading of Saussure was in Voloshinov.

21:36.440 --> 21:53.440
We'll have to speak about positivism. Positivism is the way the neo-Granmarians wrote about the history of languages. Positivism is the examinations of single facts.

21:53.440 --> 22:09.440
For instance, the sounds are in Sanskrit through the Indo-European languages, which has absolutely nothing to do with the idea of a structure.

22:09.440 --> 22:33.440
The second reproach that was done to Saussure was the oblivion of history. Of course, Saussure was interested in synchrony, not in history. But for all those Soviet linguists, this was precisely what they did not admit.

22:33.440 --> 22:52.440
You cannot reproach a baker to not to send the fish, of course. Saussure was not interested in history. He was interested in dichrony, which is not the same.

22:52.440 --> 23:03.440
Now, what is really interesting, and I think for all the students of first year, it should be clear that a synchrony is not a short dichrony.

23:03.440 --> 23:24.440
You see, so, Budagov, for instance, was the main linguist in the Moscow University, was a Romanist. He thinks that at the end of the 19th century, in the Russian language, there was a 30-year synchrony.

23:24.440 --> 23:47.440
So for him, synchrony is a sort of static dichrony, where more or less the language does not change. For him, this was a synchrony. There was a static slice of 30 years. This has nothing to do with the synchrony.

23:47.440 --> 24:16.440
You see, this is one of the most interesting schemes in Saussure. On page 125, you will find this. This is a cross-section. And a cross-section is used to explain what are the different relationships between the parts of the text.

24:16.440 --> 24:37.440
And a cross-section, please understand that it's not a slice. You can eat a little thin slice of carrot, but you cannot eat a cross-section of a carrot. It's impossible, because two dimensions is not the same as three dimensions.

24:37.440 --> 24:53.440
And once you mix these two dimensions with three dimensions, then you cannot understand what synchrony is.

24:54.440 --> 25:12.440
But if you think that a language is a thing or a living organism, then of course you will not even imagine that you can work with two dimensions.

25:13.440 --> 25:30.440
Because you think that a language is something like a plant, like a living organism, then you will think that a synchrony is like a slice and not like a cross-section.

25:30.440 --> 25:45.440
So it's obvious that a line has no width and a plane has no thickness. It is a difference of dimensions.

25:45.440 --> 26:03.440
Now, all those Soviet linguists were humanists in the meaning that for them life is the explanation of everything, exactly like in romanticism.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.440
This is the death of man.

26:06.440 --> 26:18.440
You see, Abayev was an admirer of Vilem von Humboldt, like so many Soviet linguists were influenced by Vilem von Humboldt.

26:18.440 --> 26:25.440
And Abayev writes from 1934 to 1965,

26:25.440 --> 26:33.440
So Syrian structuralism is like modern art, which expels man from the field of knowledge.

26:33.440 --> 26:41.440
So Syrian linguistics studies language in and for itself detached from the man who speaks it.

26:41.440 --> 26:51.440
Humboldt, in a still and bryonic form, by studying the internal form of language, came close to language as ideology.

26:51.440 --> 27:05.440
But we have many things to comment. First, you have this detached, you see, detached or splitting or separating is bad and gathering life is good.

27:05.440 --> 27:12.440
But now you have this very important term, which is ideology.

27:12.440 --> 27:23.440
For most of the left-wing thinkers in Western Europe, ideology means false consciousness.

27:23.440 --> 27:32.440
This is the falsche Bebutstein from Marx in the German ideology, 1846.

27:32.440 --> 27:42.440
But ideology here has a totally different meaning, which means precisely semantics.

27:42.440 --> 27:49.440
Semantics is the whole amount of ideas that the speakers have in the head.

27:49.440 --> 27:54.440
It has nothing to do with a false consciousness.

27:54.440 --> 28:06.440
You see, if you think of, for instance, Marxist-Leonid's Gaia Ideologia, the Marxist-Leonidist ideology, of course it is not false consciousness.

28:06.440 --> 28:11.440
It is a set of absolutely objective ideas.

28:11.440 --> 28:31.440
So please understand that as long as we read texts from other cultures, we have to think that the meaning of the words can be totally different, although it is the same word.

28:31.440 --> 28:42.440
So ideology is not false consciousness, but semantics, or the content of what we speak about.

28:42.440 --> 28:51.440
So ideology in Voloshinov, in Abayev and in Marx are both social and etymological semantics.

28:51.440 --> 29:04.440
This is not ideology in Marx, although all those people pretended to build Marxist linguistics.

29:04.440 --> 29:15.440
Now, for one of my heroes, who is Roman Budakov, an intolerable metaphor is the chess gamer.

29:16.440 --> 29:21.440
The chess game is a bad metaphor.

29:21.440 --> 29:28.440
He writes, chess knows no national differences. The rules are the same for all nations.

29:28.440 --> 29:39.440
On the contrary, every natural language is based not only on universal categories, but also on national categories.

29:39.440 --> 30:00.440
Now, if you remember what was at stake in Germany at the very end of the 18th century, when Herder Fechter Humboldt began to refuse the philosophy of the Enlightenment,

30:00.440 --> 30:15.440
the reproach the Germans made to French was that the Enlightenment was universal, and it did not take into account the national specificity of all the peoples.

30:15.440 --> 30:42.440
So in the Soviet Union, which for many people was supposed to have an international ideology, in fact, the main reproach against Saussure was that he did not take into account the national specificity of each language.

30:43.440 --> 31:00.440
So of course, in this approach, you cannot translate from one language to the other, because then you will lose this national peculiarity and specificity.

31:00.440 --> 31:06.440
Another problem is the mere idea of value.

31:07.440 --> 31:20.440
You see, we all know this scheme from Saussure, and this is the signifier and the signified.

31:20.440 --> 31:36.440
Now, you remember the metaphor of the sheet of paper. If you cut a sheet of paper, then you will have one side of the paper and the other side will correspond to the third side.

31:36.440 --> 31:50.440
That's all he says. But there is a possibility to understand this Saussureian metaphor in the Humboldtian meaning, or more exactly in the Neo-Humboldtian meaning.

31:50.440 --> 32:07.440
You see, the Neo-Humboldtianism was very spread in Germany in the 1930s. It is the idea that the words of our language are the content of our thoughts.

32:07.440 --> 32:25.440
So it is unfortunately possible to make a Humboldtian reading of Saussure to think that the words we use are the contents of our thoughts.

32:25.440 --> 32:47.440
Now, it is obvious that if you accept this idea, if you think that all the speakers of one language have the same thought because they have the same language, then of course you lose the dimension of discourse

32:47.440 --> 33:02.440
and you lose the possibility of democracy, which means that people can think differently inside the same language.

33:02.440 --> 33:15.440
Now, we have to go now to an epistemological problem. What do we know and how do we know?

33:15.440 --> 33:35.440
So the problem is the following. Does the object of knowledge exist before the act of knowing or not? I don't have the solution, but this is a problem which has been discussed from ages and ages.

33:35.440 --> 33:39.440
How do we know what we know?

33:39.440 --> 34:00.440
So once again, my Buddha, to say that the sole object of linguistic is language in and for itself is incomprehensible to a serious scientist. The purpose of language communication between people is incompatible with this definition.

34:00.440 --> 34:18.440
It was the less sentence of the quote by Saussure. The object of linguistic is language in and for itself. And this is what was not acceptable for my Soviet linguists.

34:18.440 --> 34:25.440
Now, what is at stake here is a confusing the properties of the model with those of the object.

34:26.440 --> 34:41.440
But, once again, we must not forget that language is a profoundly human phenomenon. This is why it is dangerous to view it unilaterally as a system of pure values or of pure science.

34:41.440 --> 35:03.440
It is very strange that for most of us, especially if you're interested in semiotics, it is obvious that language is a system of science, but for all of them, a language is not a system of science because it's not a system of pure values.

35:04.440 --> 35:15.440
In 1955, the structuralist of Western Europe thought support for the idealistic construction in the logical positivism of the Vienna circle.

35:15.440 --> 35:33.440
Once again, we come back to positivism. Positivism is the studying of separated facts, which is not at all the same as a structure for Saussure.

35:33.440 --> 35:46.440
Oh, my God, European structuralism considers that two sided signs, consisting of content and expression, exist eminently as an ideal essence.

35:46.440 --> 36:06.440
Given in advance in relation to this ideal or eminent sign, what exists in the real world in particular real sound speech is supposed to be no more than a shadow of this idealistically thought outside its realization or manifestation.

36:07.440 --> 36:28.440
So we have seen that the reproach to Saussure are splitting apart, and now we come to idealism. What is idealism? It is the separation from between idealism and facts or reality or real life.

36:29.440 --> 36:40.440
What they call real nihilists, which is a calc from the German, the Wirkliche Wirkliche.

36:41.440 --> 37:03.440
So, for all those subjectly with language is not a system of sign. And I do advise you to read this book by Lenin, materialism and imperial criticism, where he explains that bourgeois ideology is based on science, whereas materialist way of thought,

37:03.440 --> 37:26.440
does not accept that language is a system of sign. And if you are interested in semiotics, you must read this book, because it is extremely important. It is the demolishing of all possibility of semiotic.

37:26.440 --> 37:53.440
So Saussure denies substance, therefore he is an idealist, and therefore is important here. You see, because for them, the language is a substance, is an essence. It has a nature, and we must figure out what this nature or essence of substance is.

37:54.440 --> 37:58.440
And of course the structure is not a substance.

37:58.440 --> 38:18.440
This is an idea of matching knowledge to the object to be known. The object is complex, so the description must be complex too. You know that Saussure leaves apart what is not pertinent.

38:18.440 --> 38:29.440
He said that in English, I saw pertinence. So he's interested only in what is pertinent for his own point of view.

38:29.440 --> 38:44.440
A point of view does not mean arbitrariness. A point of view means that you choose only you select the elements which are useful for what you are looking for.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.440
Everything.

38:47.440 --> 39:03.440
So I must say that perhaps you remember that Roman Jacobson, my dear Roman Jacobson said that I am a linguist and nothing which is linguistic is alien to me.

39:03.440 --> 39:13.440
So Saussure is totally different from that. Only opposite. He leaves apart what is not pertinent for his study.

39:13.440 --> 39:23.440
So one of the sentences of Saussure is precisely that the point of view is the object.

39:23.440 --> 39:29.440
This is absolutely fantastically interesting.

39:29.440 --> 39:37.440
You must have a point of view because it is impossible to know everything at the same time.

39:37.440 --> 39:43.440
It is impossible to have an overview of the reality.

39:43.440 --> 40:06.440
Perhaps as you are semioticians, you probably know that the Argentine writer Borges wrote a very small novel, which is called Rigor de la Ciencia, where he explained that an emperor asked his geographers to draw

40:06.440 --> 40:11.440
a very precise map of the surroundings of the palace.

40:11.440 --> 40:30.440
So they took a very thin pencil and they draw every stone of every path, every tree of every forest, but the emperor was not satisfied.

40:30.440 --> 40:34.440
He wanted the totally precise map.

40:34.440 --> 40:38.440
So what did the geographers do?

40:38.440 --> 40:51.440
They decided to draw a map on the scale one to one, which means that one centimeter on the ground is one centimeter on the map.

40:51.440 --> 40:59.440
So the problem is that where is this map? It is here. This is precisely the one to one map.

40:59.440 --> 41:09.440
It does exist. So it is not useful. It is totally useless to draw a one to one map because it already exists.

41:09.440 --> 41:18.440
So a map cannot say everything. It is impossible to reproduce reality.

41:18.440 --> 41:25.440
A map is less like language. You have to choose what you are going to speak about.

41:25.440 --> 41:35.440
But of course, if you imagine that the point of view is arbitrariness, then of course Tossier is an idealist.

41:35.440 --> 41:41.440
So an enemy. So a bourgeois.

41:41.440 --> 41:49.440
This sentence only makes sense if it deals with the object of knowledge and not the real object.

41:49.440 --> 41:55.440
This is the main core of epistemology.

41:55.440 --> 42:16.440
The real object exists without us. The sounds in phonetics do not need the phoneticians to exist, but the phonemes in phonomics in phonology cannot exist without the phonologists.

42:16.440 --> 42:24.440
For instance, for one and the same language, you can have different phonemic systems.

42:24.440 --> 42:31.440
There was a phonemic school in Leningrad and another one in Moscow.

42:31.440 --> 42:36.440
There are totally different ways of explaining the same Russian language.

42:36.440 --> 42:44.440
So you see this is important. A phoneme is not a thing. A phoneme does not exist.

42:44.440 --> 42:52.440
The sounds are like mushrooms in the forest. The mushrooms exist even if you don't pick them up.

42:52.440 --> 43:11.440
But phonemes exist only in our head. And this is what was not understandable if you think that science, the goal of science is to describe reality.

43:11.440 --> 43:20.440
So we have this failure of knowledge, the overlap of the object of knowledge by the empirical object.

43:20.440 --> 43:35.440
This means that there are people who do not understand the huge difference between a sound and a phoneme between phonetics and phonology.

43:35.440 --> 43:49.440
So to conclude, I will say that you are in front of the opposition between epistemology and ontology.

43:49.440 --> 43:55.440
Ontology is the science of being, of the real being.

43:55.440 --> 44:02.440
Ontology is the core of metaphysics and theology.

44:02.440 --> 44:07.440
Epistemology is the science of knowledge.

44:07.440 --> 44:16.440
The science of knowledge is not just opening your eyes and see or opening your ears and listen to sounds.

44:16.440 --> 44:24.440
Epistemology is the way of building a knowledge of reality.

44:24.440 --> 44:29.440
We can speak of immanuel Kant, but we don't have time to do that.

44:29.440 --> 44:42.440
So I think I'll begin here. Thank you for your attention.

44:42.440 --> 44:48.440
Thank you. Thank you very much for a wonderful, really wonderful talk.

44:48.440 --> 44:56.440
Do we have questions from the audience or also from our friends in Zoom?

44:56.440 --> 45:00.440
I will stop.

45:00.440 --> 45:07.440
So I see we have two messages, but okay.

45:07.440 --> 45:09.440
Tufi, ahead.

45:09.440 --> 45:14.440
Yes, yes, please.

45:15.440 --> 45:18.440
Yes.

45:18.440 --> 45:20.440
Can you hear me?

45:20.440 --> 45:22.440
Yes.

45:22.440 --> 45:33.440
I have a question on Borges. It was really rather nice that you quoted Borges because Prieto did so in 1970, something when he produced Berdé dans ses pratiques.

45:33.440 --> 45:37.440
So I think that great minds come together on this object.

45:37.440 --> 45:46.440
I have a question on remark rather on translation of lang, langage, and parole.

45:46.440 --> 45:57.440
I found exactly the same sort of problem when examining the reviews of the CLG, the course of in general linguistics, in English.

45:57.440 --> 46:06.440
And some people call speech, parole, but some people call speech, langage, which means that it makes things very difficult.

46:06.440 --> 46:14.440
Have you come across the same sort of thing in this sort of field?

46:14.440 --> 46:16.440
Have you heard me?

46:16.440 --> 46:24.440
I'm sorry, I have a problem with my ears, but I did not understand what you said.

46:24.440 --> 46:30.440
There is a problem between translating from French to English.

46:30.440 --> 46:36.440
Yes, yes, yes, you are right. This is precisely, I do understand what you speak about.

46:36.440 --> 46:48.440
But it is true that the problem is that lang and langage are two extremely different notions, which thanks to Saussure, we began to understand them.

46:48.440 --> 47:00.440
And it is true that in English language and in German Sprache, and in Russian music, give the possibility of a great confusion.

47:00.440 --> 47:11.440
But there are always possibilities to invent a new terminology. So it should not be a problem.

47:11.440 --> 47:35.440
Nonetheless, in Russian, the word язык, and at times речь, and at times слово, is neither long nor language, but a strange mixture of both long and langage.

47:35.440 --> 47:44.440
And it is a third notion, which is neither long nor longage. Yes, you are right. This is a problem.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.440
Okay, thank you.

47:46.440 --> 47:49.440
You're welcome.

47:49.440 --> 47:55.440
Thank you. And we have questions from the audience here.

47:55.440 --> 48:06.440
Please.

48:06.440 --> 48:15.440
Okay, thank you very much for your talk.

48:15.440 --> 48:24.440
So I appreciated your explanation of the difference between the synchrony and the static state.

48:24.440 --> 48:41.440
And I was just wondering, because the example that you showed us with the crosscut is actually a picture of a plant cut across, but then you said that we cannot do like synchrony research about living beings.

48:41.440 --> 48:49.440
And if we understand language as a living organism, we cannot do the real synchrony.

48:49.440 --> 49:01.440
I'm not sure if I understood correctly, but my question was, if really this is so because actually, even sister, he used example of a plant which is a living organism.

49:01.440 --> 49:10.440
Well, you have the right, of course, to consider that language is a living organism.

49:10.440 --> 49:19.440
I think that a language is not a living organism. And then what can we do?

49:19.440 --> 49:34.440
The talk is finished. You see, no, it's not the problem that language is or not an organism. It is the problem that what is the object of knowledge that we build.

49:34.440 --> 49:46.440
Of course, languages do not need linguists to exist. They just exist by themselves. There's no problem. We are totally useless for languages.

49:46.440 --> 50:07.440
But if we want to learn something to see to understand something about how languages work. So I think that the analogy between languages and organism is bad analogy.

50:07.440 --> 50:17.440
It does not, it's not useful to build a theory of linguistics.

50:17.440 --> 50:31.440
Nonetheless, if you want languages to be a living organism, please do. And now we'll have to compare what are your results and what are minds.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.440
That's all. Please do.

50:34.440 --> 50:37.440
No, I don't necessarily want to.

50:37.440 --> 50:47.440
This is like a foreign language as a living organism. But I was just wondering, if we admit that language could be understood as living organism, we can still do some chronic research.

50:47.440 --> 50:56.440
Like, yeah, I don't see a necessarily contradiction there. That was only my point. But I understand what you're saying.

50:56.440 --> 51:15.440
You see, if we decide to study languages as organism, then we cannot make a difference between synchrony and a short dichrony.

51:15.440 --> 51:34.440
It loses this possibility. So we have to abandon so sure. And we will be quite nearer, let's say Humboldt or Fossler or people like that. Why not.

51:34.440 --> 51:40.440
They have a certain charm I like romanticism. Why not. But it's not the same.

51:40.440 --> 52:07.440
And from an epistemological point of view, I think that the idea that the point of view creates the object is more is more useful that you can understand more than if you of course you have the right but if that then if you

52:07.440 --> 52:11.440
have the language is an organism.

52:11.440 --> 52:18.440
And I must say that this is an old 19th century idea.

52:18.440 --> 52:25.440
Sorry.

52:25.440 --> 52:34.440
This is the name.

52:34.440 --> 52:44.440
But do we have more questions from the audience, or from people in zoom. I see some people there in some who could say a big deal about the relationships between

52:45.440 --> 52:51.440
linguistics and biology and organic system, but not.

52:51.440 --> 52:54.440
Maybe I have a small question.

52:54.440 --> 53:10.440
Could you elaborate a little bit on this distinction between history and dichrony, because also in the course in so sure there is some talk about history as something that depends on human actions.

53:10.440 --> 53:22.440
Because I think this, this idea of history was also used by, by Prieto, for instance, and by other linguists. But yeah, how do you see this difference between history and dichrony.

53:22.440 --> 53:32.440
And how would it relate to to arbitrariness to arbitrariness if it relates.

53:32.440 --> 53:45.440
So many people have spoken about arbitrariness that I shouldn't dare begin this discussion.

53:45.440 --> 54:07.440
But arbitrariness has been understood as a sort of fantasy, as a sort of subjectiveness, but arbitrariness is just the idea that there is no motivated relationship between the signifier and the signifier.

54:07.440 --> 54:34.440
That's all. Unfortunately, our hero, so sure, makes a mistake when he explains that ox and buff are different signified, they are not signified, they are objects of reality, and this has been the source of many, many misunderstandings.

54:34.440 --> 54:55.440
Now, history and dichrony. Dichrony is a point of view, whereas history exists without us. Dichrony is belongs inside a specific science.

54:55.440 --> 55:11.440
Dichrony does not exist. Asynchrony does not exist either. They are points of view. But history does exist. This is absolutely, this is real life.

55:11.440 --> 55:26.440
In the, the object of discussion is between epistemology and ontology. So, let's forget history. History was the main objective of the neo grammarians.

55:26.440 --> 55:48.440
They were inside the history. And the whole 19th century was fascinated by history. And it was all from Heber, Fischer, Schlagen, Schleicher, all even Antoine Meier, all were fascinated by history.

55:48.440 --> 56:07.440
And they thought that real science must, cannot, not be historical. Now, what was revolutionary in Saussure was not at all that he dealt with static situation, not at all.

56:07.440 --> 56:21.440
Synchrony is not static. Synchrony is a point of view when you select, especially what you want to speak about, and nothing else.

56:22.440 --> 56:27.440
We have a raised hand from Professor Joseph. Please.

56:27.440 --> 56:39.440
Hello, Patrick. Thank you very much. It was, it was a great paper and I was particularly happy. I suppose relieved. I don't know. I was, I was anyway intrigued to hear you refer to.

56:39.440 --> 56:56.440
You said my dear Roman Jacobson, and I've never been sure, especially since reading your book structure in the whole, which I made. I was very lucky to be able to refer to in my talk to, to this group at the start of the semester.

56:56.440 --> 57:14.440
But you are ambivalent about your dear Roman Jacobson, aren't you? I mean, I'm ambivalent about my dear wife and children. So it would be a normal thing to expect, but I just like to hear you say a little bit about your view of Roman Jacobson.

57:15.440 --> 57:17.440
Yes, I didn't hear.

57:17.440 --> 57:32.440
He said he was impressed about you even referred to Roman Jacobson as your dear Roman, Roman Jacobson. So he would like you to expand on why is it dear for you, Roman Jacobson.

57:32.440 --> 57:46.440
It's like, you know, Roman Jacobson, because Roman Jacobson was perhaps the only linguist with a sense of humor. Once a journalist asked him, Mr. Jacobson, how many wives did you have?

57:46.440 --> 58:14.440
And he said, do you mean in dichrony or in synchrony? So that's why I like Roman Jacobson. Now, he had a whole fantasy. And, of course, I know that he was a slavophile, that he did not understand, so sure, that he was

58:14.440 --> 58:28.440
he invented a Russian culture which did not exist. But nonetheless, we are all thankful to Jacobson for his fantasy, for bringing fantasy into linguistics.

58:30.440 --> 58:33.440
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And

58:38.440 --> 58:40.440
Professor Kallavi, hello.

58:40.440 --> 58:42.440
Hello.

58:42.440 --> 58:46.440
Do you have something to add? Because we were wondering.

58:46.440 --> 59:12.440
So that's so nice and so good to see all you have there. Again, arbitrariness, you said, you don't want to tell about that, but you may know that Israel has formulated the definition of semiotics as

59:13.440 --> 59:23.440
studying everything, what is arbitrary, more or less like this, yeah? Israel, you can confirm.

59:24.440 --> 59:50.440
All aspects of arbitrariness, that is the object for semiotics. But here, the same thing, how arbitrariness and motivativeness are related. I still think that when Saussure first says that principle number one is that language is arbitrary.

59:50.440 --> 01:00:19.440
And further on, he just somehow becomes not so clear anymore when he is starting to speak about motivativeness. Motivatedness should be understood as just some kind of restrictions or constraints to arbitrariness.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:45.440
But not really opposite to it. I think that is very, very important difference now, whether arbitrariness and motivativeness are opposites or this motivativeness is simply restriction for arbitrariness.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:58.440
So, yeah, if you comment on that would be nice. Otherwise, we just will have this discussion later.

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:11.440
So he was talking about the distinction between motivativeness and arbitrariness and saying motivativeness as a sort of restriction of arbitrariness and whether you could comment on that.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:23.440
Calibri, I don't agree with you. I think that arbitrariness and motivation are extremely different.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:50.440
Motivation, it means that you have an intrinsic link between a signifier and signified, and motivation does exist in some parts. For instance, I don't know to paint painting, it's obvious that those three words have a relationship of motivation.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:02:11.440
Because painting has absolutely no motivation with the act of painting. So arbitrariness means the total absence of possible link. So, no, I don't think that motivation is a part of arbitrariness, not at all.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.440
Yes, nice to see you.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.440
Thank you so much. Thank you. Thanks to all of you.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:35.440
And now I think, yes, we can.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:39.440
So now we will stop recording.
