0	6040	Calculus is hard because it is different. It introduces completely new concepts such
6040	11680	as the limit, the derivative, and the integral. These are novel concepts that appear completely
11680	17920	unintuitive and hard to grasp. When students don't understand the concepts, their applications
17920	24840	are next to impossible. So, to understand calculus, we first must reinforce the concepts
24840	32400	that are fundamental to its foundation. I believe the key to understanding calculus lies
32400	37800	in teaching these concepts. The algebra and complicated math that trips students up can
37800	43120	be learned in time, but a student who never grasps the fundamental ideas of calculus can
43120	49400	never succeed. So, let's take a step back from everything we know about math and try
49400	57320	to learn calculus in a whole new way.
57320	62760	So infinity is really cool because it allows us to talk about things that are either really
62760	69560	big or really small. Infinity has this reputation of being known as the biggest number. Have
69560	76200	you guys heard of that before? Yes. It's not. It's not. Yes, you're correct. If I asked
76200	83440	you guys to count the numbers between 1 and 2, 1.1 is slightly bigger than 1, right? And
83440	89000	it definitely is between 1 and 2. Do you all agree? Yes. So, right now, we have one number
89000	97040	between 1 and 2. 1.11 is also between 1 and 2, right? It's a little bit bigger than 1.1,
97040	104280	right? Yeah. So, now we have two numbers that are definitely between 1 and 2. 1.111. This
104280	110200	is also between 1 and 2. So, if we keep adding 1s, that's what this dot, dot, dot, dot means
110200	113680	over there, that means we can just keep adding 1 on to the end of the summer forever. And
113680	119080	every single time we add 1 on, the number gets a little bit bigger, right? So, it's a
119080	124160	unique number. It's a different number that's between 1 and 2 every single time we do this.
124160	128840	And if we keep counting these numbers as in how many numbers are between 1 and 2, we'll
128840	140280	never end. That is infinity. Infinity is a concept. And this is crucial to understanding
140280	147080	not just infinity but also for calculus. So, now with that, let's talk about 1 over infinity.
147080	153360	If I have 1 over 2, we have this one pizza. We cut it in half. And this red right here
153360	159600	is the amount of my one slice. We all agree? Yes. So, now let's go to 1 over 3. We have
159600	165000	this one pizza and we divide it into three equal slices. This red slice is the amount
165000	170960	of one slice. And now if we divide it into four, what do we notice? It gets even smaller,
170960	179000	right? So, we have 1 over 5. It's a little bit smaller, okay? 1 over 6. 1 over 15. Let's
179040	187400	look at 1 over 80. What would happen if we go to 1 over infinity? The question is, is
187400	197240	it equal to zero? So, remember that infinity is not a number. So, 1 over infinity doesn't
197240	201600	represent anything. Remember, we had to have a number on the bottom of this thing, right?
201600	206880	We have to divide it into a certain number of slices. And if we divide it by infinity
206880	212720	to me, that means nothing. But what does that mean about our pizza slice? Well, we said
212720	223360	it's not equal to zero. But what we can say is that 1 over infinity goes to zero. When
223360	229040	we increase that number on the bottom, our slice gets smaller and smaller and smaller.
229040	234840	And if we keep doing that forever and we keep adding 1 to that bottom number, our slice
234840	240720	is getting closer and closer and closer to being nothing, but it's never equal to nothing.
240720	251760	What this is called, and this is important, this is infinitely small. 1 over infinity
251760	258040	is an infinitely small number, just like infinity is an infinitely large number. Let's move
258040	262880	on to something that I know you're familiar with, area. I want to talk to you guys about
262880	268880	an interesting way to take area. So, let's say we're trying to calculate the area of
268880	274000	a triangle. A way that we might be able to do it is by taking something whose area that
274000	278920	we do know and filling our triangle with it. So, let's say we have our quarters stacked
278920	286000	up like this. And we want to say, what is the area of a triangle that has this shape?
286000	294240	Well, let's count the quarters and say how many quarters fit into this triangle. So,
294240	298400	one way we can do this, we can count it just by going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we can do that. But
298400	303440	the way I want to talk about doing it is to count all the columns. If we count all the
303440	308280	quarters, we add 1, plus 2, plus 3, we get 21 quarters are shown right here. And we can
308280	316000	say that our quarters roughly fill this shape, okay? And that there's about 21 quarters in
316000	321360	this triangle. But if we fill this triangle, the first thing I want to show you guys is
321360	325760	that there's a little space in here, right? Where the quarters don't quite touch. And
325760	330800	if we fill the triangle in, we see that there's a lot of this overhang on the quarter. So,
330800	335920	how can we make this a more accurate measurement? Well, let's use nickels now. Now, we have
335960	341840	a lot more columns, right? And what we can do is we can add up these columns again and
341840	346880	say, okay, well, there's 36 nickels here. And now if I ask you, how big is this triangle,
346880	353600	what would you say? About 36. And again, we did this by counting up all the columns. And
353600	356880	now if we look at the inside of the triangle, the space in between the quarters are a little
356880	361680	bit less. There's not as big of a gap between the quarters, between the coins, making it
361760	366160	slightly more accurate. And if we draw it, we say that there's a little less overhang,
366160	373160	right? So, let's go even smaller. Let's use a dime. And if we count up all the columns
373160	378360	the same way that we did before, and there's a lot more columns, so it's a little bit harder,
378360	385120	we get 136 dimes. If we put this triangle over, we notice two things. One, the space
385120	389360	is really small now compared to the quarters. It's still definitely there, but it's definitely
389360	394720	smaller space. And if we fill this triangle up, it almost looks perfect. We know that
394720	397840	there's a little bit of space inside that we have to deal with, but as far as overhang
397840	403600	is concerned, it's pretty much gone, okay? It's still there, right? But there's a lot less.
404320	409200	So now let's compare the three triangles we just talked about. The dimes is definitely
409200	418320	the most accurate out of these three. We all agree? So, we look at the columns that we used.
418320	424080	The width of these columns is only as small as the width of this quarter or the coin. And so,
424640	429920	if we say this nickel has half the width of this quarter and that this dime has a quarter,
429920	436320	one-fourth of the width of this coin, we're taking our column and we're making it smaller and smaller
436320	442800	and smaller. If we keep going on forever and ever and ever and making our coin smaller and
442800	449200	smaller and smaller, making the width of this column smaller and smaller, by using smaller
449200	454400	coins, the accuracy is going to keep getting better and better. And if we make it infinity,
455200	461680	our accuracy should be 100% eventually. So, what would that look like? Well, let's take a look.
462320	468880	This is a decent picture of what that might look like. Now, obviously, one over infinity is so small
468880	474240	that we can't really represent it. We can't make an infinitely small column on a computer or even
474240	479440	draw it because we can always make it smaller. We can always add it onto that infinity, but it
479440	486880	might look something like this. And if we zoom in to this corner over here, we have these columns
486880	494880	that go up. And imagine that these are the width of our infinitely small coins. If we add up all
494880	500640	these columns, we would get the area of our triangle and it would be 100% accurate. This is
500640	506880	one of the big concepts that I want to drive home is that one over infinity can be used
508800	518720	to calculate area, to find the area. And this, this is huge because this is one of the principles
518800	526240	of calculus. This is the second most arguably, first most important idea of calculus,
526240	533920	is that if we use infinitely small columns, we can find the area of anything. Okay. I want to
533920	538960	talk about another concept that's really important to calculus, and that has to do with slope. Let's
538960	546480	start by defining what slope is. So, when I think about slope, what I think of is the incline of a
546480	553280	ramp that you're riding from left to right. So, for example, if we have this guy over here,
553280	558560	he's on a skateboard, he's going up this incline, he's going left to right. We say that this is a
558560	563680	positive slope because he's going up. Now, this guy, same skateboarder, maybe he got to the top of
563680	569040	the hill and he goes, oh, I got to go down now. Now he's going down this from left to right. So,
569040	575040	our slope is negative. It's downhill. We understand the difference between those two? Okay. So,
575040	580640	with this, let's move on to talking about apples. Let's say I have 10 apples,
582000	589120	and I eat, I eat five of them in one minute because I'm like a speed apple eater. And now I have two
589120	595440	data points. I have two numbers, two groups of numbers. We can put this on a graph. This line
595440	600880	tells us that if we go to any point on this, on this graph, we can read how many apples we have
600960	605360	at this minute. So, we have this, this line, and what does this look like?
607280	613200	Looks like a slope, right? And we can put our skateboarder on it. So, this guy is going downhill,
613200	619040	so it's a positive or negative? Negative. But what is the value of this slope?
620560	628400	How can we calculate it? And more importantly, what makes this slope right here, so this line,
628400	635040	different from this slope or this slope? What exactly is the numerical difference? What's the
635040	639680	difference in the actual slope between these two? Between these three? What we can do is say that
639680	645760	the slope is equal to the number of apples that I ate over the time that I ate them. If we have this
645760	651200	line, we start at 10, go to five. How many apples did we eat? Five. Five. And how long did it take?
651200	657520	One minute. One minute. So, our slope is going to be negative five. But what if we had a line that
657520	663360	looks a little more complicated? This isn't a straight line. We have a line that looks something
663920	672640	like this. It's not straight. It's not easy to calculate that slope. And the reason is,
672640	678480	is because the slope changes. Let's look at a skateboarder here. He's probably going to go
678480	684480	really fast. Like, that's a pretty drastic drop, right? It's a really negative slope. Do you agree?
685040	694480	And let's say that slope is right here, okay? Pretty negative. And if we put the same skateboarder
694480	700320	over here, he's like riding a flat ground. He's not really going anywhere, right? He's coasting.
700880	707680	So, that slope is maybe somewhere over here. But what's important is that this same graph,
707680	713360	this same line, has many different slopes. Because this is different than this, which is
713360	718880	different than this. And every single point is slightly different slope. So, we want to be able
718880	724640	to say, well, what is the slope at any given time, right? How fast is our skateboarder going
724640	731200	if we follow this line at any given number? So, if we look at this graph, and we sort of have it,
731200	736160	okay? We take it and we cut it in half. So, if you look on the bottom here, it goes from one to ten.
737200	742480	And it looks like a pretty curvy line. Now, let's say that that's one over one. And let's take a
742480	747600	half of that. So, now we go from zero to five. Look at the numbers on the bottom. We go from zero
747600	753760	to five in our time, okay? So, if we go again, now we go from one to two point five. Now it looks
753760	760480	like an even more straight line. And if we go again, one to one point two five, that almost looks
760480	764960	like an exactly straight line. It's slightly different. It's slightly not straight. It has a
764960	770400	slight curve to it. But it's definitely a lot better. And remember, all we did is we went from
771040	775120	ten to five to two point five to one point two five. We kept having that number,
775120	781200	okay? And it looked more and more straight. So, the question is, what are we doing here?
781200	786480	What I would say is that we started at one over one. Let's say we start at one over one and we
786480	792320	have it. We get the one over two. So, now we're at half of our initial graph centered about one,
792320	798000	because one's always there, right? And we have that. Now we're at one over four, following me.
798640	804640	We keep having the length of our graph centered about one. And we're getting this number on the
804640	813040	right is getting closer and closer and closer to one, right? So, what would happen if we go a
813040	818560	distance of one over infinity? It would be a straight line. Remember, infinity is not a number.
818560	825840	Infinity is a concept. And one over infinity is infinitely small. So, we go from one to one
825840	833200	plus one over infinity. And what we see is we recover a straight line. Doesn't that blow your
833200	841840	mind? Remember, we started out at this. And we said, you can't measure that slope, because it's
841840	846400	different everywhere. It's different every single point on this graph has a different slope.
847600	854080	But if we have it more and more and we focus in on one, we focus in right here. We're focusing
854080	861200	on this time. And we look at only that instant of time. It looks like a line. We said before
861200	866000	that every single point has a slope. And we also said that in order to measure that slope,
866000	872960	we need a straight line. So, if we look at an instant in time that is essentially just one point,
873760	878800	we better get a line, because we need a line to measure the slope there. Do you agree?
878880	886320	Yeah. So, this makes complete sense. If we look at a time from one to something just after one,
886320	890800	infinitely close to one, it better look like a line, because we want to be able to measure
890800	896080	that slope, because we know it exists. And that's important, is that we know this slope has to exist.
896080	902160	So, there must be a line there. And the question is, how we have to just be able to look only at
902160	909360	that point in time to find that line? And this is very important, because we can measure the slope
909360	915040	of this line. Based on this picture, we know that it exists and we know that it's calculable. We
915040	920960	know that we can find it if we have the right tools. I want you to leave with this idea that
920960	937520	one over infinity can be used to find the slope of a curved line. And this is also crucial. This is,
937520	943280	remember I said the area was like the central, one of the two central ideas of calculus? This is
943280	949520	the other one. This is the second half of the complete picture of calculus, is that we can use
949600	956880	calculus to not just find the area of the shape, but to find the slope of a function, of a line,
956880	964720	of a graph, that otherwise we wouldn't be able to find the slope of. All right, so let's just recap
964720	970400	what we learned today. We learned, most importantly, that infinity is not a number. Infinity is a
970400	979040	concept. We also learned that one over infinity is not equal to zero. It leads to zero. It goes to
979040	984080	zero. If we look at one over infinity, it gets smaller and smaller and smaller because infinitely
984080	991440	small and goes to zero. And one over infinity allows us to find the area of shapes using really
991440	997120	small, infinitely small columns, which is crazy. If I give you a weird object, like maybe I give
997120	1002640	you something that looks like this, how do you find the area of that thing? That's pretty hard,
1003200	1008640	right? You want to have a formula for that. We want to be able to use the columns. We also showed
1009120	1014240	that one over infinity allows us to turn a curvy line, a curvy line like this,
1015040	1021760	into a straight line at a specific point, at a specific time, which is amazing because it allows
1021760	1026160	us to find the slope at any given time of a line that we normally wouldn't be able to.
1030720	1036080	Students just beginning to study calculus always find the concepts of limits, derivatives, and
1036160	1042720	intervals hard to understand. But when these concepts are broken down and explained in new,
1042720	1048720	unique ways, such as by using coins to visualize intervals, they become infinitely easier to
1048720	1055120	understand. In fact, the rather unconventional methods for teaching calculus using this video
1055120	1061040	allowed the same students who usually hate things that were problems to follow these daunting concepts.
1061120	1066000	You're actually like really, really good at explaining everything. You gave a lot of detail
1066000	1072080	expand. I think that was like really, it made sense. Like I can understand it, made it easy
1072080	1078240	to understand what you were trying to say. So next time you hit a roadblock and want to give up
1078240	1084000	because you just can't grasp a concept right away, take a step back and try to tackle the concept
1084000	1089360	in a new way, just like we did with using pizza to explain infinity and skateboarders to explain
1089360	1095920	slope. Then, once you dive into the awesome fields of mathematics, you will, just like the
1095920	1105200	fifth years in this video, have a thirst for knowledge. And one day, just like those students,
1105200	1119200	go on to change the world.
