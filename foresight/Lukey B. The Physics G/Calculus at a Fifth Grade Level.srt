1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,040
Calculus is hard because it is different. It introduces completely new concepts such

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,680
as the limit, the derivative, and the integral. These are novel concepts that appear completely

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:17,920
unintuitive and hard to grasp. When students don't understand the concepts, their applications

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,840
are next to impossible. So, to understand calculus, we first must reinforce the concepts

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:32,400
that are fundamental to its foundation. I believe the key to understanding calculus lies

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:37,800
in teaching these concepts. The algebra and complicated math that trips students up can

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,120
be learned in time, but a student who never grasps the fundamental ideas of calculus can

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:49,400
never succeed. So, let's take a step back from everything we know about math and try

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:57,320
to learn calculus in a whole new way.

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,760
So infinity is really cool because it allows us to talk about things that are either really

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,560
big or really small. Infinity has this reputation of being known as the biggest number. Have

12
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:16,200
you guys heard of that before? Yes. It's not. It's not. Yes, you're correct. If I asked

13
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,440
you guys to count the numbers between 1 and 2, 1.1 is slightly bigger than 1, right? And

14
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:29,000
it definitely is between 1 and 2. Do you all agree? Yes. So, right now, we have one number

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,040
between 1 and 2. 1.11 is also between 1 and 2, right? It's a little bit bigger than 1.1,

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,280
right? Yeah. So, now we have two numbers that are definitely between 1 and 2. 1.111. This

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,200
is also between 1 and 2. So, if we keep adding 1s, that's what this dot, dot, dot, dot means

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,680
over there, that means we can just keep adding 1 on to the end of the summer forever. And

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,080
every single time we add 1 on, the number gets a little bit bigger, right? So, it's a

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,160
unique number. It's a different number that's between 1 and 2 every single time we do this.

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,840
And if we keep counting these numbers as in how many numbers are between 1 and 2, we'll

22
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:20,280
never end. That is infinity. Infinity is a concept. And this is crucial to understanding

23
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,080
not just infinity but also for calculus. So, now with that, let's talk about 1 over infinity.

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,360
If I have 1 over 2, we have this one pizza. We cut it in half. And this red right here

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:39,600
is the amount of my one slice. We all agree? Yes. So, now let's go to 1 over 3. We have

26
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,000
this one pizza and we divide it into three equal slices. This red slice is the amount

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,960
of one slice. And now if we divide it into four, what do we notice? It gets even smaller,

28
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:59,000
right? So, we have 1 over 5. It's a little bit smaller, okay? 1 over 6. 1 over 15. Let's

29
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:07,400
look at 1 over 80. What would happen if we go to 1 over infinity? The question is, is

30
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:17,240
it equal to zero? So, remember that infinity is not a number. So, 1 over infinity doesn't

31
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,600
represent anything. Remember, we had to have a number on the bottom of this thing, right?

32
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,880
We have to divide it into a certain number of slices. And if we divide it by infinity

33
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,720
to me, that means nothing. But what does that mean about our pizza slice? Well, we said

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:43,360
it's not equal to zero. But what we can say is that 1 over infinity goes to zero. When

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,040
we increase that number on the bottom, our slice gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,840
And if we keep doing that forever and we keep adding 1 to that bottom number, our slice

37
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,720
is getting closer and closer and closer to being nothing, but it's never equal to nothing.

38
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:11,760
What this is called, and this is important, this is infinitely small. 1 over infinity

39
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,040
is an infinitely small number, just like infinity is an infinitely large number. Let's move

40
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,880
on to something that I know you're familiar with, area. I want to talk to you guys about

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,880
an interesting way to take area. So, let's say we're trying to calculate the area of

42
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,000
a triangle. A way that we might be able to do it is by taking something whose area that

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,920
we do know and filling our triangle with it. So, let's say we have our quarters stacked

44
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:46,000
up like this. And we want to say, what is the area of a triangle that has this shape?

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,240
Well, let's count the quarters and say how many quarters fit into this triangle. So,

46
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
one way we can do this, we can count it just by going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we can do that. But

47
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,440
the way I want to talk about doing it is to count all the columns. If we count all the

48
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,280
quarters, we add 1, plus 2, plus 3, we get 21 quarters are shown right here. And we can

49
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,000
say that our quarters roughly fill this shape, okay? And that there's about 21 quarters in

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,360
this triangle. But if we fill this triangle, the first thing I want to show you guys is

51
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,760
that there's a little space in here, right? Where the quarters don't quite touch. And

52
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,800
if we fill the triangle in, we see that there's a lot of this overhang on the quarter. So,

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,920
how can we make this a more accurate measurement? Well, let's use nickels now. Now, we have

54
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,840
a lot more columns, right? And what we can do is we can add up these columns again and

55
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,880
say, okay, well, there's 36 nickels here. And now if I ask you, how big is this triangle,

56
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,600
what would you say? About 36. And again, we did this by counting up all the columns. And

57
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
now if we look at the inside of the triangle, the space in between the quarters are a little

58
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,680
bit less. There's not as big of a gap between the quarters, between the coins, making it

59
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,160
slightly more accurate. And if we draw it, we say that there's a little less overhang,

60
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,160
right? So, let's go even smaller. Let's use a dime. And if we count up all the columns

61
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,360
the same way that we did before, and there's a lot more columns, so it's a little bit harder,

62
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:25,120
we get 136 dimes. If we put this triangle over, we notice two things. One, the space

63
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,360
is really small now compared to the quarters. It's still definitely there, but it's definitely

64
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,720
smaller space. And if we fill this triangle up, it almost looks perfect. We know that

65
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,840
there's a little bit of space inside that we have to deal with, but as far as overhang

66
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,600
is concerned, it's pretty much gone, okay? It's still there, right? But there's a lot less.

67
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:49,200
So now let's compare the three triangles we just talked about. The dimes is definitely

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:58,320
the most accurate out of these three. We all agree? So, we look at the columns that we used.

69
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,080
The width of these columns is only as small as the width of this quarter or the coin. And so,

70
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,920
if we say this nickel has half the width of this quarter and that this dime has a quarter,

71
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:16,320
one-fourth of the width of this coin, we're taking our column and we're making it smaller and smaller

72
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:22,800
and smaller. If we keep going on forever and ever and ever and making our coin smaller and

73
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,200
smaller and smaller, making the width of this column smaller and smaller, by using smaller

74
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,400
coins, the accuracy is going to keep getting better and better. And if we make it infinity,

75
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,680
our accuracy should be 100% eventually. So, what would that look like? Well, let's take a look.

76
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,880
This is a decent picture of what that might look like. Now, obviously, one over infinity is so small

77
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,240
that we can't really represent it. We can't make an infinitely small column on a computer or even

78
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,440
draw it because we can always make it smaller. We can always add it onto that infinity, but it

79
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,880
might look something like this. And if we zoom in to this corner over here, we have these columns

80
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:14,880
that go up. And imagine that these are the width of our infinitely small coins. If we add up all

81
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,640
these columns, we would get the area of our triangle and it would be 100% accurate. This is

82
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:26,880
one of the big concepts that I want to drive home is that one over infinity can be used

83
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:38,720
to calculate area, to find the area. And this, this is huge because this is one of the principles

84
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,240
of calculus. This is the second most arguably, first most important idea of calculus,

85
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:53,920
is that if we use infinitely small columns, we can find the area of anything. Okay. I want to

86
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,960
talk about another concept that's really important to calculus, and that has to do with slope. Let's

87
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:06,480
start by defining what slope is. So, when I think about slope, what I think of is the incline of a

88
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,280
ramp that you're riding from left to right. So, for example, if we have this guy over here,

89
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:18,560
he's on a skateboard, he's going up this incline, he's going left to right. We say that this is a

90
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,680
positive slope because he's going up. Now, this guy, same skateboarder, maybe he got to the top of

91
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,040
the hill and he goes, oh, I got to go down now. Now he's going down this from left to right. So,

92
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:35,040
our slope is negative. It's downhill. We understand the difference between those two? Okay. So,

93
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,640
with this, let's move on to talking about apples. Let's say I have 10 apples,

94
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,120
and I eat, I eat five of them in one minute because I'm like a speed apple eater. And now I have two

95
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,440
data points. I have two numbers, two groups of numbers. We can put this on a graph. This line

96
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,880
tells us that if we go to any point on this, on this graph, we can read how many apples we have

97
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,360
at this minute. So, we have this, this line, and what does this look like?

98
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,200
Looks like a slope, right? And we can put our skateboarder on it. So, this guy is going downhill,

99
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,040
so it's a positive or negative? Negative. But what is the value of this slope?

100
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,400
How can we calculate it? And more importantly, what makes this slope right here, so this line,

101
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,040
different from this slope or this slope? What exactly is the numerical difference? What's the

102
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,680
difference in the actual slope between these two? Between these three? What we can do is say that

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,760
the slope is equal to the number of apples that I ate over the time that I ate them. If we have this

104
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,200
line, we start at 10, go to five. How many apples did we eat? Five. Five. And how long did it take?

105
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,520
One minute. One minute. So, our slope is going to be negative five. But what if we had a line that

106
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,360
looks a little more complicated? This isn't a straight line. We have a line that looks something

107
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,640
like this. It's not straight. It's not easy to calculate that slope. And the reason is,

108
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:18,480
is because the slope changes. Let's look at a skateboarder here. He's probably going to go

109
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,480
really fast. Like, that's a pretty drastic drop, right? It's a really negative slope. Do you agree?

110
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:34,480
And let's say that slope is right here, okay? Pretty negative. And if we put the same skateboarder

111
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:40,320
over here, he's like riding a flat ground. He's not really going anywhere, right? He's coasting.

112
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,680
So, that slope is maybe somewhere over here. But what's important is that this same graph,

113
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,360
this same line, has many different slopes. Because this is different than this, which is

114
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,880
different than this. And every single point is slightly different slope. So, we want to be able

115
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,640
to say, well, what is the slope at any given time, right? How fast is our skateboarder going

116
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:11,200
if we follow this line at any given number? So, if we look at this graph, and we sort of have it,

117
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,160
okay? We take it and we cut it in half. So, if you look on the bottom here, it goes from one to ten.

118
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,480
And it looks like a pretty curvy line. Now, let's say that that's one over one. And let's take a

119
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,600
half of that. So, now we go from zero to five. Look at the numbers on the bottom. We go from zero

120
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,760
to five in our time, okay? So, if we go again, now we go from one to two point five. Now it looks

121
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,480
like an even more straight line. And if we go again, one to one point two five, that almost looks

122
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,960
like an exactly straight line. It's slightly different. It's slightly not straight. It has a

123
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,400
slight curve to it. But it's definitely a lot better. And remember, all we did is we went from

124
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,120
ten to five to two point five to one point two five. We kept having that number,

125
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,200
okay? And it looked more and more straight. So, the question is, what are we doing here?

126
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,480
What I would say is that we started at one over one. Let's say we start at one over one and we

127
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,320
have it. We get the one over two. So, now we're at half of our initial graph centered about one,

128
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,000
because one's always there, right? And we have that. Now we're at one over four, following me.

129
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:24,640
We keep having the length of our graph centered about one. And we're getting this number on the

130
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:33,040
right is getting closer and closer and closer to one, right? So, what would happen if we go a

131
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,560
distance of one over infinity? It would be a straight line. Remember, infinity is not a number.

132
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,840
Infinity is a concept. And one over infinity is infinitely small. So, we go from one to one

133
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:53,200
plus one over infinity. And what we see is we recover a straight line. Doesn't that blow your

134
00:13:53,200 --> 00:14:01,840
mind? Remember, we started out at this. And we said, you can't measure that slope, because it's

135
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,400
different everywhere. It's different every single point on this graph has a different slope.

136
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:14,080
But if we have it more and more and we focus in on one, we focus in right here. We're focusing

137
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:21,200
on this time. And we look at only that instant of time. It looks like a line. We said before

138
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,000
that every single point has a slope. And we also said that in order to measure that slope,

139
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,960
we need a straight line. So, if we look at an instant in time that is essentially just one point,

140
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,800
we better get a line, because we need a line to measure the slope there. Do you agree?

141
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:46,320
Yeah. So, this makes complete sense. If we look at a time from one to something just after one,

142
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,800
infinitely close to one, it better look like a line, because we want to be able to measure

143
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,080
that slope, because we know it exists. And that's important, is that we know this slope has to exist.

144
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,160
So, there must be a line there. And the question is, how we have to just be able to look only at

145
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:09,360
that point in time to find that line? And this is very important, because we can measure the slope

146
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,040
of this line. Based on this picture, we know that it exists and we know that it's calculable. We

147
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,960
know that we can find it if we have the right tools. I want you to leave with this idea that

148
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:37,520
one over infinity can be used to find the slope of a curved line. And this is also crucial. This is,

149
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,280
remember I said the area was like the central, one of the two central ideas of calculus? This is

150
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:49,520
the other one. This is the second half of the complete picture of calculus, is that we can use

151
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,880
calculus to not just find the area of the shape, but to find the slope of a function, of a line,

152
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:04,720
of a graph, that otherwise we wouldn't be able to find the slope of. All right, so let's just recap

153
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,400
what we learned today. We learned, most importantly, that infinity is not a number. Infinity is a

154
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:19,040
concept. We also learned that one over infinity is not equal to zero. It leads to zero. It goes to

155
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,080
zero. If we look at one over infinity, it gets smaller and smaller and smaller because infinitely

156
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:31,440
small and goes to zero. And one over infinity allows us to find the area of shapes using really

157
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,120
small, infinitely small columns, which is crazy. If I give you a weird object, like maybe I give

158
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,640
you something that looks like this, how do you find the area of that thing? That's pretty hard,

159
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,640
right? You want to have a formula for that. We want to be able to use the columns. We also showed

160
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,240
that one over infinity allows us to turn a curvy line, a curvy line like this,

161
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:01,760
into a straight line at a specific point, at a specific time, which is amazing because it allows

162
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,160
us to find the slope at any given time of a line that we normally wouldn't be able to.

163
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,080
Students just beginning to study calculus always find the concepts of limits, derivatives, and

164
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,720
intervals hard to understand. But when these concepts are broken down and explained in new,

165
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,720
unique ways, such as by using coins to visualize intervals, they become infinitely easier to

166
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,120
understand. In fact, the rather unconventional methods for teaching calculus using this video

167
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:41,040
allowed the same students who usually hate things that were problems to follow these daunting concepts.

168
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,000
You're actually like really, really good at explaining everything. You gave a lot of detail

169
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,080
expand. I think that was like really, it made sense. Like I can understand it, made it easy

170
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,240
to understand what you were trying to say. So next time you hit a roadblock and want to give up

171
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,000
because you just can't grasp a concept right away, take a step back and try to tackle the concept

172
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,360
in a new way, just like we did with using pizza to explain infinity and skateboarders to explain

173
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,920
slope. Then, once you dive into the awesome fields of mathematics, you will, just like the

174
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:25,200
fifth years in this video, have a thirst for knowledge. And one day, just like those students,

175
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:39,200
go on to change the world.
