00:00.000 --> 00:06.040
Calculus is hard because it is different. It introduces completely new concepts such

00:06.040 --> 00:11.680
as the limit, the derivative, and the integral. These are novel concepts that appear completely

00:11.680 --> 00:17.920
unintuitive and hard to grasp. When students don't understand the concepts, their applications

00:17.920 --> 00:24.840
are next to impossible. So, to understand calculus, we first must reinforce the concepts

00:24.840 --> 00:32.400
that are fundamental to its foundation. I believe the key to understanding calculus lies

00:32.400 --> 00:37.800
in teaching these concepts. The algebra and complicated math that trips students up can

00:37.800 --> 00:43.120
be learned in time, but a student who never grasps the fundamental ideas of calculus can

00:43.120 --> 00:49.400
never succeed. So, let's take a step back from everything we know about math and try

00:49.400 --> 00:57.320
to learn calculus in a whole new way.

00:57.320 --> 01:02.760
So infinity is really cool because it allows us to talk about things that are either really

01:02.760 --> 01:09.560
big or really small. Infinity has this reputation of being known as the biggest number. Have

01:09.560 --> 01:16.200
you guys heard of that before? Yes. It's not. It's not. Yes, you're correct. If I asked

01:16.200 --> 01:23.440
you guys to count the numbers between 1 and 2, 1.1 is slightly bigger than 1, right? And

01:23.440 --> 01:29.000
it definitely is between 1 and 2. Do you all agree? Yes. So, right now, we have one number

01:29.000 --> 01:37.040
between 1 and 2. 1.11 is also between 1 and 2, right? It's a little bit bigger than 1.1,

01:37.040 --> 01:44.280
right? Yeah. So, now we have two numbers that are definitely between 1 and 2. 1.111. This

01:44.280 --> 01:50.200
is also between 1 and 2. So, if we keep adding 1s, that's what this dot, dot, dot, dot means

01:50.200 --> 01:53.680
over there, that means we can just keep adding 1 on to the end of the summer forever. And

01:53.680 --> 01:59.080
every single time we add 1 on, the number gets a little bit bigger, right? So, it's a

01:59.080 --> 02:04.160
unique number. It's a different number that's between 1 and 2 every single time we do this.

02:04.160 --> 02:08.840
And if we keep counting these numbers as in how many numbers are between 1 and 2, we'll

02:08.840 --> 02:20.280
never end. That is infinity. Infinity is a concept. And this is crucial to understanding

02:20.280 --> 02:27.080
not just infinity but also for calculus. So, now with that, let's talk about 1 over infinity.

02:27.080 --> 02:33.360
If I have 1 over 2, we have this one pizza. We cut it in half. And this red right here

02:33.360 --> 02:39.600
is the amount of my one slice. We all agree? Yes. So, now let's go to 1 over 3. We have

02:39.600 --> 02:45.000
this one pizza and we divide it into three equal slices. This red slice is the amount

02:45.000 --> 02:50.960
of one slice. And now if we divide it into four, what do we notice? It gets even smaller,

02:50.960 --> 02:59.000
right? So, we have 1 over 5. It's a little bit smaller, okay? 1 over 6. 1 over 15. Let's

02:59.040 --> 03:07.400
look at 1 over 80. What would happen if we go to 1 over infinity? The question is, is

03:07.400 --> 03:17.240
it equal to zero? So, remember that infinity is not a number. So, 1 over infinity doesn't

03:17.240 --> 03:21.600
represent anything. Remember, we had to have a number on the bottom of this thing, right?

03:21.600 --> 03:26.880
We have to divide it into a certain number of slices. And if we divide it by infinity

03:26.880 --> 03:32.720
to me, that means nothing. But what does that mean about our pizza slice? Well, we said

03:32.720 --> 03:43.360
it's not equal to zero. But what we can say is that 1 over infinity goes to zero. When

03:43.360 --> 03:49.040
we increase that number on the bottom, our slice gets smaller and smaller and smaller.

03:49.040 --> 03:54.840
And if we keep doing that forever and we keep adding 1 to that bottom number, our slice

03:54.840 --> 04:00.720
is getting closer and closer and closer to being nothing, but it's never equal to nothing.

04:00.720 --> 04:11.760
What this is called, and this is important, this is infinitely small. 1 over infinity

04:11.760 --> 04:18.040
is an infinitely small number, just like infinity is an infinitely large number. Let's move

04:18.040 --> 04:22.880
on to something that I know you're familiar with, area. I want to talk to you guys about

04:22.880 --> 04:28.880
an interesting way to take area. So, let's say we're trying to calculate the area of

04:28.880 --> 04:34.000
a triangle. A way that we might be able to do it is by taking something whose area that

04:34.000 --> 04:38.920
we do know and filling our triangle with it. So, let's say we have our quarters stacked

04:38.920 --> 04:46.000
up like this. And we want to say, what is the area of a triangle that has this shape?

04:46.000 --> 04:54.240
Well, let's count the quarters and say how many quarters fit into this triangle. So,

04:54.240 --> 04:58.400
one way we can do this, we can count it just by going 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we can do that. But

04:58.400 --> 05:03.440
the way I want to talk about doing it is to count all the columns. If we count all the

05:03.440 --> 05:08.280
quarters, we add 1, plus 2, plus 3, we get 21 quarters are shown right here. And we can

05:08.280 --> 05:16.000
say that our quarters roughly fill this shape, okay? And that there's about 21 quarters in

05:16.000 --> 05:21.360
this triangle. But if we fill this triangle, the first thing I want to show you guys is

05:21.360 --> 05:25.760
that there's a little space in here, right? Where the quarters don't quite touch. And

05:25.760 --> 05:30.800
if we fill the triangle in, we see that there's a lot of this overhang on the quarter. So,

05:30.800 --> 05:35.920
how can we make this a more accurate measurement? Well, let's use nickels now. Now, we have

05:35.960 --> 05:41.840
a lot more columns, right? And what we can do is we can add up these columns again and

05:41.840 --> 05:46.880
say, okay, well, there's 36 nickels here. And now if I ask you, how big is this triangle,

05:46.880 --> 05:53.600
what would you say? About 36. And again, we did this by counting up all the columns. And

05:53.600 --> 05:56.880
now if we look at the inside of the triangle, the space in between the quarters are a little

05:56.880 --> 06:01.680
bit less. There's not as big of a gap between the quarters, between the coins, making it

06:01.760 --> 06:06.160
slightly more accurate. And if we draw it, we say that there's a little less overhang,

06:06.160 --> 06:13.160
right? So, let's go even smaller. Let's use a dime. And if we count up all the columns

06:13.160 --> 06:18.360
the same way that we did before, and there's a lot more columns, so it's a little bit harder,

06:18.360 --> 06:25.120
we get 136 dimes. If we put this triangle over, we notice two things. One, the space

06:25.120 --> 06:29.360
is really small now compared to the quarters. It's still definitely there, but it's definitely

06:29.360 --> 06:34.720
smaller space. And if we fill this triangle up, it almost looks perfect. We know that

06:34.720 --> 06:37.840
there's a little bit of space inside that we have to deal with, but as far as overhang

06:37.840 --> 06:43.600
is concerned, it's pretty much gone, okay? It's still there, right? But there's a lot less.

06:44.320 --> 06:49.200
So now let's compare the three triangles we just talked about. The dimes is definitely

06:49.200 --> 06:58.320
the most accurate out of these three. We all agree? So, we look at the columns that we used.

06:58.320 --> 07:04.080
The width of these columns is only as small as the width of this quarter or the coin. And so,

07:04.640 --> 07:09.920
if we say this nickel has half the width of this quarter and that this dime has a quarter,

07:09.920 --> 07:16.320
one-fourth of the width of this coin, we're taking our column and we're making it smaller and smaller

07:16.320 --> 07:22.800
and smaller. If we keep going on forever and ever and ever and making our coin smaller and

07:22.800 --> 07:29.200
smaller and smaller, making the width of this column smaller and smaller, by using smaller

07:29.200 --> 07:34.400
coins, the accuracy is going to keep getting better and better. And if we make it infinity,

07:35.200 --> 07:41.680
our accuracy should be 100% eventually. So, what would that look like? Well, let's take a look.

07:42.320 --> 07:48.880
This is a decent picture of what that might look like. Now, obviously, one over infinity is so small

07:48.880 --> 07:54.240
that we can't really represent it. We can't make an infinitely small column on a computer or even

07:54.240 --> 07:59.440
draw it because we can always make it smaller. We can always add it onto that infinity, but it

07:59.440 --> 08:06.880
might look something like this. And if we zoom in to this corner over here, we have these columns

08:06.880 --> 08:14.880
that go up. And imagine that these are the width of our infinitely small coins. If we add up all

08:14.880 --> 08:20.640
these columns, we would get the area of our triangle and it would be 100% accurate. This is

08:20.640 --> 08:26.880
one of the big concepts that I want to drive home is that one over infinity can be used

08:28.800 --> 08:38.720
to calculate area, to find the area. And this, this is huge because this is one of the principles

08:38.800 --> 08:46.240
of calculus. This is the second most arguably, first most important idea of calculus,

08:46.240 --> 08:53.920
is that if we use infinitely small columns, we can find the area of anything. Okay. I want to

08:53.920 --> 08:58.960
talk about another concept that's really important to calculus, and that has to do with slope. Let's

08:58.960 --> 09:06.480
start by defining what slope is. So, when I think about slope, what I think of is the incline of a

09:06.480 --> 09:13.280
ramp that you're riding from left to right. So, for example, if we have this guy over here,

09:13.280 --> 09:18.560
he's on a skateboard, he's going up this incline, he's going left to right. We say that this is a

09:18.560 --> 09:23.680
positive slope because he's going up. Now, this guy, same skateboarder, maybe he got to the top of

09:23.680 --> 09:29.040
the hill and he goes, oh, I got to go down now. Now he's going down this from left to right. So,

09:29.040 --> 09:35.040
our slope is negative. It's downhill. We understand the difference between those two? Okay. So,

09:35.040 --> 09:40.640
with this, let's move on to talking about apples. Let's say I have 10 apples,

09:42.000 --> 09:49.120
and I eat, I eat five of them in one minute because I'm like a speed apple eater. And now I have two

09:49.120 --> 09:55.440
data points. I have two numbers, two groups of numbers. We can put this on a graph. This line

09:55.440 --> 10:00.880
tells us that if we go to any point on this, on this graph, we can read how many apples we have

10:00.960 --> 10:05.360
at this minute. So, we have this, this line, and what does this look like?

10:07.280 --> 10:13.200
Looks like a slope, right? And we can put our skateboarder on it. So, this guy is going downhill,

10:13.200 --> 10:19.040
so it's a positive or negative? Negative. But what is the value of this slope?

10:20.560 --> 10:28.400
How can we calculate it? And more importantly, what makes this slope right here, so this line,

10:28.400 --> 10:35.040
different from this slope or this slope? What exactly is the numerical difference? What's the

10:35.040 --> 10:39.680
difference in the actual slope between these two? Between these three? What we can do is say that

10:39.680 --> 10:45.760
the slope is equal to the number of apples that I ate over the time that I ate them. If we have this

10:45.760 --> 10:51.200
line, we start at 10, go to five. How many apples did we eat? Five. Five. And how long did it take?

10:51.200 --> 10:57.520
One minute. One minute. So, our slope is going to be negative five. But what if we had a line that

10:57.520 --> 11:03.360
looks a little more complicated? This isn't a straight line. We have a line that looks something

11:03.920 --> 11:12.640
like this. It's not straight. It's not easy to calculate that slope. And the reason is,

11:12.640 --> 11:18.480
is because the slope changes. Let's look at a skateboarder here. He's probably going to go

11:18.480 --> 11:24.480
really fast. Like, that's a pretty drastic drop, right? It's a really negative slope. Do you agree?

11:25.040 --> 11:34.480
And let's say that slope is right here, okay? Pretty negative. And if we put the same skateboarder

11:34.480 --> 11:40.320
over here, he's like riding a flat ground. He's not really going anywhere, right? He's coasting.

11:40.880 --> 11:47.680
So, that slope is maybe somewhere over here. But what's important is that this same graph,

11:47.680 --> 11:53.360
this same line, has many different slopes. Because this is different than this, which is

11:53.360 --> 11:58.880
different than this. And every single point is slightly different slope. So, we want to be able

11:58.880 --> 12:04.640
to say, well, what is the slope at any given time, right? How fast is our skateboarder going

12:04.640 --> 12:11.200
if we follow this line at any given number? So, if we look at this graph, and we sort of have it,

12:11.200 --> 12:16.160
okay? We take it and we cut it in half. So, if you look on the bottom here, it goes from one to ten.

12:17.200 --> 12:22.480
And it looks like a pretty curvy line. Now, let's say that that's one over one. And let's take a

12:22.480 --> 12:27.600
half of that. So, now we go from zero to five. Look at the numbers on the bottom. We go from zero

12:27.600 --> 12:33.760
to five in our time, okay? So, if we go again, now we go from one to two point five. Now it looks

12:33.760 --> 12:40.480
like an even more straight line. And if we go again, one to one point two five, that almost looks

12:40.480 --> 12:44.960
like an exactly straight line. It's slightly different. It's slightly not straight. It has a

12:44.960 --> 12:50.400
slight curve to it. But it's definitely a lot better. And remember, all we did is we went from

12:51.040 --> 12:55.120
ten to five to two point five to one point two five. We kept having that number,

12:55.120 --> 13:01.200
okay? And it looked more and more straight. So, the question is, what are we doing here?

13:01.200 --> 13:06.480
What I would say is that we started at one over one. Let's say we start at one over one and we

13:06.480 --> 13:12.320
have it. We get the one over two. So, now we're at half of our initial graph centered about one,

13:12.320 --> 13:18.000
because one's always there, right? And we have that. Now we're at one over four, following me.

13:18.640 --> 13:24.640
We keep having the length of our graph centered about one. And we're getting this number on the

13:24.640 --> 13:33.040
right is getting closer and closer and closer to one, right? So, what would happen if we go a

13:33.040 --> 13:38.560
distance of one over infinity? It would be a straight line. Remember, infinity is not a number.

13:38.560 --> 13:45.840
Infinity is a concept. And one over infinity is infinitely small. So, we go from one to one

13:45.840 --> 13:53.200
plus one over infinity. And what we see is we recover a straight line. Doesn't that blow your

13:53.200 --> 14:01.840
mind? Remember, we started out at this. And we said, you can't measure that slope, because it's

14:01.840 --> 14:06.400
different everywhere. It's different every single point on this graph has a different slope.

14:07.600 --> 14:14.080
But if we have it more and more and we focus in on one, we focus in right here. We're focusing

14:14.080 --> 14:21.200
on this time. And we look at only that instant of time. It looks like a line. We said before

14:21.200 --> 14:26.000
that every single point has a slope. And we also said that in order to measure that slope,

14:26.000 --> 14:32.960
we need a straight line. So, if we look at an instant in time that is essentially just one point,

14:33.760 --> 14:38.800
we better get a line, because we need a line to measure the slope there. Do you agree?

14:38.880 --> 14:46.320
Yeah. So, this makes complete sense. If we look at a time from one to something just after one,

14:46.320 --> 14:50.800
infinitely close to one, it better look like a line, because we want to be able to measure

14:50.800 --> 14:56.080
that slope, because we know it exists. And that's important, is that we know this slope has to exist.

14:56.080 --> 15:02.160
So, there must be a line there. And the question is, how we have to just be able to look only at

15:02.160 --> 15:09.360
that point in time to find that line? And this is very important, because we can measure the slope

15:09.360 --> 15:15.040
of this line. Based on this picture, we know that it exists and we know that it's calculable. We

15:15.040 --> 15:20.960
know that we can find it if we have the right tools. I want you to leave with this idea that

15:20.960 --> 15:37.520
one over infinity can be used to find the slope of a curved line. And this is also crucial. This is,

15:37.520 --> 15:43.280
remember I said the area was like the central, one of the two central ideas of calculus? This is

15:43.280 --> 15:49.520
the other one. This is the second half of the complete picture of calculus, is that we can use

15:49.600 --> 15:56.880
calculus to not just find the area of the shape, but to find the slope of a function, of a line,

15:56.880 --> 16:04.720
of a graph, that otherwise we wouldn't be able to find the slope of. All right, so let's just recap

16:04.720 --> 16:10.400
what we learned today. We learned, most importantly, that infinity is not a number. Infinity is a

16:10.400 --> 16:19.040
concept. We also learned that one over infinity is not equal to zero. It leads to zero. It goes to

16:19.040 --> 16:24.080
zero. If we look at one over infinity, it gets smaller and smaller and smaller because infinitely

16:24.080 --> 16:31.440
small and goes to zero. And one over infinity allows us to find the area of shapes using really

16:31.440 --> 16:37.120
small, infinitely small columns, which is crazy. If I give you a weird object, like maybe I give

16:37.120 --> 16:42.640
you something that looks like this, how do you find the area of that thing? That's pretty hard,

16:43.200 --> 16:48.640
right? You want to have a formula for that. We want to be able to use the columns. We also showed

16:49.120 --> 16:54.240
that one over infinity allows us to turn a curvy line, a curvy line like this,

16:55.040 --> 17:01.760
into a straight line at a specific point, at a specific time, which is amazing because it allows

17:01.760 --> 17:06.160
us to find the slope at any given time of a line that we normally wouldn't be able to.

17:10.720 --> 17:16.080
Students just beginning to study calculus always find the concepts of limits, derivatives, and

17:16.160 --> 17:22.720
intervals hard to understand. But when these concepts are broken down and explained in new,

17:22.720 --> 17:28.720
unique ways, such as by using coins to visualize intervals, they become infinitely easier to

17:28.720 --> 17:35.120
understand. In fact, the rather unconventional methods for teaching calculus using this video

17:35.120 --> 17:41.040
allowed the same students who usually hate things that were problems to follow these daunting concepts.

17:41.120 --> 17:46.000
You're actually like really, really good at explaining everything. You gave a lot of detail

17:46.000 --> 17:52.080
expand. I think that was like really, it made sense. Like I can understand it, made it easy

17:52.080 --> 17:58.240
to understand what you were trying to say. So next time you hit a roadblock and want to give up

17:58.240 --> 18:04.000
because you just can't grasp a concept right away, take a step back and try to tackle the concept

18:04.000 --> 18:09.360
in a new way, just like we did with using pizza to explain infinity and skateboarders to explain
