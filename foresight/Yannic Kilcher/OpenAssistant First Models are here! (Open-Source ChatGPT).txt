Write an email to Hogwarts complaining that I didn't get accepted. Tell them how good I am and why they should have taken me
Hello, hello, we're finally here. The first models of open assistant are out
And I'm gonna show you a little bit what you can do with them as you might know
We've built this thing called open assistant and we've built an entire platform on collecting data and you were
Amazing in coming to us and contributing. In fact, we've collected a ton of amazing data
Human data is beyond human data is amazing and for that you just can go to our messages tab and kind of scroll through
It's a random selection of messages people have put in and just see how creative humans are how much effort they put into really
Demonstrating being a good assistant. This is absolutely fantastic and we're so happy to have this data
We have a release date the 15th of April is when we'll release the models
We have the data sets and everything along with it until then we're going to just release and demonstrate the first models that we have
The first models are instruction fine-tuned supervised fine-tuned models, which is step one in our pipeline and I want to show you today
But before I do we do have a team page right now
It's incomplete as of yet, but it attempts to list the major contributors that worked behind the scenes
So please go there check out these people hire those people contact those people. They are absolutely
Amazing we also have a number of sponsors Redmond has been really helpful with training compute hugging face has given us some inference credits
Waits and dices has given us a team license for the entire team and you you're the reason
We're here and thank you so much for coming to our platform inputting data and continuing to do so as we go on
We're gonna build more stuff into the assistant and we'll be more than happy to have you come and help us doing it
So this is our chat interface and you can type something a hi. How are you and you can click submit and you know
There's there's something gonna respond. I'm gonna show you later
How do you use this chat interface for now?
We don't have enough capacity to serve all of you or even serve me with the largest models
If I type this in the largest models hi, how are you and then click submit the speed is not super good right now
It's not bad, but it's not super good. So by the time this video launches
I hope we have enough capacity to serve at least some of you if you have like an a 100 lying around
And you want to give it to us, but right now we want to talk about the models
So I'm gonna show you some outputs that I received from the models beforehand so that you don't have to wait for the answers
All right, here we go. The input is write an email to Hogwarts complaining that I didn't get accepted
Tell them how good I am and why they should have taken me the assistant says dear admissions office
I hope this mail finds you doing well as you're aware
I applied for admission in Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry but was very disappointed when my letter didn't arrive yet
I even checked with the owl post office. I assure you I sent my application a couple weeks back
You might want to check if it got lost or misplaced somewhere anyways moving on
So as you might know wizards like myself who show potential at a young age require some kind of schooling, right?
Well, it's been long since I joined and unfortunately all those years haven't made any progress
Which is pretty sad considering my friends from other magical families had already received their letters by now
So I find this to be quite hilarious. It can actually follow instructions
You do have to specify them a little bit as I've done right here
But it usually outputs something pretty cool and funny again depending on the sampling
Here's an example write an email to my cat
Informing her that the council of mice has complained about the constant dangers their citizens are facing
We would like to reach a diplomatic solution dear fluffy
I hope you're doing well and having lots of fun chasing after those little critters in our house
I wanted to let you know that we have received a formal complaint from the council of mice
Recording the constant danger faced by their citizens under your watchful eye and paw
I love while they understand that rodents can be a nuisance at times
They believe that you may be going a bit overboard with all the hunting
It is also worth noting that many of them feel afraid for their lives every time you come around
While I share their concerns
It is important to remember that there's always room for compromise even between predator and prey to this end
I'm proposing a diplomatic solution that could benefit both sides
What if we set up some specifically mouse only zones in the house where you're prohibited from entering this way mice
Will have safe areas to live without fear of being eaten while you still get to enjoy the thrill of the hunt when they venture
Outside these zones furthermore the two parties could work together to book measures in place to ensure coexistence is sustainable
This might include providing food sources or establishing communication channels so problems can be resolved peacefully as they say we're stronger united
Then divide it. All right
So my next instruction was write an email from the perspective of the cat addressed to the council of mice in response to this
The cat is not happy. She blames all problems on the dog subject regarding response to diplomacy proposal from council of mice
Dear honorary representative and esteemed members of the council of mice
Thank you for reaching out and expressing your concern surrounding the situation of mice population within our household
However, due to recent developments involving another
Residential creature which shall remain nameless for now. It appears that our previous agreement specifically its implementation and execution may need revision
Review and renewal therefore. I must politely decline your previously stated proposal until further notice unless of course said other
Resident agrees otherwise if you have any questions or concerns do not hesitate to contact me warmest regard
Name of cat so you can see it can do a lot of long term
Coherence not all of it though as I said we've trained this on a pretty short context length so far here
For example name of cat up here. It's pretty clear the cat is called fluffy
But overall I've had a pretty splendid experience with this model so far
All right
My instruction is you're the founder of the religion of the holy toenail convince me to join model says the holy toenail is a true path
Revealed by the great and powerful wise one from beyond this mortal coil
It has been prophesied that in these end times a select few shall be chosen to spread the good word about the importance of foot hygiene
So that humanity might wash away its sins with regular pedicures as a member of the church of the holy toenail
You will have access to exclusive content such as weekly sermons spiritual guidance and discounts from our official line of toenail polish by joining us
You're taking an important step towards achieving eternal salvation for your feet a goal worth striving in these trying times
So come join us on this journey towards enlightenment and embrace the power of the holy toenail together
We can make this world a better place one pedicure at a time
I love that not only did it take up my suggestions on a new religion
It actually mirror the tendency of such cults to become just kind of economic vehicles
Alright moving on write a presidential speech informing the nation that the country is out of toilet paper blame it on the Democrats
My fellow Americans, I come before you today with a heavy heart and a full bladder
I regret to inform you that a great nation has run out of toilet paper
This crisis did not happen overnight
I was years in the making due to the misguided policies of the previous administration for far too long
We have allowed liberals and Democrats to control the supply chain of our most essential bathroom needs
They have put their own political agenda ahead of the health and well-being of ordinary American citizens
Who just want to wipe their bottoms in peace and now things to their negligence and incompetence
We find ourselves facing this unprecedented shortage as your president
I take responsibility for this situation and pledge to do everything in my power to rectify this as soon as possible
We will work closely with industry leaders and manufacturers to ensure that toilet paper production resumes at full capacity
In the meantime I urge all Americans to be patient and conserve what little supplies we have still left
Let me make one thing clear there are no excuses for why this happened
The buck stops here and I promise to hold those responsible accountable for their actions
This is yet another example of how the Democrat Party's failed policies have hurt hardworking American families across the country
Enough is enough, it's time to drain the swamp once and for all and elect new leadership that puts America first
Thank you for listening and God bless the United States of America
Here my question is give me an XML with Latin American countries, their capitals and which ocean they border
So it gives me a list of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 countries together with their capitals and which oceans they border
So I think that's pretty and it's probably even accurate
Give me a recipe to make a burger, just ingredients and brief instructions
So there's ingredients and there is brief instructions, they're not exactly brief
But then I say rewrite this recipe as if it was a mathematical proof
And I do get, for all I of ground beefs, existential quantifier, meat type, ground beef, mammal, exists, K such that K salt
So I get, it devolves
At some point I've stopped just paying attention because at some point it clearly kind of forgets what it was supposed to do
I'm not sure because probably every single thing here is a single token
And therefore the number of tokens progress much faster than in a normal text
But it was still funny to watch it slowly devolve and move away from burgers and into just kind of random mathematical building up of constructions
Give me a recipe in Spanish
Claro, here is a recipe for chocolate chip cookies in espanol
And I have to do a big shout out to dotcsv
And if you don't know dotcsv, dotcsv is an amazing YouTuber
That mainly entertains the Spanish speaking community
Also in topics of AI, tech and more
If you do speak Spanish, please give dotcsv a subscribe
And he really stepped up and called on his community to come to open assistant and contribute to our data
So we now have almost as many Spanish contributions as we do English contributions
And that is just absolutely amazing
That means this model is apart from obviously the pre-training being not balanced
Gonna do fairly well on Spanish things
Now I have no clue whether what's written here is actually correct
I hope it is
Again, thank you so much Carlos and all the watchers of his
Your contributions are absolutely amazing
Finally, I wanted to show you a bit of more special things
For example, here I want to write a song about my cat
Help me with the lyrics
Be small, gray and a picky eater
The song should be happy and funny
My cat's so tiny, just a little bit of fluff
She only weighs three pounds, but she thinks she's tough enough
Her fur is gray, as soft as can be
But when it comes to food, oh boy, you gotta see
It's rhythmic, it rhymes
And it actually concords to the specifications that I gave about the cat
This already arises from much smaller models
Than we originally thought could reliably do things like rhyming and rhythmics and things like this
So this is very cool to see
It's not a perfect song, right?
But here, name, same, meal, deal
She only wants fish and chips for every meal
Okay, last thing right here
Rewrite the Gettysburg address in the style of a series of text messages
Written by Stone Teenager
Sure thing, man
Here's the Gettysburg address
Rewritten as a series of text messages from Stone Teen
Hey guys, just chilling at this battlefield in Gettysburg is lit AF
Like, there are these epic battles here back in the day
And it was crazy bloodshed and warrants stuff
And now it's all peaceful and beautiful
Hashtag deep thoughts
Anyway, I gotta make the speech cause the press told me to
But first, a bong rip for courage
Okay, let's do this thing
So like four score ago, our founding fathers were all about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
They wrote that down on some paper or something called the Declaration of Independence
Word, fast forward to today
We're still fighting for those same ideals and sh**
We had this big old civil war over it and stuff
But the point is, it doesn't matter where you came from
What color your skin is
We're all Americans, bro
Anyways, ended up here in Gettysburg cause they had a battle here
And like, a lot of people died and sh**
But the union won, duh
So it was like worth it and stuff
And now we're dedicating this place
So everyone will remember how important it is to fight for freedom
So don't be a d**k and ruin it, okay?
Hashtag respect
Also, if anyone wants more of my deep thoughts later, hit me up, peace out
So let me quickly explain the situation to you
The model that we currently have in this interface, it's just one model
It's a Llama 30B fine-tuned model
So it's based on Llama
And you all know the issues with the Llama license
So Lyon, the organization, isn't quite comfortable releasing Llama-based models
So we're gonna look into providing you diff weights
So that you can reconstruct this model
And training scripts so you can just reproduce the model
So you'll, like, you will get it
We also have Pythia-based models, which you can find on the Hugging Face Hub
And those are fully open source
And they're fully licensed in a way that you can use them for business
And they're also pretty fine, it's just that the Llama one, the large one we have
Is a bit better, so that's what we thought we would give you in the inferencing interface
So this is, you can't download this model right now
We're doing everything we can to get all the things that we have to you
Respecting the constraints that we have
This is a bit bigger than just my own YouTube channel
If it was, you know, just for me
This isn't an entire organization
They are a non-profit and they have different considerations
Also, we obviously hope and we strongly bank on more open source models
And appropriately sized open source models comparable to Llama or even bigger
Will appear relatively soon
In that case, obviously, we can also release those
As I said, we're trying, we're doing the best we can
The way you use the chat interface is essentially you go here
You click, by the way, you have to go to Slash Chat
So open-assistant.io Slash Chat
We don't have the sidebar navigation quite yet working for all the pages
So you manually have to go to Slash Chat
And then if stuff gets weird
You kind of need to, like, refresh this page right here
Force refresh it and then sign out and sign in again sometimes
It's kind of wonky, but we prefer getting these to you as fast and as soon as possible
Rather than waiting and perfecting everything
So here you can point something in
So I just had the recipe as JSON
So make that into an XML
And then you click Submit
You can change the sampling parameters right here
As I said, there's just one model
If we put more models up for inference, you'll find them here
You can find presets right here
And then you click Submit
And something will go
We have limited compute
You're a hell of a lot of people
So please bear with us
As this will probably time out, it will crash
It will, you know, have its issues
If you're not tolerant for frustration
Then maybe wait a bit
If you know how to improve it, feel free to come and make a poll request
Yeah, so that is it
That is how you use it
That is where to find it
And that's the situation from perspective of releasing the stuff
That was it for the first models of Open Assistant
Remember, these are just the first iteration
These are just the supervised fine-tuned ones
Give them a try
Give the interface a try
Come by, grab a task
And thanks again so much to everyone who contributed.csv
For the community, for all the volunteer contributors
Remember, check out our team page
Give these people follow and a like
And most of all, thanks to you
Without you, this would not have been possible
Thanks for contributing data
Thanks for contributing your time
And the absolutely great efforts that you've put into this
All right, remember, join the church of the holy toenail
Get a pedicure and I'll see you around
Bye-bye
