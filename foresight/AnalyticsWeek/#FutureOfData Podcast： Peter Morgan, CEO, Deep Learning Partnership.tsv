0	14040	Welcome to future data podcast. In this episode, we'll talk to Peter Morgan around AI machine
14040	29880	learning and deep learning. So stay tuned.
29880	36400	So welcome everyone to future of data podcast. Today we have with us Peter Morgan. He is
36400	44880	with deep learning partnerships along the line of one of the very crucial area artificial
44880	50840	intelligence. We would learn today some of the fun stuff what the AI is what deep learning
50840	59640	is and Peter, thank you so much. I truly appreciate you stepping up and helping and helping our
59640	64360	audience understand what deep learning is what AI is. So why don't we start with your
64360	70720	introduction. I saw that you have a physics major and so you have a scientist from physics
70720	74680	background. What are you doing in AI? So love to know that journey.
74680	80200	Yeah, that's good. That's a good journey to describe try to describe right connected
80200	86160	thoughts. So I did start my life as you know, very interested in science, it was curiosity
86160	91680	I guess and how things work. And I guess that's carried on into AI. You know, how does the
91720	97680	brain work, right? How does intelligence work? So that underlying sense, I think I'm not
97680	101560	doing anything different really, I'm just exploring stuff that I like to explore. I've
101560	105920	been lucky in life in that way. I've just kept exploring where my passion is taking
105920	109840	me and my passion is taking me definitely into AI today. And I have been working in
109840	115680	it for four years. But yeah, just to go back, I did do I was working on a PhD in physics
115840	122960	at University of Massachusetts at Amherst and here in particular theoretical particle physics.
122960	128560	So a lot of math, right? So that helps me actually in AI because you know, it's quite
128560	135440	mathematical. You know, there's two types of AI just like any any subject is theoretical AI and
135440	141440	it is practical. Let's build it AI. Okay. So, you know, I am interested in the theoretical
141440	146400	and the pinnings of you know, how it all works. So, you know, mathematically, it's good, I can
146400	152560	do the math essentially, because of my strong physics background, physics and math. But yeah,
152560	157200	businesses want to apply this stuff too. And I do have a consulting company, which you mentioned
157200	162560	deep learning partnership. So yeah, the hands on is something as well. That's the other side
162560	168960	that I need to be able to, you know, bring to the table. Yeah. Interesting. So thank you for
168960	175760	the quick introduction. So I think one of the one of a good friend of ours, he suggested that if you
175760	181120	want the best data scientist, look for particle physicists, because they pretty much spend their
181120	186800	time looking for the tiny, tiny sort of be tiny sort of the hiccups. Yeah, that's, that's where
186800	192240	most of the anomalies are. And you want sort of professionals who are very focused on in finding
192240	197040	those sort of anomalies, because that's where that's where the big, big opportunities are.
197040	201440	Yeah, I think so. And it's such a new field developing rapidly, there's a lot of stuff
201440	205440	still to be discovered, actually. So yeah, it is nice, nice area to be in.
205440	211600	Nice. So tell me about deep learning. Like, what do you guys do from the talent of it?
211600	215680	Like, what do we have enough to know what deep learning partnership is all about?
216240	221200	Yeah, so that's a company I founded actually about 18 months ago in London, I've just been
221200	228880	over to the US. So I'm a consulting company. And I hire people and as and when, you know,
228880	235520	we get engagement. So most recently, I've been helping to develop a AI bootcamp deep learning
235520	240640	bootcamp in New York City. And it was the first of its kind in the world. So there's a lot of
240640	245760	data science boot camps, which I actually helped out one here in London develop as well. So this
245760	251840	is taking it to the next stage, which is, you know, AI bootcamp deep learning. And already
251840	257040	that we're seeing our competitors, other data science companies starting to offer, you know,
257040	263280	eight week, 12 week deep learning courses. So we're nicely ahead of the curve, you know, I can,
264320	270560	you know, so I can kind of, you know, feel a little bit happy that, you know, I predicted
270640	276400	something that looks like it will happen, you know, so and then we're also doing consulting
276400	283840	engagement into companies as well, like bank banking, retail healthcare. So that's, yeah,
283840	290160	so it's a young company, you know, when work comes along, you know, I try to try to accept it and
290160	296560	bring people on board to help me if we need extra people. So but in general, the market itself is
296560	302160	big and getting bigger exponentially. So I think we're well placed to, you know, continue training
302160	307680	and consulting in this marketplace deep learning. Interesting. So I have a question definitely.
307680	312240	So why deep learning particularly? So there's a machine learning has a lot of other areas.
313200	318480	What brings you to deep learning? That's a good question, Vishal. So deep learning really is
318480	322880	state of the art. And it's the one that's outperforming the other algorithms. I might even
322880	328960	call it good old fashioned AI, machine learning. And machine learning included, you know, random
328960	334800	forests, all the Kaggle winners support vector machine just straying out some technical jargon
334800	339600	here, you know, names of algorithms, well known algorithms that have been very successful for
339600	345520	the last, you know, 30 years or even more some in some cases. So why deep learning and why now?
345520	350560	So these algorithms have been around since the 70s and maybe even earlier, some of the
351200	358320	rudimentary ones, 50s even, even 40s, I think, you know, McCulloch and Pitts wrote down, you know,
358320	363040	how an artificial neural, how the mathematics behind how a neuron works, right? And so
363040	368560	these are artificial neural networks. So it's the same math. So why now, you know, well, basically
368560	375120	it's a hardware and data play. So the hardware we have all the Nvidia GPUs with 8000 cores,
375120	380400	etc. 100 teraflops, you can buy a server, put it under your desk, 100 teraflops. They used to
380400	385120	be a supercomputer 10 years ago. So we have the hardware now, we have the hardware. So now we
385120	391440	can throw the data, we also have the big data sets. So we have ImageNet and other million or
391440	396400	more greater labeled data sets. So we have the data, we have the hardware, we've always had the
396400	401600	algorithm. So we're just putting all three together in the perfect storm. And it turns out that neural
401600	407120	networks outperform all the other algorithms. And why is that? Well, there's something called the
407120	415680	universal approximation theorem, which says that a single layer neural network can approximate
415680	421360	any function to any degree of accuracy. Now, that's a very, very powerful statement. And it is
421360	427280	provable. And it was proven in the 80s by a couple of different teams. And so that's why, okay, that
427280	433200	may sound a little technical. But basically, nature's had 4.5 billion years to trial, try everything,
433280	438160	right? And biology and the laws of physics are such that, you know, and the universal
438160	444000	approximation theorem is the mathematical, you know, statement behind it all says, here's the
444000	449200	most efficient and effective way of processing information. Because at the end of the day,
449200	452720	this is all about processing information, isn't it? Whether it's business information,
452720	458000	science information, or any type of, you know, Facebook information, social media, any type
458000	462480	of information. It just turns out that neural networks are the most accurate and efficient
462480	467200	way of doing that. And biology is clever, right? It's tried everything trial and error, it's had
467200	472560	failures, it's had successes, we've had Einstein, we've had people who aren't clever criminals,
472560	479520	etc. But ultimately, neural networks are the, you know, the most effective way of information,
479520	484720	processing information. And that's deep and very fundamental. And I don't hear many people talking
484720	488720	about it, in fact, but really, that that should be the starting point for any discussion.
489280	493680	That's definitely a very interesting perspective. I've been a big fan of neural
493680	499680	networks, at least from my graduation days. So I've not heard about it since then. But yeah,
499680	506160	I think that I have another friend in neural network space for me. So let's talk about deep
506160	510640	learning. So what, like for our audience, if you can shed some light on what is deep learning?
510640	517280	Yeah, so it's basically another name for artificial neural networks, okay, and I like it
517280	520720	because it's it's easier to say than artificial neural network. So, you know, it's
522320	529440	so the deep part just means it's more than one layer. So, you know, two plus 100 1000 layers,
529440	533760	that's the deep part, you have many, many hidden layers in your neural networks, you have an input
533760	539200	layer and an output layer, and then one or more in the middle. And if it's more than one layer,
539200	544640	remember, the universal approximation theorem says you only need one layer. But the more layers
544640	550800	you have, you know, the quicker it will converge. So, and there's a lot of trade off, no one knows
550800	555440	exactly the right configuration for any particular data set. So there's a this is where all the
556560	563120	room for success really, in scientifically and in business lies, that's a great opportunity
563120	566960	right there. That's a challenge, but also an opportunity for businesses, if they can come
566960	571840	up with a neural network architecture, the number of layers and a number of nodes in each layer,
571840	576400	that is more ideal than your competitor, then you're going to be able to process your data
576400	580320	quicker and more accurately. And that's your competitive edge right there. This field is
580320	584480	changing very quickly. There's a lot of teams on this right now in science and in industry,
584480	592080	like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu, IBM. So, every day papers are coming out on archive,
592080	597280	you know, it's very exciting for me as a scientist actually here in business as well,
597280	603840	moving very rapidly. Interesting. And so, I think, so let's talk about one of the use case. So,
603840	608560	if you can sort of make it very, very sort of simple down to maybe for a five-year-old level,
608560	616000	right? So, what is deep learning as seen by, say, a typical use case? So, to help help me
616000	620640	and our audience understand what is deep learning, that would be helpful. Sure. So, we can split it
620640	625520	into two things. One is image processing and one is language processing, if you like. So,
625600	630960	if our data set consists of images, then we would use something called CNNs or convolutional
630960	635440	neural networks and the other type of neural networks called RNNs or recurrent neural networks,
635440	640240	they're used to process language information, whether that's speech or text, okay? In fact,
640240	646080	any time series, whereas video stream, market data, text or speech, RNNs. So, RNNs are perhaps
646720	651280	the more complicated because they're having to deal with the time series element, they have an
651280	658320	extra time element. CNNs are pretty much a solved technology, if you like, because they're processing
658320	663920	pixels and stationary images. So, whatever use case you can think for a company who wants to
663920	672000	develop and get value out of processing images or processing text, speech, market data, now,
672000	677600	that's any company in any vertical, it's basically unlimited, right? So, any use case you can think
677760	681600	of, I mentioned market data, so algorithmic traders on Wall Street are now using neural
681600	689520	networks to get the high-frequency trading advantage. Healthcare is a great one for me
689520	694080	because it's saving lives and curing cancer and helping us to live longer and better quality
694080	702720	lives. So, for example, radiology, FMRI scans, X-ray scans, these are images, right? And so,
702800	708000	you have a thousand images or a million, you can scan these very quickly using CNNs, okay?
708000	714160	And they can now do that more accurately and faster than any human radiologist who get paid
714160	721520	for $500,000 a year. And so, obviously, hospitals, so there's a lot of jobs in danger right now.
721520	725520	We talk about technological unemployment and these are high white collar jobs too,
725520	731120	not just robots and factory jobs, but yeah. So, that's a side issue, isn't it? We're getting
731120	738080	away from technology, but this has great social and political and economic ramifications that the
738080	744000	fact that these neural networks are going to replace our neural networks. Yeah, no, I think
744000	749600	that's well said. And in fact, I was having a conversation with one of the, I think he was
750320	755680	one of the executive friends and we had this conversation on that. I was reading an article
755680	764960	that the easiest job to replace by an AI is CEOs. So, that's like, so yeah, so I think that's why
764960	770800	and they are the, they are the one who paid the most in this equation. So, definitely,
772800	779920	it's funny how will and when will sort of, I'll have an AI boss. In fact, I do, like in my company,
779920	788240	there's something called Tau. It's a talent, it's an AI around career coaching. So, Tau is
788240	797520	in my boss. So, I'm kind of, so I think it'll be a fun drive to see how creepy or how cool that boss is.
797520	801920	Yeah, exactly. So, and then it brings up, so what are we going to do now that we're displaced for the
801920	806640	first time in history, right? We've had blue collar displacement through the industrial revolution
806640	810880	and PCs, right? But now, it's really, we're going to be able to replace everybody now,
810880	816080	including white collar CEOs, lawyers, doctors, everybody will be replaced eventually.
817280	822640	And it's happening now. So, how are we going to eat and live and survive? So, people are talking
822640	827680	about a universal basic income where the wealth is distributed because the wealth has been concentrated
827680	834640	more and more on a few, right? Google, Facebook, etc. And so, before I used to have IBM and AT&T
834640	839360	with a million, two million employees. And so, they were big companies, but that's,
839360	844480	the wealth was distributed amongst a lot of people. Now, Facebook can kind of have 20,000
844480	850960	employees and be bigger than AT&T and IBM combined. And so, you know, it really is, the inequality is
850960	855760	more than it ever has been in history in moving quicker and quicker. So, yeah, universal basic
855760	861840	income is kind of, which is basically another word for taxation and tax of rich and everything else.
861840	867280	And that really isn't... I think that's a scary slope. Yeah. Yeah, but it's something we have to
867280	874160	face is humanity, right? We do have to, and it's better to face it hit on now than wait, you know,
874160	879840	until it's kind of everybody's starving and in the street and... No, I think that's a very valid
879840	888080	point. And again, I think I'll be pushing my shameless plug here. But I think one of the
888080	894560	things that got us started in AI was the very fact that almost every AI is talking about
895760	902000	sort of shifting jobs or taking away jobs, but there's no AI to actually help save it, right?
902000	909120	So, there's a... So, I think where we are banking on is primarily there's a very broad area emerging
909120	914640	in which what if I'm an AI and I can help you stay employed? So, if suppose I'm seeing a new
914640	922960	trend, and one of the typical use that we give out is that say an example of an autonomous car
922960	928320	phenomena takes a truck driver's job away, right? So, what if we have a network of
928320	932400	a lot of truck drivers and we see one of one of a couple of those guys actually started doing
932400	937840	something called traffic analytics. So, suddenly sort of the network can propagate and say,
937840	945280	hey guys, why don't we all have a secondary or a tertiary career options? And pretty much like
945280	951840	that this AI is anyways, it's your assistant. It keeps grooming you, it keeps giving sort of these
951840	957520	alternate career options. Because I think the whole point of tech displacement is,
957520	961520	so we can free up our time here, so we can focus somewhere else.
961520	966240	Nice. Exactly, yeah. So, we got a question, you know, what is our purpose? What gives us meaning,
966240	970240	right? And so, for a lot of people getting up in the morning going to work, and that's fine too,
970240	975920	but that really won't be there for much longer. So, I'm a real optimist here and that we will
975920	979600	find meaning very easily. It's not something we should worry about, oh my god, we'll never have
979600	985440	meaning without work. I think we replace that with something else. As long as the, you know, we can
985440	990560	eat and have a roof over our heads and have an internet connection, Wi-Fi, right, basic human
990560	996320	right these days, we'll be good. It's a different world, we will get used to it,
996320	1000080	but we've had four shifts already. We've had farming, we've had the industrial revolution,
1000080	1005440	we've had the PC and now the AI, and we've always moved. 98% of people used to work in farms,
1005440	1011200	now it's one lesson of 2%, okay, everything's automated on farms. So, we've moved comfortably
1011200	1018400	into industrial factories, and then we've moved comfortably into basically PCs and, you know,
1018400	1023840	cubicles, and now we're actually going to be free. It's almost like we're taking the chains off,
1023840	1029840	you know, we need to do what we want. For me, that's great, as long as there's enough that we
1029840	1036480	can eat, nobody gets left behind. So, I think that's a very noble thought. So, now let's talk
1036480	1042960	about businesses, right? So, let's sort of try to understand their problem. Say I'm a small business,
1043760	1047920	why would I care about something called AI, or why would I care about something called
1047920	1054000	machine learning? What are some of those pitches to those businesses who have,
1054640	1059200	anyways, no technical know-how, and they've been sort of getting this anxious about this emerging
1059200	1064560	keyword and jobs getting lost in all that phenomena. Yeah, so, yeah, you know, slightly
1064560	1068640	flippant is because Google are using it in all of their products and they're the second largest
1068720	1074240	company in the world. So, yeah, it works, okay? Now, that's it. That's the bottom line, okay?
1075280	1079840	Facebook too, and all the major tech company, Baidu, IBM, Microsoft, they're all using it.
1079840	1083920	They're all just replacing everything, all their algorithms, neural networks, okay? So,
1083920	1089440	if you're not sold on that, you might say, okay, well, that's okay for the big guys with all the tech,
1089440	1093600	but it's not that because they're using it in every product imaginable. HR,
1094080	1100880	search, just everything, okay? So, these big tech companies, even though they're tech companies,
1100880	1106160	they have the same functional units as any company, right? They have HR, they have legal,
1106160	1110720	they have accounting, they have all of these other departments, okay? So, that's one argument. The
1110720	1116320	second argument is, okay, so what do you guys do? What's your core competence? Okay, you're in
1116400	1123360	healthcare, okay? You're a legal company, you're retail, etc., okay? Here's how neural networks are,
1123360	1128800	not can be, but are being used by other legal companies right now, and medical companies,
1128800	1134160	and retail companies like Amazon, for example. Here's how, like Jeff Bezos three weeks ago
1134160	1138640	had an interview where he said, you know, neural networks, AI deep learning, you know,
1138640	1142640	he actually mentioned those words, you know, straight to the point, we're using them in
1142640	1147840	everything now, it really is our driver, our key driver at Amazon is deep learning now. So,
1147840	1152960	Amazon Alexa, Amazon X, so you mentioned these digital assistants, right? Well, that's the
1152960	1158320	natural language processing I talked about, RNNs. So, we're all going to have one, we kind of have
1158320	1164640	them now, Siri, Cortana, Google, now, but they'll just get better and better the more data they're
1164640	1170960	trained on, okay? They're like us as human beings, we were young, we get trained alphabet and numbers
1170960	1177360	and how to do math and how grammar works, okay? These things are capable of learning and getting
1177360	1183360	trained, the more data we give to them, whether it's medical data, our own data, so they help us,
1183360	1188560	or if I'm a healthcare or a retail company, the more data I can feed into it, either from
1188560	1194240	external sources or internal, the more it can help, the better a job it can do at helping us. So,
1194800	1198240	I don't know if that's answered your question, I've kept it very general rather than do a very
1198240	1203520	specific use case, but there are examples in the legal industry, there are companies now who use
1204320	1209760	neural networks, deep learning is paralegal, so basically quickly scan all the documents much
1209760	1216480	quicker than any young 20-year-old paralegal can and more accurately too. So, there's an example,
1216480	1221440	so the natural language processing, the technology's at the point where they can understand, it's
1221440	1226560	actually natural language understanding, written tech, so any company that uses people to read
1226560	1232640	and process and make decisions, I mentioned a legal one, can basically replace that process,
1232640	1238240	human beings with these neural networks, okay? Sounds scary. So, your sales pitch is to these
1238240	1246640	businesses is that everyone is using it and it's actually showing some real impact in the economic
1246640	1251680	structure of the businesses and almost all the verticals, as you're saying, are seeing an impact
1252640	1258720	or at least the incentive of going in this direction, so you should try it out too.
1258720	1264400	Yeah, but not say that's more of a leap of faith, right? It's more like, and here's how,
1264400	1269200	here's how these legal companies are using it, here's how Cisco are using it, here's how Amazon
1269200	1273440	are using it, in real use cases, because this information is public information, the actual
1274400	1278720	nitty-gritty fine points aren't because that's their competitive advantage, but the general
1278800	1283920	way, the use cases are definitely, I could Google now, you could too, anybody can, all the listeners,
1284480	1291360	Google neural networks, legal applications, and there'd be a hundred examples of companies
1291360	1298480	how they're using it, okay? It's not a secret. Right, interesting, interesting. So, now let's
1298480	1306560	talk about, I think, I'll go slightly on the technical aspect of deep theoretical AI. I think
1306560	1313120	one of the so-called drawbacks, or one of the right-handers in using these capabilities is
1314240	1320320	analysis paralysis, right? Creating the boundaries on where does it really end? When should the
1320320	1325760	learning begins and where should the learning stops? So, what are some of your thoughts around
1325760	1333440	those challenges for businesses? So, if I let my AI, in a deep learning case, if it can create,
1333520	1340960	say, multiple neural network nodes, layers, so then it can actually, it can extrapolate,
1340960	1347120	and then it can sort of dig deeper than it should, and it can connect two sort of non-related dots,
1347120	1352000	because somehow we are all connected, but not really from the business sense point of view.
1352640	1356480	So, how would you, what are some of your thoughts in that direction, if at all?
1356480	1360480	Yeah, so that's a good question. It's an ongoing area of development. So,
1360720	1366960	you know, how can I, who's to say that this 100-layer neural network with a million nodes at
1366960	1372480	each layer, okay, so that's 100 million nodes, which a GPU these days can easily handle, okay?
1372480	1376880	10 years ago, it would have been, my God, that's going to take us a week to feed out
1376880	1382640	a million images or whatever text into it. Today, that can be done in half an hour using a new hardware.
1382640	1388720	So, that's, hardware is not an issue, but so how do I know if it's 99 layers, or 101 layers,
1388800	1393200	or 100 layers, right? And that's the fair question, and how do I know if it's a million nodes,
1393200	1398160	or 2 million there, right? We're not really constrained by layers or nodes anymore. Hardware
1398160	1405120	is good, good to go. So, that is, there's still a little bit, it's more of an art than a science
1405120	1409200	still. There's a little bit of, you know, magic in there, a little trial and error, not really
1409200	1414080	magic, but trial and error for sure. You know, the guys at Google, they kind of give you an
1414080	1418560	answer, right? The guys who write the scientific paper, they've done a lot of exploration that,
1418560	1424320	you know, we haven't, but they still, it's, it's, wow, you know, here's, here's, here's what we got
1424320	1430320	by trying different, it's an empirical science at the moment, okay? The underlying theory isn't
1430320	1435520	solved completely yet, okay? That's, that's the exciting part for me, actually, right?
1436880	1442400	Interesting, interesting. So, thank you so much for, for shedding, setting your thoughts on,
1442480	1447280	on that. So, now, let's talk about, again, get back to that, that business thingy, right? So,
1447280	1452080	I'm a business. So, you told me that, hey, everyone is doing it, you should do it too. There's,
1452080	1457280	there are some real numbers, real impact. Sure, I'm sold. So, now, what are some of, like,
1458560	1463680	first three steps that you would suggest to a small business that have no freaking clue?
1463680	1467840	Yeah. What, that, what AI even means, let alone using it in their business?
1467840	1471840	Sure, sure. What are some of the things that you can say, hey, maybe do these three things?
1472800	1476720	Get yourself seen or something. Yeah, well, I think, first of all, education is important.
1476720	1482480	You know, here's what a, here's what a neural, here's what a deep learning network, AI network,
1482480	1487440	here's what machine learning means. You know, here's why we are here today. Here's why companies are
1487440	1492640	using it. And here's where we are, you know, honestly, state of the art. And here's some
1492640	1497120	examples of how Google have used it or somebody, you know, if they're a law firm, here's some
1497120	1504000	examples of how, you know, your competitors are using it now and really impacting them.
1504000	1508800	You know, not, not just they're trying it out. Let's see how they go, really getting results
1508800	1513120	and have been for the last two or three years. Okay. The stuff hasn't just happened today,
1513120	1519680	it's been around a while. So, probably five years ago, they call it the big bang, really. So,
1519680	1524560	it's been around, it's not just starting today. It's, you know, it's, it's not a mature industry,
1524560	1530800	but there are people who have had these stuff for a good three years, right? So, that's not new.
1530800	1538880	They use it today, right? So, you're saying education is number one, that you said, like,
1538880	1544800	educate yourself. What are the other two things that a small business could do to get good?
1544800	1549040	Yeah. So, that's education. That's number one. That's good. And so, number two, probably then,
1549040	1553040	obviously, it's the same process. So, new technology, same processes. Some things don't
1553520	1556400	change. Proof of concept, right? Let's have a little trial. Let's put a,
1557360	1562560	let's run it on a small cluster, one computer, a small cluster on your laptop, something,
1562560	1568000	and feed this data set in, this small data set, you know, a subset of your larger data set,
1568000	1572480	the legal company. Let's just feed it a thousand documents, not a million, right?
1572480	1578320	And on your laptop, with this neural network, it could be off the shelf open source. Okay. A lot
1578320	1582800	of this stuff's open source, which is accelerating it. So, it could be TensorFlow. Okay. It could be
1582800	1589280	MXNet. It could be CNTK. And that's the Google, Amazon, and Microsoft versions in that order,
1589280	1595280	Facebook use Torch. Okay. So, as a consultant, I should know which one probably is the better
1595280	1600240	choice for your data set, actually. That's the value that I would add. Okay. Rather than trying
1600240	1604720	them all one at a time, I could say, actually, well, you know, TensorFlow is probably better choice
1604720	1610240	than CNTK or Weisweiser, and here's why. Okay. So, that will save you time and money.
1610240	1614160	But that's a proof of concept. And if it helps, if it works, if you're convinced,
1615360	1620720	at the results of a small data set running on a small piece of hardware, then we could scale it
1620720	1625440	up. Let's put all your data in, and let's use a cluster, right? A cluster computing,
1626800	1632400	you know, not necessarily Hadoop, but the whole, you know, distributed processing cluster,
1632400	1637120	cluster computing. Let's run it on the cloud. Let's run it on Amazon, if you're happy with that,
1637120	1642960	or else in your own data center. So, let's scale it up now from one to 100 nodes. Okay.
1642960	1648880	And let's put all your data set in there, you know. Interesting. Step three. Yeah.
1648880	1655440	Yeah. I think that that's great. So, get a trial run and then use one of the frameworks.
1655440	1661680	So, now, I think, and again, I'm taking slight detour. And I think because you peak my interest
1661680	1669680	around TensorFlow and MXNet and CentOS and Keras, which one is your favorite and which
1669680	1674160	and why and which was the least favorite and why? Yeah, probably TensorFlow, I like. A number of
1674160	1681280	users are approaching 50,000 on GitHub, which is the highest ever, you know, even more than Linux.
1681280	1687440	This is happening so fast, exponential, very steep. So, that's one reason, the popularity.
1687440	1691440	Second reason, Google's behind it, and they have very good engineers, and people do respect them
1691440	1699360	for that. Okay. And the third reason is that, you know, looking at these myself, evaluating,
1699360	1703520	looking at the code and the examples, you know, TensorFlow is good. It's got a good documentation.
1703520	1709040	Yeah, lots of reasons. Okay. Amazon is, they have good engineers too. So, that's not really a
1709040	1715280	differentiator. Why not use MXNet? Well, you can actually, it has, it has, there's always pros and
1715280	1721680	cons. And then CNTK is Microsoft, they have good engineers. And so, you know, why shouldn't I use
1721680	1726960	my, you know, it depends really, okay. And, you know, rather than get into each and every,
1726960	1733600	there's probably 12 metrics on each one. And you could draw a matrix, right? All the open source on
1733600	1740800	on the Y and 12 metrics on the X. And you would have checks in the boxes. And yeah, almost three
1740800	1746000	dimensional, then you have the application as well, dimension. So, it's complicated. You have to
1746000	1750960	know your stuff. And that's where the experts come in and make their money, right? Right. So,
1750960	1759520	now, which one is your least favorite and why? Oh, boy, probably the older ones. I don't know,
1759520	1763520	you know, they, they, they're all, they've all been good in their time, like Tiano,
1764880	1768480	Cafe, we're very good in their time because they're kind of the only one, the only game in town.
1768480	1775360	But now they've been very quickly superseded. When Google announced in November 2015, right,
1775360	1779120	that they're open sourcing, they're basically their artificial neural network, you know,
1779680	1784560	the world changed as far as I'm concerned, because then everybody had to open source theirs.
1784560	1788640	And so that, that really was a big bang. That's a beautiful thing. That's a beautiful thing.
1788640	1792800	Suddenly, Piano didn't, wasn't as competitive anymore. I'm not saying it's bad. It just,
1792880	1798560	it just wasn't as competitive. You know, so there's never been a bad software package. It's just,
1798560	1803520	they get superseded quite quickly. Interesting. Interesting. So now,
1805280	1809360	now let's talk about, let's, let's talk about the industry as such. I think you, you peak,
1809360	1812880	you peak my interest around when you talk about these frameworks. And I think you actually
1812880	1817200	is a very interesting point that most of these vendors now they just came up and they open sourced
1817200	1822720	it to compete with sort of TensorFlow. So I think that's a beautiful thing. So what are some
1822720	1828560	of the nice things you're observing in the industry regarding the adoption of AI? So if you
1828560	1833600	can set some light on that. Yeah, well, for example, it's been very good. It's made everything nice
1833600	1838080	and competitive and everything out in the open. So, you know, MXNet, they keep upgrading,
1838800	1843360	CNTK, the Microsoft one that they went from to, they just released version two a couple of months
1843360	1848320	ago with a heck of a lot more features than they ever would have if Google hadn't have open sourced
1848320	1852560	TensorFlow. So they've all been, everyone has been forced to a work on it very quickly and
1852560	1857760	be open sourced it very quickly too. So not everyone just adopts TensorFlow. So if you look
1857760	1864400	at the GitHub, I think MXNet has got over 10,000, you know, TensorFlow is a clear leader, 50,000,
1864960	1870160	10,000, CNTK, 10,000, which is quite phenomenal, really. It's like, so people aren't just all
1870160	1876080	going for TensorFlow. Okay, they are, you know, they are using the other frameworks as well,
1876080	1879920	whether that's a side-by-side comparison, or we're just going to use it because it's better
1879920	1886800	for our dataset. We're not sure. But so, yeah, competition is always a good thing. And it really
1886800	1894560	does move the field quicker. Nice. Yeah. So now, now let's talk about people a bit. So I have heard
1894560	1901360	about there's a keyword called AI. And I have, I have heard that they have been getting industry's
1901360	1906240	best salaries out there. So I'm interested in getting myself into AI. So what are some of the
1906240	1911040	two to three things you would suggest or you would advise me to get me started?
1911040	1918400	Yeah. So again, I, you know, if you're the CTO, CIO, Chief Data Officer, even CEO in a company or,
1918400	1923040	you know, the, you know, lead architect, and you've heard about AI and you know that you're
1923040	1926880	going to be left behind, you need to start reading up on this stuff. And there's a whole bunch of
1926880	1932640	stuff on the internet, YouTube, beautiful tech tutorials that people have, you know, a love
1932640	1939680	of labor just put it out there for people. Okay. And the internet, you know, can be underestimated
1939680	1943440	the impact that the internet is having on all of this technology development. So that's the
1943440	1948480	platform. People are putting high quality training out there for it. There's no excuse. Okay. It's
1948480	1953840	very easy to learn. Not so many books out there. It's too new, right? It's just moving so quick
1953920	1959440	and it's too new. Stamford is open source, same with MIT and Princeton, all the great universities
1959440	1965920	of the world. Oxford as well have a great course on neural networks, you know, by the
1965920	1972480	top researcher in the world. Same with Stamford, you know, they offer CNNs and RNNs, two separate
1972480	1977600	courses. You know, it's just incredible. I mean, this stuff wouldn't have happened 10 years ago
1977600	1982640	that today. No, I think, I think yes, you are actually raising a very good point that these
1982960	1987760	so there are a lot of good MOOCs out there. Yeah, I think definitely well said that
1988800	1993520	guys should check that out. Yeah, just dive in. That's the main thing. Yeah.
1994880	2001040	Interesting. Interesting. So now, now let's talk about so you said if I'm a business,
2001040	2004080	I should go I should go and check it out. Now let's
2006080	2011840	now let's talk about build versus buy versus like what are some of your thoughts on also
2011840	2018400	if suppose I have no freaking clue what AI is and I've heard and I have seen the impact.
2019440	2024400	What are some of the things you would suggest for me that should I acquire AI talent or should
2024400	2029440	I build and grow an AI talent? Yeah, so that's a great question. So really, you want to get,
2029440	2034320	you know, say let's just use TensorFlow as an example, get your team of architects, you know,
2034320	2038640	so I made a transition, I was a systems engineer for Google IBM as a consultant,
2038640	2043280	I've made a transition myself over to AI deep learning so it can be done if you're a techie
2043280	2048240	kind of minded person and your curiosity will be driving you anyway. I can't imagine there's
2048240	2053200	any CIOs who haven't, you know, done some MOOC or something, right, because that's why you're in
2053200	2058960	the business, you know, you love it because of that. And so the second reason is that commercial,
2058960	2065360	you want your company to succeed, be competitive and to win even, right. So those two are very
2065360	2071520	strong drivers. So you're just going to basically, so let's say TensorFlow, I've done some reading,
2071520	2076400	I'm a CIO, a curious guide, I want my business to succeed, I've seen my competitors already
2076400	2081040	trialing it. Okay, so I'm going to download TensorFlow on my laptop, get some data, get a
2081040	2088160	data set and try it out. Okay, and then, and then get my team up to speed and three or four of us
2088160	2093600	and myself will do a little proof of concept. And then if it works, we'll get the visible
2093600	2099120	show our results to business and give them a business taste, right. And if we get sign off,
2099120	2105840	we'll scale it. Okay. Now, that's us doing it internally. The other way we could do it is go
2105840	2111200	get an Accenture or my company or somebody out there consulting to come in and do it for us. Okay,
2111200	2114960	that's going to be a little more expensive. And at the end, you might not, if something goes wrong,
2114960	2119200	you know, it's not a you'll have to keep paying the money, right. So ultimately, you want to
2119200	2124160	gain this knowledge and do it yourself. How you get there is either go to an outside consulting
2124160	2128640	company or you do it yourself. Probably you might, I don't know, you know, some people,
2129200	2133040	some engineers are very, very clever. And I know they could do it themselves. Others,
2133040	2137520	it's not their core competence, you know, they're Walmart, they may sell products, they're not a,
2137520	2142080	you know, or, you know, a small online retail company with, you know, a single owner,
2142640	2148160	you know, that they're not a techie person, they want to serve people that that's what gives them
2148240	2152800	great joy and pleasure, not so much the technical side, they're going to have to get outside help.
2153440	2160720	That's interesting. I think that's that's a very valid point. So one thing that that we hear a lot
2160720	2167840	from from many of our clients is the concern that market is crowded. So they're like almost every
2167840	2171440	so one, I think one executive put it the best, he said, Vishal, you know what,
2171440	2175360	everyone is trying to sell us, no one is trying to tell us, right. So that's the problem. Okay.
2175360	2182080	So now, in that scenario, like what are some of some of the, some of the idea suggestions that you
2182080	2187360	can give to a bunch of these executives, like if I'm recruiting in a consulting firm, or if I'm
2187360	2192640	recruiting, say, our contractors or whatever, what are some of the things that I should keep in
2192640	2198560	mind? Or what are some of the hacks or some of the tips or tricks that you would suggest that
2198560	2204160	these executives should know, so they can hire the best consulting team further for the job.
2204160	2208640	Yeah. So part of this is being able to sell, right, being a good, you know, part of being a good
2208640	2214560	leader, a consultant is the ability to sell, basically, and not just sell BS, but, you know,
2214560	2219760	you know, it's got to be real. So, you know, that's one of the things, you know, in the past life,
2219760	2224400	my physics, I used to be a teacher, right, so I could teach people new ideas, concepts in the
2224400	2228640	math and everything behind it. It's no different. I just get in there in front of the executive.
2228640	2233120	I think this is a wonderful opportunity for me to help improve the world, basically, right,
2233120	2237120	because we're putting, we're driving stuff forward, automating, making everything more
2237120	2241600	efficient. So I believe in my cause, okay, that's the number one thing, you know, I have the vision,
2241600	2246160	I have the belief, and this is a good thing, it's the right thing for humanity, it's the right thing
2246160	2252720	for business, okay. It's inevitable, a technological unemployment will be worked out, okay. So let's
2252720	2258320	do the best we can. So from there, then you just, it's a matter of selling in the technology,
2258320	2262640	here's a neural network, here's what it looks like, here's the architecture, layers, nodes,
2262640	2267760	here's TensorFlow, here's another one, here's your data set, and here's how, here's your value
2267760	2273600	proposition, that's it. Right. So I think let me put it this way. So if suppose,
2274160	2278640	say you are the business, right, and you want to hire a consulting firm to help your business,
2279280	2282880	so what are like some of two or three sort of things, or what are some of the things that you
2282880	2288160	would consider when hiring a consulting firm to help you? So what are some of the three, two to
2288320	2292960	two things that you would consider as an executive to hire for your company?
2292960	2297280	Yeah, okay, so budget first, okay. If your budget's good, if you're a bigger company,
2297280	2302080	then you go for quality, right? You say, okay, the Accentures, the McKinsey's,
2302080	2306160	you know, the Booz Allen Hamilton's, the Deloitte, you know, people with very strong
2306160	2311120	reputations that they're not strong for, they're strong for a reason, they've been around 100
2311120	2316880	years or 50 years, and you know, they built that reputation, reputation. So it's like buying a car,
2316880	2322400	I've got money so I can go get a Rolls Royce or a Lamborghini, right? Actually, I'm budget limited,
2322400	2327040	so I'm going to, I want the Lamborghini and a Rolls Royce, so I'm going to get a company that
2327040	2332720	I can have faith in, but I can't afford Accenture right now, you know, in the future, I will be
2332720	2337760	that, you know, everybody wants to succeed, but right now, you know, so maybe that's where I would
2337760	2345440	come in, you know, I don't charge the $300 an hour that Accenture might, or however much they,
2345440	2351840	you know, I don't want to boil this down to that, but it's like, okay, you know, I think I can actually
2351840	2357200	do a better job maybe than Accenture. So you're suggesting that budget is a concern, so budget
2357200	2361920	is one concern that you would consider when hiring a consulting firm or a contracting firm,
2361920	2366720	what are some of the other considerations that you think that someone would think about when
2366720	2372080	hiring a firm? Yeah, so quality, definitely the quality factor too, okay, so yeah, not every, you
2372080	2375760	know, if people, the budget and quality are kind of matched, aren't they, if you've got
2375760	2379760	unlimited budget, you probably should go for the best quality, there's no real reason not to, but
2379760	2389440	if so, how do, so is there any, is there any kind of reputation index, or is there anything out there
2389440	2395120	that's supposed, if, how would I know if your firm is any good or better than Accenture? Yeah,
2395120	2401040	or how, like, are there, like, what are some of the tools that I would know, yeah, that for this
2401040	2408560	particular job, for a, for an industry like mine, a boutique firm like yours, Vis-A-Vis of Accenture,
2409120	2414880	like, what are some of, is there anything out there that I can, I can look for, or? Not really,
2414880	2420640	so reputation is, you'll read, yeah, you should do your due diligence, absolutely, yeah, encourage
2420640	2426400	that 100%. So, so basically you're looking at reputation, aren't you really, so reputation
2426480	2432400	is built over time, okay, so the boutique firm, firm might be newer, so it's slightly more risky,
2432400	2437120	I guess, but so you do your research, you talk to the people, pick up the phone, talk to people,
2437120	2441840	look at the website, pick up the phone, have meetings with the people, maybe four or five
2441840	2446880	firms, maybe, you know, two or three big ones, and two or three small boutiques, and then make
2446880	2452480	your decision, right, I think that's the way people do anything, buying a car, hiring a consultant,
2452480	2458000	so it's no different there, yeah, boutique firms might have more deeper knowledge than some of
2458000	2463520	the bigger guys, actually, that's my, sure, yeah, I think that makes sense, so now let's, let's talk
2463520	2470400	about, we'll dig a bit further into talent, so now not really consulting firms, so suppose
2470400	2477520	if you want to hire your next hire in your consulting firm, an AI talent, what are some
2477520	2481920	of the things that you would look for in that candidate, and what are some of the things that
2481920	2488400	you would not look for in a candidate? Yeah, technically, first of all, you know, you got to
2488400	2493200	know your staff, if it's a technical role, if it's a more of a product manager role, it'd be
2493840	2498480	selling ability and presentation skills more, but for technical roles, yeah, you got to know,
2498480	2504560	you have to have some hands-on on some of the frameworks like MXNet, TensorFlow, and demonstrable
2504560	2511520	hands-on, maybe a GitHub account, for example, with some neural network work on display, okay,
2511520	2517200	and it's, you know, not just from yesterday, but from six to 12 months ago, so yeah, maybe you've
2517200	2521840	worked in a company already, a startup, or a major company, and you're looking for your next move,
2521840	2526160	so it's all demonstrable, and then, you know, just the interviewing process itself,
2527680	2531120	it's just a new technology, again, same process, different technology.
2532720	2537680	So, so you're suggesting that they should have some hands-on on the frameworks that are out there
2537680	2544320	today, and they should be able to demonstrate sort of their comfort level in these platforms,
2544320	2549360	because I think you may not, so I think that's another question, so how different are these
2549360	2555360	frameworks from each other, so if I say no TensorFlow, is it, do I know Keras or MXNet,
2555360	2562240	like, do I know other platforms, or like, how different, how polar are these platforms from
2562240	2567200	each other? Yeah, that's a great question, so yes and no, so the underlying technology, the
2567280	2573280	layers and the nodes, and in the optimization algorithms, the regularization is dropout,
2573280	2579360	there's all these techniques and methodologies that people in the industry know and know about,
2579360	2584720	okay, so how TensorFlow implements that, or MXNet or CNTK, it's going to be in there, okay,
2584720	2589520	it's going to be three lines of code, which will be slightly different in each, you know,
2589520	2594160	framework, okay, but it's more important to know about the optimization algorithm,
2594160	2597520	it's more important to know about the algorithms in fact, we shall be honest, okay,
2597520	2602640	and then the coding is, oh it might be done in Python, Torch, well it's going to be done in Lua,
2602640	2608800	C++, it's TensorFlow, it's going to be done in Python, MXNet can do it in R and Julia and Python
2608800	2614720	and C++, it has the most different languages, that's one reason people choose MXNet actually,
2614720	2619920	so the language as a programmer yourself, we know we can pick out Python or C++ or Ruby if we have
2619920	2624720	to, so it's more a deep understanding of the algorithms and being able to understand why
2624720	2632640	I would use this algorithm. Interesting, I think valid point, so now let's
2633280	2639440	spend a few minutes on chatbots, that's a massive craze nowadays, I think it's almost like,
2640720	2644960	I would say about half of the companies that I hear about nowadays in AI,
2644960	2650880	they're doing some other version of chatbot, so how is how real or unreal is this phenomena
2651600	2656880	and if you can shed some light on that? Yeah absolutely, so chatbots are in LP remember,
2656880	2660240	they're recurrent rule, they work, so that's straight into the technical side of things, so
2661440	2669360	yeah, so chatbots for me, in LP are images, so language, if we as, what makes us unique as humans,
2669360	2674080	one of the major things is our understanding of language, so chatbots are going to be,
2675200	2679440	they are the killer app, there's no doubt about this, in my mind, because if you understand
2679440	2684400	language, you have human level intelligence, you can plan, you can reason, you can communicate and
2684400	2690800	talk intelligently, so when Siri, I can ask Siri, what time's the next bus, where can I
2690800	2696960	order a pizza, what's on at the movies, tell me about the meaning of live, tell me about the
2696960	2703920	subplot of Macbeth, etc., to understand, not just go out to Wikipedia, cut and paste, but to
2703920	2711040	understand, and that's the point we're actually at right now, so yeah, chatbots, they are AI, right?
2711920	2719440	Interesting, and what's, to your perspective, what's next, like what is, so five years, what
2719440	2723760	would be your prophecy for say, one year down the line, five year and ten year down the line,
2724080	2729440	what are some of three things that you would anticipate seeing in next year, in next five
2729440	2737360	and in next ten years? Okay, yeah, great question, so yeah, brave new, utopia, right? Yes, nothing
2737360	2744400	less, nothing less, okay, so yes, it all goes wrong, I see a world in ten years time where,
2744400	2749840	you know, automation is 50% of, you know, people are out of work and enjoying their lives much,
2749840	2754800	much more than they are now, doing jobs, they're not particularly, you know, and thinking that, oh
2754800	2759600	yeah, I used to, looking back and laughing quaintly to themselves, oh, I used to derive meaning out of
2759600	2764480	that job, you know, and, you know, there's a lot more to life than that, so that's the vision,
2764480	2771040	that's utopia, that's where we want, okay, there's dystopia, most of science fiction movies, Terminator,
2771040	2775600	are all about, you know, the bad effects, oh, they're gonna go rogue and turn on us,
2775680	2780640	okay, we'll leave that to one side, I have a Facebook group called AI Safety, which looks into
2781280	2788000	research work, Stuart Russell at Berkeley has just written a book, Do the Right Thing, just
2788000	2792080	published on Amazon, I just found out about it today, in fact, and I put it straight on my AI Safety.
2794000	2798000	Now, he wrote the book on artificial intelligence, mine, okay, him and Peter Norvig at Google,
2798640	2802960	wrote the book on artificial intelligence, A Modern Approach, which everybody uses, okay,
2802960	2806720	so it's no small matter, he's just published this book on AI Safety, okay,
2807840	2813360	trying to downplay all the doomsaing bits that we get from movies and kind of gets ingrained here
2813360	2817600	as kids, and it's kind of hard to remove, okay, he's like, okay, so, you know, here are the theoretical
2817600	2823200	limits on AI, this is what they can do, this is what they certainly cannot do, so don't be afraid,
2823200	2828960	because there are limits on this stuff, okay, there are limits, I'm a physicist by training,
2829040	2834240	the laws of physics constrain stuff, okay, things are constrained, they just don't go, you know,
2834240	2838720	so, yeah, this is a bit of a problem right now, the fear of the unknown, okay, so,
2839280	2844800	10 years, I want to see utopia, I want to see basic income, I want to see people get deriving
2844800	2849920	more meaning out of their life than just going to empty jobs, okay, capitalism has definitely
2849920	2856720	got us to where we are, I'm not anti-capitalist, I'm pro, but, you know, I'm also pro-reality as
2856720	2860800	well, things are changing, let's embrace the change, let's embrace the change.
2862080	2867840	Interesting, so I think one area that I definitely want to touch slightly on before we part ways,
2867840	2873680	I think I would love to know your perspective on some of the use cases in which AI sucks,
2874880	2878800	whoa, some of the use cases in which AI is not efficient.
2878800	2884000	Oh, none really, none, no, because what the big picture here, I think that you're missing is that
2884640	2891280	these artificial, they're basically replacing our neural networks, they're not replacing us
2891280	2899200	as human beings, okay, but they're replacing our neural networks, okay, and that's not scary,
2899200	2903360	for me that's a good thing, because we'll be able to free up and do stuff, creative stuff,
2903360	2911040	okay, so that's basically, so nothing sucks, okay, you know, we had jeopardy, we had chess,
2911040	2916080	we had jeopardy, we had go, and now we're having them beating poker, okay, Carnegie Mellon recently
2916080	2921200	beating poker, one by one, they're beating us at everything they shall, so don't ever think that,
2921200	2926320	oh, they sucked, they're never going to work, it's just not true, okay, things fail, right,
2926320	2935040	experimentation, you know, taking risks, you know, people who take risks do so because they have to,
2935040	2940720	okay, Richard Branson, Larry Page, Bill Gates, they have to entrepreneur Steve Jobs,
2941280	2946880	he didn't have to do the iPhone, but he had to, you know, something in him had to do that, okay,
2946880	2953680	it's the same with AI, you know, we can't stop it, the researchers, mistakes are going to happen,
2953680	2960960	but so what, in any, any take, but I think so, I think you raised a very good point, so one
2961040	2965760	area that you suggested was, okay, so now AI is taking away three, so that we'll get more time to
2965760	2973440	do arts, so now for something like art, do you think AI can do art? Yeah, that's a great point,
2973440	2978880	okay, so the bit I skimmed over was that we are still going to be here as humans, us, we're whole,
2978880	2982720	you know, we have a certain amount of intelligence, there are eight, nine different types of intelligence,
2982720	2990000	there's rational math, okay, logic, that's one, but only one, there's eight more, there's creativity,
2990000	2995920	you just mentioned, painter, music, writing, okay, there's language, there's social interaction,
2996720	3001920	there's introspection, right, that's a form of intelligence, understanding ourselves,
3001920	3005360	understanding our environment, understanding others, those are three types of intelligence,
3006480	3010320	there are others as well, there's commercial business intelligence, you know, we're not all
3010320	3014400	Bill Gates, okay, I haven't got 90 billion because he's better at it than I am, okay,
3014880	3020560	and you have to admit it, Einstein was better at physics than I am, okay, so there's all these
3020560	3026960	different types of intelligence, we will still be us with our, we're starting to understand
3026960	3031520	by developing AI and getting thrashed at chess and go and being humbled completely,
3031520	3036720	right, by these AI neural networks, that yeah, we're limited now, we used to be the center of
3036720	3042480	the universe, Galileo displays that, oh wait, no, we go around the sun through careful observation,
3042560	3047920	and then, you know, slowly but slowly our egos are being brought down to size, it's like, you know
3047920	3052560	what, we're the best that biology can do is intelligence on this planet, but there's probably
3052560	3056960	many other planets out there, okay, as a physicist again, cosmology is a big part of my,
3056960	3064240	right, but I think that's a very good point, and I think last month I was talking to one of the
3064240	3071600	executives, and the conversation went into this idea of, so this is my theory of what's happening,
3071680	3076160	right, so I'll give you a quick bit, so I was, I was, I was pitching this guy, there are two
3076160	3081840	things, there's art of doing business, and there's this science of doing business, right, so science
3081840	3089280	and art working together makes a business, right, so my pitch to them was that the computational
3089280	3095760	part is the science, science is predictable, right, science, science is formulative, science is
3095840	3102560	something that, that sort of can, so, but the art, art is you, art is a bunch of people working
3102560	3106880	together to create an outcome, right, those, those phenomenas, it's, it's a very sort of
3106880	3114480	non-calculative, very qualitative phenomena, in many aspects, so the discussion went into the,
3114480	3120960	the side of that, if, so the technology like AI, right, they push the limit, so they say
3121040	3127280	they're doing such a beautiful job at science, somehow we are confusing them with art, right,
3127280	3135040	so now imagine a business that says, okay, I will do less and less art, because science to me is
3135040	3141120	almost like an art, right, and then with the next upgrade, your entire core competency washed away,
3141120	3146160	right, because your core competency is based out of a partly of art and a partly of science,
3147040	3152320	so what's, what's your thinking, what's, what's, what's your thought on, on that phenomenon?
3152320	3156720	Yeah, okay, so we're at now as we've kind of solved all these narrow intelligence, we've,
3156720	3161040	we've beat chess, we've beat go, we do a lot, we've image classified images more accurately than the
3161040	3166080	human being can, amazingly, okay, it's taken most people by storm, including Sergey Brin who said,
3166080	3172320	I never saw this coming, right, you know, so yeah, if we can take him by surprise,
3172320	3177120	it can take everyone by surprise, I guess, but it's taken me by surprise, it's happened very
3177120	3184880	quickly, and Google DeepMind in London is 350 PhDs in physics and neuroscience and computer
3184880	3190240	science and language. That's, that's, I think that's a fascinating, so thank you so much again,
3190240	3195200	Peter, I think before we part off, I would love to have you have a closing statement on that, so
3195200	3201360	yeah, okay, okay, yeah, so let me just go back to age, I didn't say that the key goal now is to
3201840	3206080	develop general intelligence, which have the, what you mentioned and all of the ones I mentioned,
3206080	3211760	introspect, ability to introspect itself, ability to communicate, understand other people,
3211760	3218640	emotional intelligence, there's people at working at MIT on exactly that, and so this general
3218640	3224080	intelligence is not solved, we have bits and pieces, we need to either come up with a more
3224080	3228880	underlying theory of intelligence, which might come from understanding how the brain works more,
3228880	3233440	in other words, through observation, if I'm right, exactly how the neurons all work,
3233440	3237840	the different types of neurons, and then replicate that, which is a little bit what artificial
3237840	3245600	neural networks do, they're replicating the, basically, how the biological neuron does it
3245600	3252000	integrate and fire, actually, so that's where we're at, we're very good at certain types of tasks,
3252000	3259040	and we want to make it general, we want, we want an iPhone that can, a AI that can drive a car,
3260720	3266400	talk to you emotionally, intelligently, just like having a passenger beside us, okay, we want
3266400	3270800	to build that, but it'll be smarter, faster, and quicker, okay, science fiction, no, not really,
3270800	3275200	we've had so many developments that we can forget about science fiction, it's going to happen,
3275200	3280560	whether it's 5, 10, we don't know exactly, and it will keep improving on the S-curve, Ray Kurzweil
3280560	3287680	talks about the singularity is near, right, that's when we do get AI, EGI, so that's it, that's the
3287680	3293520	goal, that's what I get out of bed in the morning for, is to push that board and companies, and then
3293520	3300000	just keep putting in the latest algorithms and TensorFlow, okay, and other learning frameworks,
3300000	3307200	but ultimately, you know, bits are being added to make them more general, so that's exciting,
3307440	3312400	and that keeps me going, they call us the fourth industrial revolution, I'm happy to be a part
3312400	3317840	of it. Thank you so much, Peter, I think we won't have been said any better, so, and again,
3317840	3323680	I do truly appreciate you sharing your wisdom, I think a couple of things that we learned from
3323680	3330160	the conversation is, study, everything is out there, they are good courses, if you want to equip
3330160	3335440	yourself, what's going on, if you need to hire some consulting, do some due diligence on them,
3336080	3342080	and definitely, thanks to a very vibrant open source community, almost every framework out
