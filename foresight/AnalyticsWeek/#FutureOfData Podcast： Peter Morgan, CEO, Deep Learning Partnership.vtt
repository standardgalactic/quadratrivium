Welcome to future data podcast. In this episode, we'll talk to Peter Morgan around AI machine

00:14.040 --> 00:29.880
learning and deep learning. So stay tuned.

00:29.880 --> 00:36.400
So welcome everyone to future of data podcast. Today we have with us Peter Morgan. He is

00:36.400 --> 00:44.880
with deep learning partnerships along the line of one of the very crucial area artificial

00:44.880 --> 00:50.840
intelligence. We would learn today some of the fun stuff what the AI is what deep learning

00:50.840 --> 00:59.640
is and Peter, thank you so much. I truly appreciate you stepping up and helping and helping our

00:59.640 --> 01:04.360
audience understand what deep learning is what AI is. So why don't we start with your

01:04.360 --> 01:10.720
introduction. I saw that you have a physics major and so you have a scientist from physics

01:10.720 --> 01:14.680
background. What are you doing in AI? So love to know that journey.

01:14.680 --> 01:20.200
Yeah, that's good. That's a good journey to describe try to describe right connected

01:20.200 --> 01:26.160
thoughts. So I did start my life as you know, very interested in science, it was curiosity

01:26.160 --> 01:31.680
I guess and how things work. And I guess that's carried on into AI. You know, how does the

01:31.720 --> 01:37.680
brain work, right? How does intelligence work? So that underlying sense, I think I'm not

01:37.680 --> 01:41.560
doing anything different really, I'm just exploring stuff that I like to explore. I've

01:41.560 --> 01:45.920
been lucky in life in that way. I've just kept exploring where my passion is taking

01:45.920 --> 01:49.840
me and my passion is taking me definitely into AI today. And I have been working in

01:49.840 --> 01:55.680
it for four years. But yeah, just to go back, I did do I was working on a PhD in physics

01:55.840 --> 02:02.960
at University of Massachusetts at Amherst and here in particular theoretical particle physics.

02:02.960 --> 02:08.560
So a lot of math, right? So that helps me actually in AI because you know, it's quite

02:08.560 --> 02:15.440
mathematical. You know, there's two types of AI just like any any subject is theoretical AI and

02:15.440 --> 02:21.440
it is practical. Let's build it AI. Okay. So, you know, I am interested in the theoretical

02:21.440 --> 02:26.400
and the pinnings of you know, how it all works. So, you know, mathematically, it's good, I can

02:26.400 --> 02:32.560
do the math essentially, because of my strong physics background, physics and math. But yeah,

02:32.560 --> 02:37.200
businesses want to apply this stuff too. And I do have a consulting company, which you mentioned

02:37.200 --> 02:42.560
deep learning partnership. So yeah, the hands on is something as well. That's the other side

02:42.560 --> 02:48.960
that I need to be able to, you know, bring to the table. Yeah. Interesting. So thank you for

02:48.960 --> 02:55.760
the quick introduction. So I think one of the one of a good friend of ours, he suggested that if you

02:55.760 --> 03:01.120
want the best data scientist, look for particle physicists, because they pretty much spend their

03:01.120 --> 03:06.800
time looking for the tiny, tiny sort of be tiny sort of the hiccups. Yeah, that's, that's where

03:06.800 --> 03:12.240
most of the anomalies are. And you want sort of professionals who are very focused on in finding

03:12.240 --> 03:17.040
those sort of anomalies, because that's where that's where the big, big opportunities are.

03:17.040 --> 03:21.440
Yeah, I think so. And it's such a new field developing rapidly, there's a lot of stuff

03:21.440 --> 03:25.440
still to be discovered, actually. So yeah, it is nice, nice area to be in.

03:25.440 --> 03:31.600
Nice. So tell me about deep learning. Like, what do you guys do from the talent of it?

03:31.600 --> 03:35.680
Like, what do we have enough to know what deep learning partnership is all about?

03:36.240 --> 03:41.200
Yeah, so that's a company I founded actually about 18 months ago in London, I've just been

03:41.200 --> 03:48.880
over to the US. So I'm a consulting company. And I hire people and as and when, you know,

03:48.880 --> 03:55.520
we get engagement. So most recently, I've been helping to develop a AI bootcamp deep learning

03:55.520 --> 04:00.640
bootcamp in New York City. And it was the first of its kind in the world. So there's a lot of

04:00.640 --> 04:05.760
data science boot camps, which I actually helped out one here in London develop as well. So this

04:05.760 --> 04:11.840
is taking it to the next stage, which is, you know, AI bootcamp deep learning. And already

04:11.840 --> 04:17.040
that we're seeing our competitors, other data science companies starting to offer, you know,

04:17.040 --> 04:23.280
eight week, 12 week deep learning courses. So we're nicely ahead of the curve, you know, I can,

04:24.320 --> 04:30.560
you know, so I can kind of, you know, feel a little bit happy that, you know, I predicted

04:30.640 --> 04:36.400
something that looks like it will happen, you know, so and then we're also doing consulting

04:36.400 --> 04:43.840
engagement into companies as well, like bank banking, retail healthcare. So that's, yeah,

04:43.840 --> 04:50.160
so it's a young company, you know, when work comes along, you know, I try to try to accept it and

04:50.160 --> 04:56.560
bring people on board to help me if we need extra people. So but in general, the market itself is

04:56.560 --> 05:02.160
big and getting bigger exponentially. So I think we're well placed to, you know, continue training

05:02.160 --> 05:07.680
and consulting in this marketplace deep learning. Interesting. So I have a question definitely.

05:07.680 --> 05:12.240
So why deep learning particularly? So there's a machine learning has a lot of other areas.

05:13.200 --> 05:18.480
What brings you to deep learning? That's a good question, Vishal. So deep learning really is

05:18.480 --> 05:22.880
state of the art. And it's the one that's outperforming the other algorithms. I might even

05:22.880 --> 05:28.960
call it good old fashioned AI, machine learning. And machine learning included, you know, random

05:28.960 --> 05:34.800
forests, all the Kaggle winners support vector machine just straying out some technical jargon

05:34.800 --> 05:39.600
here, you know, names of algorithms, well known algorithms that have been very successful for

05:39.600 --> 05:45.520
the last, you know, 30 years or even more some in some cases. So why deep learning and why now?

05:45.520 --> 05:50.560
So these algorithms have been around since the 70s and maybe even earlier, some of the

05:51.200 --> 05:58.320
rudimentary ones, 50s even, even 40s, I think, you know, McCulloch and Pitts wrote down, you know,

05:58.320 --> 06:03.040
how an artificial neural, how the mathematics behind how a neuron works, right? And so

06:03.040 --> 06:08.560
these are artificial neural networks. So it's the same math. So why now, you know, well, basically

06:08.560 --> 06:15.120
it's a hardware and data play. So the hardware we have all the Nvidia GPUs with 8000 cores,

06:15.120 --> 06:20.400
etc. 100 teraflops, you can buy a server, put it under your desk, 100 teraflops. They used to

06:20.400 --> 06:25.120
be a supercomputer 10 years ago. So we have the hardware now, we have the hardware. So now we

06:25.120 --> 06:31.440
can throw the data, we also have the big data sets. So we have ImageNet and other million or

06:31.440 --> 06:36.400
more greater labeled data sets. So we have the data, we have the hardware, we've always had the

06:36.400 --> 06:41.600
algorithm. So we're just putting all three together in the perfect storm. And it turns out that neural

06:41.600 --> 06:47.120
networks outperform all the other algorithms. And why is that? Well, there's something called the

06:47.120 --> 06:55.680
universal approximation theorem, which says that a single layer neural network can approximate

06:55.680 --> 07:01.360
any function to any degree of accuracy. Now, that's a very, very powerful statement. And it is

07:01.360 --> 07:07.280
provable. And it was proven in the 80s by a couple of different teams. And so that's why, okay, that

07:07.280 --> 07:13.200
may sound a little technical. But basically, nature's had 4.5 billion years to trial, try everything,

07:13.280 --> 07:18.160
right? And biology and the laws of physics are such that, you know, and the universal

07:18.160 --> 07:24.000
approximation theorem is the mathematical, you know, statement behind it all says, here's the

07:24.000 --> 07:29.200
most efficient and effective way of processing information. Because at the end of the day,

07:29.200 --> 07:32.720
this is all about processing information, isn't it? Whether it's business information,

07:32.720 --> 07:38.000
science information, or any type of, you know, Facebook information, social media, any type

07:38.000 --> 07:42.480
of information. It just turns out that neural networks are the most accurate and efficient

07:42.480 --> 07:47.200
way of doing that. And biology is clever, right? It's tried everything trial and error, it's had

07:47.200 --> 07:52.560
failures, it's had successes, we've had Einstein, we've had people who aren't clever criminals,

07:52.560 --> 07:59.520
etc. But ultimately, neural networks are the, you know, the most effective way of information,

07:59.520 --> 08:04.720
processing information. And that's deep and very fundamental. And I don't hear many people talking

08:04.720 --> 08:08.720
about it, in fact, but really, that that should be the starting point for any discussion.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.680
That's definitely a very interesting perspective. I've been a big fan of neural

08:13.680 --> 08:19.680
networks, at least from my graduation days. So I've not heard about it since then. But yeah,

08:19.680 --> 08:26.160
I think that I have another friend in neural network space for me. So let's talk about deep

08:26.160 --> 08:30.640
learning. So what, like for our audience, if you can shed some light on what is deep learning?

08:30.640 --> 08:37.280
Yeah, so it's basically another name for artificial neural networks, okay, and I like it

08:37.280 --> 08:40.720
because it's it's easier to say than artificial neural network. So, you know, it's

08:42.320 --> 08:49.440
so the deep part just means it's more than one layer. So, you know, two plus 100 1000 layers,

08:49.440 --> 08:53.760
that's the deep part, you have many, many hidden layers in your neural networks, you have an input

08:53.760 --> 08:59.200
layer and an output layer, and then one or more in the middle. And if it's more than one layer,

08:59.200 --> 09:04.640
remember, the universal approximation theorem says you only need one layer. But the more layers

09:04.640 --> 09:10.800
you have, you know, the quicker it will converge. So, and there's a lot of trade off, no one knows

09:10.800 --> 09:15.440
exactly the right configuration for any particular data set. So there's a this is where all the

09:16.560 --> 09:23.120
room for success really, in scientifically and in business lies, that's a great opportunity

09:23.120 --> 09:26.960
right there. That's a challenge, but also an opportunity for businesses, if they can come

09:26.960 --> 09:31.840
up with a neural network architecture, the number of layers and a number of nodes in each layer,

09:31.840 --> 09:36.400
that is more ideal than your competitor, then you're going to be able to process your data

09:36.400 --> 09:40.320
quicker and more accurately. And that's your competitive edge right there. This field is

09:40.320 --> 09:44.480
changing very quickly. There's a lot of teams on this right now in science and in industry,

09:44.480 --> 09:52.080
like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu, IBM. So, every day papers are coming out on archive,

09:52.080 --> 09:57.280
you know, it's very exciting for me as a scientist actually here in business as well,

09:57.280 --> 10:03.840
moving very rapidly. Interesting. And so, I think, so let's talk about one of the use case. So,

10:03.840 --> 10:08.560
if you can sort of make it very, very sort of simple down to maybe for a five-year-old level,

10:08.560 --> 10:16.000
right? So, what is deep learning as seen by, say, a typical use case? So, to help help me

10:16.000 --> 10:20.640
and our audience understand what is deep learning, that would be helpful. Sure. So, we can split it

10:20.640 --> 10:25.520
into two things. One is image processing and one is language processing, if you like. So,

10:25.600 --> 10:30.960
if our data set consists of images, then we would use something called CNNs or convolutional

10:30.960 --> 10:35.440
neural networks and the other type of neural networks called RNNs or recurrent neural networks,

10:35.440 --> 10:40.240
they're used to process language information, whether that's speech or text, okay? In fact,

10:40.240 --> 10:46.080
any time series, whereas video stream, market data, text or speech, RNNs. So, RNNs are perhaps

10:46.720 --> 10:51.280
the more complicated because they're having to deal with the time series element, they have an

10:51.280 --> 10:58.320
extra time element. CNNs are pretty much a solved technology, if you like, because they're processing

10:58.320 --> 11:03.920
pixels and stationary images. So, whatever use case you can think for a company who wants to

11:03.920 --> 11:12.000
develop and get value out of processing images or processing text, speech, market data, now,

11:12.000 --> 11:17.600
that's any company in any vertical, it's basically unlimited, right? So, any use case you can think

11:17.760 --> 11:21.600
of, I mentioned market data, so algorithmic traders on Wall Street are now using neural

11:21.600 --> 11:29.520
networks to get the high-frequency trading advantage. Healthcare is a great one for me

11:29.520 --> 11:34.080
because it's saving lives and curing cancer and helping us to live longer and better quality

11:34.080 --> 11:42.720
lives. So, for example, radiology, FMRI scans, X-ray scans, these are images, right? And so,

11:42.800 --> 11:48.000
you have a thousand images or a million, you can scan these very quickly using CNNs, okay?

11:48.000 --> 11:54.160
And they can now do that more accurately and faster than any human radiologist who get paid

11:54.160 --> 12:01.520
for $500,000 a year. And so, obviously, hospitals, so there's a lot of jobs in danger right now.

12:01.520 --> 12:05.520
We talk about technological unemployment and these are high white collar jobs too,

12:05.520 --> 12:11.120
not just robots and factory jobs, but yeah. So, that's a side issue, isn't it? We're getting

12:11.120 --> 12:18.080
away from technology, but this has great social and political and economic ramifications that the

12:18.080 --> 12:24.000
fact that these neural networks are going to replace our neural networks. Yeah, no, I think

12:24.000 --> 12:29.600
that's well said. And in fact, I was having a conversation with one of the, I think he was

12:30.320 --> 12:35.680
one of the executive friends and we had this conversation on that. I was reading an article

12:35.680 --> 12:44.960
that the easiest job to replace by an AI is CEOs. So, that's like, so yeah, so I think that's why

12:44.960 --> 12:50.800
and they are the, they are the one who paid the most in this equation. So, definitely,

12:52.800 --> 12:59.920
it's funny how will and when will sort of, I'll have an AI boss. In fact, I do, like in my company,

12:59.920 --> 13:08.240
there's something called Tau. It's a talent, it's an AI around career coaching. So, Tau is

13:08.240 --> 13:17.520
in my boss. So, I'm kind of, so I think it'll be a fun drive to see how creepy or how cool that boss is.

13:17.520 --> 13:21.920
Yeah, exactly. So, and then it brings up, so what are we going to do now that we're displaced for the

13:21.920 --> 13:26.640
first time in history, right? We've had blue collar displacement through the industrial revolution

13:26.640 --> 13:30.880
and PCs, right? But now, it's really, we're going to be able to replace everybody now,

13:30.880 --> 13:36.080
including white collar CEOs, lawyers, doctors, everybody will be replaced eventually.

13:37.280 --> 13:42.640
And it's happening now. So, how are we going to eat and live and survive? So, people are talking

13:42.640 --> 13:47.680
about a universal basic income where the wealth is distributed because the wealth has been concentrated

13:47.680 --> 13:54.640
more and more on a few, right? Google, Facebook, etc. And so, before I used to have IBM and AT&T

13:54.640 --> 13:59.360
with a million, two million employees. And so, they were big companies, but that's,

13:59.360 --> 14:04.480
the wealth was distributed amongst a lot of people. Now, Facebook can kind of have 20,000

14:04.480 --> 14:10.960
employees and be bigger than AT&T and IBM combined. And so, you know, it really is, the inequality is

14:10.960 --> 14:15.760
more than it ever has been in history in moving quicker and quicker. So, yeah, universal basic

14:15.760 --> 14:21.840
income is kind of, which is basically another word for taxation and tax of rich and everything else.

14:21.840 --> 14:27.280
And that really isn't... I think that's a scary slope. Yeah. Yeah, but it's something we have to

14:27.280 --> 14:34.160
face is humanity, right? We do have to, and it's better to face it hit on now than wait, you know,

14:34.160 --> 14:39.840
until it's kind of everybody's starving and in the street and... No, I think that's a very valid

14:39.840 --> 14:48.080
point. And again, I think I'll be pushing my shameless plug here. But I think one of the

14:48.080 --> 14:54.560
things that got us started in AI was the very fact that almost every AI is talking about

14:55.760 --> 15:02.000
sort of shifting jobs or taking away jobs, but there's no AI to actually help save it, right?

15:02.000 --> 15:09.120
So, there's a... So, I think where we are banking on is primarily there's a very broad area emerging

15:09.120 --> 15:14.640
in which what if I'm an AI and I can help you stay employed? So, if suppose I'm seeing a new

15:14.640 --> 15:22.960
trend, and one of the typical use that we give out is that say an example of an autonomous car

15:22.960 --> 15:28.320
phenomena takes a truck driver's job away, right? So, what if we have a network of

15:28.320 --> 15:32.400
a lot of truck drivers and we see one of one of a couple of those guys actually started doing

15:32.400 --> 15:37.840
something called traffic analytics. So, suddenly sort of the network can propagate and say,

15:37.840 --> 15:45.280
hey guys, why don't we all have a secondary or a tertiary career options? And pretty much like

15:45.280 --> 15:51.840
that this AI is anyways, it's your assistant. It keeps grooming you, it keeps giving sort of these

15:51.840 --> 15:57.520
alternate career options. Because I think the whole point of tech displacement is,

15:57.520 --> 16:01.520
so we can free up our time here, so we can focus somewhere else.

16:01.520 --> 16:06.240
Nice. Exactly, yeah. So, we got a question, you know, what is our purpose? What gives us meaning,

16:06.240 --> 16:10.240
right? And so, for a lot of people getting up in the morning going to work, and that's fine too,

16:10.240 --> 16:15.920
but that really won't be there for much longer. So, I'm a real optimist here and that we will

16:15.920 --> 16:19.600
find meaning very easily. It's not something we should worry about, oh my god, we'll never have

16:19.600 --> 16:25.440
meaning without work. I think we replace that with something else. As long as the, you know, we can

16:25.440 --> 16:30.560
eat and have a roof over our heads and have an internet connection, Wi-Fi, right, basic human

16:30.560 --> 16:36.320
right these days, we'll be good. It's a different world, we will get used to it,

16:36.320 --> 16:40.080
but we've had four shifts already. We've had farming, we've had the industrial revolution,

16:40.080 --> 16:45.440
we've had the PC and now the AI, and we've always moved. 98% of people used to work in farms,

16:45.440 --> 16:51.200
now it's one lesson of 2%, okay, everything's automated on farms. So, we've moved comfortably

16:51.200 --> 16:58.400
into industrial factories, and then we've moved comfortably into basically PCs and, you know,

16:58.400 --> 17:03.840
cubicles, and now we're actually going to be free. It's almost like we're taking the chains off,

17:03.840 --> 17:09.840
you know, we need to do what we want. For me, that's great, as long as there's enough that we

17:09.840 --> 17:16.480
can eat, nobody gets left behind. So, I think that's a very noble thought. So, now let's talk

17:16.480 --> 17:22.960
about businesses, right? So, let's sort of try to understand their problem. Say I'm a small business,

17:23.760 --> 17:27.920
why would I care about something called AI, or why would I care about something called

17:27.920 --> 17:34.000
machine learning? What are some of those pitches to those businesses who have,

17:34.640 --> 17:39.200
anyways, no technical know-how, and they've been sort of getting this anxious about this emerging

17:39.200 --> 17:44.560
keyword and jobs getting lost in all that phenomena. Yeah, so, yeah, you know, slightly

17:44.560 --> 17:48.640
flippant is because Google are using it in all of their products and they're the second largest

17:48.720 --> 17:54.240
company in the world. So, yeah, it works, okay? Now, that's it. That's the bottom line, okay?

17:55.280 --> 17:59.840
Facebook too, and all the major tech company, Baidu, IBM, Microsoft, they're all using it.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.920
They're all just replacing everything, all their algorithms, neural networks, okay? So,

18:03.920 --> 18:09.440
if you're not sold on that, you might say, okay, well, that's okay for the big guys with all the tech,

18:09.440 --> 18:13.600
but it's not that because they're using it in every product imaginable. HR,

18:14.080 --> 18:20.880
search, just everything, okay? So, these big tech companies, even though they're tech companies,

18:20.880 --> 18:26.160
they have the same functional units as any company, right? They have HR, they have legal,

18:26.160 --> 18:30.720
they have accounting, they have all of these other departments, okay? So, that's one argument. The

18:30.720 --> 18:36.320
second argument is, okay, so what do you guys do? What's your core competence? Okay, you're in

18:36.400 --> 18:43.360
healthcare, okay? You're a legal company, you're retail, etc., okay? Here's how neural networks are,

18:43.360 --> 18:48.800
not can be, but are being used by other legal companies right now, and medical companies,

18:48.800 --> 18:54.160
and retail companies like Amazon, for example. Here's how, like Jeff Bezos three weeks ago

18:54.160 --> 18:58.640
had an interview where he said, you know, neural networks, AI deep learning, you know,

18:58.640 --> 19:02.640
he actually mentioned those words, you know, straight to the point, we're using them in

19:02.640 --> 19:07.840
everything now, it really is our driver, our key driver at Amazon is deep learning now. So,

19:07.840 --> 19:12.960
Amazon Alexa, Amazon X, so you mentioned these digital assistants, right? Well, that's the

19:12.960 --> 19:18.320
natural language processing I talked about, RNNs. So, we're all going to have one, we kind of have

19:18.320 --> 19:24.640
them now, Siri, Cortana, Google, now, but they'll just get better and better the more data they're

19:24.640 --> 19:30.960
trained on, okay? They're like us as human beings, we were young, we get trained alphabet and numbers

19:30.960 --> 19:37.360
and how to do math and how grammar works, okay? These things are capable of learning and getting

19:37.360 --> 19:43.360
trained, the more data we give to them, whether it's medical data, our own data, so they help us,

19:43.360 --> 19:48.560
or if I'm a healthcare or a retail company, the more data I can feed into it, either from

19:48.560 --> 19:54.240
external sources or internal, the more it can help, the better a job it can do at helping us. So,

19:54.800 --> 19:58.240
I don't know if that's answered your question, I've kept it very general rather than do a very

19:58.240 --> 20:03.520
specific use case, but there are examples in the legal industry, there are companies now who use

20:04.320 --> 20:09.760
neural networks, deep learning is paralegal, so basically quickly scan all the documents much

20:09.760 --> 20:16.480
quicker than any young 20-year-old paralegal can and more accurately too. So, there's an example,

20:16.480 --> 20:21.440
so the natural language processing, the technology's at the point where they can understand, it's

20:21.440 --> 20:26.560
actually natural language understanding, written tech, so any company that uses people to read

20:26.560 --> 20:32.640
and process and make decisions, I mentioned a legal one, can basically replace that process,

20:32.640 --> 20:38.240
human beings with these neural networks, okay? Sounds scary. So, your sales pitch is to these

20:38.240 --> 20:46.640
businesses is that everyone is using it and it's actually showing some real impact in the economic

20:46.640 --> 20:51.680
structure of the businesses and almost all the verticals, as you're saying, are seeing an impact

20:52.640 --> 20:58.720
or at least the incentive of going in this direction, so you should try it out too.

20:58.720 --> 21:04.400
Yeah, but not say that's more of a leap of faith, right? It's more like, and here's how,

21:04.400 --> 21:09.200
here's how these legal companies are using it, here's how Cisco are using it, here's how Amazon

21:09.200 --> 21:13.440
are using it, in real use cases, because this information is public information, the actual

21:14.400 --> 21:18.720
nitty-gritty fine points aren't because that's their competitive advantage, but the general

21:18.800 --> 21:23.920
way, the use cases are definitely, I could Google now, you could too, anybody can, all the listeners,

21:24.480 --> 21:31.360
Google neural networks, legal applications, and there'd be a hundred examples of companies

21:31.360 --> 21:38.480
how they're using it, okay? It's not a secret. Right, interesting, interesting. So, now let's

21:38.480 --> 21:46.560
talk about, I think, I'll go slightly on the technical aspect of deep theoretical AI. I think

21:46.560 --> 21:53.120
one of the so-called drawbacks, or one of the right-handers in using these capabilities is

21:54.240 --> 22:00.320
analysis paralysis, right? Creating the boundaries on where does it really end? When should the

22:00.320 --> 22:05.760
learning begins and where should the learning stops? So, what are some of your thoughts around

22:05.760 --> 22:13.440
those challenges for businesses? So, if I let my AI, in a deep learning case, if it can create,

22:13.520 --> 22:20.960
say, multiple neural network nodes, layers, so then it can actually, it can extrapolate,

22:20.960 --> 22:27.120
and then it can sort of dig deeper than it should, and it can connect two sort of non-related dots,

22:27.120 --> 22:32.000
because somehow we are all connected, but not really from the business sense point of view.

22:32.640 --> 22:36.480
So, how would you, what are some of your thoughts in that direction, if at all?

22:36.480 --> 22:40.480
Yeah, so that's a good question. It's an ongoing area of development. So,

22:40.720 --> 22:46.960
you know, how can I, who's to say that this 100-layer neural network with a million nodes at

22:46.960 --> 22:52.480
each layer, okay, so that's 100 million nodes, which a GPU these days can easily handle, okay?

22:52.480 --> 22:56.880
10 years ago, it would have been, my God, that's going to take us a week to feed out

22:56.880 --> 23:02.640
a million images or whatever text into it. Today, that can be done in half an hour using a new hardware.

23:02.640 --> 23:08.720
So, that's, hardware is not an issue, but so how do I know if it's 99 layers, or 101 layers,

23:08.800 --> 23:13.200
or 100 layers, right? And that's the fair question, and how do I know if it's a million nodes,

23:13.200 --> 23:18.160
or 2 million there, right? We're not really constrained by layers or nodes anymore. Hardware

23:18.160 --> 23:25.120
is good, good to go. So, that is, there's still a little bit, it's more of an art than a science

23:25.120 --> 23:29.200
still. There's a little bit of, you know, magic in there, a little trial and error, not really

23:29.200 --> 23:34.080
magic, but trial and error for sure. You know, the guys at Google, they kind of give you an

23:34.080 --> 23:38.560
answer, right? The guys who write the scientific paper, they've done a lot of exploration that,

23:38.560 --> 23:44.320
you know, we haven't, but they still, it's, it's, wow, you know, here's, here's, here's what we got

23:44.320 --> 23:50.320
by trying different, it's an empirical science at the moment, okay? The underlying theory isn't

23:50.320 --> 23:55.520
solved completely yet, okay? That's, that's the exciting part for me, actually, right?

23:56.880 --> 24:02.400
Interesting, interesting. So, thank you so much for, for shedding, setting your thoughts on,

24:02.480 --> 24:07.280
on that. So, now, let's talk about, again, get back to that, that business thingy, right? So,

24:07.280 --> 24:12.080
I'm a business. So, you told me that, hey, everyone is doing it, you should do it too. There's,

24:12.080 --> 24:17.280
there are some real numbers, real impact. Sure, I'm sold. So, now, what are some of, like,

24:18.560 --> 24:23.680
first three steps that you would suggest to a small business that have no freaking clue?

24:23.680 --> 24:27.840
Yeah. What, that, what AI even means, let alone using it in their business?

24:27.840 --> 24:31.840
Sure, sure. What are some of the things that you can say, hey, maybe do these three things?

24:32.800 --> 24:36.720
Get yourself seen or something. Yeah, well, I think, first of all, education is important.

24:36.720 --> 24:42.480
You know, here's what a, here's what a neural, here's what a deep learning network, AI network,

24:42.480 --> 24:47.440
here's what machine learning means. You know, here's why we are here today. Here's why companies are

24:47.440 --> 24:52.640
using it. And here's where we are, you know, honestly, state of the art. And here's some

24:52.640 --> 24:57.120
examples of how Google have used it or somebody, you know, if they're a law firm, here's some

24:57.120 --> 25:04.000
examples of how, you know, your competitors are using it now and really impacting them.

25:04.000 --> 25:08.800
You know, not, not just they're trying it out. Let's see how they go, really getting results

25:08.800 --> 25:13.120
and have been for the last two or three years. Okay. The stuff hasn't just happened today,

25:13.120 --> 25:19.680
it's been around a while. So, probably five years ago, they call it the big bang, really. So,

25:19.680 --> 25:24.560
it's been around, it's not just starting today. It's, you know, it's, it's not a mature industry,

25:24.560 --> 25:30.800
but there are people who have had these stuff for a good three years, right? So, that's not new.

25:30.800 --> 25:38.880
They use it today, right? So, you're saying education is number one, that you said, like,

25:38.880 --> 25:44.800
educate yourself. What are the other two things that a small business could do to get good?

25:44.800 --> 25:49.040
Yeah. So, that's education. That's number one. That's good. And so, number two, probably then,

25:49.040 --> 25:53.040
obviously, it's the same process. So, new technology, same processes. Some things don't

25:53.520 --> 25:56.400
change. Proof of concept, right? Let's have a little trial. Let's put a,

25:57.360 --> 26:02.560
let's run it on a small cluster, one computer, a small cluster on your laptop, something,

26:02.560 --> 26:08.000
and feed this data set in, this small data set, you know, a subset of your larger data set,

26:08.000 --> 26:12.480
the legal company. Let's just feed it a thousand documents, not a million, right?

26:12.480 --> 26:18.320
And on your laptop, with this neural network, it could be off the shelf open source. Okay. A lot

26:18.320 --> 26:22.800
of this stuff's open source, which is accelerating it. So, it could be TensorFlow. Okay. It could be

26:22.800 --> 26:29.280
MXNet. It could be CNTK. And that's the Google, Amazon, and Microsoft versions in that order,

26:29.280 --> 26:35.280
Facebook use Torch. Okay. So, as a consultant, I should know which one probably is the better

26:35.280 --> 26:40.240
choice for your data set, actually. That's the value that I would add. Okay. Rather than trying

26:40.240 --> 26:44.720
them all one at a time, I could say, actually, well, you know, TensorFlow is probably better choice

26:44.720 --> 26:50.240
than CNTK or Weisweiser, and here's why. Okay. So, that will save you time and money.

26:50.240 --> 26:54.160
But that's a proof of concept. And if it helps, if it works, if you're convinced,

26:55.360 --> 27:00.720
at the results of a small data set running on a small piece of hardware, then we could scale it

27:00.720 --> 27:05.440
up. Let's put all your data in, and let's use a cluster, right? A cluster computing,

27:06.800 --> 27:12.400
you know, not necessarily Hadoop, but the whole, you know, distributed processing cluster,

27:12.400 --> 27:17.120
cluster computing. Let's run it on the cloud. Let's run it on Amazon, if you're happy with that,

27:17.120 --> 27:22.960
or else in your own data center. So, let's scale it up now from one to 100 nodes. Okay.

27:22.960 --> 27:28.880
And let's put all your data set in there, you know. Interesting. Step three. Yeah.

27:28.880 --> 27:35.440
Yeah. I think that that's great. So, get a trial run and then use one of the frameworks.

27:35.440 --> 27:41.680
So, now, I think, and again, I'm taking slight detour. And I think because you peak my interest

27:41.680 --> 27:49.680
around TensorFlow and MXNet and CentOS and Keras, which one is your favorite and which

27:49.680 --> 27:54.160
and why and which was the least favorite and why? Yeah, probably TensorFlow, I like. A number of

27:54.160 --> 28:01.280
users are approaching 50,000 on GitHub, which is the highest ever, you know, even more than Linux.

28:01.280 --> 28:07.440
This is happening so fast, exponential, very steep. So, that's one reason, the popularity.

28:07.440 --> 28:11.440
Second reason, Google's behind it, and they have very good engineers, and people do respect them

28:11.440 --> 28:19.360
for that. Okay. And the third reason is that, you know, looking at these myself, evaluating,

28:19.360 --> 28:23.520
looking at the code and the examples, you know, TensorFlow is good. It's got a good documentation.

28:23.520 --> 28:29.040
Yeah, lots of reasons. Okay. Amazon is, they have good engineers too. So, that's not really a

28:29.040 --> 28:35.280
differentiator. Why not use MXNet? Well, you can actually, it has, it has, there's always pros and

28:35.280 --> 28:41.680
cons. And then CNTK is Microsoft, they have good engineers. And so, you know, why shouldn't I use

28:41.680 --> 28:46.960
my, you know, it depends really, okay. And, you know, rather than get into each and every,

28:46.960 --> 28:53.600
there's probably 12 metrics on each one. And you could draw a matrix, right? All the open source on

28:53.600 --> 29:00.800
on the Y and 12 metrics on the X. And you would have checks in the boxes. And yeah, almost three

29:00.800 --> 29:06.000
dimensional, then you have the application as well, dimension. So, it's complicated. You have to

29:06.000 --> 29:10.960
know your stuff. And that's where the experts come in and make their money, right? Right. So,

29:10.960 --> 29:19.520
now, which one is your least favorite and why? Oh, boy, probably the older ones. I don't know,

29:19.520 --> 29:23.520
you know, they, they, they're all, they've all been good in their time, like Tiano,

29:24.880 --> 29:28.480
Cafe, we're very good in their time because they're kind of the only one, the only game in town.

29:28.480 --> 29:35.360
But now they've been very quickly superseded. When Google announced in November 2015, right,

29:35.360 --> 29:39.120
that they're open sourcing, they're basically their artificial neural network, you know,

29:39.680 --> 29:44.560
the world changed as far as I'm concerned, because then everybody had to open source theirs.

29:44.560 --> 29:48.640
And so that, that really was a big bang. That's a beautiful thing. That's a beautiful thing.

29:48.640 --> 29:52.800
Suddenly, Piano didn't, wasn't as competitive anymore. I'm not saying it's bad. It just,

29:52.880 --> 29:58.560
it just wasn't as competitive. You know, so there's never been a bad software package. It's just,

29:58.560 --> 30:03.520
they get superseded quite quickly. Interesting. Interesting. So now,

30:05.280 --> 30:09.360
now let's talk about, let's, let's talk about the industry as such. I think you, you peak,

30:09.360 --> 30:12.880
you peak my interest around when you talk about these frameworks. And I think you actually

30:12.880 --> 30:17.200
is a very interesting point that most of these vendors now they just came up and they open sourced

30:17.200 --> 30:22.720
it to compete with sort of TensorFlow. So I think that's a beautiful thing. So what are some

30:22.720 --> 30:28.560
of the nice things you're observing in the industry regarding the adoption of AI? So if you

30:28.560 --> 30:33.600
can set some light on that. Yeah, well, for example, it's been very good. It's made everything nice

30:33.600 --> 30:38.080
and competitive and everything out in the open. So, you know, MXNet, they keep upgrading,

30:38.800 --> 30:43.360
CNTK, the Microsoft one that they went from to, they just released version two a couple of months

30:43.360 --> 30:48.320
ago with a heck of a lot more features than they ever would have if Google hadn't have open sourced

30:48.320 --> 30:52.560
TensorFlow. So they've all been, everyone has been forced to a work on it very quickly and

30:52.560 --> 30:57.760
be open sourced it very quickly too. So not everyone just adopts TensorFlow. So if you look

30:57.760 --> 31:04.400
at the GitHub, I think MXNet has got over 10,000, you know, TensorFlow is a clear leader, 50,000,

31:04.960 --> 31:10.160
10,000, CNTK, 10,000, which is quite phenomenal, really. It's like, so people aren't just all

31:10.160 --> 31:16.080
going for TensorFlow. Okay, they are, you know, they are using the other frameworks as well,

31:16.080 --> 31:19.920
whether that's a side-by-side comparison, or we're just going to use it because it's better

31:19.920 --> 31:26.800
for our dataset. We're not sure. But so, yeah, competition is always a good thing. And it really

31:26.800 --> 31:34.560
does move the field quicker. Nice. Yeah. So now, now let's talk about people a bit. So I have heard

31:34.560 --> 31:41.360
about there's a keyword called AI. And I have, I have heard that they have been getting industry's

31:41.360 --> 31:46.240
best salaries out there. So I'm interested in getting myself into AI. So what are some of the

31:46.240 --> 31:51.040
two to three things you would suggest or you would advise me to get me started?

31:51.040 --> 31:58.400
Yeah. So again, I, you know, if you're the CTO, CIO, Chief Data Officer, even CEO in a company or,

31:58.400 --> 32:03.040
you know, the, you know, lead architect, and you've heard about AI and you know that you're

32:03.040 --> 32:06.880
going to be left behind, you need to start reading up on this stuff. And there's a whole bunch of

32:06.880 --> 32:12.640
stuff on the internet, YouTube, beautiful tech tutorials that people have, you know, a love

32:12.640 --> 32:19.680
of labor just put it out there for people. Okay. And the internet, you know, can be underestimated

32:19.680 --> 32:23.440
the impact that the internet is having on all of this technology development. So that's the

32:23.440 --> 32:28.480
platform. People are putting high quality training out there for it. There's no excuse. Okay. It's

32:28.480 --> 32:33.840
very easy to learn. Not so many books out there. It's too new, right? It's just moving so quick

32:33.920 --> 32:39.440
and it's too new. Stamford is open source, same with MIT and Princeton, all the great universities

32:39.440 --> 32:45.920
of the world. Oxford as well have a great course on neural networks, you know, by the

32:45.920 --> 32:52.480
top researcher in the world. Same with Stamford, you know, they offer CNNs and RNNs, two separate

32:52.480 --> 32:57.600
courses. You know, it's just incredible. I mean, this stuff wouldn't have happened 10 years ago

32:57.600 --> 33:02.640
that today. No, I think, I think yes, you are actually raising a very good point that these

33:02.960 --> 33:07.760
so there are a lot of good MOOCs out there. Yeah, I think definitely well said that

33:08.800 --> 33:13.520
guys should check that out. Yeah, just dive in. That's the main thing. Yeah.

33:14.880 --> 33:21.040
Interesting. Interesting. So now, now let's talk about so you said if I'm a business,

33:21.040 --> 33:24.080
I should go I should go and check it out. Now let's

33:26.080 --> 33:31.840
now let's talk about build versus buy versus like what are some of your thoughts on also

33:31.840 --> 33:38.400
if suppose I have no freaking clue what AI is and I've heard and I have seen the impact.

33:39.440 --> 33:44.400
What are some of the things you would suggest for me that should I acquire AI talent or should

33:44.400 --> 33:49.440
I build and grow an AI talent? Yeah, so that's a great question. So really, you want to get,

33:49.440 --> 33:54.320
you know, say let's just use TensorFlow as an example, get your team of architects, you know,

33:54.320 --> 33:58.640
so I made a transition, I was a systems engineer for Google IBM as a consultant,

33:58.640 --> 34:03.280
I've made a transition myself over to AI deep learning so it can be done if you're a techie

34:03.280 --> 34:08.240
kind of minded person and your curiosity will be driving you anyway. I can't imagine there's

34:08.240 --> 34:13.200
any CIOs who haven't, you know, done some MOOC or something, right, because that's why you're in

34:13.200 --> 34:18.960
the business, you know, you love it because of that. And so the second reason is that commercial,

34:18.960 --> 34:25.360
you want your company to succeed, be competitive and to win even, right. So those two are very

34:25.360 --> 34:31.520
strong drivers. So you're just going to basically, so let's say TensorFlow, I've done some reading,

34:31.520 --> 34:36.400
I'm a CIO, a curious guide, I want my business to succeed, I've seen my competitors already

34:36.400 --> 34:41.040
trialing it. Okay, so I'm going to download TensorFlow on my laptop, get some data, get a

34:41.040 --> 34:48.160
data set and try it out. Okay, and then, and then get my team up to speed and three or four of us

34:48.160 --> 34:53.600
and myself will do a little proof of concept. And then if it works, we'll get the visible

34:53.600 --> 34:59.120
show our results to business and give them a business taste, right. And if we get sign off,

34:59.120 --> 35:05.840
we'll scale it. Okay. Now, that's us doing it internally. The other way we could do it is go

35:05.840 --> 35:11.200
get an Accenture or my company or somebody out there consulting to come in and do it for us. Okay,

35:11.200 --> 35:14.960
that's going to be a little more expensive. And at the end, you might not, if something goes wrong,

35:14.960 --> 35:19.200
you know, it's not a you'll have to keep paying the money, right. So ultimately, you want to

35:19.200 --> 35:24.160
gain this knowledge and do it yourself. How you get there is either go to an outside consulting

35:24.160 --> 35:28.640
company or you do it yourself. Probably you might, I don't know, you know, some people,

35:29.200 --> 35:33.040
some engineers are very, very clever. And I know they could do it themselves. Others,

35:33.040 --> 35:37.520
it's not their core competence, you know, they're Walmart, they may sell products, they're not a,

35:37.520 --> 35:42.080
you know, or, you know, a small online retail company with, you know, a single owner,

35:42.640 --> 35:48.160
you know, that they're not a techie person, they want to serve people that that's what gives them

35:48.240 --> 35:52.800
great joy and pleasure, not so much the technical side, they're going to have to get outside help.

35:53.440 --> 36:00.720
That's interesting. I think that's that's a very valid point. So one thing that that we hear a lot

36:00.720 --> 36:07.840
from from many of our clients is the concern that market is crowded. So they're like almost every

36:07.840 --> 36:11.440
so one, I think one executive put it the best, he said, Vishal, you know what,

36:11.440 --> 36:15.360
everyone is trying to sell us, no one is trying to tell us, right. So that's the problem. Okay.

36:15.360 --> 36:22.080
So now, in that scenario, like what are some of some of the, some of the idea suggestions that you

36:22.080 --> 36:27.360
can give to a bunch of these executives, like if I'm recruiting in a consulting firm, or if I'm

36:27.360 --> 36:32.640
recruiting, say, our contractors or whatever, what are some of the things that I should keep in

36:32.640 --> 36:38.560
mind? Or what are some of the hacks or some of the tips or tricks that you would suggest that

36:38.560 --> 36:44.160
these executives should know, so they can hire the best consulting team further for the job.

36:44.160 --> 36:48.640
Yeah. So part of this is being able to sell, right, being a good, you know, part of being a good

36:48.640 --> 36:54.560
leader, a consultant is the ability to sell, basically, and not just sell BS, but, you know,

36:54.560 --> 36:59.760
you know, it's got to be real. So, you know, that's one of the things, you know, in the past life,

36:59.760 --> 37:04.400
my physics, I used to be a teacher, right, so I could teach people new ideas, concepts in the

37:04.400 --> 37:08.640
math and everything behind it. It's no different. I just get in there in front of the executive.

37:08.640 --> 37:13.120
I think this is a wonderful opportunity for me to help improve the world, basically, right,

37:13.120 --> 37:17.120
because we're putting, we're driving stuff forward, automating, making everything more

37:17.120 --> 37:21.600
efficient. So I believe in my cause, okay, that's the number one thing, you know, I have the vision,

37:21.600 --> 37:26.160
I have the belief, and this is a good thing, it's the right thing for humanity, it's the right thing

37:26.160 --> 37:32.720
for business, okay. It's inevitable, a technological unemployment will be worked out, okay. So let's

37:32.720 --> 37:38.320
do the best we can. So from there, then you just, it's a matter of selling in the technology,

37:38.320 --> 37:42.640
here's a neural network, here's what it looks like, here's the architecture, layers, nodes,

37:42.640 --> 37:47.760
here's TensorFlow, here's another one, here's your data set, and here's how, here's your value

37:47.760 --> 37:53.600
proposition, that's it. Right. So I think let me put it this way. So if suppose,

37:54.160 --> 37:58.640
say you are the business, right, and you want to hire a consulting firm to help your business,

37:59.280 --> 38:02.880
so what are like some of two or three sort of things, or what are some of the things that you

38:02.880 --> 38:08.160
would consider when hiring a consulting firm to help you? So what are some of the three, two to

38:08.320 --> 38:12.960
two things that you would consider as an executive to hire for your company?

38:12.960 --> 38:17.280
Yeah, okay, so budget first, okay. If your budget's good, if you're a bigger company,

38:17.280 --> 38:22.080
then you go for quality, right? You say, okay, the Accentures, the McKinsey's,

38:22.080 --> 38:26.160
you know, the Booz Allen Hamilton's, the Deloitte, you know, people with very strong

38:26.160 --> 38:31.120
reputations that they're not strong for, they're strong for a reason, they've been around 100

38:31.120 --> 38:36.880
years or 50 years, and you know, they built that reputation, reputation. So it's like buying a car,

38:36.880 --> 38:42.400
I've got money so I can go get a Rolls Royce or a Lamborghini, right? Actually, I'm budget limited,

38:42.400 --> 38:47.040
so I'm going to, I want the Lamborghini and a Rolls Royce, so I'm going to get a company that

38:47.040 --> 38:52.720
I can have faith in, but I can't afford Accenture right now, you know, in the future, I will be

38:52.720 --> 38:57.760
that, you know, everybody wants to succeed, but right now, you know, so maybe that's where I would

38:57.760 --> 39:05.440
come in, you know, I don't charge the $300 an hour that Accenture might, or however much they,

39:05.440 --> 39:11.840
you know, I don't want to boil this down to that, but it's like, okay, you know, I think I can actually

39:11.840 --> 39:17.200
do a better job maybe than Accenture. So you're suggesting that budget is a concern, so budget

39:17.200 --> 39:21.920
is one concern that you would consider when hiring a consulting firm or a contracting firm,

39:21.920 --> 39:26.720
what are some of the other considerations that you think that someone would think about when

39:26.720 --> 39:32.080
hiring a firm? Yeah, so quality, definitely the quality factor too, okay, so yeah, not every, you

39:32.080 --> 39:35.760
know, if people, the budget and quality are kind of matched, aren't they, if you've got

39:35.760 --> 39:39.760
unlimited budget, you probably should go for the best quality, there's no real reason not to, but

39:39.760 --> 39:49.440
if so, how do, so is there any, is there any kind of reputation index, or is there anything out there

39:49.440 --> 39:55.120
that's supposed, if, how would I know if your firm is any good or better than Accenture? Yeah,

39:55.120 --> 40:01.040
or how, like, are there, like, what are some of the tools that I would know, yeah, that for this

40:01.040 --> 40:08.560
particular job, for a, for an industry like mine, a boutique firm like yours, Vis-A-Vis of Accenture,

40:09.120 --> 40:14.880
like, what are some of, is there anything out there that I can, I can look for, or? Not really,

40:14.880 --> 40:20.640
so reputation is, you'll read, yeah, you should do your due diligence, absolutely, yeah, encourage

40:20.640 --> 40:26.400
that 100%. So, so basically you're looking at reputation, aren't you really, so reputation

40:26.480 --> 40:32.400
is built over time, okay, so the boutique firm, firm might be newer, so it's slightly more risky,

40:32.400 --> 40:37.120
I guess, but so you do your research, you talk to the people, pick up the phone, talk to people,

40:37.120 --> 40:41.840
look at the website, pick up the phone, have meetings with the people, maybe four or five

40:41.840 --> 40:46.880
firms, maybe, you know, two or three big ones, and two or three small boutiques, and then make

40:46.880 --> 40:52.480
your decision, right, I think that's the way people do anything, buying a car, hiring a consultant,

40:52.480 --> 40:58.000
so it's no different there, yeah, boutique firms might have more deeper knowledge than some of

40:58.000 --> 41:03.520
the bigger guys, actually, that's my, sure, yeah, I think that makes sense, so now let's, let's talk

41:03.520 --> 41:10.400
about, we'll dig a bit further into talent, so now not really consulting firms, so suppose

41:10.400 --> 41:17.520
if you want to hire your next hire in your consulting firm, an AI talent, what are some

41:17.520 --> 41:21.920
of the things that you would look for in that candidate, and what are some of the things that

41:21.920 --> 41:28.400
you would not look for in a candidate? Yeah, technically, first of all, you know, you got to

41:28.400 --> 41:33.200
know your staff, if it's a technical role, if it's a more of a product manager role, it'd be

41:33.840 --> 41:38.480
selling ability and presentation skills more, but for technical roles, yeah, you got to know,

41:38.480 --> 41:44.560
you have to have some hands-on on some of the frameworks like MXNet, TensorFlow, and demonstrable

41:44.560 --> 41:51.520
hands-on, maybe a GitHub account, for example, with some neural network work on display, okay,

41:51.520 --> 41:57.200
and it's, you know, not just from yesterday, but from six to 12 months ago, so yeah, maybe you've

41:57.200 --> 42:01.840
worked in a company already, a startup, or a major company, and you're looking for your next move,

42:01.840 --> 42:06.160
so it's all demonstrable, and then, you know, just the interviewing process itself,

42:07.680 --> 42:11.120
it's just a new technology, again, same process, different technology.

42:12.720 --> 42:17.680
So, so you're suggesting that they should have some hands-on on the frameworks that are out there

42:17.680 --> 42:24.320
today, and they should be able to demonstrate sort of their comfort level in these platforms,

42:24.320 --> 42:29.360
because I think you may not, so I think that's another question, so how different are these

42:29.360 --> 42:35.360
frameworks from each other, so if I say no TensorFlow, is it, do I know Keras or MXNet,

42:35.360 --> 42:42.240
like, do I know other platforms, or like, how different, how polar are these platforms from

42:42.240 --> 42:47.200
each other? Yeah, that's a great question, so yes and no, so the underlying technology, the

42:47.280 --> 42:53.280
layers and the nodes, and in the optimization algorithms, the regularization is dropout,

42:53.280 --> 42:59.360
there's all these techniques and methodologies that people in the industry know and know about,

42:59.360 --> 43:04.720
okay, so how TensorFlow implements that, or MXNet or CNTK, it's going to be in there, okay,

43:04.720 --> 43:09.520
it's going to be three lines of code, which will be slightly different in each, you know,

43:09.520 --> 43:14.160
framework, okay, but it's more important to know about the optimization algorithm,

43:14.160 --> 43:17.520
it's more important to know about the algorithms in fact, we shall be honest, okay,

43:17.520 --> 43:22.640
and then the coding is, oh it might be done in Python, Torch, well it's going to be done in Lua,

43:22.640 --> 43:28.800
C++, it's TensorFlow, it's going to be done in Python, MXNet can do it in R and Julia and Python

43:28.800 --> 43:34.720
and C++, it has the most different languages, that's one reason people choose MXNet actually,

43:34.720 --> 43:39.920
so the language as a programmer yourself, we know we can pick out Python or C++ or Ruby if we have

43:39.920 --> 43:44.720
to, so it's more a deep understanding of the algorithms and being able to understand why

43:44.720 --> 43:52.640
I would use this algorithm. Interesting, I think valid point, so now let's

43:53.280 --> 43:59.440
spend a few minutes on chatbots, that's a massive craze nowadays, I think it's almost like,

44:00.720 --> 44:04.960
I would say about half of the companies that I hear about nowadays in AI,

44:04.960 --> 44:10.880
they're doing some other version of chatbot, so how is how real or unreal is this phenomena

44:11.600 --> 44:16.880
and if you can shed some light on that? Yeah absolutely, so chatbots are in LP remember,

44:16.880 --> 44:20.240
they're recurrent rule, they work, so that's straight into the technical side of things, so

44:21.440 --> 44:29.360
yeah, so chatbots for me, in LP are images, so language, if we as, what makes us unique as humans,

44:29.360 --> 44:34.080
one of the major things is our understanding of language, so chatbots are going to be,

44:35.200 --> 44:39.440
they are the killer app, there's no doubt about this, in my mind, because if you understand

44:39.440 --> 44:44.400
language, you have human level intelligence, you can plan, you can reason, you can communicate and

44:44.400 --> 44:50.800
talk intelligently, so when Siri, I can ask Siri, what time's the next bus, where can I

44:50.800 --> 44:56.960
order a pizza, what's on at the movies, tell me about the meaning of live, tell me about the

44:56.960 --> 45:03.920
subplot of Macbeth, etc., to understand, not just go out to Wikipedia, cut and paste, but to

45:03.920 --> 45:11.040
understand, and that's the point we're actually at right now, so yeah, chatbots, they are AI, right?

45:11.920 --> 45:19.440
Interesting, and what's, to your perspective, what's next, like what is, so five years, what

45:19.440 --> 45:23.760
would be your prophecy for say, one year down the line, five year and ten year down the line,

45:24.080 --> 45:29.440
what are some of three things that you would anticipate seeing in next year, in next five

45:29.440 --> 45:37.360
and in next ten years? Okay, yeah, great question, so yeah, brave new, utopia, right? Yes, nothing

45:37.360 --> 45:44.400
less, nothing less, okay, so yes, it all goes wrong, I see a world in ten years time where,

45:44.400 --> 45:49.840
you know, automation is 50% of, you know, people are out of work and enjoying their lives much,

45:49.840 --> 45:54.800
much more than they are now, doing jobs, they're not particularly, you know, and thinking that, oh

45:54.800 --> 45:59.600
yeah, I used to, looking back and laughing quaintly to themselves, oh, I used to derive meaning out of

45:59.600 --> 46:04.480
that job, you know, and, you know, there's a lot more to life than that, so that's the vision,

46:04.480 --> 46:11.040
that's utopia, that's where we want, okay, there's dystopia, most of science fiction movies, Terminator,

46:11.040 --> 46:15.600
are all about, you know, the bad effects, oh, they're gonna go rogue and turn on us,

46:15.680 --> 46:20.640
okay, we'll leave that to one side, I have a Facebook group called AI Safety, which looks into

46:21.280 --> 46:28.000
research work, Stuart Russell at Berkeley has just written a book, Do the Right Thing, just

46:28.000 --> 46:32.080
published on Amazon, I just found out about it today, in fact, and I put it straight on my AI Safety.

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
Now, he wrote the book on artificial intelligence, mine, okay, him and Peter Norvig at Google,

46:38.640 --> 46:42.960
wrote the book on artificial intelligence, A Modern Approach, which everybody uses, okay,

46:42.960 --> 46:46.720
so it's no small matter, he's just published this book on AI Safety, okay,

46:47.840 --> 46:53.360
trying to downplay all the doomsaing bits that we get from movies and kind of gets ingrained here

46:53.360 --> 46:57.600
as kids, and it's kind of hard to remove, okay, he's like, okay, so, you know, here are the theoretical

46:57.600 --> 47:03.200
limits on AI, this is what they can do, this is what they certainly cannot do, so don't be afraid,

47:03.200 --> 47:08.960
because there are limits on this stuff, okay, there are limits, I'm a physicist by training,

47:09.040 --> 47:14.240
the laws of physics constrain stuff, okay, things are constrained, they just don't go, you know,

47:14.240 --> 47:18.720
so, yeah, this is a bit of a problem right now, the fear of the unknown, okay, so,

47:19.280 --> 47:24.800
10 years, I want to see utopia, I want to see basic income, I want to see people get deriving

47:24.800 --> 47:29.920
more meaning out of their life than just going to empty jobs, okay, capitalism has definitely

47:29.920 --> 47:36.720
got us to where we are, I'm not anti-capitalist, I'm pro, but, you know, I'm also pro-reality as

47:36.720 --> 47:40.800
well, things are changing, let's embrace the change, let's embrace the change.

47:42.080 --> 47:47.840
Interesting, so I think one area that I definitely want to touch slightly on before we part ways,

47:47.840 --> 47:53.680
I think I would love to know your perspective on some of the use cases in which AI sucks,

47:54.880 --> 47:58.800
whoa, some of the use cases in which AI is not efficient.

47:58.800 --> 48:04.000
Oh, none really, none, no, because what the big picture here, I think that you're missing is that

48:04.640 --> 48:11.280
these artificial, they're basically replacing our neural networks, they're not replacing us

48:11.280 --> 48:19.200
as human beings, okay, but they're replacing our neural networks, okay, and that's not scary,

48:19.200 --> 48:23.360
for me that's a good thing, because we'll be able to free up and do stuff, creative stuff,

48:23.360 --> 48:31.040
okay, so that's basically, so nothing sucks, okay, you know, we had jeopardy, we had chess,

48:31.040 --> 48:36.080
we had jeopardy, we had go, and now we're having them beating poker, okay, Carnegie Mellon recently

48:36.080 --> 48:41.200
beating poker, one by one, they're beating us at everything they shall, so don't ever think that,

48:41.200 --> 48:46.320
oh, they sucked, they're never going to work, it's just not true, okay, things fail, right,

48:46.320 --> 48:55.040
experimentation, you know, taking risks, you know, people who take risks do so because they have to,

48:55.040 --> 49:00.720
okay, Richard Branson, Larry Page, Bill Gates, they have to entrepreneur Steve Jobs,

49:01.280 --> 49:06.880
he didn't have to do the iPhone, but he had to, you know, something in him had to do that, okay,

49:06.880 --> 49:13.680
it's the same with AI, you know, we can't stop it, the researchers, mistakes are going to happen,

49:13.680 --> 49:20.960
but so what, in any, any take, but I think so, I think you raised a very good point, so one

49:21.040 --> 49:25.760
area that you suggested was, okay, so now AI is taking away three, so that we'll get more time to

49:25.760 --> 49:33.440
do arts, so now for something like art, do you think AI can do art? Yeah, that's a great point,

49:33.440 --> 49:38.880
okay, so the bit I skimmed over was that we are still going to be here as humans, us, we're whole,

49:38.880 --> 49:42.720
you know, we have a certain amount of intelligence, there are eight, nine different types of intelligence,

49:42.720 --> 49:50.000
there's rational math, okay, logic, that's one, but only one, there's eight more, there's creativity,

49:50.000 --> 49:55.920
you just mentioned, painter, music, writing, okay, there's language, there's social interaction,

49:56.720 --> 50:01.920
there's introspection, right, that's a form of intelligence, understanding ourselves,

50:01.920 --> 50:05.360
understanding our environment, understanding others, those are three types of intelligence,

50:06.480 --> 50:10.320
there are others as well, there's commercial business intelligence, you know, we're not all

50:10.320 --> 50:14.400
Bill Gates, okay, I haven't got 90 billion because he's better at it than I am, okay,

50:14.880 --> 50:20.560
and you have to admit it, Einstein was better at physics than I am, okay, so there's all these

50:20.560 --> 50:26.960
different types of intelligence, we will still be us with our, we're starting to understand

50:26.960 --> 50:31.520
by developing AI and getting thrashed at chess and go and being humbled completely,

50:31.520 --> 50:36.720
right, by these AI neural networks, that yeah, we're limited now, we used to be the center of

50:36.720 --> 50:42.480
the universe, Galileo displays that, oh wait, no, we go around the sun through careful observation,

50:42.560 --> 50:47.920
and then, you know, slowly but slowly our egos are being brought down to size, it's like, you know

50:47.920 --> 50:52.560
what, we're the best that biology can do is intelligence on this planet, but there's probably

50:52.560 --> 50:56.960
many other planets out there, okay, as a physicist again, cosmology is a big part of my,

50:56.960 --> 51:04.240
right, but I think that's a very good point, and I think last month I was talking to one of the

51:04.240 --> 51:11.600
executives, and the conversation went into this idea of, so this is my theory of what's happening,

51:11.680 --> 51:16.160
right, so I'll give you a quick bit, so I was, I was, I was pitching this guy, there are two

51:16.160 --> 51:21.840
things, there's art of doing business, and there's this science of doing business, right, so science

51:21.840 --> 51:29.280
and art working together makes a business, right, so my pitch to them was that the computational

51:29.280 --> 51:35.760
part is the science, science is predictable, right, science, science is formulative, science is

51:35.840 --> 51:42.560
something that, that sort of can, so, but the art, art is you, art is a bunch of people working

51:42.560 --> 51:46.880
together to create an outcome, right, those, those phenomenas, it's, it's a very sort of

51:46.880 --> 51:54.480
non-calculative, very qualitative phenomena, in many aspects, so the discussion went into the,

51:54.480 --> 52:00.960
the side of that, if, so the technology like AI, right, they push the limit, so they say

52:01.040 --> 52:07.280
they're doing such a beautiful job at science, somehow we are confusing them with art, right,

52:07.280 --> 52:15.040
so now imagine a business that says, okay, I will do less and less art, because science to me is

52:15.040 --> 52:21.120
almost like an art, right, and then with the next upgrade, your entire core competency washed away,

52:21.120 --> 52:26.160
right, because your core competency is based out of a partly of art and a partly of science,

52:27.040 --> 52:32.320
so what's, what's your thinking, what's, what's, what's your thought on, on that phenomenon?

52:32.320 --> 52:36.720
Yeah, okay, so we're at now as we've kind of solved all these narrow intelligence, we've,

52:36.720 --> 52:41.040
we've beat chess, we've beat go, we do a lot, we've image classified images more accurately than the

52:41.040 --> 52:46.080
human being can, amazingly, okay, it's taken most people by storm, including Sergey Brin who said,

52:46.080 --> 52:52.320
I never saw this coming, right, you know, so yeah, if we can take him by surprise,

52:52.320 --> 52:57.120
it can take everyone by surprise, I guess, but it's taken me by surprise, it's happened very

52:57.120 --> 53:04.880
quickly, and Google DeepMind in London is 350 PhDs in physics and neuroscience and computer

53:04.880 --> 53:10.240
science and language. That's, that's, I think that's a fascinating, so thank you so much again,

53:10.240 --> 53:15.200
Peter, I think before we part off, I would love to have you have a closing statement on that, so

53:15.200 --> 53:21.360
yeah, okay, okay, yeah, so let me just go back to age, I didn't say that the key goal now is to

53:21.840 --> 53:26.080
develop general intelligence, which have the, what you mentioned and all of the ones I mentioned,

53:26.080 --> 53:31.760
introspect, ability to introspect itself, ability to communicate, understand other people,

53:31.760 --> 53:38.640
emotional intelligence, there's people at working at MIT on exactly that, and so this general

53:38.640 --> 53:44.080
intelligence is not solved, we have bits and pieces, we need to either come up with a more

53:44.080 --> 53:48.880
underlying theory of intelligence, which might come from understanding how the brain works more,

53:48.880 --> 53:53.440
in other words, through observation, if I'm right, exactly how the neurons all work,

53:53.440 --> 53:57.840
the different types of neurons, and then replicate that, which is a little bit what artificial

53:57.840 --> 54:05.600
neural networks do, they're replicating the, basically, how the biological neuron does it

54:05.600 --> 54:12.000
integrate and fire, actually, so that's where we're at, we're very good at certain types of tasks,

54:12.000 --> 54:19.040
and we want to make it general, we want, we want an iPhone that can, a AI that can drive a car,

54:20.720 --> 54:26.400
talk to you emotionally, intelligently, just like having a passenger beside us, okay, we want

54:26.400 --> 54:30.800
to build that, but it'll be smarter, faster, and quicker, okay, science fiction, no, not really,

54:30.800 --> 54:35.200
we've had so many developments that we can forget about science fiction, it's going to happen,

54:35.200 --> 54:40.560
whether it's 5, 10, we don't know exactly, and it will keep improving on the S-curve, Ray Kurzweil

54:40.560 --> 54:47.680
talks about the singularity is near, right, that's when we do get AI, EGI, so that's it, that's the

54:47.680 --> 54:53.520
goal, that's what I get out of bed in the morning for, is to push that board and companies, and then

54:53.520 --> 55:00.000
just keep putting in the latest algorithms and TensorFlow, okay, and other learning frameworks,

55:00.000 --> 55:07.200
but ultimately, you know, bits are being added to make them more general, so that's exciting,

55:07.440 --> 55:12.400
and that keeps me going, they call us the fourth industrial revolution, I'm happy to be a part

55:12.400 --> 55:17.840
of it. Thank you so much, Peter, I think we won't have been said any better, so, and again,

55:17.840 --> 55:23.680
I do truly appreciate you sharing your wisdom, I think a couple of things that we learned from

55:23.680 --> 55:30.160
the conversation is, study, everything is out there, they are good courses, if you want to equip

55:30.160 --> 55:35.440
yourself, what's going on, if you need to hire some consulting, do some due diligence on them,

55:36.080 --> 55:42.080
and definitely, thanks to a very vibrant open source community, almost every framework out

55:42.080 --> 55:47.200
there is blessed with a lot of support, and there's no sort of clear winner, they all are sort of

55:47.200 --> 55:54.000
playing their clear role, I think that is really, really helpful to know, and definitely, we wish

55:54.000 --> 56:00.960
you all the luck with your consulting firm, and love to probably have you back sometime and share

56:00.960 --> 56:07.040
your story and success and failures, and share with our audience, and good luck, and thank you so

56:07.040 --> 56:10.880
much for your time. Thank you for having me, yeah, it's been fun, it's been great. Awesome.

56:30.960 --> 56:33.920
this is how I'm breaking down, I hope I'm not up on this
