1. **AI Development**: We've made significant progress in narrow AI applications like beating humans at chess and Go, classifying images more accurately than humans, etc. However, the ultimate goal is to develop General Intelligence (GI) that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can.

2. **General Intelligence**: GI encompasses a wide range of capabilities including introspection, communication, understanding emotions, and more. Efforts are underway at places like MIT to create AI with such general intelligence.

3. **Theoretical Foundations**: A deeper theoretical understanding of intelligence, possibly derived from how the human brain works, is needed to advance GI. This involves studying different types of neurons and how they integrate and fire, which is what artificial neural networks attempt to replicate.

4. **Practical Applications**: The aim is to create AI systems that can perform tasks as seamlessly as having a knowledgeable passenger beside us, such as driving cars or engaging in conversation.

5. **The Future of AI**: We are in the midst of the fourth industrial revolution, and AI development is on an S-curve, with improvements becoming faster and more significant over time. The singularity, a term coined by Ray Kurzweil, represents the point where AI and EGI surpass human intelligence.

6. **Education and Community Support**: There are many courses available for those interested in learning about AI, and the open source community provides robust support for various AI frameworks.

7. **Consulting and Industry**: Professional advice and consulting in AI can be beneficial, especially as businesses look to integrate AI into their operations.

8. **Continued Innovation**: The field of AI is vibrant and rapidly evolving, with new breakthroughs and advancements continually being made.

9. **Personal Reflection**: Peter is passionate about contributing to the development of AI and is focused on pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this space.

In summary, the journey towards General Intelligence in AI is ongoing, with exciting developments happening regularly. The field is interdisciplinary, requiring insights from neuroscience, psychology, computer science, and more. As we advance, AI systems are becoming more versatile and human-like in their capabilities, which will have profound implications for society as a whole.
