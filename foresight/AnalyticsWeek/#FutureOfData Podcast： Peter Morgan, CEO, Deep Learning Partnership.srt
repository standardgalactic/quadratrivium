00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,040
Welcome to future data podcast. In this episode, we'll talk to Peter Morgan around AI machine

2
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:29,880
learning and deep learning. So stay tuned.

3
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,400
So welcome everyone to future of data podcast. Today we have with us Peter Morgan. He is

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:44,880
with deep learning partnerships along the line of one of the very crucial area artificial

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,840
intelligence. We would learn today some of the fun stuff what the AI is what deep learning

6
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:59,640
is and Peter, thank you so much. I truly appreciate you stepping up and helping and helping our

7
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,360
audience understand what deep learning is what AI is. So why don't we start with your

8
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,720
introduction. I saw that you have a physics major and so you have a scientist from physics

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,680
background. What are you doing in AI? So love to know that journey.

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,200
Yeah, that's good. That's a good journey to describe try to describe right connected

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,160
thoughts. So I did start my life as you know, very interested in science, it was curiosity

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,680
I guess and how things work. And I guess that's carried on into AI. You know, how does the

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,680
brain work, right? How does intelligence work? So that underlying sense, I think I'm not

14
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,560
doing anything different really, I'm just exploring stuff that I like to explore. I've

15
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,920
been lucky in life in that way. I've just kept exploring where my passion is taking

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,840
me and my passion is taking me definitely into AI today. And I have been working in

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,680
it for four years. But yeah, just to go back, I did do I was working on a PhD in physics

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,960
at University of Massachusetts at Amherst and here in particular theoretical particle physics.

19
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,560
So a lot of math, right? So that helps me actually in AI because you know, it's quite

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,440
mathematical. You know, there's two types of AI just like any any subject is theoretical AI and

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,440
it is practical. Let's build it AI. Okay. So, you know, I am interested in the theoretical

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,400
and the pinnings of you know, how it all works. So, you know, mathematically, it's good, I can

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,560
do the math essentially, because of my strong physics background, physics and math. But yeah,

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,200
businesses want to apply this stuff too. And I do have a consulting company, which you mentioned

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,560
deep learning partnership. So yeah, the hands on is something as well. That's the other side

26
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,960
that I need to be able to, you know, bring to the table. Yeah. Interesting. So thank you for

27
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,760
the quick introduction. So I think one of the one of a good friend of ours, he suggested that if you

28
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,120
want the best data scientist, look for particle physicists, because they pretty much spend their

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,800
time looking for the tiny, tiny sort of be tiny sort of the hiccups. Yeah, that's, that's where

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,240
most of the anomalies are. And you want sort of professionals who are very focused on in finding

31
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,040
those sort of anomalies, because that's where that's where the big, big opportunities are.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,440
Yeah, I think so. And it's such a new field developing rapidly, there's a lot of stuff

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,440
still to be discovered, actually. So yeah, it is nice, nice area to be in.

34
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,600
Nice. So tell me about deep learning. Like, what do you guys do from the talent of it?

35
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,680
Like, what do we have enough to know what deep learning partnership is all about?

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:41,200
Yeah, so that's a company I founded actually about 18 months ago in London, I've just been

37
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,880
over to the US. So I'm a consulting company. And I hire people and as and when, you know,

38
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:55,520
we get engagement. So most recently, I've been helping to develop a AI bootcamp deep learning

39
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,640
bootcamp in New York City. And it was the first of its kind in the world. So there's a lot of

40
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,760
data science boot camps, which I actually helped out one here in London develop as well. So this

41
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:11,840
is taking it to the next stage, which is, you know, AI bootcamp deep learning. And already

42
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,040
that we're seeing our competitors, other data science companies starting to offer, you know,

43
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,280
eight week, 12 week deep learning courses. So we're nicely ahead of the curve, you know, I can,

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,560
you know, so I can kind of, you know, feel a little bit happy that, you know, I predicted

45
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:36,400
something that looks like it will happen, you know, so and then we're also doing consulting

46
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,840
engagement into companies as well, like bank banking, retail healthcare. So that's, yeah,

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,160
so it's a young company, you know, when work comes along, you know, I try to try to accept it and

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,560
bring people on board to help me if we need extra people. So but in general, the market itself is

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,160
big and getting bigger exponentially. So I think we're well placed to, you know, continue training

50
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,680
and consulting in this marketplace deep learning. Interesting. So I have a question definitely.

51
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,240
So why deep learning particularly? So there's a machine learning has a lot of other areas.

52
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,480
What brings you to deep learning? That's a good question, Vishal. So deep learning really is

53
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,880
state of the art. And it's the one that's outperforming the other algorithms. I might even

54
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,960
call it good old fashioned AI, machine learning. And machine learning included, you know, random

55
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,800
forests, all the Kaggle winners support vector machine just straying out some technical jargon

56
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,600
here, you know, names of algorithms, well known algorithms that have been very successful for

57
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,520
the last, you know, 30 years or even more some in some cases. So why deep learning and why now?

58
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,560
So these algorithms have been around since the 70s and maybe even earlier, some of the

59
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:58,320
rudimentary ones, 50s even, even 40s, I think, you know, McCulloch and Pitts wrote down, you know,

60
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,040
how an artificial neural, how the mathematics behind how a neuron works, right? And so

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,560
these are artificial neural networks. So it's the same math. So why now, you know, well, basically

62
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:15,120
it's a hardware and data play. So the hardware we have all the Nvidia GPUs with 8000 cores,

63
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,400
etc. 100 teraflops, you can buy a server, put it under your desk, 100 teraflops. They used to

64
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,120
be a supercomputer 10 years ago. So we have the hardware now, we have the hardware. So now we

65
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,440
can throw the data, we also have the big data sets. So we have ImageNet and other million or

66
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,400
more greater labeled data sets. So we have the data, we have the hardware, we've always had the

67
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,600
algorithm. So we're just putting all three together in the perfect storm. And it turns out that neural

68
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,120
networks outperform all the other algorithms. And why is that? Well, there's something called the

69
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:55,680
universal approximation theorem, which says that a single layer neural network can approximate

70
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,360
any function to any degree of accuracy. Now, that's a very, very powerful statement. And it is

71
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,280
provable. And it was proven in the 80s by a couple of different teams. And so that's why, okay, that

72
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,200
may sound a little technical. But basically, nature's had 4.5 billion years to trial, try everything,

73
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,160
right? And biology and the laws of physics are such that, you know, and the universal

74
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,000
approximation theorem is the mathematical, you know, statement behind it all says, here's the

75
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,200
most efficient and effective way of processing information. Because at the end of the day,

76
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,720
this is all about processing information, isn't it? Whether it's business information,

77
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,000
science information, or any type of, you know, Facebook information, social media, any type

78
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,480
of information. It just turns out that neural networks are the most accurate and efficient

79
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,200
way of doing that. And biology is clever, right? It's tried everything trial and error, it's had

80
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:52,560
failures, it's had successes, we've had Einstein, we've had people who aren't clever criminals,

81
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,520
etc. But ultimately, neural networks are the, you know, the most effective way of information,

82
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,720
processing information. And that's deep and very fundamental. And I don't hear many people talking

83
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,720
about it, in fact, but really, that that should be the starting point for any discussion.

84
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,680
That's definitely a very interesting perspective. I've been a big fan of neural

85
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,680
networks, at least from my graduation days. So I've not heard about it since then. But yeah,

86
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,160
I think that I have another friend in neural network space for me. So let's talk about deep

87
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,640
learning. So what, like for our audience, if you can shed some light on what is deep learning?

88
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,280
Yeah, so it's basically another name for artificial neural networks, okay, and I like it

89
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,720
because it's it's easier to say than artificial neural network. So, you know, it's

90
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,440
so the deep part just means it's more than one layer. So, you know, two plus 100 1000 layers,

91
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,760
that's the deep part, you have many, many hidden layers in your neural networks, you have an input

92
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,200
layer and an output layer, and then one or more in the middle. And if it's more than one layer,

93
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,640
remember, the universal approximation theorem says you only need one layer. But the more layers

94
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,800
you have, you know, the quicker it will converge. So, and there's a lot of trade off, no one knows

95
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,440
exactly the right configuration for any particular data set. So there's a this is where all the

96
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,120
room for success really, in scientifically and in business lies, that's a great opportunity

97
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,960
right there. That's a challenge, but also an opportunity for businesses, if they can come

98
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,840
up with a neural network architecture, the number of layers and a number of nodes in each layer,

99
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,400
that is more ideal than your competitor, then you're going to be able to process your data

100
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,320
quicker and more accurately. And that's your competitive edge right there. This field is

101
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,480
changing very quickly. There's a lot of teams on this right now in science and in industry,

102
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:52,080
like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Baidu, IBM. So, every day papers are coming out on archive,

103
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,280
you know, it's very exciting for me as a scientist actually here in business as well,

104
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:03,840
moving very rapidly. Interesting. And so, I think, so let's talk about one of the use case. So,

105
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,560
if you can sort of make it very, very sort of simple down to maybe for a five-year-old level,

106
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,000
right? So, what is deep learning as seen by, say, a typical use case? So, to help help me

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,640
and our audience understand what is deep learning, that would be helpful. Sure. So, we can split it

108
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,520
into two things. One is image processing and one is language processing, if you like. So,

109
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,960
if our data set consists of images, then we would use something called CNNs or convolutional

110
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,440
neural networks and the other type of neural networks called RNNs or recurrent neural networks,

111
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,240
they're used to process language information, whether that's speech or text, okay? In fact,

112
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:46,080
any time series, whereas video stream, market data, text or speech, RNNs. So, RNNs are perhaps

113
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,280
the more complicated because they're having to deal with the time series element, they have an

114
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:58,320
extra time element. CNNs are pretty much a solved technology, if you like, because they're processing

115
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,920
pixels and stationary images. So, whatever use case you can think for a company who wants to

116
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,000
develop and get value out of processing images or processing text, speech, market data, now,

117
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,600
that's any company in any vertical, it's basically unlimited, right? So, any use case you can think

118
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
of, I mentioned market data, so algorithmic traders on Wall Street are now using neural

119
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,520
networks to get the high-frequency trading advantage. Healthcare is a great one for me

120
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:34,080
because it's saving lives and curing cancer and helping us to live longer and better quality

121
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:42,720
lives. So, for example, radiology, FMRI scans, X-ray scans, these are images, right? And so,

122
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,000
you have a thousand images or a million, you can scan these very quickly using CNNs, okay?

123
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,160
And they can now do that more accurately and faster than any human radiologist who get paid

124
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,520
for $500,000 a year. And so, obviously, hospitals, so there's a lot of jobs in danger right now.

125
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,520
We talk about technological unemployment and these are high white collar jobs too,

126
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:11,120
not just robots and factory jobs, but yeah. So, that's a side issue, isn't it? We're getting

127
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,080
away from technology, but this has great social and political and economic ramifications that the

128
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:24,000
fact that these neural networks are going to replace our neural networks. Yeah, no, I think

129
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,600
that's well said. And in fact, I was having a conversation with one of the, I think he was

130
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,680
one of the executive friends and we had this conversation on that. I was reading an article

131
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:44,960
that the easiest job to replace by an AI is CEOs. So, that's like, so yeah, so I think that's why

132
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,800
and they are the, they are the one who paid the most in this equation. So, definitely,

133
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,920
it's funny how will and when will sort of, I'll have an AI boss. In fact, I do, like in my company,

134
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:08,240
there's something called Tau. It's a talent, it's an AI around career coaching. So, Tau is

135
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:17,520
in my boss. So, I'm kind of, so I think it'll be a fun drive to see how creepy or how cool that boss is.

136
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,920
Yeah, exactly. So, and then it brings up, so what are we going to do now that we're displaced for the

137
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,640
first time in history, right? We've had blue collar displacement through the industrial revolution

138
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:30,880
and PCs, right? But now, it's really, we're going to be able to replace everybody now,

139
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,080
including white collar CEOs, lawyers, doctors, everybody will be replaced eventually.

140
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:42,640
And it's happening now. So, how are we going to eat and live and survive? So, people are talking

141
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,680
about a universal basic income where the wealth is distributed because the wealth has been concentrated

142
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,640
more and more on a few, right? Google, Facebook, etc. And so, before I used to have IBM and AT&T

143
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,360
with a million, two million employees. And so, they were big companies, but that's,

144
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,480
the wealth was distributed amongst a lot of people. Now, Facebook can kind of have 20,000

145
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,960
employees and be bigger than AT&T and IBM combined. And so, you know, it really is, the inequality is

146
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,760
more than it ever has been in history in moving quicker and quicker. So, yeah, universal basic

147
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:21,840
income is kind of, which is basically another word for taxation and tax of rich and everything else.

148
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,280
And that really isn't... I think that's a scary slope. Yeah. Yeah, but it's something we have to

149
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:34,160
face is humanity, right? We do have to, and it's better to face it hit on now than wait, you know,

150
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:39,840
until it's kind of everybody's starving and in the street and... No, I think that's a very valid

151
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:48,080
point. And again, I think I'll be pushing my shameless plug here. But I think one of the

152
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,560
things that got us started in AI was the very fact that almost every AI is talking about

153
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,000
sort of shifting jobs or taking away jobs, but there's no AI to actually help save it, right?

154
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,120
So, there's a... So, I think where we are banking on is primarily there's a very broad area emerging

155
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,640
in which what if I'm an AI and I can help you stay employed? So, if suppose I'm seeing a new

156
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:22,960
trend, and one of the typical use that we give out is that say an example of an autonomous car

157
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,320
phenomena takes a truck driver's job away, right? So, what if we have a network of

158
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,400
a lot of truck drivers and we see one of one of a couple of those guys actually started doing

159
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,840
something called traffic analytics. So, suddenly sort of the network can propagate and say,

160
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:45,280
hey guys, why don't we all have a secondary or a tertiary career options? And pretty much like

161
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:51,840
that this AI is anyways, it's your assistant. It keeps grooming you, it keeps giving sort of these

162
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,520
alternate career options. Because I think the whole point of tech displacement is,

163
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,520
so we can free up our time here, so we can focus somewhere else.

164
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,240
Nice. Exactly, yeah. So, we got a question, you know, what is our purpose? What gives us meaning,

165
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,240
right? And so, for a lot of people getting up in the morning going to work, and that's fine too,

166
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,920
but that really won't be there for much longer. So, I'm a real optimist here and that we will

167
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
find meaning very easily. It's not something we should worry about, oh my god, we'll never have

168
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,440
meaning without work. I think we replace that with something else. As long as the, you know, we can

169
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,560
eat and have a roof over our heads and have an internet connection, Wi-Fi, right, basic human

170
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,320
right these days, we'll be good. It's a different world, we will get used to it,

171
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,080
but we've had four shifts already. We've had farming, we've had the industrial revolution,

172
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,440
we've had the PC and now the AI, and we've always moved. 98% of people used to work in farms,

173
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,200
now it's one lesson of 2%, okay, everything's automated on farms. So, we've moved comfortably

174
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:58,400
into industrial factories, and then we've moved comfortably into basically PCs and, you know,

175
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,840
cubicles, and now we're actually going to be free. It's almost like we're taking the chains off,

176
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:09,840
you know, we need to do what we want. For me, that's great, as long as there's enough that we

177
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:16,480
can eat, nobody gets left behind. So, I think that's a very noble thought. So, now let's talk

178
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,960
about businesses, right? So, let's sort of try to understand their problem. Say I'm a small business,

179
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,920
why would I care about something called AI, or why would I care about something called

180
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:34,000
machine learning? What are some of those pitches to those businesses who have,

181
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,200
anyways, no technical know-how, and they've been sort of getting this anxious about this emerging

182
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,560
keyword and jobs getting lost in all that phenomena. Yeah, so, yeah, you know, slightly

183
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,640
flippant is because Google are using it in all of their products and they're the second largest

184
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,240
company in the world. So, yeah, it works, okay? Now, that's it. That's the bottom line, okay?

185
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,840
Facebook too, and all the major tech company, Baidu, IBM, Microsoft, they're all using it.

186
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,920
They're all just replacing everything, all their algorithms, neural networks, okay? So,

187
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:09,440
if you're not sold on that, you might say, okay, well, that's okay for the big guys with all the tech,

188
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,600
but it's not that because they're using it in every product imaginable. HR,

189
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,880
search, just everything, okay? So, these big tech companies, even though they're tech companies,

190
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,160
they have the same functional units as any company, right? They have HR, they have legal,

191
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,720
they have accounting, they have all of these other departments, okay? So, that's one argument. The

192
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,320
second argument is, okay, so what do you guys do? What's your core competence? Okay, you're in

193
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,360
healthcare, okay? You're a legal company, you're retail, etc., okay? Here's how neural networks are,

194
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,800
not can be, but are being used by other legal companies right now, and medical companies,

195
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,160
and retail companies like Amazon, for example. Here's how, like Jeff Bezos three weeks ago

196
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,640
had an interview where he said, you know, neural networks, AI deep learning, you know,

197
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,640
he actually mentioned those words, you know, straight to the point, we're using them in

198
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,840
everything now, it really is our driver, our key driver at Amazon is deep learning now. So,

199
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,960
Amazon Alexa, Amazon X, so you mentioned these digital assistants, right? Well, that's the

200
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,320
natural language processing I talked about, RNNs. So, we're all going to have one, we kind of have

201
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,640
them now, Siri, Cortana, Google, now, but they'll just get better and better the more data they're

202
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,960
trained on, okay? They're like us as human beings, we were young, we get trained alphabet and numbers

203
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:37,360
and how to do math and how grammar works, okay? These things are capable of learning and getting

204
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,360
trained, the more data we give to them, whether it's medical data, our own data, so they help us,

205
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,560
or if I'm a healthcare or a retail company, the more data I can feed into it, either from

206
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,240
external sources or internal, the more it can help, the better a job it can do at helping us. So,

207
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,240
I don't know if that's answered your question, I've kept it very general rather than do a very

208
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,520
specific use case, but there are examples in the legal industry, there are companies now who use

209
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,760
neural networks, deep learning is paralegal, so basically quickly scan all the documents much

210
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:16,480
quicker than any young 20-year-old paralegal can and more accurately too. So, there's an example,

211
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,440
so the natural language processing, the technology's at the point where they can understand, it's

212
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,560
actually natural language understanding, written tech, so any company that uses people to read

213
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,640
and process and make decisions, I mentioned a legal one, can basically replace that process,

214
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,240
human beings with these neural networks, okay? Sounds scary. So, your sales pitch is to these

215
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:46,640
businesses is that everyone is using it and it's actually showing some real impact in the economic

216
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,680
structure of the businesses and almost all the verticals, as you're saying, are seeing an impact

217
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,720
or at least the incentive of going in this direction, so you should try it out too.

218
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,400
Yeah, but not say that's more of a leap of faith, right? It's more like, and here's how,

219
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,200
here's how these legal companies are using it, here's how Cisco are using it, here's how Amazon

220
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,440
are using it, in real use cases, because this information is public information, the actual

221
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,720
nitty-gritty fine points aren't because that's their competitive advantage, but the general

222
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,920
way, the use cases are definitely, I could Google now, you could too, anybody can, all the listeners,

223
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,360
Google neural networks, legal applications, and there'd be a hundred examples of companies

224
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:38,480
how they're using it, okay? It's not a secret. Right, interesting, interesting. So, now let's

225
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,560
talk about, I think, I'll go slightly on the technical aspect of deep theoretical AI. I think

226
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:53,120
one of the so-called drawbacks, or one of the right-handers in using these capabilities is

227
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,320
analysis paralysis, right? Creating the boundaries on where does it really end? When should the

228
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,760
learning begins and where should the learning stops? So, what are some of your thoughts around

229
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:13,440
those challenges for businesses? So, if I let my AI, in a deep learning case, if it can create,

230
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:20,960
say, multiple neural network nodes, layers, so then it can actually, it can extrapolate,

231
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,120
and then it can sort of dig deeper than it should, and it can connect two sort of non-related dots,

232
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,000
because somehow we are all connected, but not really from the business sense point of view.

233
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,480
So, how would you, what are some of your thoughts in that direction, if at all?

234
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Yeah, so that's a good question. It's an ongoing area of development. So,

235
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,960
you know, how can I, who's to say that this 100-layer neural network with a million nodes at

236
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,480
each layer, okay, so that's 100 million nodes, which a GPU these days can easily handle, okay?

237
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,880
10 years ago, it would have been, my God, that's going to take us a week to feed out

238
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,640
a million images or whatever text into it. Today, that can be done in half an hour using a new hardware.

239
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,720
So, that's, hardware is not an issue, but so how do I know if it's 99 layers, or 101 layers,

240
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:13,200
or 100 layers, right? And that's the fair question, and how do I know if it's a million nodes,

241
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,160
or 2 million there, right? We're not really constrained by layers or nodes anymore. Hardware

242
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:25,120
is good, good to go. So, that is, there's still a little bit, it's more of an art than a science

243
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,200
still. There's a little bit of, you know, magic in there, a little trial and error, not really

244
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,080
magic, but trial and error for sure. You know, the guys at Google, they kind of give you an

245
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,560
answer, right? The guys who write the scientific paper, they've done a lot of exploration that,

246
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:44,320
you know, we haven't, but they still, it's, it's, wow, you know, here's, here's, here's what we got

247
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,320
by trying different, it's an empirical science at the moment, okay? The underlying theory isn't

248
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,520
solved completely yet, okay? That's, that's the exciting part for me, actually, right?

249
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,400
Interesting, interesting. So, thank you so much for, for shedding, setting your thoughts on,

250
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,280
on that. So, now, let's talk about, again, get back to that, that business thingy, right? So,

251
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,080
I'm a business. So, you told me that, hey, everyone is doing it, you should do it too. There's,

252
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,280
there are some real numbers, real impact. Sure, I'm sold. So, now, what are some of, like,

253
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,680
first three steps that you would suggest to a small business that have no freaking clue?

254
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,840
Yeah. What, that, what AI even means, let alone using it in their business?

255
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,840
Sure, sure. What are some of the things that you can say, hey, maybe do these three things?

256
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,720
Get yourself seen or something. Yeah, well, I think, first of all, education is important.

257
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,480
You know, here's what a, here's what a neural, here's what a deep learning network, AI network,

258
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,440
here's what machine learning means. You know, here's why we are here today. Here's why companies are

259
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,640
using it. And here's where we are, you know, honestly, state of the art. And here's some

260
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,120
examples of how Google have used it or somebody, you know, if they're a law firm, here's some

261
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:04,000
examples of how, you know, your competitors are using it now and really impacting them.

262
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,800
You know, not, not just they're trying it out. Let's see how they go, really getting results

263
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,120
and have been for the last two or three years. Okay. The stuff hasn't just happened today,

264
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,680
it's been around a while. So, probably five years ago, they call it the big bang, really. So,

265
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:24,560
it's been around, it's not just starting today. It's, you know, it's, it's not a mature industry,

266
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:30,800
but there are people who have had these stuff for a good three years, right? So, that's not new.

267
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:38,880
They use it today, right? So, you're saying education is number one, that you said, like,

268
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,800
educate yourself. What are the other two things that a small business could do to get good?

269
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,040
Yeah. So, that's education. That's number one. That's good. And so, number two, probably then,

270
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,040
obviously, it's the same process. So, new technology, same processes. Some things don't

271
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,400
change. Proof of concept, right? Let's have a little trial. Let's put a,

272
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,560
let's run it on a small cluster, one computer, a small cluster on your laptop, something,

273
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:08,000
and feed this data set in, this small data set, you know, a subset of your larger data set,

274
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,480
the legal company. Let's just feed it a thousand documents, not a million, right?

275
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,320
And on your laptop, with this neural network, it could be off the shelf open source. Okay. A lot

276
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,800
of this stuff's open source, which is accelerating it. So, it could be TensorFlow. Okay. It could be

277
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:29,280
MXNet. It could be CNTK. And that's the Google, Amazon, and Microsoft versions in that order,

278
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Facebook use Torch. Okay. So, as a consultant, I should know which one probably is the better

279
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:40,240
choice for your data set, actually. That's the value that I would add. Okay. Rather than trying

280
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,720
them all one at a time, I could say, actually, well, you know, TensorFlow is probably better choice

281
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:50,240
than CNTK or Weisweiser, and here's why. Okay. So, that will save you time and money.

282
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,160
But that's a proof of concept. And if it helps, if it works, if you're convinced,

283
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,720
at the results of a small data set running on a small piece of hardware, then we could scale it

284
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,440
up. Let's put all your data in, and let's use a cluster, right? A cluster computing,

285
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,400
you know, not necessarily Hadoop, but the whole, you know, distributed processing cluster,

286
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,120
cluster computing. Let's run it on the cloud. Let's run it on Amazon, if you're happy with that,

287
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,960
or else in your own data center. So, let's scale it up now from one to 100 nodes. Okay.

288
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,880
And let's put all your data set in there, you know. Interesting. Step three. Yeah.

289
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,440
Yeah. I think that that's great. So, get a trial run and then use one of the frameworks.

290
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:41,680
So, now, I think, and again, I'm taking slight detour. And I think because you peak my interest

291
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:49,680
around TensorFlow and MXNet and CentOS and Keras, which one is your favorite and which

292
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:54,160
and why and which was the least favorite and why? Yeah, probably TensorFlow, I like. A number of

293
00:27:54,160 --> 00:28:01,280
users are approaching 50,000 on GitHub, which is the highest ever, you know, even more than Linux.

294
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:07,440
This is happening so fast, exponential, very steep. So, that's one reason, the popularity.

295
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Second reason, Google's behind it, and they have very good engineers, and people do respect them

296
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:19,360
for that. Okay. And the third reason is that, you know, looking at these myself, evaluating,

297
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,520
looking at the code and the examples, you know, TensorFlow is good. It's got a good documentation.

298
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,040
Yeah, lots of reasons. Okay. Amazon is, they have good engineers too. So, that's not really a

299
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,280
differentiator. Why not use MXNet? Well, you can actually, it has, it has, there's always pros and

300
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,680
cons. And then CNTK is Microsoft, they have good engineers. And so, you know, why shouldn't I use

301
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:46,960
my, you know, it depends really, okay. And, you know, rather than get into each and every,

302
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,600
there's probably 12 metrics on each one. And you could draw a matrix, right? All the open source on

303
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,800
on the Y and 12 metrics on the X. And you would have checks in the boxes. And yeah, almost three

304
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,000
dimensional, then you have the application as well, dimension. So, it's complicated. You have to

305
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,960
know your stuff. And that's where the experts come in and make their money, right? Right. So,

306
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:19,520
now, which one is your least favorite and why? Oh, boy, probably the older ones. I don't know,

307
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,520
you know, they, they, they're all, they've all been good in their time, like Tiano,

308
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,480
Cafe, we're very good in their time because they're kind of the only one, the only game in town.

309
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,360
But now they've been very quickly superseded. When Google announced in November 2015, right,

310
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,120
that they're open sourcing, they're basically their artificial neural network, you know,

311
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,560
the world changed as far as I'm concerned, because then everybody had to open source theirs.

312
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,640
And so that, that really was a big bang. That's a beautiful thing. That's a beautiful thing.

313
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,800
Suddenly, Piano didn't, wasn't as competitive anymore. I'm not saying it's bad. It just,

314
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,560
it just wasn't as competitive. You know, so there's never been a bad software package. It's just,

315
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:03,520
they get superseded quite quickly. Interesting. Interesting. So now,

316
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,360
now let's talk about, let's, let's talk about the industry as such. I think you, you peak,

317
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,880
you peak my interest around when you talk about these frameworks. And I think you actually

318
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
is a very interesting point that most of these vendors now they just came up and they open sourced

319
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,720
it to compete with sort of TensorFlow. So I think that's a beautiful thing. So what are some

320
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,560
of the nice things you're observing in the industry regarding the adoption of AI? So if you

321
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,600
can set some light on that. Yeah, well, for example, it's been very good. It's made everything nice

322
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,080
and competitive and everything out in the open. So, you know, MXNet, they keep upgrading,

323
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,360
CNTK, the Microsoft one that they went from to, they just released version two a couple of months

324
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,320
ago with a heck of a lot more features than they ever would have if Google hadn't have open sourced

325
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,560
TensorFlow. So they've all been, everyone has been forced to a work on it very quickly and

326
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,760
be open sourced it very quickly too. So not everyone just adopts TensorFlow. So if you look

327
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,400
at the GitHub, I think MXNet has got over 10,000, you know, TensorFlow is a clear leader, 50,000,

328
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,160
10,000, CNTK, 10,000, which is quite phenomenal, really. It's like, so people aren't just all

329
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:16,080
going for TensorFlow. Okay, they are, you know, they are using the other frameworks as well,

330
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,920
whether that's a side-by-side comparison, or we're just going to use it because it's better

331
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:26,800
for our dataset. We're not sure. But so, yeah, competition is always a good thing. And it really

332
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:34,560
does move the field quicker. Nice. Yeah. So now, now let's talk about people a bit. So I have heard

333
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:41,360
about there's a keyword called AI. And I have, I have heard that they have been getting industry's

334
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,240
best salaries out there. So I'm interested in getting myself into AI. So what are some of the

335
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,040
two to three things you would suggest or you would advise me to get me started?

336
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:58,400
Yeah. So again, I, you know, if you're the CTO, CIO, Chief Data Officer, even CEO in a company or,

337
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,040
you know, the, you know, lead architect, and you've heard about AI and you know that you're

338
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:06,880
going to be left behind, you need to start reading up on this stuff. And there's a whole bunch of

339
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,640
stuff on the internet, YouTube, beautiful tech tutorials that people have, you know, a love

340
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:19,680
of labor just put it out there for people. Okay. And the internet, you know, can be underestimated

341
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:23,440
the impact that the internet is having on all of this technology development. So that's the

342
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,480
platform. People are putting high quality training out there for it. There's no excuse. Okay. It's

343
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,840
very easy to learn. Not so many books out there. It's too new, right? It's just moving so quick

344
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,440
and it's too new. Stamford is open source, same with MIT and Princeton, all the great universities

345
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,920
of the world. Oxford as well have a great course on neural networks, you know, by the

346
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:52,480
top researcher in the world. Same with Stamford, you know, they offer CNNs and RNNs, two separate

347
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,600
courses. You know, it's just incredible. I mean, this stuff wouldn't have happened 10 years ago

348
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,640
that today. No, I think, I think yes, you are actually raising a very good point that these

349
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,760
so there are a lot of good MOOCs out there. Yeah, I think definitely well said that

350
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,520
guys should check that out. Yeah, just dive in. That's the main thing. Yeah.

351
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,040
Interesting. Interesting. So now, now let's talk about so you said if I'm a business,

352
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,080
I should go I should go and check it out. Now let's

353
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:31,840
now let's talk about build versus buy versus like what are some of your thoughts on also

354
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,400
if suppose I have no freaking clue what AI is and I've heard and I have seen the impact.

355
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,400
What are some of the things you would suggest for me that should I acquire AI talent or should

356
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,440
I build and grow an AI talent? Yeah, so that's a great question. So really, you want to get,

357
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,320
you know, say let's just use TensorFlow as an example, get your team of architects, you know,

358
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,640
so I made a transition, I was a systems engineer for Google IBM as a consultant,

359
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,280
I've made a transition myself over to AI deep learning so it can be done if you're a techie

360
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:08,240
kind of minded person and your curiosity will be driving you anyway. I can't imagine there's

361
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,200
any CIOs who haven't, you know, done some MOOC or something, right, because that's why you're in

362
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,960
the business, you know, you love it because of that. And so the second reason is that commercial,

363
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:25,360
you want your company to succeed, be competitive and to win even, right. So those two are very

364
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:31,520
strong drivers. So you're just going to basically, so let's say TensorFlow, I've done some reading,

365
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,400
I'm a CIO, a curious guide, I want my business to succeed, I've seen my competitors already

366
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,040
trialing it. Okay, so I'm going to download TensorFlow on my laptop, get some data, get a

367
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,160
data set and try it out. Okay, and then, and then get my team up to speed and three or four of us

368
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,600
and myself will do a little proof of concept. And then if it works, we'll get the visible

369
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,120
show our results to business and give them a business taste, right. And if we get sign off,

370
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:05,840
we'll scale it. Okay. Now, that's us doing it internally. The other way we could do it is go

371
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:11,200
get an Accenture or my company or somebody out there consulting to come in and do it for us. Okay,

372
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,960
that's going to be a little more expensive. And at the end, you might not, if something goes wrong,

373
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,200
you know, it's not a you'll have to keep paying the money, right. So ultimately, you want to

374
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,160
gain this knowledge and do it yourself. How you get there is either go to an outside consulting

375
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,640
company or you do it yourself. Probably you might, I don't know, you know, some people,

376
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,040
some engineers are very, very clever. And I know they could do it themselves. Others,

377
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,520
it's not their core competence, you know, they're Walmart, they may sell products, they're not a,

378
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:42,080
you know, or, you know, a small online retail company with, you know, a single owner,

379
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,160
you know, that they're not a techie person, they want to serve people that that's what gives them

380
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,800
great joy and pleasure, not so much the technical side, they're going to have to get outside help.

381
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:00,720
That's interesting. I think that's that's a very valid point. So one thing that that we hear a lot

382
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,840
from from many of our clients is the concern that market is crowded. So they're like almost every

383
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,440
so one, I think one executive put it the best, he said, Vishal, you know what,

384
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,360
everyone is trying to sell us, no one is trying to tell us, right. So that's the problem. Okay.

385
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,080
So now, in that scenario, like what are some of some of the, some of the idea suggestions that you

386
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,360
can give to a bunch of these executives, like if I'm recruiting in a consulting firm, or if I'm

387
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,640
recruiting, say, our contractors or whatever, what are some of the things that I should keep in

388
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,560
mind? Or what are some of the hacks or some of the tips or tricks that you would suggest that

389
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,160
these executives should know, so they can hire the best consulting team further for the job.

390
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,640
Yeah. So part of this is being able to sell, right, being a good, you know, part of being a good

391
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,560
leader, a consultant is the ability to sell, basically, and not just sell BS, but, you know,

392
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,760
you know, it's got to be real. So, you know, that's one of the things, you know, in the past life,

393
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,400
my physics, I used to be a teacher, right, so I could teach people new ideas, concepts in the

394
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,640
math and everything behind it. It's no different. I just get in there in front of the executive.

395
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,120
I think this is a wonderful opportunity for me to help improve the world, basically, right,

396
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,120
because we're putting, we're driving stuff forward, automating, making everything more

397
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:21,600
efficient. So I believe in my cause, okay, that's the number one thing, you know, I have the vision,

398
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:26,160
I have the belief, and this is a good thing, it's the right thing for humanity, it's the right thing

399
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,720
for business, okay. It's inevitable, a technological unemployment will be worked out, okay. So let's

400
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:38,320
do the best we can. So from there, then you just, it's a matter of selling in the technology,

401
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,640
here's a neural network, here's what it looks like, here's the architecture, layers, nodes,

402
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,760
here's TensorFlow, here's another one, here's your data set, and here's how, here's your value

403
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,600
proposition, that's it. Right. So I think let me put it this way. So if suppose,

404
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,640
say you are the business, right, and you want to hire a consulting firm to help your business,

405
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,880
so what are like some of two or three sort of things, or what are some of the things that you

406
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,160
would consider when hiring a consulting firm to help you? So what are some of the three, two to

407
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,960
two things that you would consider as an executive to hire for your company?

408
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,280
Yeah, okay, so budget first, okay. If your budget's good, if you're a bigger company,

409
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,080
then you go for quality, right? You say, okay, the Accentures, the McKinsey's,

410
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:26,160
you know, the Booz Allen Hamilton's, the Deloitte, you know, people with very strong

411
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,120
reputations that they're not strong for, they're strong for a reason, they've been around 100

412
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:36,880
years or 50 years, and you know, they built that reputation, reputation. So it's like buying a car,

413
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,400
I've got money so I can go get a Rolls Royce or a Lamborghini, right? Actually, I'm budget limited,

414
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,040
so I'm going to, I want the Lamborghini and a Rolls Royce, so I'm going to get a company that

415
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,720
I can have faith in, but I can't afford Accenture right now, you know, in the future, I will be

416
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,760
that, you know, everybody wants to succeed, but right now, you know, so maybe that's where I would

417
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,440
come in, you know, I don't charge the $300 an hour that Accenture might, or however much they,

418
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,840
you know, I don't want to boil this down to that, but it's like, okay, you know, I think I can actually

419
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:17,200
do a better job maybe than Accenture. So you're suggesting that budget is a concern, so budget

420
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,920
is one concern that you would consider when hiring a consulting firm or a contracting firm,

421
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,720
what are some of the other considerations that you think that someone would think about when

422
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,080
hiring a firm? Yeah, so quality, definitely the quality factor too, okay, so yeah, not every, you

423
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,760
know, if people, the budget and quality are kind of matched, aren't they, if you've got

424
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,760
unlimited budget, you probably should go for the best quality, there's no real reason not to, but

425
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:49,440
if so, how do, so is there any, is there any kind of reputation index, or is there anything out there

426
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,120
that's supposed, if, how would I know if your firm is any good or better than Accenture? Yeah,

427
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:01,040
or how, like, are there, like, what are some of the tools that I would know, yeah, that for this

428
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:08,560
particular job, for a, for an industry like mine, a boutique firm like yours, Vis-A-Vis of Accenture,

429
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:14,880
like, what are some of, is there anything out there that I can, I can look for, or? Not really,

430
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,640
so reputation is, you'll read, yeah, you should do your due diligence, absolutely, yeah, encourage

431
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,400
that 100%. So, so basically you're looking at reputation, aren't you really, so reputation

432
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,400
is built over time, okay, so the boutique firm, firm might be newer, so it's slightly more risky,

433
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,120
I guess, but so you do your research, you talk to the people, pick up the phone, talk to people,

434
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,840
look at the website, pick up the phone, have meetings with the people, maybe four or five

435
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,880
firms, maybe, you know, two or three big ones, and two or three small boutiques, and then make

436
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,480
your decision, right, I think that's the way people do anything, buying a car, hiring a consultant,

437
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,000
so it's no different there, yeah, boutique firms might have more deeper knowledge than some of

438
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,520
the bigger guys, actually, that's my, sure, yeah, I think that makes sense, so now let's, let's talk

439
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,400
about, we'll dig a bit further into talent, so now not really consulting firms, so suppose

440
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,520
if you want to hire your next hire in your consulting firm, an AI talent, what are some

441
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,920
of the things that you would look for in that candidate, and what are some of the things that

442
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,400
you would not look for in a candidate? Yeah, technically, first of all, you know, you got to

443
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,200
know your staff, if it's a technical role, if it's a more of a product manager role, it'd be

444
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,480
selling ability and presentation skills more, but for technical roles, yeah, you got to know,

445
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:44,560
you have to have some hands-on on some of the frameworks like MXNet, TensorFlow, and demonstrable

446
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,520
hands-on, maybe a GitHub account, for example, with some neural network work on display, okay,

447
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,200
and it's, you know, not just from yesterday, but from six to 12 months ago, so yeah, maybe you've

448
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,840
worked in a company already, a startup, or a major company, and you're looking for your next move,

449
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:06,160
so it's all demonstrable, and then, you know, just the interviewing process itself,

450
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,120
it's just a new technology, again, same process, different technology.

451
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,680
So, so you're suggesting that they should have some hands-on on the frameworks that are out there

452
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,320
today, and they should be able to demonstrate sort of their comfort level in these platforms,

453
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:29,360
because I think you may not, so I think that's another question, so how different are these

454
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:35,360
frameworks from each other, so if I say no TensorFlow, is it, do I know Keras or MXNet,

455
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:42,240
like, do I know other platforms, or like, how different, how polar are these platforms from

456
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,200
each other? Yeah, that's a great question, so yes and no, so the underlying technology, the

457
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:53,280
layers and the nodes, and in the optimization algorithms, the regularization is dropout,

458
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,360
there's all these techniques and methodologies that people in the industry know and know about,

459
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,720
okay, so how TensorFlow implements that, or MXNet or CNTK, it's going to be in there, okay,

460
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,520
it's going to be three lines of code, which will be slightly different in each, you know,

461
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,160
framework, okay, but it's more important to know about the optimization algorithm,

462
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,520
it's more important to know about the algorithms in fact, we shall be honest, okay,

463
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,640
and then the coding is, oh it might be done in Python, Torch, well it's going to be done in Lua,

464
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,800
C++, it's TensorFlow, it's going to be done in Python, MXNet can do it in R and Julia and Python

465
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,720
and C++, it has the most different languages, that's one reason people choose MXNet actually,

466
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,920
so the language as a programmer yourself, we know we can pick out Python or C++ or Ruby if we have

467
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,720
to, so it's more a deep understanding of the algorithms and being able to understand why

468
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,640
I would use this algorithm. Interesting, I think valid point, so now let's

469
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,440
spend a few minutes on chatbots, that's a massive craze nowadays, I think it's almost like,

470
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,960
I would say about half of the companies that I hear about nowadays in AI,

471
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,880
they're doing some other version of chatbot, so how is how real or unreal is this phenomena

472
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:16,880
and if you can shed some light on that? Yeah absolutely, so chatbots are in LP remember,

473
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,240
they're recurrent rule, they work, so that's straight into the technical side of things, so

474
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:29,360
yeah, so chatbots for me, in LP are images, so language, if we as, what makes us unique as humans,

475
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,080
one of the major things is our understanding of language, so chatbots are going to be,

476
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,440
they are the killer app, there's no doubt about this, in my mind, because if you understand

477
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,400
language, you have human level intelligence, you can plan, you can reason, you can communicate and

478
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:50,800
talk intelligently, so when Siri, I can ask Siri, what time's the next bus, where can I

479
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,960
order a pizza, what's on at the movies, tell me about the meaning of live, tell me about the

480
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,920
subplot of Macbeth, etc., to understand, not just go out to Wikipedia, cut and paste, but to

481
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,040
understand, and that's the point we're actually at right now, so yeah, chatbots, they are AI, right?

482
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,440
Interesting, and what's, to your perspective, what's next, like what is, so five years, what

483
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,760
would be your prophecy for say, one year down the line, five year and ten year down the line,

484
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:29,440
what are some of three things that you would anticipate seeing in next year, in next five

485
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:37,360
and in next ten years? Okay, yeah, great question, so yeah, brave new, utopia, right? Yes, nothing

486
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:44,400
less, nothing less, okay, so yes, it all goes wrong, I see a world in ten years time where,

487
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,840
you know, automation is 50% of, you know, people are out of work and enjoying their lives much,

488
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,800
much more than they are now, doing jobs, they're not particularly, you know, and thinking that, oh

489
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,600
yeah, I used to, looking back and laughing quaintly to themselves, oh, I used to derive meaning out of

490
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,480
that job, you know, and, you know, there's a lot more to life than that, so that's the vision,

491
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,040
that's utopia, that's where we want, okay, there's dystopia, most of science fiction movies, Terminator,

492
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:15,600
are all about, you know, the bad effects, oh, they're gonna go rogue and turn on us,

493
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:20,640
okay, we'll leave that to one side, I have a Facebook group called AI Safety, which looks into

494
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:28,000
research work, Stuart Russell at Berkeley has just written a book, Do the Right Thing, just

495
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,080
published on Amazon, I just found out about it today, in fact, and I put it straight on my AI Safety.

496
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Now, he wrote the book on artificial intelligence, mine, okay, him and Peter Norvig at Google,

497
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,960
wrote the book on artificial intelligence, A Modern Approach, which everybody uses, okay,

498
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,720
so it's no small matter, he's just published this book on AI Safety, okay,

499
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:53,360
trying to downplay all the doomsaing bits that we get from movies and kind of gets ingrained here

500
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,600
as kids, and it's kind of hard to remove, okay, he's like, okay, so, you know, here are the theoretical

501
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:03,200
limits on AI, this is what they can do, this is what they certainly cannot do, so don't be afraid,

502
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,960
because there are limits on this stuff, okay, there are limits, I'm a physicist by training,

503
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:14,240
the laws of physics constrain stuff, okay, things are constrained, they just don't go, you know,

504
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:18,720
so, yeah, this is a bit of a problem right now, the fear of the unknown, okay, so,

505
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,800
10 years, I want to see utopia, I want to see basic income, I want to see people get deriving

506
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:29,920
more meaning out of their life than just going to empty jobs, okay, capitalism has definitely

507
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:36,720
got us to where we are, I'm not anti-capitalist, I'm pro, but, you know, I'm also pro-reality as

508
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,800
well, things are changing, let's embrace the change, let's embrace the change.

509
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:47,840
Interesting, so I think one area that I definitely want to touch slightly on before we part ways,

510
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,680
I think I would love to know your perspective on some of the use cases in which AI sucks,

511
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,800
whoa, some of the use cases in which AI is not efficient.

512
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,000
Oh, none really, none, no, because what the big picture here, I think that you're missing is that

513
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:11,280
these artificial, they're basically replacing our neural networks, they're not replacing us

514
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:19,200
as human beings, okay, but they're replacing our neural networks, okay, and that's not scary,

515
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,360
for me that's a good thing, because we'll be able to free up and do stuff, creative stuff,

516
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:31,040
okay, so that's basically, so nothing sucks, okay, you know, we had jeopardy, we had chess,

517
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:36,080
we had jeopardy, we had go, and now we're having them beating poker, okay, Carnegie Mellon recently

518
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,200
beating poker, one by one, they're beating us at everything they shall, so don't ever think that,

519
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:46,320
oh, they sucked, they're never going to work, it's just not true, okay, things fail, right,

520
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:55,040
experimentation, you know, taking risks, you know, people who take risks do so because they have to,

521
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:00,720
okay, Richard Branson, Larry Page, Bill Gates, they have to entrepreneur Steve Jobs,

522
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,880
he didn't have to do the iPhone, but he had to, you know, something in him had to do that, okay,

523
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:13,680
it's the same with AI, you know, we can't stop it, the researchers, mistakes are going to happen,

524
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:20,960
but so what, in any, any take, but I think so, I think you raised a very good point, so one

525
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,760
area that you suggested was, okay, so now AI is taking away three, so that we'll get more time to

526
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:33,440
do arts, so now for something like art, do you think AI can do art? Yeah, that's a great point,

527
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:38,880
okay, so the bit I skimmed over was that we are still going to be here as humans, us, we're whole,

528
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,720
you know, we have a certain amount of intelligence, there are eight, nine different types of intelligence,

529
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:50,000
there's rational math, okay, logic, that's one, but only one, there's eight more, there's creativity,

530
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,920
you just mentioned, painter, music, writing, okay, there's language, there's social interaction,

531
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:01,920
there's introspection, right, that's a form of intelligence, understanding ourselves,

532
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,360
understanding our environment, understanding others, those are three types of intelligence,

533
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,320
there are others as well, there's commercial business intelligence, you know, we're not all

534
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,400
Bill Gates, okay, I haven't got 90 billion because he's better at it than I am, okay,

535
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,560
and you have to admit it, Einstein was better at physics than I am, okay, so there's all these

536
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:26,960
different types of intelligence, we will still be us with our, we're starting to understand

537
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,520
by developing AI and getting thrashed at chess and go and being humbled completely,

538
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,720
right, by these AI neural networks, that yeah, we're limited now, we used to be the center of

539
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:42,480
the universe, Galileo displays that, oh wait, no, we go around the sun through careful observation,

540
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,920
and then, you know, slowly but slowly our egos are being brought down to size, it's like, you know

541
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:52,560
what, we're the best that biology can do is intelligence on this planet, but there's probably

542
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:56,960
many other planets out there, okay, as a physicist again, cosmology is a big part of my,

543
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:04,240
right, but I think that's a very good point, and I think last month I was talking to one of the

544
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:11,600
executives, and the conversation went into this idea of, so this is my theory of what's happening,

545
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,160
right, so I'll give you a quick bit, so I was, I was, I was pitching this guy, there are two

546
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,840
things, there's art of doing business, and there's this science of doing business, right, so science

547
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:29,280
and art working together makes a business, right, so my pitch to them was that the computational

548
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,760
part is the science, science is predictable, right, science, science is formulative, science is

549
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:42,560
something that, that sort of can, so, but the art, art is you, art is a bunch of people working

550
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,880
together to create an outcome, right, those, those phenomenas, it's, it's a very sort of

551
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:54,480
non-calculative, very qualitative phenomena, in many aspects, so the discussion went into the,

552
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:00,960
the side of that, if, so the technology like AI, right, they push the limit, so they say

553
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:07,280
they're doing such a beautiful job at science, somehow we are confusing them with art, right,

554
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:15,040
so now imagine a business that says, okay, I will do less and less art, because science to me is

555
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:21,120
almost like an art, right, and then with the next upgrade, your entire core competency washed away,

556
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:26,160
right, because your core competency is based out of a partly of art and a partly of science,

557
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:32,320
so what's, what's your thinking, what's, what's, what's your thought on, on that phenomenon?

558
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:36,720
Yeah, okay, so we're at now as we've kind of solved all these narrow intelligence, we've,

559
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,040
we've beat chess, we've beat go, we do a lot, we've image classified images more accurately than the

560
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,080
human being can, amazingly, okay, it's taken most people by storm, including Sergey Brin who said,

561
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:52,320
I never saw this coming, right, you know, so yeah, if we can take him by surprise,

562
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:57,120
it can take everyone by surprise, I guess, but it's taken me by surprise, it's happened very

563
00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:04,880
quickly, and Google DeepMind in London is 350 PhDs in physics and neuroscience and computer

564
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:10,240
science and language. That's, that's, I think that's a fascinating, so thank you so much again,

565
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,200
Peter, I think before we part off, I would love to have you have a closing statement on that, so

566
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:21,360
yeah, okay, okay, yeah, so let me just go back to age, I didn't say that the key goal now is to

567
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:26,080
develop general intelligence, which have the, what you mentioned and all of the ones I mentioned,

568
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,760
introspect, ability to introspect itself, ability to communicate, understand other people,

569
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:38,640
emotional intelligence, there's people at working at MIT on exactly that, and so this general

570
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:44,080
intelligence is not solved, we have bits and pieces, we need to either come up with a more

571
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:48,880
underlying theory of intelligence, which might come from understanding how the brain works more,

572
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,440
in other words, through observation, if I'm right, exactly how the neurons all work,

573
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,840
the different types of neurons, and then replicate that, which is a little bit what artificial

574
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:05,600
neural networks do, they're replicating the, basically, how the biological neuron does it

575
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:12,000
integrate and fire, actually, so that's where we're at, we're very good at certain types of tasks,

576
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,040
and we want to make it general, we want, we want an iPhone that can, a AI that can drive a car,

577
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:26,400
talk to you emotionally, intelligently, just like having a passenger beside us, okay, we want

578
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:30,800
to build that, but it'll be smarter, faster, and quicker, okay, science fiction, no, not really,

579
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,200
we've had so many developments that we can forget about science fiction, it's going to happen,

580
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,560
whether it's 5, 10, we don't know exactly, and it will keep improving on the S-curve, Ray Kurzweil

581
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:47,680
talks about the singularity is near, right, that's when we do get AI, EGI, so that's it, that's the

582
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,520
goal, that's what I get out of bed in the morning for, is to push that board and companies, and then

583
00:54:53,520 --> 00:55:00,000
just keep putting in the latest algorithms and TensorFlow, okay, and other learning frameworks,

584
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:07,200
but ultimately, you know, bits are being added to make them more general, so that's exciting,

585
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,400
and that keeps me going, they call us the fourth industrial revolution, I'm happy to be a part

586
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,840
of it. Thank you so much, Peter, I think we won't have been said any better, so, and again,

587
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:23,680
I do truly appreciate you sharing your wisdom, I think a couple of things that we learned from

588
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:30,160
the conversation is, study, everything is out there, they are good courses, if you want to equip

589
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,440
yourself, what's going on, if you need to hire some consulting, do some due diligence on them,

590
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:42,080
and definitely, thanks to a very vibrant open source community, almost every framework out

591
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:47,200
there is blessed with a lot of support, and there's no sort of clear winner, they all are sort of

592
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:54,000
playing their clear role, I think that is really, really helpful to know, and definitely, we wish

593
00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,960
you all the luck with your consulting firm, and love to probably have you back sometime and share

594
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:07,040
your story and success and failures, and share with our audience, and good luck, and thank you so

595
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,880
much for your time. Thank you for having me, yeah, it's been fun, it's been great. Awesome.

596
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:33,920
this is how I'm breaking down, I hope I'm not up on this
