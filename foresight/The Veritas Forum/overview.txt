Checking The Veritas Forum/The Resurrection Argument That Changed a Generation of Scholars ï½œ Gary Habermas at UCSB.txt
1. The speaker has been working with a clinical psychologist for 20 years, focusing on why people doubt their faith. They've found that the majority (70-85%) of doubters do so for emotional reasons rather than factual ones.

2. C.S. Lewis provides an example of this, as his mother's illness and her subsequent death led him to become an atheist, despite praying for her recovery.

3. A survey indicates that a significant percentage of atheists are angry at God, which prompts reflection on how one can be upset with someone they don't believe exists.

4. The speaker emphasizes that most people, including both believers and atheists, approach data with some level of bias or "jaundiced eyes," influenced by their personal experiences, emotions, and preconceptions.

5. The speaker points out that the scientific community, often perceived as objective, is also subject to emotional biases, especially in fields like the origin of life, where a naturalistic perspective may be preferred due to personal inclinations or aversions to alternative viewpoints.

6. The speaker concludes by stressing the importance for everyone, both believers and atheists, to critically assess their own biases and consider whether their views are supported by the evidence or merely a reflection of their prejudices.

7. The Veritas Forum provides resources, discussions, and events on topics like faith and reason, and more information about their work can be found on their website at veritas.org.
