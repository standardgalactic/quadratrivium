00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
My first Nellian.

00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
Let's go.

00:04.000 --> 00:10.000
My first baby mama, my first ketamine experience, my first addiction.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.000
Here's what I want to start with.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
I love some of the things that you say.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
And one of the things you said is,

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
don't follow your passion.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.000
People who are already rich tell you to follow your passion.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
You should follow your talent.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
Can you unpack that? Can you explain what you mean?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
I wanted to be an athlete.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
That was my passion.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
And then I'm going to UCLA as a blessing,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
because I figured out pretty quickly that I wasn't in the 0.1% you need to be

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
and to make your living as an athlete.

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
And there's a fair, there's some pretty basic axioms

00:50.000 --> 00:54.000
that should guide your career choices around where you invest your most,

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
precious capital, and that is your time, your human capital.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
The first is the sexier the business, the lower return on investment.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.000
You want to be in fashion, the arts, movies, modeling, sports.

01:07.000 --> 01:13.000
Unless you get really incandescent green lights from a very early age,

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
so you're going to be in the 0.1%,

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
try and make a living somewhere else and then do that on the weekends.

01:19.000 --> 01:26.000
And that is if you, the SAG-AFTRA, the most talented actors in the world,

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
it's hard to get a SAG-AFTRA union card.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
You have to actually ban something.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
These are the most talented actors in the world, 182,000 of them.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
87% of them don't qualify for health insurance

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
because they don't make more than $23,000 in a given year.

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
So the key is finding, not finding your passion, but finding your talent

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
and then committing to developing mastery.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
And if you can develop mastery in anything that has a 90% plus employment rate,

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
which 98% of sectors enjoy, the economic accoutrements, the camaraderie,

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
the prestige, the relevance, just the sheer joy of mastery

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
will make you passionate about whatever it is.

02:02.000 --> 02:06.000
And I'm passionate about taking care of my kids.

02:06.000 --> 02:09.000
I'm passionate about being able to step in and help my aging father.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
I'm passionate about, I'd rather be Raphael Nadal or Federer,

02:14.000 --> 02:19.000
but I'd rather be me than the number three or number four tennis player in the world

02:19.000 --> 02:23.000
because I have financial security, I get to go to Wimbledon on my own terms

02:23.000 --> 02:27.000
and not be as nervous and not throw up or before a match.

02:27.000 --> 02:32.000
So yeah, I'd rather be Nadal, but pretty much anyone else playing tennis, I'd rather be.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
And I got there with boring companies.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.000
So the less sexy a business, the higher the return on investment.

02:40.000 --> 02:45.000
So I would suggest that we stop, you know, think about, well, what could I be good at?

02:45.000 --> 02:49.000
I think that's what your 20s are for, workshopping stuff and also getting it wrong.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
I started in investment banking and I was terrible at it.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.000
I didn't like them, they didn't like me.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.000
And I had to go back to business school and just start workshopping.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Where could I be great?

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
What industry could I be great in?

03:00.000 --> 03:06.000
So don't, you know, find what you're good at and then get great at it

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
and then be a DJ on the weekends.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.000
By the way, congratulations today.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
Today's the release date of the book, right?

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Algebra of wealth.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Today is the day.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
So that's, that's going to be huge.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
I mean, I read the algebra of happiness a while ago and I've been watching the videos forever.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
And so I kind of, I didn't get an early copy of the book, but I will buy it and read it.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
And so you'll get my $23.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
I need you to, by the way, we're number one on Amazon today.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I just thought I would drop that because I'm desperate.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I'm desperate for your affirmation, Sam.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
That's all right. I'll give it to you.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
I'll give it to you.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I won't starve you from that.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
You've got it.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
I look up to you.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
I think you're the man.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
Thank you.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Well, let me ask you about the number one on Amazon real quick.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
You, you're a pretty stoic guy.

03:45.000 --> 03:50.000
In fact, when you come on the pod, it's always surprising to me that you are so even keel,

03:50.000 --> 03:52.000
but it's the launch day of your book.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
You worked on this thing really hard.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.000
Your number one on Amazon, what, how does Scott Galloway celebrate?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Oh, you know, I'm not, I'm pretty flat.

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
I don't, I congratulate the team.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
It feels great.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
It's very gratifying.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
I love benchmarks.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
I'm addicted to me.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Everyone's addicted to something.

04:09.000 --> 04:13.000
I'm addicted to strangers affirmation, which is kind of pathetic at my age.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
And that's a form of affirmation, but it's very rewarding because so many people work

04:18.000 --> 04:23.000
so goddamn hard on this thing, just not me, but, you know, my research is my analyst,

04:23.000 --> 04:28.000
my PR people, my social people, my publisher, my book agent, you know, greatness is in the

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
agency of others.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
So it's just very gratifying.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
And plus my podcast co-hosts got to number three on the best sellers list.

04:35.000 --> 04:40.000
So goddamn it, if I'm not going to get to number two, I must beat Kara Swisher.

04:40.000 --> 04:45.000
So, Sam, if you could go buy several thousand books, I'd appreciate it.

04:45.000 --> 04:48.000
And if you like it, write a review.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
And if you hate it, please buy more and send them to an enemy.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.000
But yeah, I'm addicted to external affirmation.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
It's really pathetic.

04:56.000 --> 05:02.000
Well, so, I mean, the book, from my understanding, is that it's basically talks about the people

05:02.000 --> 05:05.000
who have money and the people who don't, and what are the commonalities between the winners

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
and the losers.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And you have, I've read this for years.

05:09.000 --> 05:14.000
There was this awesome fast company article about you, and I've seen you say this in videos

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
where you were shockingly calculating when starting your last company, L2.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.000
I think you said something like Deloitte did a study.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.000
They did a study that shows what's the difference between the people who sell their companies

05:24.000 --> 05:28.000
for five to ten times revenue versus those who just sell it for one or two times.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.000
And you had these like four or five things, and it was, they own a niche, they have recurring revenue,

05:33.000 --> 05:39.000
tech is at their core, and that they're international, and then finally they have defensive IP.

05:39.000 --> 05:43.000
And then you went on and said how like in your 40s, when you were starting L2, 40s and 50s,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
you were like only focused on money.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
You said, I worked my ass off, I was there at the office at 2 a.m.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
You said, but I don't regret it.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
You said it was totally worth it.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
And when you were starting L2, I don't really know too much about that industry or that business

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
other than a handful of articles.

05:57.000 --> 06:01.000
Were you that calculating with working backwards from an exit?

06:01.000 --> 06:05.000
And by the way, the story ends with you selling it for $120 million.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
160, boss. Jesus, get your facts right.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
And by the way, I'm number one on Amazon today.

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I don't know if I told you that.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.000
Yeah, I didn't have a lot of money, and for me, work was about getting economic security.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I was very focused on money.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
And I'm not saying that's the right way, it was just my way.

06:25.000 --> 06:30.000
And I had done a lot of analysis in this study referring to said, okay,

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
there are companies that sell in any industry, the lowest 10 percentile,

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
the upper-desile of the valuations they get taken out at.

06:39.000 --> 06:44.000
And this study looked at the common features of the companies that got sold in the top-desile.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
And it was all the things you talked about.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
And that's literally how I shaped the business model.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
I went to the London office right away.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
I said, charging consulting fees, I said, pay me a quarter of a million bucks a year,

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
and I'll answer your toughest questions using data.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
We focused on luxury and then consumer brands.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
We broadened our niche a little bit.

07:02.000 --> 07:07.000
We spent, I raised $17 million to create a series of technology and scraping tools

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
so that I could collect more data points than anyone in the world,

07:10.000 --> 07:17.000
such that when the inevitable guy from the analytics department came in with his arms crossed to play, gotcha,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
they just couldn't argue with our data.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
We just collected more data than anyone in the world on these issues

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
and tried to distill it down to something actionable.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
So I was very focused on exit.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
And we sold for eight times revenue.

07:30.000 --> 07:36.000
So yeah, man, my basic pitch to people was, you're going to work your ass off

07:36.000 --> 07:40.000
and I'm going to try and get you to, you know,

07:40.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm going to try and get you to where your parents were 20 years earlier.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.000
And if you're looking for balance, this isn't that place.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.000
If you're really into management or other things, tell me,

07:50.000 --> 07:55.000
and I will try and shape a role around what's important to you.

07:55.000 --> 08:01.000
But we are a small business going all in to try and create economic security for us and our families.

08:01.000 --> 08:04.000
With Prop Team Media, we're about 14 people now.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
I purposely didn't take outside capital.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.000
I'm not on that hamster wheel again.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
I'm not trying to, Jones for an exit,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.000
I'm trying to build something interesting that has relevance,

08:14.000 --> 08:17.000
that has a little bit more impact on the social issues we think about

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
and also pair people really well.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
I used to pay people below market and give them equity

08:21.000 --> 08:24.000
and I was throwing nickels around like there are manhole covers

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
because I wanted to have a profitable company I could sell.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Now my priorities have changed.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And the people who joined the company, I tell them,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
this isn't the kind of company that gets sold.

08:33.000 --> 08:39.000
But what I'll do is I'll share, I'll give you equity or participation in my book deals.

08:39.000 --> 08:45.000
You are a junior analyst, you get one or two percent of any book deal I get.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
Try and create some economic upside for them.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
My natural starting point is that people come to work

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
to develop economic security for them and their families,

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
to increase their currency, their currency and the marketplace experience

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
and also to develop relationships.

09:01.000 --> 09:06.000
The workplace is a great place to meet friends, mentors, additional co-founders.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
And we spend a lot of money on, we saved, with COVID we gave up our office,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
we save about $800,000 or $900,000 a year on an office

09:14.000 --> 09:19.000
because of course as a narcissist I had to have this amazing office in Soho, which was stupid.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
And I have this rule at work, or not this rule, but this benefit.

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
If any four of them are together, they get my credit card.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.000
They can go to Broadway or they can go to Tulum.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
And they've done those things without asking my permission.

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
As long as there's four of them, they got my credit card.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
And the number one source of retention,

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
I think the key to building a small business is retention because if you find good people,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
you just don't want them to be with you a year or two years and go to Google

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
because the switching costs are enormous.

09:46.000 --> 09:50.000
And if you find someone good, your job as an entrepreneur or the CEO

09:50.000 --> 09:52.000
is just to create an environment where they want to stick.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.000
Retention of employees, in my opinion, is just huge.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
And I find, or I read a study, another study on this,

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
and it said the number one source of retention or the number one lever for retention,

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
people think it's compensation, people think it's culture.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
It's whether or not that person has a friend at work.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.000
If they have a friend at work, they look forward to going to work

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
and they are less likely to leave.

10:14.000 --> 10:18.000
And so what I try and do, everybody interviews everybody when we hire people,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
but these kids, it's really inspiring.

10:20.000 --> 10:24.000
They'll go, like six of them will go on vacation together.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
They'll say, oh, Scott, you're speaking in Hamburg, Germany.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
All six of us are going to come.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
And they have a great time together.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
They're like each other.

10:31.000 --> 10:35.000
And it's really, it's a powerful kind of business weapon, if you will.

10:35.000 --> 10:41.000
Now, I don't think you can do that when it's a company scales beyond 50, 100 people.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
But I found for a small business, it's really powerful.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
Hey, real quick, as you know, we're big on ideas here.

10:47.000 --> 10:51.000
We love bringing new ideas, business ideas, brainstorming ideas for the podcast.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Well, a lot of people ask, what do you do with all those ideas?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Can we go find them?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Is there a list somewhere?

10:55.000 --> 10:58.000
The great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
It's totally free.

10:59.000 --> 11:03.000
If you just click the link to the description below, you can go download a collection of

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.000
And so what are you waiting for?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
Go download it.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
It's free.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Check it out.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.000
It's in the description below.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
All right.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
Back to the show.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
And is the trick there that you don't try to be their friend?

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Because I've had that problem before.

11:17.000 --> 11:21.000
I wanted to be the friend and that made the management a little bit messy.

11:21.000 --> 11:25.000
And I realized it is much better for me to not be the friend and not be included in the

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
hangs.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
The whole company functions better.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.000
Even personally, I was like, oh man, they're all going out without me.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.000
But actually it was far better that it went that way.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.000
I always had a healthy sense of what the border was.

11:40.000 --> 11:47.000
Me and my president and my committee and the partner at L2, we're both about the same age

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
and we have the same view.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
We have parties all the time.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
We show up early.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
As soon as shit starts getting a little like crazy, we leave.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yeah.

11:57.000 --> 12:01.000
A, we don't need to see them drunk.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
They definitely don't need to see me drunk.

12:04.000 --> 12:10.000
And my attitude is what you're saying, Sean, is really interesting.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.000
And that is I'm just coming to the realization as a dad.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.000
I'm not their friend.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
I'm their dad.

12:17.000 --> 12:21.000
Because it was really upsetting to me that my kids did kind of, I don't want to say I

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
don't want to be my friend, but I just naturally assumed that my kids would adore me and be

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
really into World War II history and CrossFit because that's what dad is into.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
And guess what?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
They're not.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
And what I realized is I'm not their friend.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
I'm there to be their dad.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.000
And it's kind of the same way I think I work with such young people.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
I think the average age is probably 30 or 34 because I'm there.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
But the median is like 25.

12:45.000 --> 12:50.000
It's basically a bunch of kids, overeducated, super ambitious kids.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
And it's easy.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
They're doing dinner and drink somewhere.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
I show up for dinner.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I leave before dessert.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.000
And then they can, you know, they can enjoy each other without thinking they're being judged

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
by Scott.

13:02.000 --> 13:09.000
So yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't, I draw sharp relief between, you know, work and

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
fun with those guys.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
I love it.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.000
I go out with them, but I go out for the first couple hours and then I disappear so they

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
can, they can have their own son.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
I love the four of you together.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
You get my card.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
That's amazing little tidbit.

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
I'm, I'm here to collect little lessons learned from you today.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
And that's, that's one immediate one for me.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Thanks mom.

13:28.000 --> 13:32.000
So like, obviously you're kind of, you're, I don't, I don't know if you're at the peak,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
but you're, you're at, you're killing it right now in terms of your pod and kind of

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
being a public figure in the books and everything.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
And then before that you had the company.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
So you had a huge financial outcome.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.000
One of the things that I think it's kind of brushed over in your history is what you

13:46.000 --> 13:48.000
were doing with kind of being an activist investor.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I know you were on the board of New York times and you made a few other like pretty like

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
substantial investments.

13:53.000 --> 13:56.000
I know you were working with a hedge fund to do that.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
What were some of the deals that you were doing?

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
What were some of the kind of the best deals?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.000
What were some of the worst deals?

14:01.000 --> 14:05.000
What were some of the signals that you had where you were like, this is an interesting

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
deal.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
I should pounce on this.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Sure.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
So there's a bit of a backstory there.

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I started coming to go rent envelope and went public.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
I was on the board.

14:12.000 --> 14:17.000
I got into a fight with arguably the most successful venture capitalist in the world.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
Spoiler alert.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
He won the fight.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
I was kicked off the board.

14:20.000 --> 14:24.000
So I was kicked out of the band that I started, which was like emotionally and mentally very

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
taxing for me.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
And then I got angry.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
I was a really weird time in my life.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
My mom was dying and I moved in with her.

14:31.000 --> 14:35.000
And during the day I would take manager health care at night.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
She was living in Vegas.

14:36.000 --> 14:43.000
I'd go to downtown and get shitty drunk with strippers and quote unquote friends and then

14:43.000 --> 14:47.000
go back and manage my mom's health care and watch everyone loves Raymond and Jeopardy with

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
my mom.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.000
It was a strange time in my life.

14:49.000 --> 14:53.660
I was also very angry because I'd just been kicked off the board of rent envelope.

14:53.660 --> 14:57.320
So I took a half a million dollars in my money and I filed a proxy to replace the entire

14:57.320 --> 14:59.080
board.

14:59.080 --> 15:02.680
And I learned everything about activist investing and shareholder governance.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.000
And I tried to kick everyone off the board.

15:06.000 --> 15:10.880
And I own 10% of the company and I think I got 12% of the vote and my proxy solicitor

15:10.880 --> 15:12.680
said that 2% was probably a mistake.

15:12.680 --> 15:16.680
So basically no one voted for my slate and that was kind of a low moment for me.

15:16.680 --> 15:17.680
Okay.

15:17.680 --> 15:23.480
The world has told me they don't want me involved in this corporation or in public companies.

15:23.480 --> 15:28.800
And then six months later, I got a call from a hedge fund that said, you're crazy, but you

15:28.800 --> 15:29.840
are kind of crazy.

15:29.840 --> 15:35.560
We have some stakes in companies and we need someone to kind of go in and rattle the cage.

15:35.560 --> 15:41.040
And it just struck me that at your lowest moment, you really don't know where that might lead.

15:41.040 --> 15:43.360
And I got backed.

15:43.360 --> 15:47.360
I went into a company called, I bought 10% of a company called United Retail, which was

15:47.360 --> 15:48.560
a plus size clothing brand.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.960
I basically showed up and said, let me build your website.

15:51.960 --> 15:52.960
You don't have a website.

15:52.960 --> 15:55.720
This was a while ago where I'm going to try and replace the board.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.200
This had fine.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.560
Stock went from two to eight and I'm like, wow, this is easy.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.520
And I did it at Sharper Image, bought a big stake there, went in there.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.240
The company seemed like a mess.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.240
Stock had gone up a little bit.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.240
I got out.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.240
I did it at Gateway Computer.

16:09.240 --> 16:10.240
Went on the board there.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.240
That was more difficult.

16:11.240 --> 16:14.520
We made a small amount of money, but I'd never lost money doing it.

16:14.520 --> 16:17.720
So then I went and raised $700 million and became the largest shareholder in the New

16:17.720 --> 16:20.640
York Times and went on the board there.

16:20.640 --> 16:21.640
And timing is everything.

16:21.640 --> 16:26.040
And in this case, I went on the board in March of 2008.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.520
And the stock went from 16 to three in about five months.

16:29.520 --> 16:34.640
At one point, I think I was losing $10 or $12 million of other people's money every day.

16:34.640 --> 16:36.160
And we almost lost the business.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.160
The company almost went bankrupt.

16:37.160 --> 16:42.480
I don't know if you guys remember that, but in the world of media, people just stopped

16:42.480 --> 16:43.480
advertising.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.480
They just stopped.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.840
It was like our tap of revenue just got turned off.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.080
And it was sort of the great financial recession.

16:51.080 --> 16:55.400
It kind of ended my career as an activism because one, I don't think I was very good

16:55.400 --> 16:56.400
at it.

16:56.400 --> 17:01.000
And two, I was getting to a stage in my life where I just didn't want to be combative anymore.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.040
I didn't want to go to war with CEOs.

17:03.040 --> 17:07.360
I was just exhausted by being an antagonist.

17:07.360 --> 17:11.720
I thought, I'm never going to go on a board again unless the CEO wants me there.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
But I did that for a while.

17:12.720 --> 17:13.720
I learned a lot.

17:13.720 --> 17:19.240
I made a little bit of money, but I was in my early 40s and quite frankly, just trying

17:19.240 --> 17:23.000
to figure out a way to make a living so I could stay in New York, which isn't easy.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.800
And I think I was flailing a little bit, but it was a great experience.

17:28.800 --> 17:33.200
I learned a lot about human nature, about shareholders, about governance.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.320
I get called a lot by boards when they're being challenged by an activist because I

17:36.320 --> 17:37.320
was one.

17:37.320 --> 17:40.200
And I think I have some insight into how these people think.

17:40.200 --> 17:47.040
But yeah, it was just a strange time in my life, but it was interesting.

17:47.040 --> 17:48.040
It was fun.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.640
I just wasn't very good at it.

17:49.640 --> 17:50.640
Yeah, that's cool.

17:50.640 --> 17:53.960
I had a bunch of different careers and I like that.

17:53.960 --> 17:54.960
I like variety.

17:54.960 --> 17:58.320
I like people who have different chapters and sagas of their life.

17:58.320 --> 18:02.080
And you mentioned your 20s are for figuring out what you actually like to do or what you're

18:02.080 --> 18:05.160
actually good at or the intersection between those two.

18:05.160 --> 18:11.840
It sounds like yours went past your 20s and you just kept experimenting along the way.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.720
Is that a fair assessment for you?

18:14.720 --> 18:17.240
Yeah, investment banking, no good at it.

18:17.240 --> 18:22.960
Human School started a brand strategy firm called Profit, grew it to a couple hundred

18:22.960 --> 18:25.400
people, sold it for $33 million.

18:25.400 --> 18:26.400
What do I want to do?

18:26.400 --> 18:28.640
I know I want to teach.

18:28.640 --> 18:35.200
The .com implosion took me from what I thought was being wealthy to not being wealthy.

18:35.200 --> 18:39.520
Teaching wasn't going to help me maintain the lifestyle I needed or wanted to maintain

18:39.520 --> 18:44.360
with two young kids in New York, so I needed to find other ways to make money.

18:44.360 --> 18:49.640
I did the hedge fund thing for a while, did boards, and then saw an opportunity in analytics

18:49.640 --> 18:55.720
and benchmarking and started that company, I think O9 or O10, and that was my big win.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.120
And the timing is everything.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.720
I got swept up into what is the greatest bull market economy in history.

19:00.720 --> 19:05.800
08 to present is probably going to go down as the greatest extended bull market run

19:05.800 --> 19:07.440
in history.

19:07.440 --> 19:12.480
People don't understand just what an anomaly the last 16 years have been relative to the

19:12.480 --> 19:14.560
history of the market.

19:14.560 --> 19:22.320
And just as I was coming into my prime income earning years, the wins just filled up my sales.

19:22.320 --> 19:27.240
And I finally got all the moons sort of lined up, if you will.

19:27.240 --> 19:34.520
But I've always said, you got to be humble when things work because a lot of your success

19:34.520 --> 19:36.040
isn't your fault.

19:36.040 --> 19:41.400
At the same time, I wish I had been more forgiving of myself when things didn't work

19:41.400 --> 19:43.820
because I have trouble forgiving myself.

19:43.820 --> 19:49.000
I struggle with anger, and the person I get most angry at is myself, and I have trouble

19:49.000 --> 19:52.000
getting past shit.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.480
I was at a book thing last night, and I said something, and it just came out wrong, and

19:55.480 --> 19:58.640
I'm sitting in bed, and I can't get past that one thing.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.240
It went really well, but I can't think that way.

20:01.240 --> 20:04.320
I focus on what's wrong.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.400
And that would be my advice to people is be humble when you have wins because a lot of

20:08.400 --> 20:14.200
it isn't you, but also forgive yourself because, again, a lot of it isn't you.

20:14.200 --> 20:19.120
My roommate in college had the poem If by I think Richard Kipling on his wall, and one

20:19.120 --> 20:24.680
of the great lines of that poem is, if you can meet triumph and disaster and treat those

20:24.680 --> 20:28.320
two imposters just the same, and that's always stuck with me.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.920
That's kind of what you're talking about.

20:29.920 --> 20:35.360
Your greatest triumphs, maintaining the humility, and then in your greatest failures, not beating

20:35.360 --> 20:37.560
yourself up too much.

20:37.560 --> 20:42.560
You're a big proponent of stoicism, and that seems like a pretty stoic way to be.

20:42.560 --> 20:46.480
Give us the like, there's a lot of people listening to this right now that may be familiar

20:46.480 --> 20:51.040
with stoicism, don't practice, don't kind of know how it applies to their life.

20:51.040 --> 20:52.040
Make your pitch.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.880
Why stoicism matters to somebody?

20:54.880 --> 20:59.960
Well, just your own mental and emotional health, and Ryan Holiday is kind of my Yoda

20:59.960 --> 21:02.320
on stoicism, and he distills it this way.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.240
Life is not about what happens to you.

21:04.240 --> 21:09.320
You can't control that, but you can't control how you respond to what happens to you.

21:09.320 --> 21:17.320
And I've tried to always remember that, and I have trouble practicing it, but the ultimate

21:17.320 --> 21:22.720
stoicism piece of art in modern history or modern media is Brokeback Mountain.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.680
If you can't fix it, you've got to stand it.

21:25.680 --> 21:31.080
And that is try and focus on the things you can control, and you can control your emotions.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.440
It's very difficult to control what happens to you.

21:34.440 --> 21:42.280
And just also recognize, and this is more atheism than stoicism, everyone on this podcast,

21:42.280 --> 21:46.560
everyone we know, everyone we care about, what they think of us, they're going to be

21:46.560 --> 21:49.600
dead in a hundred years.

21:49.600 --> 21:56.120
In a blink of the history, nothing you say or do or what anyone else thinks of you is

21:56.120 --> 22:00.880
going to matter for very long, and something that really has helped me when I was embarrassed

22:00.880 --> 22:05.440
or I thought I didn't equip myself very well is what you realize is just imagine yourself

22:05.440 --> 22:10.920
when someone says or does something stupid, you think to yourself, oh, that was stupid.

22:10.920 --> 22:14.280
And then you go back to thinking about yourself.

22:14.280 --> 22:19.520
And people aren't thinking about you, your wealth, your failures, your successes as much

22:19.520 --> 22:21.040
as you are.

22:21.040 --> 22:24.600
And so the key is just trying to be comfortable with yourself and comfortable in your own

22:24.600 --> 22:25.600
skin.

22:25.600 --> 22:30.320
And not only that, really kind of focus on what your spouse thinks of you.

22:30.360 --> 22:31.360
Is your spouse happy?

22:31.360 --> 22:34.160
Do you have a good relationship with your kids?

22:34.160 --> 22:36.280
Because what Twitter thinks of you really isn't that important.

22:36.280 --> 22:42.400
And because I had so much trouble actually footing my emotions to that logical notion,

22:42.400 --> 22:46.760
I know it doesn't matter what people on Twitter or the Twitter mob think of me, but I couldn't

22:46.760 --> 22:49.040
emotionally separate myself from it.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.160
I don't have those skills.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.400
So a role model of mine is again, Sam Harris.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.000
He's like, oh, I got off Twitter.

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
I can't handle that.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.520
He's like, why don't you get off of Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I can.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.320
So I stopped, I'm off of Twitter for the last nine months and it's been one of the most

23:03.320 --> 23:06.120
accretive things to my mental health.

23:06.120 --> 23:09.080
And I didn't like to admit this, but I would say five or six weekends where I just got

23:09.080 --> 23:12.680
really bummed out by something, probably two or three of them started on Twitter.

23:12.680 --> 23:20.480
I thought, why am I on something that's making me on a regular basis upset?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.720
And there's an addictive nature to it.

23:22.720 --> 23:24.760
I think it must be just, and that's what freaks me out.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.280
I can modulate it.

23:26.280 --> 23:28.840
You know, can my 13 year old son?

23:29.160 --> 23:32.960
Do I even know that he's upset when he goes, we have a rule in my house that our boys

23:32.960 --> 23:35.360
aren't allowed to go into their rooms or their phones alone?

23:35.360 --> 23:39.960
Because I think this thing can literally take a teenager, especially a teenager girl, down

23:39.960 --> 23:44.760
a rabbit hole and kind of zero to 60 really fast and then start serving her content.

23:44.760 --> 23:47.240
Oh, you're worried about dieting?

23:47.240 --> 23:51.960
Well, here's extreme dieting tips, despite the fact we know you're 5'10", 95 pounds.

23:51.960 --> 23:53.440
Oh, you're depressed?

23:53.440 --> 23:56.280
Well, here are some videos of people considering suicide.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.800
We're going to normalize it for you.

23:58.800 --> 24:03.440
And I don't think parents are really in touch with just how ugly and how fast it gets really

24:03.440 --> 24:04.440
ugly.

24:04.440 --> 24:11.480
So, you know, I'm trying to be very thoughtful about what it is as a stoicism, controlling

24:11.480 --> 24:17.000
what I can't control, and then trying to be in better touch with my emotions and recognize

24:17.000 --> 24:23.040
that when you're down, it's more about the chemistry in your head than any legitimate

24:23.040 --> 24:24.440
reason to be down.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.200
You're going to look at the end of life, the biggest regrets.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.960
My colleague at NYU, Adam Alter, did great research on people who are very near death

24:31.960 --> 24:34.080
and palliative care.

24:34.080 --> 24:37.560
And their biggest regrets are one, they'd wish they'd stayed in better touch with friends.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.440
They wish they'd lived the life they wanted to lead, not the life society or their parents

24:41.440 --> 24:43.360
wanted them to lead.

24:43.360 --> 24:47.760
Their biggest regret is they wish they'd been less hard on themselves.

24:47.760 --> 24:49.040
They wish they'd forgiven themselves.

24:49.040 --> 24:53.200
They wish they'd allowed themselves to be happy.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.880
And that's kind of been, that's something I've been very focused on.

24:55.880 --> 24:59.120
It's like, okay, stop beating yourself up, you're going to be dead soon.

24:59.120 --> 25:05.800
Why wouldn't you squeeze as much juice out of this lemon as conceivable and like afford

25:05.800 --> 25:10.080
yourself the opportunity to be happy and be sad if you need to be.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.880
But I think of stoicism as, again, life isn't about what happens to you, it's how you respond

25:13.880 --> 25:19.600
to what happens to you and decide what is in your control and, you know, try and be

25:19.600 --> 25:22.840
good to yourself, try and forgive yourself and also just try and be humble.

25:22.840 --> 25:28.400
You are never more prone to a really big mistake than right after a big win.

25:28.400 --> 25:33.060
Because here's the thing, you start thinking you're good at picking stocks.

25:33.060 --> 25:36.920
You start thinking you're so skilled at work, it wasn't that someone senior to you took

25:36.920 --> 25:39.200
an interest in you and championed you.

25:39.200 --> 25:40.920
You start thinking, oh, I'm great at real estate.

25:40.920 --> 25:45.080
I just didn't get lucky and buy a home at the right time.

25:45.080 --> 25:51.600
So be, try and just try and ignore the market when the market tells you you're a failure.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.600
And this is personal, too.

25:52.600 --> 25:56.160
You know, there's been moments in my life where I thought, I don't think I'm ever going

25:56.160 --> 25:57.560
to be able to work again.

25:57.560 --> 26:00.600
I think I've ruined everything.

26:00.600 --> 26:03.080
I don't think I'm ever going to make a very good living.

26:03.080 --> 26:07.880
I remember thinking, saying to my partner at the time, let's move to a low-cost neighborhood,

26:07.880 --> 26:09.720
a Charlottesville or a Raleigh Derm.

26:09.720 --> 26:13.800
I'm going to teach, try and write, you know, make decent livings and just have a really

26:13.800 --> 26:14.800
nice life.

26:14.800 --> 26:16.320
And my partner's like, that's giving up.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.360
I'm like, well, it's not giving up, but I thought this is it.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.000
I just need to substantially downgrade my expectations.

26:22.000 --> 26:25.600
And I don't mean to say that that's not a great life.

26:25.600 --> 26:30.520
I remember thinking after my divorce, like, I don't think I'm ever going to have someone

26:30.520 --> 26:32.360
who I can share my life with again.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.960
I'm like, this just is never going to happen to me.

26:34.960 --> 26:39.920
I'm an unattractive, broken man who's never going to find like a partner again.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.920
I believe that for a short time.

26:42.920 --> 26:48.640
And I think that it's important that everybody recognize that, you know, you are the answer

26:48.640 --> 26:50.520
to a firm's problem.

26:50.520 --> 26:54.800
You can find someone who you can love and is going to love you a great deal.

26:54.800 --> 26:59.360
The key is getting up, putting in yourself in a place of success, getting out of the

26:59.360 --> 27:06.480
house, being friendly, being risk aggressive, surrounding yourself with people and exercise

27:06.480 --> 27:11.320
and nutrition that makes you feel good about yourself, such that when the winds kick up

27:11.320 --> 27:13.200
again, your sales are up.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.240
And I've always tried to do that.

27:15.240 --> 27:20.040
I've had a lot of failure, but I was always had my sales up, such that when the winds

27:20.040 --> 27:25.480
kicked up again, I was in a position to rumble, so to speak, because I know a lot of people

27:25.480 --> 27:31.240
who are very successful and then they hit some failure, a personal failure, a death of a parent

27:31.240 --> 27:37.520
they can't quite get over, a divorce, a company that fails, and they get stuck.

27:37.520 --> 27:39.880
They can't forgive themselves.

27:39.880 --> 27:41.040
They can't forgive others.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.120
They can't forgive the market.

27:44.120 --> 27:50.320
Or they lose their mojo, whatever it is, and two, three, five years, seven years goes

27:50.320 --> 27:53.360
on and they just haven't progressed.

27:53.360 --> 27:55.160
And they start, their skills start atrophying.

27:55.160 --> 27:57.680
Their confidence starts atrophying.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.520
So what I say is put a statute of limit.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.520
Whenever anything bad happens to you, you got to put a statute of limitations on it.

28:03.520 --> 28:08.920
A parent dies, you know, within 12 weeks, you should still be sad and thinking about

28:08.920 --> 28:13.000
your parents, but you should be able to, you should be able to function.

28:13.000 --> 28:16.520
You know, you go through a real emotional trauma or a breakup, well, how serious was

28:16.520 --> 28:17.520
it?

28:17.520 --> 28:18.520
How much time?

28:18.520 --> 28:19.520
What's the statute of limitations?

28:19.520 --> 28:23.480
A business goes out of business, okay, mourn for a little while.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.480
What is that?

28:24.480 --> 28:25.480
Two months?

28:25.480 --> 28:26.480
Three months?

28:26.480 --> 28:30.760
But if you are better, if you are back sending out emails, trying to raise money, going out

28:30.760 --> 28:35.260
trying to meet new people, whatever it might be within that timeline, you need to reach

28:35.260 --> 28:39.020
out for help and get unstuck.

28:39.020 --> 28:45.460
Because time goes really fast and your skills atrophy in a sort of a downward spiral.

28:45.460 --> 28:48.140
And something I've always been able to do is mourn and move on.

28:48.140 --> 28:51.420
Churchill said the key to success is the ability to move through failure without losing your

28:51.420 --> 28:52.920
sense of enthusiasm.

28:52.920 --> 28:57.900
And I've tried, I've been pretty good at not losing my sense of enthusiasm.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.580
You're, you know, you've got brilliant ideas.

29:01.580 --> 29:05.940
I think you're a good business person, but you talk about not just following your passion,

29:05.940 --> 29:06.940
but your talent.

29:06.940 --> 29:09.900
And I think that what you're most talented at is communication.

29:09.900 --> 29:14.500
I've seen you speak live, I've seen you, I listened to the pod, I've seen your videos.

29:14.500 --> 29:20.300
You do such a good job at picking really sharp words and sharp phrases and just small examples

29:20.300 --> 29:21.300
like accoutrement.

29:21.300 --> 29:25.180
I've noticed that you love that word and I've never heard anyone use it as much as you.

29:25.180 --> 29:26.340
And I'm like, oh, I love that word.

29:26.340 --> 29:28.740
The one who uses that word, it's a beautiful word.

29:28.740 --> 29:32.020
Or you sign your emails with, uh, uh, life is rich.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.460
Like you've, you've got beautiful phrases.

29:34.460 --> 29:37.260
I think that, uh, I even, by the way, I even had a chat, GBT, right?

29:37.260 --> 29:41.540
Uploaded like 150 of your blogs and I would ask it questions to like help give me like

29:41.540 --> 29:44.700
ideas for phrases because you're really good at that.

29:44.700 --> 29:48.180
Who do you steal from when it comes to, or who you inspired from when it comes to language?

29:48.180 --> 29:51.740
I mean, you seem like someone, if I had to guess, like you're a George Carlin guy, something

29:51.740 --> 29:52.740
like that.

29:52.740 --> 29:56.780
Who do you steal like some of your delivery from or inspired by for writing because you're

29:56.780 --> 29:57.780
really good.

29:57.780 --> 30:01.180
And do you have like a, a bank of like, when you see a phrase, you're like, Oh, I'm going

30:01.180 --> 30:03.100
to take that phrase and use that somewhere.

30:03.100 --> 30:07.580
If you don't have a kitchen cabinet of people that you learn enough about that you can mimic

30:07.580 --> 30:09.580
them, you're trying to play a team sport.

30:09.580 --> 30:14.220
So, uh, you're on the field alone and I didn't figure that out till I was older.

30:14.220 --> 30:19.620
So I absolutely, when I see something inspiring, I breathe maybe one book a year.

30:19.620 --> 30:20.620
People think I'm well read.

30:20.620 --> 30:23.340
I'm not, but I'll find a book that's really meaningful and I'll try and read it two or

30:23.340 --> 30:26.380
three times so I can adopt it into my gray matter.

30:26.980 --> 30:30.420
Daniel Kahneman's thinking slow and fast.

30:30.420 --> 30:34.420
I've read that book a few times and I know everything about loss aversion theory.

30:34.420 --> 30:37.340
I know a lot about the relationship between money and happiness.

30:37.340 --> 30:39.900
I read observations of a bite standard by Peter Drucker.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.980
I read Sapient several times.

30:42.980 --> 30:49.060
I want to like really, really, you know, embed stuff lately I'd write down things in my phone

30:49.060 --> 30:54.860
that I just think are fucking hilarious, like jokes, you know, I wrote down something today

30:54.860 --> 30:58.060
as a prank when my doctor walks in, I put on gloves.

30:58.060 --> 30:59.180
I'm going to try that.

30:59.180 --> 31:00.180
I love my doctor.

31:00.180 --> 31:05.460
I love the idea of him walking in and me snapping on gloves just to see his reaction.

31:05.460 --> 31:09.780
We were talking about Trump today and I saw this great quote that said consequences rarely

31:09.780 --> 31:11.080
show up lubed.

31:11.080 --> 31:12.580
I love that.

31:12.580 --> 31:18.540
Um, I just, whenever I see something that really, I just think, you know, I love going

31:18.540 --> 31:21.420
out in the public, except for the fact that the public is there.

31:21.420 --> 31:25.780
You see these things every day and I will write them down and incorporate them into

31:25.780 --> 31:31.420
my rap and especially great phrases, you know, greatness is in the agency of others.

31:31.420 --> 31:34.940
I remember my VC said that I'm like, that just makes so much goddamn sense.

31:34.940 --> 31:38.420
I'm going to use that over and over and over.

31:38.420 --> 31:41.020
So I have a lot of inspiration.

31:41.020 --> 31:44.380
Um, I surround myself with really intelligent young people.

31:44.380 --> 31:48.100
I know that's ages, but I think young people have a different frame on things that help

31:48.100 --> 31:49.100
me.

31:49.700 --> 31:54.300
So, but to not, to not sort of, if you're just reading something and not, you don't

31:54.300 --> 31:56.700
take away stuff you're going to remember, you haven't really read it.

31:56.700 --> 32:00.620
You haven't really absorbed it, but it's all, all manner of stuff.

32:00.620 --> 32:03.580
I think, um, um, you're, you're right.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.180
I'm totally inspired by George Carlin.

32:05.180 --> 32:06.780
I think he's fantastic on society.

32:06.780 --> 32:10.300
I've been inspired by Ricky Treve, so I'm inspired by this comedian named Michelle

32:10.300 --> 32:11.300
Wolf.

32:11.300 --> 32:16.140
I think she's fantastic, but yeah, I've read a lot about Muhammad Ali.

32:16.140 --> 32:20.660
I think he's, you know, be courageous, be poetic, but yeah, absolutely every young

32:20.660 --> 32:24.820
person should find a couple of people they find really inspiring and try and learn everything

32:24.820 --> 32:30.380
about them and what they said, such that you can kind of turn on your Muhammad Ali.

32:30.380 --> 32:34.700
And you know, Madeleine Albright, secretary of state, you know, four foot 10, I find her

32:34.700 --> 32:40.340
inspiring around pub policy or so on geopolitics, so I've read a lot about her.

32:40.340 --> 32:43.620
Our, you know, our memory is long and our reach is far.

32:43.620 --> 32:44.620
I love that.

32:44.620 --> 32:48.460
She used to say that about America to its enemies, right?

32:48.460 --> 32:52.220
Basically a really eloquent way of saying, don't fuck with us boys.

32:52.220 --> 32:58.580
And I just love that this four 10 woman only in America can wield, you know, the most powerful

32:58.580 --> 33:01.260
nation in the world in terms of our foreign policy abroad.

33:01.260 --> 33:02.580
And I found her and she was an immigrant.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.900
I just found her inspiring, so I wanted to learn more about her so I could be her on

33:05.900 --> 33:06.900
occasion.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.300
Anyways, yeah, build a kitchen cabinet of people.

33:09.740 --> 33:14.740
It's got, I got a, my notes app here, it's called funny phrases and I just, I collect

33:14.740 --> 33:15.740
these.

33:15.740 --> 33:17.820
I'll give you, I'll give you three of my funny phrases on here because they're completely

33:17.820 --> 33:18.820
out of context.

33:18.820 --> 33:21.940
So you won't get it, but you'll get it because you do sounds like you do this too.

33:21.940 --> 33:25.500
When somebody's thick, you could say that they're built like a baguette.

33:25.500 --> 33:26.500
I like that.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.660
Somebody's got the body of a baguette.

33:28.660 --> 33:31.260
Okay, next one.

33:31.260 --> 33:35.580
If you want to talk about something that other people are avoiding, you say, look, I'm

33:35.580 --> 33:37.860
going to address this like an envelope right now.

33:38.860 --> 33:39.660
That's a dad joke.

33:41.340 --> 33:48.060
Another one would be for CEOs who have bad, you know, a terrible sense of vision of the

33:48.060 --> 33:49.060
future.

33:49.060 --> 33:53.340
If this CEO was the shooter at JFK, he would have died of natural causes.

33:53.340 --> 33:56.300
I love these little, little isms, little phrases, little sentences.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.780
You're going to lose this game.

33:57.780 --> 34:02.540
Okay, so he looks like a suicide bomber that's having second thoughts.

34:05.620 --> 34:06.500
This is more serious.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.500
I absolutely, I absolutely love this one.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.340
This is more true life advice.

34:11.340 --> 34:15.340
Your goal isn't to get the apology, but to forgive the perceived debt.

34:15.340 --> 34:16.500
I love that.

34:16.500 --> 34:17.500
I love that.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.860
Just think down, this is really bad.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.220
Teaching my son about sex ads.

34:23.220 --> 34:26.500
So I walked into his room with a banana in a condom and he said, what's the banana for?

34:26.500 --> 34:31.060
And I said, I can't get hard on an empty stomach.

34:31.060 --> 34:34.300
I literally think that's the funniest fucking.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.540
That just hit Sam.

34:35.540 --> 34:37.300
I literally just hit Sam.

34:37.300 --> 34:42.300
I just think that's so inappropriate and so anyways, sorry guys.

34:42.300 --> 34:45.700
All right, I'm not going to, this is like getting into a rap battle with Tupac.

34:45.700 --> 34:48.180
I'm not, I'm not going to, I'm going to put away my swipe file right here, even though

34:48.180 --> 34:49.180
I just had a good one.

34:49.180 --> 34:50.180
There you go.

34:50.180 --> 34:51.180
I'm going to give up.

34:51.180 --> 34:52.180
You win.

34:52.180 --> 34:54.260
What are you excited about right now?

34:54.260 --> 34:58.900
Like what are some things that are going on in the world or products or ideas or trends?

34:58.900 --> 35:02.620
Like, you know, I think you talk a lot about like, you know, stuff that's wrong with America,

35:02.620 --> 35:05.420
with the world, culture, with society, but I want to know the opposite.

35:05.420 --> 35:06.940
What are you, what are you pumped about?

35:06.940 --> 35:07.940
That's not easier for me.

35:07.940 --> 35:11.100
I mean, to be blunt, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy.

35:11.100 --> 35:13.260
I think a lot about loneliness.

35:13.260 --> 35:14.780
I think a lot about struggling young men.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.900
I think about the threats of AI.

35:17.900 --> 35:18.900
What am I excited about?

35:18.900 --> 35:22.780
I have a work with a really talented group of people that are really inspiring.

35:22.780 --> 35:24.700
I love the work we're doing.

35:24.700 --> 35:27.260
I mean, I just really enjoy it.

35:27.260 --> 35:29.100
I get to travel a lot with my kids.

35:29.100 --> 35:34.660
I got kids that are at a great age and I get to do a ton of fun stuff with them.

35:34.660 --> 35:36.980
It's really intoxicating.

35:36.980 --> 35:42.060
You know, I'm just, I get to have a really nice life at this point and I'm just enjoying

35:42.060 --> 35:48.860
it with a partner, just really leaning into my kids, you know, just the hallmark shit.

35:48.860 --> 35:55.620
I'm just really having a nice time with the people closest to me and I'm healthy.

35:55.620 --> 36:00.420
I got good, healthy kids, you know, the boring stuff, man.

36:00.420 --> 36:04.620
It's not anything kind of, I mean, I'm going, I'm on my book tour.

36:04.620 --> 36:09.020
This week I go to LA for Bill Maher and then I'm meeting a bunch of college buddies and

36:09.020 --> 36:13.380
I'm going to stagecoach and then I go to Miami for a bunch of speaking gigs and then I go

36:13.380 --> 36:14.380
home to London.

36:14.380 --> 36:19.220
I mean, I just have a, I have a really nice life right now and everyone I care about is

36:19.220 --> 36:20.840
healthy.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.100
I feel relevant.

36:22.100 --> 36:26.180
So I just have such a wonderful life and I'm trying to slow time down so I can really

36:26.180 --> 36:31.780
appreciate it because, you know, there's no getting around it.

36:31.780 --> 36:38.460
I had lunch with Ted Sarandos, which I realized is a name drop, but I'm desperate for your

36:38.460 --> 36:43.660
guys' affirmation, but his wife wrote a book on grief and there's this great line, she

36:43.660 --> 36:49.980
has this great line and that is grief is love's receipts and I just love that.

36:49.980 --> 36:53.700
I just, if you really care about, I didn't have a lot of grief until the age of 40 and

36:53.700 --> 36:56.340
I realized it was because there was no one in my life that I really loved or really loved

36:56.340 --> 36:58.900
me other than my mom.

36:58.900 --> 37:03.500
And so, you know, what I would bless or wish for anybody is they have a lot of grief in

37:03.500 --> 37:07.940
their life because what it means is they have loss and when you have loss, it's because

37:07.940 --> 37:11.300
you had something wonderful in your life and you miss it.

37:11.300 --> 37:17.660
So I'm just trying to appreciate how just nice things are and really, you know, I don't,

37:17.660 --> 37:21.460
you know, I'm not really excited about, you know, the Euro finals in Germany, although

37:21.460 --> 37:25.900
I am excited about the European finals in Germany, but I'm just, I'm just enjoying myself.

37:25.900 --> 37:27.420
And so, I'm rounding third.

37:27.420 --> 37:29.020
I have a really nice life right now.

37:29.020 --> 37:33.140
I'm just trying to enjoy it because I know everything everywhere ends.

37:33.140 --> 37:36.980
What do you say for people who are not rounding third?

37:36.980 --> 37:40.660
Like people who are, you know, just batting lead off right now.

37:40.660 --> 37:42.760
So you talk a lot to young people.

37:42.760 --> 37:47.180
One of the phrases I really liked or one of the quotes I really liked was that opportunity

37:47.180 --> 37:49.300
is a function of density.

37:49.300 --> 37:52.580
You said, yeah, get to a place that is crowded with success.

37:52.580 --> 37:53.580
What do you mean by that?

37:53.660 --> 37:55.940
Seems like really good advice for people.

37:55.940 --> 38:00.180
Well, and sort of the motivation for the book was, you know, that study that you are kind

38:00.180 --> 38:05.420
of the average of your five closest friends, that there's this weird study that peer group,

38:05.420 --> 38:08.460
the five people you hang out with, you end up being the same body mass index.

38:08.460 --> 38:11.860
You same, end up with similar political values, same jobs, same neighborhood.

38:11.860 --> 38:15.340
It means it's weird, you become the same person.

38:15.340 --> 38:18.900
What's different though with this greater variance is that of those five people, even

38:18.900 --> 38:23.140
though they make kind of similar incomes, one will end up poor, three will be okay and

38:23.140 --> 38:24.460
one will end up quite wealthy.

38:24.460 --> 38:29.220
And I tried to understand the behaviors that are different and the strategies between the

38:29.220 --> 38:36.180
person that ends up financially secure and the others that are less financially secure.

38:36.180 --> 38:39.580
And there's some general best practices around youth.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.380
You absolutely want to get to a city.

38:41.380 --> 38:44.460
If you're ambitious, I'm not suggesting this is the right way.

38:44.460 --> 38:45.460
It's just my way.

38:45.460 --> 38:48.700
If you're ambitious and you want to have influencer economic security, before you collect

38:48.700 --> 38:50.260
dogs and kids, you got to get to a city.

38:50.260 --> 38:54.260
Two thirds of economic growth is going to happen in just 20 cities.

38:54.260 --> 38:58.540
And so if you're really ambitious and get to the biggest city in your nation, then get

38:58.540 --> 39:02.300
to London if you're in Europe or New York in the U.S. or if you're in Texas, San Francisco

39:02.300 --> 39:06.620
because those cities are really competitive and you're going to be playing, you know how

39:06.620 --> 39:12.020
when you play tennis against players better than you, your game elevates.

39:12.020 --> 39:15.380
When you're in a big city, you're playing against the best players in the world.

39:15.380 --> 39:17.380
It's hard to live in Brooklyn.

39:17.380 --> 39:21.300
It's expensive, which means you got to be really good at what you do and you're surrounded

39:21.300 --> 39:25.820
by people who are going to inspire you and who are really will elevate your game.

39:25.820 --> 39:29.220
And at some point you'll probably have to move out of the city because it's difficult

39:29.220 --> 39:30.220
with kids.

39:30.220 --> 39:36.020
But while you're young, get to a big city, try and find really high character successful

39:36.020 --> 39:38.100
people to hang out with.

39:38.100 --> 39:43.300
Just find people you want to be like or that you admire professionally and personally

39:43.300 --> 39:47.740
and try and establish those friendships and try and hang out with them because you rise

39:47.740 --> 39:50.980
or fall to the level of your peer group.

39:50.980 --> 39:55.260
And the thing about cities is you're just bumping off opportunities.

39:55.260 --> 39:59.820
And I've moved to London and my reductive analysis of the U.S. versus Europe is the

39:59.820 --> 40:04.460
U.S. is still the best place to make money, Europe's the best place to spend it.

40:04.460 --> 40:08.740
So if you're in the making money part of your life, it's hard to beat the U.S. I didn't

40:08.740 --> 40:11.660
appreciate the American economy until I left it.

40:11.700 --> 40:12.860
Let's start from yesterday.

40:12.860 --> 40:13.860
How can we work together?

40:13.860 --> 40:15.660
How can we build something together?

40:15.660 --> 40:17.740
How can we make money together?

40:17.740 --> 40:21.220
London is sort of like a very polite, indefinite maybe.

40:21.220 --> 40:24.580
There's very little actual organic value creation in London.

40:24.580 --> 40:28.540
It's people servicing other people's wealth that they made elsewhere.

40:28.540 --> 40:33.820
There's nothing like America that says to a young person, if you work your ass off and

40:33.820 --> 40:39.940
you're really good and you get a little bit lucky, things can happen for you here.

40:39.980 --> 40:44.540
All my British friends, they say that they grew up being afraid of tall poppy syndrome,

40:44.540 --> 40:48.020
meaning they didn't want to stick out because their teachers would tell them, shut the hell

40:48.020 --> 40:49.660
up, get in line.

40:49.660 --> 40:54.740
Whereas in America, if you do something interesting, even if you fail, you're rewarded as being

40:54.740 --> 40:56.420
a hero of like, well, that's awesome, man.

40:56.420 --> 40:57.420
You got after it.

40:57.420 --> 41:00.540
Even if it sucked, the outcome wasn't good.

41:00.540 --> 41:02.300
We praise you for getting after it.

41:02.300 --> 41:05.540
And I think that's a very unique American thing compared to Europe.

41:05.540 --> 41:08.780
In Europe, if you stick out, you're chastised.

41:08.780 --> 41:11.940
Not only that, but people say in America, we embrace failure.

41:11.940 --> 41:12.940
That's not true.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.900
But we do tolerate it.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.180
And so only one out of seven businesses succeed.

41:18.180 --> 41:21.660
So my strategy has been to start nine businesses.

41:21.660 --> 41:24.620
And I got to two wins, and all you need is one.

41:24.620 --> 41:28.740
And if you aren't trying really hard and taking risks and failing and then knowing to pull

41:28.740 --> 41:34.140
the plug and move on, you're not taking advantage of the American embrace of risk and failure.

41:34.140 --> 41:38.900
I've never had trouble raising money because of past failures.

41:38.900 --> 41:39.900
People didn't mind that.

41:39.900 --> 41:44.100
As long as you treated your investor as well, as long as you were a decent person, you didn't

41:44.100 --> 41:47.900
do anything stupid or unethical, people don't have a problem funding you again.

41:47.900 --> 41:54.780
I've had a lot of failure professionally, but I've never had, let me put it this way,

41:54.780 --> 41:58.380
when I couldn't raise money, it wasn't because I had failed before.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.460
And that's true in relationships.

42:00.460 --> 42:05.980
So yeah, the embrace or the acceptance of failure in America is, it's singular and it's

42:05.980 --> 42:06.980
a wonderful thing.

42:06.980 --> 42:09.540
And if you aren't trying and taking a lot of riskier, you aren't taking advantage of

42:09.540 --> 42:12.660
an economy that's one of the few in the world, one of the few societies.

42:12.660 --> 42:17.540
I mean, if I was born in China, I'd probably be in jail because I'm outspoken and say stupid

42:17.540 --> 42:18.780
things.

42:18.780 --> 42:23.460
If I was born in Europe, I think I'd be a talented business person, but I wouldn't be

42:23.460 --> 42:28.460
an entrepreneur that had recognized this success because they don't embrace failure or that's

42:28.460 --> 42:29.460
wrong.

42:30.460 --> 42:33.620
Can I ask you a question about hard work?

42:33.620 --> 42:39.940
And the reason being is I found some, what read as contrary things in your work, or at

42:39.940 --> 42:42.180
least in your story and what you write.

42:42.180 --> 42:46.020
And so Sean and I have talked a lot about this, about hard work.

42:46.020 --> 42:50.380
And I think people who say they work 80 hours a week for a really long time, I think they're

42:50.380 --> 42:53.500
either lying or they did a lot of bullshit work.

42:53.500 --> 42:57.620
I think it's to work 80 hours a week for an extended period of time, it's incredibly

42:57.620 --> 42:58.620
challenging.

42:58.980 --> 43:04.140
You talked about, in this book, as well as some of the other blog posts, you're saying,

43:04.140 --> 43:10.140
in my 40s, I grinded my ass off, all I was focused on was money, and it worked out, but

43:10.140 --> 43:11.140
that's all I did.

43:11.140 --> 43:13.940
And I'm happy I did it, but it was really hard work.

43:13.940 --> 43:16.500
But then I read about how you delegate a ton.

43:16.500 --> 43:20.980
I think you said something even as crazy as you have someone pick out your clothes and

43:20.980 --> 43:22.220
you wear mostly the same thing.

43:22.220 --> 43:25.060
You have your workout outfit and then your work outfit.

43:25.060 --> 43:31.540
And how you at Prophecy Media, you said something like, you only meet with your executive producer

43:31.540 --> 43:32.540
twice a month.

43:32.540 --> 43:35.260
You only have one hour meeting once a week with the editorial team.

43:35.260 --> 43:42.020
You haven't planned vacations in 20 years, and all you do is focus on a handful of things.

43:42.020 --> 43:47.620
But even though you're crazy productive now, I don't know, are you still grinding and looking

43:47.620 --> 43:49.700
back knowing what you know now?

43:49.700 --> 43:54.340
Could you have gotten to where you've gotten without that 80 hour a week for multiple years

43:54.340 --> 43:55.340
of work ethic?

43:55.340 --> 43:57.660
Well, things have changed dramatically for me now.

43:57.660 --> 44:00.180
I'm not working nearly as hard.

44:00.180 --> 44:04.620
And I hire a lot of people and I'll over, not over hire, but everyone works hard.

44:04.620 --> 44:09.940
But I don't, I mean, when you have a small business and you don't have a lot of money,

44:09.940 --> 44:13.460
you know, you just, you got to get, everyone needs, you need to work hard.

44:13.460 --> 44:18.060
You need to set an example and you need to create an environment where everyone's working

44:18.060 --> 44:19.060
hard.

44:19.060 --> 44:21.060
I'm not sure I was ever working 80 hours a week consistently.

44:21.060 --> 44:23.620
I definitely had weeks like that.

44:23.620 --> 44:29.900
But when I look back on it, kind of, I don't know, 10, 20, 10, 15 years, I don't remember

44:29.900 --> 44:31.540
much else other than work.

44:31.540 --> 44:35.420
I mean, I worked out when I had kids, I tried to spend some time with my kids.

44:35.420 --> 44:40.060
I still found time for fun and vacations, but, you know, I would vacation two weeks

44:40.060 --> 44:41.060
a year.

44:41.060 --> 44:44.780
Now I vacation a lot more than that.

44:44.780 --> 44:47.100
And, but I don't see any way around it.

44:47.100 --> 44:50.700
It's really, my kids, when I say my kids, my students, I'll ask them how much money they

44:50.700 --> 44:55.380
expect to be making by the time they're 35 and about 90% of them expect to be in the

44:55.380 --> 45:00.340
top 1%, which is $750,000 a year in America.

45:00.340 --> 45:02.140
And then they'll talk about that.

45:02.140 --> 45:03.140
Like that's what I expect.

45:03.140 --> 45:06.580
But I'll say, what's most important to you in your life and moving forward?

45:06.580 --> 45:08.540
And a lot of the time they say balance.

45:08.540 --> 45:14.420
And I'm like, so you expect to be in the top 1% by the time you're 35, but you also believe

45:14.420 --> 45:16.420
you're going to have balance in your life?

45:16.420 --> 45:19.220
I mean, I don't, I've never seen that.

45:19.220 --> 45:20.220
I don't.

45:20.220 --> 45:21.220
You can have it all.

45:21.220 --> 45:23.700
You just can't have it all at once.

45:23.700 --> 45:26.340
And by the way, that's, that may not be the way to go.

45:26.340 --> 45:29.580
You may sacrifice, you may say, I want to live a nice kind of balanced life.

45:29.580 --> 45:33.180
I'm going to move to a suburb of St. Louis, coach Little League, work 40 hours a week,

45:33.180 --> 45:38.900
be a good citizen, find a good partner, you know, coach Little League, have a nice life.

45:38.900 --> 45:39.900
Nothing wrong with that.

45:39.900 --> 45:42.860
But the majority of the people I know, the young people, think they're going to be in

45:42.860 --> 45:45.220
the top 1% and also have balance in their life.

45:45.220 --> 45:46.220
And I just, it's ridiculous.

45:46.220 --> 45:50.460
I'm like, okay, the only way to get there to achieve that is if you have one thing and

45:50.460 --> 45:57.180
that's rich parents, otherwise expect to go all in on your career or scale back your expectations

45:57.180 --> 46:01.420
around your economics and your influence because it's a competitive market.

46:01.420 --> 46:05.140
And one of the things people can control is how hard they work.

46:05.140 --> 46:09.780
I don't think you want to, I don't think you want to work so much that you sacrifice your

46:09.780 --> 46:12.180
health or your relationships.

46:12.180 --> 46:14.060
There is going to be some trade off with your relationships.

46:14.060 --> 46:16.140
I didn't see my kids a lot when they were little.

46:16.140 --> 46:17.140
I was divorced.

46:17.140 --> 46:18.780
I think it was a contributor to that.

46:18.780 --> 46:22.380
I was always working in services companies and never saying no to any opportunity.

46:22.380 --> 46:26.380
The CMO of Samsung, can you be in Seoul tomorrow for a board meeting?

46:26.380 --> 46:27.380
Sure I can.

46:27.380 --> 46:32.820
You know, I mean, I just said yes to everything to try and move the company forward.

46:32.820 --> 46:41.700
But I, for a long period, worked very, very hard and sacrificed a lot and it takes a toll.

46:41.700 --> 46:45.460
And I did it such that I could have a lot more balance now.

46:45.460 --> 46:50.420
But yeah, I don't, this notion, the myth of balance, get over it.

46:50.420 --> 46:54.460
If you expect to be influential or economically secure, you're not going to have a lot of

46:54.460 --> 46:56.420
balance for a long period of time.

46:56.420 --> 47:00.860
Some people are such geniuses that they can work a modest amount of time, make a lot of

47:00.860 --> 47:06.420
money, work out, have a great relationship with their parents, be fit, donate time at

47:06.420 --> 47:11.100
the ASPCA and have a food blog, assume you are not that person.

47:11.100 --> 47:15.740
So just have a sober conversation and also have a sober conversation with your partner.

47:15.740 --> 47:17.500
How much money do we expect to have?

47:17.500 --> 47:18.940
Who's responsible for making it?

47:18.940 --> 47:20.900
What's your approach to spending?

47:20.900 --> 47:22.780
Where are we going to live?

47:22.780 --> 47:28.980
The number one source of divorce is not infidelity or lack of shared values.

47:28.980 --> 47:32.180
It's usually got something to do with money and also 70% of divorce filings are filed

47:32.180 --> 47:35.740
by women who still, and we don't like to say this because we like to pretend women have

47:35.740 --> 47:41.340
no agency and that they're just doughy little foes.

47:41.340 --> 47:46.780
The man loses a business, becomes broke or has a mental breakdown.

47:46.780 --> 47:54.420
When a man loses a status as a provider, he's very inclined to be on the wrong end of divorce.

47:54.420 --> 47:55.660
So I think a lot about young men.

47:55.660 --> 47:57.140
I think a lot about financial security.

47:57.140 --> 48:00.980
I think every man should start with the notion that he's going to be responsible for the

48:00.980 --> 48:03.380
economic well-being of his household.

48:03.380 --> 48:07.500
And by the way, sometimes that means getting out of the way and being more supportive of

48:07.500 --> 48:12.100
your partner who happens to be better at that money thing than you.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.540
And that's a wonderful thing.

48:13.540 --> 48:20.500
But start from a position of this is my responsibility and make sure you're aligned with your partner

48:20.500 --> 48:24.580
around this stuff because the thing we don't talk about is that your kids are going to

48:24.580 --> 48:27.380
have higher blood pressure if you're economically strained.

48:27.380 --> 48:33.100
Kids in low-income households have greater systolic resting blood pressure than kids

48:33.100 --> 48:35.060
in middle and upper-income homes.

48:35.060 --> 48:36.740
You're much more likely to get divorced.

48:36.740 --> 48:38.780
You're much more likely to have a stroke.

48:38.780 --> 48:42.380
You're much more likely to be the victim or the perpetrator of domestic violence when

48:42.380 --> 48:44.020
you don't have money.

48:44.020 --> 48:47.340
You know, America becomes more like itself every day.

48:47.340 --> 48:50.540
And that is it's a loving, generous place for people with money.

48:50.540 --> 48:54.300
It's a rapacious, violent place for people who don't have money.

48:54.300 --> 48:59.340
So all this bullshit that money doesn't buy you happiness, oh my God, is that a myth?

48:59.340 --> 49:04.140
I'm not saying you need to be incredibly wealthy, but middle-income people are happier than

49:04.140 --> 49:07.660
poor people and wealthy people are happier than middle-income people.

49:07.660 --> 49:08.660
That's the bad news.

49:08.660 --> 49:10.860
The good news is that it tops out.

49:10.860 --> 49:12.860
You get diminishing returns.

49:12.860 --> 49:18.580
And you have to be cognizant of when you do get to some level of economic security, that's

49:18.580 --> 49:19.980
the means.

49:19.980 --> 49:26.940
The ends is such that you can have an exhale, release the anxiety that you feel, and then

49:26.980 --> 49:32.380
use the opportunity to really spend a lot of time with your loved ones and cement those

49:32.380 --> 49:33.940
relationships.

49:33.940 --> 49:37.540
And the problem is you get on the sadonic treadmill and you get so absorbed in your

49:37.540 --> 49:41.780
own success and your professional identity and money and making more money that you never

49:41.780 --> 49:43.260
get to the ends.

49:43.260 --> 49:46.660
You wake up a wealthy person or someone who's financially secure as I always thought about

49:46.660 --> 49:51.500
their economic well-being, and you don't really have a great relationship with your kids or

49:51.500 --> 49:55.620
you never really leaned into your partnership and thought, okay, let's take time to really

49:55.660 --> 49:57.060
enjoy each other's company.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.100
Let's do nice things.

49:59.100 --> 50:02.820
Your parents die before you have a chance to really spend time with them as adults.

50:02.820 --> 50:05.980
I think that happens to a lot of people.

50:05.980 --> 50:09.820
They just get so caught up and I need the next promotion.

50:09.820 --> 50:11.420
I need the next amount of money.

50:11.420 --> 50:14.900
And once I get here, I have someone very close to my life.

50:14.900 --> 50:18.620
It's a family member and I'm taking them to Africa and they're like making excuses, but

50:18.620 --> 50:21.140
our kids in the choir, they weren't making excuses.

50:21.140 --> 50:25.500
I'm like, you realize this is your last chance to go to Africa before you're dead, right?

50:25.980 --> 50:27.220
You're 50 fucking years old.

50:27.220 --> 50:29.140
When do you go when you're 70?

50:29.140 --> 50:31.180
But you got to get back to work an extra day.

50:31.180 --> 50:32.900
I mean, what are you thinking?

50:32.900 --> 50:34.580
We're going to be dead soon.

50:34.580 --> 50:41.980
And I just think so many people don't realize how fast it's going to go by and never really,

50:41.980 --> 50:47.420
never really like super, not only super lean into the relationships, but just allow themselves

50:47.420 --> 50:48.940
just to have a great time.

50:48.940 --> 50:50.380
I'm going to stagecoach this week.

50:50.380 --> 50:52.140
I'm going to go to country music festival.

50:52.140 --> 50:56.100
I can't stand country, but I'm going.

50:56.100 --> 50:57.940
I'm going to buy a pair of boots.

50:57.940 --> 51:01.620
I'm going to have a great time and I'm going to do an edible and I'm going to drink a Chiton

51:01.620 --> 51:05.940
and I'm going to have arrested adolescents with my friends and I'm going to look ridiculous.

51:05.940 --> 51:09.140
And it's like, yeah, why not?

51:09.140 --> 51:10.460
Why the fuck not?

51:10.460 --> 51:11.020
What am I going to do?

51:11.020 --> 51:13.380
Watch C-SPAN all weekend?

51:13.380 --> 51:19.100
I mean, anyway, I can't stand it when people who are blessed with being in this country

51:19.180 --> 51:22.540
have some level of economic security, have people in their life that love them and they

51:22.540 --> 51:28.780
love and they don't like crazy lean into it because you guys are younger than I can.

51:28.780 --> 51:30.660
It just goes so goddamn fast.

51:30.660 --> 51:31.660
It's just crazy.

51:31.660 --> 51:33.820
It is just crazy how fast it goes.

51:33.820 --> 51:34.820
Anyways.

51:34.820 --> 51:38.700
Well, I don't know how to respond to that, Scott.

51:38.700 --> 51:39.940
Here's what I do know.

51:39.940 --> 51:44.860
I feel like I learned something and I feel a little bit bad inside at the same time.

51:44.860 --> 51:49.860
I feel a little bit good and you made me feel a little bit bad and I need to go and I need

51:49.860 --> 51:51.580
to like burp or something.

51:51.580 --> 51:53.500
I need to get a little bit out of my system.

51:53.500 --> 51:56.140
I just need to unwind from that.

51:56.140 --> 51:58.020
Do they not have Zoloft in London?

51:58.020 --> 52:00.540
You know, I haven't hit the anti-depressant.

52:00.540 --> 52:01.980
I just had ketamine therapy though.

52:01.980 --> 52:02.980
That was a trip.

52:02.980 --> 52:08.020
No, I'm trying to, I'm trying to just, you know, like the good news is I hate my life

52:08.020 --> 52:13.300
less and less every day, so I'm sort of getting there.

52:13.300 --> 52:14.860
I'm sort of getting there.

52:14.860 --> 52:19.260
You're like if Mitch Hedberg had a podcast and opened an LLC.

52:19.260 --> 52:21.980
Are we going to talk about, are we going to talk about my book?

52:21.980 --> 52:26.540
Do you think I got to number one talking about like doing therapy with you guys on these

52:26.540 --> 52:28.140
Joey Baganonas podcast?

52:28.140 --> 52:29.420
Are you going to bring up my book?

52:29.420 --> 52:30.420
Yeah.

52:30.420 --> 52:31.420
Tell us about the book.

52:31.420 --> 52:32.420
Okay.

52:32.420 --> 52:36.420
We talked a little bit about the book, but tell us the floor is yours.

52:36.420 --> 52:39.420
Make your case as to what I'm going to get out of this book because I'm going to buy

52:39.420 --> 52:40.420
it and I'm going to read it.

52:40.420 --> 52:41.420
Okay.

52:41.420 --> 52:42.420
Thanks for that.

52:42.420 --> 52:44.740
It's a different level of enthusiasm if you give me a little teaser of what I'm going

52:44.740 --> 52:45.740
to get out of it.

52:45.740 --> 52:46.740
Okay.

52:46.740 --> 52:49.300
So the algebra of wealth is the following.

52:49.300 --> 52:55.340
Find your talent, focus, workshop your 20s in an industry that will pay you.

52:55.340 --> 52:59.420
Once you have a certain amount of momentum professionally, really try and develop a savings

52:59.420 --> 53:00.420
muscle.

53:00.420 --> 53:03.260
Wealth isn't about how much you make, it's about how much you spend.

53:03.260 --> 53:06.220
Try and just get to the point at a fairly early stage where you spend less than you

53:06.220 --> 53:07.220
make.

53:07.220 --> 53:08.220
That is very difficult.

53:08.220 --> 53:11.740
The brightest companies and minds in the world are all here to convince you that an

53:11.740 --> 53:16.060
upgrade from economy to economy comfort, to economy plus, to business classes and investment

53:16.060 --> 53:17.060
in yourself.

53:17.060 --> 53:18.380
No, it's not.

53:18.380 --> 53:19.380
It's consumption.

53:19.380 --> 53:21.900
Don't try and impress other people with your shit.

53:21.900 --> 53:23.820
No one's as concerned with your shit as you are.

53:23.820 --> 53:27.460
You don't need to order a bottle of vodka at a club for 450 bucks.

53:27.460 --> 53:29.940
Get a Hyundai for God's sakes.

53:29.940 --> 53:31.060
Travel coach.

53:31.060 --> 53:32.060
Save money.

53:32.060 --> 53:33.060
Start saving money early.

53:33.060 --> 53:34.060
Lean in.

53:34.060 --> 53:36.420
If you're young, lean into your advantage and that is you have a lot of time.

53:36.420 --> 53:38.220
Develop that savings muscle.

53:38.220 --> 53:41.820
Diversify the moment you have any real capital.

53:41.820 --> 53:44.900
Start diversifying that way no matter what happens.

53:44.900 --> 53:45.900
You have Kevlar.

53:45.900 --> 53:48.700
You can have a stock go to zero and a bullet hits you in the chest.

53:48.700 --> 53:51.580
It doesn't kill you because you're diversified.

53:51.580 --> 53:56.660
Then take advantage of the flaw in the species and that's time and recognize that time will

53:56.660 --> 53:58.100
go faster than you think.

53:58.100 --> 54:01.540
If you're just a little bit of discipline, a little bit of maturity, a little bit of

54:01.540 --> 54:06.380
that savings muscle early, that the S&P is up 11% a year since 2008.

54:06.380 --> 54:07.580
Well, that sounds boring.

54:07.780 --> 54:13.740
Now that means every 21 years your investments are up 8x and that 21 years will go really

54:13.740 --> 54:14.740
fast.

54:14.740 --> 54:16.340
So hope you sell a best selling book.

54:16.340 --> 54:17.700
Hope your company goes public.

54:17.700 --> 54:22.700
Hope your album goes double platinum or some rich uncle dies and leaves you everything.

54:22.700 --> 54:27.180
But just in case, make sure you're financially secure and I can get you there.

54:27.180 --> 54:32.140
If you follow these principles and show a little bit of discipline, a little bit of maturity

54:32.140 --> 54:34.820
because the good news is I can get you rich.

54:34.820 --> 54:37.460
The bad news is the answer is slowly.

54:37.460 --> 54:39.260
We can get you there.

54:39.260 --> 54:45.900
So the algebra of wealth equals focus plus stoicism times time times diversification.

54:45.900 --> 54:47.340
That's the formula.

54:47.340 --> 54:48.340
That's the formula.

54:48.340 --> 54:49.340
You're the formula guy.

54:49.340 --> 54:53.220
A lot of your talks, you use formulas to explain stuff.

54:53.220 --> 54:55.500
You've had the algebra of happiness, now the algebra of wealth.

54:55.500 --> 55:00.020
Is this going to be a whole algebra of blank series?

55:00.020 --> 55:01.780
Any time I see that, I'm into it.

55:01.780 --> 55:04.020
If it's an equation, I'm into it.

55:04.020 --> 55:08.060
So humans need constructs to remember things.

55:08.060 --> 55:11.540
You can read a book and if it doesn't have constructs or visualizations, it's pretty

55:11.540 --> 55:13.020
easy to forget about it.

55:13.020 --> 55:15.340
So I really like constructs, equations.

55:15.340 --> 55:20.340
I read the algebra of happiness, algebra of wealth out today and I'm about to sign a three

55:20.340 --> 55:21.340
book deal.

55:21.340 --> 55:25.940
I'm writing the algebra of masculinity, the algebra of work, and the algebra of mating.

55:25.940 --> 55:29.300
Those are three topics I'm super interested in and I want to try and do enough research

55:29.300 --> 55:32.740
where I can distill it down to some best practices that people can hold on to.

55:33.460 --> 55:35.380
Well, I want to talk about the first variable in this.

55:35.380 --> 55:38.500
You said focus, because we talked about socialism.

55:38.500 --> 55:39.500
I know about time.

55:39.500 --> 55:41.780
I know about diversification, but teach me about focus.

55:41.780 --> 55:45.900
I'm pretty bad at focus, trying to get better.

55:45.900 --> 55:49.700
Give me a couple words on focus as part of this equation.

55:49.700 --> 55:54.300
If you have a side hustle, you need to find a different main hustle.

55:54.300 --> 55:59.340
You're better off with the time you spent on a side hustle, investing that incremental

55:59.340 --> 56:00.820
effort in your main hustle.

56:00.820 --> 56:04.340
If you constantly find it, a side hustle is fine if you're investigating a new main

56:04.340 --> 56:07.860
hustle, but the way you get wealthy is not a variety of things.

56:07.860 --> 56:09.740
It's being really great at one thing.

56:09.740 --> 56:15.580
So that's the focus and the term we use is mastery or ninja like capability, but try

56:15.580 --> 56:22.140
and find something you could become great at and that's not easy.

56:22.140 --> 56:26.340
But also, again, we talked about this before, finding an industry that's not very sexy because

56:26.380 --> 56:35.700
if you're in the top 10% of tax law or of installing HVAC or energy efficient HVAC,

56:35.700 --> 56:41.220
or you're in the top 10% of people who know how to install soapstone kitchen counters,

56:41.220 --> 56:43.860
you're going to make a really good living.

56:43.860 --> 56:47.700
Taking care of your kids is just so much fun.

56:47.700 --> 56:53.100
Being able to be there for your parents is economically, is just really exciting and

56:53.140 --> 56:54.580
really a lot of fun.

56:54.580 --> 56:58.740
And I think young people mistake passion for their hobbies, not recognizing when they get

56:58.740 --> 57:04.980
older to be able to give money away, to be able to do nice things, to be able to relax

57:04.980 --> 57:07.380
with your partner.

57:07.380 --> 57:08.860
It's just super enjoyable.

57:08.860 --> 57:14.260
It's almost as fun as spinning to, I mean, that shit is fun.

57:14.260 --> 57:15.940
That is really enjoyable.

57:15.940 --> 57:19.980
And so put yourself in a position when you're a little bit older because it'll go really

57:19.980 --> 57:24.260
fast to just do wonderful things with people you care about.

57:24.260 --> 57:28.940
And the way you get there is by making more than you spend saving, but the first thing

57:28.940 --> 57:31.740
you got to do is find the focus.

57:31.740 --> 57:33.700
Find something.

57:33.700 --> 57:37.020
We live in a specialist economy.

57:37.020 --> 57:41.780
Find something like, try and just think, could I be great at this?

57:41.780 --> 57:42.900
Could I be great at this?

57:42.900 --> 57:46.460
That's not the question because if you become great at it, trust me, you'll become passionate

57:46.460 --> 57:47.460
about it.

57:47.460 --> 57:49.500
And you can't become great at anything you hate.

57:49.500 --> 57:51.860
It's just going to be automatically be screened out.

57:51.860 --> 57:54.540
I'm not suggesting drudgery is the way.

57:54.540 --> 57:57.540
If you find something drudgerous or whatever the term is, you're just not going to be great

57:57.540 --> 57:58.780
at it.

57:58.780 --> 58:00.660
But I found consulting.

58:00.660 --> 58:04.980
I never, I didn't know what consulting was when I was in college, even business school.

58:04.980 --> 58:08.780
I figured out, wait, people will pay you to wrench your brain?

58:08.780 --> 58:09.780
Wow.

58:09.780 --> 58:13.260
And I was always really good at establishing these proxy father-son relationships with

58:13.260 --> 58:15.100
powerful men.

58:15.100 --> 58:20.100
And then basically my core deal with them is, I understand brand better than you.

58:20.100 --> 58:21.100
You're the CMO.

58:21.100 --> 58:22.380
I'm going to make you the CEO in three years.

58:22.380 --> 58:25.940
In exchange for that, you're going to pay my company a million dollars a year to answer

58:25.940 --> 58:29.300
very deep, hard questions.

58:29.300 --> 58:32.820
And I figured that out at kind of my late 20s, which was a blessing.

58:32.820 --> 58:35.540
And then when I sold the company, I'm like, I don't want to be in services anymore.

58:35.540 --> 58:36.660
It's a young person's business.

58:36.660 --> 58:38.460
I'm sick of being on planes.

58:38.460 --> 58:40.580
So I had to workshop my life again.

58:40.580 --> 58:42.260
And then I figured out, okay, I'm a good teacher.

58:42.260 --> 58:43.260
What does it mean to be a good teacher?

58:43.260 --> 58:44.780
It means you have to be a good storyteller.

58:44.780 --> 58:46.980
But what if I story told in different mediums?

58:46.980 --> 58:47.980
Could I make money in books?

58:47.980 --> 58:49.380
Could I make money speaking?

58:49.380 --> 58:51.940
Could I make money in podcasts?

58:51.940 --> 58:53.700
And I figured out, yeah, I'm good at this.

58:53.700 --> 58:55.980
I could even be great someday.

58:55.980 --> 58:59.420
And that mastery has led to a really nice life.

58:59.420 --> 59:05.980
But I've always tried to spend reasonably, spend less than I was making, sometimes more

59:05.980 --> 59:08.060
than others.

59:08.060 --> 59:10.180
I finally learned to diversify the hard way.

59:10.180 --> 59:14.820
I lost everything twice in 2000 and again in 2008, because I thought it was so awesome

59:14.820 --> 59:18.460
that whatever is my focus, this is naturally going to be successful through my sheer force

59:18.460 --> 59:20.060
of character.

59:20.060 --> 59:21.420
That's not true.

59:21.420 --> 59:27.700
So I started diversifying and just kind of follow these basic principles and let time

59:27.700 --> 59:31.220
take over and really started saving a lot of money in my 40s.

59:31.220 --> 59:37.820
I deployed an army of capital to start fighting and killing for me and my family and my sleep.

59:37.820 --> 59:46.660
And that army just grew in a bull market and came home with just immense spoils for me

59:46.660 --> 59:50.380
because I deployed this army early and often and I kept adding to it.

59:50.380 --> 59:52.380
I feel like, here's a tank.

59:52.380 --> 59:53.380
All right.

59:53.380 --> 59:54.380
Okay.

59:54.380 --> 59:55.380
I'm saving money.

59:55.380 --> 59:56.380
I'm not going to have the fat apartment.

59:56.380 --> 59:57.380
All right.

59:57.380 --> 59:58.380
Okay.

59:58.380 --> 59:59.380
Here's some more artillery.

59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380
Go kill more people and come home with money.

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.900
That's a little bit much.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900
Anyways.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:04.780
We're still working off of that one.

01:00:04.780 --> 01:00:05.780
Yeah.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:06.780
Still working through that one.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.820
Wrong choice.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820
Wrong choice of words.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.820
Accoutrements.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.300
The accoutrements of my army.

01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:13.660
Scott, thanks for coming on, man.

01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.180
And everybody go buy the book, the algebra of wealth.

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:20.500
He has to be number one on the charts because he needs our affirmation and let's give it

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.500
to him.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500
Thanks, guys.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:23.500
Thanks for your success.

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:24.500
Thanks, Sam.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500
Thanks, Sean.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.500
And thanks, Ari.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.500
Thank you.

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:28.500
Bye.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.500
Bye.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:30.500
Bye.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.500
Bye.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.500
Bye.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.500
Bye.

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.500
Bye.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:35.500
Bye.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.500
Bye.
