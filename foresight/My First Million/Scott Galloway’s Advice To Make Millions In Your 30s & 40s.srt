1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
My first Nellian.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's go.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
My first baby mama, my first ketamine experience, my first addiction.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Here's what I want to start with.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I love some of the things that you say.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And one of the things you said is,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
don't follow your passion.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
People who are already rich tell you to follow your passion.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You should follow your talent.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Can you unpack that? Can you explain what you mean?

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I wanted to be an athlete.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That was my passion.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And then I'm going to UCLA as a blessing,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
because I figured out pretty quickly that I wasn't in the 0.1% you need to be

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and to make your living as an athlete.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And there's a fair, there's some pretty basic axioms

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
that should guide your career choices around where you invest your most,

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
precious capital, and that is your time, your human capital.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The first is the sexier the business, the lower return on investment.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You want to be in fashion, the arts, movies, modeling, sports.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Unless you get really incandescent green lights from a very early age,

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
so you're going to be in the 0.1%,

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
try and make a living somewhere else and then do that on the weekends.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And that is if you, the SAG-AFTRA, the most talented actors in the world,

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it's hard to get a SAG-AFTRA union card.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You have to actually ban something.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
These are the most talented actors in the world, 182,000 of them.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
87% of them don't qualify for health insurance

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
because they don't make more than $23,000 in a given year.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So the key is finding, not finding your passion, but finding your talent

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and then committing to developing mastery.

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And if you can develop mastery in anything that has a 90% plus employment rate,

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
which 98% of sectors enjoy, the economic accoutrements, the camaraderie,

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
the prestige, the relevance, just the sheer joy of mastery

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
will make you passionate about whatever it is.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And I'm passionate about taking care of my kids.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm passionate about being able to step in and help my aging father.

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm passionate about, I'd rather be Raphael Nadal or Federer,

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but I'd rather be me than the number three or number four tennis player in the world

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
because I have financial security, I get to go to Wimbledon on my own terms

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and not be as nervous and not throw up or before a match.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So yeah, I'd rather be Nadal, but pretty much anyone else playing tennis, I'd rather be.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
And I got there with boring companies.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So the less sexy a business, the higher the return on investment.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So I would suggest that we stop, you know, think about, well, what could I be good at?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I think that's what your 20s are for, workshopping stuff and also getting it wrong.

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I started in investment banking and I was terrible at it.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I didn't like them, they didn't like me.

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And I had to go back to business school and just start workshopping.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Where could I be great?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What industry could I be great in?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So don't, you know, find what you're good at and then get great at it

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and then be a DJ on the weekends.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
By the way, congratulations today.

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Today's the release date of the book, right?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Algebra of wealth.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Today is the day.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So that's, that's going to be huge.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I mean, I read the algebra of happiness a while ago and I've been watching the videos forever.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And so I kind of, I didn't get an early copy of the book, but I will buy it and read it.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
And so you'll get my $23.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I need you to, by the way, we're number one on Amazon today.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just thought I would drop that because I'm desperate.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm desperate for your affirmation, Sam.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's all right. I'll give it to you.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'll give it to you.

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I won't starve you from that.

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You've got it.

69
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I look up to you.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I think you're the man.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, let me ask you about the number one on Amazon real quick.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You, you're a pretty stoic guy.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In fact, when you come on the pod, it's always surprising to me that you are so even keel,

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
but it's the launch day of your book.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You worked on this thing really hard.

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Your number one on Amazon, what, how does Scott Galloway celebrate?

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, you know, I'm not, I'm pretty flat.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I don't, I congratulate the team.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It feels great.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's very gratifying.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I love benchmarks.

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm addicted to me.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Everyone's addicted to something.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm addicted to strangers affirmation, which is kind of pathetic at my age.

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And that's a form of affirmation, but it's very rewarding because so many people work

87
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
so goddamn hard on this thing, just not me, but, you know, my research is my analyst,

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
my PR people, my social people, my publisher, my book agent, you know, greatness is in the

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
agency of others.

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So it's just very gratifying.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
And plus my podcast co-hosts got to number three on the best sellers list.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So goddamn it, if I'm not going to get to number two, I must beat Kara Swisher.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So, Sam, if you could go buy several thousand books, I'd appreciate it.

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And if you like it, write a review.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And if you hate it, please buy more and send them to an enemy.

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But yeah, I'm addicted to external affirmation.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's really pathetic.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Well, so, I mean, the book, from my understanding, is that it's basically talks about the people

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
who have money and the people who don't, and what are the commonalities between the winners

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and the losers.

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And you have, I've read this for years.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
There was this awesome fast company article about you, and I've seen you say this in videos

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
where you were shockingly calculating when starting your last company, L2.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think you said something like Deloitte did a study.

105
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They did a study that shows what's the difference between the people who sell their companies

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
for five to ten times revenue versus those who just sell it for one or two times.

107
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
And you had these like four or five things, and it was, they own a niche, they have recurring revenue,

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
tech is at their core, and that they're international, and then finally they have defensive IP.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
And then you went on and said how like in your 40s, when you were starting L2, 40s and 50s,

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you were like only focused on money.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You said, I worked my ass off, I was there at the office at 2 a.m.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You said, but I don't regret it.

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You said it was totally worth it.

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And when you were starting L2, I don't really know too much about that industry or that business

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
other than a handful of articles.

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Were you that calculating with working backwards from an exit?

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And by the way, the story ends with you selling it for $120 million.

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
160, boss. Jesus, get your facts right.

119
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And by the way, I'm number one on Amazon today.

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't know if I told you that.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, I didn't have a lot of money, and for me, work was about getting economic security.

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I was very focused on money.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And I'm not saying that's the right way, it was just my way.

124
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
And I had done a lot of analysis in this study referring to said, okay,

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
there are companies that sell in any industry, the lowest 10 percentile,

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the upper-desile of the valuations they get taken out at.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And this study looked at the common features of the companies that got sold in the top-desile.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And it was all the things you talked about.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And that's literally how I shaped the business model.

130
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I went to the London office right away.

131
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I said, charging consulting fees, I said, pay me a quarter of a million bucks a year,

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and I'll answer your toughest questions using data.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We focused on luxury and then consumer brands.

134
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
We broadened our niche a little bit.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We spent, I raised $17 million to create a series of technology and scraping tools

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
so that I could collect more data points than anyone in the world,

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,000
such that when the inevitable guy from the analytics department came in with his arms crossed to play, gotcha,

138
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
they just couldn't argue with our data.

139
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
We just collected more data than anyone in the world on these issues

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and tried to distill it down to something actionable.

141
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So I was very focused on exit.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And we sold for eight times revenue.

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,000
So yeah, man, my basic pitch to people was, you're going to work your ass off

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and I'm going to try and get you to, you know,

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm going to try and get you to where your parents were 20 years earlier.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
And if you're looking for balance, this isn't that place.

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you're really into management or other things, tell me,

148
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and I will try and shape a role around what's important to you.

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
But we are a small business going all in to try and create economic security for us and our families.

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
With Prop Team Media, we're about 14 people now.

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I purposely didn't take outside capital.

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm not on that hamster wheel again.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm not trying to, Jones for an exit,

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm trying to build something interesting that has relevance,

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
that has a little bit more impact on the social issues we think about

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and also pair people really well.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I used to pay people below market and give them equity

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and I was throwing nickels around like there are manhole covers

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
because I wanted to have a profitable company I could sell.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Now my priorities have changed.

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And the people who joined the company, I tell them,

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
this isn't the kind of company that gets sold.

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But what I'll do is I'll share, I'll give you equity or participation in my book deals.

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are a junior analyst, you get one or two percent of any book deal I get.

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Try and create some economic upside for them.

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
My natural starting point is that people come to work

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to develop economic security for them and their families,

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
to increase their currency, their currency and the marketplace experience

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and also to develop relationships.

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The workplace is a great place to meet friends, mentors, additional co-founders.

171
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And we spend a lot of money on, we saved, with COVID we gave up our office,

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we save about $800,000 or $900,000 a year on an office

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
because of course as a narcissist I had to have this amazing office in Soho, which was stupid.

174
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And I have this rule at work, or not this rule, but this benefit.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If any four of them are together, they get my credit card.

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
They can go to Broadway or they can go to Tulum.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And they've done those things without asking my permission.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
As long as there's four of them, they got my credit card.

179
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And the number one source of retention,

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I think the key to building a small business is retention because if you find good people,

181
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
you just don't want them to be with you a year or two years and go to Google

182
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
because the switching costs are enormous.

183
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And if you find someone good, your job as an entrepreneur or the CEO

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
is just to create an environment where they want to stick.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Retention of employees, in my opinion, is just huge.

186
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And I find, or I read a study, another study on this,

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
and it said the number one source of retention or the number one lever for retention,

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
people think it's compensation, people think it's culture.

189
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's whether or not that person has a friend at work.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If they have a friend at work, they look forward to going to work

191
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
and they are less likely to leave.

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
And so what I try and do, everybody interviews everybody when we hire people,

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
but these kids, it's really inspiring.

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They'll go, like six of them will go on vacation together.

195
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
They'll say, oh, Scott, you're speaking in Hamburg, Germany.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
All six of us are going to come.

197
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
And they have a great time together.

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They're like each other.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
And it's really, it's a powerful kind of business weapon, if you will.

200
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Now, I don't think you can do that when it's a company scales beyond 50, 100 people.

201
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I found for a small business, it's really powerful.

202
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hey, real quick, as you know, we're big on ideas here.

203
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We love bringing new ideas, business ideas, brainstorming ideas for the podcast.

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, a lot of people ask, what do you do with all those ideas?

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Can we go find them?

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Is there a list somewhere?

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000

Check it out.

215
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's in the description below.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All right.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Back to the show.

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And is the trick there that you don't try to be their friend?

219
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Because I've had that problem before.

220
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I wanted to be the friend and that made the management a little bit messy.

221
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And I realized it is much better for me to not be the friend and not be included in the

222
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
hangs.

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
The whole company functions better.

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Even personally, I was like, oh man, they're all going out without me.

225
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But actually it was far better that it went that way.

226
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I always had a healthy sense of what the border was.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Me and my president and my committee and the partner at L2, we're both about the same age

228
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
and we have the same view.

229
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We have parties all the time.

230
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We show up early.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
As soon as shit starts getting a little like crazy, we leave.

232
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yeah.

233
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
A, we don't need to see them drunk.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They definitely don't need to see me drunk.

235
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,000
And my attitude is what you're saying, Sean, is really interesting.

236
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And that is I'm just coming to the realization as a dad.

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm not their friend.

238
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm their dad.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Because it was really upsetting to me that my kids did kind of, I don't want to say I

240
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
don't want to be my friend, but I just naturally assumed that my kids would adore me and be

241
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
really into World War II history and CrossFit because that's what dad is into.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
And guess what?

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
They're not.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And what I realized is I'm not their friend.

245
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm there to be their dad.

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
And it's kind of the same way I think I work with such young people.

247
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I think the average age is probably 30 or 34 because I'm there.

248
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
But the median is like 25.

249
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It's basically a bunch of kids, overeducated, super ambitious kids.

250
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And it's easy.

251
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
They're doing dinner and drink somewhere.

252
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I show up for dinner.

253
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I leave before dessert.

254
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
And then they can, you know, they can enjoy each other without thinking they're being judged

255
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
by Scott.

256
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't, I draw sharp relief between, you know, work and

257
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
fun with those guys.

258
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I love it.

259
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I go out with them, but I go out for the first couple hours and then I disappear so they

260
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
can, they can have their own son.

261
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I love the four of you together.

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You get my card.

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's amazing little tidbit.

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm, I'm here to collect little lessons learned from you today.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And that's, that's one immediate one for me.

266
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Thanks mom.

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
So like, obviously you're kind of, you're, I don't, I don't know if you're at the peak,

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
but you're, you're at, you're killing it right now in terms of your pod and kind of

269
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
being a public figure in the books and everything.

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
And then before that you had the company.

271
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So you had a huge financial outcome.

272
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
One of the things that I think it's kind of brushed over in your history is what you

273
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
were doing with kind of being an activist investor.

274
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I know you were on the board of New York times and you made a few other like pretty like

275
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
substantial investments.

276
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I know you were working with a hedge fund to do that.

277
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What were some of the deals that you were doing?

278
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What were some of the kind of the best deals?

279
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What were some of the worst deals?

280
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What were some of the signals that you had where you were like, this is an interesting

281
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
deal.

282
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I should pounce on this.

283
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Sure.

284
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So there's a bit of a backstory there.

285
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I started coming to go rent envelope and went public.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I was on the board.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I got into a fight with arguably the most successful venture capitalist in the world.

288
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Spoiler alert.

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He won the fight.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I was kicked off the board.

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So I was kicked out of the band that I started, which was like emotionally and mentally very

292
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
taxing for me.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And then I got angry.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was a really weird time in my life.

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
My mom was dying and I moved in with her.

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And during the day I would take manager health care at night.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
She was living in Vegas.

298
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'd go to downtown and get shitty drunk with strippers and quote unquote friends and then

299
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
go back and manage my mom's health care and watch everyone loves Raymond and Jeopardy with

300
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
my mom.

301
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It was a strange time in my life.

302
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,660
I was also very angry because I'd just been kicked off the board of rent envelope.

303
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,320
So I took a half a million dollars in my money and I filed a proxy to replace the entire

304
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,080
board.

305
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,680
And I learned everything about activist investing and shareholder governance.

306
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,000
And I tried to kick everyone off the board.

307
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,880
And I own 10% of the company and I think I got 12% of the vote and my proxy solicitor

308
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,680
said that 2% was probably a mistake.

309
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,680
So basically no one voted for my slate and that was kind of a low moment for me.

310
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,680
Okay.

311
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,480
The world has told me they don't want me involved in this corporation or in public companies.

312
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,800
And then six months later, I got a call from a hedge fund that said, you're crazy, but you

313
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,840
are kind of crazy.

314
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,560
We have some stakes in companies and we need someone to kind of go in and rattle the cage.

315
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,040
And it just struck me that at your lowest moment, you really don't know where that might lead.

316
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,360
And I got backed.

317
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,360
I went into a company called, I bought 10% of a company called United Retail, which was

318
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,560
a plus size clothing brand.

319
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,960
I basically showed up and said, let me build your website.

320
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
You don't have a website.

321
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,720
This was a while ago where I'm going to try and replace the board.

322
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,200
This had fine.

323
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,560
Stock went from two to eight and I'm like, wow, this is easy.

324
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,520
And I did it at Sharper Image, bought a big stake there, went in there.

325
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,240
The company seemed like a mess.

326
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Stock had gone up a little bit.

327
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
I got out.

328
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I did it at Gateway Computer.

329
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,240
Went on the board there.

330
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
That was more difficult.

331
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,520
We made a small amount of money, but I'd never lost money doing it.

332
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,720
So then I went and raised $700 million and became the largest shareholder in the New

333
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,640
York Times and went on the board there.

334
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
And timing is everything.

335
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:26,040
And in this case, I went on the board in March of 2008.

336
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,520
And the stock went from 16 to three in about five months.

337
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:34,640
At one point, I think I was losing $10 or $12 million of other people's money every day.

338
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,160
And we almost lost the business.

339
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
The company almost went bankrupt.

340
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,480
I don't know if you guys remember that, but in the world of media, people just stopped

341
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
advertising.

342
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,480
They just stopped.

343
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,840
It was like our tap of revenue just got turned off.

344
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,080
And it was sort of the great financial recession.

345
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,400
It kind of ended my career as an activism because one, I don't think I was very good

346
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
at it.

347
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:01,000
And two, I was getting to a stage in my life where I just didn't want to be combative anymore.

348
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,040
I didn't want to go to war with CEOs.

349
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,360
I was just exhausted by being an antagonist.

350
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,720
I thought, I'm never going to go on a board again unless the CEO wants me there.

351
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,720
But I did that for a while.

352
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I learned a lot.

353
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,240
I made a little bit of money, but I was in my early 40s and quite frankly, just trying

354
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,000
to figure out a way to make a living so I could stay in New York, which isn't easy.

355
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,800
And I think I was flailing a little bit, but it was a great experience.

356
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,200
I learned a lot about human nature, about shareholders, about governance.

357
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,320
I get called a lot by boards when they're being challenged by an activist because I

358
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,320
was one.

359
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,200
And I think I have some insight into how these people think.

360
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:47,040
But yeah, it was just a strange time in my life, but it was interesting.

361
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
It was fun.

362
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,640
I just wasn't very good at it.

363
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
Yeah, that's cool.

364
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,960
I had a bunch of different careers and I like that.

365
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
I like variety.

366
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,320
I like people who have different chapters and sagas of their life.

367
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,080
And you mentioned your 20s are for figuring out what you actually like to do or what you're

368
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,160
actually good at or the intersection between those two.

369
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:11,840
It sounds like yours went past your 20s and you just kept experimenting along the way.

370
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,720
Is that a fair assessment for you?

371
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,240
Yeah, investment banking, no good at it.

372
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,960
Human School started a brand strategy firm called Profit, grew it to a couple hundred

373
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,400
people, sold it for $33 million.

374
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,400
What do I want to do?

375
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
I know I want to teach.

376
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:35,200
The .com implosion took me from what I thought was being wealthy to not being wealthy.

377
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,520
Teaching wasn't going to help me maintain the lifestyle I needed or wanted to maintain

378
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:44,360
with two young kids in New York, so I needed to find other ways to make money.

379
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:49,640
I did the hedge fund thing for a while, did boards, and then saw an opportunity in analytics

380
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,720
and benchmarking and started that company, I think O9 or O10, and that was my big win.

381
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,120
And the timing is everything.

382
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,720
I got swept up into what is the greatest bull market economy in history.

383
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,800
08 to present is probably going to go down as the greatest extended bull market run

384
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,440
in history.

385
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,480
People don't understand just what an anomaly the last 16 years have been relative to the

386
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,560
history of the market.

387
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,320
And just as I was coming into my prime income earning years, the wins just filled up my sales.

388
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,240
And I finally got all the moons sort of lined up, if you will.

389
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,520
But I've always said, you got to be humble when things work because a lot of your success

390
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,040
isn't your fault.

391
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,400
At the same time, I wish I had been more forgiving of myself when things didn't work

392
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,820
because I have trouble forgiving myself.

393
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:49,000
I struggle with anger, and the person I get most angry at is myself, and I have trouble

394
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
getting past shit.

395
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,480
I was at a book thing last night, and I said something, and it just came out wrong, and

396
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,640
I'm sitting in bed, and I can't get past that one thing.

397
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,240
It went really well, but I can't think that way.

398
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,320
I focus on what's wrong.

399
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,400
And that would be my advice to people is be humble when you have wins because a lot of

400
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,200
it isn't you, but also forgive yourself because, again, a lot of it isn't you.

401
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,120
My roommate in college had the poem If by I think Richard Kipling on his wall, and one

402
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,680
of the great lines of that poem is, if you can meet triumph and disaster and treat those

403
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:28,320
two imposters just the same, and that's always stuck with me.

404
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,920
That's kind of what you're talking about.

405
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,360
Your greatest triumphs, maintaining the humility, and then in your greatest failures, not beating

406
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,560
yourself up too much.

407
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:42,560
You're a big proponent of stoicism, and that seems like a pretty stoic way to be.

408
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:46,480
Give us the like, there's a lot of people listening to this right now that may be familiar

409
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,040
with stoicism, don't practice, don't kind of know how it applies to their life.

410
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,040
Make your pitch.

411
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,880
Why stoicism matters to somebody?

412
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,960
Well, just your own mental and emotional health, and Ryan Holiday is kind of my Yoda

413
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,320
on stoicism, and he distills it this way.

414
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,240
Life is not about what happens to you.

415
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,320
You can't control that, but you can't control how you respond to what happens to you.

416
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:17,320
And I've tried to always remember that, and I have trouble practicing it, but the ultimate

417
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:22,720
stoicism piece of art in modern history or modern media is Brokeback Mountain.

418
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,680
If you can't fix it, you've got to stand it.

419
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,080
And that is try and focus on the things you can control, and you can control your emotions.

420
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,440
It's very difficult to control what happens to you.

421
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,280
And just also recognize, and this is more atheism than stoicism, everyone on this podcast,

422
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,560
everyone we know, everyone we care about, what they think of us, they're going to be

423
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,600
dead in a hundred years.

424
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:56,120
In a blink of the history, nothing you say or do or what anyone else thinks of you is

425
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:00,880
going to matter for very long, and something that really has helped me when I was embarrassed

426
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,440
or I thought I didn't equip myself very well is what you realize is just imagine yourself

427
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,920
when someone says or does something stupid, you think to yourself, oh, that was stupid.

428
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,280
And then you go back to thinking about yourself.

429
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:19,520
And people aren't thinking about you, your wealth, your failures, your successes as much

430
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,040
as you are.

431
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,600
And so the key is just trying to be comfortable with yourself and comfortable in your own

432
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,600
skin.

433
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,320
And not only that, really kind of focus on what your spouse thinks of you.

434
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,360
Is your spouse happy?

435
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,160
Do you have a good relationship with your kids?

436
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,280
Because what Twitter thinks of you really isn't that important.

437
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,400
And because I had so much trouble actually footing my emotions to that logical notion,

438
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,760
I know it doesn't matter what people on Twitter or the Twitter mob think of me, but I couldn't

439
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,040
emotionally separate myself from it.

440
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,160
I don't have those skills.

441
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,400
So a role model of mine is again, Sam Harris.

442
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,000
He's like, oh, I got off Twitter.

443
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I can't handle that.

444
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,520
He's like, why don't you get off of Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I can.

445
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,320
So I stopped, I'm off of Twitter for the last nine months and it's been one of the most

446
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,120
accretive things to my mental health.

447
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,080
And I didn't like to admit this, but I would say five or six weekends where I just got

448
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,680
really bummed out by something, probably two or three of them started on Twitter.

449
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:20,480
I thought, why am I on something that's making me on a regular basis upset?

450
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,720
And there's an addictive nature to it.

451
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,760
I think it must be just, and that's what freaks me out.

452
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,280
I can modulate it.

453
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,840
You know, can my 13 year old son?

454
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,960
Do I even know that he's upset when he goes, we have a rule in my house that our boys

455
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,360
aren't allowed to go into their rooms or their phones alone?

456
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,960
Because I think this thing can literally take a teenager, especially a teenager girl, down

457
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,760
a rabbit hole and kind of zero to 60 really fast and then start serving her content.

458
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,240
Oh, you're worried about dieting?

459
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,960
Well, here's extreme dieting tips, despite the fact we know you're 5'10", 95 pounds.

460
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,440
Oh, you're depressed?

461
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,280
Well, here are some videos of people considering suicide.

462
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,800
We're going to normalize it for you.

463
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,440
And I don't think parents are really in touch with just how ugly and how fast it gets really

464
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,440
ugly.

465
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:11,480
So, you know, I'm trying to be very thoughtful about what it is as a stoicism, controlling

466
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,000
what I can't control, and then trying to be in better touch with my emotions and recognize

467
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,040
that when you're down, it's more about the chemistry in your head than any legitimate

468
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,440
reason to be down.

469
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,200
You're going to look at the end of life, the biggest regrets.

470
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,960
My colleague at NYU, Adam Alter, did great research on people who are very near death

471
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,080
and palliative care.

472
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,560
And their biggest regrets are one, they'd wish they'd stayed in better touch with friends.

473
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,440
They wish they'd lived the life they wanted to lead, not the life society or their parents

474
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,360
wanted them to lead.

475
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,760
Their biggest regret is they wish they'd been less hard on themselves.

476
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,040
They wish they'd forgiven themselves.

477
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:53,200
They wish they'd allowed themselves to be happy.

478
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,880
And that's kind of been, that's something I've been very focused on.

479
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,120
It's like, okay, stop beating yourself up, you're going to be dead soon.

480
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:05,800
Why wouldn't you squeeze as much juice out of this lemon as conceivable and like afford

481
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,080
yourself the opportunity to be happy and be sad if you need to be.

482
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,880
But I think of stoicism as, again, life isn't about what happens to you, it's how you respond

483
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:19,600
to what happens to you and decide what is in your control and, you know, try and be

484
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,840
good to yourself, try and forgive yourself and also just try and be humble.

485
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:28,400
You are never more prone to a really big mistake than right after a big win.

486
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,060
Because here's the thing, you start thinking you're good at picking stocks.

487
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,920
You start thinking you're so skilled at work, it wasn't that someone senior to you took

488
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,200
an interest in you and championed you.

489
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,920
You start thinking, oh, I'm great at real estate.

490
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,080
I just didn't get lucky and buy a home at the right time.

491
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:51,600
So be, try and just try and ignore the market when the market tells you you're a failure.

492
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
And this is personal, too.

493
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,160
You know, there's been moments in my life where I thought, I don't think I'm ever going

494
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,560
to be able to work again.

495
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,600
I think I've ruined everything.

496
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,080
I don't think I'm ever going to make a very good living.

497
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,880
I remember thinking, saying to my partner at the time, let's move to a low-cost neighborhood,

498
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,720
a Charlottesville or a Raleigh Derm.

499
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,800
I'm going to teach, try and write, you know, make decent livings and just have a really

500
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
nice life.

501
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,320
And my partner's like, that's giving up.

502
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
I'm like, well, it's not giving up, but I thought this is it.

503
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,000
I just need to substantially downgrade my expectations.

504
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,600
And I don't mean to say that that's not a great life.

505
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,520
I remember thinking after my divorce, like, I don't think I'm ever going to have someone

506
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,360
who I can share my life with again.

507
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,960
I'm like, this just is never going to happen to me.

508
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm an unattractive, broken man who's never going to find like a partner again.

509
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,920
I believe that for a short time.

510
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:48,640
And I think that it's important that everybody recognize that, you know, you are the answer

511
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,520
to a firm's problem.

512
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,800
You can find someone who you can love and is going to love you a great deal.

513
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,360
The key is getting up, putting in yourself in a place of success, getting out of the

514
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,480
house, being friendly, being risk aggressive, surrounding yourself with people and exercise

515
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,320
and nutrition that makes you feel good about yourself, such that when the winds kick up

516
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,200
again, your sales are up.

517
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,240
And I've always tried to do that.

518
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:20,040
I've had a lot of failure, but I was always had my sales up, such that when the winds

519
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,480
kicked up again, I was in a position to rumble, so to speak, because I know a lot of people

520
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:31,240
who are very successful and then they hit some failure, a personal failure, a death of a parent

521
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,520
they can't quite get over, a divorce, a company that fails, and they get stuck.

522
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,880
They can't forgive themselves.

523
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,040
They can't forgive others.

524
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,120
They can't forgive the market.

525
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,320
Or they lose their mojo, whatever it is, and two, three, five years, seven years goes

526
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,360
on and they just haven't progressed.

527
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,160
And they start, their skills start atrophying.

528
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,680
Their confidence starts atrophying.

529
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,520
So what I say is put a statute of limit.

530
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,520
Whenever anything bad happens to you, you got to put a statute of limitations on it.

531
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,920
A parent dies, you know, within 12 weeks, you should still be sad and thinking about

532
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,000
your parents, but you should be able to, you should be able to function.

533
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,520
You know, you go through a real emotional trauma or a breakup, well, how serious was

534
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
it?

535
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
How much time?

536
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,520
What's the statute of limitations?

537
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,480
A business goes out of business, okay, mourn for a little while.

538
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
What is that?

539
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
Two months?

540
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,480
Three months?

541
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,760
But if you are better, if you are back sending out emails, trying to raise money, going out

542
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,260
trying to meet new people, whatever it might be within that timeline, you need to reach

543
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,020
out for help and get unstuck.

544
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:45,460
Because time goes really fast and your skills atrophy in a sort of a downward spiral.

545
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,140
And something I've always been able to do is mourn and move on.

546
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,420
Churchill said the key to success is the ability to move through failure without losing your

547
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,920
sense of enthusiasm.

548
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,900
And I've tried, I've been pretty good at not losing my sense of enthusiasm.

549
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:01,580
You're, you know, you've got brilliant ideas.

550
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,940
I think you're a good business person, but you talk about not just following your passion,

551
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
but your talent.

552
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,900
And I think that what you're most talented at is communication.

553
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,500
I've seen you speak live, I've seen you, I listened to the pod, I've seen your videos.

554
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:20,300
You do such a good job at picking really sharp words and sharp phrases and just small examples

555
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,300
like accoutrement.

556
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,180
I've noticed that you love that word and I've never heard anyone use it as much as you.

557
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,340
And I'm like, oh, I love that word.

558
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,740
The one who uses that word, it's a beautiful word.

559
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,020
Or you sign your emails with, uh, uh, life is rich.

560
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,460
Like you've, you've got beautiful phrases.

561
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,260
I think that, uh, I even, by the way, I even had a chat, GBT, right?

562
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,540
Uploaded like 150 of your blogs and I would ask it questions to like help give me like

563
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:44,700
ideas for phrases because you're really good at that.

564
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,180
Who do you steal from when it comes to, or who you inspired from when it comes to language?

565
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:51,740
I mean, you seem like someone, if I had to guess, like you're a George Carlin guy, something

566
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
like that.

567
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,780
Who do you steal like some of your delivery from or inspired by for writing because you're

568
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:57,780
really good.

569
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,180
And do you have like a, a bank of like, when you see a phrase, you're like, Oh, I'm going

570
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,100
to take that phrase and use that somewhere.

571
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,580
If you don't have a kitchen cabinet of people that you learn enough about that you can mimic

572
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,580
them, you're trying to play a team sport.

573
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,220
So, uh, you're on the field alone and I didn't figure that out till I was older.

574
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,620
So I absolutely, when I see something inspiring, I breathe maybe one book a year.

575
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,620
People think I'm well read.

576
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,340
I'm not, but I'll find a book that's really meaningful and I'll try and read it two or

577
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,380
three times so I can adopt it into my gray matter.

578
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,420
Daniel Kahneman's thinking slow and fast.

579
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,420
I've read that book a few times and I know everything about loss aversion theory.

580
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,340
I know a lot about the relationship between money and happiness.

581
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,900
I read observations of a bite standard by Peter Drucker.

582
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,980
I read Sapient several times.

583
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:49,060
I want to like really, really, you know, embed stuff lately I'd write down things in my phone

584
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:54,860
that I just think are fucking hilarious, like jokes, you know, I wrote down something today

585
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:58,060
as a prank when my doctor walks in, I put on gloves.

586
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,180
I'm going to try that.

587
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,180
I love my doctor.

588
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:05,460
I love the idea of him walking in and me snapping on gloves just to see his reaction.

589
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,780
We were talking about Trump today and I saw this great quote that said consequences rarely

590
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,080
show up lubed.

591
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,580
I love that.

592
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:18,540
Um, I just, whenever I see something that really, I just think, you know, I love going

593
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,420
out in the public, except for the fact that the public is there.

594
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:25,780
You see these things every day and I will write them down and incorporate them into

595
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:31,420
my rap and especially great phrases, you know, greatness is in the agency of others.

596
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,940
I remember my VC said that I'm like, that just makes so much goddamn sense.

597
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:38,420
I'm going to use that over and over and over.

598
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,020
So I have a lot of inspiration.

599
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,380
Um, I surround myself with really intelligent young people.

600
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,100
I know that's ages, but I think young people have a different frame on things that help

601
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
me.

602
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,300
So, but to not, to not sort of, if you're just reading something and not, you don't

603
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,700
take away stuff you're going to remember, you haven't really read it.

604
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:00,620
You haven't really absorbed it, but it's all, all manner of stuff.

605
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,580
I think, um, um, you're, you're right.

606
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,180
I'm totally inspired by George Carlin.

607
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,780
I think he's fantastic on society.

608
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,300
I've been inspired by Ricky Treve, so I'm inspired by this comedian named Michelle

609
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Wolf.

610
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,140
I think she's fantastic, but yeah, I've read a lot about Muhammad Ali.

611
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:20,660
I think he's, you know, be courageous, be poetic, but yeah, absolutely every young

612
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:24,820
person should find a couple of people they find really inspiring and try and learn everything

613
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:30,380
about them and what they said, such that you can kind of turn on your Muhammad Ali.

614
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,700
And you know, Madeleine Albright, secretary of state, you know, four foot 10, I find her

615
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,340
inspiring around pub policy or so on geopolitics, so I've read a lot about her.

616
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,620
Our, you know, our memory is long and our reach is far.

617
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,620
I love that.

618
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:48,460
She used to say that about America to its enemies, right?

619
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,220
Basically a really eloquent way of saying, don't fuck with us boys.

620
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:58,580
And I just love that this four 10 woman only in America can wield, you know, the most powerful

621
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,260
nation in the world in terms of our foreign policy abroad.

622
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,580
And I found her and she was an immigrant.

623
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,900
I just found her inspiring, so I wanted to learn more about her so I could be her on

624
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,900
occasion.

625
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,300
Anyways, yeah, build a kitchen cabinet of people.

626
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,740
It's got, I got a, my notes app here, it's called funny phrases and I just, I collect

627
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
these.

628
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,820
I'll give you, I'll give you three of my funny phrases on here because they're completely

629
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:18,820
out of context.

630
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,940
So you won't get it, but you'll get it because you do sounds like you do this too.

631
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,500
When somebody's thick, you could say that they're built like a baguette.

632
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
I like that.

633
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,660
Somebody's got the body of a baguette.

634
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:31,260
Okay, next one.

635
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,580
If you want to talk about something that other people are avoiding, you say, look, I'm

636
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,860
going to address this like an envelope right now.

637
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,660
That's a dad joke.

638
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:48,060
Another one would be for CEOs who have bad, you know, a terrible sense of vision of the

639
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,060
future.

640
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:53,340
If this CEO was the shooter at JFK, he would have died of natural causes.

641
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,300
I love these little, little isms, little phrases, little sentences.

642
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,780
You're going to lose this game.

643
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,540
Okay, so he looks like a suicide bomber that's having second thoughts.

644
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,500
This is more serious.

645
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
I absolutely, I absolutely love this one.

646
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,340
This is more true life advice.

647
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:15,340
Your goal isn't to get the apology, but to forgive the perceived debt.

648
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,500
I love that.

649
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,500
I love that.

650
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,860
Just think down, this is really bad.

651
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,220
Teaching my son about sex ads.

652
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,500
So I walked into his room with a banana in a condom and he said, what's the banana for?

653
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:31,060
And I said, I can't get hard on an empty stomach.

654
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:34,300
I literally think that's the funniest fucking.

655
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,540
That just hit Sam.

656
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,300
I literally just hit Sam.

657
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:42,300
I just think that's so inappropriate and so anyways, sorry guys.

658
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,700
All right, I'm not going to, this is like getting into a rap battle with Tupac.

659
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,180
I'm not, I'm not going to, I'm going to put away my swipe file right here, even though

660
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,180
I just had a good one.

661
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,180
There you go.

662
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,180
I'm going to give up.

663
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,180
You win.

664
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,260
What are you excited about right now?

665
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:58,900
Like what are some things that are going on in the world or products or ideas or trends?

666
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:02,620
Like, you know, I think you talk a lot about like, you know, stuff that's wrong with America,

667
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:05,420
with the world, culture, with society, but I want to know the opposite.

668
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,940
What are you, what are you pumped about?

669
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
That's not easier for me.

670
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,100
I mean, to be blunt, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy.

671
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,260
I think a lot about loneliness.

672
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,780
I think a lot about struggling young men.

673
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,900
I think about the threats of AI.

674
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,900
What am I excited about?

675
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,780
I have a work with a really talented group of people that are really inspiring.

676
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,700
I love the work we're doing.

677
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,260
I mean, I just really enjoy it.

678
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,100
I get to travel a lot with my kids.

679
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:34,660
I got kids that are at a great age and I get to do a ton of fun stuff with them.

680
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,980
It's really intoxicating.

681
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:42,060
You know, I'm just, I get to have a really nice life at this point and I'm just enjoying

682
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:48,860
it with a partner, just really leaning into my kids, you know, just the hallmark shit.

683
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:55,620
I'm just really having a nice time with the people closest to me and I'm healthy.

684
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:00,420
I got good, healthy kids, you know, the boring stuff, man.

685
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:04,620
It's not anything kind of, I mean, I'm going, I'm on my book tour.

686
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:09,020
This week I go to LA for Bill Maher and then I'm meeting a bunch of college buddies and

687
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:13,380
I'm going to stagecoach and then I go to Miami for a bunch of speaking gigs and then I go

688
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,380
home to London.

689
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:19,220
I mean, I just have a, I have a really nice life right now and everyone I care about is

690
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,840
healthy.

691
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,100
I feel relevant.

692
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,180
So I just have such a wonderful life and I'm trying to slow time down so I can really

693
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:31,780
appreciate it because, you know, there's no getting around it.

694
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:38,460
I had lunch with Ted Sarandos, which I realized is a name drop, but I'm desperate for your

695
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,660
guys' affirmation, but his wife wrote a book on grief and there's this great line, she

696
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:49,980
has this great line and that is grief is love's receipts and I just love that.

697
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:53,700
I just, if you really care about, I didn't have a lot of grief until the age of 40 and

698
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,340
I realized it was because there was no one in my life that I really loved or really loved

699
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,900
me other than my mom.

700
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,500
And so, you know, what I would bless or wish for anybody is they have a lot of grief in

701
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,940
their life because what it means is they have loss and when you have loss, it's because

702
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:11,300
you had something wonderful in your life and you miss it.

703
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:17,660
So I'm just trying to appreciate how just nice things are and really, you know, I don't,

704
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:21,460
you know, I'm not really excited about, you know, the Euro finals in Germany, although

705
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:25,900
I am excited about the European finals in Germany, but I'm just, I'm just enjoying myself.

706
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,420
And so, I'm rounding third.

707
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,020
I have a really nice life right now.

708
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm just trying to enjoy it because I know everything everywhere ends.

709
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:36,980
What do you say for people who are not rounding third?

710
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,660
Like people who are, you know, just batting lead off right now.

711
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,760
So you talk a lot to young people.

712
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:47,180
One of the phrases I really liked or one of the quotes I really liked was that opportunity

713
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,300
is a function of density.

714
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,580
You said, yeah, get to a place that is crowded with success.

715
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:53,580
What do you mean by that?

716
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,940
Seems like really good advice for people.

717
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,180
Well, and sort of the motivation for the book was, you know, that study that you are kind

718
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,420
of the average of your five closest friends, that there's this weird study that peer group,

719
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,460
the five people you hang out with, you end up being the same body mass index.

720
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,860
You same, end up with similar political values, same jobs, same neighborhood.

721
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,340
It means it's weird, you become the same person.

722
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,900
What's different though with this greater variance is that of those five people, even

723
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,140
though they make kind of similar incomes, one will end up poor, three will be okay and

724
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,460
one will end up quite wealthy.

725
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,220
And I tried to understand the behaviors that are different and the strategies between the

726
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:36,180
person that ends up financially secure and the others that are less financially secure.

727
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,580
And there's some general best practices around youth.

728
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,380
You absolutely want to get to a city.

729
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,460
If you're ambitious, I'm not suggesting this is the right way.

730
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
It's just my way.

731
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,700
If you're ambitious and you want to have influencer economic security, before you collect

732
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,260
dogs and kids, you got to get to a city.

733
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,260
Two thirds of economic growth is going to happen in just 20 cities.

734
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,540
And so if you're really ambitious and get to the biggest city in your nation, then get

735
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:02,300
to London if you're in Europe or New York in the U.S. or if you're in Texas, San Francisco

736
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,620
because those cities are really competitive and you're going to be playing, you know how

737
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:12,020
when you play tennis against players better than you, your game elevates.

738
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:15,380
When you're in a big city, you're playing against the best players in the world.

739
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,380
It's hard to live in Brooklyn.

740
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,300
It's expensive, which means you got to be really good at what you do and you're surrounded

741
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:25,820
by people who are going to inspire you and who are really will elevate your game.

742
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,220
And at some point you'll probably have to move out of the city because it's difficult

743
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,220
with kids.

744
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:36,020
But while you're young, get to a big city, try and find really high character successful

745
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,100
people to hang out with.

746
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:43,300
Just find people you want to be like or that you admire professionally and personally

747
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:47,740
and try and establish those friendships and try and hang out with them because you rise

748
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:50,980
or fall to the level of your peer group.

749
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:55,260
And the thing about cities is you're just bumping off opportunities.

750
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,820
And I've moved to London and my reductive analysis of the U.S. versus Europe is the

751
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:04,460
U.S. is still the best place to make money, Europe's the best place to spend it.

752
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:08,740
So if you're in the making money part of your life, it's hard to beat the U.S. I didn't

753
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,660
appreciate the American economy until I left it.

754
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,860
Let's start from yesterday.

755
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
How can we work together?

756
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,660
How can we build something together?

757
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,740
How can we make money together?

758
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,220
London is sort of like a very polite, indefinite maybe.

759
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:24,580
There's very little actual organic value creation in London.

760
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:28,540
It's people servicing other people's wealth that they made elsewhere.

761
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:33,820
There's nothing like America that says to a young person, if you work your ass off and

762
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:39,940
you're really good and you get a little bit lucky, things can happen for you here.

763
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,540
All my British friends, they say that they grew up being afraid of tall poppy syndrome,

764
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:48,020
meaning they didn't want to stick out because their teachers would tell them, shut the hell

765
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,660
up, get in line.

766
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:54,740
Whereas in America, if you do something interesting, even if you fail, you're rewarded as being

767
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,420
a hero of like, well, that's awesome, man.

768
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,420
You got after it.

769
00:40:57,420 --> 00:41:00,540
Even if it sucked, the outcome wasn't good.

770
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,300
We praise you for getting after it.

771
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,540
And I think that's a very unique American thing compared to Europe.

772
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,780
In Europe, if you stick out, you're chastised.

773
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:11,940
Not only that, but people say in America, we embrace failure.

774
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
That's not true.

775
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,900
But we do tolerate it.

776
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,180
And so only one out of seven businesses succeed.

777
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,660
So my strategy has been to start nine businesses.

778
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:24,620
And I got to two wins, and all you need is one.

779
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,740
And if you aren't trying really hard and taking risks and failing and then knowing to pull

780
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:34,140
the plug and move on, you're not taking advantage of the American embrace of risk and failure.

781
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,900
I've never had trouble raising money because of past failures.

782
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,900
People didn't mind that.

783
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,100
As long as you treated your investor as well, as long as you were a decent person, you didn't

784
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:47,900
do anything stupid or unethical, people don't have a problem funding you again.

785
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:54,780
I've had a lot of failure professionally, but I've never had, let me put it this way,

786
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,380
when I couldn't raise money, it wasn't because I had failed before.

787
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,460
And that's true in relationships.

788
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:05,980
So yeah, the embrace or the acceptance of failure in America is, it's singular and it's

789
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:06,980
a wonderful thing.

790
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:09,540
And if you aren't trying and taking a lot of riskier, you aren't taking advantage of

791
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,660
an economy that's one of the few in the world, one of the few societies.

792
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,540
I mean, if I was born in China, I'd probably be in jail because I'm outspoken and say stupid

793
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:18,780
things.

794
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:23,460
If I was born in Europe, I think I'd be a talented business person, but I wouldn't be

795
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,460
an entrepreneur that had recognized this success because they don't embrace failure or that's

796
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,460
wrong.

797
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,620
Can I ask you a question about hard work?

798
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:39,940
And the reason being is I found some, what read as contrary things in your work, or at

799
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:42,180
least in your story and what you write.

800
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,020
And so Sean and I have talked a lot about this, about hard work.

801
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,380
And I think people who say they work 80 hours a week for a really long time, I think they're

802
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:53,500
either lying or they did a lot of bullshit work.

803
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,620
I think it's to work 80 hours a week for an extended period of time, it's incredibly

804
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,620
challenging.

805
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,140
You talked about, in this book, as well as some of the other blog posts, you're saying,

806
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,140
in my 40s, I grinded my ass off, all I was focused on was money, and it worked out, but

807
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,140
that's all I did.

808
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,940
And I'm happy I did it, but it was really hard work.

809
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,500
But then I read about how you delegate a ton.

810
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:20,980
I think you said something even as crazy as you have someone pick out your clothes and

811
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:22,220
you wear mostly the same thing.

812
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,060
You have your workout outfit and then your work outfit.

813
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:31,540
And how you at Prophecy Media, you said something like, you only meet with your executive producer

814
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,540
twice a month.

815
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,260
You only have one hour meeting once a week with the editorial team.

816
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:42,020
You haven't planned vacations in 20 years, and all you do is focus on a handful of things.

817
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,620
But even though you're crazy productive now, I don't know, are you still grinding and looking

818
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,700
back knowing what you know now?

819
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,340
Could you have gotten to where you've gotten without that 80 hour a week for multiple years

820
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,340
of work ethic?

821
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,660
Well, things have changed dramatically for me now.

822
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,180
I'm not working nearly as hard.

823
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,620
And I hire a lot of people and I'll over, not over hire, but everyone works hard.

824
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:09,940
But I don't, I mean, when you have a small business and you don't have a lot of money,

825
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,460
you know, you just, you got to get, everyone needs, you need to work hard.

826
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:18,060
You need to set an example and you need to create an environment where everyone's working

827
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
hard.

828
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,060
I'm not sure I was ever working 80 hours a week consistently.

829
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,620
I definitely had weeks like that.

830
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:29,900
But when I look back on it, kind of, I don't know, 10, 20, 10, 15 years, I don't remember

831
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,540
much else other than work.

832
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:35,420
I mean, I worked out when I had kids, I tried to spend some time with my kids.

833
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:40,060
I still found time for fun and vacations, but, you know, I would vacation two weeks

834
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
a year.

835
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,780
Now I vacation a lot more than that.

836
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,100
And, but I don't see any way around it.

837
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,700
It's really, my kids, when I say my kids, my students, I'll ask them how much money they

838
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:55,380
expect to be making by the time they're 35 and about 90% of them expect to be in the

839
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,340
top 1%, which is $750,000 a year in America.

840
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:02,140
And then they'll talk about that.

841
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
Like that's what I expect.

842
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,580
But I'll say, what's most important to you in your life and moving forward?

843
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:08,540
And a lot of the time they say balance.

844
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:14,420
And I'm like, so you expect to be in the top 1% by the time you're 35, but you also believe

845
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,420
you're going to have balance in your life?

846
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,220
I mean, I don't, I've never seen that.

847
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,220
I don't.

848
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,220
You can have it all.

849
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,700
You just can't have it all at once.

850
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,340
And by the way, that's, that may not be the way to go.

851
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,580
You may sacrifice, you may say, I want to live a nice kind of balanced life.

852
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,180
I'm going to move to a suburb of St. Louis, coach Little League, work 40 hours a week,

853
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:38,900
be a good citizen, find a good partner, you know, coach Little League, have a nice life.

854
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,900
Nothing wrong with that.

855
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:42,860
But the majority of the people I know, the young people, think they're going to be in

856
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:45,220
the top 1% and also have balance in their life.

857
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,220
And I just, it's ridiculous.

858
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,460
I'm like, okay, the only way to get there to achieve that is if you have one thing and

859
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:57,180
that's rich parents, otherwise expect to go all in on your career or scale back your expectations

860
00:45:57,180 --> 00:46:01,420
around your economics and your influence because it's a competitive market.

861
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:05,140
And one of the things people can control is how hard they work.

862
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:09,780
I don't think you want to, I don't think you want to work so much that you sacrifice your

863
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,180
health or your relationships.

864
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:14,060
There is going to be some trade off with your relationships.

865
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,140
I didn't see my kids a lot when they were little.

866
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,140
I was divorced.

867
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,780
I think it was a contributor to that.

868
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,380
I was always working in services companies and never saying no to any opportunity.

869
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:26,380
The CMO of Samsung, can you be in Seoul tomorrow for a board meeting?

870
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,380
Sure I can.

871
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,820
You know, I mean, I just said yes to everything to try and move the company forward.

872
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:41,700
But I, for a long period, worked very, very hard and sacrificed a lot and it takes a toll.

873
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,460
And I did it such that I could have a lot more balance now.

874
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,420
But yeah, I don't, this notion, the myth of balance, get over it.

875
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,460
If you expect to be influential or economically secure, you're not going to have a lot of

876
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,420
balance for a long period of time.

877
00:46:56,420 --> 00:47:00,860
Some people are such geniuses that they can work a modest amount of time, make a lot of

878
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:06,420
money, work out, have a great relationship with their parents, be fit, donate time at

879
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:11,100
the ASPCA and have a food blog, assume you are not that person.

880
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,740
So just have a sober conversation and also have a sober conversation with your partner.

881
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,500
How much money do we expect to have?

882
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,940
Who's responsible for making it?

883
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,900
What's your approach to spending?

884
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,780
Where are we going to live?

885
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:28,980
The number one source of divorce is not infidelity or lack of shared values.

886
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,180
It's usually got something to do with money and also 70% of divorce filings are filed

887
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,740
by women who still, and we don't like to say this because we like to pretend women have

888
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:41,340
no agency and that they're just doughy little foes.

889
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,780
The man loses a business, becomes broke or has a mental breakdown.

890
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:54,420
When a man loses a status as a provider, he's very inclined to be on the wrong end of divorce.

891
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,660
So I think a lot about young men.

892
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,140
I think a lot about financial security.

893
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,980
I think every man should start with the notion that he's going to be responsible for the

894
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,380
economic well-being of his household.

895
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:07,500
And by the way, sometimes that means getting out of the way and being more supportive of

896
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,100
your partner who happens to be better at that money thing than you.

897
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,540
And that's a wonderful thing.

898
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:20,500
But start from a position of this is my responsibility and make sure you're aligned with your partner

899
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,580
around this stuff because the thing we don't talk about is that your kids are going to

900
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,380
have higher blood pressure if you're economically strained.

901
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:33,100
Kids in low-income households have greater systolic resting blood pressure than kids

902
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,060
in middle and upper-income homes.

903
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,740
You're much more likely to get divorced.

904
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,780
You're much more likely to have a stroke.

905
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,380
You're much more likely to be the victim or the perpetrator of domestic violence when

906
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,020
you don't have money.

907
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,340
You know, America becomes more like itself every day.

908
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:50,540
And that is it's a loving, generous place for people with money.

909
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:54,300
It's a rapacious, violent place for people who don't have money.

910
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:59,340
So all this bullshit that money doesn't buy you happiness, oh my God, is that a myth?

911
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:04,140
I'm not saying you need to be incredibly wealthy, but middle-income people are happier than

912
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:07,660
poor people and wealthy people are happier than middle-income people.

913
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,660
That's the bad news.

914
00:49:08,660 --> 00:49:10,860
The good news is that it tops out.

915
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:12,860
You get diminishing returns.

916
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:18,580
And you have to be cognizant of when you do get to some level of economic security, that's

917
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:19,980
the means.

918
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:26,940
The ends is such that you can have an exhale, release the anxiety that you feel, and then

919
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:32,380
use the opportunity to really spend a lot of time with your loved ones and cement those

920
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:33,940
relationships.

921
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,540
And the problem is you get on the sadonic treadmill and you get so absorbed in your

922
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,780
own success and your professional identity and money and making more money that you never

923
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,260
get to the ends.

924
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,660
You wake up a wealthy person or someone who's financially secure as I always thought about

925
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,500
their economic well-being, and you don't really have a great relationship with your kids or

926
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,620
you never really leaned into your partnership and thought, okay, let's take time to really

927
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:57,060
enjoy each other's company.

928
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:59,100
Let's do nice things.

929
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,820
Your parents die before you have a chance to really spend time with them as adults.

930
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:05,980
I think that happens to a lot of people.

931
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:09,820
They just get so caught up and I need the next promotion.

932
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,420
I need the next amount of money.

933
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,900
And once I get here, I have someone very close to my life.

934
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,620
It's a family member and I'm taking them to Africa and they're like making excuses, but

935
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,140
our kids in the choir, they weren't making excuses.

936
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,500
I'm like, you realize this is your last chance to go to Africa before you're dead, right?

937
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,220
You're 50 fucking years old.

938
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,140
When do you go when you're 70?

939
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,180
But you got to get back to work an extra day.

940
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,900
I mean, what are you thinking?

941
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,580
We're going to be dead soon.

942
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:41,980
And I just think so many people don't realize how fast it's going to go by and never really,

943
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:47,420
never really like super, not only super lean into the relationships, but just allow themselves

944
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,940
just to have a great time.

945
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,380
I'm going to stagecoach this week.

946
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,140
I'm going to go to country music festival.

947
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,100
I can't stand country, but I'm going.

948
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,940
I'm going to buy a pair of boots.

949
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,620
I'm going to have a great time and I'm going to do an edible and I'm going to drink a Chiton

950
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,940
and I'm going to have arrested adolescents with my friends and I'm going to look ridiculous.

951
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,140
And it's like, yeah, why not?

952
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,460
Why the fuck not?

953
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,020
What am I going to do?

954
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,380
Watch C-SPAN all weekend?

955
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:19,100
I mean, anyway, I can't stand it when people who are blessed with being in this country

956
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,540
have some level of economic security, have people in their life that love them and they

957
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:28,780
love and they don't like crazy lean into it because you guys are younger than I can.

958
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:30,660
It just goes so goddamn fast.

959
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
It's just crazy.

960
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,820
It is just crazy how fast it goes.

961
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,820
Anyways.

962
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,700
Well, I don't know how to respond to that, Scott.

963
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,940
Here's what I do know.

964
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:44,860
I feel like I learned something and I feel a little bit bad inside at the same time.

965
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:49,860
I feel a little bit good and you made me feel a little bit bad and I need to go and I need

966
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,580
to like burp or something.

967
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,500
I need to get a little bit out of my system.

968
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,140
I just need to unwind from that.

969
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,020
Do they not have Zoloft in London?

970
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:00,540
You know, I haven't hit the anti-depressant.

971
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,980
I just had ketamine therapy though.

972
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:02,980
That was a trip.

973
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:08,020
No, I'm trying to, I'm trying to just, you know, like the good news is I hate my life

974
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:13,300
less and less every day, so I'm sort of getting there.

975
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,860
I'm sort of getting there.

976
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:19,260
You're like if Mitch Hedberg had a podcast and opened an LLC.

977
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,980
Are we going to talk about, are we going to talk about my book?

978
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:26,540
Do you think I got to number one talking about like doing therapy with you guys on these

979
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,140
Joey Baganonas podcast?

980
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,420
Are you going to bring up my book?

981
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,420
Yeah.

982
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,420
Tell us about the book.

983
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,420
Okay.

984
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,420
We talked a little bit about the book, but tell us the floor is yours.

985
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,420
Make your case as to what I'm going to get out of this book because I'm going to buy

986
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,420
it and I'm going to read it.

987
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,420
Okay.

988
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,420
Thanks for that.

989
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,740
It's a different level of enthusiasm if you give me a little teaser of what I'm going

990
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,740
to get out of it.

991
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,740
Okay.

992
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:49,300
So the algebra of wealth is the following.

993
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:55,340
Find your talent, focus, workshop your 20s in an industry that will pay you.

994
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:59,420
Once you have a certain amount of momentum professionally, really try and develop a savings

995
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:00,420
muscle.

996
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,260
Wealth isn't about how much you make, it's about how much you spend.

997
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,220
Try and just get to the point at a fairly early stage where you spend less than you

998
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,220
make.

999
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:08,220
That is very difficult.

1000
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:11,740
The brightest companies and minds in the world are all here to convince you that an

1001
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:16,060
upgrade from economy to economy comfort, to economy plus, to business classes and investment

1002
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:17,060
in yourself.

1003
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,380
No, it's not.

1004
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,380
It's consumption.

1005
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,900
Don't try and impress other people with your shit.

1006
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,820
No one's as concerned with your shit as you are.

1007
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,460
You don't need to order a bottle of vodka at a club for 450 bucks.

1008
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,940
Get a Hyundai for God's sakes.

1009
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,060
Travel coach.

1010
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,060
Save money.

1011
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:33,060
Start saving money early.

1012
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,060
Lean in.

1013
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:36,420
If you're young, lean into your advantage and that is you have a lot of time.

1014
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,220
Develop that savings muscle.

1015
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,820
Diversify the moment you have any real capital.

1016
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,900
Start diversifying that way no matter what happens.

1017
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:45,900
You have Kevlar.

1018
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:48,700
You can have a stock go to zero and a bullet hits you in the chest.

1019
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,580
It doesn't kill you because you're diversified.

1020
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:56,660
Then take advantage of the flaw in the species and that's time and recognize that time will

1021
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:58,100
go faster than you think.

1022
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,540
If you're just a little bit of discipline, a little bit of maturity, a little bit of

1023
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,380
that savings muscle early, that the S&P is up 11% a year since 2008.

1024
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,580
Well, that sounds boring.

1025
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:13,740
Now that means every 21 years your investments are up 8x and that 21 years will go really

1026
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,740
fast.

1027
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:16,340
So hope you sell a best selling book.

1028
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,700
Hope your company goes public.

1029
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:22,700
Hope your album goes double platinum or some rich uncle dies and leaves you everything.

1030
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:27,180
But just in case, make sure you're financially secure and I can get you there.

1031
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:32,140
If you follow these principles and show a little bit of discipline, a little bit of maturity

1032
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:34,820
because the good news is I can get you rich.

1033
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,460
The bad news is the answer is slowly.

1034
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:39,260
We can get you there.

1035
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:45,900
So the algebra of wealth equals focus plus stoicism times time times diversification.

1036
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,340
That's the formula.

1037
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:48,340
That's the formula.

1038
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,340
You're the formula guy.

1039
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,220
A lot of your talks, you use formulas to explain stuff.

1040
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:55,500
You've had the algebra of happiness, now the algebra of wealth.

1041
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,020
Is this going to be a whole algebra of blank series?

1042
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,780
Any time I see that, I'm into it.

1043
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,020
If it's an equation, I'm into it.

1044
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:08,060
So humans need constructs to remember things.

1045
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,540
You can read a book and if it doesn't have constructs or visualizations, it's pretty

1046
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,020
easy to forget about it.

1047
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,340
So I really like constructs, equations.

1048
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:20,340
I read the algebra of happiness, algebra of wealth out today and I'm about to sign a three

1049
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,340
book deal.

1050
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,940
I'm writing the algebra of masculinity, the algebra of work, and the algebra of mating.

1051
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,300
Those are three topics I'm super interested in and I want to try and do enough research

1052
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,740
where I can distill it down to some best practices that people can hold on to.

1053
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,380
Well, I want to talk about the first variable in this.

1054
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,500
You said focus, because we talked about socialism.

1055
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,500
I know about time.

1056
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,780
I know about diversification, but teach me about focus.

1057
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,900
I'm pretty bad at focus, trying to get better.

1058
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:49,700
Give me a couple words on focus as part of this equation.

1059
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:54,300
If you have a side hustle, you need to find a different main hustle.

1060
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:59,340
You're better off with the time you spent on a side hustle, investing that incremental

1061
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,820
effort in your main hustle.

1062
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,340
If you constantly find it, a side hustle is fine if you're investigating a new main

1063
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,860
hustle, but the way you get wealthy is not a variety of things.

1064
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,740
It's being really great at one thing.

1065
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,580
So that's the focus and the term we use is mastery or ninja like capability, but try

1066
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:22,140
and find something you could become great at and that's not easy.

1067
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:26,340
But also, again, we talked about this before, finding an industry that's not very sexy because

1068
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:35,700
if you're in the top 10% of tax law or of installing HVAC or energy efficient HVAC,

1069
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:41,220
or you're in the top 10% of people who know how to install soapstone kitchen counters,

1070
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,860
you're going to make a really good living.

1071
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:47,700
Taking care of your kids is just so much fun.

1072
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:53,100
Being able to be there for your parents is economically, is just really exciting and

1073
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,580
really a lot of fun.

1074
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:58,740
And I think young people mistake passion for their hobbies, not recognizing when they get

1075
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:04,980
older to be able to give money away, to be able to do nice things, to be able to relax

1076
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:07,380
with your partner.

1077
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:08,860
It's just super enjoyable.

1078
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:14,260
It's almost as fun as spinning to, I mean, that shit is fun.

1079
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,940
That is really enjoyable.

1080
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:19,980
And so put yourself in a position when you're a little bit older because it'll go really

1081
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:24,260
fast to just do wonderful things with people you care about.

1082
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:28,940
And the way you get there is by making more than you spend saving, but the first thing

1083
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,740
you got to do is find the focus.

1084
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:33,700
Find something.

1085
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:37,020
We live in a specialist economy.

1086
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,780
Find something like, try and just think, could I be great at this?

1087
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:42,900
Could I be great at this?

1088
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:46,460
That's not the question because if you become great at it, trust me, you'll become passionate

1089
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,460
about it.

1090
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,500
And you can't become great at anything you hate.

1091
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,860
It's just going to be automatically be screened out.

1092
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:54,540
I'm not suggesting drudgery is the way.

1093
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,540
If you find something drudgerous or whatever the term is, you're just not going to be great

1094
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,780
at it.

1095
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,660
But I found consulting.

1096
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:04,980
I never, I didn't know what consulting was when I was in college, even business school.

1097
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:08,780
I figured out, wait, people will pay you to wrench your brain?

1098
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:09,780
Wow.

1099
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:13,260
And I was always really good at establishing these proxy father-son relationships with

1100
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,100
powerful men.

1101
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:20,100
And then basically my core deal with them is, I understand brand better than you.

1102
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,100
You're the CMO.

1103
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,380
I'm going to make you the CEO in three years.

1104
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:25,940
In exchange for that, you're going to pay my company a million dollars a year to answer

1105
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:29,300
very deep, hard questions.

1106
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:32,820
And I figured that out at kind of my late 20s, which was a blessing.

1107
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:35,540
And then when I sold the company, I'm like, I don't want to be in services anymore.

1108
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,660
It's a young person's business.

1109
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,460
I'm sick of being on planes.

1110
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,580
So I had to workshop my life again.

1111
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,260
And then I figured out, okay, I'm a good teacher.

1112
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,260
What does it mean to be a good teacher?

1113
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,780
It means you have to be a good storyteller.

1114
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,980
But what if I story told in different mediums?

1115
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,980
Could I make money in books?

1116
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,380
Could I make money speaking?

1117
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,940
Could I make money in podcasts?

1118
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,700
And I figured out, yeah, I'm good at this.

1119
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,980
I could even be great someday.

1120
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,420
And that mastery has led to a really nice life.

1121
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:05,980
But I've always tried to spend reasonably, spend less than I was making, sometimes more

1122
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:08,060
than others.

1123
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:10,180
I finally learned to diversify the hard way.

1124
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:14,820
I lost everything twice in 2000 and again in 2008, because I thought it was so awesome

1125
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:18,460
that whatever is my focus, this is naturally going to be successful through my sheer force

1126
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,060
of character.

1127
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,420
That's not true.

1128
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:27,700
So I started diversifying and just kind of follow these basic principles and let time

1129
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,220
take over and really started saving a lot of money in my 40s.

1130
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:37,820
I deployed an army of capital to start fighting and killing for me and my family and my sleep.

1131
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:46,660
And that army just grew in a bull market and came home with just immense spoils for me

1132
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:50,380
because I deployed this army early and often and I kept adding to it.

1133
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:52,380
I feel like, here's a tank.

1134
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,380
All right.

1135
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,380
Okay.

1136
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,380
I'm saving money.

1137
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:56,380
I'm not going to have the fat apartment.

1138
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:57,380
All right.

1139
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,380
Okay.

1140
00:59:58,380 --> 00:59:59,380
Here's some more artillery.

1141
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,380
Go kill more people and come home with money.

1142
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:01,900
That's a little bit much.

1143
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,900
Anyways.

1144
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:04,780
We're still working off of that one.

1145
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,780
Yeah.

1146
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,780
Still working through that one.

1147
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:07,820
Wrong choice.

1148
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,820
Wrong choice of words.

1149
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:09,820
Accoutrements.

1150
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,300
The accoutrements of my army.

1151
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,660
Scott, thanks for coming on, man.

1152
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:17,180
And everybody go buy the book, the algebra of wealth.

1153
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:20,500
He has to be number one on the charts because he needs our affirmation and let's give it

1154
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:21,500
to him.

1155
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,500
Thanks, guys.

1156
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:23,500
Thanks for your success.

1157
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:24,500
Thanks, Sam.

1158
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:25,500
Thanks, Sean.

1159
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:26,500
And thanks, Ari.

1160
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,500
Thank you.

1161
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,500
Bye.

1162
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Bye.

1163
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,500
Bye.

1164
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,500
Bye.

1165
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,500
Bye.

1166
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,500
Bye.

1167
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,500
Bye.

1168
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,500
Bye.

1169
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,500
Bye.
