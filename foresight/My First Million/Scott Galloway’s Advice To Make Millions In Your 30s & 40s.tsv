0	2000	My first Nellian.
2000	4000	Let's go.
4000	10000	My first baby mama, my first ketamine experience, my first addiction.
20000	22000	Here's what I want to start with.
22000	24000	I love some of the things that you say.
24000	26000	And one of the things you said is,
26000	28000	don't follow your passion.
28000	31000	People who are already rich tell you to follow your passion.
31000	33000	You should follow your talent.
33000	35000	Can you unpack that? Can you explain what you mean?
35000	37000	I wanted to be an athlete.
37000	38000	That was my passion.
38000	40000	And then I'm going to UCLA as a blessing,
40000	44000	because I figured out pretty quickly that I wasn't in the 0.1% you need to be
44000	46000	and to make your living as an athlete.
46000	50000	And there's a fair, there's some pretty basic axioms
50000	54000	that should guide your career choices around where you invest your most,
54000	56000	precious capital, and that is your time, your human capital.
56000	60000	The first is the sexier the business, the lower return on investment.
60000	67000	You want to be in fashion, the arts, movies, modeling, sports.
67000	73000	Unless you get really incandescent green lights from a very early age,
73000	75000	so you're going to be in the 0.1%,
75000	79000	try and make a living somewhere else and then do that on the weekends.
79000	86000	And that is if you, the SAG-AFTRA, the most talented actors in the world,
86000	88000	it's hard to get a SAG-AFTRA union card.
88000	89000	You have to actually ban something.
89000	93000	These are the most talented actors in the world, 182,000 of them.
93000	96000	87% of them don't qualify for health insurance
96000	99000	because they don't make more than $23,000 in a given year.
99000	104000	So the key is finding, not finding your passion, but finding your talent
104000	106000	and then committing to developing mastery.
106000	110000	And if you can develop mastery in anything that has a 90% plus employment rate,
110000	115000	which 98% of sectors enjoy, the economic accoutrements, the camaraderie,
115000	119000	the prestige, the relevance, just the sheer joy of mastery
119000	122000	will make you passionate about whatever it is.
122000	126000	And I'm passionate about taking care of my kids.
126000	129000	I'm passionate about being able to step in and help my aging father.
129000	134000	I'm passionate about, I'd rather be Raphael Nadal or Federer,
134000	139000	but I'd rather be me than the number three or number four tennis player in the world
139000	143000	because I have financial security, I get to go to Wimbledon on my own terms
143000	147000	and not be as nervous and not throw up or before a match.
147000	152000	So yeah, I'd rather be Nadal, but pretty much anyone else playing tennis, I'd rather be.
152000	154000	And I got there with boring companies.
154000	160000	So the less sexy a business, the higher the return on investment.
160000	165000	So I would suggest that we stop, you know, think about, well, what could I be good at?
165000	169000	I think that's what your 20s are for, workshopping stuff and also getting it wrong.
169000	171000	I started in investment banking and I was terrible at it.
171000	173000	I didn't like them, they didn't like me.
173000	176000	And I had to go back to business school and just start workshopping.
176000	178000	Where could I be great?
178000	180000	What industry could I be great in?
180000	186000	So don't, you know, find what you're good at and then get great at it
186000	188000	and then be a DJ on the weekends.
188000	191000	By the way, congratulations today.
191000	193000	Today's the release date of the book, right?
193000	194000	Algebra of wealth.
194000	196000	Today is the day.
196000	197000	So that's, that's going to be huge.
197000	201000	I mean, I read the algebra of happiness a while ago and I've been watching the videos forever.
201000	206000	And so I kind of, I didn't get an early copy of the book, but I will buy it and read it.
206000	207000	And so you'll get my $23.
207000	210000	I need you to, by the way, we're number one on Amazon today.
210000	212000	I just thought I would drop that because I'm desperate.
212000	214000	I'm desperate for your affirmation, Sam.
214000	215000	That's all right. I'll give it to you.
215000	216000	I'll give it to you.
216000	217000	I won't starve you from that.
217000	218000	You've got it.
218000	219000	I look up to you.
219000	220000	I think you're the man.
220000	221000	Thank you.
221000	223000	Well, let me ask you about the number one on Amazon real quick.
223000	225000	You, you're a pretty stoic guy.
225000	230000	In fact, when you come on the pod, it's always surprising to me that you are so even keel,
230000	232000	but it's the launch day of your book.
232000	234000	You worked on this thing really hard.
234000	238000	Your number one on Amazon, what, how does Scott Galloway celebrate?
238000	240000	Oh, you know, I'm not, I'm pretty flat.
240000	243000	I don't, I congratulate the team.
243000	244000	It feels great.
244000	245000	It's very gratifying.
246000	247000	I love benchmarks.
247000	248000	I'm addicted to me.
248000	249000	Everyone's addicted to something.
249000	253000	I'm addicted to strangers affirmation, which is kind of pathetic at my age.
253000	258000	And that's a form of affirmation, but it's very rewarding because so many people work
258000	263000	so goddamn hard on this thing, just not me, but, you know, my research is my analyst,
263000	268000	my PR people, my social people, my publisher, my book agent, you know, greatness is in the
268000	269000	agency of others.
269000	270000	So it's just very gratifying.
270000	275000	And plus my podcast co-hosts got to number three on the best sellers list.
275000	280000	So goddamn it, if I'm not going to get to number two, I must beat Kara Swisher.
280000	285000	So, Sam, if you could go buy several thousand books, I'd appreciate it.
285000	288000	And if you like it, write a review.
288000	291000	And if you hate it, please buy more and send them to an enemy.
291000	295000	But yeah, I'm addicted to external affirmation.
295000	296000	It's really pathetic.
296000	302000	Well, so, I mean, the book, from my understanding, is that it's basically talks about the people
302000	305000	who have money and the people who don't, and what are the commonalities between the winners
305000	306000	and the losers.
306000	309000	And you have, I've read this for years.
309000	314000	There was this awesome fast company article about you, and I've seen you say this in videos
314000	318000	where you were shockingly calculating when starting your last company, L2.
318000	321000	I think you said something like Deloitte did a study.
321000	324000	They did a study that shows what's the difference between the people who sell their companies
324000	328000	for five to ten times revenue versus those who just sell it for one or two times.
328000	333000	And you had these like four or five things, and it was, they own a niche, they have recurring revenue,
333000	339000	tech is at their core, and that they're international, and then finally they have defensive IP.
339000	343000	And then you went on and said how like in your 40s, when you were starting L2, 40s and 50s,
343000	345000	you were like only focused on money.
345000	348000	You said, I worked my ass off, I was there at the office at 2 a.m.
348000	350000	You said, but I don't regret it.
350000	351000	You said it was totally worth it.
351000	355000	And when you were starting L2, I don't really know too much about that industry or that business
355000	357000	other than a handful of articles.
357000	361000	Were you that calculating with working backwards from an exit?
361000	365000	And by the way, the story ends with you selling it for $120 million.
365000	368000	160, boss. Jesus, get your facts right.
368000	370000	And by the way, I'm number one on Amazon today.
370000	372000	I don't know if I told you that.
375000	380000	Yeah, I didn't have a lot of money, and for me, work was about getting economic security.
380000	382000	I was very focused on money.
382000	385000	And I'm not saying that's the right way, it was just my way.
385000	390000	And I had done a lot of analysis in this study referring to said, okay,
390000	395000	there are companies that sell in any industry, the lowest 10 percentile,
395000	399000	the upper-desile of the valuations they get taken out at.
399000	404000	And this study looked at the common features of the companies that got sold in the top-desile.
404000	406000	And it was all the things you talked about.
406000	408000	And that's literally how I shaped the business model.
408000	410000	I went to the London office right away.
410000	414000	I said, charging consulting fees, I said, pay me a quarter of a million bucks a year,
414000	417000	and I'll answer your toughest questions using data.
417000	420000	We focused on luxury and then consumer brands.
420000	422000	We broadened our niche a little bit.
422000	427000	We spent, I raised $17 million to create a series of technology and scraping tools
427000	430000	so that I could collect more data points than anyone in the world,
430000	437000	such that when the inevitable guy from the analytics department came in with his arms crossed to play, gotcha,
437000	439000	they just couldn't argue with our data.
439000	442000	We just collected more data than anyone in the world on these issues
442000	444000	and tried to distill it down to something actionable.
444000	447000	So I was very focused on exit.
447000	450000	And we sold for eight times revenue.
450000	456000	So yeah, man, my basic pitch to people was, you're going to work your ass off
456000	460000	and I'm going to try and get you to, you know,
460000	464000	I'm going to try and get you to where your parents were 20 years earlier.
464000	467000	And if you're looking for balance, this isn't that place.
467000	470000	If you're really into management or other things, tell me,
470000	475000	and I will try and shape a role around what's important to you.
475000	481000	But we are a small business going all in to try and create economic security for us and our families.
481000	484000	With Prop Team Media, we're about 14 people now.
484000	486000	I purposely didn't take outside capital.
486000	489000	I'm not on that hamster wheel again.
489000	491000	I'm not trying to, Jones for an exit,
491000	494000	I'm trying to build something interesting that has relevance,
494000	497000	that has a little bit more impact on the social issues we think about
497000	499000	and also pair people really well.
499000	501000	I used to pay people below market and give them equity
501000	504000	and I was throwing nickels around like there are manhole covers
504000	506000	because I wanted to have a profitable company I could sell.
506000	508000	Now my priorities have changed.
508000	511000	And the people who joined the company, I tell them,
511000	513000	this isn't the kind of company that gets sold.
513000	519000	But what I'll do is I'll share, I'll give you equity or participation in my book deals.
519000	525000	You are a junior analyst, you get one or two percent of any book deal I get.
525000	528000	Try and create some economic upside for them.
528000	532000	My natural starting point is that people come to work
532000	534000	to develop economic security for them and their families,
534000	538000	to increase their currency, their currency and the marketplace experience
538000	541000	and also to develop relationships.
541000	546000	The workplace is a great place to meet friends, mentors, additional co-founders.
547000	551000	And we spend a lot of money on, we saved, with COVID we gave up our office,
551000	554000	we save about $800,000 or $900,000 a year on an office
554000	559000	because of course as a narcissist I had to have this amazing office in Soho, which was stupid.
559000	563000	And I have this rule at work, or not this rule, but this benefit.
563000	566000	If any four of them are together, they get my credit card.
566000	568000	They can go to Broadway or they can go to Tulum.
568000	571000	And they've done those things without asking my permission.
571000	574000	As long as there's four of them, they got my credit card.
574000	576000	And the number one source of retention,
576000	580000	I think the key to building a small business is retention because if you find good people,
580000	584000	you just don't want them to be with you a year or two years and go to Google
584000	586000	because the switching costs are enormous.
586000	590000	And if you find someone good, your job as an entrepreneur or the CEO
590000	592000	is just to create an environment where they want to stick.
592000	595000	Retention of employees, in my opinion, is just huge.
595000	598000	And I find, or I read a study, another study on this,
598000	602000	and it said the number one source of retention or the number one lever for retention,
602000	605000	people think it's compensation, people think it's culture.
605000	608000	It's whether or not that person has a friend at work.
608000	612000	If they have a friend at work, they look forward to going to work
612000	614000	and they are less likely to leave.
614000	618000	And so what I try and do, everybody interviews everybody when we hire people,
618000	620000	but these kids, it's really inspiring.
620000	624000	They'll go, like six of them will go on vacation together.
624000	626000	They'll say, oh, Scott, you're speaking in Hamburg, Germany.
626000	628000	All six of us are going to come.
628000	630000	And they have a great time together.
630000	631000	They're like each other.
631000	635000	And it's really, it's a powerful kind of business weapon, if you will.
635000	641000	Now, I don't think you can do that when it's a company scales beyond 50, 100 people.
641000	644000	But I found for a small business, it's really powerful.
644000	647000	Hey, real quick, as you know, we're big on ideas here.
647000	651000	We love bringing new ideas, business ideas, brainstorming ideas for the podcast.
651000	653000	Well, a lot of people ask, what do you do with all those ideas?
653000	654000	Can we go find them?
654000	655000	Is there a list somewhere?
655000	658000	The great people at HubSpot have put together a business ideas database.
658000	659000	It's totally free.

663000	668000	over 50 plus business ideas that are from the archive listed out for you curated.

669000	670000	Go download it.
670000	671000	It's free.
671000	672000	Check it out.
672000	673000	It's in the description below.
673000	674000	All right.
674000	675000	Back to the show.
675000	676000	And is the trick there that you don't try to be their friend?
676000	677000	Because I've had that problem before.
677000	681000	I wanted to be the friend and that made the management a little bit messy.
681000	685000	And I realized it is much better for me to not be the friend and not be included in the
685000	686000	hangs.
686000	688000	The whole company functions better.
688000	692000	Even personally, I was like, oh man, they're all going out without me.
692000	695000	But actually it was far better that it went that way.
695000	700000	I always had a healthy sense of what the border was.
700000	707000	Me and my president and my committee and the partner at L2, we're both about the same age
707000	709000	and we have the same view.
709000	711000	We have parties all the time.
711000	713000	We show up early.
713000	716000	As soon as shit starts getting a little like crazy, we leave.
716000	717000	Yeah.
717000	721000	A, we don't need to see them drunk.
721000	724000	They definitely don't need to see me drunk.
724000	730000	And my attitude is what you're saying, Sean, is really interesting.
730000	734000	And that is I'm just coming to the realization as a dad.
734000	735000	I'm not their friend.
735000	737000	I'm their dad.
737000	741000	Because it was really upsetting to me that my kids did kind of, I don't want to say I
741000	744000	don't want to be my friend, but I just naturally assumed that my kids would adore me and be
744000	747000	really into World War II history and CrossFit because that's what dad is into.
747000	748000	And guess what?
748000	749000	They're not.
749000	752000	And what I realized is I'm not their friend.
752000	754000	I'm there to be their dad.
754000	758000	And it's kind of the same way I think I work with such young people.
758000	762000	I think the average age is probably 30 or 34 because I'm there.
762000	765000	But the median is like 25.
765000	770000	It's basically a bunch of kids, overeducated, super ambitious kids.
770000	772000	And it's easy.
772000	773000	They're doing dinner and drink somewhere.
773000	774000	I show up for dinner.
774000	776000	I leave before dessert.
776000	780000	And then they can, you know, they can enjoy each other without thinking they're being judged
780000	782000	by Scott.
782000	789000	So yeah, I don't, I don't, I don't, I draw sharp relief between, you know, work and
789000	790000	fun with those guys.
790000	791000	I love it.
791000	794000	I go out with them, but I go out for the first couple hours and then I disappear so they
794000	796000	can, they can have their own son.
796000	799000	I love the four of you together.
799000	800000	You get my card.
800000	801000	That's amazing little tidbit.
801000	805000	I'm, I'm here to collect little lessons learned from you today.
805000	807000	And that's, that's one immediate one for me.
807000	808000	Thanks mom.
808000	812000	So like, obviously you're kind of, you're, I don't, I don't know if you're at the peak,
812000	816000	but you're, you're at, you're killing it right now in terms of your pod and kind of
816000	818000	being a public figure in the books and everything.
818000	820000	And then before that you had the company.
820000	822000	So you had a huge financial outcome.
822000	826000	One of the things that I think it's kind of brushed over in your history is what you
826000	828000	were doing with kind of being an activist investor.
828000	832000	I know you were on the board of New York times and you made a few other like pretty like
832000	833000	substantial investments.
833000	836000	I know you were working with a hedge fund to do that.
836000	838000	What were some of the deals that you were doing?
838000	840000	What were some of the kind of the best deals?
840000	841000	What were some of the worst deals?
841000	845000	What were some of the signals that you had where you were like, this is an interesting
845000	846000	deal.
846000	847000	I should pounce on this.
847000	848000	Sure.
848000	849000	So there's a bit of a backstory there.
849000	851000	I started coming to go rent envelope and went public.
851000	852000	I was on the board.
852000	857000	I got into a fight with arguably the most successful venture capitalist in the world.
857000	858000	Spoiler alert.
858000	859000	He won the fight.
859000	860000	I was kicked off the board.
860000	864000	So I was kicked out of the band that I started, which was like emotionally and mentally very
864000	865000	taxing for me.
865000	867000	And then I got angry.
867000	869000	I was a really weird time in my life.
869000	871000	My mom was dying and I moved in with her.
871000	875000	And during the day I would take manager health care at night.
875000	876000	She was living in Vegas.
876000	883000	I'd go to downtown and get shitty drunk with strippers and quote unquote friends and then
883000	887000	go back and manage my mom's health care and watch everyone loves Raymond and Jeopardy with
887000	888000	my mom.
888000	889000	It was a strange time in my life.
889000	893660	I was also very angry because I'd just been kicked off the board of rent envelope.
893660	897320	So I took a half a million dollars in my money and I filed a proxy to replace the entire
897320	899080	board.
899080	902680	And I learned everything about activist investing and shareholder governance.
902680	906000	And I tried to kick everyone off the board.
906000	910880	And I own 10% of the company and I think I got 12% of the vote and my proxy solicitor
910880	912680	said that 2% was probably a mistake.
912680	916680	So basically no one voted for my slate and that was kind of a low moment for me.
916680	917680	Okay.
917680	923480	The world has told me they don't want me involved in this corporation or in public companies.
923480	928800	And then six months later, I got a call from a hedge fund that said, you're crazy, but you
928800	929840	are kind of crazy.
929840	935560	We have some stakes in companies and we need someone to kind of go in and rattle the cage.
935560	941040	And it just struck me that at your lowest moment, you really don't know where that might lead.
941040	943360	And I got backed.
943360	947360	I went into a company called, I bought 10% of a company called United Retail, which was
947360	948560	a plus size clothing brand.
948560	951960	I basically showed up and said, let me build your website.
951960	952960	You don't have a website.
952960	955720	This was a while ago where I'm going to try and replace the board.
955720	957200	This had fine.
957200	960560	Stock went from two to eight and I'm like, wow, this is easy.
960560	964520	And I did it at Sharper Image, bought a big stake there, went in there.
964520	966240	The company seemed like a mess.
966240	967240	Stock had gone up a little bit.
967240	968240	I got out.
968240	969240	I did it at Gateway Computer.
969240	970240	Went on the board there.
970240	971240	That was more difficult.
971240	974520	We made a small amount of money, but I'd never lost money doing it.
974520	977720	So then I went and raised $700 million and became the largest shareholder in the New
977720	980640	York Times and went on the board there.
980640	981640	And timing is everything.
981640	986040	And in this case, I went on the board in March of 2008.
986040	989520	And the stock went from 16 to three in about five months.
989520	994640	At one point, I think I was losing $10 or $12 million of other people's money every day.
994640	996160	And we almost lost the business.
996160	997160	The company almost went bankrupt.
997160	1002480	I don't know if you guys remember that, but in the world of media, people just stopped
1002480	1003480	advertising.
1003480	1004480	They just stopped.
1004480	1007840	It was like our tap of revenue just got turned off.
1007840	1011080	And it was sort of the great financial recession.
1011080	1015400	It kind of ended my career as an activism because one, I don't think I was very good
1015400	1016400	at it.
1016400	1021000	And two, I was getting to a stage in my life where I just didn't want to be combative anymore.
1021000	1023040	I didn't want to go to war with CEOs.
1023040	1027360	I was just exhausted by being an antagonist.
1027360	1031720	I thought, I'm never going to go on a board again unless the CEO wants me there.
1031720	1032720	But I did that for a while.
1032720	1033720	I learned a lot.
1033720	1039240	I made a little bit of money, but I was in my early 40s and quite frankly, just trying
1039240	1043000	to figure out a way to make a living so I could stay in New York, which isn't easy.
1043000	1048800	And I think I was flailing a little bit, but it was a great experience.
1048800	1053200	I learned a lot about human nature, about shareholders, about governance.
1053200	1056320	I get called a lot by boards when they're being challenged by an activist because I
1056320	1057320	was one.
1057320	1060200	And I think I have some insight into how these people think.
1060200	1067040	But yeah, it was just a strange time in my life, but it was interesting.
1067040	1068040	It was fun.
1068040	1069640	I just wasn't very good at it.
1069640	1070640	Yeah, that's cool.
1070640	1073960	I had a bunch of different careers and I like that.
1073960	1074960	I like variety.
1074960	1078320	I like people who have different chapters and sagas of their life.
1078320	1082080	And you mentioned your 20s are for figuring out what you actually like to do or what you're
1082080	1085160	actually good at or the intersection between those two.
1085160	1091840	It sounds like yours went past your 20s and you just kept experimenting along the way.
1091840	1094720	Is that a fair assessment for you?
1094720	1097240	Yeah, investment banking, no good at it.
1097240	1102960	Human School started a brand strategy firm called Profit, grew it to a couple hundred
1102960	1105400	people, sold it for $33 million.
1105400	1106400	What do I want to do?
1106400	1108640	I know I want to teach.
1108640	1115200	The .com implosion took me from what I thought was being wealthy to not being wealthy.
1115200	1119520	Teaching wasn't going to help me maintain the lifestyle I needed or wanted to maintain
1119520	1124360	with two young kids in New York, so I needed to find other ways to make money.
1124360	1129640	I did the hedge fund thing for a while, did boards, and then saw an opportunity in analytics
1129640	1135720	and benchmarking and started that company, I think O9 or O10, and that was my big win.
1135720	1137120	And the timing is everything.
1137120	1140720	I got swept up into what is the greatest bull market economy in history.
1140720	1145800	08 to present is probably going to go down as the greatest extended bull market run
1145800	1147440	in history.
1147440	1152480	People don't understand just what an anomaly the last 16 years have been relative to the
1152480	1154560	history of the market.
1154560	1162320	And just as I was coming into my prime income earning years, the wins just filled up my sales.
1162320	1167240	And I finally got all the moons sort of lined up, if you will.
1167240	1174520	But I've always said, you got to be humble when things work because a lot of your success
1174520	1176040	isn't your fault.
1176040	1181400	At the same time, I wish I had been more forgiving of myself when things didn't work
1181400	1183820	because I have trouble forgiving myself.
1183820	1189000	I struggle with anger, and the person I get most angry at is myself, and I have trouble
1189000	1192000	getting past shit.
1192000	1195480	I was at a book thing last night, and I said something, and it just came out wrong, and
1195480	1198640	I'm sitting in bed, and I can't get past that one thing.
1198640	1201240	It went really well, but I can't think that way.
1201240	1204320	I focus on what's wrong.
1204320	1208400	And that would be my advice to people is be humble when you have wins because a lot of
1208400	1214200	it isn't you, but also forgive yourself because, again, a lot of it isn't you.
1214200	1219120	My roommate in college had the poem If by I think Richard Kipling on his wall, and one
1219120	1224680	of the great lines of that poem is, if you can meet triumph and disaster and treat those
1224680	1228320	two imposters just the same, and that's always stuck with me.
1228320	1229920	That's kind of what you're talking about.
1229920	1235360	Your greatest triumphs, maintaining the humility, and then in your greatest failures, not beating
1235360	1237560	yourself up too much.
1237560	1242560	You're a big proponent of stoicism, and that seems like a pretty stoic way to be.
1242560	1246480	Give us the like, there's a lot of people listening to this right now that may be familiar
1246480	1251040	with stoicism, don't practice, don't kind of know how it applies to their life.
1251040	1252040	Make your pitch.
1252040	1254880	Why stoicism matters to somebody?
1254880	1259960	Well, just your own mental and emotional health, and Ryan Holiday is kind of my Yoda
1259960	1262320	on stoicism, and he distills it this way.
1262320	1264240	Life is not about what happens to you.
1264240	1269320	You can't control that, but you can't control how you respond to what happens to you.
1269320	1277320	And I've tried to always remember that, and I have trouble practicing it, but the ultimate
1277320	1282720	stoicism piece of art in modern history or modern media is Brokeback Mountain.
1282720	1285680	If you can't fix it, you've got to stand it.
1285680	1291080	And that is try and focus on the things you can control, and you can control your emotions.
1291080	1294440	It's very difficult to control what happens to you.
1294440	1302280	And just also recognize, and this is more atheism than stoicism, everyone on this podcast,
1302280	1306560	everyone we know, everyone we care about, what they think of us, they're going to be
1306560	1309600	dead in a hundred years.
1309600	1316120	In a blink of the history, nothing you say or do or what anyone else thinks of you is
1316120	1320880	going to matter for very long, and something that really has helped me when I was embarrassed
1320880	1325440	or I thought I didn't equip myself very well is what you realize is just imagine yourself
1325440	1330920	when someone says or does something stupid, you think to yourself, oh, that was stupid.
1330920	1334280	And then you go back to thinking about yourself.
1334280	1339520	And people aren't thinking about you, your wealth, your failures, your successes as much
1339520	1341040	as you are.
1341040	1344600	And so the key is just trying to be comfortable with yourself and comfortable in your own
1344600	1345600	skin.
1345600	1350320	And not only that, really kind of focus on what your spouse thinks of you.
1350360	1351360	Is your spouse happy?
1351360	1354160	Do you have a good relationship with your kids?
1354160	1356280	Because what Twitter thinks of you really isn't that important.
1356280	1362400	And because I had so much trouble actually footing my emotions to that logical notion,
1362400	1366760	I know it doesn't matter what people on Twitter or the Twitter mob think of me, but I couldn't
1366760	1369040	emotionally separate myself from it.
1369040	1371160	I don't have those skills.
1371160	1373400	So a role model of mine is again, Sam Harris.
1373400	1375000	He's like, oh, I got off Twitter.
1375000	1376000	I can't handle that.
1376000	1379520	He's like, why don't you get off of Twitter and I'm like, yeah, I can.
1379560	1383320	So I stopped, I'm off of Twitter for the last nine months and it's been one of the most
1383320	1386120	accretive things to my mental health.
1386120	1389080	And I didn't like to admit this, but I would say five or six weekends where I just got
1389080	1392680	really bummed out by something, probably two or three of them started on Twitter.
1392680	1400480	I thought, why am I on something that's making me on a regular basis upset?
1400480	1402720	And there's an addictive nature to it.
1402720	1404760	I think it must be just, and that's what freaks me out.
1404760	1406280	I can modulate it.
1406280	1408840	You know, can my 13 year old son?
1409160	1412960	Do I even know that he's upset when he goes, we have a rule in my house that our boys
1412960	1415360	aren't allowed to go into their rooms or their phones alone?
1415360	1419960	Because I think this thing can literally take a teenager, especially a teenager girl, down
1419960	1424760	a rabbit hole and kind of zero to 60 really fast and then start serving her content.
1424760	1427240	Oh, you're worried about dieting?
1427240	1431960	Well, here's extreme dieting tips, despite the fact we know you're 5'10", 95 pounds.
1431960	1433440	Oh, you're depressed?
1433440	1436280	Well, here are some videos of people considering suicide.
1436280	1438800	We're going to normalize it for you.
1438800	1443440	And I don't think parents are really in touch with just how ugly and how fast it gets really
1443440	1444440	ugly.
1444440	1451480	So, you know, I'm trying to be very thoughtful about what it is as a stoicism, controlling
1451480	1457000	what I can't control, and then trying to be in better touch with my emotions and recognize
1457000	1463040	that when you're down, it's more about the chemistry in your head than any legitimate
1463040	1464440	reason to be down.
1465440	1468200	You're going to look at the end of life, the biggest regrets.
1468200	1471960	My colleague at NYU, Adam Alter, did great research on people who are very near death
1471960	1474080	and palliative care.
1474080	1477560	And their biggest regrets are one, they'd wish they'd stayed in better touch with friends.
1477560	1481440	They wish they'd lived the life they wanted to lead, not the life society or their parents
1481440	1483360	wanted them to lead.
1483360	1487760	Their biggest regret is they wish they'd been less hard on themselves.
1487760	1489040	They wish they'd forgiven themselves.
1489040	1493200	They wish they'd allowed themselves to be happy.
1493200	1495880	And that's kind of been, that's something I've been very focused on.
1495880	1499120	It's like, okay, stop beating yourself up, you're going to be dead soon.
1499120	1505800	Why wouldn't you squeeze as much juice out of this lemon as conceivable and like afford
1505800	1510080	yourself the opportunity to be happy and be sad if you need to be.
1510080	1513880	But I think of stoicism as, again, life isn't about what happens to you, it's how you respond
1513880	1519600	to what happens to you and decide what is in your control and, you know, try and be
1519600	1522840	good to yourself, try and forgive yourself and also just try and be humble.
1522840	1528400	You are never more prone to a really big mistake than right after a big win.
1528400	1533060	Because here's the thing, you start thinking you're good at picking stocks.
1533060	1536920	You start thinking you're so skilled at work, it wasn't that someone senior to you took
1536920	1539200	an interest in you and championed you.
1539200	1540920	You start thinking, oh, I'm great at real estate.
1540920	1545080	I just didn't get lucky and buy a home at the right time.
1545080	1551600	So be, try and just try and ignore the market when the market tells you you're a failure.
1551600	1552600	And this is personal, too.
1552600	1556160	You know, there's been moments in my life where I thought, I don't think I'm ever going
1556160	1557560	to be able to work again.
1557560	1560600	I think I've ruined everything.
1560600	1563080	I don't think I'm ever going to make a very good living.
1563080	1567880	I remember thinking, saying to my partner at the time, let's move to a low-cost neighborhood,
1567880	1569720	a Charlottesville or a Raleigh Derm.
1569720	1573800	I'm going to teach, try and write, you know, make decent livings and just have a really
1573800	1574800	nice life.
1574800	1576320	And my partner's like, that's giving up.
1576320	1579360	I'm like, well, it's not giving up, but I thought this is it.
1579360	1582000	I just need to substantially downgrade my expectations.
1582000	1585600	And I don't mean to say that that's not a great life.
1585600	1590520	I remember thinking after my divorce, like, I don't think I'm ever going to have someone
1590520	1592360	who I can share my life with again.
1592360	1594960	I'm like, this just is never going to happen to me.
1594960	1599920	I'm an unattractive, broken man who's never going to find like a partner again.
1599920	1602920	I believe that for a short time.
1602920	1608640	And I think that it's important that everybody recognize that, you know, you are the answer
1608640	1610520	to a firm's problem.
1610520	1614800	You can find someone who you can love and is going to love you a great deal.
1614800	1619360	The key is getting up, putting in yourself in a place of success, getting out of the
1619360	1626480	house, being friendly, being risk aggressive, surrounding yourself with people and exercise
1626480	1631320	and nutrition that makes you feel good about yourself, such that when the winds kick up
1631320	1633200	again, your sales are up.
1633200	1635240	And I've always tried to do that.
1635240	1640040	I've had a lot of failure, but I was always had my sales up, such that when the winds
1640040	1645480	kicked up again, I was in a position to rumble, so to speak, because I know a lot of people
1645480	1651240	who are very successful and then they hit some failure, a personal failure, a death of a parent
1651240	1657520	they can't quite get over, a divorce, a company that fails, and they get stuck.
1657520	1659880	They can't forgive themselves.
1659880	1661040	They can't forgive others.
1661040	1664120	They can't forgive the market.
1664120	1670320	Or they lose their mojo, whatever it is, and two, three, five years, seven years goes
1670320	1673360	on and they just haven't progressed.
1673360	1675160	And they start, their skills start atrophying.
1675160	1677680	Their confidence starts atrophying.
1677680	1679520	So what I say is put a statute of limit.
1679520	1683520	Whenever anything bad happens to you, you got to put a statute of limitations on it.
1683520	1688920	A parent dies, you know, within 12 weeks, you should still be sad and thinking about
1688920	1693000	your parents, but you should be able to, you should be able to function.
1693000	1696520	You know, you go through a real emotional trauma or a breakup, well, how serious was
1696520	1697520	it?
1697520	1698520	How much time?
1698520	1699520	What's the statute of limitations?
1699520	1703480	A business goes out of business, okay, mourn for a little while.
1703480	1704480	What is that?
1704480	1705480	Two months?
1705480	1706480	Three months?
1706480	1710760	But if you are better, if you are back sending out emails, trying to raise money, going out
1710760	1715260	trying to meet new people, whatever it might be within that timeline, you need to reach
1715260	1719020	out for help and get unstuck.
1719020	1725460	Because time goes really fast and your skills atrophy in a sort of a downward spiral.
1725460	1728140	And something I've always been able to do is mourn and move on.
1728140	1731420	Churchill said the key to success is the ability to move through failure without losing your
1731420	1732920	sense of enthusiasm.
1732920	1737900	And I've tried, I've been pretty good at not losing my sense of enthusiasm.
1737900	1741580	You're, you know, you've got brilliant ideas.
1741580	1745940	I think you're a good business person, but you talk about not just following your passion,
1745940	1746940	but your talent.
1746940	1749900	And I think that what you're most talented at is communication.
1749900	1754500	I've seen you speak live, I've seen you, I listened to the pod, I've seen your videos.
1754500	1760300	You do such a good job at picking really sharp words and sharp phrases and just small examples
1760300	1761300	like accoutrement.
1761300	1765180	I've noticed that you love that word and I've never heard anyone use it as much as you.
1765180	1766340	And I'm like, oh, I love that word.
1766340	1768740	The one who uses that word, it's a beautiful word.
1768740	1772020	Or you sign your emails with, uh, uh, life is rich.
1772020	1774460	Like you've, you've got beautiful phrases.
1774460	1777260	I think that, uh, I even, by the way, I even had a chat, GBT, right?
1777260	1781540	Uploaded like 150 of your blogs and I would ask it questions to like help give me like
1781540	1784700	ideas for phrases because you're really good at that.
1784700	1788180	Who do you steal from when it comes to, or who you inspired from when it comes to language?
1788180	1791740	I mean, you seem like someone, if I had to guess, like you're a George Carlin guy, something
1791740	1792740	like that.
1792740	1796780	Who do you steal like some of your delivery from or inspired by for writing because you're
1796780	1797780	really good.
1797780	1801180	And do you have like a, a bank of like, when you see a phrase, you're like, Oh, I'm going
1801180	1803100	to take that phrase and use that somewhere.
1803100	1807580	If you don't have a kitchen cabinet of people that you learn enough about that you can mimic
1807580	1809580	them, you're trying to play a team sport.
1809580	1814220	So, uh, you're on the field alone and I didn't figure that out till I was older.
1814220	1819620	So I absolutely, when I see something inspiring, I breathe maybe one book a year.
1819620	1820620	People think I'm well read.
1820620	1823340	I'm not, but I'll find a book that's really meaningful and I'll try and read it two or
1823340	1826380	three times so I can adopt it into my gray matter.
1826980	1830420	Daniel Kahneman's thinking slow and fast.
1830420	1834420	I've read that book a few times and I know everything about loss aversion theory.
1834420	1837340	I know a lot about the relationship between money and happiness.
1837340	1839900	I read observations of a bite standard by Peter Drucker.
1839900	1842980	I read Sapient several times.
1842980	1849060	I want to like really, really, you know, embed stuff lately I'd write down things in my phone
1849060	1854860	that I just think are fucking hilarious, like jokes, you know, I wrote down something today
1854860	1858060	as a prank when my doctor walks in, I put on gloves.
1858060	1859180	I'm going to try that.
1859180	1860180	I love my doctor.
1860180	1865460	I love the idea of him walking in and me snapping on gloves just to see his reaction.
1865460	1869780	We were talking about Trump today and I saw this great quote that said consequences rarely
1869780	1871080	show up lubed.
1871080	1872580	I love that.
1872580	1878540	Um, I just, whenever I see something that really, I just think, you know, I love going
1878540	1881420	out in the public, except for the fact that the public is there.
1881420	1885780	You see these things every day and I will write them down and incorporate them into
1885780	1891420	my rap and especially great phrases, you know, greatness is in the agency of others.
1891420	1894940	I remember my VC said that I'm like, that just makes so much goddamn sense.
1894940	1898420	I'm going to use that over and over and over.
1898420	1901020	So I have a lot of inspiration.
1901020	1904380	Um, I surround myself with really intelligent young people.
1904380	1908100	I know that's ages, but I think young people have a different frame on things that help
1908100	1909100	me.
1909700	1914300	So, but to not, to not sort of, if you're just reading something and not, you don't
1914300	1916700	take away stuff you're going to remember, you haven't really read it.
1916700	1920620	You haven't really absorbed it, but it's all, all manner of stuff.
1920620	1923580	I think, um, um, you're, you're right.
1923580	1925180	I'm totally inspired by George Carlin.
1925180	1926780	I think he's fantastic on society.
1926780	1930300	I've been inspired by Ricky Treve, so I'm inspired by this comedian named Michelle
1930300	1931300	Wolf.
1931300	1936140	I think she's fantastic, but yeah, I've read a lot about Muhammad Ali.
1936140	1940660	I think he's, you know, be courageous, be poetic, but yeah, absolutely every young
1940660	1944820	person should find a couple of people they find really inspiring and try and learn everything
1944820	1950380	about them and what they said, such that you can kind of turn on your Muhammad Ali.
1950380	1954700	And you know, Madeleine Albright, secretary of state, you know, four foot 10, I find her
1954700	1960340	inspiring around pub policy or so on geopolitics, so I've read a lot about her.
1960340	1963620	Our, you know, our memory is long and our reach is far.
1963620	1964620	I love that.
1964620	1968460	She used to say that about America to its enemies, right?
1968460	1972220	Basically a really eloquent way of saying, don't fuck with us boys.
1972220	1978580	And I just love that this four 10 woman only in America can wield, you know, the most powerful
1978580	1981260	nation in the world in terms of our foreign policy abroad.
1981260	1982580	And I found her and she was an immigrant.
1982580	1985900	I just found her inspiring, so I wanted to learn more about her so I could be her on
1985900	1986900	occasion.
1986900	1989300	Anyways, yeah, build a kitchen cabinet of people.
1989740	1994740	It's got, I got a, my notes app here, it's called funny phrases and I just, I collect
1994740	1995740	these.
1995740	1997820	I'll give you, I'll give you three of my funny phrases on here because they're completely
1997820	1998820	out of context.
1998820	2001940	So you won't get it, but you'll get it because you do sounds like you do this too.
2001940	2005500	When somebody's thick, you could say that they're built like a baguette.
2005500	2006500	I like that.
2006500	2008660	Somebody's got the body of a baguette.
2008660	2011260	Okay, next one.
2011260	2015580	If you want to talk about something that other people are avoiding, you say, look, I'm
2015580	2017860	going to address this like an envelope right now.
2018860	2019660	That's a dad joke.
2021340	2028060	Another one would be for CEOs who have bad, you know, a terrible sense of vision of the
2028060	2029060	future.
2029060	2033340	If this CEO was the shooter at JFK, he would have died of natural causes.
2033340	2036300	I love these little, little isms, little phrases, little sentences.
2036300	2037780	You're going to lose this game.
2037780	2042540	Okay, so he looks like a suicide bomber that's having second thoughts.
2045620	2046500	This is more serious.
2046500	2049500	I absolutely, I absolutely love this one.
2049500	2051340	This is more true life advice.
2051340	2055340	Your goal isn't to get the apology, but to forgive the perceived debt.
2055340	2056500	I love that.
2056500	2057500	I love that.
2059500	2061860	Just think down, this is really bad.
2061860	2063220	Teaching my son about sex ads.
2063220	2066500	So I walked into his room with a banana in a condom and he said, what's the banana for?
2066500	2071060	And I said, I can't get hard on an empty stomach.
2071060	2074300	I literally think that's the funniest fucking.
2074300	2075540	That just hit Sam.
2075540	2077300	I literally just hit Sam.
2077300	2082300	I just think that's so inappropriate and so anyways, sorry guys.
2082300	2085700	All right, I'm not going to, this is like getting into a rap battle with Tupac.
2085700	2088180	I'm not, I'm not going to, I'm going to put away my swipe file right here, even though
2088180	2089180	I just had a good one.
2089180	2090180	There you go.
2090180	2091180	I'm going to give up.
2091180	2092180	You win.
2092180	2094260	What are you excited about right now?
2094260	2098900	Like what are some things that are going on in the world or products or ideas or trends?
2098900	2102620	Like, you know, I think you talk a lot about like, you know, stuff that's wrong with America,
2102620	2105420	with the world, culture, with society, but I want to know the opposite.
2105420	2106940	What are you, what are you pumped about?
2106940	2107940	That's not easier for me.
2107940	2111100	I mean, to be blunt, I'm a glass half empty kind of guy.
2111100	2113260	I think a lot about loneliness.
2113260	2114780	I think a lot about struggling young men.
2114780	2117900	I think about the threats of AI.
2117900	2118900	What am I excited about?
2118900	2122780	I have a work with a really talented group of people that are really inspiring.
2122780	2124700	I love the work we're doing.
2124700	2127260	I mean, I just really enjoy it.
2127260	2129100	I get to travel a lot with my kids.
2129100	2134660	I got kids that are at a great age and I get to do a ton of fun stuff with them.
2134660	2136980	It's really intoxicating.
2136980	2142060	You know, I'm just, I get to have a really nice life at this point and I'm just enjoying
2142060	2148860	it with a partner, just really leaning into my kids, you know, just the hallmark shit.
2148860	2155620	I'm just really having a nice time with the people closest to me and I'm healthy.
2155620	2160420	I got good, healthy kids, you know, the boring stuff, man.
2160420	2164620	It's not anything kind of, I mean, I'm going, I'm on my book tour.
2164620	2169020	This week I go to LA for Bill Maher and then I'm meeting a bunch of college buddies and
2169020	2173380	I'm going to stagecoach and then I go to Miami for a bunch of speaking gigs and then I go
2173380	2174380	home to London.
2174380	2179220	I mean, I just have a, I have a really nice life right now and everyone I care about is
2179220	2180840	healthy.
2180840	2182100	I feel relevant.
2182100	2186180	So I just have such a wonderful life and I'm trying to slow time down so I can really
2186180	2191780	appreciate it because, you know, there's no getting around it.
2191780	2198460	I had lunch with Ted Sarandos, which I realized is a name drop, but I'm desperate for your
2198460	2203660	guys' affirmation, but his wife wrote a book on grief and there's this great line, she
2203660	2209980	has this great line and that is grief is love's receipts and I just love that.
2209980	2213700	I just, if you really care about, I didn't have a lot of grief until the age of 40 and
2213700	2216340	I realized it was because there was no one in my life that I really loved or really loved
2216340	2218900	me other than my mom.
2218900	2223500	And so, you know, what I would bless or wish for anybody is they have a lot of grief in
2223500	2227940	their life because what it means is they have loss and when you have loss, it's because
2227940	2231300	you had something wonderful in your life and you miss it.
2231300	2237660	So I'm just trying to appreciate how just nice things are and really, you know, I don't,
2237660	2241460	you know, I'm not really excited about, you know, the Euro finals in Germany, although
2241460	2245900	I am excited about the European finals in Germany, but I'm just, I'm just enjoying myself.
2245900	2247420	And so, I'm rounding third.
2247420	2249020	I have a really nice life right now.
2249020	2253140	I'm just trying to enjoy it because I know everything everywhere ends.
2253140	2256980	What do you say for people who are not rounding third?
2256980	2260660	Like people who are, you know, just batting lead off right now.
2260660	2262760	So you talk a lot to young people.
2262760	2267180	One of the phrases I really liked or one of the quotes I really liked was that opportunity
2267180	2269300	is a function of density.
2269300	2272580	You said, yeah, get to a place that is crowded with success.
2272580	2273580	What do you mean by that?
2273660	2275940	Seems like really good advice for people.
2275940	2280180	Well, and sort of the motivation for the book was, you know, that study that you are kind
2280180	2285420	of the average of your five closest friends, that there's this weird study that peer group,
2285420	2288460	the five people you hang out with, you end up being the same body mass index.
2288460	2291860	You same, end up with similar political values, same jobs, same neighborhood.
2291860	2295340	It means it's weird, you become the same person.
2295340	2298900	What's different though with this greater variance is that of those five people, even
2298900	2303140	though they make kind of similar incomes, one will end up poor, three will be okay and
2303140	2304460	one will end up quite wealthy.
2304460	2309220	And I tried to understand the behaviors that are different and the strategies between the
2309220	2316180	person that ends up financially secure and the others that are less financially secure.
2316180	2319580	And there's some general best practices around youth.
2319580	2321380	You absolutely want to get to a city.
2321380	2324460	If you're ambitious, I'm not suggesting this is the right way.
2324460	2325460	It's just my way.
2325460	2328700	If you're ambitious and you want to have influencer economic security, before you collect
2328700	2330260	dogs and kids, you got to get to a city.
2330260	2334260	Two thirds of economic growth is going to happen in just 20 cities.
2334260	2338540	And so if you're really ambitious and get to the biggest city in your nation, then get
2338540	2342300	to London if you're in Europe or New York in the U.S. or if you're in Texas, San Francisco
2342300	2346620	because those cities are really competitive and you're going to be playing, you know how
2346620	2352020	when you play tennis against players better than you, your game elevates.
2352020	2355380	When you're in a big city, you're playing against the best players in the world.
2355380	2357380	It's hard to live in Brooklyn.
2357380	2361300	It's expensive, which means you got to be really good at what you do and you're surrounded
2361300	2365820	by people who are going to inspire you and who are really will elevate your game.
2365820	2369220	And at some point you'll probably have to move out of the city because it's difficult
2369220	2370220	with kids.
2370220	2376020	But while you're young, get to a big city, try and find really high character successful
2376020	2378100	people to hang out with.
2378100	2383300	Just find people you want to be like or that you admire professionally and personally
2383300	2387740	and try and establish those friendships and try and hang out with them because you rise
2387740	2390980	or fall to the level of your peer group.
2390980	2395260	And the thing about cities is you're just bumping off opportunities.
2395260	2399820	And I've moved to London and my reductive analysis of the U.S. versus Europe is the
2399820	2404460	U.S. is still the best place to make money, Europe's the best place to spend it.
2404460	2408740	So if you're in the making money part of your life, it's hard to beat the U.S. I didn't
2408740	2411660	appreciate the American economy until I left it.
2411700	2412860	Let's start from yesterday.
2412860	2413860	How can we work together?
2413860	2415660	How can we build something together?
2415660	2417740	How can we make money together?
2417740	2421220	London is sort of like a very polite, indefinite maybe.
2421220	2424580	There's very little actual organic value creation in London.
2424580	2428540	It's people servicing other people's wealth that they made elsewhere.
2428540	2433820	There's nothing like America that says to a young person, if you work your ass off and
2433820	2439940	you're really good and you get a little bit lucky, things can happen for you here.
2439980	2444540	All my British friends, they say that they grew up being afraid of tall poppy syndrome,
2444540	2448020	meaning they didn't want to stick out because their teachers would tell them, shut the hell
2448020	2449660	up, get in line.
2449660	2454740	Whereas in America, if you do something interesting, even if you fail, you're rewarded as being
2454740	2456420	a hero of like, well, that's awesome, man.
2456420	2457420	You got after it.
2457420	2460540	Even if it sucked, the outcome wasn't good.
2460540	2462300	We praise you for getting after it.
2462300	2465540	And I think that's a very unique American thing compared to Europe.
2465540	2468780	In Europe, if you stick out, you're chastised.
2468780	2471940	Not only that, but people say in America, we embrace failure.
2471940	2472940	That's not true.
2472940	2474900	But we do tolerate it.
2474900	2478180	And so only one out of seven businesses succeed.
2478180	2481660	So my strategy has been to start nine businesses.
2481660	2484620	And I got to two wins, and all you need is one.
2484620	2488740	And if you aren't trying really hard and taking risks and failing and then knowing to pull
2488740	2494140	the plug and move on, you're not taking advantage of the American embrace of risk and failure.
2494140	2498900	I've never had trouble raising money because of past failures.
2498900	2499900	People didn't mind that.
2499900	2504100	As long as you treated your investor as well, as long as you were a decent person, you didn't
2504100	2507900	do anything stupid or unethical, people don't have a problem funding you again.
2507900	2514780	I've had a lot of failure professionally, but I've never had, let me put it this way,
2514780	2518380	when I couldn't raise money, it wasn't because I had failed before.
2518380	2520460	And that's true in relationships.
2520460	2525980	So yeah, the embrace or the acceptance of failure in America is, it's singular and it's
2525980	2526980	a wonderful thing.
2526980	2529540	And if you aren't trying and taking a lot of riskier, you aren't taking advantage of
2529540	2532660	an economy that's one of the few in the world, one of the few societies.
2532660	2537540	I mean, if I was born in China, I'd probably be in jail because I'm outspoken and say stupid
2537540	2538780	things.
2538780	2543460	If I was born in Europe, I think I'd be a talented business person, but I wouldn't be
2543460	2548460	an entrepreneur that had recognized this success because they don't embrace failure or that's
2548460	2549460	wrong.
2550460	2553620	Can I ask you a question about hard work?
2553620	2559940	And the reason being is I found some, what read as contrary things in your work, or at
2559940	2562180	least in your story and what you write.
2562180	2566020	And so Sean and I have talked a lot about this, about hard work.
2566020	2570380	And I think people who say they work 80 hours a week for a really long time, I think they're
2570380	2573500	either lying or they did a lot of bullshit work.
2573500	2577620	I think it's to work 80 hours a week for an extended period of time, it's incredibly
2577620	2578620	challenging.
2578980	2584140	You talked about, in this book, as well as some of the other blog posts, you're saying,
2584140	2590140	in my 40s, I grinded my ass off, all I was focused on was money, and it worked out, but
2590140	2591140	that's all I did.
2591140	2593940	And I'm happy I did it, but it was really hard work.
2593940	2596500	But then I read about how you delegate a ton.
2596500	2600980	I think you said something even as crazy as you have someone pick out your clothes and
2600980	2602220	you wear mostly the same thing.
2602220	2605060	You have your workout outfit and then your work outfit.
2605060	2611540	And how you at Prophecy Media, you said something like, you only meet with your executive producer
2611540	2612540	twice a month.
2612540	2615260	You only have one hour meeting once a week with the editorial team.
2615260	2622020	You haven't planned vacations in 20 years, and all you do is focus on a handful of things.
2622020	2627620	But even though you're crazy productive now, I don't know, are you still grinding and looking
2627620	2629700	back knowing what you know now?
2629700	2634340	Could you have gotten to where you've gotten without that 80 hour a week for multiple years
2634340	2635340	of work ethic?
2635340	2637660	Well, things have changed dramatically for me now.
2637660	2640180	I'm not working nearly as hard.
2640180	2644620	And I hire a lot of people and I'll over, not over hire, but everyone works hard.
2644620	2649940	But I don't, I mean, when you have a small business and you don't have a lot of money,
2649940	2653460	you know, you just, you got to get, everyone needs, you need to work hard.
2653460	2658060	You need to set an example and you need to create an environment where everyone's working
2658060	2659060	hard.
2659060	2661060	I'm not sure I was ever working 80 hours a week consistently.
2661060	2663620	I definitely had weeks like that.
2663620	2669900	But when I look back on it, kind of, I don't know, 10, 20, 10, 15 years, I don't remember
2669900	2671540	much else other than work.
2671540	2675420	I mean, I worked out when I had kids, I tried to spend some time with my kids.
2675420	2680060	I still found time for fun and vacations, but, you know, I would vacation two weeks
2680060	2681060	a year.
2681060	2684780	Now I vacation a lot more than that.
2684780	2687100	And, but I don't see any way around it.
2687100	2690700	It's really, my kids, when I say my kids, my students, I'll ask them how much money they
2690700	2695380	expect to be making by the time they're 35 and about 90% of them expect to be in the
2695380	2700340	top 1%, which is $750,000 a year in America.
2700340	2702140	And then they'll talk about that.
2702140	2703140	Like that's what I expect.
2703140	2706580	But I'll say, what's most important to you in your life and moving forward?
2706580	2708540	And a lot of the time they say balance.
2708540	2714420	And I'm like, so you expect to be in the top 1% by the time you're 35, but you also believe
2714420	2716420	you're going to have balance in your life?
2716420	2719220	I mean, I don't, I've never seen that.
2719220	2720220	I don't.
2720220	2721220	You can have it all.
2721220	2723700	You just can't have it all at once.
2723700	2726340	And by the way, that's, that may not be the way to go.
2726340	2729580	You may sacrifice, you may say, I want to live a nice kind of balanced life.
2729580	2733180	I'm going to move to a suburb of St. Louis, coach Little League, work 40 hours a week,
2733180	2738900	be a good citizen, find a good partner, you know, coach Little League, have a nice life.
2738900	2739900	Nothing wrong with that.
2739900	2742860	But the majority of the people I know, the young people, think they're going to be in
2742860	2745220	the top 1% and also have balance in their life.
2745220	2746220	And I just, it's ridiculous.
2746220	2750460	I'm like, okay, the only way to get there to achieve that is if you have one thing and
2750460	2757180	that's rich parents, otherwise expect to go all in on your career or scale back your expectations
2757180	2761420	around your economics and your influence because it's a competitive market.
2761420	2765140	And one of the things people can control is how hard they work.
2765140	2769780	I don't think you want to, I don't think you want to work so much that you sacrifice your
2769780	2772180	health or your relationships.
2772180	2774060	There is going to be some trade off with your relationships.
2774060	2776140	I didn't see my kids a lot when they were little.
2776140	2777140	I was divorced.
2777140	2778780	I think it was a contributor to that.
2778780	2782380	I was always working in services companies and never saying no to any opportunity.
2782380	2786380	The CMO of Samsung, can you be in Seoul tomorrow for a board meeting?
2786380	2787380	Sure I can.
2787380	2792820	You know, I mean, I just said yes to everything to try and move the company forward.
2792820	2801700	But I, for a long period, worked very, very hard and sacrificed a lot and it takes a toll.
2801700	2805460	And I did it such that I could have a lot more balance now.
2805460	2810420	But yeah, I don't, this notion, the myth of balance, get over it.
2810420	2814460	If you expect to be influential or economically secure, you're not going to have a lot of
2814460	2816420	balance for a long period of time.
2816420	2820860	Some people are such geniuses that they can work a modest amount of time, make a lot of
2820860	2826420	money, work out, have a great relationship with their parents, be fit, donate time at
2826420	2831100	the ASPCA and have a food blog, assume you are not that person.
2831100	2835740	So just have a sober conversation and also have a sober conversation with your partner.
2835740	2837500	How much money do we expect to have?
2837500	2838940	Who's responsible for making it?
2838940	2840900	What's your approach to spending?
2840900	2842780	Where are we going to live?
2842780	2848980	The number one source of divorce is not infidelity or lack of shared values.
2848980	2852180	It's usually got something to do with money and also 70% of divorce filings are filed
2852180	2855740	by women who still, and we don't like to say this because we like to pretend women have
2855740	2861340	no agency and that they're just doughy little foes.
2861340	2866780	The man loses a business, becomes broke or has a mental breakdown.
2866780	2874420	When a man loses a status as a provider, he's very inclined to be on the wrong end of divorce.
2874420	2875660	So I think a lot about young men.
2875660	2877140	I think a lot about financial security.
2877140	2880980	I think every man should start with the notion that he's going to be responsible for the
2880980	2883380	economic well-being of his household.
2883380	2887500	And by the way, sometimes that means getting out of the way and being more supportive of
2887500	2892100	your partner who happens to be better at that money thing than you.
2892100	2893540	And that's a wonderful thing.
2893540	2900500	But start from a position of this is my responsibility and make sure you're aligned with your partner
2900500	2904580	around this stuff because the thing we don't talk about is that your kids are going to
2904580	2907380	have higher blood pressure if you're economically strained.
2907380	2913100	Kids in low-income households have greater systolic resting blood pressure than kids
2913100	2915060	in middle and upper-income homes.
2915060	2916740	You're much more likely to get divorced.
2916740	2918780	You're much more likely to have a stroke.
2918780	2922380	You're much more likely to be the victim or the perpetrator of domestic violence when
2922380	2924020	you don't have money.
2924020	2927340	You know, America becomes more like itself every day.
2927340	2930540	And that is it's a loving, generous place for people with money.
2930540	2934300	It's a rapacious, violent place for people who don't have money.
2934300	2939340	So all this bullshit that money doesn't buy you happiness, oh my God, is that a myth?
2939340	2944140	I'm not saying you need to be incredibly wealthy, but middle-income people are happier than
2944140	2947660	poor people and wealthy people are happier than middle-income people.
2947660	2948660	That's the bad news.
2948660	2950860	The good news is that it tops out.
2950860	2952860	You get diminishing returns.
2952860	2958580	And you have to be cognizant of when you do get to some level of economic security, that's
2958580	2959980	the means.
2959980	2966940	The ends is such that you can have an exhale, release the anxiety that you feel, and then
2966980	2972380	use the opportunity to really spend a lot of time with your loved ones and cement those
2972380	2973940	relationships.
2973940	2977540	And the problem is you get on the sadonic treadmill and you get so absorbed in your
2977540	2981780	own success and your professional identity and money and making more money that you never
2981780	2983260	get to the ends.
2983260	2986660	You wake up a wealthy person or someone who's financially secure as I always thought about
2986660	2991500	their economic well-being, and you don't really have a great relationship with your kids or
2991500	2995620	you never really leaned into your partnership and thought, okay, let's take time to really
2995660	2997060	enjoy each other's company.
2997060	2999100	Let's do nice things.
2999100	3002820	Your parents die before you have a chance to really spend time with them as adults.
3002820	3005980	I think that happens to a lot of people.
3005980	3009820	They just get so caught up and I need the next promotion.
3009820	3011420	I need the next amount of money.
3011420	3014900	And once I get here, I have someone very close to my life.
3014900	3018620	It's a family member and I'm taking them to Africa and they're like making excuses, but
3018620	3021140	our kids in the choir, they weren't making excuses.
3021140	3025500	I'm like, you realize this is your last chance to go to Africa before you're dead, right?
3025980	3027220	You're 50 fucking years old.
3027220	3029140	When do you go when you're 70?
3029140	3031180	But you got to get back to work an extra day.
3031180	3032900	I mean, what are you thinking?
3032900	3034580	We're going to be dead soon.
3034580	3041980	And I just think so many people don't realize how fast it's going to go by and never really,
3041980	3047420	never really like super, not only super lean into the relationships, but just allow themselves
3047420	3048940	just to have a great time.
3048940	3050380	I'm going to stagecoach this week.
3050380	3052140	I'm going to go to country music festival.
3052140	3056100	I can't stand country, but I'm going.
3056100	3057940	I'm going to buy a pair of boots.
3057940	3061620	I'm going to have a great time and I'm going to do an edible and I'm going to drink a Chiton
3061620	3065940	and I'm going to have arrested adolescents with my friends and I'm going to look ridiculous.
3065940	3069140	And it's like, yeah, why not?
3069140	3070460	Why the fuck not?
3070460	3071020	What am I going to do?
3071020	3073380	Watch C-SPAN all weekend?
3073380	3079100	I mean, anyway, I can't stand it when people who are blessed with being in this country
3079180	3082540	have some level of economic security, have people in their life that love them and they
3082540	3088780	love and they don't like crazy lean into it because you guys are younger than I can.
3088780	3090660	It just goes so goddamn fast.
3090660	3091660	It's just crazy.
3091660	3093820	It is just crazy how fast it goes.
3093820	3094820	Anyways.
3094820	3098700	Well, I don't know how to respond to that, Scott.
3098700	3099940	Here's what I do know.
3099940	3104860	I feel like I learned something and I feel a little bit bad inside at the same time.
3104860	3109860	I feel a little bit good and you made me feel a little bit bad and I need to go and I need
3109860	3111580	to like burp or something.
3111580	3113500	I need to get a little bit out of my system.
3113500	3116140	I just need to unwind from that.
3116140	3118020	Do they not have Zoloft in London?
3118020	3120540	You know, I haven't hit the anti-depressant.
3120540	3121980	I just had ketamine therapy though.
3121980	3122980	That was a trip.
3122980	3128020	No, I'm trying to, I'm trying to just, you know, like the good news is I hate my life
3128020	3133300	less and less every day, so I'm sort of getting there.
3133300	3134860	I'm sort of getting there.
3134860	3139260	You're like if Mitch Hedberg had a podcast and opened an LLC.
3139260	3141980	Are we going to talk about, are we going to talk about my book?
3141980	3146540	Do you think I got to number one talking about like doing therapy with you guys on these
3146540	3148140	Joey Baganonas podcast?
3148140	3149420	Are you going to bring up my book?
3149420	3150420	Yeah.
3150420	3151420	Tell us about the book.
3151420	3152420	Okay.
3152420	3156420	We talked a little bit about the book, but tell us the floor is yours.
3156420	3159420	Make your case as to what I'm going to get out of this book because I'm going to buy
3159420	3160420	it and I'm going to read it.
3160420	3161420	Okay.
3161420	3162420	Thanks for that.
3162420	3164740	It's a different level of enthusiasm if you give me a little teaser of what I'm going
3164740	3165740	to get out of it.
3165740	3166740	Okay.
3166740	3169300	So the algebra of wealth is the following.
3169300	3175340	Find your talent, focus, workshop your 20s in an industry that will pay you.
3175340	3179420	Once you have a certain amount of momentum professionally, really try and develop a savings
3179420	3180420	muscle.
3180420	3183260	Wealth isn't about how much you make, it's about how much you spend.
3183260	3186220	Try and just get to the point at a fairly early stage where you spend less than you
3186220	3187220	make.
3187220	3188220	That is very difficult.
3188220	3191740	The brightest companies and minds in the world are all here to convince you that an
3191740	3196060	upgrade from economy to economy comfort, to economy plus, to business classes and investment
3196060	3197060	in yourself.
3197060	3198380	No, it's not.
3198380	3199380	It's consumption.
3199380	3201900	Don't try and impress other people with your shit.
3201900	3203820	No one's as concerned with your shit as you are.
3203820	3207460	You don't need to order a bottle of vodka at a club for 450 bucks.
3207460	3209940	Get a Hyundai for God's sakes.
3209940	3211060	Travel coach.
3211060	3212060	Save money.
3212060	3213060	Start saving money early.
3213060	3214060	Lean in.
3214060	3216420	If you're young, lean into your advantage and that is you have a lot of time.
3216420	3218220	Develop that savings muscle.
3218220	3221820	Diversify the moment you have any real capital.
3221820	3224900	Start diversifying that way no matter what happens.
3224900	3225900	You have Kevlar.
3225900	3228700	You can have a stock go to zero and a bullet hits you in the chest.
3228700	3231580	It doesn't kill you because you're diversified.
3231580	3236660	Then take advantage of the flaw in the species and that's time and recognize that time will
3236660	3238100	go faster than you think.
3238100	3241540	If you're just a little bit of discipline, a little bit of maturity, a little bit of
3241540	3246380	that savings muscle early, that the S&P is up 11% a year since 2008.
3246380	3247580	Well, that sounds boring.
3247780	3253740	Now that means every 21 years your investments are up 8x and that 21 years will go really
3253740	3254740	fast.
3254740	3256340	So hope you sell a best selling book.
3256340	3257700	Hope your company goes public.
3257700	3262700	Hope your album goes double platinum or some rich uncle dies and leaves you everything.
3262700	3267180	But just in case, make sure you're financially secure and I can get you there.
3267180	3272140	If you follow these principles and show a little bit of discipline, a little bit of maturity
3272140	3274820	because the good news is I can get you rich.
3274820	3277460	The bad news is the answer is slowly.
3277460	3279260	We can get you there.
3279260	3285900	So the algebra of wealth equals focus plus stoicism times time times diversification.
3285900	3287340	That's the formula.
3287340	3288340	That's the formula.
3288340	3289340	You're the formula guy.
3289340	3293220	A lot of your talks, you use formulas to explain stuff.
3293220	3295500	You've had the algebra of happiness, now the algebra of wealth.
3295500	3300020	Is this going to be a whole algebra of blank series?
3300020	3301780	Any time I see that, I'm into it.
3301780	3304020	If it's an equation, I'm into it.
3304020	3308060	So humans need constructs to remember things.
3308060	3311540	You can read a book and if it doesn't have constructs or visualizations, it's pretty
3311540	3313020	easy to forget about it.
3313020	3315340	So I really like constructs, equations.
3315340	3320340	I read the algebra of happiness, algebra of wealth out today and I'm about to sign a three
3320340	3321340	book deal.
3321340	3325940	I'm writing the algebra of masculinity, the algebra of work, and the algebra of mating.
3325940	3329300	Those are three topics I'm super interested in and I want to try and do enough research
3329300	3332740	where I can distill it down to some best practices that people can hold on to.
3333460	3335380	Well, I want to talk about the first variable in this.
3335380	3338500	You said focus, because we talked about socialism.
3338500	3339500	I know about time.
3339500	3341780	I know about diversification, but teach me about focus.
3341780	3345900	I'm pretty bad at focus, trying to get better.
3345900	3349700	Give me a couple words on focus as part of this equation.
3349700	3354300	If you have a side hustle, you need to find a different main hustle.
3354300	3359340	You're better off with the time you spent on a side hustle, investing that incremental
3359340	3360820	effort in your main hustle.
3360820	3364340	If you constantly find it, a side hustle is fine if you're investigating a new main
3364340	3367860	hustle, but the way you get wealthy is not a variety of things.
3367860	3369740	It's being really great at one thing.
3369740	3375580	So that's the focus and the term we use is mastery or ninja like capability, but try
3375580	3382140	and find something you could become great at and that's not easy.
3382140	3386340	But also, again, we talked about this before, finding an industry that's not very sexy because
3386380	3395700	if you're in the top 10% of tax law or of installing HVAC or energy efficient HVAC,
3395700	3401220	or you're in the top 10% of people who know how to install soapstone kitchen counters,
3401220	3403860	you're going to make a really good living.
3403860	3407700	Taking care of your kids is just so much fun.
3407700	3413100	Being able to be there for your parents is economically, is just really exciting and
3413140	3414580	really a lot of fun.
3414580	3418740	And I think young people mistake passion for their hobbies, not recognizing when they get
3418740	3424980	older to be able to give money away, to be able to do nice things, to be able to relax
3424980	3427380	with your partner.
3427380	3428860	It's just super enjoyable.
3428860	3434260	It's almost as fun as spinning to, I mean, that shit is fun.
3434260	3435940	That is really enjoyable.
3435940	3439980	And so put yourself in a position when you're a little bit older because it'll go really
3439980	3444260	fast to just do wonderful things with people you care about.
3444260	3448940	And the way you get there is by making more than you spend saving, but the first thing
3448940	3451740	you got to do is find the focus.
3451740	3453700	Find something.
3453700	3457020	We live in a specialist economy.
3457020	3461780	Find something like, try and just think, could I be great at this?
3461780	3462900	Could I be great at this?
3462900	3466460	That's not the question because if you become great at it, trust me, you'll become passionate
3466460	3467460	about it.
3467460	3469500	And you can't become great at anything you hate.
3469500	3471860	It's just going to be automatically be screened out.
3471860	3474540	I'm not suggesting drudgery is the way.
3474540	3477540	If you find something drudgerous or whatever the term is, you're just not going to be great
3477540	3478780	at it.
3478780	3480660	But I found consulting.
3480660	3484980	I never, I didn't know what consulting was when I was in college, even business school.
3484980	3488780	I figured out, wait, people will pay you to wrench your brain?
3488780	3489780	Wow.
3489780	3493260	And I was always really good at establishing these proxy father-son relationships with
3493260	3495100	powerful men.
3495100	3500100	And then basically my core deal with them is, I understand brand better than you.
3500100	3501100	You're the CMO.
3501100	3502380	I'm going to make you the CEO in three years.
3502380	3505940	In exchange for that, you're going to pay my company a million dollars a year to answer
3505940	3509300	very deep, hard questions.
3509300	3512820	And I figured that out at kind of my late 20s, which was a blessing.
3512820	3515540	And then when I sold the company, I'm like, I don't want to be in services anymore.
3515540	3516660	It's a young person's business.
3516660	3518460	I'm sick of being on planes.
3518460	3520580	So I had to workshop my life again.
3520580	3522260	And then I figured out, okay, I'm a good teacher.
3522260	3523260	What does it mean to be a good teacher?
3523260	3524780	It means you have to be a good storyteller.
3524780	3526980	But what if I story told in different mediums?
3526980	3527980	Could I make money in books?
3527980	3529380	Could I make money speaking?
3529380	3531940	Could I make money in podcasts?
3531940	3533700	And I figured out, yeah, I'm good at this.
3533700	3535980	I could even be great someday.
3535980	3539420	And that mastery has led to a really nice life.
3539420	3545980	But I've always tried to spend reasonably, spend less than I was making, sometimes more
3545980	3548060	than others.
3548060	3550180	I finally learned to diversify the hard way.
3550180	3554820	I lost everything twice in 2000 and again in 2008, because I thought it was so awesome
3554820	3558460	that whatever is my focus, this is naturally going to be successful through my sheer force
3558460	3560060	of character.
3560060	3561420	That's not true.
3561420	3567700	So I started diversifying and just kind of follow these basic principles and let time
3567700	3571220	take over and really started saving a lot of money in my 40s.
3571220	3577820	I deployed an army of capital to start fighting and killing for me and my family and my sleep.
3577820	3586660	And that army just grew in a bull market and came home with just immense spoils for me
3586660	3590380	because I deployed this army early and often and I kept adding to it.
3590380	3592380	I feel like, here's a tank.
3592380	3593380	All right.
3593380	3594380	Okay.
3594380	3595380	I'm saving money.
3595380	3596380	I'm not going to have the fat apartment.
3596380	3597380	All right.
3597380	3598380	Okay.
3598380	3599380	Here's some more artillery.
3599380	3600380	Go kill more people and come home with money.
3600380	3601900	That's a little bit much.
3601900	3602900	Anyways.
3602900	3604780	We're still working off of that one.
3604780	3605780	Yeah.
3605780	3606780	Still working through that one.
3606820	3607820	Wrong choice.
3607820	3608820	Wrong choice of words.
3608820	3609820	Accoutrements.
3609820	3611300	The accoutrements of my army.
3611300	3613660	Scott, thanks for coming on, man.
3613660	3617180	And everybody go buy the book, the algebra of wealth.
3617180	3620500	He has to be number one on the charts because he needs our affirmation and let's give it
3620500	3621500	to him.
3621500	3622500	Thanks, guys.
3622500	3623500	Thanks for your success.
3623500	3624500	Thanks, Sam.
3624500	3625500	Thanks, Sean.
3625500	3626500	And thanks, Ari.
3626500	3627500	Thank you.
3627500	3628500	Bye.
3628500	3629500	Bye.
3629500	3630500	Bye.
3630500	3631500	Bye.
3631500	3632500	Bye.
3632500	3633500	Bye.
3633500	3634500	Bye.
3634500	3635500	Bye.
3635500	3638500	Bye.
