9. **Takeaways from Failure**: Learn from your mistakes, such as the importance of diversification after experiencing losses during market downturns.

10. **Affirmation and Support**: Seek support from peers, mentors, or communities, like the listeners of "The BiggerPockets Real Estate Podcast," to find affirmation and encouragement in your journey to financial independence.
