00:00.000 --> 00:03.840
Let me pull out an old differential equations textbook that I learned from in college,

00:03.840 --> 00:09.520
and let's turn to this funny little exercise in here that asks the reader to compute e to the power

00:09.520 --> 00:15.600
at, where a, we're told, is going to be a matrix, and the insinuation seems to be that the results

00:15.600 --> 00:21.120
will also be a matrix. It then offers several examples for what you might plug in for a.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.560
Now, taking out a context, putting a matrix into an exponent like this probably seems like total

00:27.440 --> 00:31.760
nonsense, but what it refers to is an extremely beautiful operation, and the reason it shows up

00:31.760 --> 00:36.480
in this book is that it's useful. It's used to solve a very important class of differential

00:36.480 --> 00:41.440
equations. In turn, given that the universe is often written in the language of differential

00:41.440 --> 00:46.400
equations, you see this pop up in physics all the time too, especially in quantum mechanics,

00:46.400 --> 00:51.120
where matrix exponents are littered throughout the place. They play a particularly prominent role.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.720
This has a lot to do with Schrodinger's equation, which we'll touch on a bit later,

00:54.720 --> 00:59.440
and it may also help in understanding your romantic relationships, but again, all in due time.

01:05.520 --> 01:09.680
A big part of the reason I want to cover this topic is that there is an extremely nice way to

01:09.680 --> 01:14.800
visualize what matrix exponents are actually doing using flow that not a lot of people seem to talk

01:14.800 --> 01:20.240
about. But for the bulk of this chapter, let's start by laying out what exactly the operation is,

01:20.240 --> 01:23.520
and see if we can get a feel for what kinds of problems it helps us to solve.

01:24.240 --> 01:28.320
The first thing you should know is that this is not some bizarre way to multiply the constant

01:28.320 --> 01:34.000
e by itself multiple times. You would be right to call that nonsense. The actual definition

01:34.000 --> 01:38.320
is related to a certain infinite polynomial for describing real number powers of e,

01:38.320 --> 01:43.200
what we call its Taylor series. For example, if I took the number two and plugged it into this

01:43.200 --> 01:49.360
polynomial, then as you add more and more terms, each of which looks like some power of two divided

01:49.360 --> 02:01.120
by some factorial. The sum approaches a number near 7.389, and this number is precisely e times e.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.040
If you increment this input by one, then somewhat miraculously, no matter where you started from,

02:07.040 --> 02:11.040
the effect on the output is always to multiply it by another factor of e.

02:12.160 --> 02:16.080
For reasons that you're going to see in a bit, mathematicians became interested in plugging

02:16.080 --> 02:21.040
all kinds of things into this polynomial, things like complex numbers, and for our purposes today,

02:21.040 --> 02:25.680
matrices, even when those objects do not immediately make sense as exponents.

02:26.480 --> 02:31.120
What some authors do is give this infinite polynomial the name exp when you plug in more

02:31.120 --> 02:36.400
exotic inputs. It's a gentle nod to the connection that this has to exponential functions in the

02:36.400 --> 02:40.240
case of real numbers, even though obviously these inputs don't make sense as exponents.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.000
However, an equally common convention is to give a much less gentle nod to the connection and just

02:46.080 --> 02:50.320
abbreviate the whole thing as e to the power of whatever object you're plugging in,

02:50.320 --> 02:54.400
whether that's a complex number or a matrix, or all sorts of more exotic objects.

02:54.960 --> 03:00.160
So while this equation is a theorem for real numbers, it's a definition for more exotic inputs.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.840
Cynically, you could call this a blatant abuse of notation.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.720
More charitably, you might view it as an example of the beautiful cycle between discovery and

03:08.720 --> 03:14.080
invention in math. In either case, plugging in a matrix even to a polynomial might seem a little

03:14.080 --> 03:19.440
strange, so let's be clear on what we mean here. The matrix has to have the same number of rows and

03:19.440 --> 03:25.200
columns. That way, you can multiply it by itself according to the usual rules of matrix multiplication.

03:25.200 --> 03:30.960
This is what we mean by squaring it. Similarly, if you were to take that result and then multiply

03:30.960 --> 03:35.680
it by the original matrix again, this is what we mean by cubing the matrix.

03:37.760 --> 03:42.320
If you carry on like this, you can take any whole number power of a matrix. It's perfectly

03:42.320 --> 03:47.440
sensible. In this context, powers still mean exactly what you would expect, repeated multiplication.

03:54.000 --> 03:58.240
Each term in this polynomial is scaled by one divided by some factorial,

03:58.240 --> 04:02.240
and with matrices, all that means is that you multiply each component by that number.

04:03.040 --> 04:07.360
Likewise, it always makes sense to add together two matrices. This is something that you again

04:07.360 --> 04:13.280
do term by term. The astute among you might ask how sensible it is to take this out to infinity,

04:13.280 --> 04:17.200
which would be a great question, one that I'm largely going to postpone the answer to,

04:17.200 --> 04:22.720
but I can show you one pretty fun example here now. Take this 2 by 2 matrix that has negative

04:22.720 --> 04:28.240
pi and pi sitting off its diagonal entries. Let's see what the sum gives. The first term

04:28.240 --> 04:32.640
is the identity matrix. This is actually what we mean by definition when we raise a matrix to

04:32.640 --> 04:38.720
the zeroth power. Then we add the matrix itself, which gives us the pi off the diagonal terms,

04:38.720 --> 04:43.680
and then add half of the matrix squared. And continuing on, I'll have the computer keep

04:43.680 --> 04:48.720
adding more and more terms, each of which requires taking one more matrix product to get the new power

04:48.720 --> 04:54.480
and then adding it to a running tally. And as it keeps going, it seems to be approaching a stable

04:54.480 --> 05:00.160
value, which is around negative one times the identity matrix. In this sense, we say the infinite

05:00.160 --> 05:05.440
sum equals that negative identity. By the end of this video, my hope is that this particular

05:05.440 --> 05:10.400
fact comes to make total sense to you. For any of you familiar with Euler's famous identity,

05:10.400 --> 05:15.440
this is essentially the matrix version of that. It turns out that in general, no matter what

05:15.440 --> 05:21.040
matrix you start with, as you add more and more terms, you eventually approach some stable value,

05:21.040 --> 05:23.680
though sometimes it can take quite a while before you get there.

05:24.160 --> 05:32.960
Just seeing the definition like this in isolation raises all kinds of questions. Most notably,

05:32.960 --> 05:37.200
why would mathematicians and physicists be interested in torturing their poor matrices this

05:37.200 --> 05:42.240
way? What problems are they trying to solve? And if you're anything like me, a new operation is

05:42.240 --> 05:47.680
only satisfying when you have a clear view of what it's trying to do, some sense of how to predict

05:47.680 --> 05:52.400
the output based on the input before you actually crunch the numbers. How on earth could you have

05:52.400 --> 05:57.680
predicted that the matrix with pi off the diagonals results in a negative identity matrix like this?

05:58.960 --> 06:03.120
Often in math, you should view the definition not as a starting point, but as a target.

06:03.680 --> 06:08.240
Contrary to the structure of textbooks, mathematicians do not start by making definitions

06:08.240 --> 06:12.800
and enlisting a lot of theorems and proving them and then showing some examples. The process of

06:12.800 --> 06:18.080
discovering math typically goes the other way around. They start by chewing on specific problems

06:18.080 --> 06:22.640
and then generalizing those problems, then coming up with constructs that might be helpful in those

06:22.640 --> 06:28.080
general cases, and only then do you write down a new definition or extend an old one.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.960
As to what sorts of specific examples might motivate matrix exponents,

06:32.960 --> 06:38.640
two come to mind. One involving relationships and the other quantum mechanics. Let's start with

06:38.640 --> 06:47.520
relationships. Suppose we have two lovers, let's call them Romeo and Juliet, and let's let X

06:47.600 --> 06:54.320
represent Juliet's love for Romeo and Y represent his love for her, both of which are going to be

06:54.320 --> 06:59.440
values that change with time. This is an example that we actually touched on in chapter one.

06:59.440 --> 07:04.000
It's based on a Steven Strogett's article, but it's okay if you didn't see that. The way their

07:04.000 --> 07:09.680
relationship works is that the rate at which Juliet's love for Romeo changes, the derivative of this

07:09.680 --> 07:16.880
value, is equal to negative one times Romeo's love for her. So in other words, when Romeo is expressing

07:16.880 --> 07:23.200
cool disinterest, that's when Juliet's feelings actually increase, whereas if he becomes too infatuated,

07:23.200 --> 07:29.760
her interest will start to fade. Romeo, on the other hand, is the opposite. The rate of change of

07:29.760 --> 07:35.840
his love is equal to the size of Juliet's love. So while Juliet is mad at him, his affections tend to

07:35.840 --> 07:43.920
decrease. Whereas if she loves him, that's when his feelings grow. Of course, neither one of these

07:43.920 --> 07:49.520
numbers is holding still. As Romeo's love increases in response to Juliet, her equation

07:49.520 --> 07:55.920
continues to apply and drives her love down. Both of these equations always apply from each

07:55.920 --> 08:01.120
infinitesimal point in time to the next, so every slight change to one value immediately

08:01.120 --> 08:06.960
influences the rate of change of the other. This is a system of differential equations.

08:06.960 --> 08:12.640
It's a puzzle where your challenge is to find explicit functions for X of t and Y of t that

08:12.720 --> 08:17.920
make both of these expressions true. Now, as systems of differential equations go,

08:17.920 --> 08:23.040
this one is on the simpler side. Enough so that many calculus students could probably just guess

08:23.040 --> 08:28.160
at an answer. But keep in mind, it's not enough to find some pair of functions that makes this

08:28.160 --> 08:33.680
true. If you want to actually predict where Romeo and Juliet end up after some starting point,

08:33.680 --> 08:38.800
you have to make sure that your functions match the initial set of conditions at time t equals zero.

08:39.600 --> 08:44.400
More to the point, our actual goal today is to systematically solve more general versions

08:44.400 --> 08:48.880
of this equation without guessing and checking, and it's that question that leads us to matrix

08:48.880 --> 08:54.400
exponents. Very often, when you have multiple changing values like this, it's helpful to

08:54.400 --> 08:59.360
package them together as coordinates of a single point in a higher dimensional space. So for Romeo

08:59.360 --> 09:04.240
and Juliet, think of their relationship as a point in a 2D space, the X-coordinate capturing

09:04.240 --> 09:14.720
Juliet's feelings, and the Y-coordinate capturing Romeo's. Sometimes it's helpful to picture this

09:14.720 --> 09:19.920
state as an arrow from the origin, other times just as a point. All that really matters is that it

09:19.920 --> 09:25.840
encodes two numbers, and moving forward, we'll be writing that as a column vector. And of course,

09:25.840 --> 09:30.800
this is all a function of time. You might picture the rate of change of this state,

09:30.800 --> 09:36.080
the thing that packages together the derivative of X and the derivative of Y, as a kind of velocity

09:36.080 --> 09:41.440
vector in this state space, something that tugs at our point in some direction and with some magnitude

09:41.440 --> 09:48.800
that indicates how quickly it's changing. Remember, the rule here is that the rate of change of X

09:48.800 --> 09:55.680
is negative Y, and the rate of change of Y is X. Set up as vectors like this, we could rewrite the

09:55.680 --> 10:01.280
right-hand side of this equation as a product of this matrix with the original vector, X, Y.

10:01.920 --> 10:08.960
The top row encodes Juliet's rule, and the bottom row encodes Romeo's rule. So what we have here

10:08.960 --> 10:14.080
is a differential equation telling us that the rate of change of some vector is equal to a certain

10:14.080 --> 10:22.400
matrix times itself. In a moment, we'll talk about how matrix exponentiation solves this kind of

10:22.400 --> 10:27.440
equation. But before that, let me show you a simpler way that we can solve this particular system,

10:27.440 --> 10:32.640
one that uses pure geometry, and it helps set the stage for visualizing matrix exponents a bit later.

10:34.080 --> 10:37.280
This matrix from our system is a 90-degree rotation matrix.

10:38.800 --> 10:42.480
For any of you rusty on how to think about matrices as transformations,

10:42.480 --> 10:47.520
there's a video all about it on this channel, a series, really. The basic idea is that when

10:47.520 --> 10:54.880
you multiply a matrix by the vector 1, 0, it pulls out the first column. And similarly,

10:54.880 --> 11:01.280
if you multiply it by 0, 1, that pulls out the second column. What this means is that when you

11:01.280 --> 11:06.960
look at a matrix, you can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors,

11:06.960 --> 11:13.120
known as the basis vectors. The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling and adding

11:13.120 --> 11:18.640
these two basis results by that vector's coordinates. So looking back at the matrix

11:18.640 --> 11:23.680
from our system, notice how from its columns, we can tell it takes the first basis vector to 0, 1,

11:23.680 --> 11:29.040
and the second to negative 1, 0, hence why I'm calling it the 90-degree rotation matrix.

11:31.040 --> 11:36.880
What it means for our equation is that it's saying wherever Romeo and Juliet are in this state space,

11:36.880 --> 11:41.920
their rate of change has to look like a 90-degree rotation of this position vector.

11:42.480 --> 11:46.640
The only way velocity can permanently be perpendicular to position like this

11:46.640 --> 11:51.280
is when you rotate around the origin in circular motion, never growing or shrinking because the

11:51.280 --> 11:58.880
rate of change has no component in the direction of the position. More specifically, since the

11:58.880 --> 12:05.360
length of this velocity vector equals the length of the position vector, then for each unit of time,

12:05.360 --> 12:10.640
the distance that this covers is equal to one radius's worth of arc length along that circle.

12:12.240 --> 12:17.760
In other words, it rotates at one radian per unit time, so in particular, it would take

12:17.760 --> 12:24.560
two pi units of time to make a full revolution. If you want to describe this kind of rotation

12:24.560 --> 12:29.360
with a formula, we can use a more general rotation matrix, which looks like this.

12:30.320 --> 12:34.400
Again, we can read it in terms of the columns. Notice how the first column tells us that it

12:34.400 --> 12:41.360
takes that first basis vector to cosine of t, sine of t, and the second column tells us that

12:41.360 --> 12:46.720
it takes the second basis vector to negative sine of t, cosine of t, both of which are consistent

12:46.720 --> 12:52.560
with rotating by t radians. So, to solve the system, if you want to predict where Romeo and

12:52.560 --> 12:58.800
Juliet end up after t units of time, you can multiply this matrix by their initial state.

13:00.240 --> 13:04.400
The active viewers among you might also enjoy taking a moment to pause and confirm that the

13:04.400 --> 13:09.440
explicit formula as you get out of this for x of t and y of t really do satisfy the system of

13:09.440 --> 13:19.760
differential equations that we started with. The mathematician in you might wonder if it's

13:19.760 --> 13:24.720
possible to solve not just this specific system, but equations like it for any other matrix,

13:24.720 --> 13:30.080
no matter what its coefficients. To ask this question is to set yourself up to rediscover

13:30.080 --> 13:35.440
matrix exponents. The main goal for today is for you to understand how this equation lets you

13:35.440 --> 13:40.880
intuitively picture the operation which we write as e raised to a matrix, and on the flip side,

13:40.880 --> 13:45.440
how being able to compute matrix exponents lets you explicitly solve this equation.

13:46.320 --> 13:51.280
A much less whimsical example is Schrodinger's famous equation, which is the fundamental equation

13:51.280 --> 13:57.040
describing how systems in quantum mechanics change over time. It looks pretty intimidating,

13:57.040 --> 14:00.880
and I mean it's quantum mechanics, so of course it will, but it's actually not that different

14:00.880 --> 14:06.240
from the Romeo-Juliet setup. This symbol here refers to a certain vector. It's a vector that

14:06.240 --> 14:10.640
packages together all the information you might care about in a system, like the various particles,

14:10.640 --> 14:15.600
positions, and momenta. It's analogous to our simpler 2D vector that encoded all the information

14:15.600 --> 14:21.600
about Romeo and Juliet. The equation says that the rate at which this state vector changes looks

14:21.600 --> 14:26.880
like a certain matrix times itself. There are a number of things that make Schrodinger's equation

14:26.880 --> 14:31.360
notably more complicated, but in the back of your mind you might think of it as a target point that

14:31.360 --> 14:36.560
you and I can build up to, with simpler examples, like Romeo and Juliet, offering more friendly

14:36.560 --> 14:42.240
stepping stones along the way. Actually, the simplest example, which is tied to ordinary

14:42.240 --> 14:47.680
real number powers of e, is the one-dimensional case. This is when you have a single changing value,

14:47.680 --> 14:53.360
and its rate of change equals some constant times itself. So the bigger the value, the faster it grows.

14:54.320 --> 14:59.280
Most people are more comfortable visualizing this with a graph, where the higher the value

14:59.280 --> 15:04.240
of the graph, the steeper its slope, resulting in this ever-steepening upward curve. Just keep

15:04.240 --> 15:08.000
in mind that when we get to higher dimensional variants, graphs are a lot less helpful.

15:09.040 --> 15:13.200
This is a highly important equation in its own right. It's a very powerful concept when the

15:13.200 --> 15:18.000
rate of change of a value is proportional to the value itself. This is the equation governing

15:18.000 --> 15:23.120
things like compound interest, or the early stages of population growth, before the effects of

15:23.120 --> 15:29.040
limited resources kick in, or the early stages of an epidemic, while most of the population is susceptible.

15:31.760 --> 15:37.280
Calculus students all learn about how the derivative of e to the rt is r times itself.

15:38.320 --> 15:42.880
In other words, this self-reinforcing growth phenomenon is the same thing as exponential

15:42.880 --> 15:50.720
growth, and e to the rt solves this equation. Actually, a better way to think about it is that

15:50.720 --> 15:55.200
there are many different solutions to this equation, one for each initial condition,

15:55.200 --> 16:00.080
something like an initial investment size or an initial population, which we'll just call x0.

16:00.800 --> 16:05.680
Notice, by the way, how the higher the value for x0, the higher the initial slope of the

16:05.680 --> 16:09.760
resulting solution, which should make a complete sense given the equation.

16:11.520 --> 16:18.080
The function e to the rt is just a solution when the initial condition is 1, but if you multiply

16:18.080 --> 16:22.800
by any other initial condition, you get a new function which still satisfies this property,

16:22.800 --> 16:28.560
it still has a derivative which is r times itself. But this time it starts at x0, since

16:28.560 --> 16:33.680
e to the 0 is 1. This is worth highlighting before we generalize to more dimensions.

16:33.680 --> 16:37.600
Do not think of the exponential part as being a solution in and of itself.

16:37.600 --> 16:42.320
Think of it as something that acts on an initial condition in order to give a solution.

16:42.800 --> 16:50.320
You see, up in the two-dimensional case, when we have a changing vector whose

16:50.320 --> 16:56.320
rate of change is constrained to be some matrix times itself, what the solution looks like is also

16:56.320 --> 17:01.760
an exponential term acting on a given initial condition. But the exponential part in that case

17:01.760 --> 17:07.440
will produce a matrix that changes with time, and the initial condition is a vector. In fact,

17:07.440 --> 17:11.920
you should think of the definition of matrix exponentiation as being heavily motivated

17:11.920 --> 17:16.960
by making sure that this fact is true. For example, if we look back at the system that

17:16.960 --> 17:23.040
popped up with Romeo and Juliet, the claim now is that solutions look like e raised to this

17:23.040 --> 17:28.720
0, negative 1, 1, 0 matrix, all times time, multiplied by some initial condition.

17:29.440 --> 17:33.360
But we've already seen the solution in this case. We know it looks like a rotation matrix

17:33.360 --> 17:37.840
times the initial condition. So let's take a moment to roll up our sleeves and compute the

17:37.840 --> 17:42.240
exponential term using the definition that I mentioned at the start and see if it lines up.

17:43.120 --> 17:48.320
Remember, writing e to the power of a matrix is a shorthand, a shorthand for plugging it in

17:48.320 --> 17:54.320
to this long infinite polynomial, the Taylor series for e to the x. I know it might seem

17:54.320 --> 17:59.360
pretty complicated to do this, but trust me, it's very satisfying how this particular one turns out.

18:00.080 --> 18:04.240
If you actually sit down and you compute successive powers of this matrix,

18:04.240 --> 18:20.160
what you'd notice is that they fall into a cycling pattern every four iterations.

18:27.440 --> 18:30.800
This should make sense given that we know it's a 90 degree rotation matrix.

18:31.360 --> 18:36.800
So when you add together all infinitely many matrices, term by term, each term in the result

18:36.800 --> 18:41.920
looks like a polynomial in t with some nice cycling pattern in its coefficients,

18:41.920 --> 18:44.320
all of them scaled by the relevant factorial term.

18:45.600 --> 18:49.920
Those of you who are savvy with Taylor series might be able to recognize that each one of

18:49.920 --> 18:55.280
these components is the Taylor series for either sine or cosine, though in that top right corner's

18:55.280 --> 19:01.920
case it's actually negative sine. So what we get from the computation is exactly the rotation

19:01.920 --> 19:11.440
matrix we had from before. To me, this is extremely beautiful. We have two completely different ways

19:11.440 --> 19:16.240
of reasoning about the same system and they give us the same answer. I mean, it's reassuring that

19:16.240 --> 19:20.480
they do, but it is wild just how different the mode of thought is when you're chugging through

19:20.480 --> 19:25.200
this polynomial versus when you're geometrically reasoning about what a velocity perpendicular

19:25.200 --> 19:30.560
to a position must imply. Hopefully, the fact that these line up inspires a little confidence

19:30.560 --> 19:35.920
in the claim that matrix exponents really do solve systems like this. This explains the

19:35.920 --> 19:40.240
computation we saw at the start, by the way, with the matrix that had negative pi and pi

19:40.240 --> 19:45.280
off the diagonals, producing the negative identity. This expression is exponentiating

19:45.280 --> 19:51.120
a 90 degree rotation matrix times pi, which is another way to describe what the Romeo-Juliet

19:51.120 --> 19:57.520
setup does after pi units of time. As we now know, that has the effect of rotating everything 180

19:57.520 --> 20:03.920
degrees in this state space, which is the same as multiplying by negative one. Also, for any of you

20:03.920 --> 20:08.560
familiar with imaginary number exponents, this particular example is probably ringing a ton of

20:08.560 --> 20:14.400
bells. It is 100% analogous. In fact, we could have framed the entire example where Romeo and

20:14.400 --> 20:19.120
Juliet's feelings were packaged into a complex number, and the rate of change of that complex

20:19.120 --> 20:24.560
number would have been i times itself, since multiplication by i also acts like a 90 degree

20:24.560 --> 20:30.160
rotation. The same exact line of reasoning, both analytic and geometric, would have led to this

20:30.160 --> 20:36.240
whole idea that e to the power i t describes rotation. These are actually two of many different

20:36.240 --> 20:40.560
examples throughout math and physics, when you find yourself exponentiating some object which

20:40.560 --> 20:46.640
acts as a 90 degree rotation times time. It shows up with quaternions or many of the matrices that

20:46.640 --> 20:51.840
pop up in quantum mechanics. In all of these cases, we have this really neat general idea

20:51.840 --> 20:56.880
that if you take some operation that rotates 90 degrees in some plane, often it's a plane in

20:56.880 --> 21:02.320
some high-dimensional space that we can't visualize, then what we get by exponentiating that operation

21:02.320 --> 21:07.040
times time is something that generates all other rotations in that same plane.

21:09.360 --> 21:13.600
One of the more complicated variations on this same theme is Schrodinger's equation.

21:13.600 --> 21:18.640
It's not just that this has the derivative of a state equal some matrix times that state form.

21:19.280 --> 21:25.040
The nature of the relevant matrix here is such that the equation also describes a kind of rotation,

21:25.040 --> 21:29.200
though in many applications of Schrodinger's equation it'll be a rotation in a kind of function

21:29.200 --> 21:34.080
space. It's a little more involved though because typically there's a combination of many different

21:34.080 --> 21:38.880
rotations. It takes time to really dig into this equation, and I would love to do that in a later

21:38.880 --> 21:45.200
chapter, but right now I cannot help but at least allude to the fact that this imaginary unit i that

21:45.200 --> 21:50.640
sits so impishly in such a fundamental equation for all of the universe is playing basically the same

21:50.640 --> 21:56.320
role as the matrix from our Romeo and Juliet example. What this i communicates is that the

21:56.320 --> 22:02.880
rate of change of a certain state is, in a sense, perpendicular to that state, and hence that the

22:02.880 --> 22:06.560
way things have to evolve over time will involve a kind of oscillation.

22:10.960 --> 22:16.240
But matrix exponentiation can do so much more than just rotation. You can always visualize

22:16.240 --> 22:21.840
these sorts of differential equations using a vector field. The idea is that this equation

22:21.840 --> 22:27.040
tells us the velocity of a state is entirely determined by its position, so what we do is go

22:27.040 --> 22:31.920
to every point in the space and draw a little vector indicating what the velocity of a state

22:31.920 --> 22:37.840
must be if it passes through that point. For our type of equation, this means that we go to each

22:37.840 --> 22:56.480
point v in space and we attach the vector m times v. To intuitively understand how any given initial

22:56.480 --> 23:01.840
condition will evolve, you let it flow along this field with a velocity always matching whatever

23:01.840 --> 23:07.600
vector it's sitting on at any given point in time. So if the claim is that solutions to this

23:07.600 --> 23:13.680
equation look like e to the mt times some initial condition, it means you can visualize what the

23:13.680 --> 23:19.920
matrix e to the mt does by letting every possible initial condition flow along this field for t

23:19.920 --> 23:30.000
units of time. The transition from start to finish is described by whatever matrix pops out from

23:30.000 --> 23:36.480
the computation for e to the mt. In our main example with the 90-degree rotation matrix,

23:36.480 --> 23:42.240
the vector field looks like this, and as we saw, e to the mt describes rotation in that case,

23:42.240 --> 23:48.640
which lines up with flow along this field. As another example, the more Shakespearean Romeo

23:48.640 --> 23:52.800
and Juliet might have equations that look a little more like this, where Juliet's rule

23:52.800 --> 23:57.520
is symmetric with Romeo's, and both of them are inclined to get carried away in response to one

23:57.520 --> 24:02.560
another's feelings. Again, the way the vector field you're looking at has been defined is to go

24:02.560 --> 24:08.960
to each point v in space and attach the vector m times v. This is the pictorial way of saying that

24:08.960 --> 24:16.080
the rate of change of a state must always equal m times itself. But for this example, flow along

24:16.080 --> 24:21.200
the field looks a lot different from how it did before. If Romeo and Juliet start off anywhere

24:21.200 --> 24:25.680
in this upper right half of the plane, their feelings will feed off of each other and they

24:25.680 --> 24:33.680
both tend towards infinity. If they're in the other half of the plane, well, let's just say

24:33.680 --> 24:38.880
that they stay more true to their Capulet and Montague family traditions. So even before you

24:38.880 --> 24:43.760
try calculating the exponential of this particular matrix, you can already have an intuitive sense

24:43.760 --> 24:48.960
for what the answer should look like. The resulting matrix should describe the transition from time

24:48.960 --> 24:54.560
zero to time t, which, if you look at the field, seems to indicate that it will squish along one

24:54.560 --> 25:01.520
diagonal while stretching along another, getting more extreme as t gets larger. Of course, all of

25:01.520 --> 25:06.640
this is presuming that e to the mt times an initial condition actually solves these systems.

25:07.360 --> 25:11.040
This is one of those facts that's easiest to believe when you just work it out yourself.

25:12.320 --> 25:17.920
But I'll run through a quick rough sketch. Write out the full polynomial that defines

25:17.920 --> 25:22.080
e to the mt and multiply by some initial condition vector on the right.

25:25.520 --> 25:31.920
And then take the derivative of this with respect to t. Because the matrix m is a constant,

25:31.920 --> 25:34.640
this just means applying the power rule to each one of the terms.

25:43.520 --> 25:47.040
And that power rule really nicely cancels out with the factorial terms.

25:47.280 --> 25:58.080
So what we're left with is an expression that looks almost identical to what we had before,

25:58.080 --> 26:02.880
except that each term has an extra m hanging onto it. But this can be factored out to the left.

26:03.600 --> 26:09.840
So the derivative of the expression is m times the original expression, and hence it solves the

26:09.840 --> 26:15.360
equation. This actually sweeps under the rug some details required for rigor, mostly centered

26:15.360 --> 26:19.760
around the question of whether or not this thing actually converges, but it does give the main idea.

26:20.880 --> 26:25.120
In the next chapter I would like to talk more about the properties that this operation has,

26:25.120 --> 26:30.080
most notably its relationship with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which leads us to more concrete

26:30.080 --> 26:34.720
ways of thinking about how you actually carry out this computation, which otherwise seems insane.

26:35.920 --> 26:40.160
Also, time permitting, it might be fun to talk about what it means to raise e to the power of

26:40.160 --> 26:42.160
the derivative operator.
