0	5800	What you are looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication, or rather
5800	10560	you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion happening on a four-dimensional
10560	16040	sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space, one which you'll understand by the
16040	22080	end of this video.
22080	26240	Quaternions are an absolutely fascinating and often underappreciated number system from
26240	27440	math.
27440	32000	Just as complex numbers are a two-dimensional extension of the real numbers, quaternions
32000	35520	are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers.
35520	39640	But they're not just playful mathematical shenanigans, they have a surprisingly pragmatic
39640	45120	utility for describing rotation in three dimensions, and even for quantum mechanics.
45120	48240	The story of their discovery is also quite famous in math.
48240	52640	The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton spent much of his life seeking a three-dimensional
52640	56000	number system, analogous to the complex numbers.
56000	59520	And as the story goes, his son would ask him every morning whether or not he had figured
59520	63400	out how to divide triples, and he would always say, no, not yet.
63400	68960	But on October 16th, 1843, while crossing the Broome Bridge in Dublin, he realized with
68960	73360	a supposed flash of insight that what he needed was not to add a single dimension to the complex
73360	79720	numbers, but to add two more imaginary dimensions, three imaginary dimensions describing space
79720	84120	and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in some kind of fourth dimension.
84120	88440	He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge,
88440	92280	which today bears a plaque in his honor showing that equation.
92280	96520	Now you have to understand, our modern notion of vectors with their dot product and the
96520	100920	cross product and things like that didn't really exist in Hamilton's time, at least
100920	102880	not in a standardized form.
102880	107840	So after his discovery, he pushed hard for quaternions to be the primary language with
107840	112440	which we teach students to describe three-dimensional space, even forming an official quaternion
112440	114920	society to proselytize his discovery.
114920	119520	Now, unfortunately, this was balanced with mathematicians on the other side of the fence,
119520	124440	who believed that the confusing notion of quaternion multiplication was not necessary for describing
124440	129200	three dimensions, resulting in some truly hilarious, old-timey trash talk legitimately
129200	130360	calling them evil.
130360	134480	It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene from Alice in Wonderland, whose author you
134480	139160	may know was an Oxford mathematician, was written in reference to quaternions, that
139160	143680	the chaotic table placement changes were mocking their multiplication, and that certain quotes
143680	147120	were referencing their non-commutative nature.
147120	151480	Fast forward about a century, and the computing industry gave quaternions a resurgence among
151480	157080	programmers who work with graphics and robotics and anything involving orientation in 3D space.
157080	162240	And this is because they give an elegant way to describe and compute 3D rotations, which
162240	166320	is computationally more efficient than other methods, and which also avoids a lot of the
166320	169280	numerical errors that arise in these other methods.
169280	173880	The 20th century also brought quaternions some more love from a completely different direction,
173880	174880	quantum mechanics.
174880	179680	You see, the special actions that quaternions describe in four dimensions are actually quite
179680	183880	relevant to the way that two-state systems, like spin of an electron or the polarization
183880	187680	of a photon, are described mathematically.
187680	191960	What I'll show you here is a way to visualize quaternions in their full four-dimensional
191960	192960	glory.
192960	196800	I would surprise me if this approach was fully original, but I can say that it's certainly
196800	201480	not the standard way to teach quaternions, and that the specific four-dimensional right-hand
201480	206240	rule image that I'd like to build up to is something that I haven't really seen elsewhere.
206240	209800	Building up an understanding for this visual will take us meaningful time, but once you
209800	214280	have it, there is a very natural and satisfying intuition for how to think about quaternion
214280	215780	multiplication.
215780	220160	It won't be until the next video that I show you how exactly quaternions describe orientation
220160	224240	in three dimensions, which is, for some people, the whole reason we care about it, but once
224240	228760	we're able to go at it armed with the image of what they're doing to a 4D hypersphere,
228760	232920	there's a pleasing understanding to be had for the otherwise opaque formulas characterizing
232920	235480	this relationship.
235480	239980	The structure here will be to start by imagining teaching complex numbers to someone who only
239980	244720	understands one dimension, then describing 3D rotations to someone who only understands
244720	250040	two dimensions, and ultimately to represent what quaternions are doing up in four dimensions
250040	257520	within the constraints of our 3D space.
257520	262160	Our first character is Linus the Linedlander, whose mind can only grasp the one-dimensional
262160	264960	geometry of lines in the algebra of real numbers.
264960	269240	We're going to try to describe complex numbers to Linus, and it's really important for you
269240	273280	to empathize with him as much as you can during this, because in a few minutes, you're going
273280	274960	to be in his shoes.
274960	278760	On the one hand, you could define complex numbers purely algebraically.
278760	283480	You say each one is expressed as some real number plus some other real number times i,
283480	288120	where i is a newly invented constant whose defining property is that i times i equals
288120	289520	negative one.
289520	294160	Then you say to Linus, to multiply two complex numbers, you just use the distributive property,
294160	301480	what many people learn in school as foil, and you apply this rule that i times i equals
301480	304440	negative one to simplify things down further.
304440	308440	And that's fine, that totally works, and the standard textbook way to introduce quaternions
308440	312440	is analogous to this, showing the algebraic rules and calling it done.
312440	316240	But I think something is missing if we don't at least try to show Linus the geometry of
316240	320760	complex numbers, and what complex multiplication looks like, since the problems in math and
320760	326320	physics where complex numbers are shockingly useful often leverage this spatial intuition.
326320	329800	You and I, who understand two dimensions, might think of it like this.
329800	335120	When you multiply two complex numbers, z times w, you can think of z as a sort of function
335120	340000	acting on w, rotating and stretching it in some way.
340000	343800	I like to think of this by broadening the view and asking, what does z do to the entire
343800	344800	plane?
344800	348280	And you can think of that bird's eye view action by imagining using one hand to fix
348280	353880	the number zero in place, and using another hand to drag the point at one up to z, since
353880	358200	anything times zero is zero, and anything times one is itself.
358200	362120	And in two dimensions, there is one and only one stretching rotating action on the plane
362120	363600	that'll do this.
363600	367360	This is also how I'll have you thinking about quaternion multiplication later on, where
367360	371240	the number on the left acts as a kind of function to the one on the right.
371240	375760	And we'll understand this function by seeing how it acts by transforming space, although
375760	383320	instead of rotating 2D space, it does a sort of double rotation in 4D space.
383320	386920	By the way, if you want to review thinking about complex numbers as a kind of action,
386920	390720	a good warm up for this video might be the one I did on e to the pi i explained with
390720	392800	introductory group theory.
392800	396480	The Linus the Linelander is pretty comfortable with the idea of stretching, that's what
396480	399160	multiplication by real numbers looks like.
399160	402520	Maybe it's a little weird for him to think about stretching in multiple dimensions, but
402520	404520	it's not fundamentally different.
404520	409960	The difficult thing to communicate to Linus is rotation, specifically focus on the unit
409960	415080	circle of the complex plane, all the numbers a distance one from zero, since multiplication
415080	418320	by these numbers corresponds to pure rotation.
418320	424920	How would you explain to Linus the look and the feel of multiplying by these numbers?
424920	429200	At first, that might seem impossible, I mean rotation is just such an intrinsically two
429200	435920	dimensional idea, but on the other hand, rotation involves only one degree of freedom, a single
435920	440240	number, the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely.
440240	444880	So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all rotations to the
444880	448640	one dimensional continuum that is Linus's world.
448640	451760	And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you is what's
451760	456720	called a stereographic projection, it's a special way to map a circle onto a line, or
456720	466280	a sphere into a plane, or even a 4D hypersphere into 3D space.
466280	471720	For every point on the unit circle, draw a line from negative one through that point,
471720	475720	and wherever it intersects the vertical line through the circle center, that's where the
475720	479640	point of the circle gets projected.
479640	485520	So for example, the point at one gets projected into the center of the line, the point i actually
485520	490760	stays fixed in place, as does negative i.
490760	496200	All of the points on that 90 degree arc between one and i will get projected somewhere in
496200	501560	the interval between where one landed and where i landed, as you continue farther around
502400	506400	the circle on the arc between i and negative one, the projected points end up farther
506400	508760	and farther away at an increasing rate.
508760	513120	Similarly, if you come around the other way towards negative one, the projected points
513120	516760	end up farther and farther on the other end of the line.
516760	521360	This line of projected points is what we show to Linus, labeling a few key points, like
521360	524800	one and i and negative one all for reference.
524800	529280	Technically, the point at negative one has no projection under this map, since the tangent
529320	532960	line to the circle at that point never crosses the vertical line.
532960	537000	But what we say is that negative one ends up at the point at infinity.
537000	540720	This is a special point you imagine adding to the line, where you would approach it,
540720	544880	if you walk infinitely far along the line in either direction.
544880	549040	Now it's important to remember, and to remind Linus, that what he's seeing is only the
549040	553520	complex numbers that are a distance one from the origin, the unit circle.
553520	559000	Linus doesn't see most numbers, like zero, or one plus i, or negative two minus i, but
559000	563720	that's okay, because right now we just want to describe complex numbers z, where multiplying
563720	571200	by z has the effect of a pure rotation, so he only needs to understand the unit circle.
571200	576560	For example, when we take the number i and multiply it by any other complex number w,
576560	580440	the effect is to rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.
580440	584800	And when we apply this action to the circle, being projected down to the line for Linus,
584800	585800	what does he see?
585800	590660	Well, it's a bit of a strange morphing action on the line, one which I want you to become
590660	593520	familiar with for something we'll see later on.
593520	597240	It's easiest to understand by following a few key reference points.
597240	604000	i times one is i, so that means the number one should move up to i.
604000	611480	i times i is negative one, so the point at i slides off to infinity.
611480	616200	i times negative one is equal to negative i, so that point at infinity kind of comes
616200	620360	back around from the bottom to the position one unit below the center.
620360	626520	And i times negative i is one, so that point at negative i slides up to one.
626520	629960	Even though this is kind of a weird motion, it lets us communicate some important ideas
629960	631160	to Linus.
631160	635840	For example, multiplying by i four times, which corresponds to rotating by 90 degrees
635840	639160	four times in a row, gets us back to where we started.
639160	640800	i to the fourth equals one.
640800	645080	Here, to get more of a feel for things, let me just show the circle rotated at various
645080	646080	different angles.
646080	650240	On both the left and the right half of the screen here, I'm putting a hand on the point
650240	655000	that started at the number one to help us and to help Linus keep track of the overall
655000	666920	motion.
666920	672040	Next let's introduce Felix the Flatlander, who only understands two-dimensional geometry.
672040	678280	Imagine trying to explain rotations of a sphere to Felix.
678280	682000	In the spirit of transitioning from complex numbers to quaternions, let's extend the
682000	686560	complex numbers with its horizontal axis of real numbers and its vertical axis of imaginary
686560	692240	numbers with a third axis, defined by some newly invented constant, J, sitting one unit
692240	696000	away from zero, perpendicular to the complex plane.
696000	699840	Instead of having this new axis in the z direction, like you might expect, for a better
699840	704840	analogy with how we'll visualize quaternions, we'll want to orient things so that the i
704840	710880	and the j axes sit in the x and the y directions, with the real number line aligned along the
710880	713600	z direction.
713600	718600	So every point in 3D space is described as some real number plus some real number times
718600	721800	i plus some real number times j.
721800	725960	As it happens, it's not possible to define a notion of multiplication for a 3D number
725960	730440	system like this that would satisfy the usual algebraic properties that make multiplication
730440	731940	a useful construct.
731940	735720	Perhaps I'll outline why this is the case in a follow-on video, but staying focused
735720	740880	on our current goal, think about describing 3D rotations in this coordinate system to
740880	742880	Felix the Flatlander.
742880	747080	The unit sphere consists of all those numbers which are a distance one from zero at the
747080	755320	origin, meaning the sum of the squares of their coordinates is one.
755320	760400	We can't show all of 3D space to Felix, but what we can do is project this 2D surface
760400	766200	to him and give him a feel for what reorientations of this sphere look like under that projection.
766200	770880	Analogous to what we did before, stereographic projection will associate almost every point
770880	775960	on the unit sphere with a unique point on the horizontal plane defined by the i and
775960	777600	the j axes.
777600	782160	For each point on the sphere, draw a line from negative one at the south pole through
782160	792520	that point and see where it intersects the plane.
792520	796240	So the point one at the north pole ends up at the center of the plane.
796240	800560	All of the points of the northern hemisphere get mapped somewhere inside the unit circle
800560	806120	of the i, j plane, and that unit circle, which passes through i, j, negative i, negative
806120	808960	j, actually stays fixed in place.
808960	811320	And that's an important point to make note of.
811320	815240	Even though most points and lines and patches that Felix the Flatlander sees are going to
815240	819960	be warped projections of the real sphere, this unit circle is the one thing that he
819960	827560	has which is an honest part of our unit sphere, unaltered by projection.
827560	831800	All of the points in the southern hemisphere get projected outside that unit circle, each
831800	836480	getting farther and farther away as you approach negative one at the south pole.
836480	840800	And again, negative one has no projection under this mapping, but what we say is that
840800	843620	it ends up at some point at infinity.
843620	847280	That point at infinity is something such that no matter which direction you walk on the
847280	851600	plane, as you go infinitely far out, you'll be approaching that point.
851600	855640	It's analogous to how if you walk any direction away from the north pole, you're approaching
855640	859280	the south pole.
859280	863000	Now let me just pull up a view of what Felix sees in two dimensions.
863000	868200	As I rotate the sphere in various ways, the lines of latitude and longitude drawn on that
868200	873160	sphere get projected into various circles and lines in Felix's space.
873160	875960	And the way I've done things up here, the checkerboard pattern on the surface of the
875960	880520	sphere is accurately reflected in the projected view that you see with Felix.
880520	885600	And the pink dot represents where the point that started at the north pole ends up after
885600	888120	the rotation.
888120	893120	And that yellow circle represents where the equator ended up after the projection.
893120	896800	The more you put yourself in Felix's shoes right now, the easier quaternions will be
896800	898000	in a moment.
898000	901720	And as with Linus, it helps to focus on a few key reference objects rather than trying
901720	903720	to see the whole sphere.
903720	909320	This circle, passing through one, i, negative one, and negative i, gets mapped onto a line
909320	912640	which Felix sees as the horizontal axis.
912640	916560	It's important to remind Felix that what he sees is not the same thing as the i-axis.
916560	921040	Remember, we're only projecting the numbers that have a distance one from the origin.
921040	926840	So most points on the actual i-axis, like zero and two i and three i, etc., are completely
926840	929640	invisible to Felix.
929640	935840	Similarly, the circle that passes through one, j, negative one, and negative j gets projected
935840	938840	onto what he sees as a vertical line.
938840	943840	And in general, any line that Felix sees comes from some circle on the sphere that
943840	945920	passes through negative one.
945920	955600	In some sense, a line is just a circle that passes through the pointed infinity.
955600	958800	Now think about what Felix sees as we rotate the sphere.
958800	964920	A 90-degree rotation about the j-axis brings one to i, i to negative one, negative one
964920	968080	to negative i, and negative i to one.
968080	972720	Also what Felix the Flatlander sees is an extension of the rotation that Linus the
972720	974880	Linelander was seeing.
974880	980240	Notice also that this action rotates the i, j unit circle to the position where the one
980240	982480	j unit circle used to be.
982480	987960	So what Felix sees is his yellow unit circle getting transformed into a vertical line while
987960	992200	that red vertical line gets transformed into the unit circle.
992200	995720	Of course, from our perspective, we know this is all just rigid motion.
995720	998440	No actual stretching or morphing is taking place.
998440	1001680	All of that is just an artifact of the projection.
1001680	1008600	Similarly, a rotation about the i-axis involves moving one to j, j to negative one, negative
1008600	1011600	one to negative j, and negative j to one.
1011600	1017640	This rotation turns the i, j unit circle into the one i unit circle, which to Felix looks
1017640	1029480	like the unit circle getting transformed into a horizontal line.
1029480	1033920	A rotation about the real axis is actually quite easy for Felix to understand, since
1033920	1037880	the whole projection simply gets rotated about the origin, where the only points staying
1037880	1049280	fixed in place are one at the origin and negative one off at infinity.
1049280	1053640	In the same way that the complex numbers included the real numbers with a single extra quote
1053640	1059200	unquote imaginary dimension represented by the unit i, and that the not actually a number
1059200	1065240	system thing we had in three dimensions included a second imaginary direction, j, the quaternions
1065240	1069920	include the real numbers together with three separate imaginary dimensions represented by
1069920	1072720	the units i, j, and k.
1072720	1077280	Each of these three imaginary dimensions is perpendicular to the real number line and
1077280	1081920	they're all perpendicular to each other somehow.
1081920	1086600	So in the same way that complex numbers are represented as a pair of real numbers, each
1086600	1092200	quaternion can be written using four real numbers and it lives in four dimensional space.
1092200	1097080	You often think of this as being broken up into a real or scalar part and then a 3D imaginary
1097080	1098080	part.
1098080	1103440	And Hamilton used a special word for quaternions that had no real part and just i, j, k components,
1103440	1109000	a word which was previously somewhat foreign in the lingo of math and physics, vector.
1109000	1113560	On the one hand, you could just define quaternion multiplication by giving the rules for how
1113560	1118840	i, j, and k multiply together and saying that everything must distribute nicely.
1118840	1123800	This is analogous to defining complex multiplication by saying that i times i is negative one and
1123800	1126320	then distributing and simplifying products.
1126320	1130960	And indeed, this is how you would tell a computer to perform quaternion multiplication and the
1130960	1135920	relative compactness of this operation compared to say matrix multiplication is what's made
1135920	1139400	quaternion so useful for graphics programming and many other things.
1139400	1143440	There's also a rather elegant form of this multiplication rule written in terms of the
1143440	1148200	dot product and the cross product and in some sense, quaternion multiplication subsumes
1148200	1152640	both of these notions, at least as they appear in three dimensions.
1152640	1156600	But just as a deeper understanding for complex multiplication comes from understanding its
1156600	1161760	geometry that multiplying by a complex number involves a combination of scaling and rotating,
1161760	1166180	you and I are here for the four-dimensional geometry of quaternion multiplication.
1166180	1170560	And just as the magnitude of a complex number, its distance from zero, is the square root
1170560	1174880	of the sum of the squares of its component, that same operation gives you the magnitude
1174880	1178480	of a quaternion.
1178480	1185640	And multiplying one quaternion, q1, by another, q2, has the effect of scaling q2 by the magnitude
1185640	1191080	of q1 followed by a very special type of rotation in four dimensions.
1191080	1195640	And those special 4D rotations, the heart of what we need to understand, correspond
1195640	1200640	to the hypersphere of quaternions, a distance one from the origin, both in the sense that
1200640	1206600	the quaternions whose multiplying action is a pure rotation live on that hypersphere,
1206600	1210560	and in the sense that we can understand this weird 4D action just by following points on
1210560	1214680	the hypersphere, rather than trying to look at all of the points in the inconceivable
1214680	1217240	stretches of four-dimensional space.
1217240	1222160	Analogous to what we did for Linus and Felix, we stereographically project this hypersphere
1222160	1227680	into 3D space.
1227680	1232280	This label in the upper right is going to show a given unit quaternion, and this little
1232280	1238760	pink dot will show where that particular quaternion gets projected in our 3D space.
1238760	1242640	Just as before, we're projecting from the number negative one, which sits on the real
1242640	1248560	number line that is somehow perpendicular to all of our 3D space and beyond our perception.
1248560	1253900	Just as before, the number one ends up projected straight into the center of our space.
1253900	1258340	And in the same way that i and negative i were fixed in place for Linus, and that the
1258340	1264820	i,j unit circle was fixed in place for Felix, we get a whole sphere passing through i,j
1264820	1269940	and k on that unit hypersphere, which stays in place under the projection.
1269940	1275260	So what we see as a unit sphere in our 3D space represents the only unaltered part of
1275260	1279180	the hypersphere of quaternions getting projected down onto us.
1279180	1283300	It's something analogous to the equator of a 3D sphere, and it represents all of the
1283300	1288260	unit quaternions whose real part is zero, what Hamilton would have described as unit
1288260	1292180	vectors.
1292180	1297460	The unit quaternions with positive real parts, between zero and one, end up somewhere inside
1297460	1301900	this unit sphere, closer to the number one in our 3D space, which should feel analogous
1301900	1307540	to how the northern hemisphere got mapped inside the unit circle for Felix.
1307540	1311460	On the other hand, all the unit quaternions with negative real part end up somewhere
1311460	1320500	outside that unit sphere.
1320500	1324140	The number negative one is sitting off at the pointed infinity, which you can easily
1324140	1327060	find by walking in any direction.
1327060	1330980	Keep in mind, even though we see the projection of some of these quaternions as being closer
1330980	1335340	or farther from the origin of our 3D space, everything you're looking at represents a
1335340	1340300	unit quaternion, so everything you're looking at really has the same magnitude, the same
1340300	1342580	distance from the number zero.
1342580	1346260	And that number zero itself is nowhere to be found in this picture.
1346260	1350960	Like all other non-unit quaternions, it's invisible to us.
1350960	1354780	In the same way that for Felix, the circle passing through one, i, negative one, and
1354780	1360700	negative i got projected into a line through the origin.
1360700	1365420	When we see this line through the origin passing through i and negative i, we should understand
1365420	1367740	that it really represents a circle.
1367860	1372820	Likewise, up on the hypersphere, invisible to us, there is a unit sphere passing through
1372820	1377140	one, i, j, negative one, negative i, and negative j.
1377140	1381940	And that whole sphere gets projected into the plane that we see passing through one,
1381940	1386740	i, negative i, j, negative j, and negative one, off at infinity, what you and I might
1386740	1388660	call the xy plane.
1388660	1393900	In general, any plane that you see here really represents the projection of a sphere somewhere
1393900	1397580	up on the hypersphere, which passes through the number negative one.
1399580	1404300	Now the action of taking a unit quaternion and multiplying it by any other quaternion
1404300	1409980	from the left can be thought of in terms of two separate 2D rotations happening perpendicular
1409980	1415540	to and in sync with each other in a way that could only ever be possible in four dimensions.
1415540	1418900	As a first example, let's look at multiplication by i.
1418900	1423300	We already know what this does to the circle that passes through one and i, which we see
1423300	1426060	as a line.
1426060	1433420	One goes to i, i goes to negative one, off at infinity, negative one comes back around
1433420	1436620	to negative i, and negative i goes to one.
1436620	1440900	Remember, just like what line is saw, all of this is the stereographic projection of
1440900	1443260	a 90 degree rotation.
1443260	1448100	Now look at the circle passing through j and k, which is in a sense perpendicular to the
1448100	1450460	circle passing through one and i.
1450460	1454180	Now it might feel weird to talk about two circles being perpendicular to each other,
1454180	1457340	especially when they have the same center, the same radius, and they don't touch each
1457340	1461780	other at all, but nothing could be more natural in four dimensions.
1461780	1467500	You can think of the action of i on this perpendicular circle as obeying a certain right hand rule.
1467500	1471740	If you'll excuse the intrusion of my ghostly green screen hand into our otherwise pristine
1471740	1476180	platonic mathematical stage, you let that thumb of your right hand point from the number
1476180	1479500	one to i and you curl your fingers.
1479500	1483780	The jk circle will rotate in the direction of that curl.
1483780	1484780	How much?
1484780	1490780	Well, by the same amount as the one i circle rotates, which is 90 degrees in this case.
1490780	1496100	This is what I meant by two rotations perpendicular to and in sync with each other.
1496100	1508100	So j goes to k, k goes to negative j, negative j goes to negative k, and negative k goes
1508100	1511240	to j.
1511240	1515620	This gives us a little table for what the number i does to the other quaternions.
1515620	1518860	But I want this not to be something that you memorize, but something that you could close
1518860	1521260	your eyes and you could really see.
1521260	1527020	Computationally, if you know what a quaternion does to the numbers one, i, j, and k, you
1527020	1532300	know what it does to any arbitrary quaternion, since multiplication distributes nicely.
1532300	1537860	In the language of linear algebra, one, i, j, and k form a basis of our four-dimensional
1537860	1542860	space, so knowing what our transformation does to them gives us the full information about
1542860	1545060	what it does to all of space.
1545060	1549500	Geometrically, a four-dimensional creature would be able to look at those two perpendicular
1549500	1554900	rotations that I just described and understand that they lock you into one and only one rigid
1554900	1556820	motion for the hypersphere.
1556820	1562100	We might lack the intuitions of such a hypothetical creature, but we can maybe try to get close.
1562100	1567380	Here's what the action of repeatedly multiplying by i looks like on our stereographic projection
1567380	1569900	of the i, j, k sphere.
1569900	1574100	It gets rotated into what we see as a plane, then gets rotated further back to where it
1574100	1579340	used to be, though the orientation is all reversed now, then it gets rotated again into
1579340	1585260	what we see as a plane, and after the fourth iteration it ends up right back where it started.
1585260	1589540	As another example, think of a quaternion like q equals negative square root of two
1589540	1594300	over two plus square root of two over two times i, which, if we pull up a picture of
1594300	1601380	a complex plane, is a 135 degree rotation away from one in the direction of i.
1601380	1606260	Under our projection, we see this along the line from one to i somewhere outside the unit
1606260	1607340	sphere.
1607340	1611740	If that sounds weird, just remember how Linus would have seen this same number.
1611740	1616980	The action of multiplying this q by all other quaternions will look to us like dragging the
1616980	1622900	point at one all the way to this projected version of q, while the jk circle gets rotated
1622900	1630580	135 degrees, according to our right hand rule.
1630580	1633780	Multiplication by any other quaternion is completely similar.
1633780	1637920	For example, let's see what it looks like for j to act on other quaternions by multiplication
1637920	1639420	from the left.
1639420	1644700	The circle, through one and j, which we see projected as a line through the origin, gets
1644700	1648180	rotated 90 degrees, dragging one up to j.
1648180	1658540	So j times one is one, and j times j is negative one.
1658540	1664420	The circle perpendicular to that one, passing through i and k, gets rotated 90 degrees,
1664420	1668740	according to this right hand rule, where you point your thumb from one to j.
1668740	1682180	So j times i is negative k, and j times k is i.
1682180	1686900	In general, for any other unit quaternion you see somewhere in space, start by drawing
1686900	1692060	the unit circle passing through one, q, and negative one, which we see in our projection
1692060	1694420	as a line through the origin.
1694420	1698980	Then draw the circle perpendicular to that one on what we see as the unit sphere.
1698980	1704180	You rotate the first circle so that one ends up where q was, and rotate the perpendicular
1704180	1720600	circle by the same amount according to the right hand rule.
1720600	1724260	One thing worth noticing here is that order of multiplication matters.
1724260	1727420	It's not, as mathematicians would say, commutative.
1727420	1732580	For example, i times j is k, which you might think of in terms of i acting on the quaternion
1732580	1734980	j, rotating it up to k.
1734980	1741780	But if you think of j as acting on i, j times i, it rotates i to negative k.
1741780	1746400	In fact, commutativity, this ability to swap the order of multiplication, is a way more
1746400	1749260	special property than a lot of people realize.
1749260	1752940	And most groups of actions on some space don't have it.
1752940	1756900	Things like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot.
1756900	1761860	Or how rotating a cube about the z-axis and then about the x-axis gives a different final
1761860	1769420	state from rotating it about the x-axis then about the z-axis.
1769420	1773580	And last, as one final but rather important point, so far I've shown you how to think
1773580	1778860	about quaternions as acting by left multiplication, where when you read an expression like i times
1778860	1784020	j, you think of i as a kind of function morphing all of space, and j is just one of the points
1784020	1785020	that it's acting on.
1785020	1790380	But you can also think of them as a different sort of action, by multiplying from the right,
1790380	1793780	where in this expression, j would be acting on i.
1793780	1797060	In that case, the rule for multiplication is very similar.
1797060	1801420	It's still the case that 1 goes to j and j goes to negative 1, etc.
1801420	1806340	But instead of applying the right hand rule to the circle perpendicular to the 1j circle,
1806340	1808180	you would use your left hand.
1808180	1812820	So either way, i times j is equal to k, but you can either think about this with your
1812820	1818980	right hand curling the number j to the number k, as your thumb points from 1 to i, or as
1818980	1825460	your left hand curling i to k, as its thumb points from 1 to j.
1825460	1830180	Understanding this left hand rule for multiplication from the other side will be extremely useful
1830180	1835700	for understanding how unit quaternions describe rotation in three dimensions.
1835700	1840700	And so far, it's probably not clear how exactly quaternions do describe 3D rotation.
1840700	1845420	I mean, if you consider one of these actions on the unit sphere, passing through i, j, and
1845420	1849980	k, it doesn't leave that sphere in place, it morphs it out of position, so the way that
1849980	1854140	this works is slightly more complicated than a single quaternion product.
1854140	1857940	It involves a process called conjugation, and I'll make a full follow on video all
1857940	1862140	about it so that we have the time to go through some examples.
1862140	1865820	In the meantime, for more information on the story of quaternions and their relation
1865820	1871260	to orientation in 3D space, Quanta, a mathematical publication I'm sure a lot of you are familiar
1871260	1877220	with, just put out a post in a kind of loose conjunction with this video, link in the description.
1877220	1881220	If you enjoyed this, consider sharing it with some friends, and if you felt like the narrative
1881220	1886020	structure here was actually helpful for understanding, maybe reassure those friends who would be
1886020	1890620	turned off by a large time stamp that good math is actually worth the time.
1890620	1894660	And many thanks to the patrons among you, I actually spent way longer than I care to
1894660	1899140	admit on this project, so your patience and support is especially appreciated this time
1899140	1899580	around.
