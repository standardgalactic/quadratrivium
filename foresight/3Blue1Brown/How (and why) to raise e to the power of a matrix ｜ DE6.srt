00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Let me pull out an old differential equations textbook that I learned from in college,

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,520
and let's turn to this funny little exercise in here that asks the reader to compute e to the power

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:15,600
at, where a, we're told, is going to be a matrix, and the insinuation seems to be that the results

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,120
will also be a matrix. It then offers several examples for what you might plug in for a.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,560
Now, taking out a context, putting a matrix into an exponent like this probably seems like total

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,760
nonsense, but what it refers to is an extremely beautiful operation, and the reason it shows up

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,480
in this book is that it's useful. It's used to solve a very important class of differential

8
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,440
equations. In turn, given that the universe is often written in the language of differential

9
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,400
equations, you see this pop up in physics all the time too, especially in quantum mechanics,

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,120
where matrix exponents are littered throughout the place. They play a particularly prominent role.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,720
This has a lot to do with Schrodinger's equation, which we'll touch on a bit later,

12
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,440
and it may also help in understanding your romantic relationships, but again, all in due time.

13
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,680
A big part of the reason I want to cover this topic is that there is an extremely nice way to

14
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,800
visualize what matrix exponents are actually doing using flow that not a lot of people seem to talk

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,240
about. But for the bulk of this chapter, let's start by laying out what exactly the operation is,

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,520
and see if we can get a feel for what kinds of problems it helps us to solve.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,320
The first thing you should know is that this is not some bizarre way to multiply the constant

18
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,000
e by itself multiple times. You would be right to call that nonsense. The actual definition

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,320
is related to a certain infinite polynomial for describing real number powers of e,

20
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,200
what we call its Taylor series. For example, if I took the number two and plugged it into this

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,360
polynomial, then as you add more and more terms, each of which looks like some power of two divided

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:02:01,120
by some factorial. The sum approaches a number near 7.389, and this number is precisely e times e.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,040
If you increment this input by one, then somewhat miraculously, no matter where you started from,

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,040
the effect on the output is always to multiply it by another factor of e.

25
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
For reasons that you're going to see in a bit, mathematicians became interested in plugging

26
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
all kinds of things into this polynomial, things like complex numbers, and for our purposes today,

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,680
matrices, even when those objects do not immediately make sense as exponents.

28
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,120
What some authors do is give this infinite polynomial the name exp when you plug in more

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,400
exotic inputs. It's a gentle nod to the connection that this has to exponential functions in the

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,240
case of real numbers, even though obviously these inputs don't make sense as exponents.

31
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,000
However, an equally common convention is to give a much less gentle nod to the connection and just

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,320
abbreviate the whole thing as e to the power of whatever object you're plugging in,

33
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,400
whether that's a complex number or a matrix, or all sorts of more exotic objects.

34
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,160
So while this equation is a theorem for real numbers, it's a definition for more exotic inputs.

35
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,840
Cynically, you could call this a blatant abuse of notation.

36
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,720
More charitably, you might view it as an example of the beautiful cycle between discovery and

37
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
invention in math. In either case, plugging in a matrix even to a polynomial might seem a little

38
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,440
strange, so let's be clear on what we mean here. The matrix has to have the same number of rows and

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,200
columns. That way, you can multiply it by itself according to the usual rules of matrix multiplication.

40
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,960
This is what we mean by squaring it. Similarly, if you were to take that result and then multiply

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,680
it by the original matrix again, this is what we mean by cubing the matrix.

42
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,320
If you carry on like this, you can take any whole number power of a matrix. It's perfectly

43
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:47,440
sensible. In this context, powers still mean exactly what you would expect, repeated multiplication.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,240
Each term in this polynomial is scaled by one divided by some factorial,

45
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,240
and with matrices, all that means is that you multiply each component by that number.

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
Likewise, it always makes sense to add together two matrices. This is something that you again

47
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,280
do term by term. The astute among you might ask how sensible it is to take this out to infinity,

48
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,200
which would be a great question, one that I'm largely going to postpone the answer to,

49
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,720
but I can show you one pretty fun example here now. Take this 2 by 2 matrix that has negative

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,240
pi and pi sitting off its diagonal entries. Let's see what the sum gives. The first term

51
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,640
is the identity matrix. This is actually what we mean by definition when we raise a matrix to

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,720
the zeroth power. Then we add the matrix itself, which gives us the pi off the diagonal terms,

53
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,680
and then add half of the matrix squared. And continuing on, I'll have the computer keep

54
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,720
adding more and more terms, each of which requires taking one more matrix product to get the new power

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,480
and then adding it to a running tally. And as it keeps going, it seems to be approaching a stable

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:00,160
value, which is around negative one times the identity matrix. In this sense, we say the infinite

57
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,440
sum equals that negative identity. By the end of this video, my hope is that this particular

58
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,400
fact comes to make total sense to you. For any of you familiar with Euler's famous identity,

59
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,440
this is essentially the matrix version of that. It turns out that in general, no matter what

60
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,040
matrix you start with, as you add more and more terms, you eventually approach some stable value,

61
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,680
though sometimes it can take quite a while before you get there.

62
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,960
Just seeing the definition like this in isolation raises all kinds of questions. Most notably,

63
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,200
why would mathematicians and physicists be interested in torturing their poor matrices this

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,240
way? What problems are they trying to solve? And if you're anything like me, a new operation is

65
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,680
only satisfying when you have a clear view of what it's trying to do, some sense of how to predict

66
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,400
the output based on the input before you actually crunch the numbers. How on earth could you have

67
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,680
predicted that the matrix with pi off the diagonals results in a negative identity matrix like this?

68
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,120
Often in math, you should view the definition not as a starting point, but as a target.

69
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,240
Contrary to the structure of textbooks, mathematicians do not start by making definitions

70
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,800
and enlisting a lot of theorems and proving them and then showing some examples. The process of

71
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,080
discovering math typically goes the other way around. They start by chewing on specific problems

72
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,640
and then generalizing those problems, then coming up with constructs that might be helpful in those

73
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,080
general cases, and only then do you write down a new definition or extend an old one.

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,960
As to what sorts of specific examples might motivate matrix exponents,

75
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,640
two come to mind. One involving relationships and the other quantum mechanics. Let's start with

76
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:47,520
relationships. Suppose we have two lovers, let's call them Romeo and Juliet, and let's let X

77
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,320
represent Juliet's love for Romeo and Y represent his love for her, both of which are going to be

78
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,440
values that change with time. This is an example that we actually touched on in chapter one.

79
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,000
It's based on a Steven Strogett's article, but it's okay if you didn't see that. The way their

80
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,680
relationship works is that the rate at which Juliet's love for Romeo changes, the derivative of this

81
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,880
value, is equal to negative one times Romeo's love for her. So in other words, when Romeo is expressing

82
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:23,200
cool disinterest, that's when Juliet's feelings actually increase, whereas if he becomes too infatuated,

83
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,760
her interest will start to fade. Romeo, on the other hand, is the opposite. The rate of change of

84
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:35,840
his love is equal to the size of Juliet's love. So while Juliet is mad at him, his affections tend to

85
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,920
decrease. Whereas if she loves him, that's when his feelings grow. Of course, neither one of these

86
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:49,520
numbers is holding still. As Romeo's love increases in response to Juliet, her equation

87
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,920
continues to apply and drives her love down. Both of these equations always apply from each

88
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,120
infinitesimal point in time to the next, so every slight change to one value immediately

89
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,960
influences the rate of change of the other. This is a system of differential equations.

90
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,640
It's a puzzle where your challenge is to find explicit functions for X of t and Y of t that

91
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,920
make both of these expressions true. Now, as systems of differential equations go,

92
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,040
this one is on the simpler side. Enough so that many calculus students could probably just guess

93
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:28,160
at an answer. But keep in mind, it's not enough to find some pair of functions that makes this

94
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,680
true. If you want to actually predict where Romeo and Juliet end up after some starting point,

95
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,800
you have to make sure that your functions match the initial set of conditions at time t equals zero.

96
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:44,400
More to the point, our actual goal today is to systematically solve more general versions

97
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,880
of this equation without guessing and checking, and it's that question that leads us to matrix

98
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,400
exponents. Very often, when you have multiple changing values like this, it's helpful to

99
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,360
package them together as coordinates of a single point in a higher dimensional space. So for Romeo

100
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,240
and Juliet, think of their relationship as a point in a 2D space, the X-coordinate capturing

101
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:14,720
Juliet's feelings, and the Y-coordinate capturing Romeo's. Sometimes it's helpful to picture this

102
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,920
state as an arrow from the origin, other times just as a point. All that really matters is that it

103
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,840
encodes two numbers, and moving forward, we'll be writing that as a column vector. And of course,

104
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:30,800
this is all a function of time. You might picture the rate of change of this state,

105
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,080
the thing that packages together the derivative of X and the derivative of Y, as a kind of velocity

106
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,440
vector in this state space, something that tugs at our point in some direction and with some magnitude

107
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,800
that indicates how quickly it's changing. Remember, the rule here is that the rate of change of X

108
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:55,680
is negative Y, and the rate of change of Y is X. Set up as vectors like this, we could rewrite the

109
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,280
right-hand side of this equation as a product of this matrix with the original vector, X, Y.

110
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,960
The top row encodes Juliet's rule, and the bottom row encodes Romeo's rule. So what we have here

111
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,080
is a differential equation telling us that the rate of change of some vector is equal to a certain

112
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:22,400
matrix times itself. In a moment, we'll talk about how matrix exponentiation solves this kind of

113
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,440
equation. But before that, let me show you a simpler way that we can solve this particular system,

114
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,640
one that uses pure geometry, and it helps set the stage for visualizing matrix exponents a bit later.

115
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,280
This matrix from our system is a 90-degree rotation matrix.

116
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,480
For any of you rusty on how to think about matrices as transformations,

117
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,520
there's a video all about it on this channel, a series, really. The basic idea is that when

118
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:54,880
you multiply a matrix by the vector 1, 0, it pulls out the first column. And similarly,

119
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,280
if you multiply it by 0, 1, that pulls out the second column. What this means is that when you

120
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:06,960
look at a matrix, you can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors,

121
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:13,120
known as the basis vectors. The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling and adding

122
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,640
these two basis results by that vector's coordinates. So looking back at the matrix

123
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:23,680
from our system, notice how from its columns, we can tell it takes the first basis vector to 0, 1,

124
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,040
and the second to negative 1, 0, hence why I'm calling it the 90-degree rotation matrix.

125
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,880
What it means for our equation is that it's saying wherever Romeo and Juliet are in this state space,

126
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,920
their rate of change has to look like a 90-degree rotation of this position vector.

127
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,640
The only way velocity can permanently be perpendicular to position like this

128
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,280
is when you rotate around the origin in circular motion, never growing or shrinking because the

129
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,880
rate of change has no component in the direction of the position. More specifically, since the

130
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:05,360
length of this velocity vector equals the length of the position vector, then for each unit of time,

131
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,640
the distance that this covers is equal to one radius's worth of arc length along that circle.

132
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,760
In other words, it rotates at one radian per unit time, so in particular, it would take

133
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,560
two pi units of time to make a full revolution. If you want to describe this kind of rotation

134
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,360
with a formula, we can use a more general rotation matrix, which looks like this.

135
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,400
Again, we can read it in terms of the columns. Notice how the first column tells us that it

136
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:41,360
takes that first basis vector to cosine of t, sine of t, and the second column tells us that

137
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,720
it takes the second basis vector to negative sine of t, cosine of t, both of which are consistent

138
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,560
with rotating by t radians. So, to solve the system, if you want to predict where Romeo and

139
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,800
Juliet end up after t units of time, you can multiply this matrix by their initial state.

140
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,400
The active viewers among you might also enjoy taking a moment to pause and confirm that the

141
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,440
explicit formula as you get out of this for x of t and y of t really do satisfy the system of

142
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:19,760
differential equations that we started with. The mathematician in you might wonder if it's

143
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,720
possible to solve not just this specific system, but equations like it for any other matrix,

144
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,080
no matter what its coefficients. To ask this question is to set yourself up to rediscover

145
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,440
matrix exponents. The main goal for today is for you to understand how this equation lets you

146
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,880
intuitively picture the operation which we write as e raised to a matrix, and on the flip side,

147
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,440
how being able to compute matrix exponents lets you explicitly solve this equation.

148
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,280
A much less whimsical example is Schrodinger's famous equation, which is the fundamental equation

149
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:57,040
describing how systems in quantum mechanics change over time. It looks pretty intimidating,

150
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,880
and I mean it's quantum mechanics, so of course it will, but it's actually not that different

151
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,240
from the Romeo-Juliet setup. This symbol here refers to a certain vector. It's a vector that

152
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,640
packages together all the information you might care about in a system, like the various particles,

153
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,600
positions, and momenta. It's analogous to our simpler 2D vector that encoded all the information

154
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,600
about Romeo and Juliet. The equation says that the rate at which this state vector changes looks

155
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,880
like a certain matrix times itself. There are a number of things that make Schrodinger's equation

156
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,360
notably more complicated, but in the back of your mind you might think of it as a target point that

157
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,560
you and I can build up to, with simpler examples, like Romeo and Juliet, offering more friendly

158
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,240
stepping stones along the way. Actually, the simplest example, which is tied to ordinary

159
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,680
real number powers of e, is the one-dimensional case. This is when you have a single changing value,

160
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,360
and its rate of change equals some constant times itself. So the bigger the value, the faster it grows.

161
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,280
Most people are more comfortable visualizing this with a graph, where the higher the value

162
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,240
of the graph, the steeper its slope, resulting in this ever-steepening upward curve. Just keep

163
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
in mind that when we get to higher dimensional variants, graphs are a lot less helpful.

164
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,200
This is a highly important equation in its own right. It's a very powerful concept when the

165
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,000
rate of change of a value is proportional to the value itself. This is the equation governing

166
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,120
things like compound interest, or the early stages of population growth, before the effects of

167
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,040
limited resources kick in, or the early stages of an epidemic, while most of the population is susceptible.

168
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:37,280
Calculus students all learn about how the derivative of e to the rt is r times itself.

169
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,880
In other words, this self-reinforcing growth phenomenon is the same thing as exponential

170
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,720
growth, and e to the rt solves this equation. Actually, a better way to think about it is that

171
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,200
there are many different solutions to this equation, one for each initial condition,

172
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,080
something like an initial investment size or an initial population, which we'll just call x0.

173
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,680
Notice, by the way, how the higher the value for x0, the higher the initial slope of the

174
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,760
resulting solution, which should make a complete sense given the equation.

175
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:18,080
The function e to the rt is just a solution when the initial condition is 1, but if you multiply

176
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,800
by any other initial condition, you get a new function which still satisfies this property,

177
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,560
it still has a derivative which is r times itself. But this time it starts at x0, since

178
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,680
e to the 0 is 1. This is worth highlighting before we generalize to more dimensions.

179
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,600
Do not think of the exponential part as being a solution in and of itself.

180
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,320
Think of it as something that acts on an initial condition in order to give a solution.

181
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:50,320
You see, up in the two-dimensional case, when we have a changing vector whose

182
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,320
rate of change is constrained to be some matrix times itself, what the solution looks like is also

183
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,760
an exponential term acting on a given initial condition. But the exponential part in that case

184
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,440
will produce a matrix that changes with time, and the initial condition is a vector. In fact,

185
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,920
you should think of the definition of matrix exponentiation as being heavily motivated

186
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,960
by making sure that this fact is true. For example, if we look back at the system that

187
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:23,040
popped up with Romeo and Juliet, the claim now is that solutions look like e raised to this

188
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:28,720
0, negative 1, 1, 0 matrix, all times time, multiplied by some initial condition.

189
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,360
But we've already seen the solution in this case. We know it looks like a rotation matrix

190
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,840
times the initial condition. So let's take a moment to roll up our sleeves and compute the

191
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,240
exponential term using the definition that I mentioned at the start and see if it lines up.

192
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:48,320
Remember, writing e to the power of a matrix is a shorthand, a shorthand for plugging it in

193
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,320
to this long infinite polynomial, the Taylor series for e to the x. I know it might seem

194
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,360
pretty complicated to do this, but trust me, it's very satisfying how this particular one turns out.

195
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,240
If you actually sit down and you compute successive powers of this matrix,

196
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:20,160
what you'd notice is that they fall into a cycling pattern every four iterations.

197
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,800
This should make sense given that we know it's a 90 degree rotation matrix.

198
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,800
So when you add together all infinitely many matrices, term by term, each term in the result

199
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:41,920
looks like a polynomial in t with some nice cycling pattern in its coefficients,

200
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,320
all of them scaled by the relevant factorial term.

201
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,920
Those of you who are savvy with Taylor series might be able to recognize that each one of

202
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,280
these components is the Taylor series for either sine or cosine, though in that top right corner's

203
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,920
case it's actually negative sine. So what we get from the computation is exactly the rotation

204
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:11,440
matrix we had from before. To me, this is extremely beautiful. We have two completely different ways

205
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,240
of reasoning about the same system and they give us the same answer. I mean, it's reassuring that

206
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,480
they do, but it is wild just how different the mode of thought is when you're chugging through

207
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,200
this polynomial versus when you're geometrically reasoning about what a velocity perpendicular

208
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,560
to a position must imply. Hopefully, the fact that these line up inspires a little confidence

209
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,920
in the claim that matrix exponents really do solve systems like this. This explains the

210
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,240
computation we saw at the start, by the way, with the matrix that had negative pi and pi

211
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,280
off the diagonals, producing the negative identity. This expression is exponentiating

212
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,120
a 90 degree rotation matrix times pi, which is another way to describe what the Romeo-Juliet

213
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,520
setup does after pi units of time. As we now know, that has the effect of rotating everything 180

214
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,920
degrees in this state space, which is the same as multiplying by negative one. Also, for any of you

215
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,560
familiar with imaginary number exponents, this particular example is probably ringing a ton of

216
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,400
bells. It is 100% analogous. In fact, we could have framed the entire example where Romeo and

217
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,120
Juliet's feelings were packaged into a complex number, and the rate of change of that complex

218
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,560
number would have been i times itself, since multiplication by i also acts like a 90 degree

219
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:30,160
rotation. The same exact line of reasoning, both analytic and geometric, would have led to this

220
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:36,240
whole idea that e to the power i t describes rotation. These are actually two of many different

221
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,560
examples throughout math and physics, when you find yourself exponentiating some object which

222
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:46,640
acts as a 90 degree rotation times time. It shows up with quaternions or many of the matrices that

223
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,840
pop up in quantum mechanics. In all of these cases, we have this really neat general idea

224
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,880
that if you take some operation that rotates 90 degrees in some plane, often it's a plane in

225
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,320
some high-dimensional space that we can't visualize, then what we get by exponentiating that operation

226
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,040
times time is something that generates all other rotations in that same plane.

227
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,600
One of the more complicated variations on this same theme is Schrodinger's equation.

228
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,640
It's not just that this has the derivative of a state equal some matrix times that state form.

229
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,040
The nature of the relevant matrix here is such that the equation also describes a kind of rotation,

230
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,200
though in many applications of Schrodinger's equation it'll be a rotation in a kind of function

231
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,080
space. It's a little more involved though because typically there's a combination of many different

232
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,880
rotations. It takes time to really dig into this equation, and I would love to do that in a later

233
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,200
chapter, but right now I cannot help but at least allude to the fact that this imaginary unit i that

234
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,640
sits so impishly in such a fundamental equation for all of the universe is playing basically the same

235
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,320
role as the matrix from our Romeo and Juliet example. What this i communicates is that the

236
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,880
rate of change of a certain state is, in a sense, perpendicular to that state, and hence that the

237
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,560
way things have to evolve over time will involve a kind of oscillation.

238
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,240
But matrix exponentiation can do so much more than just rotation. You can always visualize

239
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,840
these sorts of differential equations using a vector field. The idea is that this equation

240
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,040
tells us the velocity of a state is entirely determined by its position, so what we do is go

241
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,920
to every point in the space and draw a little vector indicating what the velocity of a state

242
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,840
must be if it passes through that point. For our type of equation, this means that we go to each

243
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:56,480
point v in space and we attach the vector m times v. To intuitively understand how any given initial

244
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,840
condition will evolve, you let it flow along this field with a velocity always matching whatever

245
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:07,600
vector it's sitting on at any given point in time. So if the claim is that solutions to this

246
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,680
equation look like e to the mt times some initial condition, it means you can visualize what the

247
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:19,920
matrix e to the mt does by letting every possible initial condition flow along this field for t

248
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:30,000
units of time. The transition from start to finish is described by whatever matrix pops out from

249
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,480
the computation for e to the mt. In our main example with the 90-degree rotation matrix,

250
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,240
the vector field looks like this, and as we saw, e to the mt describes rotation in that case,

251
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,640
which lines up with flow along this field. As another example, the more Shakespearean Romeo

252
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,800
and Juliet might have equations that look a little more like this, where Juliet's rule

253
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,520
is symmetric with Romeo's, and both of them are inclined to get carried away in response to one

254
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,560
another's feelings. Again, the way the vector field you're looking at has been defined is to go

255
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:08,960
to each point v in space and attach the vector m times v. This is the pictorial way of saying that

256
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,080
the rate of change of a state must always equal m times itself. But for this example, flow along

257
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:21,200
the field looks a lot different from how it did before. If Romeo and Juliet start off anywhere

258
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,680
in this upper right half of the plane, their feelings will feed off of each other and they

259
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:33,680
both tend towards infinity. If they're in the other half of the plane, well, let's just say

260
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,880
that they stay more true to their Capulet and Montague family traditions. So even before you

261
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,760
try calculating the exponential of this particular matrix, you can already have an intuitive sense

262
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,960
for what the answer should look like. The resulting matrix should describe the transition from time

263
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,560
zero to time t, which, if you look at the field, seems to indicate that it will squish along one

264
00:24:54,560 --> 00:25:01,520
diagonal while stretching along another, getting more extreme as t gets larger. Of course, all of

265
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,640
this is presuming that e to the mt times an initial condition actually solves these systems.

266
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,040
This is one of those facts that's easiest to believe when you just work it out yourself.

267
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,920
But I'll run through a quick rough sketch. Write out the full polynomial that defines

268
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,080
e to the mt and multiply by some initial condition vector on the right.

269
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,920
And then take the derivative of this with respect to t. Because the matrix m is a constant,

270
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,640
this just means applying the power rule to each one of the terms.

271
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,040
And that power rule really nicely cancels out with the factorial terms.

272
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:58,080
So what we're left with is an expression that looks almost identical to what we had before,

273
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,880
except that each term has an extra m hanging onto it. But this can be factored out to the left.

274
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,840
So the derivative of the expression is m times the original expression, and hence it solves the

275
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,360
equation. This actually sweeps under the rug some details required for rigor, mostly centered

276
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,760
around the question of whether or not this thing actually converges, but it does give the main idea.

277
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,120
In the next chapter I would like to talk more about the properties that this operation has,

278
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,080
most notably its relationship with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which leads us to more concrete

279
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,720
ways of thinking about how you actually carry out this computation, which otherwise seems insane.

280
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,160
Also, time permitting, it might be fun to talk about what it means to raise e to the power of

281
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
the derivative operator.
