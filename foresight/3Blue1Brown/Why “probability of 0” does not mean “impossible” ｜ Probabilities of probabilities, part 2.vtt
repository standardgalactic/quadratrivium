00:00.000 --> 00:07.120
Imagine you have a weighted coin, so the probability of flipping heads it might not

00:07.120 --> 00:18.640
be 50-50 exactly, it could be 20%, or maybe 90%, or 0%, or 31.41592%.

00:18.640 --> 00:20.840
The point is that you just don't know.

00:20.840 --> 00:25.120
But imagine that you flip this coin ten different times, and seven of those times it comes up

00:25.120 --> 00:26.120
heads.

00:26.120 --> 00:30.880
Do you think that the underlying weight of this coin is such that each flip has a 70%

00:30.880 --> 00:32.800
chance of coming up heads?

00:32.800 --> 00:37.680
If I were to ask you, hey, what's the probability that the true probability of flipping heads

00:37.680 --> 00:41.960
is 0.7, what would you say?

00:41.960 --> 00:44.920
This is a pretty weird question, and for two reasons.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.840
First of all, it's asking about a probability of a probability, as in the value we don't

00:49.840 --> 00:55.080
know is itself some kind of long-run frequency for a random event, which frankly is hard

00:55.080 --> 00:56.480
to think about.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.960
But the more pressing weirdness comes from asking about probabilities in the setting

00:59.960 --> 01:02.760
of continuous values.

01:02.760 --> 01:07.680
Let's give this unknown probability of flipping heads some kind of name, like h.

01:07.680 --> 01:13.360
Keep in mind that h could be any real number from 0 up to 1, ranging from a coin that always

01:13.360 --> 01:19.040
flips tails, up to one that always flips heads, and everything in between.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.720
So if I ask, hey, what's the probability that h is precisely 0.7, as opposed to say

01:24.720 --> 01:32.600
0.7000001, or any other nearby value, well there's going to be a strong possibility for

01:32.600 --> 01:34.940
paradox if we're not careful.

01:34.940 --> 01:38.720
It feels like no matter how small the answer to this question, it just wouldn't be small

01:38.720 --> 01:40.040
enough.

01:40.040 --> 01:45.360
If every specific value within some range, all uncountably infinitely many of them, has

01:45.360 --> 01:50.000
a non-zero probability, well even if that probability was minuscule, adding them all

01:50.000 --> 01:55.960
up to get the total probability of any one of these values will blow up to infinity.

01:55.960 --> 02:00.080
On the other hand though, if all of these probabilities are 0, aside from the fact that

02:00.080 --> 02:05.440
that now gives you no useful information about the coin, the total sum of those probabilities

02:05.440 --> 02:08.720
would be 0 when it should be 1.

02:08.720 --> 02:14.160
After all, this weight of the coin h is something, so the probability of it being any one of

02:14.160 --> 02:17.520
these values should add up to 1.

02:17.520 --> 02:25.240
So if these values can't all be non-zero, and they can't all be 0, what do you do?

02:25.240 --> 02:28.560
Where we're going with this, by the way, is that I'd like to talk about the very practical

02:28.560 --> 02:33.320
question of using data to create meaningful answers to these sorts of probabilities of

02:33.320 --> 02:35.760
probabilities questions.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.480
But for this video, let's take a moment to appreciate how to work with probabilities

02:39.480 --> 02:49.840
over continuous values and resolve this apparent paradox.

02:49.840 --> 02:54.640
The key is not to focus on individual values, but ranges of values.

02:54.640 --> 02:59.280
For example, we might make these buckets to represent the probability that h is between

02:59.280 --> 03:03.280
say 0.8 and 0.85.

03:03.280 --> 03:07.320
Also and this is more important than it might seem, rather than thinking of the height of

03:07.320 --> 03:12.320
each of these bars as representing the probability, think of the area of each one as representing

03:12.320 --> 03:14.160
that probability.

03:14.160 --> 03:18.040
Where exactly those areas come from is something that we'll answer later.

03:18.040 --> 03:22.240
For right now, just know that, in principle, there's some answer to the probability of

03:22.240 --> 03:25.080
h sitting inside one of these ranges.

03:25.080 --> 03:29.520
Our task right now is to take the answers to these very coarse-grained questions, and

03:29.520 --> 03:35.680
to get a more exact understanding of the distribution at the level of each individual input.

03:35.680 --> 03:40.280
The natural thing to do would be to consider finer and finer buckets, and when you do, the

03:40.280 --> 03:45.320
smaller probability of falling into any one of them is accounted for in the thinner width

03:45.320 --> 03:49.800
of each of these bars, while the heights are going to stay roughly the same.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.800
That's important because it means that as you take this process to the limit, you approach

03:53.800 --> 03:56.000
some kind of smooth curve.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.880
So even though all of the individual probabilities of falling into any one particular bucket

04:00.880 --> 04:06.440
will approach zero, the overall shape of the distribution is preserved and even refined

04:06.440 --> 04:09.120
in this limit.

04:09.120 --> 04:13.480
If on the other hand we had let the heights of the bars represent probabilities, everything

04:13.480 --> 04:20.480
would have gone to zero.

04:20.480 --> 04:24.480
So in the limit, we would have just had a flat line giving no information about the overall

04:24.480 --> 04:27.520
shape of the distribution.

04:27.520 --> 04:31.440
So wonderful, letting area represent probability helps solve this problem.

04:31.440 --> 04:36.480
But let me ask you, if the y-axis no longer represents probability, what exactly are the

04:36.480 --> 04:38.280
units here?

04:38.280 --> 04:43.480
Since probability sits in the area of these bars, or width times height, the height represents

04:43.480 --> 04:49.240
a kind of probability per unit in the x direction, what's known in the business as a probability

04:49.240 --> 04:50.640
density.

04:50.640 --> 04:54.680
The other thing to keep in mind is that the total area of all these bars has to equal

04:54.680 --> 04:57.200
one at every level of the process.

04:57.200 --> 05:02.280
That's something that has to be true for any valid probability distribution.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.800
The idea of probability density is actually really clever when you step back to think

05:05.800 --> 05:08.520
about it, as you take things to the limit.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.920
Even if there's all sorts of paradoxes associated with assigning a probability to each of these

05:12.920 --> 05:18.640
uncountably infinitely many values of h between zero and one, there's no problem if we associate

05:18.640 --> 05:23.200
a probability density to each one of them, giving what's known as a probability density

05:23.200 --> 05:26.560
function, or PDF for short.

05:26.560 --> 05:30.800
Any time you see a PDF in the wild, the way to interpret it is that the probability of

05:30.800 --> 05:36.840
your random variable lying between two values equals the area under this curve between those

05:36.840 --> 05:38.200
values.

05:38.200 --> 05:42.560
So for example, what's the probability of getting any one very specific number, like

05:42.560 --> 05:43.560
0.7?

05:43.560 --> 05:49.120
Well, the area of an infinitely thin slice is zero, so it's zero.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.520
What's the probability of all of them put together?

05:52.040 --> 05:54.720
Well, the area under the full curve is one.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.840
You see, paradox sidestepped.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.800
And the way that it's been sidestepped is a bit subtle.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.520
In normal finite settings, like rolling a die or drawing a card, the probability that

06:05.520 --> 06:10.840
a random value falls into a given collection of possibilities is simply the sum of the

06:10.840 --> 06:13.960
probabilities of being any one of them.

06:13.960 --> 06:18.640
This feels very intuitive, it's even true in a countably infinite context, but to deal

06:18.640 --> 06:22.120
with the continuum, the rules themselves have shifted.

06:22.120 --> 06:27.080
The probability of falling into a range of values is no longer the sum of the probabilities

06:27.080 --> 06:29.160
of each individual value.

06:29.160 --> 06:35.040
Instead, probabilities associated with ranges are the fundamental primitive objects, and

06:35.040 --> 06:39.160
the only sense in which it's meaningful to talk about an individual value here is to

06:39.160 --> 06:42.240
think of it as a range of width zero.

06:42.240 --> 06:46.560
If the idea of the rules changing between a finite setting and a continuous one feels

06:46.560 --> 06:50.600
unsettling, well, you'll be happy to know that mathematicians are way ahead of you.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.920
There's a field of math called measure theory, which helps to unite these two settings and

06:54.920 --> 06:59.920
make rigorous the idea of associating numbers like probabilities to various subsets of all

06:59.920 --> 07:04.280
possibilities in a way that combines and distributes nicely.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.600
For example, let's say you're in a setting where you have a random number that equals

07:07.600 --> 07:13.200
zero with 50% probability, and the rest of the time it's some positive number according

07:13.200 --> 07:16.860
to a distribution that looks like half of a bell curve.

07:16.860 --> 07:21.320
This is an awkward middle ground between a finite context, where a single value has

07:21.320 --> 07:26.400
a nonzero probability, and a continuous one, where probabilities are found according to

07:26.400 --> 07:29.640
areas under the appropriate density function.

07:29.640 --> 07:33.040
This is the sort of thing that measure theory handles very smoothly.

07:33.040 --> 07:36.880
I mentioned this mainly for the especially curious viewer, and you can find more reading

07:36.880 --> 07:41.080
material in the description.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.840
It's a pretty common rule of thumb that if you find yourself using a sum in a discrete

07:44.840 --> 07:49.880
context, then use an integral in the continuous context, which is the tool from calculus that

07:49.880 --> 07:52.440
we use to find areas under curves.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.840
In fact, you could argue this video would be way shorter if I just said that at the

07:55.840 --> 07:57.840
front and called it good.

07:57.840 --> 08:02.000
For my part, though, I always found it a little unsatisfying to do this blindly without thinking

08:02.000 --> 08:04.200
through what it really means.

08:04.200 --> 08:08.920
And in fact, if you really dig into the theoretical underpinnings of integrals, what you'd find

08:08.920 --> 08:13.520
is that in addition to the way that it's defined in a typical intro calculus class,

08:13.520 --> 08:17.800
there is a separate, more powerful definition that's based on measure theory, this formal

08:17.800 --> 08:21.200
foundation of probability.

08:21.200 --> 08:25.480
If I look back to when I first learned probability, I definitely remember grappling with this

08:25.480 --> 08:29.880
weird idea that in continuous settings, like random variables that are real numbers or

08:29.880 --> 08:34.560
throwing a dart at a dartboard, you have a bunch of outcomes that are possible, and yet

08:34.560 --> 08:40.280
each one has a probability of zero, and somehow altogether they have a probability of one.

08:40.280 --> 08:45.360
Now, one step of coming to terms with this is to realize that possibility is better tied

08:45.360 --> 08:50.440
to probability density than probability, but just swapping out sums of one for integrals

08:50.440 --> 08:53.200
of the others never quite scratched the itch for me.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.680
I remember that it only really clicked when I realized that the rules for combining probabilities

08:57.680 --> 09:01.480
of different sets were not quite what I thought they were, and there was simply a different

09:01.480 --> 09:04.680
axiom system underlying it all.

09:04.680 --> 09:09.360
But anyway, steering away from the theory somewhere back in the loose direction of application,

09:09.360 --> 09:13.120
look back to our original question about the coin with an unknown weight.

09:13.120 --> 09:17.620
What we've learned here is that the right question to ask is, what's the probability

09:17.620 --> 09:23.600
density function that describes this value h after seeing the outcomes of a few tosses?

09:23.600 --> 09:28.640
If you can find that PDF, you can use it to answer questions like, what's the probability

09:28.640 --> 09:33.840
that the true probability of flipping heads falls between 0.6 and 0.8?

09:33.840 --> 09:36.040
To find that PDF, join me in the next part.
