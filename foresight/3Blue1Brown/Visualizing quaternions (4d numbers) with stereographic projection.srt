1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
What you are looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication, or rather

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,560
you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion happening on a four-dimensional

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,040
sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space, one which you'll understand by the

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:22,080
end of this video.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
Quaternions are an absolutely fascinating and often underappreciated number system from

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,440
math.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,000
Just as complex numbers are a two-dimensional extension of the real numbers, quaternions

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers.

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,640
But they're not just playful mathematical shenanigans, they have a surprisingly pragmatic

10
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,120
utility for describing rotation in three dimensions, and even for quantum mechanics.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,240
The story of their discovery is also quite famous in math.

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,640
The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton spent much of his life seeking a three-dimensional

13
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,000
number system, analogous to the complex numbers.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
And as the story goes, his son would ask him every morning whether or not he had figured

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,400
out how to divide triples, and he would always say, no, not yet.

16
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:08,960
But on October 16th, 1843, while crossing the Broome Bridge in Dublin, he realized with

17
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,360
a supposed flash of insight that what he needed was not to add a single dimension to the complex

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,720
numbers, but to add two more imaginary dimensions, three imaginary dimensions describing space

19
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,120
and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in some kind of fourth dimension.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,440
He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge,

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,280
which today bears a plaque in his honor showing that equation.

22
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,520
Now you have to understand, our modern notion of vectors with their dot product and the

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,920
cross product and things like that didn't really exist in Hamilton's time, at least

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,880
not in a standardized form.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,840
So after his discovery, he pushed hard for quaternions to be the primary language with

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,440
which we teach students to describe three-dimensional space, even forming an official quaternion

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,920
society to proselytize his discovery.

28
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,520
Now, unfortunately, this was balanced with mathematicians on the other side of the fence,

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,440
who believed that the confusing notion of quaternion multiplication was not necessary for describing

30
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,200
three dimensions, resulting in some truly hilarious, old-timey trash talk legitimately

31
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,360
calling them evil.

32
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,480
It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene from Alice in Wonderland, whose author you

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,160
may know was an Oxford mathematician, was written in reference to quaternions, that

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,680
the chaotic table placement changes were mocking their multiplication, and that certain quotes

35
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
were referencing their non-commutative nature.

36
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,480
Fast forward about a century, and the computing industry gave quaternions a resurgence among

37
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,080
programmers who work with graphics and robotics and anything involving orientation in 3D space.

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,240
And this is because they give an elegant way to describe and compute 3D rotations, which

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,320
is computationally more efficient than other methods, and which also avoids a lot of the

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,280
numerical errors that arise in these other methods.

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,880
The 20th century also brought quaternions some more love from a completely different direction,

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
quantum mechanics.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,680
You see, the special actions that quaternions describe in four dimensions are actually quite

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,880
relevant to the way that two-state systems, like spin of an electron or the polarization

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,680
of a photon, are described mathematically.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,960
What I'll show you here is a way to visualize quaternions in their full four-dimensional

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
glory.

48
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,800
I would surprise me if this approach was fully original, but I can say that it's certainly

49
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,480
not the standard way to teach quaternions, and that the specific four-dimensional right-hand

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,240
rule image that I'd like to build up to is something that I haven't really seen elsewhere.

51
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,800
Building up an understanding for this visual will take us meaningful time, but once you

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,280
have it, there is a very natural and satisfying intuition for how to think about quaternion

53
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,780
multiplication.

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,160
It won't be until the next video that I show you how exactly quaternions describe orientation

55
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,240
in three dimensions, which is, for some people, the whole reason we care about it, but once

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,760
we're able to go at it armed with the image of what they're doing to a 4D hypersphere,

57
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,920
there's a pleasing understanding to be had for the otherwise opaque formulas characterizing

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,480
this relationship.

59
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,980
The structure here will be to start by imagining teaching complex numbers to someone who only

60
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,720
understands one dimension, then describing 3D rotations to someone who only understands

61
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,040
two dimensions, and ultimately to represent what quaternions are doing up in four dimensions

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:17,520
within the constraints of our 3D space.

63
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,160
Our first character is Linus the Linedlander, whose mind can only grasp the one-dimensional

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,960
geometry of lines in the algebra of real numbers.

65
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,240
We're going to try to describe complex numbers to Linus, and it's really important for you

66
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,280
to empathize with him as much as you can during this, because in a few minutes, you're going

67
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,960
to be in his shoes.

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,760
On the one hand, you could define complex numbers purely algebraically.

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:43,480
You say each one is expressed as some real number plus some other real number times i,

70
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,120
where i is a newly invented constant whose defining property is that i times i equals

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,520
negative one.

72
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,160
Then you say to Linus, to multiply two complex numbers, you just use the distributive property,

73
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,480
what many people learn in school as foil, and you apply this rule that i times i equals

74
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,440
negative one to simplify things down further.

75
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,440
And that's fine, that totally works, and the standard textbook way to introduce quaternions

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,440
is analogous to this, showing the algebraic rules and calling it done.

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,240
But I think something is missing if we don't at least try to show Linus the geometry of

78
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,760
complex numbers, and what complex multiplication looks like, since the problems in math and

79
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:26,320
physics where complex numbers are shockingly useful often leverage this spatial intuition.

80
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,800
You and I, who understand two dimensions, might think of it like this.

81
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,120
When you multiply two complex numbers, z times w, you can think of z as a sort of function

82
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,000
acting on w, rotating and stretching it in some way.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,800
I like to think of this by broadening the view and asking, what does z do to the entire

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
plane?

85
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,280
And you can think of that bird's eye view action by imagining using one hand to fix

86
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,880
the number zero in place, and using another hand to drag the point at one up to z, since

87
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,200
anything times zero is zero, and anything times one is itself.

88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,120
And in two dimensions, there is one and only one stretching rotating action on the plane

89
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,600
that'll do this.

90
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,360
This is also how I'll have you thinking about quaternion multiplication later on, where

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,240
the number on the left acts as a kind of function to the one on the right.

92
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,760
And we'll understand this function by seeing how it acts by transforming space, although

93
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:23,320
instead of rotating 2D space, it does a sort of double rotation in 4D space.

94
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,920
By the way, if you want to review thinking about complex numbers as a kind of action,

95
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,720
a good warm up for this video might be the one I did on e to the pi i explained with

96
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,800
introductory group theory.

97
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,480
The Linus the Linelander is pretty comfortable with the idea of stretching, that's what

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,160
multiplication by real numbers looks like.

99
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,520
Maybe it's a little weird for him to think about stretching in multiple dimensions, but

100
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,520
it's not fundamentally different.

101
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,960
The difficult thing to communicate to Linus is rotation, specifically focus on the unit

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,080
circle of the complex plane, all the numbers a distance one from zero, since multiplication

103
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,320
by these numbers corresponds to pure rotation.

104
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:04,920
How would you explain to Linus the look and the feel of multiplying by these numbers?

105
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,200
At first, that might seem impossible, I mean rotation is just such an intrinsically two

106
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,920
dimensional idea, but on the other hand, rotation involves only one degree of freedom, a single

107
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,240
number, the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely.

108
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,880
So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all rotations to the

109
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,640
one dimensional continuum that is Linus's world.

110
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,760
And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you is what's

111
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:36,720
called a stereographic projection, it's a special way to map a circle onto a line, or

112
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:46,280
a sphere into a plane, or even a 4D hypersphere into 3D space.

113
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,720
For every point on the unit circle, draw a line from negative one through that point,

114
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,720
and wherever it intersects the vertical line through the circle center, that's where the

115
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,640
point of the circle gets projected.

116
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:05,520
So for example, the point at one gets projected into the center of the line, the point i actually

117
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,760
stays fixed in place, as does negative i.

118
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:16,200
All of the points on that 90 degree arc between one and i will get projected somewhere in

119
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:21,560
the interval between where one landed and where i landed, as you continue farther around

120
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
the circle on the arc between i and negative one, the projected points end up farther

121
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,760
and farther away at an increasing rate.

122
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:33,120
Similarly, if you come around the other way towards negative one, the projected points

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,760
end up farther and farther on the other end of the line.

124
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,360
This line of projected points is what we show to Linus, labeling a few key points, like

125
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
one and i and negative one all for reference.

126
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,280
Technically, the point at negative one has no projection under this map, since the tangent

127
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,960
line to the circle at that point never crosses the vertical line.

128
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,000
But what we say is that negative one ends up at the point at infinity.

129
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,720
This is a special point you imagine adding to the line, where you would approach it,

130
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,880
if you walk infinitely far along the line in either direction.

131
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,040
Now it's important to remember, and to remind Linus, that what he's seeing is only the

132
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,520
complex numbers that are a distance one from the origin, the unit circle.

133
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:19,000
Linus doesn't see most numbers, like zero, or one plus i, or negative two minus i, but

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,720
that's okay, because right now we just want to describe complex numbers z, where multiplying

135
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:31,200
by z has the effect of a pure rotation, so he only needs to understand the unit circle.

136
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,560
For example, when we take the number i and multiply it by any other complex number w,

137
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,440
the effect is to rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

138
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,800
And when we apply this action to the circle, being projected down to the line for Linus,

139
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
what does he see?

140
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,660
Well, it's a bit of a strange morphing action on the line, one which I want you to become

141
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,520
familiar with for something we'll see later on.

142
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,240
It's easiest to understand by following a few key reference points.

143
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:04,000
i times one is i, so that means the number one should move up to i.

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,480
i times i is negative one, so the point at i slides off to infinity.

145
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,200
i times negative one is equal to negative i, so that point at infinity kind of comes

146
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,360
back around from the bottom to the position one unit below the center.

147
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:26,520
And i times negative i is one, so that point at negative i slides up to one.

148
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,960
Even though this is kind of a weird motion, it lets us communicate some important ideas

149
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,160
to Linus.

150
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,840
For example, multiplying by i four times, which corresponds to rotating by 90 degrees

151
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,160
four times in a row, gets us back to where we started.

152
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,800
i to the fourth equals one.

153
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,080
Here, to get more of a feel for things, let me just show the circle rotated at various

154
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,080
different angles.

155
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,240
On both the left and the right half of the screen here, I'm putting a hand on the point

156
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,000
that started at the number one to help us and to help Linus keep track of the overall

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:06,920
motion.

158
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,040
Next let's introduce Felix the Flatlander, who only understands two-dimensional geometry.

159
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:18,280
Imagine trying to explain rotations of a sphere to Felix.

160
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,000
In the spirit of transitioning from complex numbers to quaternions, let's extend the

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,560
complex numbers with its horizontal axis of real numbers and its vertical axis of imaginary

162
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,240
numbers with a third axis, defined by some newly invented constant, J, sitting one unit

163
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,000
away from zero, perpendicular to the complex plane.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,840
Instead of having this new axis in the z direction, like you might expect, for a better

165
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,840
analogy with how we'll visualize quaternions, we'll want to orient things so that the i

166
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:50,880
and the j axes sit in the x and the y directions, with the real number line aligned along the

167
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,600
z direction.

168
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,600
So every point in 3D space is described as some real number plus some real number times

169
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,800
i plus some real number times j.

170
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,960
As it happens, it's not possible to define a notion of multiplication for a 3D number

171
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,440
system like this that would satisfy the usual algebraic properties that make multiplication

172
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,940
a useful construct.

173
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,720
Perhaps I'll outline why this is the case in a follow-on video, but staying focused

174
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:20,880
on our current goal, think about describing 3D rotations in this coordinate system to

175
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Felix the Flatlander.

176
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,080
The unit sphere consists of all those numbers which are a distance one from zero at the

177
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:35,320
origin, meaning the sum of the squares of their coordinates is one.

178
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,400
We can't show all of 3D space to Felix, but what we can do is project this 2D surface

179
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:46,200
to him and give him a feel for what reorientations of this sphere look like under that projection.

180
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,880
Analogous to what we did before, stereographic projection will associate almost every point

181
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,960
on the unit sphere with a unique point on the horizontal plane defined by the i and

182
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,600
the j axes.

183
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,160
For each point on the sphere, draw a line from negative one at the south pole through

184
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:12,520
that point and see where it intersects the plane.

185
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,240
So the point one at the north pole ends up at the center of the plane.

186
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,560
All of the points of the northern hemisphere get mapped somewhere inside the unit circle

187
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:26,120
of the i, j plane, and that unit circle, which passes through i, j, negative i, negative

188
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,960
j, actually stays fixed in place.

189
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,320
And that's an important point to make note of.

190
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Even though most points and lines and patches that Felix the Flatlander sees are going to

191
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,960
be warped projections of the real sphere, this unit circle is the one thing that he

192
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:47,560
has which is an honest part of our unit sphere, unaltered by projection.

193
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,800
All of the points in the southern hemisphere get projected outside that unit circle, each

194
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,480
getting farther and farther away as you approach negative one at the south pole.

195
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,800
And again, negative one has no projection under this mapping, but what we say is that

196
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,620
it ends up at some point at infinity.

197
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:07,280
That point at infinity is something such that no matter which direction you walk on the

198
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,600
plane, as you go infinitely far out, you'll be approaching that point.

199
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,640
It's analogous to how if you walk any direction away from the north pole, you're approaching

200
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:19,280
the south pole.

201
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,000
Now let me just pull up a view of what Felix sees in two dimensions.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,200
As I rotate the sphere in various ways, the lines of latitude and longitude drawn on that

203
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:33,160
sphere get projected into various circles and lines in Felix's space.

204
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,960
And the way I've done things up here, the checkerboard pattern on the surface of the

205
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:40,520
sphere is accurately reflected in the projected view that you see with Felix.

206
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,600
And the pink dot represents where the point that started at the north pole ends up after

207
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,120
the rotation.

208
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,120
And that yellow circle represents where the equator ended up after the projection.

209
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,800
The more you put yourself in Felix's shoes right now, the easier quaternions will be

210
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,000
in a moment.

211
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,720
And as with Linus, it helps to focus on a few key reference objects rather than trying

212
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
to see the whole sphere.

213
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:09,320
This circle, passing through one, i, negative one, and negative i, gets mapped onto a line

214
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,640
which Felix sees as the horizontal axis.

215
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,560
It's important to remind Felix that what he sees is not the same thing as the i-axis.

216
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,040
Remember, we're only projecting the numbers that have a distance one from the origin.

217
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,840
So most points on the actual i-axis, like zero and two i and three i, etc., are completely

218
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,640
invisible to Felix.

219
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:35,840
Similarly, the circle that passes through one, j, negative one, and negative j gets projected

220
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,840
onto what he sees as a vertical line.

221
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:43,840
And in general, any line that Felix sees comes from some circle on the sphere that

222
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,920
passes through negative one.

223
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:55,600
In some sense, a line is just a circle that passes through the pointed infinity.

224
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,800
Now think about what Felix sees as we rotate the sphere.

225
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,920
A 90-degree rotation about the j-axis brings one to i, i to negative one, negative one

226
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,080
to negative i, and negative i to one.

227
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,720
Also what Felix the Flatlander sees is an extension of the rotation that Linus the

228
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,880
Linelander was seeing.

229
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,240
Notice also that this action rotates the i, j unit circle to the position where the one

230
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,480
j unit circle used to be.

231
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,960
So what Felix sees is his yellow unit circle getting transformed into a vertical line while

232
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,200
that red vertical line gets transformed into the unit circle.

233
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,720
Of course, from our perspective, we know this is all just rigid motion.

234
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,440
No actual stretching or morphing is taking place.

235
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,680
All of that is just an artifact of the projection.

236
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,600
Similarly, a rotation about the i-axis involves moving one to j, j to negative one, negative

237
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
one to negative j, and negative j to one.

238
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,640
This rotation turns the i, j unit circle into the one i unit circle, which to Felix looks

239
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:09,480
like the unit circle getting transformed into a horizontal line.

240
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,920
A rotation about the real axis is actually quite easy for Felix to understand, since

241
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,880
the whole projection simply gets rotated about the origin, where the only points staying

242
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:29,280
fixed in place are one at the origin and negative one off at infinity.

243
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,640
In the same way that the complex numbers included the real numbers with a single extra quote

244
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,200
unquote imaginary dimension represented by the unit i, and that the not actually a number

245
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:45,240
system thing we had in three dimensions included a second imaginary direction, j, the quaternions

246
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,920
include the real numbers together with three separate imaginary dimensions represented by

247
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,720
the units i, j, and k.

248
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,280
Each of these three imaginary dimensions is perpendicular to the real number line and

249
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,920
they're all perpendicular to each other somehow.

250
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,600
So in the same way that complex numbers are represented as a pair of real numbers, each

251
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:12,200
quaternion can be written using four real numbers and it lives in four dimensional space.

252
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,080
You often think of this as being broken up into a real or scalar part and then a 3D imaginary

253
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,080
part.

254
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,440
And Hamilton used a special word for quaternions that had no real part and just i, j, k components,

255
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,000
a word which was previously somewhat foreign in the lingo of math and physics, vector.

256
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,560
On the one hand, you could just define quaternion multiplication by giving the rules for how

257
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:38,840
i, j, and k multiply together and saying that everything must distribute nicely.

258
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,800
This is analogous to defining complex multiplication by saying that i times i is negative one and

259
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,320
then distributing and simplifying products.

260
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,960
And indeed, this is how you would tell a computer to perform quaternion multiplication and the

261
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,920
relative compactness of this operation compared to say matrix multiplication is what's made

262
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,400
quaternion so useful for graphics programming and many other things.

263
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,440
There's also a rather elegant form of this multiplication rule written in terms of the

264
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,200
dot product and the cross product and in some sense, quaternion multiplication subsumes

265
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,640
both of these notions, at least as they appear in three dimensions.

266
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,600
But just as a deeper understanding for complex multiplication comes from understanding its

267
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,760
geometry that multiplying by a complex number involves a combination of scaling and rotating,

268
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,180
you and I are here for the four-dimensional geometry of quaternion multiplication.

269
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,560
And just as the magnitude of a complex number, its distance from zero, is the square root

270
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,880
of the sum of the squares of its component, that same operation gives you the magnitude

271
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,480
of a quaternion.

272
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,640
And multiplying one quaternion, q1, by another, q2, has the effect of scaling q2 by the magnitude

273
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,080
of q1 followed by a very special type of rotation in four dimensions.

274
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,640
And those special 4D rotations, the heart of what we need to understand, correspond

275
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,640
to the hypersphere of quaternions, a distance one from the origin, both in the sense that

276
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,600
the quaternions whose multiplying action is a pure rotation live on that hypersphere,

277
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,560
and in the sense that we can understand this weird 4D action just by following points on

278
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,680
the hypersphere, rather than trying to look at all of the points in the inconceivable

279
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,240
stretches of four-dimensional space.

280
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,160
Analogous to what we did for Linus and Felix, we stereographically project this hypersphere

281
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,680
into 3D space.

282
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,280
This label in the upper right is going to show a given unit quaternion, and this little

283
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:38,760
pink dot will show where that particular quaternion gets projected in our 3D space.

284
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,640
Just as before, we're projecting from the number negative one, which sits on the real

285
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,560
number line that is somehow perpendicular to all of our 3D space and beyond our perception.

286
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:53,900
Just as before, the number one ends up projected straight into the center of our space.

287
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:58,340
And in the same way that i and negative i were fixed in place for Linus, and that the

288
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:04,820
i,j unit circle was fixed in place for Felix, we get a whole sphere passing through i,j

289
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:09,940
and k on that unit hypersphere, which stays in place under the projection.

290
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:15,260
So what we see as a unit sphere in our 3D space represents the only unaltered part of

291
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:19,180
the hypersphere of quaternions getting projected down onto us.

292
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,300
It's something analogous to the equator of a 3D sphere, and it represents all of the

293
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,260
unit quaternions whose real part is zero, what Hamilton would have described as unit

294
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,180
vectors.

295
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,460
The unit quaternions with positive real parts, between zero and one, end up somewhere inside

296
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:41,900
this unit sphere, closer to the number one in our 3D space, which should feel analogous

297
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:47,540
to how the northern hemisphere got mapped inside the unit circle for Felix.

298
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,460
On the other hand, all the unit quaternions with negative real part end up somewhere

299
00:21:51,460 --> 00:22:00,500
outside that unit sphere.

300
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,140
The number negative one is sitting off at the pointed infinity, which you can easily

301
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,060
find by walking in any direction.

302
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,980
Keep in mind, even though we see the projection of some of these quaternions as being closer

303
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,340
or farther from the origin of our 3D space, everything you're looking at represents a

304
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:20,300
unit quaternion, so everything you're looking at really has the same magnitude, the same

305
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,580
distance from the number zero.

306
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,260
And that number zero itself is nowhere to be found in this picture.

307
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,960
Like all other non-unit quaternions, it's invisible to us.

308
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,780
In the same way that for Felix, the circle passing through one, i, negative one, and

309
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:40,700
negative i got projected into a line through the origin.

310
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,420
When we see this line through the origin passing through i and negative i, we should understand

311
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,740
that it really represents a circle.

312
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,820
Likewise, up on the hypersphere, invisible to us, there is a unit sphere passing through

313
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,140
one, i, j, negative one, negative i, and negative j.

314
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,940
And that whole sphere gets projected into the plane that we see passing through one,

315
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,740
i, negative i, j, negative j, and negative one, off at infinity, what you and I might

316
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,660
call the xy plane.

317
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,900
In general, any plane that you see here really represents the projection of a sphere somewhere

318
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,580
up on the hypersphere, which passes through the number negative one.

319
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:24,300
Now the action of taking a unit quaternion and multiplying it by any other quaternion

320
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,980
from the left can be thought of in terms of two separate 2D rotations happening perpendicular

321
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,540
to and in sync with each other in a way that could only ever be possible in four dimensions.

322
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,900
As a first example, let's look at multiplication by i.

323
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,300
We already know what this does to the circle that passes through one and i, which we see

324
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,060
as a line.

325
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:53,420
One goes to i, i goes to negative one, off at infinity, negative one comes back around

326
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,620
to negative i, and negative i goes to one.

327
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,900
Remember, just like what line is saw, all of this is the stereographic projection of

328
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,260
a 90 degree rotation.

329
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,100
Now look at the circle passing through j and k, which is in a sense perpendicular to the

330
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,460
circle passing through one and i.

331
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,180
Now it might feel weird to talk about two circles being perpendicular to each other,

332
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,340
especially when they have the same center, the same radius, and they don't touch each

333
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,780
other at all, but nothing could be more natural in four dimensions.

334
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:27,500
You can think of the action of i on this perpendicular circle as obeying a certain right hand rule.

335
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,740
If you'll excuse the intrusion of my ghostly green screen hand into our otherwise pristine

336
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,180
platonic mathematical stage, you let that thumb of your right hand point from the number

337
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,500
one to i and you curl your fingers.

338
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:43,780
The jk circle will rotate in the direction of that curl.

339
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,780
How much?

340
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:50,780
Well, by the same amount as the one i circle rotates, which is 90 degrees in this case.

341
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:56,100
This is what I meant by two rotations perpendicular to and in sync with each other.

342
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:08,100
So j goes to k, k goes to negative j, negative j goes to negative k, and negative k goes

343
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,240
to j.

344
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,620
This gives us a little table for what the number i does to the other quaternions.

345
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,860
But I want this not to be something that you memorize, but something that you could close

346
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,260
your eyes and you could really see.

347
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:27,020
Computationally, if you know what a quaternion does to the numbers one, i, j, and k, you

348
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,300
know what it does to any arbitrary quaternion, since multiplication distributes nicely.

349
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:37,860
In the language of linear algebra, one, i, j, and k form a basis of our four-dimensional

350
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:42,860
space, so knowing what our transformation does to them gives us the full information about

351
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,060
what it does to all of space.

352
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,500
Geometrically, a four-dimensional creature would be able to look at those two perpendicular

353
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,900
rotations that I just described and understand that they lock you into one and only one rigid

354
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,820
motion for the hypersphere.

355
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,100
We might lack the intuitions of such a hypothetical creature, but we can maybe try to get close.

356
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:07,380
Here's what the action of repeatedly multiplying by i looks like on our stereographic projection

357
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,900
of the i, j, k sphere.

358
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,100
It gets rotated into what we see as a plane, then gets rotated further back to where it

359
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:19,340
used to be, though the orientation is all reversed now, then it gets rotated again into

360
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:25,260
what we see as a plane, and after the fourth iteration it ends up right back where it started.

361
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,540
As another example, think of a quaternion like q equals negative square root of two

362
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,300
over two plus square root of two over two times i, which, if we pull up a picture of

363
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:41,380
a complex plane, is a 135 degree rotation away from one in the direction of i.

364
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:46,260
Under our projection, we see this along the line from one to i somewhere outside the unit

365
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,340
sphere.

366
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,740
If that sounds weird, just remember how Linus would have seen this same number.

367
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:56,980
The action of multiplying this q by all other quaternions will look to us like dragging the

368
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,900
point at one all the way to this projected version of q, while the jk circle gets rotated

369
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:10,580
135 degrees, according to our right hand rule.

370
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:13,780
Multiplication by any other quaternion is completely similar.

371
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,920
For example, let's see what it looks like for j to act on other quaternions by multiplication

372
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,420
from the left.

373
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,700
The circle, through one and j, which we see projected as a line through the origin, gets

374
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,180
rotated 90 degrees, dragging one up to j.

375
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:38,540
So j times one is one, and j times j is negative one.

376
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,420
The circle perpendicular to that one, passing through i and k, gets rotated 90 degrees,

377
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:48,740
according to this right hand rule, where you point your thumb from one to j.

378
00:27:48,740 --> 00:28:02,180
So j times i is negative k, and j times k is i.

379
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:06,900
In general, for any other unit quaternion you see somewhere in space, start by drawing

380
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,060
the unit circle passing through one, q, and negative one, which we see in our projection

381
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,420
as a line through the origin.

382
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:18,980
Then draw the circle perpendicular to that one on what we see as the unit sphere.

383
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:24,180
You rotate the first circle so that one ends up where q was, and rotate the perpendicular

384
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:40,600
circle by the same amount according to the right hand rule.

385
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,260
One thing worth noticing here is that order of multiplication matters.

386
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,420
It's not, as mathematicians would say, commutative.

387
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,580
For example, i times j is k, which you might think of in terms of i acting on the quaternion

388
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,980
j, rotating it up to k.

389
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,780
But if you think of j as acting on i, j times i, it rotates i to negative k.

390
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,400
In fact, commutativity, this ability to swap the order of multiplication, is a way more

391
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,260
special property than a lot of people realize.

392
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,940
And most groups of actions on some space don't have it.

393
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,900
Things like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot.

394
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,860
Or how rotating a cube about the z-axis and then about the x-axis gives a different final

395
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:29,420
state from rotating it about the x-axis then about the z-axis.

396
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:33,580
And last, as one final but rather important point, so far I've shown you how to think

397
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,860
about quaternions as acting by left multiplication, where when you read an expression like i times

398
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,020
j, you think of i as a kind of function morphing all of space, and j is just one of the points

399
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,020
that it's acting on.

400
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:50,380
But you can also think of them as a different sort of action, by multiplying from the right,

401
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,780
where in this expression, j would be acting on i.

402
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:57,060
In that case, the rule for multiplication is very similar.

403
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,420
It's still the case that 1 goes to j and j goes to negative 1, etc.

404
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,340
But instead of applying the right hand rule to the circle perpendicular to the 1j circle,

405
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,180
you would use your left hand.

406
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:12,820
So either way, i times j is equal to k, but you can either think about this with your

407
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:18,980
right hand curling the number j to the number k, as your thumb points from 1 to i, or as

408
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,460
your left hand curling i to k, as its thumb points from 1 to j.

409
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:30,180
Understanding this left hand rule for multiplication from the other side will be extremely useful

410
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,700
for understanding how unit quaternions describe rotation in three dimensions.

411
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,700
And so far, it's probably not clear how exactly quaternions do describe 3D rotation.

412
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,420
I mean, if you consider one of these actions on the unit sphere, passing through i, j, and

413
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:49,980
k, it doesn't leave that sphere in place, it morphs it out of position, so the way that

414
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,140
this works is slightly more complicated than a single quaternion product.

415
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,940
It involves a process called conjugation, and I'll make a full follow on video all

416
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,140
about it so that we have the time to go through some examples.

417
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,820
In the meantime, for more information on the story of quaternions and their relation

418
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,260
to orientation in 3D space, Quanta, a mathematical publication I'm sure a lot of you are familiar

419
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,220
with, just put out a post in a kind of loose conjunction with this video, link in the description.

420
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:21,220
If you enjoyed this, consider sharing it with some friends, and if you felt like the narrative

421
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:26,020
structure here was actually helpful for understanding, maybe reassure those friends who would be

422
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,620
turned off by a large time stamp that good math is actually worth the time.

423
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,660
And many thanks to the patrons among you, I actually spent way longer than I care to

424
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,140
admit on this project, so your patience and support is especially appreciated this time

425
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,580
around.
