0	7120	Imagine you have a weighted coin, so the probability of flipping heads it might not
7120	18640	be 50-50 exactly, it could be 20%, or maybe 90%, or 0%, or 31.41592%.
18640	20840	The point is that you just don't know.
20840	25120	But imagine that you flip this coin ten different times, and seven of those times it comes up
25120	26120	heads.
26120	30880	Do you think that the underlying weight of this coin is such that each flip has a 70%
30880	32800	chance of coming up heads?
32800	37680	If I were to ask you, hey, what's the probability that the true probability of flipping heads
37680	41960	is 0.7, what would you say?
41960	44920	This is a pretty weird question, and for two reasons.
44920	49840	First of all, it's asking about a probability of a probability, as in the value we don't
49840	55080	know is itself some kind of long-run frequency for a random event, which frankly is hard
55080	56480	to think about.
56480	59960	But the more pressing weirdness comes from asking about probabilities in the setting
59960	62760	of continuous values.
62760	67680	Let's give this unknown probability of flipping heads some kind of name, like h.
67680	73360	Keep in mind that h could be any real number from 0 up to 1, ranging from a coin that always
73360	79040	flips tails, up to one that always flips heads, and everything in between.
79040	84720	So if I ask, hey, what's the probability that h is precisely 0.7, as opposed to say
84720	92600	0.7000001, or any other nearby value, well there's going to be a strong possibility for
92600	94940	paradox if we're not careful.
94940	98720	It feels like no matter how small the answer to this question, it just wouldn't be small
98720	100040	enough.
100040	105360	If every specific value within some range, all uncountably infinitely many of them, has
105360	110000	a non-zero probability, well even if that probability was minuscule, adding them all
110000	115960	up to get the total probability of any one of these values will blow up to infinity.
115960	120080	On the other hand though, if all of these probabilities are 0, aside from the fact that
120080	125440	that now gives you no useful information about the coin, the total sum of those probabilities
125440	128720	would be 0 when it should be 1.
128720	134160	After all, this weight of the coin h is something, so the probability of it being any one of
134160	137520	these values should add up to 1.
137520	145240	So if these values can't all be non-zero, and they can't all be 0, what do you do?
145240	148560	Where we're going with this, by the way, is that I'd like to talk about the very practical
148560	153320	question of using data to create meaningful answers to these sorts of probabilities of
153320	155760	probabilities questions.
155760	159480	But for this video, let's take a moment to appreciate how to work with probabilities
159480	169840	over continuous values and resolve this apparent paradox.
169840	174640	The key is not to focus on individual values, but ranges of values.
174640	179280	For example, we might make these buckets to represent the probability that h is between
179280	183280	say 0.8 and 0.85.
183280	187320	Also and this is more important than it might seem, rather than thinking of the height of
187320	192320	each of these bars as representing the probability, think of the area of each one as representing
192320	194160	that probability.
194160	198040	Where exactly those areas come from is something that we'll answer later.
198040	202240	For right now, just know that, in principle, there's some answer to the probability of
202240	205080	h sitting inside one of these ranges.
205080	209520	Our task right now is to take the answers to these very coarse-grained questions, and
209520	215680	to get a more exact understanding of the distribution at the level of each individual input.
215680	220280	The natural thing to do would be to consider finer and finer buckets, and when you do, the
220280	225320	smaller probability of falling into any one of them is accounted for in the thinner width
225320	229800	of each of these bars, while the heights are going to stay roughly the same.
229800	233800	That's important because it means that as you take this process to the limit, you approach
233800	236000	some kind of smooth curve.
236000	240880	So even though all of the individual probabilities of falling into any one particular bucket
240880	246440	will approach zero, the overall shape of the distribution is preserved and even refined
246440	249120	in this limit.
249120	253480	If on the other hand we had let the heights of the bars represent probabilities, everything
253480	260480	would have gone to zero.
260480	264480	So in the limit, we would have just had a flat line giving no information about the overall
264480	267520	shape of the distribution.
267520	271440	So wonderful, letting area represent probability helps solve this problem.
271440	276480	But let me ask you, if the y-axis no longer represents probability, what exactly are the
276480	278280	units here?
278280	283480	Since probability sits in the area of these bars, or width times height, the height represents
283480	289240	a kind of probability per unit in the x direction, what's known in the business as a probability
289240	290640	density.
290640	294680	The other thing to keep in mind is that the total area of all these bars has to equal
294680	297200	one at every level of the process.
297200	302280	That's something that has to be true for any valid probability distribution.
302280	305800	The idea of probability density is actually really clever when you step back to think
305800	308520	about it, as you take things to the limit.
308520	312920	Even if there's all sorts of paradoxes associated with assigning a probability to each of these
312920	318640	uncountably infinitely many values of h between zero and one, there's no problem if we associate
318640	323200	a probability density to each one of them, giving what's known as a probability density
323200	326560	function, or PDF for short.
326560	330800	Any time you see a PDF in the wild, the way to interpret it is that the probability of
330800	336840	your random variable lying between two values equals the area under this curve between those
336840	338200	values.
338200	342560	So for example, what's the probability of getting any one very specific number, like
342560	343560	0.7?
343560	349120	Well, the area of an infinitely thin slice is zero, so it's zero.
349120	351520	What's the probability of all of them put together?
352040	354720	Well, the area under the full curve is one.
354720	357840	You see, paradox sidestepped.
357840	360800	And the way that it's been sidestepped is a bit subtle.
360800	365520	In normal finite settings, like rolling a die or drawing a card, the probability that
365520	370840	a random value falls into a given collection of possibilities is simply the sum of the
370840	373960	probabilities of being any one of them.
373960	378640	This feels very intuitive, it's even true in a countably infinite context, but to deal
378640	382120	with the continuum, the rules themselves have shifted.
382120	387080	The probability of falling into a range of values is no longer the sum of the probabilities
387080	389160	of each individual value.
389160	395040	Instead, probabilities associated with ranges are the fundamental primitive objects, and
395040	399160	the only sense in which it's meaningful to talk about an individual value here is to
399160	402240	think of it as a range of width zero.
402240	406560	If the idea of the rules changing between a finite setting and a continuous one feels
406560	410600	unsettling, well, you'll be happy to know that mathematicians are way ahead of you.
410600	414920	There's a field of math called measure theory, which helps to unite these two settings and
414920	419920	make rigorous the idea of associating numbers like probabilities to various subsets of all
419920	424280	possibilities in a way that combines and distributes nicely.
424280	427600	For example, let's say you're in a setting where you have a random number that equals
427600	433200	zero with 50% probability, and the rest of the time it's some positive number according
433200	436860	to a distribution that looks like half of a bell curve.
436860	441320	This is an awkward middle ground between a finite context, where a single value has
441320	446400	a nonzero probability, and a continuous one, where probabilities are found according to
446400	449640	areas under the appropriate density function.
449640	453040	This is the sort of thing that measure theory handles very smoothly.
453040	456880	I mentioned this mainly for the especially curious viewer, and you can find more reading
456880	461080	material in the description.
461080	464840	It's a pretty common rule of thumb that if you find yourself using a sum in a discrete
464840	469880	context, then use an integral in the continuous context, which is the tool from calculus that
469880	472440	we use to find areas under curves.
472440	475840	In fact, you could argue this video would be way shorter if I just said that at the
475840	477840	front and called it good.
477840	482000	For my part, though, I always found it a little unsatisfying to do this blindly without thinking
482000	484200	through what it really means.
484200	488920	And in fact, if you really dig into the theoretical underpinnings of integrals, what you'd find
488920	493520	is that in addition to the way that it's defined in a typical intro calculus class,
493520	497800	there is a separate, more powerful definition that's based on measure theory, this formal
497800	501200	foundation of probability.
501200	505480	If I look back to when I first learned probability, I definitely remember grappling with this
505480	509880	weird idea that in continuous settings, like random variables that are real numbers or
509880	514560	throwing a dart at a dartboard, you have a bunch of outcomes that are possible, and yet
514560	520280	each one has a probability of zero, and somehow altogether they have a probability of one.
520280	525360	Now, one step of coming to terms with this is to realize that possibility is better tied
525360	530440	to probability density than probability, but just swapping out sums of one for integrals
530440	533200	of the others never quite scratched the itch for me.
533200	537680	I remember that it only really clicked when I realized that the rules for combining probabilities
537680	541480	of different sets were not quite what I thought they were, and there was simply a different
541480	544680	axiom system underlying it all.
544680	549360	But anyway, steering away from the theory somewhere back in the loose direction of application,
549360	553120	look back to our original question about the coin with an unknown weight.
553120	557620	What we've learned here is that the right question to ask is, what's the probability
557620	563600	density function that describes this value h after seeing the outcomes of a few tosses?
563600	568640	If you can find that PDF, you can use it to answer questions like, what's the probability
568640	573840	that the true probability of flipping heads falls between 0.6 and 0.8?
573840	576040	To find that PDF, join me in the next part.
