1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Imagine you have a weighted coin, so the probability of flipping heads it might not

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:18,640
be 50-50 exactly, it could be 20%, or maybe 90%, or 0%, or 31.41592%.

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,840
The point is that you just don't know.

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,120
But imagine that you flip this coin ten different times, and seven of those times it comes up

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,120
heads.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:30,880
Do you think that the underlying weight of this coin is such that each flip has a 70%

7
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
chance of coming up heads?

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,680
If I were to ask you, hey, what's the probability that the true probability of flipping heads

9
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,960
is 0.7, what would you say?

10
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,920
This is a pretty weird question, and for two reasons.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,840
First of all, it's asking about a probability of a probability, as in the value we don't

12
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,080
know is itself some kind of long-run frequency for a random event, which frankly is hard

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,480
to think about.

14
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,960
But the more pressing weirdness comes from asking about probabilities in the setting

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,760
of continuous values.

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,680
Let's give this unknown probability of flipping heads some kind of name, like h.

17
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,360
Keep in mind that h could be any real number from 0 up to 1, ranging from a coin that always

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,040
flips tails, up to one that always flips heads, and everything in between.

19
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,720
So if I ask, hey, what's the probability that h is precisely 0.7, as opposed to say

20
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,600
0.7000001, or any other nearby value, well there's going to be a strong possibility for

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,940
paradox if we're not careful.

22
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,720
It feels like no matter how small the answer to this question, it just wouldn't be small

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,040
enough.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:45,360
If every specific value within some range, all uncountably infinitely many of them, has

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,000
a non-zero probability, well even if that probability was minuscule, adding them all

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,960
up to get the total probability of any one of these values will blow up to infinity.

27
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,080
On the other hand though, if all of these probabilities are 0, aside from the fact that

28
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:05,440
that now gives you no useful information about the coin, the total sum of those probabilities

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,720
would be 0 when it should be 1.

30
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,160
After all, this weight of the coin h is something, so the probability of it being any one of

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,520
these values should add up to 1.

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:25,240
So if these values can't all be non-zero, and they can't all be 0, what do you do?

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,560
Where we're going with this, by the way, is that I'd like to talk about the very practical

34
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,320
question of using data to create meaningful answers to these sorts of probabilities of

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,760
probabilities questions.

36
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,480
But for this video, let's take a moment to appreciate how to work with probabilities

37
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:49,840
over continuous values and resolve this apparent paradox.

38
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,640
The key is not to focus on individual values, but ranges of values.

39
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,280
For example, we might make these buckets to represent the probability that h is between

40
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,280
say 0.8 and 0.85.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,320
Also and this is more important than it might seem, rather than thinking of the height of

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:12,320
each of these bars as representing the probability, think of the area of each one as representing

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,160
that probability.

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,040
Where exactly those areas come from is something that we'll answer later.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,240
For right now, just know that, in principle, there's some answer to the probability of

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,080
h sitting inside one of these ranges.

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,520
Our task right now is to take the answers to these very coarse-grained questions, and

48
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:35,680
to get a more exact understanding of the distribution at the level of each individual input.

49
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,280
The natural thing to do would be to consider finer and finer buckets, and when you do, the

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,320
smaller probability of falling into any one of them is accounted for in the thinner width

51
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,800
of each of these bars, while the heights are going to stay roughly the same.

52
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,800
That's important because it means that as you take this process to the limit, you approach

53
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,000
some kind of smooth curve.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,880
So even though all of the individual probabilities of falling into any one particular bucket

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,440
will approach zero, the overall shape of the distribution is preserved and even refined

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,120
in this limit.

57
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,480
If on the other hand we had let the heights of the bars represent probabilities, everything

58
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:20,480
would have gone to zero.

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,480
So in the limit, we would have just had a flat line giving no information about the overall

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,520
shape of the distribution.

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,440
So wonderful, letting area represent probability helps solve this problem.

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,480
But let me ask you, if the y-axis no longer represents probability, what exactly are the

63
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,280
units here?

64
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,480
Since probability sits in the area of these bars, or width times height, the height represents

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,240
a kind of probability per unit in the x direction, what's known in the business as a probability

66
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,640
density.

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,680
The other thing to keep in mind is that the total area of all these bars has to equal

68
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,200
one at every level of the process.

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,280
That's something that has to be true for any valid probability distribution.

70
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,800
The idea of probability density is actually really clever when you step back to think

71
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,520
about it, as you take things to the limit.

72
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,920
Even if there's all sorts of paradoxes associated with assigning a probability to each of these

73
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:18,640
uncountably infinitely many values of h between zero and one, there's no problem if we associate

74
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,200
a probability density to each one of them, giving what's known as a probability density

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,560
function, or PDF for short.

76
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,800
Any time you see a PDF in the wild, the way to interpret it is that the probability of

77
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,840
your random variable lying between two values equals the area under this curve between those

78
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
values.

79
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,560
So for example, what's the probability of getting any one very specific number, like

80
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,560
0.7?

81
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:49,120
Well, the area of an infinitely thin slice is zero, so it's zero.

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,520
What's the probability of all of them put together?

83
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,720
Well, the area under the full curve is one.

84
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
You see, paradox sidestepped.

85
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,800
And the way that it's been sidestepped is a bit subtle.

86
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,520
In normal finite settings, like rolling a die or drawing a card, the probability that

87
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,840
a random value falls into a given collection of possibilities is simply the sum of the

88
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,960
probabilities of being any one of them.

89
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,640
This feels very intuitive, it's even true in a countably infinite context, but to deal

90
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,120
with the continuum, the rules themselves have shifted.

91
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:27,080
The probability of falling into a range of values is no longer the sum of the probabilities

92
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,160
of each individual value.

93
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,040
Instead, probabilities associated with ranges are the fundamental primitive objects, and

94
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,160
the only sense in which it's meaningful to talk about an individual value here is to

95
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,240
think of it as a range of width zero.

96
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,560
If the idea of the rules changing between a finite setting and a continuous one feels

97
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,600
unsettling, well, you'll be happy to know that mathematicians are way ahead of you.

98
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,920
There's a field of math called measure theory, which helps to unite these two settings and

99
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,920
make rigorous the idea of associating numbers like probabilities to various subsets of all

100
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,280
possibilities in a way that combines and distributes nicely.

101
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,600
For example, let's say you're in a setting where you have a random number that equals

102
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:13,200
zero with 50% probability, and the rest of the time it's some positive number according

103
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,860
to a distribution that looks like half of a bell curve.

104
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,320
This is an awkward middle ground between a finite context, where a single value has

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,400
a nonzero probability, and a continuous one, where probabilities are found according to

106
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,640
areas under the appropriate density function.

107
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,040
This is the sort of thing that measure theory handles very smoothly.

108
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,880
I mentioned this mainly for the especially curious viewer, and you can find more reading

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,080
material in the description.

110
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,840
It's a pretty common rule of thumb that if you find yourself using a sum in a discrete

111
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,880
context, then use an integral in the continuous context, which is the tool from calculus that

112
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,440
we use to find areas under curves.

113
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,840
In fact, you could argue this video would be way shorter if I just said that at the

114
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
front and called it good.

115
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,000
For my part, though, I always found it a little unsatisfying to do this blindly without thinking

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,200
through what it really means.

117
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,920
And in fact, if you really dig into the theoretical underpinnings of integrals, what you'd find

118
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,520
is that in addition to the way that it's defined in a typical intro calculus class,

119
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,800
there is a separate, more powerful definition that's based on measure theory, this formal

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,200
foundation of probability.

121
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,480
If I look back to when I first learned probability, I definitely remember grappling with this

122
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,880
weird idea that in continuous settings, like random variables that are real numbers or

123
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,560
throwing a dart at a dartboard, you have a bunch of outcomes that are possible, and yet

124
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,280
each one has a probability of zero, and somehow altogether they have a probability of one.

125
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:45,360
Now, one step of coming to terms with this is to realize that possibility is better tied

126
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,440
to probability density than probability, but just swapping out sums of one for integrals

127
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,200
of the others never quite scratched the itch for me.

128
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,680
I remember that it only really clicked when I realized that the rules for combining probabilities

129
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,480
of different sets were not quite what I thought they were, and there was simply a different

130
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,680
axiom system underlying it all.

131
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,360
But anyway, steering away from the theory somewhere back in the loose direction of application,

132
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,120
look back to our original question about the coin with an unknown weight.

133
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,620
What we've learned here is that the right question to ask is, what's the probability

134
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:23,600
density function that describes this value h after seeing the outcomes of a few tosses?

135
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,640
If you can find that PDF, you can use it to answer questions like, what's the probability

136
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,840
that the true probability of flipping heads falls between 0.6 and 0.8?

137
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,040
To find that PDF, join me in the next part.
