00:00.000 --> 00:05.800
What you are looking at right now is something called quaternion multiplication, or rather

00:05.800 --> 00:10.560
you're looking at a certain representation of a specific motion happening on a four-dimensional

00:10.560 --> 00:16.040
sphere being represented in our three-dimensional space, one which you'll understand by the

00:16.040 --> 00:22.080
end of this video.

00:22.080 --> 00:26.240
Quaternions are an absolutely fascinating and often underappreciated number system from

00:26.240 --> 00:27.440
math.

00:27.440 --> 00:32.000
Just as complex numbers are a two-dimensional extension of the real numbers, quaternions

00:32.000 --> 00:35.520
are a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers.

00:35.520 --> 00:39.640
But they're not just playful mathematical shenanigans, they have a surprisingly pragmatic

00:39.640 --> 00:45.120
utility for describing rotation in three dimensions, and even for quantum mechanics.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.240
The story of their discovery is also quite famous in math.

00:48.240 --> 00:52.640
The Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton spent much of his life seeking a three-dimensional

00:52.640 --> 00:56.000
number system, analogous to the complex numbers.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.520
And as the story goes, his son would ask him every morning whether or not he had figured

00:59.520 --> 01:03.400
out how to divide triples, and he would always say, no, not yet.

01:03.400 --> 01:08.960
But on October 16th, 1843, while crossing the Broome Bridge in Dublin, he realized with

01:08.960 --> 01:13.360
a supposed flash of insight that what he needed was not to add a single dimension to the complex

01:13.360 --> 01:19.720
numbers, but to add two more imaginary dimensions, three imaginary dimensions describing space

01:19.720 --> 01:24.120
and the real numbers, sitting perpendicular to that in some kind of fourth dimension.

01:24.120 --> 01:28.440
He carved the crucial equation describing these three imaginary units into the bridge,

01:28.440 --> 01:32.280
which today bears a plaque in his honor showing that equation.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.520
Now you have to understand, our modern notion of vectors with their dot product and the

01:36.520 --> 01:40.920
cross product and things like that didn't really exist in Hamilton's time, at least

01:40.920 --> 01:42.880
not in a standardized form.

01:42.880 --> 01:47.840
So after his discovery, he pushed hard for quaternions to be the primary language with

01:47.840 --> 01:52.440
which we teach students to describe three-dimensional space, even forming an official quaternion

01:52.440 --> 01:54.920
society to proselytize his discovery.

01:54.920 --> 01:59.520
Now, unfortunately, this was balanced with mathematicians on the other side of the fence,

01:59.520 --> 02:04.440
who believed that the confusing notion of quaternion multiplication was not necessary for describing

02:04.440 --> 02:09.200
three dimensions, resulting in some truly hilarious, old-timey trash talk legitimately

02:09.200 --> 02:10.360
calling them evil.

02:10.360 --> 02:14.480
It's even believed that the Mad Hatter scene from Alice in Wonderland, whose author you

02:14.480 --> 02:19.160
may know was an Oxford mathematician, was written in reference to quaternions, that

02:19.160 --> 02:23.680
the chaotic table placement changes were mocking their multiplication, and that certain quotes

02:23.680 --> 02:27.120
were referencing their non-commutative nature.

02:27.120 --> 02:31.480
Fast forward about a century, and the computing industry gave quaternions a resurgence among

02:31.480 --> 02:37.080
programmers who work with graphics and robotics and anything involving orientation in 3D space.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.240
And this is because they give an elegant way to describe and compute 3D rotations, which

02:42.240 --> 02:46.320
is computationally more efficient than other methods, and which also avoids a lot of the

02:46.320 --> 02:49.280
numerical errors that arise in these other methods.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.880
The 20th century also brought quaternions some more love from a completely different direction,

02:53.880 --> 02:54.880
quantum mechanics.

02:54.880 --> 02:59.680
You see, the special actions that quaternions describe in four dimensions are actually quite

02:59.680 --> 03:03.880
relevant to the way that two-state systems, like spin of an electron or the polarization

03:03.880 --> 03:07.680
of a photon, are described mathematically.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.960
What I'll show you here is a way to visualize quaternions in their full four-dimensional

03:11.960 --> 03:12.960
glory.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.800
I would surprise me if this approach was fully original, but I can say that it's certainly

03:16.800 --> 03:21.480
not the standard way to teach quaternions, and that the specific four-dimensional right-hand

03:21.480 --> 03:26.240
rule image that I'd like to build up to is something that I haven't really seen elsewhere.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.800
Building up an understanding for this visual will take us meaningful time, but once you

03:29.800 --> 03:34.280
have it, there is a very natural and satisfying intuition for how to think about quaternion

03:34.280 --> 03:35.780
multiplication.

03:35.780 --> 03:40.160
It won't be until the next video that I show you how exactly quaternions describe orientation

03:40.160 --> 03:44.240
in three dimensions, which is, for some people, the whole reason we care about it, but once

03:44.240 --> 03:48.760
we're able to go at it armed with the image of what they're doing to a 4D hypersphere,

03:48.760 --> 03:52.920
there's a pleasing understanding to be had for the otherwise opaque formulas characterizing

03:52.920 --> 03:55.480
this relationship.

03:55.480 --> 03:59.980
The structure here will be to start by imagining teaching complex numbers to someone who only

03:59.980 --> 04:04.720
understands one dimension, then describing 3D rotations to someone who only understands

04:04.720 --> 04:10.040
two dimensions, and ultimately to represent what quaternions are doing up in four dimensions

04:10.040 --> 04:17.520
within the constraints of our 3D space.

04:17.520 --> 04:22.160
Our first character is Linus the Linedlander, whose mind can only grasp the one-dimensional

04:22.160 --> 04:24.960
geometry of lines in the algebra of real numbers.

04:24.960 --> 04:29.240
We're going to try to describe complex numbers to Linus, and it's really important for you

04:29.240 --> 04:33.280
to empathize with him as much as you can during this, because in a few minutes, you're going

04:33.280 --> 04:34.960
to be in his shoes.

04:34.960 --> 04:38.760
On the one hand, you could define complex numbers purely algebraically.

04:38.760 --> 04:43.480
You say each one is expressed as some real number plus some other real number times i,

04:43.480 --> 04:48.120
where i is a newly invented constant whose defining property is that i times i equals

04:48.120 --> 04:49.520
negative one.

04:49.520 --> 04:54.160
Then you say to Linus, to multiply two complex numbers, you just use the distributive property,

04:54.160 --> 05:01.480
what many people learn in school as foil, and you apply this rule that i times i equals

05:01.480 --> 05:04.440
negative one to simplify things down further.

05:04.440 --> 05:08.440
And that's fine, that totally works, and the standard textbook way to introduce quaternions

05:08.440 --> 05:12.440
is analogous to this, showing the algebraic rules and calling it done.

05:12.440 --> 05:16.240
But I think something is missing if we don't at least try to show Linus the geometry of

05:16.240 --> 05:20.760
complex numbers, and what complex multiplication looks like, since the problems in math and

05:20.760 --> 05:26.320
physics where complex numbers are shockingly useful often leverage this spatial intuition.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.800
You and I, who understand two dimensions, might think of it like this.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.120
When you multiply two complex numbers, z times w, you can think of z as a sort of function

05:35.120 --> 05:40.000
acting on w, rotating and stretching it in some way.

05:40.000 --> 05:43.800
I like to think of this by broadening the view and asking, what does z do to the entire

05:43.800 --> 05:44.800
plane?

05:44.800 --> 05:48.280
And you can think of that bird's eye view action by imagining using one hand to fix

05:48.280 --> 05:53.880
the number zero in place, and using another hand to drag the point at one up to z, since

05:53.880 --> 05:58.200
anything times zero is zero, and anything times one is itself.

05:58.200 --> 06:02.120
And in two dimensions, there is one and only one stretching rotating action on the plane

06:02.120 --> 06:03.600
that'll do this.

06:03.600 --> 06:07.360
This is also how I'll have you thinking about quaternion multiplication later on, where

06:07.360 --> 06:11.240
the number on the left acts as a kind of function to the one on the right.

06:11.240 --> 06:15.760
And we'll understand this function by seeing how it acts by transforming space, although

06:15.760 --> 06:23.320
instead of rotating 2D space, it does a sort of double rotation in 4D space.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.920
By the way, if you want to review thinking about complex numbers as a kind of action,

06:26.920 --> 06:30.720
a good warm up for this video might be the one I did on e to the pi i explained with

06:30.720 --> 06:32.800
introductory group theory.

06:32.800 --> 06:36.480
The Linus the Linelander is pretty comfortable with the idea of stretching, that's what

06:36.480 --> 06:39.160
multiplication by real numbers looks like.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.520
Maybe it's a little weird for him to think about stretching in multiple dimensions, but

06:42.520 --> 06:44.520
it's not fundamentally different.

06:44.520 --> 06:49.960
The difficult thing to communicate to Linus is rotation, specifically focus on the unit

06:49.960 --> 06:55.080
circle of the complex plane, all the numbers a distance one from zero, since multiplication

06:55.080 --> 06:58.320
by these numbers corresponds to pure rotation.

06:58.320 --> 07:04.920
How would you explain to Linus the look and the feel of multiplying by these numbers?

07:04.920 --> 07:09.200
At first, that might seem impossible, I mean rotation is just such an intrinsically two

07:09.200 --> 07:15.920
dimensional idea, but on the other hand, rotation involves only one degree of freedom, a single

07:15.920 --> 07:20.240
number, the angle, specifies a given rotation uniquely.

07:20.240 --> 07:24.880
So in principle, it should be possible to associate the set of all rotations to the

07:24.880 --> 07:28.640
one dimensional continuum that is Linus's world.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.760
And there are many ways you could do this, but the one I'm going to show you is what's

07:31.760 --> 07:36.720
called a stereographic projection, it's a special way to map a circle onto a line, or

07:36.720 --> 07:46.280
a sphere into a plane, or even a 4D hypersphere into 3D space.

07:46.280 --> 07:51.720
For every point on the unit circle, draw a line from negative one through that point,

07:51.720 --> 07:55.720
and wherever it intersects the vertical line through the circle center, that's where the

07:55.720 --> 07:59.640
point of the circle gets projected.

07:59.640 --> 08:05.520
So for example, the point at one gets projected into the center of the line, the point i actually

08:05.520 --> 08:10.760
stays fixed in place, as does negative i.

08:10.760 --> 08:16.200
All of the points on that 90 degree arc between one and i will get projected somewhere in

08:16.200 --> 08:21.560
the interval between where one landed and where i landed, as you continue farther around

08:22.400 --> 08:26.400
the circle on the arc between i and negative one, the projected points end up farther

08:26.400 --> 08:28.760
and farther away at an increasing rate.

08:28.760 --> 08:33.120
Similarly, if you come around the other way towards negative one, the projected points

08:33.120 --> 08:36.760
end up farther and farther on the other end of the line.

08:36.760 --> 08:41.360
This line of projected points is what we show to Linus, labeling a few key points, like

08:41.360 --> 08:44.800
one and i and negative one all for reference.

08:44.800 --> 08:49.280
Technically, the point at negative one has no projection under this map, since the tangent

08:49.320 --> 08:52.960
line to the circle at that point never crosses the vertical line.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.000
But what we say is that negative one ends up at the point at infinity.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.720
This is a special point you imagine adding to the line, where you would approach it,

09:00.720 --> 09:04.880
if you walk infinitely far along the line in either direction.

09:04.880 --> 09:09.040
Now it's important to remember, and to remind Linus, that what he's seeing is only the

09:09.040 --> 09:13.520
complex numbers that are a distance one from the origin, the unit circle.

09:13.520 --> 09:19.000
Linus doesn't see most numbers, like zero, or one plus i, or negative two minus i, but

09:19.000 --> 09:23.720
that's okay, because right now we just want to describe complex numbers z, where multiplying

09:23.720 --> 09:31.200
by z has the effect of a pure rotation, so he only needs to understand the unit circle.

09:31.200 --> 09:36.560
For example, when we take the number i and multiply it by any other complex number w,

09:36.560 --> 09:40.440
the effect is to rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise.

09:40.440 --> 09:44.800
And when we apply this action to the circle, being projected down to the line for Linus,

09:44.800 --> 09:45.800
what does he see?

09:45.800 --> 09:50.660
Well, it's a bit of a strange morphing action on the line, one which I want you to become

09:50.660 --> 09:53.520
familiar with for something we'll see later on.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.240
It's easiest to understand by following a few key reference points.

09:57.240 --> 10:04.000
i times one is i, so that means the number one should move up to i.

10:04.000 --> 10:11.480
i times i is negative one, so the point at i slides off to infinity.

10:11.480 --> 10:16.200
i times negative one is equal to negative i, so that point at infinity kind of comes

10:16.200 --> 10:20.360
back around from the bottom to the position one unit below the center.

10:20.360 --> 10:26.520
And i times negative i is one, so that point at negative i slides up to one.

10:26.520 --> 10:29.960
Even though this is kind of a weird motion, it lets us communicate some important ideas

10:29.960 --> 10:31.160
to Linus.

10:31.160 --> 10:35.840
For example, multiplying by i four times, which corresponds to rotating by 90 degrees

10:35.840 --> 10:39.160
four times in a row, gets us back to where we started.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.800
i to the fourth equals one.

10:40.800 --> 10:45.080
Here, to get more of a feel for things, let me just show the circle rotated at various

10:45.080 --> 10:46.080
different angles.

10:46.080 --> 10:50.240
On both the left and the right half of the screen here, I'm putting a hand on the point

10:50.240 --> 10:55.000
that started at the number one to help us and to help Linus keep track of the overall

10:55.000 --> 11:06.920
motion.

11:06.920 --> 11:12.040
Next let's introduce Felix the Flatlander, who only understands two-dimensional geometry.

11:12.040 --> 11:18.280
Imagine trying to explain rotations of a sphere to Felix.

11:18.280 --> 11:22.000
In the spirit of transitioning from complex numbers to quaternions, let's extend the

11:22.000 --> 11:26.560
complex numbers with its horizontal axis of real numbers and its vertical axis of imaginary

11:26.560 --> 11:32.240
numbers with a third axis, defined by some newly invented constant, J, sitting one unit

11:32.240 --> 11:36.000
away from zero, perpendicular to the complex plane.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.840
Instead of having this new axis in the z direction, like you might expect, for a better

11:39.840 --> 11:44.840
analogy with how we'll visualize quaternions, we'll want to orient things so that the i

11:44.840 --> 11:50.880
and the j axes sit in the x and the y directions, with the real number line aligned along the

11:50.880 --> 11:53.600
z direction.

11:53.600 --> 11:58.600
So every point in 3D space is described as some real number plus some real number times

11:58.600 --> 12:01.800
i plus some real number times j.

12:01.800 --> 12:05.960
As it happens, it's not possible to define a notion of multiplication for a 3D number

12:05.960 --> 12:10.440
system like this that would satisfy the usual algebraic properties that make multiplication

12:10.440 --> 12:11.940
a useful construct.

12:11.940 --> 12:15.720
Perhaps I'll outline why this is the case in a follow-on video, but staying focused

12:15.720 --> 12:20.880
on our current goal, think about describing 3D rotations in this coordinate system to

12:20.880 --> 12:22.880
Felix the Flatlander.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.080
The unit sphere consists of all those numbers which are a distance one from zero at the

12:27.080 --> 12:35.320
origin, meaning the sum of the squares of their coordinates is one.

12:35.320 --> 12:40.400
We can't show all of 3D space to Felix, but what we can do is project this 2D surface

12:40.400 --> 12:46.200
to him and give him a feel for what reorientations of this sphere look like under that projection.

12:46.200 --> 12:50.880
Analogous to what we did before, stereographic projection will associate almost every point

12:50.880 --> 12:55.960
on the unit sphere with a unique point on the horizontal plane defined by the i and

12:55.960 --> 12:57.600
the j axes.

12:57.600 --> 13:02.160
For each point on the sphere, draw a line from negative one at the south pole through

13:02.160 --> 13:12.520
that point and see where it intersects the plane.

13:12.520 --> 13:16.240
So the point one at the north pole ends up at the center of the plane.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.560
All of the points of the northern hemisphere get mapped somewhere inside the unit circle

13:20.560 --> 13:26.120
of the i, j plane, and that unit circle, which passes through i, j, negative i, negative

13:26.120 --> 13:28.960
j, actually stays fixed in place.

13:28.960 --> 13:31.320
And that's an important point to make note of.

13:31.320 --> 13:35.240
Even though most points and lines and patches that Felix the Flatlander sees are going to

13:35.240 --> 13:39.960
be warped projections of the real sphere, this unit circle is the one thing that he

13:39.960 --> 13:47.560
has which is an honest part of our unit sphere, unaltered by projection.

13:47.560 --> 13:51.800
All of the points in the southern hemisphere get projected outside that unit circle, each

13:51.800 --> 13:56.480
getting farther and farther away as you approach negative one at the south pole.

13:56.480 --> 14:00.800
And again, negative one has no projection under this mapping, but what we say is that

14:00.800 --> 14:03.620
it ends up at some point at infinity.

14:03.620 --> 14:07.280
That point at infinity is something such that no matter which direction you walk on the

14:07.280 --> 14:11.600
plane, as you go infinitely far out, you'll be approaching that point.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.640
It's analogous to how if you walk any direction away from the north pole, you're approaching

14:15.640 --> 14:19.280
the south pole.

14:19.280 --> 14:23.000
Now let me just pull up a view of what Felix sees in two dimensions.

14:23.000 --> 14:28.200
As I rotate the sphere in various ways, the lines of latitude and longitude drawn on that

14:28.200 --> 14:33.160
sphere get projected into various circles and lines in Felix's space.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.960
And the way I've done things up here, the checkerboard pattern on the surface of the

14:35.960 --> 14:40.520
sphere is accurately reflected in the projected view that you see with Felix.

14:40.520 --> 14:45.600
And the pink dot represents where the point that started at the north pole ends up after

14:45.600 --> 14:48.120
the rotation.

14:48.120 --> 14:53.120
And that yellow circle represents where the equator ended up after the projection.

14:53.120 --> 14:56.800
The more you put yourself in Felix's shoes right now, the easier quaternions will be

14:56.800 --> 14:58.000
in a moment.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.720
And as with Linus, it helps to focus on a few key reference objects rather than trying

15:01.720 --> 15:03.720
to see the whole sphere.

15:03.720 --> 15:09.320
This circle, passing through one, i, negative one, and negative i, gets mapped onto a line

15:09.320 --> 15:12.640
which Felix sees as the horizontal axis.

15:12.640 --> 15:16.560
It's important to remind Felix that what he sees is not the same thing as the i-axis.

15:16.560 --> 15:21.040
Remember, we're only projecting the numbers that have a distance one from the origin.

15:21.040 --> 15:26.840
So most points on the actual i-axis, like zero and two i and three i, etc., are completely

15:26.840 --> 15:29.640
invisible to Felix.

15:29.640 --> 15:35.840
Similarly, the circle that passes through one, j, negative one, and negative j gets projected

15:35.840 --> 15:38.840
onto what he sees as a vertical line.

15:38.840 --> 15:43.840
And in general, any line that Felix sees comes from some circle on the sphere that

15:43.840 --> 15:45.920
passes through negative one.

15:45.920 --> 15:55.600
In some sense, a line is just a circle that passes through the pointed infinity.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.800
Now think about what Felix sees as we rotate the sphere.

15:58.800 --> 16:04.920
A 90-degree rotation about the j-axis brings one to i, i to negative one, negative one

16:04.920 --> 16:08.080
to negative i, and negative i to one.

16:08.080 --> 16:12.720
Also what Felix the Flatlander sees is an extension of the rotation that Linus the

16:12.720 --> 16:14.880
Linelander was seeing.

16:14.880 --> 16:20.240
Notice also that this action rotates the i, j unit circle to the position where the one

16:20.240 --> 16:22.480
j unit circle used to be.

16:22.480 --> 16:27.960
So what Felix sees is his yellow unit circle getting transformed into a vertical line while

16:27.960 --> 16:32.200
that red vertical line gets transformed into the unit circle.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.720
Of course, from our perspective, we know this is all just rigid motion.

16:35.720 --> 16:38.440
No actual stretching or morphing is taking place.

16:38.440 --> 16:41.680
All of that is just an artifact of the projection.

16:41.680 --> 16:48.600
Similarly, a rotation about the i-axis involves moving one to j, j to negative one, negative

16:48.600 --> 16:51.600
one to negative j, and negative j to one.

16:51.600 --> 16:57.640
This rotation turns the i, j unit circle into the one i unit circle, which to Felix looks

16:57.640 --> 17:09.480
like the unit circle getting transformed into a horizontal line.

17:09.480 --> 17:13.920
A rotation about the real axis is actually quite easy for Felix to understand, since

17:13.920 --> 17:17.880
the whole projection simply gets rotated about the origin, where the only points staying

17:17.880 --> 17:29.280
fixed in place are one at the origin and negative one off at infinity.

17:29.280 --> 17:33.640
In the same way that the complex numbers included the real numbers with a single extra quote

17:33.640 --> 17:39.200
unquote imaginary dimension represented by the unit i, and that the not actually a number

17:39.200 --> 17:45.240
system thing we had in three dimensions included a second imaginary direction, j, the quaternions

17:45.240 --> 17:49.920
include the real numbers together with three separate imaginary dimensions represented by

17:49.920 --> 17:52.720
the units i, j, and k.

17:52.720 --> 17:57.280
Each of these three imaginary dimensions is perpendicular to the real number line and

17:57.280 --> 18:01.920
they're all perpendicular to each other somehow.

18:01.920 --> 18:06.600
So in the same way that complex numbers are represented as a pair of real numbers, each

18:06.600 --> 18:12.200
quaternion can be written using four real numbers and it lives in four dimensional space.

18:12.200 --> 18:17.080
You often think of this as being broken up into a real or scalar part and then a 3D imaginary

18:17.080 --> 18:18.080
part.

18:18.080 --> 18:23.440
And Hamilton used a special word for quaternions that had no real part and just i, j, k components,

18:23.440 --> 18:29.000
a word which was previously somewhat foreign in the lingo of math and physics, vector.

18:29.000 --> 18:33.560
On the one hand, you could just define quaternion multiplication by giving the rules for how

18:33.560 --> 18:38.840
i, j, and k multiply together and saying that everything must distribute nicely.

18:38.840 --> 18:43.800
This is analogous to defining complex multiplication by saying that i times i is negative one and

18:43.800 --> 18:46.320
then distributing and simplifying products.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.960
And indeed, this is how you would tell a computer to perform quaternion multiplication and the

18:50.960 --> 18:55.920
relative compactness of this operation compared to say matrix multiplication is what's made

18:55.920 --> 18:59.400
quaternion so useful for graphics programming and many other things.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.440
There's also a rather elegant form of this multiplication rule written in terms of the

19:03.440 --> 19:08.200
dot product and the cross product and in some sense, quaternion multiplication subsumes

19:08.200 --> 19:12.640
both of these notions, at least as they appear in three dimensions.

19:12.640 --> 19:16.600
But just as a deeper understanding for complex multiplication comes from understanding its

19:16.600 --> 19:21.760
geometry that multiplying by a complex number involves a combination of scaling and rotating,

19:21.760 --> 19:26.180
you and I are here for the four-dimensional geometry of quaternion multiplication.

19:26.180 --> 19:30.560
And just as the magnitude of a complex number, its distance from zero, is the square root

19:30.560 --> 19:34.880
of the sum of the squares of its component, that same operation gives you the magnitude

19:34.880 --> 19:38.480
of a quaternion.

19:38.480 --> 19:45.640
And multiplying one quaternion, q1, by another, q2, has the effect of scaling q2 by the magnitude

19:45.640 --> 19:51.080
of q1 followed by a very special type of rotation in four dimensions.

19:51.080 --> 19:55.640
And those special 4D rotations, the heart of what we need to understand, correspond

19:55.640 --> 20:00.640
to the hypersphere of quaternions, a distance one from the origin, both in the sense that

20:00.640 --> 20:06.600
the quaternions whose multiplying action is a pure rotation live on that hypersphere,

20:06.600 --> 20:10.560
and in the sense that we can understand this weird 4D action just by following points on

20:10.560 --> 20:14.680
the hypersphere, rather than trying to look at all of the points in the inconceivable

20:14.680 --> 20:17.240
stretches of four-dimensional space.

20:17.240 --> 20:22.160
Analogous to what we did for Linus and Felix, we stereographically project this hypersphere

20:22.160 --> 20:27.680
into 3D space.

20:27.680 --> 20:32.280
This label in the upper right is going to show a given unit quaternion, and this little

20:32.280 --> 20:38.760
pink dot will show where that particular quaternion gets projected in our 3D space.

20:38.760 --> 20:42.640
Just as before, we're projecting from the number negative one, which sits on the real

20:42.640 --> 20:48.560
number line that is somehow perpendicular to all of our 3D space and beyond our perception.

20:48.560 --> 20:53.900
Just as before, the number one ends up projected straight into the center of our space.

20:53.900 --> 20:58.340
And in the same way that i and negative i were fixed in place for Linus, and that the

20:58.340 --> 21:04.820
i,j unit circle was fixed in place for Felix, we get a whole sphere passing through i,j

21:04.820 --> 21:09.940
and k on that unit hypersphere, which stays in place under the projection.

21:09.940 --> 21:15.260
So what we see as a unit sphere in our 3D space represents the only unaltered part of

21:15.260 --> 21:19.180
the hypersphere of quaternions getting projected down onto us.

21:19.180 --> 21:23.300
It's something analogous to the equator of a 3D sphere, and it represents all of the

21:23.300 --> 21:28.260
unit quaternions whose real part is zero, what Hamilton would have described as unit

21:28.260 --> 21:32.180
vectors.

21:32.180 --> 21:37.460
The unit quaternions with positive real parts, between zero and one, end up somewhere inside

21:37.460 --> 21:41.900
this unit sphere, closer to the number one in our 3D space, which should feel analogous

21:41.900 --> 21:47.540
to how the northern hemisphere got mapped inside the unit circle for Felix.

21:47.540 --> 21:51.460
On the other hand, all the unit quaternions with negative real part end up somewhere

21:51.460 --> 22:00.500
outside that unit sphere.

22:00.500 --> 22:04.140
The number negative one is sitting off at the pointed infinity, which you can easily

22:04.140 --> 22:07.060
find by walking in any direction.

22:07.060 --> 22:10.980
Keep in mind, even though we see the projection of some of these quaternions as being closer

22:10.980 --> 22:15.340
or farther from the origin of our 3D space, everything you're looking at represents a

22:15.340 --> 22:20.300
unit quaternion, so everything you're looking at really has the same magnitude, the same

22:20.300 --> 22:22.580
distance from the number zero.

22:22.580 --> 22:26.260
And that number zero itself is nowhere to be found in this picture.

22:26.260 --> 22:30.960
Like all other non-unit quaternions, it's invisible to us.

22:30.960 --> 22:34.780
In the same way that for Felix, the circle passing through one, i, negative one, and

22:34.780 --> 22:40.700
negative i got projected into a line through the origin.

22:40.700 --> 22:45.420
When we see this line through the origin passing through i and negative i, we should understand

22:45.420 --> 22:47.740
that it really represents a circle.

22:47.860 --> 22:52.820
Likewise, up on the hypersphere, invisible to us, there is a unit sphere passing through

22:52.820 --> 22:57.140
one, i, j, negative one, negative i, and negative j.

22:57.140 --> 23:01.940
And that whole sphere gets projected into the plane that we see passing through one,

23:01.940 --> 23:06.740
i, negative i, j, negative j, and negative one, off at infinity, what you and I might

23:06.740 --> 23:08.660
call the xy plane.

23:08.660 --> 23:13.900
In general, any plane that you see here really represents the projection of a sphere somewhere

23:13.900 --> 23:17.580
up on the hypersphere, which passes through the number negative one.

23:19.580 --> 23:24.300
Now the action of taking a unit quaternion and multiplying it by any other quaternion

23:24.300 --> 23:29.980
from the left can be thought of in terms of two separate 2D rotations happening perpendicular

23:29.980 --> 23:35.540
to and in sync with each other in a way that could only ever be possible in four dimensions.

23:35.540 --> 23:38.900
As a first example, let's look at multiplication by i.

23:38.900 --> 23:43.300
We already know what this does to the circle that passes through one and i, which we see

23:43.300 --> 23:46.060
as a line.

23:46.060 --> 23:53.420
One goes to i, i goes to negative one, off at infinity, negative one comes back around

23:53.420 --> 23:56.620
to negative i, and negative i goes to one.

23:56.620 --> 24:00.900
Remember, just like what line is saw, all of this is the stereographic projection of

24:00.900 --> 24:03.260
a 90 degree rotation.

24:03.260 --> 24:08.100
Now look at the circle passing through j and k, which is in a sense perpendicular to the

24:08.100 --> 24:10.460
circle passing through one and i.

24:10.460 --> 24:14.180
Now it might feel weird to talk about two circles being perpendicular to each other,

24:14.180 --> 24:17.340
especially when they have the same center, the same radius, and they don't touch each

24:17.340 --> 24:21.780
other at all, but nothing could be more natural in four dimensions.

24:21.780 --> 24:27.500
You can think of the action of i on this perpendicular circle as obeying a certain right hand rule.

24:27.500 --> 24:31.740
If you'll excuse the intrusion of my ghostly green screen hand into our otherwise pristine

24:31.740 --> 24:36.180
platonic mathematical stage, you let that thumb of your right hand point from the number

24:36.180 --> 24:39.500
one to i and you curl your fingers.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.780
The jk circle will rotate in the direction of that curl.

24:43.780 --> 24:44.780
How much?

24:44.780 --> 24:50.780
Well, by the same amount as the one i circle rotates, which is 90 degrees in this case.

24:50.780 --> 24:56.100
This is what I meant by two rotations perpendicular to and in sync with each other.

24:56.100 --> 25:08.100
So j goes to k, k goes to negative j, negative j goes to negative k, and negative k goes

25:08.100 --> 25:11.240
to j.

25:11.240 --> 25:15.620
This gives us a little table for what the number i does to the other quaternions.

25:15.620 --> 25:18.860
But I want this not to be something that you memorize, but something that you could close

25:18.860 --> 25:21.260
your eyes and you could really see.

25:21.260 --> 25:27.020
Computationally, if you know what a quaternion does to the numbers one, i, j, and k, you

25:27.020 --> 25:32.300
know what it does to any arbitrary quaternion, since multiplication distributes nicely.

25:32.300 --> 25:37.860
In the language of linear algebra, one, i, j, and k form a basis of our four-dimensional

25:37.860 --> 25:42.860
space, so knowing what our transformation does to them gives us the full information about

25:42.860 --> 25:45.060
what it does to all of space.

25:45.060 --> 25:49.500
Geometrically, a four-dimensional creature would be able to look at those two perpendicular

25:49.500 --> 25:54.900
rotations that I just described and understand that they lock you into one and only one rigid

25:54.900 --> 25:56.820
motion for the hypersphere.

25:56.820 --> 26:02.100
We might lack the intuitions of such a hypothetical creature, but we can maybe try to get close.

26:02.100 --> 26:07.380
Here's what the action of repeatedly multiplying by i looks like on our stereographic projection

26:07.380 --> 26:09.900
of the i, j, k sphere.

26:09.900 --> 26:14.100
It gets rotated into what we see as a plane, then gets rotated further back to where it

26:14.100 --> 26:19.340
used to be, though the orientation is all reversed now, then it gets rotated again into

26:19.340 --> 26:25.260
what we see as a plane, and after the fourth iteration it ends up right back where it started.

26:25.260 --> 26:29.540
As another example, think of a quaternion like q equals negative square root of two

26:29.540 --> 26:34.300
over two plus square root of two over two times i, which, if we pull up a picture of

26:34.300 --> 26:41.380
a complex plane, is a 135 degree rotation away from one in the direction of i.

26:41.380 --> 26:46.260
Under our projection, we see this along the line from one to i somewhere outside the unit

26:46.260 --> 26:47.340
sphere.

26:47.340 --> 26:51.740
If that sounds weird, just remember how Linus would have seen this same number.

26:51.740 --> 26:56.980
The action of multiplying this q by all other quaternions will look to us like dragging the

26:56.980 --> 27:02.900
point at one all the way to this projected version of q, while the jk circle gets rotated

27:02.900 --> 27:10.580
135 degrees, according to our right hand rule.

27:10.580 --> 27:13.780
Multiplication by any other quaternion is completely similar.

27:13.780 --> 27:17.920
For example, let's see what it looks like for j to act on other quaternions by multiplication

27:17.920 --> 27:19.420
from the left.

27:19.420 --> 27:24.700
The circle, through one and j, which we see projected as a line through the origin, gets

27:24.700 --> 27:28.180
rotated 90 degrees, dragging one up to j.

27:28.180 --> 27:38.540
So j times one is one, and j times j is negative one.

27:38.540 --> 27:44.420
The circle perpendicular to that one, passing through i and k, gets rotated 90 degrees,

27:44.420 --> 27:48.740
according to this right hand rule, where you point your thumb from one to j.

27:48.740 --> 28:02.180
So j times i is negative k, and j times k is i.

28:02.180 --> 28:06.900
In general, for any other unit quaternion you see somewhere in space, start by drawing

28:06.900 --> 28:12.060
the unit circle passing through one, q, and negative one, which we see in our projection

28:12.060 --> 28:14.420
as a line through the origin.

28:14.420 --> 28:18.980
Then draw the circle perpendicular to that one on what we see as the unit sphere.

28:18.980 --> 28:24.180
You rotate the first circle so that one ends up where q was, and rotate the perpendicular

28:24.180 --> 28:40.600
circle by the same amount according to the right hand rule.

28:40.600 --> 28:44.260
One thing worth noticing here is that order of multiplication matters.

28:44.260 --> 28:47.420
It's not, as mathematicians would say, commutative.

28:47.420 --> 28:52.580
For example, i times j is k, which you might think of in terms of i acting on the quaternion

28:52.580 --> 28:54.980
j, rotating it up to k.

28:54.980 --> 29:01.780
But if you think of j as acting on i, j times i, it rotates i to negative k.

29:01.780 --> 29:06.400
In fact, commutativity, this ability to swap the order of multiplication, is a way more

29:06.400 --> 29:09.260
special property than a lot of people realize.

29:09.260 --> 29:12.940
And most groups of actions on some space don't have it.

29:12.940 --> 29:16.900
Things like how in solving a Rubik's cube, order matters a lot.

29:16.900 --> 29:21.860
Or how rotating a cube about the z-axis and then about the x-axis gives a different final

29:21.860 --> 29:29.420
state from rotating it about the x-axis then about the z-axis.

29:29.420 --> 29:33.580
And last, as one final but rather important point, so far I've shown you how to think

29:33.580 --> 29:38.860
about quaternions as acting by left multiplication, where when you read an expression like i times

29:38.860 --> 29:44.020
j, you think of i as a kind of function morphing all of space, and j is just one of the points

29:44.020 --> 29:45.020
that it's acting on.

29:45.020 --> 29:50.380
But you can also think of them as a different sort of action, by multiplying from the right,

29:50.380 --> 29:53.780
where in this expression, j would be acting on i.

29:53.780 --> 29:57.060
In that case, the rule for multiplication is very similar.

29:57.060 --> 30:01.420
It's still the case that 1 goes to j and j goes to negative 1, etc.

30:01.420 --> 30:06.340
But instead of applying the right hand rule to the circle perpendicular to the 1j circle,

30:06.340 --> 30:08.180
you would use your left hand.

30:08.180 --> 30:12.820
So either way, i times j is equal to k, but you can either think about this with your

30:12.820 --> 30:18.980
right hand curling the number j to the number k, as your thumb points from 1 to i, or as

30:18.980 --> 30:25.460
your left hand curling i to k, as its thumb points from 1 to j.

30:25.460 --> 30:30.180
Understanding this left hand rule for multiplication from the other side will be extremely useful

30:30.180 --> 30:35.700
for understanding how unit quaternions describe rotation in three dimensions.

30:35.700 --> 30:40.700
And so far, it's probably not clear how exactly quaternions do describe 3D rotation.

30:40.700 --> 30:45.420
I mean, if you consider one of these actions on the unit sphere, passing through i, j, and

30:45.420 --> 30:49.980
k, it doesn't leave that sphere in place, it morphs it out of position, so the way that

30:49.980 --> 30:54.140
this works is slightly more complicated than a single quaternion product.

30:54.140 --> 30:57.940
It involves a process called conjugation, and I'll make a full follow on video all

30:57.940 --> 31:02.140
about it so that we have the time to go through some examples.

31:02.140 --> 31:05.820
In the meantime, for more information on the story of quaternions and their relation

31:05.820 --> 31:11.260
to orientation in 3D space, Quanta, a mathematical publication I'm sure a lot of you are familiar

31:11.260 --> 31:17.220
with, just put out a post in a kind of loose conjunction with this video, link in the description.

31:17.220 --> 31:21.220
If you enjoyed this, consider sharing it with some friends, and if you felt like the narrative

31:21.220 --> 31:26.020
structure here was actually helpful for understanding, maybe reassure those friends who would be

31:26.020 --> 31:30.620
turned off by a large time stamp that good math is actually worth the time.

31:30.620 --> 31:34.660
And many thanks to the patrons among you, I actually spent way longer than I care to

31:34.660 --> 31:39.140
admit on this project, so your patience and support is especially appreciated this time

31:39.140 --> 31:39.580
around.
