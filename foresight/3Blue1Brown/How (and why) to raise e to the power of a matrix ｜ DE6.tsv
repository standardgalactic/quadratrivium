0	3840	Let me pull out an old differential equations textbook that I learned from in college,
3840	9520	and let's turn to this funny little exercise in here that asks the reader to compute e to the power
9520	15600	at, where a, we're told, is going to be a matrix, and the insinuation seems to be that the results
15600	21120	will also be a matrix. It then offers several examples for what you might plug in for a.
22000	26560	Now, taking out a context, putting a matrix into an exponent like this probably seems like total
27440	31760	nonsense, but what it refers to is an extremely beautiful operation, and the reason it shows up
31760	36480	in this book is that it's useful. It's used to solve a very important class of differential
36480	41440	equations. In turn, given that the universe is often written in the language of differential
41440	46400	equations, you see this pop up in physics all the time too, especially in quantum mechanics,
46400	51120	where matrix exponents are littered throughout the place. They play a particularly prominent role.
51120	54720	This has a lot to do with Schrodinger's equation, which we'll touch on a bit later,
54720	59440	and it may also help in understanding your romantic relationships, but again, all in due time.
65520	69680	A big part of the reason I want to cover this topic is that there is an extremely nice way to
69680	74800	visualize what matrix exponents are actually doing using flow that not a lot of people seem to talk
74800	80240	about. But for the bulk of this chapter, let's start by laying out what exactly the operation is,
80240	83520	and see if we can get a feel for what kinds of problems it helps us to solve.
84240	88320	The first thing you should know is that this is not some bizarre way to multiply the constant
88320	94000	e by itself multiple times. You would be right to call that nonsense. The actual definition
94000	98320	is related to a certain infinite polynomial for describing real number powers of e,
98320	103200	what we call its Taylor series. For example, if I took the number two and plugged it into this
103200	109360	polynomial, then as you add more and more terms, each of which looks like some power of two divided
109360	121120	by some factorial. The sum approaches a number near 7.389, and this number is precisely e times e.
122000	127040	If you increment this input by one, then somewhat miraculously, no matter where you started from,
127040	131040	the effect on the output is always to multiply it by another factor of e.
132160	136080	For reasons that you're going to see in a bit, mathematicians became interested in plugging
136080	141040	all kinds of things into this polynomial, things like complex numbers, and for our purposes today,
141040	145680	matrices, even when those objects do not immediately make sense as exponents.
146480	151120	What some authors do is give this infinite polynomial the name exp when you plug in more
151120	156400	exotic inputs. It's a gentle nod to the connection that this has to exponential functions in the
156400	160240	case of real numbers, even though obviously these inputs don't make sense as exponents.
160800	166000	However, an equally common convention is to give a much less gentle nod to the connection and just
166080	170320	abbreviate the whole thing as e to the power of whatever object you're plugging in,
170320	174400	whether that's a complex number or a matrix, or all sorts of more exotic objects.
174960	180160	So while this equation is a theorem for real numbers, it's a definition for more exotic inputs.
180880	183840	Cynically, you could call this a blatant abuse of notation.
184560	188720	More charitably, you might view it as an example of the beautiful cycle between discovery and
188720	194080	invention in math. In either case, plugging in a matrix even to a polynomial might seem a little
194080	199440	strange, so let's be clear on what we mean here. The matrix has to have the same number of rows and
199440	205200	columns. That way, you can multiply it by itself according to the usual rules of matrix multiplication.
205200	210960	This is what we mean by squaring it. Similarly, if you were to take that result and then multiply
210960	215680	it by the original matrix again, this is what we mean by cubing the matrix.
217760	222320	If you carry on like this, you can take any whole number power of a matrix. It's perfectly
222320	227440	sensible. In this context, powers still mean exactly what you would expect, repeated multiplication.
234000	238240	Each term in this polynomial is scaled by one divided by some factorial,
238240	242240	and with matrices, all that means is that you multiply each component by that number.
243040	247360	Likewise, it always makes sense to add together two matrices. This is something that you again
247360	253280	do term by term. The astute among you might ask how sensible it is to take this out to infinity,
253280	257200	which would be a great question, one that I'm largely going to postpone the answer to,
257200	262720	but I can show you one pretty fun example here now. Take this 2 by 2 matrix that has negative
262720	268240	pi and pi sitting off its diagonal entries. Let's see what the sum gives. The first term
268240	272640	is the identity matrix. This is actually what we mean by definition when we raise a matrix to
272640	278720	the zeroth power. Then we add the matrix itself, which gives us the pi off the diagonal terms,
278720	283680	and then add half of the matrix squared. And continuing on, I'll have the computer keep
283680	288720	adding more and more terms, each of which requires taking one more matrix product to get the new power
288720	294480	and then adding it to a running tally. And as it keeps going, it seems to be approaching a stable
294480	300160	value, which is around negative one times the identity matrix. In this sense, we say the infinite
300160	305440	sum equals that negative identity. By the end of this video, my hope is that this particular
305440	310400	fact comes to make total sense to you. For any of you familiar with Euler's famous identity,
310400	315440	this is essentially the matrix version of that. It turns out that in general, no matter what
315440	321040	matrix you start with, as you add more and more terms, you eventually approach some stable value,
321040	323680	though sometimes it can take quite a while before you get there.
324160	332960	Just seeing the definition like this in isolation raises all kinds of questions. Most notably,
332960	337200	why would mathematicians and physicists be interested in torturing their poor matrices this
337200	342240	way? What problems are they trying to solve? And if you're anything like me, a new operation is
342240	347680	only satisfying when you have a clear view of what it's trying to do, some sense of how to predict
347680	352400	the output based on the input before you actually crunch the numbers. How on earth could you have
352400	357680	predicted that the matrix with pi off the diagonals results in a negative identity matrix like this?
358960	363120	Often in math, you should view the definition not as a starting point, but as a target.
363680	368240	Contrary to the structure of textbooks, mathematicians do not start by making definitions
368240	372800	and enlisting a lot of theorems and proving them and then showing some examples. The process of
372800	378080	discovering math typically goes the other way around. They start by chewing on specific problems
378080	382640	and then generalizing those problems, then coming up with constructs that might be helpful in those
382640	388080	general cases, and only then do you write down a new definition or extend an old one.
389200	392960	As to what sorts of specific examples might motivate matrix exponents,
392960	398640	two come to mind. One involving relationships and the other quantum mechanics. Let's start with
398640	407520	relationships. Suppose we have two lovers, let's call them Romeo and Juliet, and let's let X
407600	414320	represent Juliet's love for Romeo and Y represent his love for her, both of which are going to be
414320	419440	values that change with time. This is an example that we actually touched on in chapter one.
419440	424000	It's based on a Steven Strogett's article, but it's okay if you didn't see that. The way their
424000	429680	relationship works is that the rate at which Juliet's love for Romeo changes, the derivative of this
429680	436880	value, is equal to negative one times Romeo's love for her. So in other words, when Romeo is expressing
436880	443200	cool disinterest, that's when Juliet's feelings actually increase, whereas if he becomes too infatuated,
443200	449760	her interest will start to fade. Romeo, on the other hand, is the opposite. The rate of change of
449760	455840	his love is equal to the size of Juliet's love. So while Juliet is mad at him, his affections tend to
455840	463920	decrease. Whereas if she loves him, that's when his feelings grow. Of course, neither one of these
463920	469520	numbers is holding still. As Romeo's love increases in response to Juliet, her equation
469520	475920	continues to apply and drives her love down. Both of these equations always apply from each
475920	481120	infinitesimal point in time to the next, so every slight change to one value immediately
481120	486960	influences the rate of change of the other. This is a system of differential equations.
486960	492640	It's a puzzle where your challenge is to find explicit functions for X of t and Y of t that
492720	497920	make both of these expressions true. Now, as systems of differential equations go,
497920	503040	this one is on the simpler side. Enough so that many calculus students could probably just guess
503040	508160	at an answer. But keep in mind, it's not enough to find some pair of functions that makes this
508160	513680	true. If you want to actually predict where Romeo and Juliet end up after some starting point,
513680	518800	you have to make sure that your functions match the initial set of conditions at time t equals zero.
519600	524400	More to the point, our actual goal today is to systematically solve more general versions
524400	528880	of this equation without guessing and checking, and it's that question that leads us to matrix
528880	534400	exponents. Very often, when you have multiple changing values like this, it's helpful to
534400	539360	package them together as coordinates of a single point in a higher dimensional space. So for Romeo
539360	544240	and Juliet, think of their relationship as a point in a 2D space, the X-coordinate capturing
544240	554720	Juliet's feelings, and the Y-coordinate capturing Romeo's. Sometimes it's helpful to picture this
554720	559920	state as an arrow from the origin, other times just as a point. All that really matters is that it
559920	565840	encodes two numbers, and moving forward, we'll be writing that as a column vector. And of course,
565840	570800	this is all a function of time. You might picture the rate of change of this state,
570800	576080	the thing that packages together the derivative of X and the derivative of Y, as a kind of velocity
576080	581440	vector in this state space, something that tugs at our point in some direction and with some magnitude
581440	588800	that indicates how quickly it's changing. Remember, the rule here is that the rate of change of X
588800	595680	is negative Y, and the rate of change of Y is X. Set up as vectors like this, we could rewrite the
595680	601280	right-hand side of this equation as a product of this matrix with the original vector, X, Y.
601920	608960	The top row encodes Juliet's rule, and the bottom row encodes Romeo's rule. So what we have here
608960	614080	is a differential equation telling us that the rate of change of some vector is equal to a certain
614080	622400	matrix times itself. In a moment, we'll talk about how matrix exponentiation solves this kind of
622400	627440	equation. But before that, let me show you a simpler way that we can solve this particular system,
627440	632640	one that uses pure geometry, and it helps set the stage for visualizing matrix exponents a bit later.
634080	637280	This matrix from our system is a 90-degree rotation matrix.
638800	642480	For any of you rusty on how to think about matrices as transformations,
642480	647520	there's a video all about it on this channel, a series, really. The basic idea is that when
647520	654880	you multiply a matrix by the vector 1, 0, it pulls out the first column. And similarly,
654880	661280	if you multiply it by 0, 1, that pulls out the second column. What this means is that when you
661280	666960	look at a matrix, you can read its columns as telling you what it does to these two vectors,
666960	673120	known as the basis vectors. The way it acts on any other vector is a result of scaling and adding
673120	678640	these two basis results by that vector's coordinates. So looking back at the matrix
678640	683680	from our system, notice how from its columns, we can tell it takes the first basis vector to 0, 1,
683680	689040	and the second to negative 1, 0, hence why I'm calling it the 90-degree rotation matrix.
691040	696880	What it means for our equation is that it's saying wherever Romeo and Juliet are in this state space,
696880	701920	their rate of change has to look like a 90-degree rotation of this position vector.
702480	706640	The only way velocity can permanently be perpendicular to position like this
706640	711280	is when you rotate around the origin in circular motion, never growing or shrinking because the
711280	718880	rate of change has no component in the direction of the position. More specifically, since the
718880	725360	length of this velocity vector equals the length of the position vector, then for each unit of time,
725360	730640	the distance that this covers is equal to one radius's worth of arc length along that circle.
732240	737760	In other words, it rotates at one radian per unit time, so in particular, it would take
737760	744560	two pi units of time to make a full revolution. If you want to describe this kind of rotation
744560	749360	with a formula, we can use a more general rotation matrix, which looks like this.
750320	754400	Again, we can read it in terms of the columns. Notice how the first column tells us that it
754400	761360	takes that first basis vector to cosine of t, sine of t, and the second column tells us that
761360	766720	it takes the second basis vector to negative sine of t, cosine of t, both of which are consistent
766720	772560	with rotating by t radians. So, to solve the system, if you want to predict where Romeo and
772560	778800	Juliet end up after t units of time, you can multiply this matrix by their initial state.
780240	784400	The active viewers among you might also enjoy taking a moment to pause and confirm that the
784400	789440	explicit formula as you get out of this for x of t and y of t really do satisfy the system of
789440	799760	differential equations that we started with. The mathematician in you might wonder if it's
799760	804720	possible to solve not just this specific system, but equations like it for any other matrix,
804720	810080	no matter what its coefficients. To ask this question is to set yourself up to rediscover
810080	815440	matrix exponents. The main goal for today is for you to understand how this equation lets you
815440	820880	intuitively picture the operation which we write as e raised to a matrix, and on the flip side,
820880	825440	how being able to compute matrix exponents lets you explicitly solve this equation.
826320	831280	A much less whimsical example is Schrodinger's famous equation, which is the fundamental equation
831280	837040	describing how systems in quantum mechanics change over time. It looks pretty intimidating,
837040	840880	and I mean it's quantum mechanics, so of course it will, but it's actually not that different
840880	846240	from the Romeo-Juliet setup. This symbol here refers to a certain vector. It's a vector that
846240	850640	packages together all the information you might care about in a system, like the various particles,
850640	855600	positions, and momenta. It's analogous to our simpler 2D vector that encoded all the information
855600	861600	about Romeo and Juliet. The equation says that the rate at which this state vector changes looks
861600	866880	like a certain matrix times itself. There are a number of things that make Schrodinger's equation
866880	871360	notably more complicated, but in the back of your mind you might think of it as a target point that
871360	876560	you and I can build up to, with simpler examples, like Romeo and Juliet, offering more friendly
876560	882240	stepping stones along the way. Actually, the simplest example, which is tied to ordinary
882240	887680	real number powers of e, is the one-dimensional case. This is when you have a single changing value,
887680	893360	and its rate of change equals some constant times itself. So the bigger the value, the faster it grows.
894320	899280	Most people are more comfortable visualizing this with a graph, where the higher the value
899280	904240	of the graph, the steeper its slope, resulting in this ever-steepening upward curve. Just keep
904240	908000	in mind that when we get to higher dimensional variants, graphs are a lot less helpful.
909040	913200	This is a highly important equation in its own right. It's a very powerful concept when the
913200	918000	rate of change of a value is proportional to the value itself. This is the equation governing
918000	923120	things like compound interest, or the early stages of population growth, before the effects of
923120	929040	limited resources kick in, or the early stages of an epidemic, while most of the population is susceptible.
931760	937280	Calculus students all learn about how the derivative of e to the rt is r times itself.
938320	942880	In other words, this self-reinforcing growth phenomenon is the same thing as exponential
942880	950720	growth, and e to the rt solves this equation. Actually, a better way to think about it is that
950720	955200	there are many different solutions to this equation, one for each initial condition,
955200	960080	something like an initial investment size or an initial population, which we'll just call x0.
960800	965680	Notice, by the way, how the higher the value for x0, the higher the initial slope of the
965680	969760	resulting solution, which should make a complete sense given the equation.
971520	978080	The function e to the rt is just a solution when the initial condition is 1, but if you multiply
978080	982800	by any other initial condition, you get a new function which still satisfies this property,
982800	988560	it still has a derivative which is r times itself. But this time it starts at x0, since
988560	993680	e to the 0 is 1. This is worth highlighting before we generalize to more dimensions.
993680	997600	Do not think of the exponential part as being a solution in and of itself.
997600	1002320	Think of it as something that acts on an initial condition in order to give a solution.
1002800	1010320	You see, up in the two-dimensional case, when we have a changing vector whose
1010320	1016320	rate of change is constrained to be some matrix times itself, what the solution looks like is also
1016320	1021760	an exponential term acting on a given initial condition. But the exponential part in that case
1021760	1027440	will produce a matrix that changes with time, and the initial condition is a vector. In fact,
1027440	1031920	you should think of the definition of matrix exponentiation as being heavily motivated
1031920	1036960	by making sure that this fact is true. For example, if we look back at the system that
1036960	1043040	popped up with Romeo and Juliet, the claim now is that solutions look like e raised to this
1043040	1048720	0, negative 1, 1, 0 matrix, all times time, multiplied by some initial condition.
1049440	1053360	But we've already seen the solution in this case. We know it looks like a rotation matrix
1053360	1057840	times the initial condition. So let's take a moment to roll up our sleeves and compute the
1057840	1062240	exponential term using the definition that I mentioned at the start and see if it lines up.
1063120	1068320	Remember, writing e to the power of a matrix is a shorthand, a shorthand for plugging it in
1068320	1074320	to this long infinite polynomial, the Taylor series for e to the x. I know it might seem
1074320	1079360	pretty complicated to do this, but trust me, it's very satisfying how this particular one turns out.
1080080	1084240	If you actually sit down and you compute successive powers of this matrix,
1084240	1100160	what you'd notice is that they fall into a cycling pattern every four iterations.
1107440	1110800	This should make sense given that we know it's a 90 degree rotation matrix.
1111360	1116800	So when you add together all infinitely many matrices, term by term, each term in the result
1116800	1121920	looks like a polynomial in t with some nice cycling pattern in its coefficients,
1121920	1124320	all of them scaled by the relevant factorial term.
1125600	1129920	Those of you who are savvy with Taylor series might be able to recognize that each one of
1129920	1135280	these components is the Taylor series for either sine or cosine, though in that top right corner's
1135280	1141920	case it's actually negative sine. So what we get from the computation is exactly the rotation
1141920	1151440	matrix we had from before. To me, this is extremely beautiful. We have two completely different ways
1151440	1156240	of reasoning about the same system and they give us the same answer. I mean, it's reassuring that
1156240	1160480	they do, but it is wild just how different the mode of thought is when you're chugging through
1160480	1165200	this polynomial versus when you're geometrically reasoning about what a velocity perpendicular
1165200	1170560	to a position must imply. Hopefully, the fact that these line up inspires a little confidence
1170560	1175920	in the claim that matrix exponents really do solve systems like this. This explains the
1175920	1180240	computation we saw at the start, by the way, with the matrix that had negative pi and pi
1180240	1185280	off the diagonals, producing the negative identity. This expression is exponentiating
1185280	1191120	a 90 degree rotation matrix times pi, which is another way to describe what the Romeo-Juliet
1191120	1197520	setup does after pi units of time. As we now know, that has the effect of rotating everything 180
1197520	1203920	degrees in this state space, which is the same as multiplying by negative one. Also, for any of you
1203920	1208560	familiar with imaginary number exponents, this particular example is probably ringing a ton of
1208560	1214400	bells. It is 100% analogous. In fact, we could have framed the entire example where Romeo and
1214400	1219120	Juliet's feelings were packaged into a complex number, and the rate of change of that complex
1219120	1224560	number would have been i times itself, since multiplication by i also acts like a 90 degree
1224560	1230160	rotation. The same exact line of reasoning, both analytic and geometric, would have led to this
1230160	1236240	whole idea that e to the power i t describes rotation. These are actually two of many different
1236240	1240560	examples throughout math and physics, when you find yourself exponentiating some object which
1240560	1246640	acts as a 90 degree rotation times time. It shows up with quaternions or many of the matrices that
1246640	1251840	pop up in quantum mechanics. In all of these cases, we have this really neat general idea
1251840	1256880	that if you take some operation that rotates 90 degrees in some plane, often it's a plane in
1256880	1262320	some high-dimensional space that we can't visualize, then what we get by exponentiating that operation
1262320	1267040	times time is something that generates all other rotations in that same plane.
1269360	1273600	One of the more complicated variations on this same theme is Schrodinger's equation.
1273600	1278640	It's not just that this has the derivative of a state equal some matrix times that state form.
1279280	1285040	The nature of the relevant matrix here is such that the equation also describes a kind of rotation,
1285040	1289200	though in many applications of Schrodinger's equation it'll be a rotation in a kind of function
1289200	1294080	space. It's a little more involved though because typically there's a combination of many different
1294080	1298880	rotations. It takes time to really dig into this equation, and I would love to do that in a later
1298880	1305200	chapter, but right now I cannot help but at least allude to the fact that this imaginary unit i that
1305200	1310640	sits so impishly in such a fundamental equation for all of the universe is playing basically the same
1310640	1316320	role as the matrix from our Romeo and Juliet example. What this i communicates is that the
1316320	1322880	rate of change of a certain state is, in a sense, perpendicular to that state, and hence that the
1322880	1326560	way things have to evolve over time will involve a kind of oscillation.
1330960	1336240	But matrix exponentiation can do so much more than just rotation. You can always visualize
1336240	1341840	these sorts of differential equations using a vector field. The idea is that this equation
1341840	1347040	tells us the velocity of a state is entirely determined by its position, so what we do is go
1347040	1351920	to every point in the space and draw a little vector indicating what the velocity of a state
1351920	1357840	must be if it passes through that point. For our type of equation, this means that we go to each
1357840	1376480	point v in space and we attach the vector m times v. To intuitively understand how any given initial
1376480	1381840	condition will evolve, you let it flow along this field with a velocity always matching whatever
1381840	1387600	vector it's sitting on at any given point in time. So if the claim is that solutions to this
1387600	1393680	equation look like e to the mt times some initial condition, it means you can visualize what the
1393680	1399920	matrix e to the mt does by letting every possible initial condition flow along this field for t
1399920	1410000	units of time. The transition from start to finish is described by whatever matrix pops out from
1410000	1416480	the computation for e to the mt. In our main example with the 90-degree rotation matrix,
1416480	1422240	the vector field looks like this, and as we saw, e to the mt describes rotation in that case,
1422240	1428640	which lines up with flow along this field. As another example, the more Shakespearean Romeo
1428640	1432800	and Juliet might have equations that look a little more like this, where Juliet's rule
1432800	1437520	is symmetric with Romeo's, and both of them are inclined to get carried away in response to one
1437520	1442560	another's feelings. Again, the way the vector field you're looking at has been defined is to go
1442560	1448960	to each point v in space and attach the vector m times v. This is the pictorial way of saying that
1448960	1456080	the rate of change of a state must always equal m times itself. But for this example, flow along
1456080	1461200	the field looks a lot different from how it did before. If Romeo and Juliet start off anywhere
1461200	1465680	in this upper right half of the plane, their feelings will feed off of each other and they
1465680	1473680	both tend towards infinity. If they're in the other half of the plane, well, let's just say
1473680	1478880	that they stay more true to their Capulet and Montague family traditions. So even before you
1478880	1483760	try calculating the exponential of this particular matrix, you can already have an intuitive sense
1483760	1488960	for what the answer should look like. The resulting matrix should describe the transition from time
1488960	1494560	zero to time t, which, if you look at the field, seems to indicate that it will squish along one
1494560	1501520	diagonal while stretching along another, getting more extreme as t gets larger. Of course, all of
1501520	1506640	this is presuming that e to the mt times an initial condition actually solves these systems.
1507360	1511040	This is one of those facts that's easiest to believe when you just work it out yourself.
1512320	1517920	But I'll run through a quick rough sketch. Write out the full polynomial that defines
1517920	1522080	e to the mt and multiply by some initial condition vector on the right.
1525520	1531920	And then take the derivative of this with respect to t. Because the matrix m is a constant,
1531920	1534640	this just means applying the power rule to each one of the terms.
1543520	1547040	And that power rule really nicely cancels out with the factorial terms.
1547280	1558080	So what we're left with is an expression that looks almost identical to what we had before,
1558080	1562880	except that each term has an extra m hanging onto it. But this can be factored out to the left.
1563600	1569840	So the derivative of the expression is m times the original expression, and hence it solves the
1569840	1575360	equation. This actually sweeps under the rug some details required for rigor, mostly centered
1575360	1579760	around the question of whether or not this thing actually converges, but it does give the main idea.
1580880	1585120	In the next chapter I would like to talk more about the properties that this operation has,
1585120	1590080	most notably its relationship with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, which leads us to more concrete
1590080	1594720	ways of thinking about how you actually carry out this computation, which otherwise seems insane.
1595920	1600160	Also, time permitting, it might be fun to talk about what it means to raise e to the power of
1600160	1602160	the derivative operator.
