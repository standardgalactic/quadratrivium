0	14200	So all this framing material has been sitting here for three or four days because we had
14200	17600	already ordered all that material when we ordered our floor trusses originally and had
17600	23240	everything scheduled and when we figured out last week the issue with our floor truss
23240	27160	design it pushed our trusses out about a week.
27160	31760	So that's the reason all that other material got here early so we didn't want to have to
31760	34920	reschedule it, lose our delivery spot, all that good stuff so we just went ahead and
34920	38960	took it and trusses are here today.
38960	47280	Today is August 30th so it is hopefully going to start moving pretty quick here.
47280	58440	As we were waiting on our floor trusses today we decided to be productive and down we've
58440	62040	moved our burning operation further down the hill.
62040	69400	As you can see we're burning, getting the last little bit cleaned up down there.
69400	77160	This area down in here is actually where potentially we have zoning approval for a 40x60 shop
77160	88040	down there but we're going to continue the driveway on down all the way down and we're
88040	93080	going to make about a 40x40 parking area down there right now and then we've got the little
93080	95640	outbuilding down there that we built.
95640	103040	We built that a couple years ago and we just moved it over here from our house now so that's
103040	109400	going to be where we park trailers, dump trailers, campers, equipment trailers, park the track
109400	116440	hoe, get everything out of the way, kind of off where you're not looking at it all the
116440	117440	time.
117440	124440	We'll see, show you guys how these trusses get unloaded here.
147440	154440	We'll see you guys next time.
177440	188440	There it is.
207440	214440	We'll see you guys next time.
237440	244440	We'll see you guys next time.
267440	294040	So we got most of the roof trusses set last night, as you can see some of the LVLs in.
294040	299800	We did have an issue right here with our trusses.
299800	309080	They're the correct length here but the issue is this block out is for an 8 inch block which
309080	315640	is fine over here where we have the brick ledger but this wall is where our garage, upstairs
315640	319040	garage joins our basement.
319040	328360	So we've talked to our truss designers and this portion of the floor truss is not structural.
328360	332880	Really it's just a nailer to hang your drywall on.
332880	337320	So what we're allowed to do is we're just going to cut it here, we're going to cut it
337320	344600	here and that thing will sit right down in there and we will be good to go and be able
344600	352960	to finish getting the floor trusses on and probably get the subfloor on today so things
352960	373160	are moving along.
373160	386600	So there's our revision to our floor truss.
386600	407960	We cut out that notch so now it will sit down in the wall here.
407960	421080	It's like a glove.
421080	424560	Set the floor trusses yesterday and this morning, had to finish setting the floor trusses this
424560	432120	morning and almost have all the subfloor down today so by dark they'll have all the subfloor
432120	437760	down and be ready to start putting walls up tomorrow.
437760	446000	Today is August 31st, so tomorrow is the first day of September, Hadley, do you know that?
446000	455200	First day of September tomorrow, say bye bye, say see you later, later Gators.
