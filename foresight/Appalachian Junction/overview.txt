Checking Appalachian Junction/Ep 26 Installing floor trusses and subfloor!.txt
 The speaker is providing an update on a construction project where they encountered an issue with their floor truss design, which resulted in a one-week delay. To avoid rescheduling and losing their delivery spot for other materials, they took delivery of the trusses as soon as they arrived. The project is now back on track, and progress is being made despite the initial setback.

On August 30th, while waiting for the floor trusses to arrive, the team decided to use the time productively by moving their burning operation to a new location further down the hill. This area has potential for a 40x60 shop, which they plan to build after continuing the driveway and creating a 40x40 parking area. An existing outbuilding has been moved to this new site where it will serve as storage for trailers, dump trailers, campers, equipment trailers, and the trackhoe.

The floor trusses were mostly set in place the previous night, with some adjustments necessary due to an issue with a blockout that was intended for an 8-inch block but needed to fit against a different wall type. The truss designers resolved this by designing a notch for the truss to fit into the wall, ensuring that it would function as a nailer for drywall without being structurally essential.

As of August 31st, the subfloor was nearly completed, and the team expected to have it finished by the end of the day. With the successful resolution of the truss issue, they are on track to start erecting walls the following day, which is the first day of September. The speaker jokingly references the University of Florida's sports mascot, the Gators, with a playful "say bye bye, say see you later, later Gators," as they anticipate further progress on the project.
