00:00.000 --> 00:14.200
So all this framing material has been sitting here for three or four days because we had

00:14.200 --> 00:17.600
already ordered all that material when we ordered our floor trusses originally and had

00:17.600 --> 00:23.240
everything scheduled and when we figured out last week the issue with our floor truss

00:23.240 --> 00:27.160
design it pushed our trusses out about a week.

00:27.160 --> 00:31.760
So that's the reason all that other material got here early so we didn't want to have to

00:31.760 --> 00:34.920
reschedule it, lose our delivery spot, all that good stuff so we just went ahead and

00:34.920 --> 00:38.960
took it and trusses are here today.

00:38.960 --> 00:47.280
Today is August 30th so it is hopefully going to start moving pretty quick here.

00:47.280 --> 00:58.440
As we were waiting on our floor trusses today we decided to be productive and down we've

00:58.440 --> 01:02.040
moved our burning operation further down the hill.

01:02.040 --> 01:09.400
As you can see we're burning, getting the last little bit cleaned up down there.

01:09.400 --> 01:17.160
This area down in here is actually where potentially we have zoning approval for a 40x60 shop

01:17.160 --> 01:28.040
down there but we're going to continue the driveway on down all the way down and we're

01:28.040 --> 01:33.080
going to make about a 40x40 parking area down there right now and then we've got the little

01:33.080 --> 01:35.640
outbuilding down there that we built.

01:35.640 --> 01:43.040
We built that a couple years ago and we just moved it over here from our house now so that's

01:43.040 --> 01:49.400
going to be where we park trailers, dump trailers, campers, equipment trailers, park the track

01:49.400 --> 01:56.440
hoe, get everything out of the way, kind of off where you're not looking at it all the

01:56.440 --> 01:57.440
time.

01:57.440 --> 02:04.440
We'll see, show you guys how these trusses get unloaded here.

02:27.440 --> 02:34.440
We'll see you guys next time.

02:57.440 --> 03:08.440
There it is.

03:27.440 --> 03:34.440
We'll see you guys next time.

03:57.440 --> 04:04.440
We'll see you guys next time.

04:27.440 --> 04:54.040
So we got most of the roof trusses set last night, as you can see some of the LVLs in.

04:54.040 --> 04:59.800
We did have an issue right here with our trusses.

04:59.800 --> 05:09.080
They're the correct length here but the issue is this block out is for an 8 inch block which

05:09.080 --> 05:15.640
is fine over here where we have the brick ledger but this wall is where our garage, upstairs

05:15.640 --> 05:19.040
garage joins our basement.

05:19.040 --> 05:28.360
So we've talked to our truss designers and this portion of the floor truss is not structural.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.880
Really it's just a nailer to hang your drywall on.

05:32.880 --> 05:37.320
So what we're allowed to do is we're just going to cut it here, we're going to cut it

05:37.320 --> 05:44.600
here and that thing will sit right down in there and we will be good to go and be able

05:44.600 --> 05:52.960
to finish getting the floor trusses on and probably get the subfloor on today so things

05:52.960 --> 06:13.160
are moving along.

06:13.160 --> 06:26.600
So there's our revision to our floor truss.

06:26.600 --> 06:47.960
We cut out that notch so now it will sit down in the wall here.

06:47.960 --> 07:01.080
It's like a glove.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.560
Set the floor trusses yesterday and this morning, had to finish setting the floor trusses this

07:04.560 --> 07:12.120
morning and almost have all the subfloor down today so by dark they'll have all the subfloor

07:12.120 --> 07:17.760
down and be ready to start putting walls up tomorrow.

07:17.760 --> 07:26.000
Today is August 31st, so tomorrow is the first day of September, Hadley, do you know that?

07:26.000 --> 07:35.200
First day of September tomorrow, say bye bye, say see you later, later Gators.
