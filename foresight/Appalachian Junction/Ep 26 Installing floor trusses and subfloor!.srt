1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,200
So all this framing material has been sitting here for three or four days because we had

2
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,600
already ordered all that material when we ordered our floor trusses originally and had

3
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,240
everything scheduled and when we figured out last week the issue with our floor truss

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,160
design it pushed our trusses out about a week.

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,760
So that's the reason all that other material got here early so we didn't want to have to

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,920
reschedule it, lose our delivery spot, all that good stuff so we just went ahead and

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,960
took it and trusses are here today.

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:47,280
Today is August 30th so it is hopefully going to start moving pretty quick here.

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:58,440
As we were waiting on our floor trusses today we decided to be productive and down we've

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,040
moved our burning operation further down the hill.

11
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:09,400
As you can see we're burning, getting the last little bit cleaned up down there.

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,160
This area down in here is actually where potentially we have zoning approval for a 40x60 shop

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:28,040
down there but we're going to continue the driveway on down all the way down and we're

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,080
going to make about a 40x40 parking area down there right now and then we've got the little

15
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,640
outbuilding down there that we built.

16
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,040
We built that a couple years ago and we just moved it over here from our house now so that's

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,400
going to be where we park trailers, dump trailers, campers, equipment trailers, park the track

18
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,440
hoe, get everything out of the way, kind of off where you're not looking at it all the

19
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,440
time.

20
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:04,440
We'll see, show you guys how these trusses get unloaded here.

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,440
We'll see you guys next time.

22
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:08,440
There it is.

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,440
We'll see you guys next time.

24
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,440
We'll see you guys next time.

25
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:54,040
So we got most of the roof trusses set last night, as you can see some of the LVLs in.

26
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:59,800
We did have an issue right here with our trusses.

27
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:09,080
They're the correct length here but the issue is this block out is for an 8 inch block which

28
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,640
is fine over here where we have the brick ledger but this wall is where our garage, upstairs

29
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,040
garage joins our basement.

30
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:28,360
So we've talked to our truss designers and this portion of the floor truss is not structural.

31
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,880
Really it's just a nailer to hang your drywall on.

32
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,320
So what we're allowed to do is we're just going to cut it here, we're going to cut it

33
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:44,600
here and that thing will sit right down in there and we will be good to go and be able

34
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:52,960
to finish getting the floor trusses on and probably get the subfloor on today so things

35
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:13,160
are moving along.

36
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:26,600
So there's our revision to our floor truss.

37
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:47,960
We cut out that notch so now it will sit down in the wall here.

38
00:06:47,960 --> 00:07:01,080
It's like a glove.

39
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,560
Set the floor trusses yesterday and this morning, had to finish setting the floor trusses this

40
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,120
morning and almost have all the subfloor down today so by dark they'll have all the subfloor

41
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,760
down and be ready to start putting walls up tomorrow.

42
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:26,000
Today is August 31st, so tomorrow is the first day of September, Hadley, do you know that?

43
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:35,200
First day of September tomorrow, say bye bye, say see you later, later Gators.
