Checking MITCBMM/Introduction to transformer architecture and discussion.txt
1. **Machine Learning Architecture and Data Efficiency**: The discussion touched upon the importance of understanding the principles behind machine learning architectures, especially given the diversity of data and models (heterogeneity and architecture) in current AI systems. While some believe larger models will solve everything, it's crucial to recognize that this might not be the case and that hitting a wall could reveal what's truly correct or incorrect.

2. **Data Efficiency with Multimodal Data**: There was a conversation about whether learning becomes more efficient with multimodal data (combining visual information, text, etc.) versus single-modal datasets. The consensus seemed to be that language provides more rich and dense information per word compared to pixels per image, which has been demonstrated by the success of language-vision models like CLIP.

3. **Training Efficiency with Language**: It was noted that training diffusion models with text conditioning is significantly more efficient than training them unconditionally. This is because the text provides additional leverage and context, reducing costs from hundreds of thousands to potentially tens of millions of dollars for training large models.

4. **Supervision in Machine Learning**: The issue of supervision was raised, questioning if it's only about the economic cost of data acquisition or if there are other factors at play. It was suggested that the definition of supervised versus unsupervised tasks is not always clear and might be influenced by the costs involved.

5. **Neuroscience vs. Machine Learning**: There's a divergence in understanding between machine learning practitioners and neuroscientists regarding what constitutes supervision, with the economic cost being a less nuanced factor in neuroscience compared to machine learning.

6. **Next Steps**: The discussion concluded that more time is needed to delve deeper into these topics, and it was suggested that the conversation could continue in a few weeks, allowing for further exploration and possibly addressing more specific questions that emerged during the chat.
