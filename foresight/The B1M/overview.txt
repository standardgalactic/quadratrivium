 The Monaco Grand Prix is one of the most iconic and challenging events on the Formula One calendar, taking place on a street circuit in the principality of Monaco, which is smaller than New York's Central Park. Despite its small size, Monaco hosts over 200,000 spectators during the race weekend, growing its population by more than 500%. The event requires extensive preparation and logistics, including resurfacing about a third of the circuit, which is done at night to minimize disruption.

Approximately six weeks before the Grand Prix, temporary facilities such as grandstands, pit garages, barriers, and footbridges are constructed using prefabricated modules. These structures are assembled by a team of highly skilled engineers and require around 14 days to complete. The pit complex, while temporary, is as advanced as those at permanent tracks.

The circuit's official capacity is 37,000, but due to Monaco's unique layout, many more spectators can watch the race from various vantage points, including along the waterfront and from boats, hotels, and terraces. For safety, over 20,000 square metres of safety mesh and more than 21 km of safety railing are installed.

During the event, access to the circuit is unrestricted except between 5:30 am and 7:30 pm on race days. Monaco's Grand Prix is a significant logistical feat, with over 20,000 spectators attending on the final day, and it has managed to maintain its prestigious status despite competition from emerging markets for a place on the F1 calendar. The event's success is a testament to the dedication of the construction teams and engineers who transform this small nation into a world-class racing venue each year.
