Checking Formscapes/Consciousness, Being and Animacy; Whitehead, Bergson and the Bifurcation of Nature.txt
1. The video discusses the concept of reality as an organismic process, where everything from atoms to biological organisms is seen as a self-organizing, self-creative electromagnetic system. This perspective is influenced by the philosophy of Alfred North Whitehead, who viewed nature as fundamentally organic and experiential.

2. Whitehead's philosophy posits that there is no introversible gulf between human existence and the broader world; we are part of the ongoing creative advance of the cosmos. This view aligns with Francisco Varela's concept of autopoiesis, which refers to systems that self-reproduce their organization, maintaining their boundary and thus their identity.

3. The video touches on quantum electrodynamics (QED) as an example of where science is moving towards a more organismic understanding of reality. QED shows that particles like electrons have properties that are not fixed but behave in ways that suggest they are influenced by the act of observation, which aligns with an organic and experiential view of the world.

4. Whitehead's philosophy challenges the mechanistic view of the universe, where events are determined purely by causal chains. Instead, he suggests that nature is characterized by creativity and novelty, with biological organisms being a branch of a larger tree of life that includes atoms, stars, planetary systems, and galaxies.

5. The video recommends exploring further through videos on Rupert Sheldrake's morphic resonance and Michael Levin's research on bioelectricity to understand these ideas in more depth. It also suggests looking into the Electric Universe model of cosmology as an alternative to the current mechanistic models, particularly given new data from the James Webb Space Telescope that may challenge existing theories.

6. The video concludes by emphasizing that within an organismic paradigm, consciousness is not something that emerges from inanimate matter but is inherent in the fundamental processes of the world. Consequently, a scientific understanding of consciousness can be found not only in specialized disciplines but across all fields of science, as they study the very nature of experience and existence.

In summary, the video advocates for a paradigm shift from a mechanistic to an organismic view of the universe, where consciousness is a fundamental aspect of reality, and suggests that this perspective may offer new insights into scientific understanding, including the nature of consciousness itself.
