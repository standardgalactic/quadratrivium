30000	49540	Hi guys, so this video is part 2 of my previous video, so if you haven't seen that already
49540	54440	then you should consider checking that video out either before or after watching this one,
54440	58560	as it contains a great deal of context which you will probably find very illuminating.

68600	76840	Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.
76840	82640	What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.
82760	85760	Alpha North Whitehead
85760	90760	Previously I described the ways in which Descartes' philosophy resulted in what we
90760	99480	could call a bifurcation of nature, which separated the world into two distinct metaphysical realms,
99480	103320	that of mind and that of matter.
103320	108760	But it was another philosopher who would see most clearly the problems which were developing
108760	115880	from this modernist post-Cartesian paradigm and who would codify many of the conceptual
115880	121080	elements which would come to characterize modern thought for centuries to come.
121080	124520	That philosopher was Immanuel Kant.
124520	129960	Through David Hume, Kant would come to see the true extent of the implications wrought
129960	134080	by Descartes' systematic skepticism.
134080	140320	If we cannot be certain that our experiences of the world actually coincide with a world
140320	148280	beyond our perceptions, then how can we justify any of our empirical claims about the world
148280	149720	at all?
149720	157480	How do we know that any of our scientific claims actually have any objective validity?
157480	163920	Consolidates such knowledge about the world would require more than empirical observation.
163920	171440	We can observe that the sun has risen every day up until now, but we cannot simply observe
171440	175400	a law which demands such regularity.
175400	181880	We must infer such laws, and thus empirical observation alone is not enough to actually
181880	185560	ground scientific knowledge.
185560	191640	Nor can we say that the constancy of the sun's behavior is dictated by logic, as Kant understood
191680	198320	logical truths, to apply only to relations of ideas rather than facts about the natural
198320	200280	world.
200280	204520	Kant's solution was to make a distinction, much like Descartes' distinction between
204520	210760	mind and matter, between what he termed phenomena and numina.
210760	215400	For Kant, the world of phenomena was the world of experience.
215400	222480	The phenomenal world is the world as we experience it, the world as it is conditioned by our
222480	226480	faculties of perception and understanding.
226480	232880	Kant saw that the human psyche itself played a crucial role in synthesizing our sense perceptions
232880	237440	together into intelligible experiences.
237440	242400	Much like the way that the Copernican Revolution came to place the sun at the center of the
242400	248720	solar system, the Kantian Revolution placed the human psyche at the center of the world
248720	252000	which we actually experience.
252000	261000	According to Kant, we did not experience the world in itself, but rather experienced phenomena,
261000	266200	experiences of the world which were necessarily conditioned by the functioning of the human
266200	269080	mind in consistent ways.
269080	274840	By understanding the way that the human mind conditioned our experiences, Kant could in
274840	283600	a sense reclaim objectivity and thereby re-ground science in the wake of Cartesian and Humean
283600	286440	radical skepticism.
286440	293680	Hume had argued that we never actually experienced causation or time, and thus argued that we
293680	300000	inferred those aspects of reality in an irrational way.
300000	306840	Kant instead argued that space, time, and causality were all among a variety of categories
306840	313800	which the human mind necessarily used to condition our experiences of the world.
313800	321960	Space, time, and causation argued Kant were not necessarily aspects of the world in itself,
321960	328240	but were, at the very least, necessary aspects of the way that the human mind structures
328240	331520	our experiences of reality.
331520	338240	Those aspects were therefore necessary aspects of the phenomenal world, the world which we
338240	344360	experience, but not necessarily the world in itself.
344360	347680	But then what about the world as it actually is?
347680	354320	What about this presupposed ding on seek or thing in itself which Kant supposed to
354320	361640	lie somewhere behind or beneath the phenomenal world of experiences?
361640	367000	Within this Kantian understanding of reality, we never actually encounter the world as it
367000	370800	is in itself, but only phenomena.
370800	377280	The world itself is something which would thus seem to be forever beyond our reach.
377280	384720	We cannot go around our experiences to check if our experiences of the world actually correspond
384720	388280	to how the world actually is.
388280	394520	Although Kant believed that he had rescued science from radical skepticism, there remains
394520	401120	a looming epistemological nihilism behind Kant's ideas.
401120	405080	What if there is no world in itself?
405080	409840	If we, by definition, cannot encounter such a world?
409840	416880	Then what reason do we really have to believe that there is such a thing in itself at all?
416880	419680	Now of course this all might seem rather pedantic.
419680	426880	It seems rather obvious that there is indeed a world beyond our experiences of the world.
426880	433440	The world remains even after we look away and return our gaze to it.
433440	439840	Great walls stop foreheads regardless as to how our consciousness construes them.
439840	446240	But what we are seeing here in this problem is yet another unfolding of the deeply rooted
446240	451200	incoherence of the Cartesian worldview.
451200	457600	Constant demarcation of phenomena and numina is a kind of reformulation of the Cartesian
457600	461360	split between mind and matter.
461360	468720	Another split which would seem to create an infinitely vast and unbridgeable gulf between
468720	473360	our consciousness and the world which we inhabit.
473360	479760	Kant had no choice but to resign himself to a kind of epistemological quietism with regards
479760	482200	to the world beyond our senses.
482200	489320	He deeply held that there must be an actual world which exists independently of our experiences.
489400	494920	She saw no way to actually say anything about that world.
494920	501960	The world would have to remain forever beyond our grasp, an impenetrable mystery which would
501960	506560	always lie beyond the confines of our minds.
506560	512320	The paradigm of modern science presupposes that what lies beyond our consciousness is
512320	519200	something we call matter, which is supposed to be entirely objective in character, that
519200	522960	which exists independently of our senses.
522960	529680	Yet Kant had shown us that we can never actually encounter matter at all, but rather only our
529680	537120	experiences of an unknowable something which we can only presume to exist beyond our own
537120	539280	minds.
539280	544120	Following Kant, many philosophers would come to reject or reformulate Kant's distinction
544120	551200	between phenomena and numina in such a way that this intractable gulf could be mended.
551200	557160	One of those philosophers was Henri Bergson, initially educated as a mathematician and
557160	561960	later developing an acute interest in the French spiritualism movement, which would
561960	564960	also give us figures such as Jean Gebseur.
564960	571400	Henri Bergson rejected outright the Cartesian conception of mind as a kind of screen, which
571400	578880	separated us intractably from a world which was believed to be entirely devoid of consciousness.
578880	585520	In aiming for the heart of this issue, Bergson asks us in his monumental work, Matter and
585520	593400	Memory, to think about what matter must actually be given the way in which we actually experience
593480	595880	the world around us.
595880	599600	We begin with our experiences of the world.
599600	604400	We can then divert our attention from the world temporarily and return to see that the
604400	607760	objects of the world yet remain.
607760	612960	We thus rightly conclude that the world is not merely a projection of our minds, there
612960	619760	is something out there as it were, which is provided to our consciousness.
619760	624880	So what exactly is it that is provided by the world?
624880	628600	The answer is, of course, experiences.
628600	635200	There is never anything extra which we encounter by definition, and thus Bergson concludes
635200	643600	that matter, that which is there when we are not looking, consists of latent potential
643600	644600	experiences.
644600	652360	Now at first this might seem a bit odd, but let us think about what an experience really
652360	654040	is.
654040	659840	It is the feeling of a relationship between ourselves and the objects which constitute
659840	660840	the world.
660840	669480	Thus to say that matter is comprised of potential or latent experiences is to say that the objectivity
669480	677600	of matter consists precisely in its potential for coming into such relationships.
677600	684640	In simply following through more fully on the implications hidden within Cartesian dualism,
684640	691520	Bergson thus came to essentially turn inside out the Cartesian and Kantian formulations
691520	697640	of the bifurcation of nature, such that mind and matter were now seen to be necessarily
697640	701480	codependent and interpenetrating.
701480	707440	After all, what else could matter possibly be other than experiences that have yet to
707440	710800	become actualized?
710800	716480	There are many implications which then unfold from re-synthesizing mind and matter in this
716480	717560	way.
717560	723800	In following Bergson we can see that subjectivity is in fact a fundamental aspect of reality
723800	732320	itself, and that complex minds such as our own do not in fact have a monopoly on experience.
732320	738840	And following through on the ontological implications of the nature of our own existence, we come
738840	746400	to see that experience itself is in fact a fundamental aspect of the world itself.
746400	752280	Bergson would then go on to formulate a very different sort of fundamental dichotomy, not
752280	758400	between mind and matter, but rather between the mechanical and the organic.
758400	764280	For Bergson, mechanical causation is that in which an event is determined entirely by
764280	770720	preceding events, as in the case of falling dominoes or billiard balls bouncing off of
770720	772280	one another.
772280	778640	It is the realm of the mechanistic that science has striven to prioritize since its initial
778640	785080	conception within Cartesian philosophy, but science often overextends itself in attempting
785080	792240	to describe the organic aspects of reality, as though the organic were merely a more complex
792240	795480	form of the mechanistic.
795480	801280	Rather Bergson saw the organic as always being in a kind of dynamic relationship with the
801280	804680	past or the future, or both.
804680	811400	It is not only the immediately preceding moment which determines an organic behavior, but
811400	817960	rather organic systems are able to draw from a kind of embodied memory, which extends much
817960	820960	further into the past.
820960	827000	Organic activity is therefore much more than the mechanistic sequence of immediately prior
827000	831960	events determining immediately subsequent events.
831960	837120	We see this concept illustrated by these cone-like diagrams, which Bergson employed
837120	839280	within matter and memory.
839280	844760	We can also see that these cones can stretch upward as well as downward, indicating that
844760	851120	organisms are also capable of bringing possible futures into relation with the present in
851120	856540	much the same way that they are able to bring the past into relation with the present.
856540	862700	It would be this Bergsonian conception of organic memory, which would later inspire Rupert
862700	868100	Sheldrake's development of Morphic Resonance Theory, which we explored in a previous series
868100	869900	on this channel.
869900	874780	Tufts University biologist Michael Levin has also employed very similar ideas and even
874780	880460	very similar diagrammatic illustrations in his theoretical work regarding what he has
880460	884500	dubbed cognitive light cones.
884500	889660	What is most significant for our purposes here, however, is the manner in which Bergson's
889660	897660	metaphysics collapses mind and matter back into one another in such a manner that experientiality
897660	902500	is seen to be a fundamental aspect of nature itself.
902500	908380	In correspondence to this fusion of mind and matter, there is also a correlative fissioning
908380	912500	apart of the organic and the mechanistic.
912500	920420	Rather than seeing organisms as squishy, complex machines, Bergson saw a very real divide between
920420	928140	processes which were merely mechanistic and those which were genuinely alive, organic,
928140	929140	or animate.
929140	935020	But now I want us to turn our attention to a philosopher who would go even further than
935020	942380	Bergson or any other thinker in his attempt to mend the Cartesian rupture between mind
942380	949500	and matter and who would lay the groundwork for what is today an entire field of philosophy,
949500	954980	now known often as process philosophy or process metaphysics.
954980	960740	Here I am referring to the British mathematician and metaphysician Alfred North Whitehead,
960740	965580	one of the single most titanic figures within the early development of what we now term
965580	972660	analytic philosophy but who described his own philosophical system not as process philosophy
972660	979620	nor as analytic philosophy but rather as a philosophy of organism.
979620	986020	Whitehead himself was very closely interested and involved within the developments of physics
986020	990260	which had begun to take shape in the early 20th century.
990300	996780	This would culminate in what we now refer to as quantum electrodynamics or quantum field
996780	1001460	theory as well as the theory of general relativity.
1001460	1006860	Both Henri Bergson and Whitehead would be very outspoken critics of what they saw as
1006860	1013180	the implicit metaphysics of Einstein's general relativity and Whitehead himself would develop
1013180	1019380	an alternative conception of gravity and relativity which he believed would avoid the pitfalls
1019420	1025660	of Einstein's conception particularly the so-called black holes which Einstein himself
1025660	1031980	believed to be a refutation of his own conception of relativity rather than a natural inference
1031980	1034020	from it.
1034020	1039940	But overall Whitehead was a thinker who perhaps more so than any other thinker of his own time
1039940	1044740	or sense saw the writing on the walls very clearly.
1044740	1049860	The metaphysical paradigm which had dominated science since the days of Descartes simply
1049860	1055500	would not survive the developments in physics which were now being substantiated by precise
1055500	1059780	measurements and experimental observations.
1059780	1066580	The Enlightenment vision of the clockwork universe and clockmaker god were no longer
1066580	1071060	adequate in accounting for the world which was coming to be revealed by the science which
1071060	1074220	had stemmed from that vision.
1074220	1079980	A new vision was needed as was a new conceptual framework and Whitehead would set himself
1079980	1084660	the task of developing just such a conceptual system.
1084660	1090820	In 1924 Whitehead would relocate to the United States where at Harvard University he would
1090820	1094980	begin his philosophical project in earnest.
1094980	1100260	In 1925 Whitehead would publish Science and the Modern World in which Whitehead would
1100260	1106820	begin developing his critique of and alternative to Cartesian dualism.
1106820	1115020	In 1927 Whitehead would present his more formalized ideas as a series of lectures which in 1929
1115020	1118780	would be published as Process and Reality.
1118780	1124060	A work which is now generally considered to be Whitehead's magnum opus and the most rigorous
1124060	1131420	articulation of the metaphysical scheme which he had come to develop.
1131420	1136260	Alright guys so I am not going to sugarcoat this, I am about to throw some very dense
1136260	1142140	and nuanced terminology at you guys that will probably seem very alien and counterintuitive
1142140	1146540	if you've never encountered Whitehead's ideas before so bear with me.
1146540	1152380	There is a bit of jargon to unpack here but these ideas really are not that complicated.
1152380	1157500	Because they seem difficult it's not because any of this is particularly arcane or bizarre
1157500	1164820	rather it's because of how dramatically Whitehead's ideas stand in contrast to the implicit presumptions
1164820	1172140	which remain the accepted doctrines of the post-Cartesian Modernist worldview.
1172140	1176980	As previously mentioned Whitehead refers to the system developed in Process and Reality
1176980	1183700	as a philosophy of organism and this nomenclature indicates that Whitehead had come to see the
1183700	1190500	fundamental nature of the world as organic rather than consisting fundamentally of lifeless
1190500	1197140	inert material as implied by the Cartesian paradigm which he sought to subvert.
1197140	1202380	In Process and Reality Whitehead is attempting to rigorously describe a reality which he
1202380	1208620	saw as inexorably alive even at the most basic level.
1208620	1214540	Most central to Whitehead's system is a concept which he refers to as concrescence,
1214540	1220780	a term which refers to what Whitehead saw as the fundamental nature of time.
1220780	1228540	Concrescence implies a synthesis or coming together of actualities and potentialities
1228620	1235340	which thereby come to concretize and thus form the basic units of the world
1235340	1247260	which he variously termed actual occasions, actual entities or electromagnetic occasions of experience.
1247260	1253340	As we also saw in Bergson's metaphysics we can see in Whitehead's scheme the implication that
1253340	1260780	reality is characterized by both objectivity and subjectivity even at the most basic level.
1260780	1265580	But moreover Whitehead is also indicating that the most basic elements of the world
1265580	1274460	are events rather than enduring material objects. Rather than picturing nature as made up of tiny
1274460	1280380	BBs bouncing around in the void, Whitehead was taking the implications of quantum physics
1280380	1287420	seriously and thus concluding that the fundamental entities of the world are processes rather than
1287420	1295260	material bodies. An actual event is formed by the process of concrescence and the nature of
1295260	1302460	that process is determined by relationships which Whitehead calls prehensions. The word
1302460	1310220	prehensions, similar to the word apprehension, etymologically implies grasping or taking up.
1311260	1318460	Prehensions are the basic forms of interaction which give shape to actual events and allow for
1318460	1325660	the achievement of determinacy from distributions or fields of indeterminacy.
1326540	1332780	This concretization corresponds to what physicists would describe as wave function collapse.
1333820	1339660	Whitehead describes three types of prehension, physical prehension, conceptual prehension,
1339660	1345420	and hybrid prehension. These are the basic components of what Whitehead describes as a
1345420	1352140	theory of feelings. I'm going to briefly describe the first two types of prehension here but the
1352140	1356540	third type hybrid prehension is a bit more complicated and so that's something which we
1356540	1363020	will be coming back to in later videos. Physical prehension consists in relationships between
1363020	1369420	an organic process and actual occasions which have already occurred and which have thus already come
1369420	1377740	to be concretized as determinate events within the past. Past actualities contribute themselves
1377820	1384460	to a novel moment of creative genesis and this is the process which we commonly describe as
1384460	1393100	physical causation or efficient teleology to use Aristotelian terms. In contrast to physical
1393100	1400540	prehension we then have conceptual prehension. Conceptual prehension is the experience of
1400620	1408700	possibilities rather than past actualities. It is the feeling of real potentialities which are
1408700	1416940	available to a given concrescence, a given moment of experience. Whitehead describes these potentialities
1416940	1424780	as eternal objects which are essentially equivalent to platonic forms. They are the basic structures
1424780	1432940	or patterns which an event can incorporate into itself so as to thereby achieve concrete determinacy.
1433660	1439980	An occasion of concrescence is fundamentally an experiential decision in which the event
1440540	1447420	actively selects which possibilities come to give shape to it as it then concretizes
1447420	1454540	and then becomes a definite feature of the past. So let's now try to make sense of all that by
1454540	1460300	actually looking at how this scheme might map on to the basic features of our world.
1461100	1467180	Quantum mechanics describes the world as consisting fundamentally of fields and particles.
1467980	1473900	The word particle however is already itself something of an issue as the word particle
1473900	1479500	is something that we intuitively take to refer to a material body of some sort,
1479500	1486700	a physically enduring BB of some sort. As previously indicated, Whitehead's scheme is one
1486700	1494620	in which the basic elements are events rather than material bodies. You can find this conceptual
1494620	1500700	convolution present in almost any discussions pertaining to quantum mechanics. Physicists
1500700	1506940	speak of quantum particles as though they are physical bodies and with the next breath tell us
1506940	1514140	that these particles can be distributed throughout space, that they can be in various locations
1514140	1520860	at the same time. Particles are also described as point-like meaning that they are said to have
1520860	1527500	no physical extension in space even though they are also implied to be physical bodies
1527500	1533420	which have properties such as mass. Seen through Whitehead's conceptual scheme however,
1533420	1540460	what we instead find are distributions of real potentiality and fully determinate events.
1541340	1547900	For example, physicists will often describe the electron orbital shell of an atom as a
1547900	1555980	distribution of probability which radiates outward from the atomic nucleus. There is a material or
1555980	1563900	at least quasi-material body which we call the electron particle, but the so-called particle
1563900	1570380	exists throughout this distributional aura until a particular interaction event occurs,
1570380	1576460	at which point the electron will indeed come to be at a particular location in space,
1576460	1582780	at least for that particular moment. With in Whitehead's scheme however, there simply are no
1582780	1590620	material or quasi-material bodies which underlie such quantum phenomena. There are fields which
1590620	1597900	are distributions of possible events and then there are the actual events themselves, the
1597900	1606940	electromagnetic occasions of experience. These events are experiential, decisive and essentially
1606940	1615260	organic processes which can come to loop back upon themselves so as to form recurrent cyclical
1615260	1622860	oscillatory patterns, knots of electromagnetic process as it were, which when sufficiently
1622860	1629420	rigidified begin to behave in a manner analogous to what we would expect from enduring physical
1629420	1637020	bodies. The electronic field which surrounds the atom is thus not a particle which is in
1637020	1644300	numerous places all at once, but rather it is a range of possible locations in which electromagnetic
1644300	1652220	events could possibly occur. These events then condition the structure of future possibilities
1652220	1658220	and thus condition the nature of subsequent events, but this efficient determination is
1658220	1665020	never complete. The electromagnetic occasions of experience always have options and this is the
1665020	1672220	nature of the fundamental indeterminacy which we find in quantum electrodynamics. Within the
1672220	1678940	philosophy of organism, the basic structure of human experience is also the basic structure of the
1678940	1687500	world itself. We are living beings and reality itself shares in this character with us. There is
1687580	1694220	no introversible gulf between the nature of our own existence and the nature of the world.
1694860	1703500	To be a subject within an objective reality is simply to be a participant within the ongoing
1703500	1710940	creative advance of the cosmos which we are a part of. As Whitehead states in Science in the
1710940	1719340	Modern World, quote, biology is the study of the larger organisms, whereas physics is the study
1719340	1727260	of the smaller organisms, end quote. Quantum events are the most basic organic processes which
1727260	1735660	constitute the world and atoms are the most basic organisms, the most basic self-referential knots
1735660	1742620	comprised of such organic events. For Whitehead, nature is organic in the sense that it is
1742620	1751020	fundamentally experiential, but also in that it is fundamentally self-creative. It is characterized by
1751020	1760540	what the biologist Francisco Varela would call autopoiesis. For Whitehead, time itself is a creative
1760540	1768380	advance through which nature continually strives towards the actualization of ever more complex
1768380	1777580	and synergistic novelty. Mere mechanistic causation is the exception, not the rule, within such a
1777580	1786220	universe. Organic processes strive to sustain and perpetuate themselves, and in doing so come to
1787020	1795180	symbiotic relationships with one another, thereby giving rise to ever more complex organisms
1795180	1802860	with ever more richly nuanced experiences. Whitehead's paradigm is one in which biological
1802860	1811100	organisms are but one particular branch of a tree of life which includes atoms as well as stars,
1811180	1819500	planetary systems, and galaxies. At all levels what we find are self-organizing and self-creative
1819500	1827100	electromagnetic systems which come to synchronize the diversity of nature into complex living
1827100	1833980	unities. Now that all might sound like a bunch of poetic gobbledygook if you're new to these
1833980	1839980	ideas and I'm gonna abstain from making this video two hours long by unpacking them even further,
1839980	1845500	for now at least. However, if you want to see these principles in action, then I'd recommend
1845500	1851100	checking out my video series on Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance, in which I also talk
1851100	1857180	a bit about Michael Levin's research regarding bioelectricity. Both Sheldrake and Levin are
1857180	1863900	contemporary standard bearers for this more organismic conception of the world. I would also
1863900	1869660	recommend checking out some of the ideas developed by adherents of the Electric Universe model of
1869660	1878220	cosmology which has been an attempt to understand astrophysical phenomena in terms of electro-organic
1878220	1884380	self-organization. As data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope continues to make it
1884380	1893260	increasingly undeniable that our current mechanistic cosmology is in an inescapable crisis. I think it
1893260	1899660	is now more important than ever that we take very seriously the thinkers who saw in advance the
1899660	1905980	problems which are intrinsic to the underlying presumptions of modern science. Bergson and
1905980	1913580	Whitehead being only two of many such figures. Within an organismic rather than mechanistic
1913580	1921260	paradigm, we avoid the intractable problems of somehow deriving consciousness from inanimate
1921260	1928300	matter. As we can see that the world simply is not comprised of inanimate matter, but rather of
1928300	1935180	animate processes which are themselves already experiential in character. Consciousness and
1935180	1942540	existence are intertwined from their very foundations. We can see that we don't need to wait for some
1942540	1949980	arcane mathematical models in order to understand consciousness scientifically. Seen correctly,
1950060	1956060	disciplines such as biology and physics already are the study of consciousness.
1956940	1962380	I'll be leaving it at that for now, however, so thanks for watching and have a great week. I'll see
1962380	1966780	you in the next video.
