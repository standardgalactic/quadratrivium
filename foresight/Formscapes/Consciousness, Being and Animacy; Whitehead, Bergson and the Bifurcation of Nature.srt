Hi guys, so this video is part 2 of my previous video, so if you haven't seen that already

2
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:54,440
then you should consider checking that video out either before or after watching this one,

3
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,560
as it contains a great deal of context which you will probably find very illuminating.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,600
out and without any further ado, let's get into it.

6
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,840
Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.

7
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,640
What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.

8
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Alpha North Whitehead

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,760
Previously I described the ways in which Descartes' philosophy resulted in what we

10
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:39,480
could call a bifurcation of nature, which separated the world into two distinct metaphysical realms,

11
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,320
that of mind and that of matter.

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,760
But it was another philosopher who would see most clearly the problems which were developing

13
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:55,880
from this modernist post-Cartesian paradigm and who would codify many of the conceptual

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,080
elements which would come to characterize modern thought for centuries to come.

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,520
That philosopher was Immanuel Kant.

16
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,960
Through David Hume, Kant would come to see the true extent of the implications wrought

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,080
by Descartes' systematic skepticism.

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,320
If we cannot be certain that our experiences of the world actually coincide with a world

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:28,280
beyond our perceptions, then how can we justify any of our empirical claims about the world

20
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,720
at all?

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:37,480
How do we know that any of our scientific claims actually have any objective validity?

22
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,920
Consolidates such knowledge about the world would require more than empirical observation.

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,440
We can observe that the sun has risen every day up until now, but we cannot simply observe

24
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,400
a law which demands such regularity.

25
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,880
We must infer such laws, and thus empirical observation alone is not enough to actually

26
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,560
ground scientific knowledge.

27
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:11,640
Nor can we say that the constancy of the sun's behavior is dictated by logic, as Kant understood

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,320
logical truths, to apply only to relations of ideas rather than facts about the natural

29
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,280
world.

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,520
Kant's solution was to make a distinction, much like Descartes' distinction between

31
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:30,760
mind and matter, between what he termed phenomena and numina.

32
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,400
For Kant, the world of phenomena was the world of experience.

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,480
The phenomenal world is the world as we experience it, the world as it is conditioned by our

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
faculties of perception and understanding.

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,880
Kant saw that the human psyche itself played a crucial role in synthesizing our sense perceptions

36
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,440
together into intelligible experiences.

37
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Much like the way that the Copernican Revolution came to place the sun at the center of the

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,720
solar system, the Kantian Revolution placed the human psyche at the center of the world

39
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,000
which we actually experience.

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
According to Kant, we did not experience the world in itself, but rather experienced phenomena,

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,200
experiences of the world which were necessarily conditioned by the functioning of the human

42
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,080
mind in consistent ways.

43
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,840
By understanding the way that the human mind conditioned our experiences, Kant could in

44
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:43,600
a sense reclaim objectivity and thereby re-ground science in the wake of Cartesian and Humean

45
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,440
radical skepticism.

46
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,680
Hume had argued that we never actually experienced causation or time, and thus argued that we

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,000
inferred those aspects of reality in an irrational way.

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,840
Kant instead argued that space, time, and causality were all among a variety of categories

49
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,800
which the human mind necessarily used to condition our experiences of the world.

50
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:21,960
Space, time, and causation argued Kant were not necessarily aspects of the world in itself,

51
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,240
but were, at the very least, necessary aspects of the way that the human mind structures

52
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,520
our experiences of reality.

53
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:38,240
Those aspects were therefore necessary aspects of the phenomenal world, the world which we

54
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,360
experience, but not necessarily the world in itself.

55
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,680
But then what about the world as it actually is?

56
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,320
What about this presupposed ding on seek or thing in itself which Kant supposed to

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,640
lie somewhere behind or beneath the phenomenal world of experiences?

58
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,000
Within this Kantian understanding of reality, we never actually encounter the world as it

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,800
is in itself, but only phenomena.

60
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,280
The world itself is something which would thus seem to be forever beyond our reach.

61
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,720
We cannot go around our experiences to check if our experiences of the world actually correspond

62
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,280
to how the world actually is.

63
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,520
Although Kant believed that he had rescued science from radical skepticism, there remains

64
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,120
a looming epistemological nihilism behind Kant's ideas.

65
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,080
What if there is no world in itself?

66
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,840
If we, by definition, cannot encounter such a world?

67
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,880
Then what reason do we really have to believe that there is such a thing in itself at all?

68
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,680
Now of course this all might seem rather pedantic.

69
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,880
It seems rather obvious that there is indeed a world beyond our experiences of the world.

70
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,440
The world remains even after we look away and return our gaze to it.

71
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,840
Great walls stop foreheads regardless as to how our consciousness construes them.

72
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:26,240
But what we are seeing here in this problem is yet another unfolding of the deeply rooted

73
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,200
incoherence of the Cartesian worldview.

74
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,600
Constant demarcation of phenomena and numina is a kind of reformulation of the Cartesian

75
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,360
split between mind and matter.

76
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,720
Another split which would seem to create an infinitely vast and unbridgeable gulf between

77
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,360
our consciousness and the world which we inhabit.

78
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,760
Kant had no choice but to resign himself to a kind of epistemological quietism with regards

79
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,200
to the world beyond our senses.

80
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,320
He deeply held that there must be an actual world which exists independently of our experiences.

81
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,920
She saw no way to actually say anything about that world.

82
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:21,960
The world would have to remain forever beyond our grasp, an impenetrable mystery which would

83
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:26,560
always lie beyond the confines of our minds.

84
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,320
The paradigm of modern science presupposes that what lies beyond our consciousness is

85
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,200
something we call matter, which is supposed to be entirely objective in character, that

86
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,960
which exists independently of our senses.

87
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:49,680
Yet Kant had shown us that we can never actually encounter matter at all, but rather only our

88
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,120
experiences of an unknowable something which we can only presume to exist beyond our own

89
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,280
minds.

90
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,120
Following Kant, many philosophers would come to reject or reformulate Kant's distinction

91
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,200
between phenomena and numina in such a way that this intractable gulf could be mended.

92
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,160
One of those philosophers was Henri Bergson, initially educated as a mathematician and

93
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,960
later developing an acute interest in the French spiritualism movement, which would

94
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,960
also give us figures such as Jean Gebseur.

95
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,400
Henri Bergson rejected outright the Cartesian conception of mind as a kind of screen, which

96
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:38,880
separated us intractably from a world which was believed to be entirely devoid of consciousness.

97
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,520
In aiming for the heart of this issue, Bergson asks us in his monumental work, Matter and

98
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Memory, to think about what matter must actually be given the way in which we actually experience

99
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,880
the world around us.

100
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:59,600
We begin with our experiences of the world.

101
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,400
We can then divert our attention from the world temporarily and return to see that the

102
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,760
objects of the world yet remain.

103
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,960
We thus rightly conclude that the world is not merely a projection of our minds, there

104
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:19,760
is something out there as it were, which is provided to our consciousness.

105
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,880
So what exactly is it that is provided by the world?

106
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,600
The answer is, of course, experiences.

107
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:35,200
There is never anything extra which we encounter by definition, and thus Bergson concludes

108
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:43,600
that matter, that which is there when we are not looking, consists of latent potential

109
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
experiences.

110
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:52,360
Now at first this might seem a bit odd, but let us think about what an experience really

111
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,040
is.

112
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,840
It is the feeling of a relationship between ourselves and the objects which constitute

113
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
the world.

114
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:09,480
Thus to say that matter is comprised of potential or latent experiences is to say that the objectivity

115
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:17,600
of matter consists precisely in its potential for coming into such relationships.

116
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,640
In simply following through more fully on the implications hidden within Cartesian dualism,

117
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,520
Bergson thus came to essentially turn inside out the Cartesian and Kantian formulations

118
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:37,640
of the bifurcation of nature, such that mind and matter were now seen to be necessarily

119
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,480
codependent and interpenetrating.

120
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,440
After all, what else could matter possibly be other than experiences that have yet to

121
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,800
become actualized?

122
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,480
There are many implications which then unfold from re-synthesizing mind and matter in this

123
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,560
way.

124
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:03,800
In following Bergson we can see that subjectivity is in fact a fundamental aspect of reality

125
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:12,320
itself, and that complex minds such as our own do not in fact have a monopoly on experience.

126
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,840
And following through on the ontological implications of the nature of our own existence, we come

127
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:26,400
to see that experience itself is in fact a fundamental aspect of the world itself.

128
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:32,280
Bergson would then go on to formulate a very different sort of fundamental dichotomy, not

129
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:38,400
between mind and matter, but rather between the mechanical and the organic.

130
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,280
For Bergson, mechanical causation is that in which an event is determined entirely by

131
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,720
preceding events, as in the case of falling dominoes or billiard balls bouncing off of

132
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,280
one another.

133
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,640
It is the realm of the mechanistic that science has striven to prioritize since its initial

134
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:05,080
conception within Cartesian philosophy, but science often overextends itself in attempting

135
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,240
to describe the organic aspects of reality, as though the organic were merely a more complex

136
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,480
form of the mechanistic.

137
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,280
Rather Bergson saw the organic as always being in a kind of dynamic relationship with the

138
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,680
past or the future, or both.

139
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,400
It is not only the immediately preceding moment which determines an organic behavior, but

140
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:37,960
rather organic systems are able to draw from a kind of embodied memory, which extends much

141
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,960
further into the past.

142
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:47,000
Organic activity is therefore much more than the mechanistic sequence of immediately prior

143
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,960
events determining immediately subsequent events.

144
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,120
We see this concept illustrated by these cone-like diagrams, which Bergson employed

145
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,280
within matter and memory.

146
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,760
We can also see that these cones can stretch upward as well as downward, indicating that

147
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:11,120
organisms are also capable of bringing possible futures into relation with the present in

148
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,540
much the same way that they are able to bring the past into relation with the present.

149
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,700
It would be this Bergsonian conception of organic memory, which would later inspire Rupert

150
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,100
Sheldrake's development of Morphic Resonance Theory, which we explored in a previous series

151
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,900
on this channel.

152
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,780
Tufts University biologist Michael Levin has also employed very similar ideas and even

153
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:40,460
very similar diagrammatic illustrations in his theoretical work regarding what he has

154
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:44,500
dubbed cognitive light cones.

155
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,660
What is most significant for our purposes here, however, is the manner in which Bergson's

156
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:57,660
metaphysics collapses mind and matter back into one another in such a manner that experientiality

157
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,500
is seen to be a fundamental aspect of nature itself.

158
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:08,380
In correspondence to this fusion of mind and matter, there is also a correlative fissioning

159
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,500
apart of the organic and the mechanistic.

160
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:20,420
Rather than seeing organisms as squishy, complex machines, Bergson saw a very real divide between

161
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:28,140
processes which were merely mechanistic and those which were genuinely alive, organic,

162
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
or animate.

163
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,020
But now I want us to turn our attention to a philosopher who would go even further than

164
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:42,380
Bergson or any other thinker in his attempt to mend the Cartesian rupture between mind

165
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:49,500
and matter and who would lay the groundwork for what is today an entire field of philosophy,

166
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,980
now known often as process philosophy or process metaphysics.

167
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,740
Here I am referring to the British mathematician and metaphysician Alfred North Whitehead,

168
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,580
one of the single most titanic figures within the early development of what we now term

169
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:12,660
analytic philosophy but who described his own philosophical system not as process philosophy

170
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,620
nor as analytic philosophy but rather as a philosophy of organism.

171
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,020
Whitehead himself was very closely interested and involved within the developments of physics

172
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:30,260
which had begun to take shape in the early 20th century.

173
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,780
This would culminate in what we now refer to as quantum electrodynamics or quantum field

174
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,460
theory as well as the theory of general relativity.

175
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,860
Both Henri Bergson and Whitehead would be very outspoken critics of what they saw as

176
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:53,180
the implicit metaphysics of Einstein's general relativity and Whitehead himself would develop

177
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:59,380
an alternative conception of gravity and relativity which he believed would avoid the pitfalls

178
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,660
of Einstein's conception particularly the so-called black holes which Einstein himself

179
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:11,980
believed to be a refutation of his own conception of relativity rather than a natural inference

180
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,020
from it.

181
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:19,940
But overall Whitehead was a thinker who perhaps more so than any other thinker of his own time

182
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:24,740
or sense saw the writing on the walls very clearly.

183
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,860
The metaphysical paradigm which had dominated science since the days of Descartes simply

184
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,500
would not survive the developments in physics which were now being substantiated by precise

185
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,780
measurements and experimental observations.

186
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:46,580
The Enlightenment vision of the clockwork universe and clockmaker god were no longer

187
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,060
adequate in accounting for the world which was coming to be revealed by the science which

188
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,220
had stemmed from that vision.

189
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,980
A new vision was needed as was a new conceptual framework and Whitehead would set himself

190
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,660
the task of developing just such a conceptual system.

191
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,820
In 1924 Whitehead would relocate to the United States where at Harvard University he would

192
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,980
begin his philosophical project in earnest.

193
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,260
In 1925 Whitehead would publish Science and the Modern World in which Whitehead would

194
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,820
begin developing his critique of and alternative to Cartesian dualism.

195
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:35,020
In 1927 Whitehead would present his more formalized ideas as a series of lectures which in 1929

196
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,780
would be published as Process and Reality.

197
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,060
A work which is now generally considered to be Whitehead's magnum opus and the most rigorous

198
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:51,420
articulation of the metaphysical scheme which he had come to develop.

199
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,260
Alright guys so I am not going to sugarcoat this, I am about to throw some very dense

200
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:02,140
and nuanced terminology at you guys that will probably seem very alien and counterintuitive

201
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,540
if you've never encountered Whitehead's ideas before so bear with me.

202
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,380
There is a bit of jargon to unpack here but these ideas really are not that complicated.

203
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,500
Because they seem difficult it's not because any of this is particularly arcane or bizarre

204
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:24,820
rather it's because of how dramatically Whitehead's ideas stand in contrast to the implicit presumptions

205
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:32,140
which remain the accepted doctrines of the post-Cartesian Modernist worldview.

206
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:36,980
As previously mentioned Whitehead refers to the system developed in Process and Reality

207
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:43,700
as a philosophy of organism and this nomenclature indicates that Whitehead had come to see the

208
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:50,500
fundamental nature of the world as organic rather than consisting fundamentally of lifeless

209
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:57,140
inert material as implied by the Cartesian paradigm which he sought to subvert.

210
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:02,380
In Process and Reality Whitehead is attempting to rigorously describe a reality which he

211
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:08,620
saw as inexorably alive even at the most basic level.

212
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,540
Most central to Whitehead's system is a concept which he refers to as concrescence,

213
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:20,780
a term which refers to what Whitehead saw as the fundamental nature of time.

214
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:28,540
Concrescence implies a synthesis or coming together of actualities and potentialities

215
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:35,340
which thereby come to concretize and thus form the basic units of the world

216
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:47,260
which he variously termed actual occasions, actual entities or electromagnetic occasions of experience.

217
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:53,340
As we also saw in Bergson's metaphysics we can see in Whitehead's scheme the implication that

218
00:20:53,340 --> 00:21:00,780
reality is characterized by both objectivity and subjectivity even at the most basic level.

219
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,580
But moreover Whitehead is also indicating that the most basic elements of the world

220
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:14,460
are events rather than enduring material objects. Rather than picturing nature as made up of tiny

221
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,380
BBs bouncing around in the void, Whitehead was taking the implications of quantum physics

222
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:27,420
seriously and thus concluding that the fundamental entities of the world are processes rather than

223
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:35,260
material bodies. An actual event is formed by the process of concrescence and the nature of

224
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:42,460
that process is determined by relationships which Whitehead calls prehensions. The word

225
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:50,220
prehensions, similar to the word apprehension, etymologically implies grasping or taking up.

226
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:58,460
Prehensions are the basic forms of interaction which give shape to actual events and allow for

227
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:05,660
the achievement of determinacy from distributions or fields of indeterminacy.

228
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:12,780
This concretization corresponds to what physicists would describe as wave function collapse.

229
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:19,660
Whitehead describes three types of prehension, physical prehension, conceptual prehension,

230
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:25,420
and hybrid prehension. These are the basic components of what Whitehead describes as a

231
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:32,140
theory of feelings. I'm going to briefly describe the first two types of prehension here but the

232
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,540
third type hybrid prehension is a bit more complicated and so that's something which we

233
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:43,020
will be coming back to in later videos. Physical prehension consists in relationships between

234
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:49,420
an organic process and actual occasions which have already occurred and which have thus already come

235
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:57,740
to be concretized as determinate events within the past. Past actualities contribute themselves

236
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:04,460
to a novel moment of creative genesis and this is the process which we commonly describe as

237
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:13,100
physical causation or efficient teleology to use Aristotelian terms. In contrast to physical

238
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:20,540
prehension we then have conceptual prehension. Conceptual prehension is the experience of

239
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:28,700
possibilities rather than past actualities. It is the feeling of real potentialities which are

240
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:36,940
available to a given concrescence, a given moment of experience. Whitehead describes these potentialities

241
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:44,780
as eternal objects which are essentially equivalent to platonic forms. They are the basic structures

242
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:52,940
or patterns which an event can incorporate into itself so as to thereby achieve concrete determinacy.

243
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,980
An occasion of concrescence is fundamentally an experiential decision in which the event

244
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:07,420
actively selects which possibilities come to give shape to it as it then concretizes

245
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:14,540
and then becomes a definite feature of the past. So let's now try to make sense of all that by

246
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:20,300
actually looking at how this scheme might map on to the basic features of our world.

247
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:27,180
Quantum mechanics describes the world as consisting fundamentally of fields and particles.

248
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:33,900
The word particle however is already itself something of an issue as the word particle

249
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:39,500
is something that we intuitively take to refer to a material body of some sort,

250
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:46,700
a physically enduring BB of some sort. As previously indicated, Whitehead's scheme is one

251
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:54,620
in which the basic elements are events rather than material bodies. You can find this conceptual

252
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:00,700
convolution present in almost any discussions pertaining to quantum mechanics. Physicists

253
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,940
speak of quantum particles as though they are physical bodies and with the next breath tell us

254
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:14,140
that these particles can be distributed throughout space, that they can be in various locations

255
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:20,860
at the same time. Particles are also described as point-like meaning that they are said to have

256
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:27,500
no physical extension in space even though they are also implied to be physical bodies

257
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:33,420
which have properties such as mass. Seen through Whitehead's conceptual scheme however,

258
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:40,460
what we instead find are distributions of real potentiality and fully determinate events.

259
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:47,900
For example, physicists will often describe the electron orbital shell of an atom as a

260
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:55,980
distribution of probability which radiates outward from the atomic nucleus. There is a material or

261
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:03,900
at least quasi-material body which we call the electron particle, but the so-called particle

262
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:10,380
exists throughout this distributional aura until a particular interaction event occurs,

263
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,460
at which point the electron will indeed come to be at a particular location in space,

264
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,780
at least for that particular moment. With in Whitehead's scheme however, there simply are no

265
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:30,620
material or quasi-material bodies which underlie such quantum phenomena. There are fields which

266
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:37,900
are distributions of possible events and then there are the actual events themselves, the

267
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:46,940
electromagnetic occasions of experience. These events are experiential, decisive and essentially

268
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:55,260
organic processes which can come to loop back upon themselves so as to form recurrent cyclical

269
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:02,860
oscillatory patterns, knots of electromagnetic process as it were, which when sufficiently

270
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:09,420
rigidified begin to behave in a manner analogous to what we would expect from enduring physical

271
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:17,020
bodies. The electronic field which surrounds the atom is thus not a particle which is in

272
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:24,300
numerous places all at once, but rather it is a range of possible locations in which electromagnetic

273
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:32,220
events could possibly occur. These events then condition the structure of future possibilities

274
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:38,220
and thus condition the nature of subsequent events, but this efficient determination is

275
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:45,020
never complete. The electromagnetic occasions of experience always have options and this is the

276
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:52,220
nature of the fundamental indeterminacy which we find in quantum electrodynamics. Within the

277
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:58,940
philosophy of organism, the basic structure of human experience is also the basic structure of the

278
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:07,500
world itself. We are living beings and reality itself shares in this character with us. There is

279
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:14,220
no introversible gulf between the nature of our own existence and the nature of the world.

280
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:23,500
To be a subject within an objective reality is simply to be a participant within the ongoing

281
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,940
creative advance of the cosmos which we are a part of. As Whitehead states in Science in the

282
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:39,340
Modern World, quote, biology is the study of the larger organisms, whereas physics is the study

283
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:47,260
of the smaller organisms, end quote. Quantum events are the most basic organic processes which

284
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:55,660
constitute the world and atoms are the most basic organisms, the most basic self-referential knots

285
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,620
comprised of such organic events. For Whitehead, nature is organic in the sense that it is

286
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:11,020
fundamentally experiential, but also in that it is fundamentally self-creative. It is characterized by

287
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:20,540
what the biologist Francisco Varela would call autopoiesis. For Whitehead, time itself is a creative

288
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:28,380
advance through which nature continually strives towards the actualization of ever more complex

289
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:37,580
and synergistic novelty. Mere mechanistic causation is the exception, not the rule, within such a

290
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:46,220
universe. Organic processes strive to sustain and perpetuate themselves, and in doing so come to

291
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:55,180
symbiotic relationships with one another, thereby giving rise to ever more complex organisms

292
00:29:55,180 --> 00:30:02,860
with ever more richly nuanced experiences. Whitehead's paradigm is one in which biological

293
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:11,100
organisms are but one particular branch of a tree of life which includes atoms as well as stars,

294
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:19,500
planetary systems, and galaxies. At all levels what we find are self-organizing and self-creative

295
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:27,100
electromagnetic systems which come to synchronize the diversity of nature into complex living

296
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:33,980
unities. Now that all might sound like a bunch of poetic gobbledygook if you're new to these

297
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:39,980
ideas and I'm gonna abstain from making this video two hours long by unpacking them even further,

298
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:45,500
for now at least. However, if you want to see these principles in action, then I'd recommend

299
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:51,100
checking out my video series on Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance, in which I also talk

300
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:57,180
a bit about Michael Levin's research regarding bioelectricity. Both Sheldrake and Levin are

301
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:03,900
contemporary standard bearers for this more organismic conception of the world. I would also

302
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,660
recommend checking out some of the ideas developed by adherents of the Electric Universe model of

303
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:18,220
cosmology which has been an attempt to understand astrophysical phenomena in terms of electro-organic

304
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:24,380
self-organization. As data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope continues to make it

305
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:33,260
increasingly undeniable that our current mechanistic cosmology is in an inescapable crisis. I think it

306
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:39,660
is now more important than ever that we take very seriously the thinkers who saw in advance the

307
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:45,980
problems which are intrinsic to the underlying presumptions of modern science. Bergson and

308
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:53,580
Whitehead being only two of many such figures. Within an organismic rather than mechanistic

309
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:01,260
paradigm, we avoid the intractable problems of somehow deriving consciousness from inanimate

310
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:08,300
matter. As we can see that the world simply is not comprised of inanimate matter, but rather of

311
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:15,180
animate processes which are themselves already experiential in character. Consciousness and

312
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:22,540
existence are intertwined from their very foundations. We can see that we don't need to wait for some

313
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:29,980
arcane mathematical models in order to understand consciousness scientifically. Seen correctly,

314
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:36,060
disciplines such as biology and physics already are the study of consciousness.

315
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,380
I'll be leaving it at that for now, however, so thanks for watching and have a great week. I'll see

316
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,780
you in the next video.
