Hi guys, so this video is part 2 of my previous video, so if you haven't seen that already

00:49.540 --> 00:54.440
then you should consider checking that video out either before or after watching this one,

00:54.440 --> 00:58.560
as it contains a great deal of context which you will probably find very illuminating.

00:58.560 --> 01:02.200
Be sure to like and subscribe and consider subscribing to my Patreon if you want to help

01:02.200 --> 01:08.600
out and without any further ado, let's get into it.

01:08.600 --> 01:16.840
Every scientific man in order to preserve his reputation has to say he dislikes metaphysics.

01:16.840 --> 01:22.640
What he means is he dislikes having his metaphysics criticized.

01:22.760 --> 01:25.760
Alpha North Whitehead

01:25.760 --> 01:30.760
Previously I described the ways in which Descartes' philosophy resulted in what we

01:30.760 --> 01:39.480
could call a bifurcation of nature, which separated the world into two distinct metaphysical realms,

01:39.480 --> 01:43.320
that of mind and that of matter.

01:43.320 --> 01:48.760
But it was another philosopher who would see most clearly the problems which were developing

01:48.760 --> 01:55.880
from this modernist post-Cartesian paradigm and who would codify many of the conceptual

01:55.880 --> 02:01.080
elements which would come to characterize modern thought for centuries to come.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.520
That philosopher was Immanuel Kant.

02:04.520 --> 02:09.960
Through David Hume, Kant would come to see the true extent of the implications wrought

02:09.960 --> 02:14.080
by Descartes' systematic skepticism.

02:14.080 --> 02:20.320
If we cannot be certain that our experiences of the world actually coincide with a world

02:20.320 --> 02:28.280
beyond our perceptions, then how can we justify any of our empirical claims about the world

02:28.280 --> 02:29.720
at all?

02:29.720 --> 02:37.480
How do we know that any of our scientific claims actually have any objective validity?

02:37.480 --> 02:43.920
Consolidates such knowledge about the world would require more than empirical observation.

02:43.920 --> 02:51.440
We can observe that the sun has risen every day up until now, but we cannot simply observe

02:51.440 --> 02:55.400
a law which demands such regularity.

02:55.400 --> 03:01.880
We must infer such laws, and thus empirical observation alone is not enough to actually

03:01.880 --> 03:05.560
ground scientific knowledge.

03:05.560 --> 03:11.640
Nor can we say that the constancy of the sun's behavior is dictated by logic, as Kant understood

03:11.680 --> 03:18.320
logical truths, to apply only to relations of ideas rather than facts about the natural

03:18.320 --> 03:20.280
world.

03:20.280 --> 03:24.520
Kant's solution was to make a distinction, much like Descartes' distinction between

03:24.520 --> 03:30.760
mind and matter, between what he termed phenomena and numina.

03:30.760 --> 03:35.400
For Kant, the world of phenomena was the world of experience.

03:35.400 --> 03:42.480
The phenomenal world is the world as we experience it, the world as it is conditioned by our

03:42.480 --> 03:46.480
faculties of perception and understanding.

03:46.480 --> 03:52.880
Kant saw that the human psyche itself played a crucial role in synthesizing our sense perceptions

03:52.880 --> 03:57.440
together into intelligible experiences.

03:57.440 --> 04:02.400
Much like the way that the Copernican Revolution came to place the sun at the center of the

04:02.400 --> 04:08.720
solar system, the Kantian Revolution placed the human psyche at the center of the world

04:08.720 --> 04:12.000
which we actually experience.

04:12.000 --> 04:21.000
According to Kant, we did not experience the world in itself, but rather experienced phenomena,

04:21.000 --> 04:26.200
experiences of the world which were necessarily conditioned by the functioning of the human

04:26.200 --> 04:29.080
mind in consistent ways.

04:29.080 --> 04:34.840
By understanding the way that the human mind conditioned our experiences, Kant could in

04:34.840 --> 04:43.600
a sense reclaim objectivity and thereby re-ground science in the wake of Cartesian and Humean

04:43.600 --> 04:46.440
radical skepticism.

04:46.440 --> 04:53.680
Hume had argued that we never actually experienced causation or time, and thus argued that we

04:53.680 --> 05:00.000
inferred those aspects of reality in an irrational way.

05:00.000 --> 05:06.840
Kant instead argued that space, time, and causality were all among a variety of categories

05:06.840 --> 05:13.800
which the human mind necessarily used to condition our experiences of the world.

05:13.800 --> 05:21.960
Space, time, and causation argued Kant were not necessarily aspects of the world in itself,

05:21.960 --> 05:28.240
but were, at the very least, necessary aspects of the way that the human mind structures

05:28.240 --> 05:31.520
our experiences of reality.

05:31.520 --> 05:38.240
Those aspects were therefore necessary aspects of the phenomenal world, the world which we

05:38.240 --> 05:44.360
experience, but not necessarily the world in itself.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.680
But then what about the world as it actually is?

05:47.680 --> 05:54.320
What about this presupposed ding on seek or thing in itself which Kant supposed to

05:54.320 --> 06:01.640
lie somewhere behind or beneath the phenomenal world of experiences?

06:01.640 --> 06:07.000
Within this Kantian understanding of reality, we never actually encounter the world as it

06:07.000 --> 06:10.800
is in itself, but only phenomena.

06:10.800 --> 06:17.280
The world itself is something which would thus seem to be forever beyond our reach.

06:17.280 --> 06:24.720
We cannot go around our experiences to check if our experiences of the world actually correspond

06:24.720 --> 06:28.280
to how the world actually is.

06:28.280 --> 06:34.520
Although Kant believed that he had rescued science from radical skepticism, there remains

06:34.520 --> 06:41.120
a looming epistemological nihilism behind Kant's ideas.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.080
What if there is no world in itself?

06:45.080 --> 06:49.840
If we, by definition, cannot encounter such a world?

06:49.840 --> 06:56.880
Then what reason do we really have to believe that there is such a thing in itself at all?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.680
Now of course this all might seem rather pedantic.

06:59.680 --> 07:06.880
It seems rather obvious that there is indeed a world beyond our experiences of the world.

07:06.880 --> 07:13.440
The world remains even after we look away and return our gaze to it.

07:13.440 --> 07:19.840
Great walls stop foreheads regardless as to how our consciousness construes them.

07:19.840 --> 07:26.240
But what we are seeing here in this problem is yet another unfolding of the deeply rooted

07:26.240 --> 07:31.200
incoherence of the Cartesian worldview.

07:31.200 --> 07:37.600
Constant demarcation of phenomena and numina is a kind of reformulation of the Cartesian

07:37.600 --> 07:41.360
split between mind and matter.

07:41.360 --> 07:48.720
Another split which would seem to create an infinitely vast and unbridgeable gulf between

07:48.720 --> 07:53.360
our consciousness and the world which we inhabit.

07:53.360 --> 07:59.760
Kant had no choice but to resign himself to a kind of epistemological quietism with regards

07:59.760 --> 08:02.200
to the world beyond our senses.

08:02.200 --> 08:09.320
He deeply held that there must be an actual world which exists independently of our experiences.

08:09.400 --> 08:14.920
She saw no way to actually say anything about that world.

08:14.920 --> 08:21.960
The world would have to remain forever beyond our grasp, an impenetrable mystery which would

08:21.960 --> 08:26.560
always lie beyond the confines of our minds.

08:26.560 --> 08:32.320
The paradigm of modern science presupposes that what lies beyond our consciousness is

08:32.320 --> 08:39.200
something we call matter, which is supposed to be entirely objective in character, that

08:39.200 --> 08:42.960
which exists independently of our senses.

08:42.960 --> 08:49.680
Yet Kant had shown us that we can never actually encounter matter at all, but rather only our

08:49.680 --> 08:57.120
experiences of an unknowable something which we can only presume to exist beyond our own

08:57.120 --> 08:59.280
minds.

08:59.280 --> 09:04.120
Following Kant, many philosophers would come to reject or reformulate Kant's distinction

09:04.120 --> 09:11.200
between phenomena and numina in such a way that this intractable gulf could be mended.

09:11.200 --> 09:17.160
One of those philosophers was Henri Bergson, initially educated as a mathematician and

09:17.160 --> 09:21.960
later developing an acute interest in the French spiritualism movement, which would

09:21.960 --> 09:24.960
also give us figures such as Jean Gebseur.

09:24.960 --> 09:31.400
Henri Bergson rejected outright the Cartesian conception of mind as a kind of screen, which

09:31.400 --> 09:38.880
separated us intractably from a world which was believed to be entirely devoid of consciousness.

09:38.880 --> 09:45.520
In aiming for the heart of this issue, Bergson asks us in his monumental work, Matter and

09:45.520 --> 09:53.400
Memory, to think about what matter must actually be given the way in which we actually experience

09:53.480 --> 09:55.880
the world around us.

09:55.880 --> 09:59.600
We begin with our experiences of the world.

09:59.600 --> 10:04.400
We can then divert our attention from the world temporarily and return to see that the

10:04.400 --> 10:07.760
objects of the world yet remain.

10:07.760 --> 10:12.960
We thus rightly conclude that the world is not merely a projection of our minds, there

10:12.960 --> 10:19.760
is something out there as it were, which is provided to our consciousness.

10:19.760 --> 10:24.880
So what exactly is it that is provided by the world?

10:24.880 --> 10:28.600
The answer is, of course, experiences.

10:28.600 --> 10:35.200
There is never anything extra which we encounter by definition, and thus Bergson concludes

10:35.200 --> 10:43.600
that matter, that which is there when we are not looking, consists of latent potential

10:43.600 --> 10:44.600
experiences.

10:44.600 --> 10:52.360
Now at first this might seem a bit odd, but let us think about what an experience really

10:52.360 --> 10:54.040
is.

10:54.040 --> 10:59.840
It is the feeling of a relationship between ourselves and the objects which constitute

10:59.840 --> 11:00.840
the world.

11:00.840 --> 11:09.480
Thus to say that matter is comprised of potential or latent experiences is to say that the objectivity

11:09.480 --> 11:17.600
of matter consists precisely in its potential for coming into such relationships.

11:17.600 --> 11:24.640
In simply following through more fully on the implications hidden within Cartesian dualism,

11:24.640 --> 11:31.520
Bergson thus came to essentially turn inside out the Cartesian and Kantian formulations

11:31.520 --> 11:37.640
of the bifurcation of nature, such that mind and matter were now seen to be necessarily

11:37.640 --> 11:41.480
codependent and interpenetrating.

11:41.480 --> 11:47.440
After all, what else could matter possibly be other than experiences that have yet to

11:47.440 --> 11:50.800
become actualized?

11:50.800 --> 11:56.480
There are many implications which then unfold from re-synthesizing mind and matter in this

11:56.480 --> 11:57.560
way.

11:57.560 --> 12:03.800
In following Bergson we can see that subjectivity is in fact a fundamental aspect of reality

12:03.800 --> 12:12.320
itself, and that complex minds such as our own do not in fact have a monopoly on experience.

12:12.320 --> 12:18.840
And following through on the ontological implications of the nature of our own existence, we come

12:18.840 --> 12:26.400
to see that experience itself is in fact a fundamental aspect of the world itself.

12:26.400 --> 12:32.280
Bergson would then go on to formulate a very different sort of fundamental dichotomy, not

12:32.280 --> 12:38.400
between mind and matter, but rather between the mechanical and the organic.

12:38.400 --> 12:44.280
For Bergson, mechanical causation is that in which an event is determined entirely by

12:44.280 --> 12:50.720
preceding events, as in the case of falling dominoes or billiard balls bouncing off of

12:50.720 --> 12:52.280
one another.

12:52.280 --> 12:58.640
It is the realm of the mechanistic that science has striven to prioritize since its initial

12:58.640 --> 13:05.080
conception within Cartesian philosophy, but science often overextends itself in attempting

13:05.080 --> 13:12.240
to describe the organic aspects of reality, as though the organic were merely a more complex

13:12.240 --> 13:15.480
form of the mechanistic.

13:15.480 --> 13:21.280
Rather Bergson saw the organic as always being in a kind of dynamic relationship with the

13:21.280 --> 13:24.680
past or the future, or both.

13:24.680 --> 13:31.400
It is not only the immediately preceding moment which determines an organic behavior, but

13:31.400 --> 13:37.960
rather organic systems are able to draw from a kind of embodied memory, which extends much

13:37.960 --> 13:40.960
further into the past.

13:40.960 --> 13:47.000
Organic activity is therefore much more than the mechanistic sequence of immediately prior

13:47.000 --> 13:51.960
events determining immediately subsequent events.

13:51.960 --> 13:57.120
We see this concept illustrated by these cone-like diagrams, which Bergson employed

13:57.120 --> 13:59.280
within matter and memory.

13:59.280 --> 14:04.760
We can also see that these cones can stretch upward as well as downward, indicating that

14:04.760 --> 14:11.120
organisms are also capable of bringing possible futures into relation with the present in

14:11.120 --> 14:16.540
much the same way that they are able to bring the past into relation with the present.

14:16.540 --> 14:22.700
It would be this Bergsonian conception of organic memory, which would later inspire Rupert

14:22.700 --> 14:28.100
Sheldrake's development of Morphic Resonance Theory, which we explored in a previous series

14:28.100 --> 14:29.900
on this channel.

14:29.900 --> 14:34.780
Tufts University biologist Michael Levin has also employed very similar ideas and even

14:34.780 --> 14:40.460
very similar diagrammatic illustrations in his theoretical work regarding what he has

14:40.460 --> 14:44.500
dubbed cognitive light cones.

14:44.500 --> 14:49.660
What is most significant for our purposes here, however, is the manner in which Bergson's

14:49.660 --> 14:57.660
metaphysics collapses mind and matter back into one another in such a manner that experientiality

14:57.660 --> 15:02.500
is seen to be a fundamental aspect of nature itself.

15:02.500 --> 15:08.380
In correspondence to this fusion of mind and matter, there is also a correlative fissioning

15:08.380 --> 15:12.500
apart of the organic and the mechanistic.

15:12.500 --> 15:20.420
Rather than seeing organisms as squishy, complex machines, Bergson saw a very real divide between

15:20.420 --> 15:28.140
processes which were merely mechanistic and those which were genuinely alive, organic,

15:28.140 --> 15:29.140
or animate.

15:29.140 --> 15:35.020
But now I want us to turn our attention to a philosopher who would go even further than

15:35.020 --> 15:42.380
Bergson or any other thinker in his attempt to mend the Cartesian rupture between mind

15:42.380 --> 15:49.500
and matter and who would lay the groundwork for what is today an entire field of philosophy,

15:49.500 --> 15:54.980
now known often as process philosophy or process metaphysics.

15:54.980 --> 16:00.740
Here I am referring to the British mathematician and metaphysician Alfred North Whitehead,

16:00.740 --> 16:05.580
one of the single most titanic figures within the early development of what we now term

16:05.580 --> 16:12.660
analytic philosophy but who described his own philosophical system not as process philosophy

16:12.660 --> 16:19.620
nor as analytic philosophy but rather as a philosophy of organism.

16:19.620 --> 16:26.020
Whitehead himself was very closely interested and involved within the developments of physics

16:26.020 --> 16:30.260
which had begun to take shape in the early 20th century.

16:30.300 --> 16:36.780
This would culminate in what we now refer to as quantum electrodynamics or quantum field

16:36.780 --> 16:41.460
theory as well as the theory of general relativity.

16:41.460 --> 16:46.860
Both Henri Bergson and Whitehead would be very outspoken critics of what they saw as

16:46.860 --> 16:53.180
the implicit metaphysics of Einstein's general relativity and Whitehead himself would develop

16:53.180 --> 16:59.380
an alternative conception of gravity and relativity which he believed would avoid the pitfalls

16:59.420 --> 17:05.660
of Einstein's conception particularly the so-called black holes which Einstein himself

17:05.660 --> 17:11.980
believed to be a refutation of his own conception of relativity rather than a natural inference

17:11.980 --> 17:14.020
from it.

17:14.020 --> 17:19.940
But overall Whitehead was a thinker who perhaps more so than any other thinker of his own time

17:19.940 --> 17:24.740
or sense saw the writing on the walls very clearly.

17:24.740 --> 17:29.860
The metaphysical paradigm which had dominated science since the days of Descartes simply

17:29.860 --> 17:35.500
would not survive the developments in physics which were now being substantiated by precise

17:35.500 --> 17:39.780
measurements and experimental observations.

17:39.780 --> 17:46.580
The Enlightenment vision of the clockwork universe and clockmaker god were no longer

17:46.580 --> 17:51.060
adequate in accounting for the world which was coming to be revealed by the science which

17:51.060 --> 17:54.220
had stemmed from that vision.

17:54.220 --> 17:59.980
A new vision was needed as was a new conceptual framework and Whitehead would set himself

17:59.980 --> 18:04.660
the task of developing just such a conceptual system.

18:04.660 --> 18:10.820
In 1924 Whitehead would relocate to the United States where at Harvard University he would

18:10.820 --> 18:14.980
begin his philosophical project in earnest.

18:14.980 --> 18:20.260
In 1925 Whitehead would publish Science and the Modern World in which Whitehead would

18:20.260 --> 18:26.820
begin developing his critique of and alternative to Cartesian dualism.

18:26.820 --> 18:35.020
In 1927 Whitehead would present his more formalized ideas as a series of lectures which in 1929

18:35.020 --> 18:38.780
would be published as Process and Reality.

18:38.780 --> 18:44.060
A work which is now generally considered to be Whitehead's magnum opus and the most rigorous

18:44.060 --> 18:51.420
articulation of the metaphysical scheme which he had come to develop.

18:51.420 --> 18:56.260
Alright guys so I am not going to sugarcoat this, I am about to throw some very dense

18:56.260 --> 19:02.140
and nuanced terminology at you guys that will probably seem very alien and counterintuitive

19:02.140 --> 19:06.540
if you've never encountered Whitehead's ideas before so bear with me.

19:06.540 --> 19:12.380
There is a bit of jargon to unpack here but these ideas really are not that complicated.

19:12.380 --> 19:17.500
Because they seem difficult it's not because any of this is particularly arcane or bizarre

19:17.500 --> 19:24.820
rather it's because of how dramatically Whitehead's ideas stand in contrast to the implicit presumptions

19:24.820 --> 19:32.140
which remain the accepted doctrines of the post-Cartesian Modernist worldview.

19:32.140 --> 19:36.980
As previously mentioned Whitehead refers to the system developed in Process and Reality

19:36.980 --> 19:43.700
as a philosophy of organism and this nomenclature indicates that Whitehead had come to see the

19:43.700 --> 19:50.500
fundamental nature of the world as organic rather than consisting fundamentally of lifeless

19:50.500 --> 19:57.140
inert material as implied by the Cartesian paradigm which he sought to subvert.

19:57.140 --> 20:02.380
In Process and Reality Whitehead is attempting to rigorously describe a reality which he

20:02.380 --> 20:08.620
saw as inexorably alive even at the most basic level.

20:08.620 --> 20:14.540
Most central to Whitehead's system is a concept which he refers to as concrescence,

20:14.540 --> 20:20.780
a term which refers to what Whitehead saw as the fundamental nature of time.

20:20.780 --> 20:28.540
Concrescence implies a synthesis or coming together of actualities and potentialities

20:28.620 --> 20:35.340
which thereby come to concretize and thus form the basic units of the world

20:35.340 --> 20:47.260
which he variously termed actual occasions, actual entities or electromagnetic occasions of experience.

20:47.260 --> 20:53.340
As we also saw in Bergson's metaphysics we can see in Whitehead's scheme the implication that

20:53.340 --> 21:00.780
reality is characterized by both objectivity and subjectivity even at the most basic level.

21:00.780 --> 21:05.580
But moreover Whitehead is also indicating that the most basic elements of the world

21:05.580 --> 21:14.460
are events rather than enduring material objects. Rather than picturing nature as made up of tiny

21:14.460 --> 21:20.380
BBs bouncing around in the void, Whitehead was taking the implications of quantum physics

21:20.380 --> 21:27.420
seriously and thus concluding that the fundamental entities of the world are processes rather than

21:27.420 --> 21:35.260
material bodies. An actual event is formed by the process of concrescence and the nature of

21:35.260 --> 21:42.460
that process is determined by relationships which Whitehead calls prehensions. The word

21:42.460 --> 21:50.220
prehensions, similar to the word apprehension, etymologically implies grasping or taking up.

21:51.260 --> 21:58.460
Prehensions are the basic forms of interaction which give shape to actual events and allow for

21:58.460 --> 22:05.660
the achievement of determinacy from distributions or fields of indeterminacy.

22:06.540 --> 22:12.780
This concretization corresponds to what physicists would describe as wave function collapse.

22:13.820 --> 22:19.660
Whitehead describes three types of prehension, physical prehension, conceptual prehension,

22:19.660 --> 22:25.420
and hybrid prehension. These are the basic components of what Whitehead describes as a

22:25.420 --> 22:32.140
theory of feelings. I'm going to briefly describe the first two types of prehension here but the

22:32.140 --> 22:36.540
third type hybrid prehension is a bit more complicated and so that's something which we

22:36.540 --> 22:43.020
will be coming back to in later videos. Physical prehension consists in relationships between

22:43.020 --> 22:49.420
an organic process and actual occasions which have already occurred and which have thus already come

22:49.420 --> 22:57.740
to be concretized as determinate events within the past. Past actualities contribute themselves

22:57.820 --> 23:04.460
to a novel moment of creative genesis and this is the process which we commonly describe as

23:04.460 --> 23:13.100
physical causation or efficient teleology to use Aristotelian terms. In contrast to physical

23:13.100 --> 23:20.540
prehension we then have conceptual prehension. Conceptual prehension is the experience of

23:20.620 --> 23:28.700
possibilities rather than past actualities. It is the feeling of real potentialities which are

23:28.700 --> 23:36.940
available to a given concrescence, a given moment of experience. Whitehead describes these potentialities

23:36.940 --> 23:44.780
as eternal objects which are essentially equivalent to platonic forms. They are the basic structures

23:44.780 --> 23:52.940
or patterns which an event can incorporate into itself so as to thereby achieve concrete determinacy.

23:53.660 --> 23:59.980
An occasion of concrescence is fundamentally an experiential decision in which the event

24:00.540 --> 24:07.420
actively selects which possibilities come to give shape to it as it then concretizes

24:07.420 --> 24:14.540
and then becomes a definite feature of the past. So let's now try to make sense of all that by

24:14.540 --> 24:20.300
actually looking at how this scheme might map on to the basic features of our world.

24:21.100 --> 24:27.180
Quantum mechanics describes the world as consisting fundamentally of fields and particles.

24:27.980 --> 24:33.900
The word particle however is already itself something of an issue as the word particle

24:33.900 --> 24:39.500
is something that we intuitively take to refer to a material body of some sort,

24:39.500 --> 24:46.700
a physically enduring BB of some sort. As previously indicated, Whitehead's scheme is one

24:46.700 --> 24:54.620
in which the basic elements are events rather than material bodies. You can find this conceptual

24:54.620 --> 25:00.700
convolution present in almost any discussions pertaining to quantum mechanics. Physicists

25:00.700 --> 25:06.940
speak of quantum particles as though they are physical bodies and with the next breath tell us

25:06.940 --> 25:14.140
that these particles can be distributed throughout space, that they can be in various locations

25:14.140 --> 25:20.860
at the same time. Particles are also described as point-like meaning that they are said to have

25:20.860 --> 25:27.500
no physical extension in space even though they are also implied to be physical bodies

25:27.500 --> 25:33.420
which have properties such as mass. Seen through Whitehead's conceptual scheme however,

25:33.420 --> 25:40.460
what we instead find are distributions of real potentiality and fully determinate events.

25:41.340 --> 25:47.900
For example, physicists will often describe the electron orbital shell of an atom as a

25:47.900 --> 25:55.980
distribution of probability which radiates outward from the atomic nucleus. There is a material or

25:55.980 --> 26:03.900
at least quasi-material body which we call the electron particle, but the so-called particle

26:03.900 --> 26:10.380
exists throughout this distributional aura until a particular interaction event occurs,

26:10.380 --> 26:16.460
at which point the electron will indeed come to be at a particular location in space,

26:16.460 --> 26:22.780
at least for that particular moment. With in Whitehead's scheme however, there simply are no

26:22.780 --> 26:30.620
material or quasi-material bodies which underlie such quantum phenomena. There are fields which

26:30.620 --> 26:37.900
are distributions of possible events and then there are the actual events themselves, the

26:37.900 --> 26:46.940
electromagnetic occasions of experience. These events are experiential, decisive and essentially

26:46.940 --> 26:55.260
organic processes which can come to loop back upon themselves so as to form recurrent cyclical

26:55.260 --> 27:02.860
oscillatory patterns, knots of electromagnetic process as it were, which when sufficiently

27:02.860 --> 27:09.420
rigidified begin to behave in a manner analogous to what we would expect from enduring physical

27:09.420 --> 27:17.020
bodies. The electronic field which surrounds the atom is thus not a particle which is in

27:17.020 --> 27:24.300
numerous places all at once, but rather it is a range of possible locations in which electromagnetic

27:24.300 --> 27:32.220
events could possibly occur. These events then condition the structure of future possibilities

27:32.220 --> 27:38.220
and thus condition the nature of subsequent events, but this efficient determination is

27:38.220 --> 27:45.020
never complete. The electromagnetic occasions of experience always have options and this is the

27:45.020 --> 27:52.220
nature of the fundamental indeterminacy which we find in quantum electrodynamics. Within the

27:52.220 --> 27:58.940
philosophy of organism, the basic structure of human experience is also the basic structure of the

27:58.940 --> 28:07.500
world itself. We are living beings and reality itself shares in this character with us. There is

28:07.580 --> 28:14.220
no introversible gulf between the nature of our own existence and the nature of the world.

28:14.860 --> 28:23.500
To be a subject within an objective reality is simply to be a participant within the ongoing

28:23.500 --> 28:30.940
creative advance of the cosmos which we are a part of. As Whitehead states in Science in the

28:30.940 --> 28:39.340
Modern World, quote, biology is the study of the larger organisms, whereas physics is the study

28:39.340 --> 28:47.260
of the smaller organisms, end quote. Quantum events are the most basic organic processes which

28:47.260 --> 28:55.660
constitute the world and atoms are the most basic organisms, the most basic self-referential knots

28:55.660 --> 29:02.620
comprised of such organic events. For Whitehead, nature is organic in the sense that it is

29:02.620 --> 29:11.020
fundamentally experiential, but also in that it is fundamentally self-creative. It is characterized by

29:11.020 --> 29:20.540
what the biologist Francisco Varela would call autopoiesis. For Whitehead, time itself is a creative

29:20.540 --> 29:28.380
advance through which nature continually strives towards the actualization of ever more complex

29:28.380 --> 29:37.580
and synergistic novelty. Mere mechanistic causation is the exception, not the rule, within such a

29:37.580 --> 29:46.220
universe. Organic processes strive to sustain and perpetuate themselves, and in doing so come to

29:47.020 --> 29:55.180
symbiotic relationships with one another, thereby giving rise to ever more complex organisms

29:55.180 --> 30:02.860
with ever more richly nuanced experiences. Whitehead's paradigm is one in which biological

30:02.860 --> 30:11.100
organisms are but one particular branch of a tree of life which includes atoms as well as stars,

30:11.180 --> 30:19.500
planetary systems, and galaxies. At all levels what we find are self-organizing and self-creative

30:19.500 --> 30:27.100
electromagnetic systems which come to synchronize the diversity of nature into complex living

30:27.100 --> 30:33.980
unities. Now that all might sound like a bunch of poetic gobbledygook if you're new to these

30:33.980 --> 30:39.980
ideas and I'm gonna abstain from making this video two hours long by unpacking them even further,

30:39.980 --> 30:45.500
for now at least. However, if you want to see these principles in action, then I'd recommend

30:45.500 --> 30:51.100
checking out my video series on Rupert Sheldrake's theory of morphic resonance, in which I also talk

30:51.100 --> 30:57.180
a bit about Michael Levin's research regarding bioelectricity. Both Sheldrake and Levin are

30:57.180 --> 31:03.900
contemporary standard bearers for this more organismic conception of the world. I would also

31:03.900 --> 31:09.660
recommend checking out some of the ideas developed by adherents of the Electric Universe model of

31:09.660 --> 31:18.220
cosmology which has been an attempt to understand astrophysical phenomena in terms of electro-organic

31:18.220 --> 31:24.380
self-organization. As data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope continues to make it

31:24.380 --> 31:33.260
increasingly undeniable that our current mechanistic cosmology is in an inescapable crisis. I think it

31:33.260 --> 31:39.660
is now more important than ever that we take very seriously the thinkers who saw in advance the

31:39.660 --> 31:45.980
problems which are intrinsic to the underlying presumptions of modern science. Bergson and

31:45.980 --> 31:53.580
Whitehead being only two of many such figures. Within an organismic rather than mechanistic

31:53.580 --> 32:01.260
paradigm, we avoid the intractable problems of somehow deriving consciousness from inanimate

32:01.260 --> 32:08.300
matter. As we can see that the world simply is not comprised of inanimate matter, but rather of

32:08.300 --> 32:15.180
animate processes which are themselves already experiential in character. Consciousness and

32:15.180 --> 32:22.540
existence are intertwined from their very foundations. We can see that we don't need to wait for some

32:22.540 --> 32:29.980
arcane mathematical models in order to understand consciousness scientifically. Seen correctly,

32:30.060 --> 32:36.060
disciplines such as biology and physics already are the study of consciousness.

32:36.940 --> 32:42.380
I'll be leaving it at that for now, however, so thanks for watching and have a great week. I'll see

32:42.380 --> 32:46.780
you in the next video.
