00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
This guy, Gottlob Frege, published this paper

00:03.280 --> 00:08.240
Ã¼ber Sinn und Bedeutung on Sense and Reference in 1892.

00:08.240 --> 00:12.640
And it is the most important paper in the history of the philosophy of language.

00:12.640 --> 00:17.360
It is very complicated, but I'm going to explain it now.

00:19.200 --> 00:24.160
Frege realizes that linguistic terms, words, have to have two levels of meaning.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.720
They each have to have a sense and a reference.

00:26.720 --> 00:28.960
I'm going to explain exactly what those are,

00:28.960 --> 00:33.520
but first we need to see the puzzle that forces Frege into this position.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.360
To illustrate this puzzle, I'm going to have you watch like a viral video.

00:56.720 --> 01:14.320
Okay, that was fun.

01:14.320 --> 01:18.320
The noteworthy thing about this interaction is that the woman, her name is Ellen,

01:19.120 --> 01:23.520
she already knows the meaning of the name Jay-Z.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.160
So it's not like what happens is that the guy tells her,

01:26.160 --> 01:30.400
oh, there's this name Jay-Z and the name refers to me.

01:30.400 --> 01:31.040
It's my name.

01:31.040 --> 01:31.920
That's not what happens.

01:31.920 --> 01:33.760
No, no, she's familiar with the name.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.280
She knows the meaning of Jay-Z,

01:35.920 --> 01:40.480
but she still learns something at the end of the video

01:40.480 --> 01:42.560
when he tells her that he is Jay-Z.

01:44.160 --> 01:46.000
So there's like two possibilities.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.200
She could learn something linguistic about the name,

01:49.200 --> 01:51.520
or she could learn something empirical.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.920
Empirical just means knowable by observation or experience.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.240
Another term for this is a posteriori.

01:58.240 --> 02:01.520
And the point of this story is just that what this woman learns

02:01.520 --> 02:05.120
at the end of the conversation is not linguistic.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.160
She's not learning anything about the meaning of the name Jay-Z.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.360
She already knew that name.

02:09.920 --> 02:13.520
She's learning an empirical fact, a fact about the world,

02:13.520 --> 02:17.440
which is, oh, this guy that I've been sitting next to, he is Jay-Z.

02:18.240 --> 02:21.680
Consider these two sentences.

02:21.680 --> 02:27.040
Sean Carter is Sean Carter and Sean Carter is Jay-Z.

02:27.040 --> 02:31.600
That's Jay-Z's government name, his regular name.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.040
Sean Carter, that's his name.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.240
Sentences of this type are called identity statements

02:36.240 --> 02:39.120
because they say that two things are one thing.

02:39.120 --> 02:40.160
Two things are identical.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.520
They're the very same thing.

02:41.520 --> 02:45.680
Imagine in the case of Ellen and Jay-Z on the subway,

02:45.680 --> 02:48.320
imagine that she knew him by the name Sean Carter.

02:48.320 --> 02:49.920
Like maybe he got on the train

02:49.920 --> 02:52.320
and they introduced themselves to each other

02:52.320 --> 02:54.720
and he introduced himself as Sean Carter.

02:54.720 --> 02:55.600
That's his name.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.200
She knows who Sean Carter is

02:58.000 --> 03:00.880
and she also knows that there's this musician,

03:00.880 --> 03:02.560
this rapper named Jay-Z.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.000
Maybe she's seen pictures of him.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.280
She knows who Jay-Z is.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.160
But she hasn't yet put it together in her mind

03:08.160 --> 03:12.160
that this guy right next to her, Sean Carter, is Jay-Z.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.520
If that's the case,

03:13.520 --> 03:18.160
then sentence number two can be informative to her.

03:18.160 --> 03:21.360
It has, as Frege says, cognitive value.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.240
You can really learn something from sentence number two.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.720
This woman, Ellen, can really learn something

03:27.520 --> 03:31.040
by discovering or being told that Sean Carter is Jay-Z.

03:32.160 --> 03:35.120
So I'm writing here that sentence two is informative.

03:35.120 --> 03:38.320
It can teach her something in the way that sentence one never could.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.840
Sean Carter is Sean Carter.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.200
Yes, of course.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.840
As long as these two names, here and here,

03:43.840 --> 03:46.720
are being used in the same sense to mean the same thing,

03:46.720 --> 03:49.440
well then one is totally banal and uninformative,

03:49.440 --> 03:52.000
whereas two can be informative.

03:53.120 --> 03:55.840
But sentence two can also be empirical

03:55.840 --> 03:58.800
in the sense that the information that you get from sentence two

03:58.800 --> 04:02.240
can be, in some cases, not about language,

04:02.240 --> 04:03.920
not about the meanings of the words,

04:03.920 --> 04:06.160
but it can be something that has to be discovered

04:06.160 --> 04:08.640
through going out into the world and existing

04:08.720 --> 04:10.480
and discovering things like, namely,

04:10.480 --> 04:13.280
oh, this guy sitting next to me, he's a famous rapper.

04:13.280 --> 04:14.800
That's the point of this example.

04:14.800 --> 04:16.640
In the middle of the train ride,

04:16.640 --> 04:19.440
Ellen knows all the linguistic facts.

04:19.440 --> 04:23.040
She knows what this name, Sean Carter, means.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.560
She knows who it refers to.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.240
It refers to this guy sitting next to me.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.520
She also is familiar with and understands the name Jay-Z.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.840
She knows, oh, that's the name for this famous musician.

04:31.840 --> 04:34.320
Maybe she can name a whole bunch of facts about Jay-Z.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.320
She can know all the linguistic facts,

04:36.320 --> 04:39.200
but still there's that moment at the end of the train ride

04:39.200 --> 04:42.000
where she learns something like sentence two.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.960
She learns that this guy, Sean Carter, is Jay-Z.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.920
And so what she learns can't be linguistic

04:47.920 --> 04:49.680
because she already knew the linguistic stuff.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.200
It has to be some empirical fact about the real world,

04:53.200 --> 04:55.760
some observable experiential fact.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.360
Now we're ready to state the puzzle.

04:57.360 --> 05:01.280
How can we have a theory of language, a theory of names,

05:01.280 --> 05:04.640
that explains these two features of sentence number two,

05:04.640 --> 05:06.480
that it can be informative,

05:06.480 --> 05:08.720
and then more specifically, the kind of information

05:08.720 --> 05:12.240
that it can give can be empirical information.

05:12.240 --> 05:16.640
The reason this is a puzzle is that there was this other theory

05:16.640 --> 05:20.720
of names published in 1881 by John Stuart Mill

05:20.720 --> 05:22.480
and according to Mill's theory,

05:22.480 --> 05:26.480
the meaning of a proper name like Sean Carter or Jay-Z,

05:26.480 --> 05:28.880
the meaning of a name like that is nothing more

05:28.880 --> 05:30.320
than the object named.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.560
And Mill's theory sounds really good

05:32.560 --> 05:35.280
when you read that paper that he published in 1881,

05:35.280 --> 05:37.280
but then you run into cases like this

05:37.280 --> 05:38.480
and he can't handle this.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.480
According to Mill, the name Sean Carter

05:40.480 --> 05:43.600
and the name Jay-Z mean exactly the same thing.

05:43.600 --> 05:46.240
And so sentence one and sentence two are no different.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.360
Mill is unable to explain why a sentence like two

05:49.360 --> 05:52.160
can be genuinely illuminating, informative,

05:52.160 --> 05:54.240
why it can have some cognitive value

05:54.240 --> 05:56.000
in a way that a sentence like one doesn't.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.320
Because after all, on Mill's theory,

05:58.320 --> 06:01.520
the meaning of these letters right here is just the dude

06:01.600 --> 06:03.280
and the meaning of these letters right here

06:03.280 --> 06:04.480
is the exact same dude.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.680
So it's just this dude is this dude.

06:07.680 --> 06:11.360
Yeah, duh, just like in this case, this dude is this dude.

06:11.360 --> 06:12.320
There's no difference.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.720
Now there's an alternative to Mill's theory

06:14.720 --> 06:17.600
that can explain how sentence two

06:17.600 --> 06:20.400
can be illuminating, informative,

06:20.400 --> 06:22.160
in a way that sentence one can't.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.680
And that theory translates sentence two

06:25.680 --> 06:28.880
as a sentence about language itself.

06:29.760 --> 06:34.000
On this theory, sentence two is really just shorthand

06:34.000 --> 06:36.240
for something like sentence two star.

06:36.240 --> 06:41.120
The name Sean Carter and the name Jay-Z denote the same person.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.560
If this is what two means,

06:42.560 --> 06:45.840
then it makes sense why two is informative

06:45.840 --> 06:47.200
in a way that one isn't.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.440
One would be translated correspondingly

06:49.440 --> 06:51.360
as something like the name Sean Carter

06:51.360 --> 06:54.320
and the name Sean Carter denote the same person.

06:54.320 --> 06:55.280
That's obvious.

06:55.280 --> 06:56.560
But this is not obvious.

06:56.560 --> 06:59.040
Like this is a fact that you might not know.

06:59.040 --> 07:03.120
And this theory that translates identity statements like this

07:03.120 --> 07:05.600
into sort of linguistic statements like this,

07:05.600 --> 07:08.560
that theory is actually Fraga's old theory

07:08.560 --> 07:12.080
from the Begriff Schrift, which he published in 1879.

07:12.080 --> 07:17.840
But 13 years went by between 1879 and 1892

07:17.840 --> 07:19.760
when he published On Sense and Reference.

07:19.760 --> 07:23.520
And during those 13 years, Fraga realized that this theory,

07:23.520 --> 07:25.600
the theory that translates identity statements

07:25.600 --> 07:27.760
into linguistic statements like this,

07:27.760 --> 07:29.360
that theory wasn't good.

07:29.360 --> 07:32.960
And the reason is that statements like number two here

07:32.960 --> 07:35.360
can be informative, not just informative,

07:35.360 --> 07:37.040
but empirically informative.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.080
The idea is simply that when Ellen had this moment

07:40.080 --> 07:41.680
of realization on the subway,

07:41.680 --> 07:44.560
she wasn't realizing something about the meanings

07:44.560 --> 07:47.040
of these terms, she was realizing something

07:47.040 --> 07:48.320
about the world around her.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.280
And Fraga gets this.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.920
He understands all this stuff about Ellen and Jay-Z.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.320
And so what he does in On Sense and Reference

07:54.400 --> 07:56.640
is he tosses out his old theory

07:56.640 --> 07:59.200
and he gives a new theory of sentences like that.

07:59.200 --> 08:02.640
And it turns out to be not just a theory of identity statements

08:02.640 --> 08:04.640
like this, but of all of language.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.240
Very quickly, I'm going to illustrate this again

08:08.240 --> 08:09.760
with Fraga's own example,

08:09.760 --> 08:13.040
which involves the morning star and the evening star.

08:13.040 --> 08:13.680
To understand this,

08:13.680 --> 08:16.880
you're going to need some astronomical background information.

08:16.880 --> 08:17.760
So here it is.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.440
If you look at the sunrise, just before sunrise,

08:21.440 --> 08:24.480
right near where the sun is about to rise,

08:24.480 --> 08:26.960
you can see a very bright star, sometimes.

08:26.960 --> 08:29.520
And the name of that star is the morning star.

08:29.520 --> 08:32.480
And then also just after sunset,

08:32.480 --> 08:35.200
right near where the sun just set,

08:35.200 --> 08:38.160
sometimes you can see this other bright star

08:38.160 --> 08:40.720
and that star is called the evening star.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.960
Okay, those are stars and people have known

08:42.960 --> 08:44.480
about these stars for a long time

08:44.480 --> 08:46.960
and they name the stars because we name things.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.280
But then at some point, someone discovered

08:49.280 --> 08:52.320
that these two stars were the exact same thing.

08:52.320 --> 08:53.840
And they're not even stars.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.240
It turns out they are the planet Venus.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.840
So what you've got are sort of trivial sentences

08:59.840 --> 09:02.480
like the morning star is the morning star.

09:02.480 --> 09:03.600
Yeah, duh.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.720
And then you've got possibly very informative,

09:06.720 --> 09:10.640
noteworthy sentences like the morning star is the evening star.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.120
So just like in the case of this sentence too,

09:13.120 --> 09:14.960
this sentence too can be informative.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.600
And the kind of information that this sentence carries

09:17.680 --> 09:19.680
is not linguistic information,

09:19.680 --> 09:23.280
but empirical astronomical information.

09:23.280 --> 09:24.560
Someone can be in a situation

09:24.560 --> 09:26.480
where they know the meaning of this name

09:26.480 --> 09:28.480
or this phrase or whatever the morning star.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.520
They know which star it is.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.480
They can even point to it.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.400
They can even say that one's the morning star.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.600
That's the object denoted by the name

09:35.600 --> 09:37.920
or the description, the morning star.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.920
And they can do the same thing, let's suppose,

09:39.920 --> 09:40.880
for the evening star.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.080
They know what this phrase means

09:42.080 --> 09:42.960
and they can point to it.

09:42.960 --> 09:46.160
So they know what is denoted by all of these terms,

09:46.240 --> 09:47.680
but what they don't know

09:47.680 --> 09:50.640
is that these two objects are one object.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.240
And so when you tell someone

09:52.240 --> 09:54.560
the morning star is the evening star,

09:54.560 --> 09:56.240
you can be telling them something

09:56.240 --> 09:57.680
that they didn't know already

09:57.680 --> 09:59.600
and not something linguistic at all.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.520
And Mill's theory of names

10:01.520 --> 10:03.600
and Frago's old theory of names

10:03.600 --> 10:06.240
that translates identity statements

10:06.240 --> 10:08.800
into these linguistic statements or whatever,

10:08.800 --> 10:10.240
neither of those theories

10:10.240 --> 10:14.640
can explain these facts about this sentence and this sentence.

10:14.640 --> 10:15.760
That they are informative

10:15.760 --> 10:18.080
and that the kind of information that they can give

10:18.080 --> 10:20.000
is often empirical.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.680
Okay, so that's the puzzle.

10:21.680 --> 10:22.560
That's the problem.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.000
And what Frago does

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
is he solves this problem

10:26.000 --> 10:29.440
by introducing an additional layer of meaning.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.080
And that sort of additional middle layer

10:32.080 --> 10:34.880
of the meaning of a term is the sense.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.000
It is natural now

10:36.000 --> 10:38.320
to think of their being connected with a sign,

10:38.320 --> 10:40.400
a name, combination of words, letter,

10:40.400 --> 10:42.800
besides that to which the sign refers,

10:42.800 --> 10:44.560
which may be called the referent of the sign.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.680
Also, what I would like to call the sense of the sign,

10:47.680 --> 10:50.720
wherein the mode of presentation is contained.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.440
Okay, so Frago is talking about three different things.

10:55.040 --> 10:57.760
The first thing is the name or the sign.

10:58.800 --> 10:59.760
And then of course,

10:59.760 --> 11:02.480
there's the thing that the name picks out

11:02.480 --> 11:04.480
or refers to the referent,

11:04.480 --> 11:07.120
which in this case, the referent is the guy,

11:07.120 --> 11:08.560
the actual person, Jay-Z.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.360
But in addition to the referent,

11:11.360 --> 11:13.680
Frago is saying that there's this other

11:13.760 --> 11:15.440
middle level of meaning,

11:15.440 --> 11:16.880
which he calls the sense.

11:18.880 --> 11:21.680
And it's really not clear at this point in the paper

11:21.680 --> 11:24.960
what the sense of a name or of any expression is,

11:24.960 --> 11:27.680
but it has something to do with a mode of presentation.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.280
So I have to explain what that is.

11:29.280 --> 11:31.920
Are you familiar with the concept of a McMansion?

11:31.920 --> 11:34.480
That's like a poorly constructed ugly home

11:34.480 --> 11:36.320
with too many roof lines or whatever.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.400
Imagine one of these ugly houses.

11:38.400 --> 11:39.760
And in the front of the house,

11:39.760 --> 11:43.600
there's like fancy stonework or bricks or columns

11:43.680 --> 11:44.560
or something like that.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.680
But in the back of the house, it's just plastic siding.

11:47.680 --> 11:48.800
So you can imagine a case

11:48.800 --> 11:50.960
where you've seen this house from the front.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.520
That's one way of viewing the house,

11:53.520 --> 11:56.720
one literal angle or perspective

11:56.720 --> 11:58.320
from which you can view the house.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.400
You might also see the house from the back.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.320
That's a different perspective,

12:02.320 --> 12:04.880
a different mode of presentation of the house,

12:04.880 --> 12:07.760
a different way that the house could be presented to you.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.880
And you can know the house in both of these ways

12:10.880 --> 12:13.200
without actually knowing that they're the same house.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.600
And then it might be informative to you to find out,

12:15.600 --> 12:17.840
oh, look at that, that's the same one house.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.280
That's what Frege is getting at

12:19.280 --> 12:21.120
with this idea of a mode of presentation.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.880
There are two different ways of knowing Sean Carter.

12:24.880 --> 12:29.600
You could know him as the kid from Brooklyn or whatever.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.800
Or you could know him as Jay-Z, the mogul,

12:32.800 --> 12:35.120
the billionaire rapper or whatever.

12:35.120 --> 12:36.320
I don't know if he has a billion dollars,

12:36.320 --> 12:40.000
but close to a billion or a little more, I think.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.880
The simplest way, although this is a little contentious,

12:42.880 --> 12:46.240
to think of the sense or mode of presentation

12:46.240 --> 12:49.840
of a name or phrase is to think of it as a description.

12:49.840 --> 12:55.840
You could describe this guy as a billionaire music mogul

12:55.840 --> 12:59.520
or you could describe him as a middle-aged man

12:59.520 --> 13:00.960
who was born in Brooklyn

13:00.960 --> 13:03.760
and still lives most of the time in the greater New York area.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.880
Those are two different ways of presenting

13:06.880 --> 13:11.280
or characterizing this guy, Sean Carter or Jay-Z.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.040
Frege's point is this.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.400
A name, or for that matter, any other linguistic term,

13:17.120 --> 13:20.640
a name has not only this level of meaning,

13:20.640 --> 13:22.800
which is the object named,

13:22.800 --> 13:26.720
but also the way that that object is characterized

13:26.720 --> 13:30.560
or presented by the sign, by the name.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.640
Frege himself actually explains this,

13:32.640 --> 13:35.520
though with a somewhat abstract mathematical example

13:35.520 --> 13:38.640
that might not have been obvious from just reading the text.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.440
So I'm going to read it and then explain exactly what he means.

13:41.440 --> 13:45.680
Let ABC be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle

13:45.680 --> 13:47.760
with the midpoints of the opposite sides.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.760
Okay, so there's no actual diagram in the published paper,

13:51.760 --> 13:54.320
but I created this diagram.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.880
You see that inside of this triangle, there are three lines.

13:56.880 --> 13:59.360
There's the vertical line, which is called A,

13:59.360 --> 14:02.080
and then there's this other line, that's line B,

14:02.080 --> 14:04.400
and then line C is the third line

14:04.400 --> 14:06.080
going from the lower right to the upper left.

14:06.080 --> 14:07.520
And the important thing to notice

14:07.520 --> 14:09.840
is that all three of these lines intersect,

14:09.840 --> 14:13.360
they cross each other or meet at the very same point in the middle.

14:13.360 --> 14:15.840
The point of intersection of A and B

14:15.840 --> 14:19.280
is then the same as the point of intersection of B and C.

14:19.280 --> 14:22.400
So there's just one point here in the middle of this diagram,

14:22.400 --> 14:25.040
but Frege mentions at least two different ways

14:25.040 --> 14:27.040
of describing that exact same point,

14:27.040 --> 14:30.000
the place where lines A and B intersect,

14:30.000 --> 14:32.160
or you could describe the very same point

14:32.160 --> 14:35.200
as the place where lines B and C intersect.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.040
So we have different designations

14:37.040 --> 14:38.240
for the same point.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.040
And these names, point of intersection of A and B,

14:41.040 --> 14:42.960
point of intersection of B and C,

14:42.960 --> 14:45.840
likewise indicate the mode of presentation.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.240
So these two different names for the one point,

14:48.240 --> 14:50.960
the point of intersection of A and B,

14:50.960 --> 14:53.520
and the point of intersection of C and D,

14:53.520 --> 14:55.760
these two names, they pick out the same point,

14:55.760 --> 14:59.120
but they present that point in different ways.

14:59.120 --> 15:02.320
They involve different modes of presentation

15:02.320 --> 15:03.680
of that same point.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.480
And hence, the statement contains true knowledge.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.160
What he means by that is just that

15:08.160 --> 15:11.840
because these two different names for that one point

15:11.840 --> 15:14.400
have different modes of presentation,

15:14.400 --> 15:16.720
that sentence, the sentence that

15:16.720 --> 15:19.280
the point of intersection of A and B

15:19.280 --> 15:22.560
is the same as the point of intersection of B and C,

15:22.560 --> 15:25.360
that sentence, like sentence two here,

15:25.360 --> 15:28.400
can contain real genuine information,

15:28.400 --> 15:30.320
true knowledge, as Frege calls it.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.080
In our example, accordingly,

15:32.080 --> 15:33.760
the reference of the expressions

15:33.760 --> 15:35.600
the point of intersection of A and B

15:35.600 --> 15:37.840
and the point of intersection of B and C

15:37.840 --> 15:40.320
would be the same, but not their senses.

15:40.320 --> 15:44.320
Right, so these two names have the same referent,

15:44.320 --> 15:46.240
but different senses,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.480
different ways of presenting that referent.

15:48.480 --> 15:51.360
That's exactly what's going on with Sean Carter and Jay-Z.

15:51.360 --> 15:55.040
These two names, they refer to the same guy,

15:55.040 --> 15:56.480
they have the same referent,

15:56.480 --> 15:58.320
but they have different senses.

15:58.320 --> 16:00.880
They present him in different ways.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.800
And it's the same way with the example

16:02.800 --> 16:04.800
of the morning star and the evening star.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.360
The referent of evening star would be the same

16:07.360 --> 16:09.840
as that of morning star, but not the sense.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.520
So those two names, the morning star and the evening star,

16:13.520 --> 16:15.280
they have the same referent,

16:15.280 --> 16:16.640
which happens to be Venus,

16:16.640 --> 16:19.360
but they present that referent differently.

16:19.360 --> 16:23.600
They make reference to Venus via different senses.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.240
And this theory, this theory that says

16:26.240 --> 16:28.480
that for all the linguistic signs,

16:28.480 --> 16:30.400
there are two levels of meaning,

16:30.400 --> 16:32.640
the level of sense and the level of reference.

16:32.720 --> 16:36.160
This theory can explain both of these facts

16:36.160 --> 16:38.320
about identity statements like two.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.200
It can explain why these sentences are informative

16:41.200 --> 16:43.280
and it can explain why that information

16:43.280 --> 16:45.520
can be non-linguistic and empirical.

16:45.520 --> 16:47.200
It's possible for one to already know

16:47.200 --> 16:49.360
the linguistic information.

16:49.360 --> 16:53.040
One knows the sense of Sean Carter, the meaning.

16:53.040 --> 16:57.360
And one knows the sense of the term or name Jay-Z.

16:57.360 --> 17:00.080
But then one can find out, oh!

17:00.080 --> 17:01.040
Oh!

17:01.040 --> 17:04.080
These two terms that I already know the meaning to,

17:04.080 --> 17:06.320
they refer to the very same guy.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.320
That is how Frege solves the puzzle.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.560
Oh, but there's more, there's like way more.

17:10.560 --> 17:13.280
The regular connection between a sign, its sense

17:13.280 --> 17:15.200
and its referent is of such a kind

17:15.200 --> 17:18.080
that to the sign, there corresponds a definite sense

17:18.080 --> 17:20.560
and to that, in turn, a definite referent.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.880
The point Frege is making there is just that

17:22.880 --> 17:27.200
in the normal case, for one name, there is one sense

17:27.200 --> 17:30.000
and then one referent, one to one to one.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.560
While to a given referent, an object,

17:32.560 --> 17:35.040
there does not belong only a single sign.

17:35.040 --> 17:38.480
But if instead we start with the object, the referent,

17:38.480 --> 17:41.600
there might be more than one name for that object, right?

17:41.600 --> 17:44.640
There might be Jay-Z and Sean Carter and Hove.

17:45.200 --> 17:46.480
That's another one, I think.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.720
The same sense has different expressions

17:48.720 --> 17:51.280
in different languages or even in the same language.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.880
Okay, this is an additional point,

17:52.880 --> 17:55.920
but Frege thinks that the same sense

17:55.920 --> 17:58.480
can be the meaning of different terms.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.600
It might be, I'm sort of playing a little fast

18:01.600 --> 18:05.200
and loose here, but it might be that Jay-Z

18:05.200 --> 18:08.640
and Hove, H-O-V, I'm pretty sure that's how it's spelled,

18:08.640 --> 18:10.240
those are two different names,

18:10.240 --> 18:12.560
but maybe they present him in the same way.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.600
So they have the same sense, two different names,

18:15.600 --> 18:17.120
same sense, same referent.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.120
That's also possible, Frege thinks.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.680
And then there's the case of what are today

18:21.680 --> 18:23.520
commonly called empty names.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.400
These are names that are meaningful,

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
but they don't refer to anything.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.960
It may perhaps be granted that every grammatically

18:30.960 --> 18:33.920
well-formed expression representing a proper name

18:33.920 --> 18:35.520
always has a sense.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.400
This just means that if a name is meaningful,

18:38.400 --> 18:39.520
it has a sense.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.920
But this is not to say that to the sense,

18:41.920 --> 18:43.840
there also corresponds a referent.

18:43.840 --> 18:47.200
But just because a name is meaningful and has a sense

18:47.200 --> 18:49.920
doesn't mean that there really is an object in the world

18:49.920 --> 18:52.480
that is referred to by that name.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.280
Frege is going to give us an example right now.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.720
The words, the celestial body most distant from the earth

18:58.720 --> 19:00.640
have a sense, but it is very doubtful

19:00.640 --> 19:02.080
if they also have a referent.

19:02.080 --> 19:05.840
The phrase, the celestial body most distant from the earth,

19:05.840 --> 19:08.000
that's a perfectly meaningful label,

19:08.000 --> 19:10.400
it's a definite description, it has a meaning.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.480
Frege just thinks, and I think he's probably right,

19:12.480 --> 19:16.240
that there is no object in space that is the one object

19:16.240 --> 19:18.080
that is the farthest away from the earth.

19:18.080 --> 19:21.360
Maybe because like space curves or I don't know,

19:21.360 --> 19:24.000
but there might not be a thing out in the world

19:24.000 --> 19:25.280
that's referred to in that way,

19:25.280 --> 19:28.000
but nonetheless, the name can be meaningful.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.560
Here's another thing that's very important to Frege.

19:30.560 --> 19:35.120
It's important that the sense of a term is public.

19:35.120 --> 19:38.480
Different people can mean the same thing by a term,

19:38.480 --> 19:40.400
and so they have to be able to share the sense.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.440
And for that reason, the sense of a term,

19:43.440 --> 19:46.000
the mode of presentation contained in the name,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.840
blah, blah, blah, all of that,

19:47.840 --> 19:52.000
that's not the same as some private mental thing,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.640
some conception or image in your mind.

19:54.640 --> 19:58.160
It can't be that because that thing in your mind is private.

19:58.160 --> 20:02.240
No one else can see your conception can have it.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.040
And so whatever private stuff is going on in there,

20:05.040 --> 20:07.840
that can't be what Frege means by sense.

20:07.840 --> 20:09.840
The referent and sense of a sign

20:09.840 --> 20:12.960
are to be distinguished from the associated conception.

20:17.120 --> 20:21.760
The associated conception is whatever shows up in someone's mind

20:21.760 --> 20:24.640
when they hear this name, and Frege is saying,

20:24.640 --> 20:27.440
that is not the sense, and that's not the referent,

20:27.440 --> 20:28.880
that's some other thing.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.120
This constitutes an essential distinction

20:31.120 --> 20:33.520
between the conception and the sign's sense,

20:33.520 --> 20:35.440
which may be the common property of many,

20:35.440 --> 20:39.280
and therefore is not part or a mode of the individual mind.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.640
Frege's point there is simply

20:40.640 --> 20:43.840
that the sense of a term is common property.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.680
It's something that multiple people can share.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.600
And you can see why Frege thinks this.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.880
The sense is the meaning of the name,

20:50.960 --> 20:54.000
and he wants two different people to mean the exact same thing.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.640
If the meaning of a name was some private thing

20:56.640 --> 20:58.080
inside your own mind,

20:58.080 --> 21:00.320
then you could never mean the exact same thing

21:00.320 --> 21:02.160
by a term as someone else.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.880
This wasn't in the part of this paper that I've assigned,

21:04.880 --> 21:09.280
but Frege also thinks that the sense of a name or a term

21:09.280 --> 21:10.720
determines the referent.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.880
That is, why is this referent the referent of this name, right?

21:14.880 --> 21:17.200
Why is Jay-Z the name of this guy?

21:17.200 --> 21:20.160
Oh, well, it's because there's some description,

21:20.160 --> 21:21.120
there's some characterization,

21:21.120 --> 21:23.360
there's some mode of presentation of this guy

21:23.360 --> 21:24.800
that's associated with the name,

21:24.800 --> 21:27.280
and he meets that description.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.600
He fits that mode of presentation.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.280
Frege thinks something like that.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.400
Also, there's this famous telescope analogy

21:34.400 --> 21:36.800
that explains how all of these things are related,

21:36.800 --> 21:40.960
and I'm gonna use this in my picture of that.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.440
That's a pretty good drawing.

21:47.440 --> 21:50.000
Let's read the quote and figure out what Frege is saying.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.320
Somebody observes the moon through a telescope.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.640
I compare the moon itself to the referent.

21:54.640 --> 21:58.240
It is the object of the observation mediated by the real image

21:58.240 --> 22:01.840
projected by the object glass in the interior of the telescope

22:01.840 --> 22:04.000
and by the retinal image of the observer.

22:04.000 --> 22:06.160
The former, I compare to the sense,

22:06.160 --> 22:09.120
the latter to the conception or experience.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.480
Okay, so there's a person who's looking through a telescope

22:12.480 --> 22:13.840
and they see the moon,

22:13.840 --> 22:16.400
and there's three things involved here.

22:16.400 --> 22:20.400
There's the moon, there's the image of the moon

22:20.400 --> 22:23.600
on the piece of glass inside the telescope,

22:23.600 --> 22:27.120
and then there's the image on the inside of the person's eye

22:27.120 --> 22:28.000
on their retina.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.920
That's like the back of the eye or something.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.200
There's the image that is reflected inside their eyeball.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.560
The moon is analogous to the referent.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.880
It's the object out there in the world.

22:40.880 --> 22:43.680
The image on the inside of the telescope

22:43.680 --> 22:45.920
is analogous to the sense, right?

22:45.920 --> 22:47.920
Because a sense is a public thing,

22:47.920 --> 22:49.840
and different people could come

22:49.840 --> 22:50.960
and look through the telescope

22:50.960 --> 22:53.520
and they would see the very same image

22:53.520 --> 22:55.120
on the glass inside the telescope.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.480
It's not the object out there,

22:56.480 --> 22:57.840
but it's still something public

22:57.840 --> 22:59.760
that different people can interact with.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.280
It's common property.

23:01.280 --> 23:04.080
And then there's the image on a person's retina.

23:04.640 --> 23:06.640
That is analogous to the conception,

23:06.640 --> 23:07.360
the mental conception.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.960
That's a totally private thing.

23:08.960 --> 23:12.480
Only you can see the images on the back of your retina.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.240
No one else can come and look at those.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.600
The purpose of this analogy

23:15.600 --> 23:17.920
is just to explain how all of these things,

23:17.920 --> 23:19.280
the referent, the sense,

23:19.280 --> 23:21.600
and the conception are related to one another.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.080
Frege actually doesn't care about mental stuff,

23:24.080 --> 23:26.320
like your associated mental conception

23:26.320 --> 23:27.760
or experience or whatever.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.760
This is irrelevant really.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.080
When he's talking about the meanings of terms,

23:32.080 --> 23:34.720
he's just talking about the sense and the reference.

23:34.720 --> 23:38.000
But he has to mention all of this stuff about conception

23:38.000 --> 23:40.480
just so that his readers don't accidentally

23:40.480 --> 23:43.120
or mistakenly think that when he talks about sense,

23:43.120 --> 23:45.440
he's talking about some private mental thing,

23:45.440 --> 23:47.680
he's clarifying that that's not what he's talking about.

23:49.200 --> 23:50.960
Okay, now things get real.

23:52.480 --> 23:53.360
Up to this point,

23:53.360 --> 23:55.360
we've only been talking about names

23:55.360 --> 23:57.440
or maybe subject expressions,

23:57.440 --> 23:57.760
whatever.

23:57.760 --> 24:00.080
We weren't talking about whole sentences.

24:00.080 --> 24:03.520
Now, Frege is going to start talking about the sense

24:03.520 --> 24:05.200
and the reference of whole sentences,

24:05.200 --> 24:08.560
like Sean Carter is rich or Jay-Z is rich.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.560
The thing you have to absolutely understand

24:12.560 --> 24:15.360
in order to understand what happens in this part of the paper

24:15.360 --> 24:17.600
is the idea of compositionality.

24:17.600 --> 24:20.560
I have a whole other video explaining compositionality

24:20.560 --> 24:21.920
and if you haven't watched that,

24:21.920 --> 24:24.160
you got to go watch it, link in the description.

24:24.160 --> 24:26.800
But very briefly, the idea is this.

24:26.800 --> 24:30.480
The meaning of a whole sentence is composed of

24:30.480 --> 24:34.560
or built up out of the meanings of the individual parts.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.760
So the meaning of this sentence, Jay-Z is rich,

24:37.760 --> 24:40.720
is made up out of the meaning of Jay-Z,

24:40.720 --> 24:43.200
the meaning of is, and the meaning of rich.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.240
You put those together,

24:44.240 --> 24:45.360
there's some rules for that,

24:45.360 --> 24:47.440
and you get the meaning of the whole sentence.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.120
This is a fact about language,

24:49.120 --> 24:51.440
and Frege takes it very seriously.

24:51.440 --> 24:54.160
He thinks that compositionality is operating

24:54.160 --> 24:57.200
at both the level of sense and reference.

24:57.200 --> 25:01.040
If terms, if linguistic terms have sort of two levels of meaning,

25:01.040 --> 25:03.840
they have the level of sense and the level of reference,

25:03.840 --> 25:08.800
then those, the sense bits are all going to add up together

25:08.880 --> 25:11.680
to give you the sense of a whole sentence.

25:11.680 --> 25:15.120
And also, all the references are going to add up together

25:15.120 --> 25:17.520
to give you the reference of a whole sentence.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.840
So what he's trying to do in this part of the paper,

25:19.840 --> 25:21.040
the middle of the paper,

25:21.040 --> 25:22.640
is he's trying to figure out,

25:22.640 --> 25:24.880
okay, I've already basically said

25:24.880 --> 25:28.080
what the sense and reference of like a name is,

25:28.080 --> 25:30.800
what's the sense and reference of a whole sentence?

25:30.800 --> 25:34.320
And he's constrained in his answer to that question

25:34.320 --> 25:35.760
by compositionality.

25:35.760 --> 25:39.040
The only thing that could be the sense of a sentence

25:39.040 --> 25:41.280
is something that could be made up out of

25:41.280 --> 25:44.320
the senses of those individual words or terms.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.240
And the only thing that could be the reference

25:46.240 --> 25:48.080
of a whole sentence is something

25:48.080 --> 25:49.920
that could be made up out of

25:49.920 --> 25:53.200
the references of all the individual words or terms.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.600
The first thing that Frege considers

25:55.600 --> 25:57.840
as a possible sense or reference

25:57.840 --> 25:59.920
of a whole declarative sentence

25:59.920 --> 26:02.240
is what today we call a proposition.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.080
Frege doesn't call it a proposition,

26:04.080 --> 26:05.600
he calls it a thought.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.200
Now, that's confusing because normally

26:07.200 --> 26:08.080
when you think of thought,

26:08.080 --> 26:09.760
you think of a private mental thing,

26:09.760 --> 26:11.680
and that's not what Frege is talking about here.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.200
When he says thought,

26:13.200 --> 26:18.160
he means the publicly available meaning of a sentence.

26:18.160 --> 26:20.320
Is this thought now to be regarded

26:20.320 --> 26:22.240
as its sense or its reference?

26:22.240 --> 26:23.680
So the question is,

26:23.680 --> 26:27.520
is the proposition or the thought associated with a sentence,

26:27.520 --> 26:29.360
is that the sense of the sentence

26:29.360 --> 26:31.360
or the reference of the sentence?

26:31.360 --> 26:33.120
Let us assume for the time being

26:33.120 --> 26:34.720
that the sentence has a reference.

26:34.720 --> 26:37.600
If we now replace one word of the sentence by another,

26:37.600 --> 26:38.800
having the same reference,

26:38.800 --> 26:40.160
but a different sense,

26:40.160 --> 26:41.760
this can have no influence

26:41.760 --> 26:43.440
upon the reference of the sentence.

26:43.440 --> 26:46.240
Ah, so Frege has found a little test

26:46.240 --> 26:48.240
to tell whether the proposition

26:48.240 --> 26:49.680
or the thought or whatever

26:49.680 --> 26:51.920
is the sense of the sentence or the reference.

26:51.920 --> 26:54.480
He realizes that there are these terms,

26:54.480 --> 26:56.160
Sean Carter and Jay-Z,

26:56.160 --> 26:58.080
which have different senses,

26:58.080 --> 26:59.200
but the same reference.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.280
And so if you switch between the two,

27:01.280 --> 27:03.920
if you swap out this name,

27:04.000 --> 27:04.880
Sean Carter,

27:04.880 --> 27:06.960
and you put in this name Jay-Z

27:06.960 --> 27:08.080
into the same sentence,

27:08.080 --> 27:09.840
that's the difference between three and four,

27:09.840 --> 27:11.280
if you swap them out

27:11.280 --> 27:14.240
because these two names have the same reference,

27:15.040 --> 27:17.600
then switching between these two sentences

27:17.600 --> 27:20.320
should not change the reference of the whole sentence,

27:20.320 --> 27:22.800
but it should change at least sometimes

27:22.800 --> 27:24.560
the sense of these sentences.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.160
We're just switching out two terms.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.560
We're going from a term with one sense

27:28.560 --> 27:29.920
to a term with a different sense.

27:29.920 --> 27:31.360
So these two sentences

27:31.360 --> 27:32.960
should have different senses.

27:32.960 --> 27:36.320
But because these two names have the same reference,

27:36.320 --> 27:39.040
these two sentences should have the same reference.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.880
Frege is trying to figure out

27:40.880 --> 27:42.560
whether or not the proposition

27:42.560 --> 27:45.280
or the thought expressed by a sentence

27:45.280 --> 27:46.880
is the sense or the reference.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.720
Well, there's this constraint.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.040
These two sentences

27:51.040 --> 27:53.680
will have different senses,

27:53.680 --> 27:55.600
but the same reference.

27:55.600 --> 27:58.000
Yet we can see that in such a case,

27:58.000 --> 27:59.600
the thought changes.

27:59.600 --> 28:02.480
Frege notices that these two sentences

28:03.120 --> 28:04.800
express different propositions.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.480
They express different thoughts.

28:06.480 --> 28:10.320
So the thought cannot be the reference of a name

28:10.320 --> 28:12.560
because the thought changes between these two,

28:12.560 --> 28:14.080
but the reference can't change

28:14.080 --> 28:17.600
because this name has the same reference as this name,

28:17.600 --> 28:19.360
this has the same reference as this.

28:19.360 --> 28:21.280
These are referentially the same.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.880
So if something changes,

28:22.880 --> 28:23.840
if the thought changes,

28:23.840 --> 28:25.680
then the thought has to be the sense,

28:25.680 --> 28:26.880
not the reference.

28:26.880 --> 28:28.160
The thought, accordingly,

28:28.160 --> 28:30.240
cannot be the reference of the sentence,

28:30.240 --> 28:32.640
but must rather be considered as the sense.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.160
Okay, so having figured out

28:34.160 --> 28:36.160
what the sense of a whole sentence is,

28:36.160 --> 28:38.080
it's the proposition expressed by that sentence,

28:38.080 --> 28:40.160
the next question is, well, what's the reference?

28:40.160 --> 28:42.560
What is the reference of a declarative sentence

28:42.560 --> 28:44.240
like this or like this?

28:44.240 --> 28:45.600
Sean Carter is rich.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.560
Jay-Z is rich.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.400
We know what these names refer to.

28:48.400 --> 28:50.000
They refer to the guy.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.080
What do the whole sentences refer to?

28:52.080 --> 28:53.760
And once again, when figuring this out,

28:53.760 --> 28:56.320
Frege is constrained by compositionality.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.560
Whatever this thing the reference is,

28:58.560 --> 29:01.920
it's gonna have to somehow be built up out of

29:01.920 --> 29:04.320
the references of all the individual parts.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.640
And this gives Frege an argument

29:06.640 --> 29:09.760
for why the reference of a declarative sentence like this

29:09.760 --> 29:11.840
is that sentence's truth value.

29:12.960 --> 29:15.200
The truth value of a declarative sentence

29:15.200 --> 29:17.520
is just whether or not the sentence is true or false.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.280
There's two possible truth values.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.680
True is one of them, false is the other.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.680
You know, this sentence, Jay-Z is rich.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.400
That's true.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.080
Its truth value is true.

29:26.080 --> 29:30.160
So Frege thinks that this whole sentence

29:30.240 --> 29:33.520
refers to truth or the true.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.880
That's what it refers to.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.880
Okay, weird, but he has an argument

29:36.880 --> 29:39.200
for why he thinks this has to be the case.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.680
The reference of a whole declarative sentence

29:41.680 --> 29:43.440
has to be composed up

29:43.440 --> 29:45.840
out of the references of the individual parts.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.920
Therefore, any change in the reference

29:47.920 --> 29:49.600
of any of the individual parts

29:49.600 --> 29:53.200
must result in a change in the reference of the whole sentence.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.520
And whenever there is not a change

29:55.520 --> 29:57.360
in the reference of the individual parts,

29:57.360 --> 29:59.680
like when switching between three and four,

29:59.680 --> 30:01.600
the references of all of these parts,

30:01.600 --> 30:04.080
this name, this, this, this name, this, this,

30:04.080 --> 30:06.320
the references of all this stays the same

30:06.320 --> 30:07.760
when you switch from three to four.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.920
So the reference of these whole sentences

30:09.920 --> 30:11.200
has to stay the same.

30:11.200 --> 30:13.280
Therefore, whatever the references

30:13.280 --> 30:15.040
of these declarative sentences are,

30:15.040 --> 30:16.240
they have to be the same.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.280
These two sentences have to have the same reference

30:19.280 --> 30:21.840
because all of their parts have the same reference

30:21.840 --> 30:24.000
because Sean Carter and Jay-Z

30:24.000 --> 30:26.400
are two different names with the same reference.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.520
These two names are what's called co-referring terms.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.040
Co-referring terms.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.400
Co-referring terms.

30:32.400 --> 30:34.160
They refer to the same thing.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.880
And so this test that Frege has come up with is,

30:36.880 --> 30:40.240
oh, well, if you swap out one term

30:40.240 --> 30:42.560
for another term that's co-referring,

30:42.560 --> 30:45.280
right, if you go from sentence three to sentence four,

30:45.280 --> 30:46.800
if you do this swap,

30:46.800 --> 30:49.120
you have to always preserve

30:49.120 --> 30:50.720
the reference of the whole sentence.

30:50.720 --> 30:53.040
So then the question for Frege is very simple.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.280
What is something about these sentences

30:55.280 --> 30:57.360
that always stays the same

30:57.360 --> 31:00.080
whenever you swap out co-referring terms?

31:00.080 --> 31:02.080
Whenever you go from a sentence like three

31:02.080 --> 31:03.520
to a sentence like four,

31:03.520 --> 31:05.760
what stays the same every time?

31:05.760 --> 31:07.280
Well, it's not the thought.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.120
It's not the cognitive value.

31:09.120 --> 31:10.160
The thought changes.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.760
That's the sense and that changes.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.040
It's the truth value.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.800
Whenever you swap in a different name for this guy,

31:16.800 --> 31:19.440
the resulting sentence will always have

31:19.440 --> 31:22.080
the same truth value as these two.

31:23.360 --> 31:24.960
And there it is, hove.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.000
Hove is rich.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.200
That's true as well.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.680
This is true, this is true, and this is true.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.920
You're never gonna be able to get a sentence

31:31.920 --> 31:34.560
that just switches in a co-referring term here

31:34.560 --> 31:36.480
and all of a sudden that sentence is false

31:36.480 --> 31:38.000
whereas all of these remain true.

31:38.000 --> 31:39.120
You're never gonna get that

31:39.120 --> 31:41.920
because the truth value always stays the same

31:41.920 --> 31:43.920
when you swap in co-referring terms

31:43.920 --> 31:45.360
and that is Frege's argument

31:45.360 --> 31:48.160
for why the truth value of a declarative sentence

31:48.160 --> 31:50.400
is the reference of that sentence.

31:50.400 --> 31:53.360
And the same would hold if these sentences were false, right?

31:53.360 --> 31:56.080
If instead of saying Sean Carter is rich,

31:56.080 --> 31:58.800
this sentence said Sean Carter is enshrined

31:58.800 --> 32:01.040
in the country music hall of fame,

32:01.040 --> 32:02.720
well then three would be false

32:02.720 --> 32:05.120
but then the same sentence where you swap in Jay-Z,

32:05.120 --> 32:06.560
that would also be false.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.080
Hove would also be false.

32:08.080 --> 32:11.280
Any sentence that is false of Sean Carter

32:11.280 --> 32:14.160
is also false of Jay-Z, is also false of Hove.

32:14.160 --> 32:17.120
Swapping out these names with different senses

32:17.120 --> 32:20.560
but the same reference changes the thought or proposition

32:20.560 --> 32:22.640
but never changes the truth value.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.240
At least that's true in the case

32:24.240 --> 32:25.840
of simple sentences like this.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.480
More complex sentences with like quotations

32:28.480 --> 32:29.920
and things like that, this won't work

32:29.920 --> 32:31.760
but we're not gonna worry about that now.

32:31.760 --> 32:34.960
Let's just read Frege's argument for this conclusion.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.280
If our supposition that the reference of a sentence

32:37.280 --> 32:39.200
is its truth value is correct,

32:39.200 --> 32:40.960
the latter, that is the truth value,

32:40.960 --> 32:42.640
must remain unchanged

32:42.640 --> 32:44.480
when a part of the sentence is replaced

32:44.480 --> 32:46.800
by an expression having the same reference

32:46.800 --> 32:48.400
and this is in fact the case.

32:48.400 --> 32:50.720
Right, cool, that's just what we were saying.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.000
Leibniz explains,

32:52.960 --> 33:00.080
That's my best shot pronouncing the Latin.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.120
It means equal are those which for each other

33:03.120 --> 33:05.920
mutually substituted can be saving the truth.

33:05.920 --> 33:08.400
And what that means in comprehensible English

33:08.400 --> 33:10.000
is just that what it is to say

33:10.000 --> 33:11.840
that two things are the same thing

33:11.840 --> 33:14.080
is that every sentence that's true of one

33:14.080 --> 33:15.040
is true of the other.

33:15.040 --> 33:17.360
What else but the truth value could be found

33:17.360 --> 33:19.840
that belongs quite generally to every sentence

33:19.840 --> 33:22.000
concerned with the reference of its components

33:22.000 --> 33:24.240
and remains unchanged by substitutions

33:24.240 --> 33:25.200
of the kind in question.

33:25.200 --> 33:28.320
Frege is asking what could it be that stays the same

33:28.320 --> 33:30.400
when you keep doing this substituting

33:30.400 --> 33:31.760
other than the truth value

33:31.760 --> 33:33.520
and the implied answer to this question

33:33.520 --> 33:34.880
though he doesn't say it in the paper,

33:34.880 --> 33:36.320
the implied answer is nothing.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.920
There's nothing other than the truth value

33:37.920 --> 33:39.440
that fits this role

33:39.440 --> 33:42.240
and therefore the truth value of a declarative sentence

33:42.240 --> 33:43.600
has to be its reference.

33:44.480 --> 33:46.720
Okay, those are all the major claims in the paper.

33:46.720 --> 33:48.640
There's a whole bunch of other weird grammatical stuff

33:48.640 --> 33:49.760
in the second half of the paper,

33:49.760 --> 33:51.360
but no one ever talks about that

33:51.360 --> 33:53.760
and I'm not assigning that to my students.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.760
So this video is done.
