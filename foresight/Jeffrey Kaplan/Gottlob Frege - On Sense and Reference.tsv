0	3280	This guy, Gottlob Frege, published this paper
3280	8240	Ã¼ber Sinn und Bedeutung on Sense and Reference in 1892.
8240	12640	And it is the most important paper in the history of the philosophy of language.
12640	17360	It is very complicated, but I'm going to explain it now.
19200	24160	Frege realizes that linguistic terms, words, have to have two levels of meaning.
24160	26720	They each have to have a sense and a reference.
26720	28960	I'm going to explain exactly what those are,
28960	33520	but first we need to see the puzzle that forces Frege into this position.
33520	37360	To illustrate this puzzle, I'm going to have you watch like a viral video.
56720	74320	Okay, that was fun.
74320	78320	The noteworthy thing about this interaction is that the woman, her name is Ellen,
79120	83520	she already knows the meaning of the name Jay-Z.
83520	86160	So it's not like what happens is that the guy tells her,
86160	90400	oh, there's this name Jay-Z and the name refers to me.
90400	91040	It's my name.
91040	91920	That's not what happens.
91920	93760	No, no, she's familiar with the name.
93760	95280	She knows the meaning of Jay-Z,
95920	100480	but she still learns something at the end of the video
100480	102560	when he tells her that he is Jay-Z.
104160	106000	So there's like two possibilities.
106000	109200	She could learn something linguistic about the name,
109200	111520	or she could learn something empirical.
111600	115920	Empirical just means knowable by observation or experience.
115920	118240	Another term for this is a posteriori.
118240	121520	And the point of this story is just that what this woman learns
121520	125120	at the end of the conversation is not linguistic.
125120	128160	She's not learning anything about the meaning of the name Jay-Z.
128160	129360	She already knew that name.
129920	133520	She's learning an empirical fact, a fact about the world,
133520	137440	which is, oh, this guy that I've been sitting next to, he is Jay-Z.
138240	141680	Consider these two sentences.
141680	147040	Sean Carter is Sean Carter and Sean Carter is Jay-Z.
147040	151600	That's Jay-Z's government name, his regular name.
151600	153040	Sean Carter, that's his name.
153040	156240	Sentences of this type are called identity statements
156240	159120	because they say that two things are one thing.
159120	160160	Two things are identical.
160160	161520	They're the very same thing.
161520	165680	Imagine in the case of Ellen and Jay-Z on the subway,
165680	168320	imagine that she knew him by the name Sean Carter.
168320	169920	Like maybe he got on the train
169920	172320	and they introduced themselves to each other
172320	174720	and he introduced himself as Sean Carter.
174720	175600	That's his name.
175600	177200	She knows who Sean Carter is
178000	180880	and she also knows that there's this musician,
180880	182560	this rapper named Jay-Z.
182560	184000	Maybe she's seen pictures of him.
184000	185280	She knows who Jay-Z is.
185280	188160	But she hasn't yet put it together in her mind
188160	192160	that this guy right next to her, Sean Carter, is Jay-Z.
192160	193520	If that's the case,
193520	198160	then sentence number two can be informative to her.
198160	201360	It has, as Frege says, cognitive value.
201360	204240	You can really learn something from sentence number two.
204240	206720	This woman, Ellen, can really learn something
207520	211040	by discovering or being told that Sean Carter is Jay-Z.
212160	215120	So I'm writing here that sentence two is informative.
215120	218320	It can teach her something in the way that sentence one never could.
218320	219840	Sean Carter is Sean Carter.
219840	221200	Yes, of course.
221200	223840	As long as these two names, here and here,
223840	226720	are being used in the same sense to mean the same thing,
226720	229440	well then one is totally banal and uninformative,
229440	232000	whereas two can be informative.
233120	235840	But sentence two can also be empirical
235840	238800	in the sense that the information that you get from sentence two
238800	242240	can be, in some cases, not about language,
242240	243920	not about the meanings of the words,
243920	246160	but it can be something that has to be discovered
246160	248640	through going out into the world and existing
248720	250480	and discovering things like, namely,
250480	253280	oh, this guy sitting next to me, he's a famous rapper.
253280	254800	That's the point of this example.
254800	256640	In the middle of the train ride,
256640	259440	Ellen knows all the linguistic facts.
259440	263040	She knows what this name, Sean Carter, means.
263040	264560	She knows who it refers to.
264560	266240	It refers to this guy sitting next to me.
266240	269520	She also is familiar with and understands the name Jay-Z.
269520	271840	She knows, oh, that's the name for this famous musician.
271840	274320	Maybe she can name a whole bunch of facts about Jay-Z.
274320	276320	She can know all the linguistic facts,
276320	279200	but still there's that moment at the end of the train ride
279200	282000	where she learns something like sentence two.
282000	284960	She learns that this guy, Sean Carter, is Jay-Z.
284960	287920	And so what she learns can't be linguistic
287920	289680	because she already knew the linguistic stuff.
289680	293200	It has to be some empirical fact about the real world,
293200	295760	some observable experiential fact.
295760	297360	Now we're ready to state the puzzle.
297360	301280	How can we have a theory of language, a theory of names,
301280	304640	that explains these two features of sentence number two,
304640	306480	that it can be informative,
306480	308720	and then more specifically, the kind of information
308720	312240	that it can give can be empirical information.
312240	316640	The reason this is a puzzle is that there was this other theory
316640	320720	of names published in 1881 by John Stuart Mill
320720	322480	and according to Mill's theory,
322480	326480	the meaning of a proper name like Sean Carter or Jay-Z,
326480	328880	the meaning of a name like that is nothing more
328880	330320	than the object named.
330320	332560	And Mill's theory sounds really good
332560	335280	when you read that paper that he published in 1881,
335280	337280	but then you run into cases like this
337280	338480	and he can't handle this.
338480	340480	According to Mill, the name Sean Carter
340480	343600	and the name Jay-Z mean exactly the same thing.
343600	346240	And so sentence one and sentence two are no different.
346240	349360	Mill is unable to explain why a sentence like two
349360	352160	can be genuinely illuminating, informative,
352160	354240	why it can have some cognitive value
354240	356000	in a way that a sentence like one doesn't.
356000	358320	Because after all, on Mill's theory,
358320	361520	the meaning of these letters right here is just the dude
361600	363280	and the meaning of these letters right here
363280	364480	is the exact same dude.
364480	367680	So it's just this dude is this dude.
367680	371360	Yeah, duh, just like in this case, this dude is this dude.
371360	372320	There's no difference.
372320	374720	Now there's an alternative to Mill's theory
374720	377600	that can explain how sentence two
377600	380400	can be illuminating, informative,
380400	382160	in a way that sentence one can't.
382160	385680	And that theory translates sentence two
385680	388880	as a sentence about language itself.
389760	394000	On this theory, sentence two is really just shorthand
394000	396240	for something like sentence two star.
396240	401120	The name Sean Carter and the name Jay-Z denote the same person.
401120	402560	If this is what two means,
402560	405840	then it makes sense why two is informative
405840	407200	in a way that one isn't.
407200	409440	One would be translated correspondingly
409440	411360	as something like the name Sean Carter
411360	414320	and the name Sean Carter denote the same person.
414320	415280	That's obvious.
415280	416560	But this is not obvious.
416560	419040	Like this is a fact that you might not know.
419040	423120	And this theory that translates identity statements like this
423120	425600	into sort of linguistic statements like this,
425600	428560	that theory is actually Fraga's old theory
428560	432080	from the Begriff Schrift, which he published in 1879.
432080	437840	But 13 years went by between 1879 and 1892
437840	439760	when he published On Sense and Reference.
439760	443520	And during those 13 years, Fraga realized that this theory,
443520	445600	the theory that translates identity statements
445600	447760	into linguistic statements like this,
447760	449360	that theory wasn't good.
449360	452960	And the reason is that statements like number two here
452960	455360	can be informative, not just informative,
455360	457040	but empirically informative.
457040	460080	The idea is simply that when Ellen had this moment
460080	461680	of realization on the subway,
461680	464560	she wasn't realizing something about the meanings
464560	467040	of these terms, she was realizing something
467040	468320	about the world around her.
468320	469280	And Fraga gets this.
469280	471920	He understands all this stuff about Ellen and Jay-Z.
471920	474320	And so what he does in On Sense and Reference
474400	476640	is he tosses out his old theory
476640	479200	and he gives a new theory of sentences like that.
479200	482640	And it turns out to be not just a theory of identity statements
482640	484640	like this, but of all of language.
486160	488240	Very quickly, I'm going to illustrate this again
488240	489760	with Fraga's own example,
489760	493040	which involves the morning star and the evening star.
493040	493680	To understand this,
493680	496880	you're going to need some astronomical background information.
496880	497760	So here it is.
497760	501440	If you look at the sunrise, just before sunrise,
501440	504480	right near where the sun is about to rise,
504480	506960	you can see a very bright star, sometimes.
506960	509520	And the name of that star is the morning star.
509520	512480	And then also just after sunset,
512480	515200	right near where the sun just set,
515200	518160	sometimes you can see this other bright star
518160	520720	and that star is called the evening star.
520720	522960	Okay, those are stars and people have known
522960	524480	about these stars for a long time
524480	526960	and they name the stars because we name things.
526960	529280	But then at some point, someone discovered
529280	532320	that these two stars were the exact same thing.
532320	533840	And they're not even stars.
533840	536240	It turns out they are the planet Venus.
536800	539840	So what you've got are sort of trivial sentences
539840	542480	like the morning star is the morning star.
542480	543600	Yeah, duh.
543600	546720	And then you've got possibly very informative,
546720	550640	noteworthy sentences like the morning star is the evening star.
550640	553120	So just like in the case of this sentence too,
553120	554960	this sentence too can be informative.
554960	557600	And the kind of information that this sentence carries
557680	559680	is not linguistic information,
559680	563280	but empirical astronomical information.
563280	564560	Someone can be in a situation
564560	566480	where they know the meaning of this name
566480	568480	or this phrase or whatever the morning star.
568480	569520	They know which star it is.
569520	570480	They can even point to it.
570480	572400	They can even say that one's the morning star.
572400	575600	That's the object denoted by the name
575600	577920	or the description, the morning star.
577920	579920	And they can do the same thing, let's suppose,
579920	580880	for the evening star.
580880	582080	They know what this phrase means
582080	582960	and they can point to it.
582960	586160	So they know what is denoted by all of these terms,
586240	587680	but what they don't know
587680	590640	is that these two objects are one object.
590640	592240	And so when you tell someone
592240	594560	the morning star is the evening star,
594560	596240	you can be telling them something
596240	597680	that they didn't know already
597680	599600	and not something linguistic at all.
599600	601520	And Mill's theory of names
601520	603600	and Frago's old theory of names
603600	606240	that translates identity statements
606240	608800	into these linguistic statements or whatever,
608800	610240	neither of those theories
610240	614640	can explain these facts about this sentence and this sentence.
614640	615760	That they are informative
615760	618080	and that the kind of information that they can give
618080	620000	is often empirical.
620000	621680	Okay, so that's the puzzle.
621680	622560	That's the problem.
622560	624000	And what Frago does
624000	626000	is he solves this problem
626000	629440	by introducing an additional layer of meaning.
629440	632080	And that sort of additional middle layer
632080	634880	of the meaning of a term is the sense.
634880	636000	It is natural now
636000	638320	to think of their being connected with a sign,
638320	640400	a name, combination of words, letter,
640400	642800	besides that to which the sign refers,
642800	644560	which may be called the referent of the sign.
644560	647680	Also, what I would like to call the sense of the sign,
647680	650720	wherein the mode of presentation is contained.
650720	653440	Okay, so Frago is talking about three different things.
655040	657760	The first thing is the name or the sign.
658800	659760	And then of course,
659760	662480	there's the thing that the name picks out
662480	664480	or refers to the referent,
664480	667120	which in this case, the referent is the guy,
667120	668560	the actual person, Jay-Z.
669680	671360	But in addition to the referent,
671360	673680	Frago is saying that there's this other
673760	675440	middle level of meaning,
675440	676880	which he calls the sense.
678880	681680	And it's really not clear at this point in the paper
681680	684960	what the sense of a name or of any expression is,
684960	687680	but it has something to do with a mode of presentation.
687680	689280	So I have to explain what that is.
689280	691920	Are you familiar with the concept of a McMansion?
691920	694480	That's like a poorly constructed ugly home
694480	696320	with too many roof lines or whatever.
696320	698400	Imagine one of these ugly houses.
698400	699760	And in the front of the house,
699760	703600	there's like fancy stonework or bricks or columns
703680	704560	or something like that.
704560	707680	But in the back of the house, it's just plastic siding.
707680	708800	So you can imagine a case
708800	710960	where you've seen this house from the front.
710960	713520	That's one way of viewing the house,
713520	716720	one literal angle or perspective
716720	718320	from which you can view the house.
718320	720400	You might also see the house from the back.
720400	722320	That's a different perspective,
722320	724880	a different mode of presentation of the house,
724880	727760	a different way that the house could be presented to you.
727760	730880	And you can know the house in both of these ways
730880	733200	without actually knowing that they're the same house.
733200	735600	And then it might be informative to you to find out,
735600	737840	oh, look at that, that's the same one house.
737840	739280	That's what Frege is getting at
739280	741120	with this idea of a mode of presentation.
741120	744880	There are two different ways of knowing Sean Carter.
744880	749600	You could know him as the kid from Brooklyn or whatever.
749600	752800	Or you could know him as Jay-Z, the mogul,
752800	755120	the billionaire rapper or whatever.
755120	756320	I don't know if he has a billion dollars,
756320	760000	but close to a billion or a little more, I think.
760000	762880	The simplest way, although this is a little contentious,
762880	766240	to think of the sense or mode of presentation
766240	769840	of a name or phrase is to think of it as a description.
769840	775840	You could describe this guy as a billionaire music mogul
775840	779520	or you could describe him as a middle-aged man
779520	780960	who was born in Brooklyn
780960	783760	and still lives most of the time in the greater New York area.
783760	786880	Those are two different ways of presenting
786880	791280	or characterizing this guy, Sean Carter or Jay-Z.
791360	793040	Frege's point is this.
793040	796400	A name, or for that matter, any other linguistic term,
797120	800640	a name has not only this level of meaning,
800640	802800	which is the object named,
802800	806720	but also the way that that object is characterized
806720	810560	or presented by the sign, by the name.
810560	812640	Frege himself actually explains this,
812640	815520	though with a somewhat abstract mathematical example
815520	818640	that might not have been obvious from just reading the text.
818640	821440	So I'm going to read it and then explain exactly what he means.
821440	825680	Let ABC be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle
825680	827760	with the midpoints of the opposite sides.
827760	831760	Okay, so there's no actual diagram in the published paper,
831760	834320	but I created this diagram.
834320	836880	You see that inside of this triangle, there are three lines.
836880	839360	There's the vertical line, which is called A,
839360	842080	and then there's this other line, that's line B,
842080	844400	and then line C is the third line
844400	846080	going from the lower right to the upper left.
846080	847520	And the important thing to notice
847520	849840	is that all three of these lines intersect,
849840	853360	they cross each other or meet at the very same point in the middle.
853360	855840	The point of intersection of A and B
855840	859280	is then the same as the point of intersection of B and C.
859280	862400	So there's just one point here in the middle of this diagram,
862400	865040	but Frege mentions at least two different ways
865040	867040	of describing that exact same point,
867040	870000	the place where lines A and B intersect,
870000	872160	or you could describe the very same point
872160	875200	as the place where lines B and C intersect.
875200	877040	So we have different designations
877040	878240	for the same point.
878240	881040	And these names, point of intersection of A and B,
881040	882960	point of intersection of B and C,
882960	885840	likewise indicate the mode of presentation.
885840	888240	So these two different names for the one point,
888240	890960	the point of intersection of A and B,
890960	893520	and the point of intersection of C and D,
893520	895760	these two names, they pick out the same point,
895760	899120	but they present that point in different ways.
899120	902320	They involve different modes of presentation
902320	903680	of that same point.
903680	906480	And hence, the statement contains true knowledge.
906480	908160	What he means by that is just that
908160	911840	because these two different names for that one point
911840	914400	have different modes of presentation,
914400	916720	that sentence, the sentence that
916720	919280	the point of intersection of A and B
919280	922560	is the same as the point of intersection of B and C,
922560	925360	that sentence, like sentence two here,
925360	928400	can contain real genuine information,
928400	930320	true knowledge, as Frege calls it.
930320	932080	In our example, accordingly,
932080	933760	the reference of the expressions
933760	935600	the point of intersection of A and B
935600	937840	and the point of intersection of B and C
937840	940320	would be the same, but not their senses.
940320	944320	Right, so these two names have the same referent,
944320	946240	but different senses,
946240	948480	different ways of presenting that referent.
948480	951360	That's exactly what's going on with Sean Carter and Jay-Z.
951360	955040	These two names, they refer to the same guy,
955040	956480	they have the same referent,
956480	958320	but they have different senses.
958320	960880	They present him in different ways.
960880	962800	And it's the same way with the example
962800	964800	of the morning star and the evening star.
964800	967360	The referent of evening star would be the same
967360	969840	as that of morning star, but not the sense.
969840	973520	So those two names, the morning star and the evening star,
973520	975280	they have the same referent,
975280	976640	which happens to be Venus,
976640	979360	but they present that referent differently.
979360	983600	They make reference to Venus via different senses.
983600	986240	And this theory, this theory that says
986240	988480	that for all the linguistic signs,
988480	990400	there are two levels of meaning,
990400	992640	the level of sense and the level of reference.
992720	996160	This theory can explain both of these facts
996160	998320	about identity statements like two.
998320	1001200	It can explain why these sentences are informative
1001200	1003280	and it can explain why that information
1003280	1005520	can be non-linguistic and empirical.
1005520	1007200	It's possible for one to already know
1007200	1009360	the linguistic information.
1009360	1013040	One knows the sense of Sean Carter, the meaning.
1013040	1017360	And one knows the sense of the term or name Jay-Z.
1017360	1020080	But then one can find out, oh!
1020080	1021040	Oh!
1021040	1024080	These two terms that I already know the meaning to,
1024080	1026320	they refer to the very same guy.
1026320	1028320	That is how Frege solves the puzzle.
1028320	1030560	Oh, but there's more, there's like way more.
1030560	1033280	The regular connection between a sign, its sense
1033280	1035200	and its referent is of such a kind
1035200	1038080	that to the sign, there corresponds a definite sense
1038080	1040560	and to that, in turn, a definite referent.
1040560	1042880	The point Frege is making there is just that
1042880	1047200	in the normal case, for one name, there is one sense
1047200	1050000	and then one referent, one to one to one.
1050080	1052560	While to a given referent, an object,
1052560	1055040	there does not belong only a single sign.
1055040	1058480	But if instead we start with the object, the referent,
1058480	1061600	there might be more than one name for that object, right?
1061600	1064640	There might be Jay-Z and Sean Carter and Hove.
1065200	1066480	That's another one, I think.
1066480	1068720	The same sense has different expressions
1068720	1071280	in different languages or even in the same language.
1071280	1072880	Okay, this is an additional point,
1072880	1075920	but Frege thinks that the same sense
1075920	1078480	can be the meaning of different terms.
1078560	1081600	It might be, I'm sort of playing a little fast
1081600	1085200	and loose here, but it might be that Jay-Z
1085200	1088640	and Hove, H-O-V, I'm pretty sure that's how it's spelled,
1088640	1090240	those are two different names,
1090240	1092560	but maybe they present him in the same way.
1092560	1095600	So they have the same sense, two different names,
1095600	1097120	same sense, same referent.
1097120	1099120	That's also possible, Frege thinks.
1099120	1101680	And then there's the case of what are today
1101680	1103520	commonly called empty names.
1103520	1106400	These are names that are meaningful,
1106400	1108400	but they don't refer to anything.
1108400	1110960	It may perhaps be granted that every grammatically
1110960	1113920	well-formed expression representing a proper name
1113920	1115520	always has a sense.
1115520	1118400	This just means that if a name is meaningful,
1118400	1119520	it has a sense.
1119520	1121920	But this is not to say that to the sense,
1121920	1123840	there also corresponds a referent.
1123840	1127200	But just because a name is meaningful and has a sense
1127200	1129920	doesn't mean that there really is an object in the world
1129920	1132480	that is referred to by that name.
1132480	1135280	Frege is going to give us an example right now.
1135280	1138720	The words, the celestial body most distant from the earth
1138720	1140640	have a sense, but it is very doubtful
1140640	1142080	if they also have a referent.
1142080	1145840	The phrase, the celestial body most distant from the earth,
1145840	1148000	that's a perfectly meaningful label,
1148000	1150400	it's a definite description, it has a meaning.
1150400	1152480	Frege just thinks, and I think he's probably right,
1152480	1156240	that there is no object in space that is the one object
1156240	1158080	that is the farthest away from the earth.
1158080	1161360	Maybe because like space curves or I don't know,
1161360	1164000	but there might not be a thing out in the world
1164000	1165280	that's referred to in that way,
1165280	1168000	but nonetheless, the name can be meaningful.
1168000	1170560	Here's another thing that's very important to Frege.
1170560	1175120	It's important that the sense of a term is public.
1175120	1178480	Different people can mean the same thing by a term,
1178480	1180400	and so they have to be able to share the sense.
1180400	1183440	And for that reason, the sense of a term,
1183440	1186000	the mode of presentation contained in the name,
1186000	1187840	blah, blah, blah, all of that,
1187840	1192000	that's not the same as some private mental thing,
1192000	1194640	some conception or image in your mind.
1194640	1198160	It can't be that because that thing in your mind is private.
1198160	1202240	No one else can see your conception can have it.
1202240	1205040	And so whatever private stuff is going on in there,
1205040	1207840	that can't be what Frege means by sense.
1207840	1209840	The referent and sense of a sign
1209840	1212960	are to be distinguished from the associated conception.
1217120	1221760	The associated conception is whatever shows up in someone's mind
1221760	1224640	when they hear this name, and Frege is saying,
1224640	1227440	that is not the sense, and that's not the referent,
1227440	1228880	that's some other thing.
1228880	1231120	This constitutes an essential distinction
1231120	1233520	between the conception and the sign's sense,
1233520	1235440	which may be the common property of many,
1235440	1239280	and therefore is not part or a mode of the individual mind.
1239280	1240640	Frege's point there is simply
1240640	1243840	that the sense of a term is common property.
1243840	1245680	It's something that multiple people can share.
1245680	1247600	And you can see why Frege thinks this.
1248320	1250880	The sense is the meaning of the name,
1250960	1254000	and he wants two different people to mean the exact same thing.
1254000	1256640	If the meaning of a name was some private thing
1256640	1258080	inside your own mind,
1258080	1260320	then you could never mean the exact same thing
1260320	1262160	by a term as someone else.
1262160	1264880	This wasn't in the part of this paper that I've assigned,
1264880	1269280	but Frege also thinks that the sense of a name or a term
1269280	1270720	determines the referent.
1270720	1274880	That is, why is this referent the referent of this name, right?
1274880	1277200	Why is Jay-Z the name of this guy?
1277200	1280160	Oh, well, it's because there's some description,
1280160	1281120	there's some characterization,
1281120	1283360	there's some mode of presentation of this guy
1283360	1284800	that's associated with the name,
1284800	1287280	and he meets that description.
1287280	1289600	He fits that mode of presentation.
1289600	1291280	Frege thinks something like that.
1291280	1294400	Also, there's this famous telescope analogy
1294400	1296800	that explains how all of these things are related,
1296800	1300960	and I'm gonna use this in my picture of that.
1306240	1307440	That's a pretty good drawing.
1307440	1310000	Let's read the quote and figure out what Frege is saying.
1310000	1312320	Somebody observes the moon through a telescope.
1312320	1314640	I compare the moon itself to the referent.
1314640	1318240	It is the object of the observation mediated by the real image
1318240	1321840	projected by the object glass in the interior of the telescope
1321840	1324000	and by the retinal image of the observer.
1324000	1326160	The former, I compare to the sense,
1326160	1329120	the latter to the conception or experience.
1329120	1332480	Okay, so there's a person who's looking through a telescope
1332480	1333840	and they see the moon,
1333840	1336400	and there's three things involved here.
1336400	1340400	There's the moon, there's the image of the moon
1340400	1343600	on the piece of glass inside the telescope,
1343600	1347120	and then there's the image on the inside of the person's eye
1347120	1348000	on their retina.
1348000	1349920	That's like the back of the eye or something.
1349920	1353200	There's the image that is reflected inside their eyeball.
1356000	1358560	The moon is analogous to the referent.
1358560	1360880	It's the object out there in the world.
1360880	1363680	The image on the inside of the telescope
1363680	1365920	is analogous to the sense, right?
1365920	1367920	Because a sense is a public thing,
1367920	1369840	and different people could come
1369840	1370960	and look through the telescope
1370960	1373520	and they would see the very same image
1373520	1375120	on the glass inside the telescope.
1375120	1376480	It's not the object out there,
1376480	1377840	but it's still something public
1377840	1379760	that different people can interact with.
1379760	1381280	It's common property.
1381280	1384080	And then there's the image on a person's retina.
1384640	1386640	That is analogous to the conception,
1386640	1387360	the mental conception.
1387360	1388960	That's a totally private thing.
1388960	1392480	Only you can see the images on the back of your retina.
1392480	1394240	No one else can come and look at those.
1394240	1395600	The purpose of this analogy
1395600	1397920	is just to explain how all of these things,
1397920	1399280	the referent, the sense,
1399280	1401600	and the conception are related to one another.
1401600	1404080	Frege actually doesn't care about mental stuff,
1404080	1406320	like your associated mental conception
1406320	1407760	or experience or whatever.
1407760	1409760	This is irrelevant really.
1409760	1412080	When he's talking about the meanings of terms,
1412080	1414720	he's just talking about the sense and the reference.
1414720	1418000	But he has to mention all of this stuff about conception
1418000	1420480	just so that his readers don't accidentally
1420480	1423120	or mistakenly think that when he talks about sense,
1423120	1425440	he's talking about some private mental thing,
1425440	1427680	he's clarifying that that's not what he's talking about.
1429200	1430960	Okay, now things get real.
1432480	1433360	Up to this point,
1433360	1435360	we've only been talking about names
1435360	1437440	or maybe subject expressions,
1437440	1437760	whatever.
1437760	1440080	We weren't talking about whole sentences.
1440080	1443520	Now, Frege is going to start talking about the sense
1443520	1445200	and the reference of whole sentences,
1445200	1448560	like Sean Carter is rich or Jay-Z is rich.
1450000	1452560	The thing you have to absolutely understand
1452560	1455360	in order to understand what happens in this part of the paper
1455360	1457600	is the idea of compositionality.
1457600	1460560	I have a whole other video explaining compositionality
1460560	1461920	and if you haven't watched that,
1461920	1464160	you got to go watch it, link in the description.
1464160	1466800	But very briefly, the idea is this.
1466800	1470480	The meaning of a whole sentence is composed of
1470480	1474560	or built up out of the meanings of the individual parts.
1474560	1477760	So the meaning of this sentence, Jay-Z is rich,
1477760	1480720	is made up out of the meaning of Jay-Z,
1480720	1483200	the meaning of is, and the meaning of rich.
1483200	1484240	You put those together,
1484240	1485360	there's some rules for that,
1485360	1487440	and you get the meaning of the whole sentence.
1487440	1489120	This is a fact about language,
1489120	1491440	and Frege takes it very seriously.
1491440	1494160	He thinks that compositionality is operating
1494160	1497200	at both the level of sense and reference.
1497200	1501040	If terms, if linguistic terms have sort of two levels of meaning,
1501040	1503840	they have the level of sense and the level of reference,
1503840	1508800	then those, the sense bits are all going to add up together
1508880	1511680	to give you the sense of a whole sentence.
1511680	1515120	And also, all the references are going to add up together
1515120	1517520	to give you the reference of a whole sentence.
1517520	1519840	So what he's trying to do in this part of the paper,
1519840	1521040	the middle of the paper,
1521040	1522640	is he's trying to figure out,
1522640	1524880	okay, I've already basically said
1524880	1528080	what the sense and reference of like a name is,
1528080	1530800	what's the sense and reference of a whole sentence?
1530800	1534320	And he's constrained in his answer to that question
1534320	1535760	by compositionality.
1535760	1539040	The only thing that could be the sense of a sentence
1539040	1541280	is something that could be made up out of
1541280	1544320	the senses of those individual words or terms.
1544320	1546240	And the only thing that could be the reference
1546240	1548080	of a whole sentence is something
1548080	1549920	that could be made up out of
1549920	1553200	the references of all the individual words or terms.
1553200	1555600	The first thing that Frege considers
1555600	1557840	as a possible sense or reference
1557840	1559920	of a whole declarative sentence
1559920	1562240	is what today we call a proposition.
1562240	1564080	Frege doesn't call it a proposition,
1564080	1565600	he calls it a thought.
1565600	1567200	Now, that's confusing because normally
1567200	1568080	when you think of thought,
1568080	1569760	you think of a private mental thing,
1569760	1571680	and that's not what Frege is talking about here.
1571680	1573200	When he says thought,
1573200	1578160	he means the publicly available meaning of a sentence.
1578160	1580320	Is this thought now to be regarded
1580320	1582240	as its sense or its reference?
1582240	1583680	So the question is,
1583680	1587520	is the proposition or the thought associated with a sentence,
1587520	1589360	is that the sense of the sentence
1589360	1591360	or the reference of the sentence?
1591360	1593120	Let us assume for the time being
1593120	1594720	that the sentence has a reference.
1594720	1597600	If we now replace one word of the sentence by another,
1597600	1598800	having the same reference,
1598800	1600160	but a different sense,
1600160	1601760	this can have no influence
1601760	1603440	upon the reference of the sentence.
1603440	1606240	Ah, so Frege has found a little test
1606240	1608240	to tell whether the proposition
1608240	1609680	or the thought or whatever
1609680	1611920	is the sense of the sentence or the reference.
1611920	1614480	He realizes that there are these terms,
1614480	1616160	Sean Carter and Jay-Z,
1616160	1618080	which have different senses,
1618080	1619200	but the same reference.
1619200	1621280	And so if you switch between the two,
1621280	1623920	if you swap out this name,
1624000	1624880	Sean Carter,
1624880	1626960	and you put in this name Jay-Z
1626960	1628080	into the same sentence,
1628080	1629840	that's the difference between three and four,
1629840	1631280	if you swap them out
1631280	1634240	because these two names have the same reference,
1635040	1637600	then switching between these two sentences
1637600	1640320	should not change the reference of the whole sentence,
1640320	1642800	but it should change at least sometimes
1642800	1644560	the sense of these sentences.
1644560	1646160	We're just switching out two terms.
1646160	1648560	We're going from a term with one sense
1648560	1649920	to a term with a different sense.
1649920	1651360	So these two sentences
1651360	1652960	should have different senses.
1652960	1656320	But because these two names have the same reference,
1656320	1659040	these two sentences should have the same reference.
1659040	1660880	Frege is trying to figure out
1660880	1662560	whether or not the proposition
1662560	1665280	or the thought expressed by a sentence
1665280	1666880	is the sense or the reference.
1666880	1668720	Well, there's this constraint.
1669360	1671040	These two sentences
1671040	1673680	will have different senses,
1673680	1675600	but the same reference.
1675600	1678000	Yet we can see that in such a case,
1678000	1679600	the thought changes.
1679600	1682480	Frege notices that these two sentences
1683120	1684800	express different propositions.
1684800	1686480	They express different thoughts.
1686480	1690320	So the thought cannot be the reference of a name
1690320	1692560	because the thought changes between these two,
1692560	1694080	but the reference can't change
1694080	1697600	because this name has the same reference as this name,
1697600	1699360	this has the same reference as this.
1699360	1701280	These are referentially the same.
1701280	1702880	So if something changes,
1702880	1703840	if the thought changes,
1703840	1705680	then the thought has to be the sense,
1705680	1706880	not the reference.
1706880	1708160	The thought, accordingly,
1708160	1710240	cannot be the reference of the sentence,
1710240	1712640	but must rather be considered as the sense.
1712640	1714160	Okay, so having figured out
1714160	1716160	what the sense of a whole sentence is,
1716160	1718080	it's the proposition expressed by that sentence,
1718080	1720160	the next question is, well, what's the reference?
1720160	1722560	What is the reference of a declarative sentence
1722560	1724240	like this or like this?
1724240	1725600	Sean Carter is rich.
1725600	1726560	Jay-Z is rich.
1726560	1728400	We know what these names refer to.
1728400	1730000	They refer to the guy.
1730000	1732080	What do the whole sentences refer to?
1732080	1733760	And once again, when figuring this out,
1733760	1736320	Frege is constrained by compositionality.
1736320	1738560	Whatever this thing the reference is,
1738560	1741920	it's gonna have to somehow be built up out of
1741920	1744320	the references of all the individual parts.
1744320	1746640	And this gives Frege an argument
1746640	1749760	for why the reference of a declarative sentence like this
1749760	1751840	is that sentence's truth value.
1752960	1755200	The truth value of a declarative sentence
1755200	1757520	is just whether or not the sentence is true or false.
1757520	1759280	There's two possible truth values.
1759840	1761680	True is one of them, false is the other.
1761680	1763680	You know, this sentence, Jay-Z is rich.
1763680	1764400	That's true.
1764400	1766080	Its truth value is true.
1766080	1770160	So Frege thinks that this whole sentence
1770240	1773520	refers to truth or the true.
1773520	1774880	That's what it refers to.
1774880	1776880	Okay, weird, but he has an argument
1776880	1779200	for why he thinks this has to be the case.
1779200	1781680	The reference of a whole declarative sentence
1781680	1783440	has to be composed up
1783440	1785840	out of the references of the individual parts.
1785840	1787920	Therefore, any change in the reference
1787920	1789600	of any of the individual parts
1789600	1793200	must result in a change in the reference of the whole sentence.
1793200	1795520	And whenever there is not a change
1795520	1797360	in the reference of the individual parts,
1797360	1799680	like when switching between three and four,
1799680	1801600	the references of all of these parts,
1801600	1804080	this name, this, this, this name, this, this,
1804080	1806320	the references of all this stays the same
1806320	1807760	when you switch from three to four.
1807760	1809920	So the reference of these whole sentences
1809920	1811200	has to stay the same.
1811200	1813280	Therefore, whatever the references
1813280	1815040	of these declarative sentences are,
1815040	1816240	they have to be the same.
1816240	1819280	These two sentences have to have the same reference
1819280	1821840	because all of their parts have the same reference
1821840	1824000	because Sean Carter and Jay-Z
1824000	1826400	are two different names with the same reference.
1826400	1829520	These two names are what's called co-referring terms.
1829600	1831040	Co-referring terms.
1831040	1832400	Co-referring terms.
1832400	1834160	They refer to the same thing.
1834160	1836880	And so this test that Frege has come up with is,
1836880	1840240	oh, well, if you swap out one term
1840240	1842560	for another term that's co-referring,
1842560	1845280	right, if you go from sentence three to sentence four,
1845280	1846800	if you do this swap,
1846800	1849120	you have to always preserve
1849120	1850720	the reference of the whole sentence.
1850720	1853040	So then the question for Frege is very simple.
1853040	1855280	What is something about these sentences
1855280	1857360	that always stays the same
1857360	1860080	whenever you swap out co-referring terms?
1860080	1862080	Whenever you go from a sentence like three
1862080	1863520	to a sentence like four,
1863520	1865760	what stays the same every time?
1865760	1867280	Well, it's not the thought.
1867280	1869120	It's not the cognitive value.
1869120	1870160	The thought changes.
1870160	1871760	That's the sense and that changes.
1871760	1873040	It's the truth value.
1873040	1876800	Whenever you swap in a different name for this guy,
1876800	1879440	the resulting sentence will always have
1879440	1882080	the same truth value as these two.
1883360	1884960	And there it is, hove.
1884960	1886000	Hove is rich.
1886000	1887200	That's true as well.
1887200	1889680	This is true, this is true, and this is true.
1889680	1891920	You're never gonna be able to get a sentence
1891920	1894560	that just switches in a co-referring term here
1894560	1896480	and all of a sudden that sentence is false
1896480	1898000	whereas all of these remain true.
1898000	1899120	You're never gonna get that
1899120	1901920	because the truth value always stays the same
1901920	1903920	when you swap in co-referring terms
1903920	1905360	and that is Frege's argument
1905360	1908160	for why the truth value of a declarative sentence
1908160	1910400	is the reference of that sentence.
1910400	1913360	And the same would hold if these sentences were false, right?
1913360	1916080	If instead of saying Sean Carter is rich,
1916080	1918800	this sentence said Sean Carter is enshrined
1918800	1921040	in the country music hall of fame,
1921040	1922720	well then three would be false
1922720	1925120	but then the same sentence where you swap in Jay-Z,
1925120	1926560	that would also be false.
1926560	1928080	Hove would also be false.
1928080	1931280	Any sentence that is false of Sean Carter
1931280	1934160	is also false of Jay-Z, is also false of Hove.
1934160	1937120	Swapping out these names with different senses
1937120	1940560	but the same reference changes the thought or proposition
1940560	1942640	but never changes the truth value.
1942640	1944240	At least that's true in the case
1944240	1945840	of simple sentences like this.
1945920	1948480	More complex sentences with like quotations
1948480	1949920	and things like that, this won't work
1949920	1951760	but we're not gonna worry about that now.
1951760	1954960	Let's just read Frege's argument for this conclusion.
1954960	1957280	If our supposition that the reference of a sentence
1957280	1959200	is its truth value is correct,
1959200	1960960	the latter, that is the truth value,
1960960	1962640	must remain unchanged
1962640	1964480	when a part of the sentence is replaced
1964480	1966800	by an expression having the same reference
1966800	1968400	and this is in fact the case.
1968400	1970720	Right, cool, that's just what we were saying.
1970720	1972000	Leibniz explains,
1972960	1980080	That's my best shot pronouncing the Latin.
1980080	1983120	It means equal are those which for each other
1983120	1985920	mutually substituted can be saving the truth.
1985920	1988400	And what that means in comprehensible English
1988400	1990000	is just that what it is to say
1990000	1991840	that two things are the same thing
1991840	1994080	is that every sentence that's true of one
1994080	1995040	is true of the other.
1995040	1997360	What else but the truth value could be found
1997360	1999840	that belongs quite generally to every sentence
1999840	2002000	concerned with the reference of its components
2002000	2004240	and remains unchanged by substitutions
2004240	2005200	of the kind in question.
2005200	2008320	Frege is asking what could it be that stays the same
2008320	2010400	when you keep doing this substituting
2010400	2011760	other than the truth value
2011760	2013520	and the implied answer to this question
2013520	2014880	though he doesn't say it in the paper,
2014880	2016320	the implied answer is nothing.
2016320	2017920	There's nothing other than the truth value
2017920	2019440	that fits this role
2019440	2022240	and therefore the truth value of a declarative sentence
2022240	2023600	has to be its reference.
2024480	2026720	Okay, those are all the major claims in the paper.
2026720	2028640	There's a whole bunch of other weird grammatical stuff
2028640	2029760	in the second half of the paper,
2029760	2031360	but no one ever talks about that
2031360	2033760	and I'm not assigning that to my students.
2033760	2035760	So this video is done.
