00:00.000 --> 00:08.320
Pickles. And you don't like pickles. And you say, pickles. Barf. Pickles barf is not something

00:08.320 --> 00:10.000
that can be literally true or false.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.880
Recording another one of these lecture videos.

00:24.880 --> 00:36.720
Ugh. Today we're talking about AJ Ayer and chapter 6 of his book. But let's talk about what I just said.

00:36.720 --> 00:47.760
That utterance. Can that be true or false? Literally. Can it literally be true that recording a lecture

00:47.760 --> 00:58.800
video? Ugh. No. It can't. That's not the kind of thing that can be true or false. I don't mean that

00:58.800 --> 01:06.240
that statement or that utterance isn't true. I mean that it can't be true. And I don't mean

01:06.240 --> 01:11.680
that it isn't false. I mean that it can't be false. This kind of utterance. This kind of

01:11.680 --> 01:20.640
linguistic expression when you say, ugh. That can't be true or false. Or you see some pickles.

01:20.640 --> 01:28.400
And you don't like pickles. And you say, pickles. Barf. Pickles barf is not something that can be

01:28.400 --> 01:36.640
literally true or false. Whereas by comparison, an ordinary assertion, something along the lines of

01:37.360 --> 01:45.280
it's raining can be true or false, right? It's raining is true when it's raining. And it's false

01:45.280 --> 01:52.880
when it's not raining. So there's a difference here. Some utterances have what's called a truth

01:52.880 --> 01:59.200
value. They can be true or false. And some utterances don't. They can't be true or false.

01:59.200 --> 02:06.960
These, these ones, this one in particular is just merely an expression of a sentiment. It's just

02:06.960 --> 02:13.360
merely expressing how I feel. I come in here and I say, recording another one of these lecture videos.

02:15.040 --> 02:22.800
That's just expressing my sentiment about having to record another one of these lecture videos.

02:22.800 --> 02:29.280
It expresses the sentiment of distaste or not wanting to record the lecture video.

02:30.000 --> 02:37.200
But it doesn't literally say, I don't want to record this lecture video. That would be something,

02:38.160 --> 02:41.680
that would be an assertion, that would be something that could be true or false, right?

02:41.680 --> 02:55.440
If I said, I don't want to record today, that's a full blown assertion. That can be true or false.

02:55.440 --> 03:01.360
And it's true if I don't want to record today. And it's false if I do want to record today,

03:01.360 --> 03:09.440
right? So these two utterances, they express the same feeling, but only one of them,

03:10.160 --> 03:18.560
as Airwood put it, asserts a proposition that can be true or false. This one makes a claim. It

03:18.560 --> 03:22.640
makes a claim about how the world is. In fact, it makes a claim about a very particular part of

03:22.640 --> 03:28.880
the world. It makes a claim about me and my mind, this part of the world, the part where my wants

03:28.880 --> 03:33.600
are. It says, I don't want to record today. That's just a statement about what I want.

03:34.320 --> 03:41.280
This is not a statement about anything. Okay, so why are we talking about this? Well,

03:42.400 --> 03:51.920
Air is going to make a claim about a particular type of talk or a particular type of discourse.

03:52.560 --> 04:02.560
Namely, he's going to say that moral talk or moral discourse is not the kind of thing that can be

04:02.560 --> 04:14.160
literally true or false. He's talking about moral talk. Notice something. Previously in this course,

04:14.160 --> 04:20.720
we've been talking about something very different. We haven't been talking about moral talk. We've

04:20.720 --> 04:29.920
been talking about morality. Previously, we've been talking about what's right and what's wrong,

04:30.560 --> 04:38.000
right? So if you read a philosopher who's arguing, for example, that you should give all of your

04:39.040 --> 04:46.560
expendable income, all of your extra income to charity, then that philosopher is making a claim

04:46.560 --> 04:52.880
about morality, a claim about what's right and what's wrong. It's different to make a claim

04:52.880 --> 05:03.680
about moral claims, a claim about moral language. Talking about this is a meta-ethical

05:03.680 --> 05:10.880
claim. We're making a move from talking about morality or ethics to talking about morality

05:10.880 --> 05:18.080
or ethics. Okay, so the key thing to take away is that everything we say about Air is about moral

05:18.080 --> 05:25.040
talk. There is a connection with morality, and I'll say what that connection is right now,

05:25.040 --> 05:32.080
but just know that all of the central claims that Air makes are about language. They're not about

05:32.080 --> 05:38.640
what's right and wrong. They're about our talking about what's right and wrong. Okay, so what is the

05:38.640 --> 05:45.760
connection between moral talk and morality for Air or for anyone who wants to say anything about the

05:45.760 --> 05:52.880
nature of moral talk and philosophy? The connection typically is this. Let's say that you wanted to

05:52.880 --> 06:00.960
be a moral skeptic. You wanted to say that there's no such thing as morality. Another way to put it

06:00.960 --> 06:07.680
is that you'd be a moral anti-realist. You'd say there really are no moral facts. Well, you still

06:07.680 --> 06:13.840
have to explain something that there obviously are. There obviously are lots of statements that

06:13.840 --> 06:22.560
people make in real life about morality. He says to Tyson, maybe, violence is wrong. That's a moral

06:22.560 --> 06:28.160
claim. That's moral talk. That's real. People really do say that. Now, the moral skeptic is going to

06:28.160 --> 06:35.200
want to say, well, there really is no underlying morality that would make a statement like this

06:35.200 --> 06:41.920
true. And so it looks on the surface like you've got two options. If you deny that there's any

06:41.920 --> 06:49.280
morality, but there obviously is moral talk, you can either say that all of this moral talk

06:50.480 --> 06:57.280
is false or misguided or confused and that therefore, presumably, we should stop. We should

06:57.280 --> 07:02.000
stop engaging in it. We should stop the moral talk. We should stop saying this sort of thing.

07:02.000 --> 07:08.880
And we say it a lot. So that's a huge revision of what we're doing is to say that all of this

07:08.880 --> 07:15.280
talk is mistaken and misguided or false and that we should let go of it. That's one option.

07:15.280 --> 07:20.480
But the other option for the moral skeptic who wants to get rid of morality is to say that

07:21.520 --> 07:31.680
all moral talk is not really truth apt. It's not true or false. So it's not false. It's doing

07:31.680 --> 07:36.880
something else altogether and so we can keep it. We can keep this moral talk, which is a big part

07:36.880 --> 07:42.480
of our lives, even though we're getting rid of morality itself. And so what we're going to get

07:42.480 --> 07:47.680
from Ayer today in the little snippet of the chapter that we read is an account of this kind

07:47.680 --> 07:53.600
of language that allows us to say that it's not true or false. It allows us to say that it's like...

07:55.280 --> 08:03.120
It's like... Right? It's a kind of talk that can't be true or false and that therefore,

08:03.120 --> 08:08.080
the fact that there isn't some underlying moral reality does not entail that we need

08:08.080 --> 08:15.360
to get rid of all this talk. We can keep it. So here's something that Ayer says. This actually

08:15.360 --> 08:21.040
wasn't in the part of the reading that we read for today, but it was on the reading guide that you

08:21.040 --> 08:30.240
read. Here's what he says. So he says, value statements are not in the literal sense significant,

08:30.240 --> 08:35.840
but are simply expressions of emotion, which can be neither true nor false. What does that mean?

08:36.480 --> 08:43.040
All right. Well, let's just go through some talk, some examples of talk. Here are some things

08:43.040 --> 08:53.280
that you can say. Ready? One thing that you could say is the door is shut. You could say that.

08:53.680 --> 09:01.840
That's an assertion. You're telling me something about the door, right? The door is shut. This

09:01.840 --> 09:07.840
sort of thing can be true or false. The door is shut. It's true if the door really is shut

09:07.840 --> 09:13.360
and it's false if the door is not shut. That's easy. Okay, but there's lots and lots and lots

09:13.360 --> 09:19.360
and lots of language that can't be true or false. One example is the one that I already gave at

09:19.360 --> 09:28.320
the beginning of video of the video, which is if you just say or something like that. That's some

09:28.320 --> 09:37.840
kind of exclamation or something like that or some kind of expression. And you can say that and it

09:37.840 --> 09:43.040
can be very meaningful. That can be a very meaningful thing to say, but it's not the kind of thing

09:43.040 --> 09:51.360
that can be true or false, right? True or false doesn't make sense. It's neither true nor false.

09:51.360 --> 09:57.120
It's just merely an expression of emotion, which can be neither true nor false. That's

09:58.320 --> 10:05.280
but it's not just sounds like that. Also, what if I said this is the door shut?

10:05.280 --> 10:15.200
We have a name for utterances like this. Questions. A question also can't be true or false, right?

10:16.240 --> 10:22.160
A question isn't making a claim about how the world is. It's not saying that the door is shut.

10:22.160 --> 10:28.480
It's not saying that the door is open. It's just asking what's up with the door, right? So a question

10:28.480 --> 10:33.760
can't be true or false, but it's still a perfectly meaningful thing to say. It's just not in the

10:33.760 --> 10:39.520
business of describing how the world is so it can't be true or false. Or here's another one,

10:39.520 --> 10:45.920
ready? Shut the door. What's that? I don't know. That's like an order or a command.

10:46.560 --> 10:55.760
An order or a command. Can that be true or false? No. No, that can't be true or false, right?

10:56.720 --> 11:02.160
It's not telling you that the door is shut. It's telling you to shut the door, right?

11:02.160 --> 11:09.680
All of these, these three at least, they are all talking about the door and its status,

11:09.680 --> 11:16.800
but one of them and only one of them is describing the status of the door, whether or not it's shut.

11:16.800 --> 11:23.520
The others are well asking about the status of the door and commanding someone to make the door

11:23.520 --> 11:30.960
have a certain status, being shut, right? So actually it looks like most language,

11:30.960 --> 11:36.880
most talk is not the sort of thing that can be true or false. Most of the things we say or that

11:36.880 --> 11:44.560
come out of our mouths or at least a lot of them are not assertions. All right, here's the thing.

11:45.680 --> 11:52.720
These statements, the kinds of value statements that we care about, we care about moral statements,

11:52.800 --> 11:57.200
we care about value statements, at least right now we do, right, in this course.

11:57.200 --> 12:05.440
These kinds of statements, the ones that look like this, violence is wrong, right?

12:06.400 --> 12:15.520
That statement, it sure looks like the door is shut. The door is shut. Violence is wrong.

12:16.400 --> 12:22.000
It looks like this is an assertion. It looks like lots of our moral talk is the kind of thing

12:22.000 --> 12:27.360
that can be either true or false. And therefore, if there is no such thing as right or wrong,

12:27.360 --> 12:31.520
of course, then all of these statements are going to be false because they're the kind of thing that

12:31.520 --> 12:40.880
could be false because they're assertions. But Ayer thinks, no, these aren't assertions. They

12:40.880 --> 12:48.800
look like assertions. This looks like this, but actually, really, literally, all it means is

12:48.800 --> 12:56.560
something like this. According to Ayer, this is the part to remember. Don't miss this. According

12:56.560 --> 13:08.960
to Ayer, violence is wrong is really like saying, boo, violence, boo, violence. That's not the kind

13:08.960 --> 13:14.000
of thing that can be true or false. That's not actually making an assertion about how the world

13:14.000 --> 13:20.080
is. Okay, so let's go back to the sentence. Value statements are not, in the literal sense,

13:20.080 --> 13:27.520
significant. That is, they're not assertions that can be true or false. They are simply

13:27.520 --> 13:34.480
expressions of emotion, which can neither be true or false, which can be neither true nor false.

13:35.040 --> 13:42.480
That's what Ayer is saying. Ayer is saying that value statements like this, they look like this,

13:42.480 --> 13:49.120
but they're really like that. Strictly speaking, they can't be true or false. Okay, so to further

13:49.120 --> 13:56.560
understand this point, think about the context where we say things like urgh or boo, right? Say

13:56.560 --> 14:02.640
that you're at a sporting event and half of the crowd in the stands are fans of one team and half

14:02.640 --> 14:07.200
of the crowd are fans of another team. And they introduce a player at the beginning, right? And

14:07.200 --> 14:14.960
they say, and now the point guard for the Golden State Warriors, Stefan Curry, right? And Curry comes

14:14.960 --> 14:24.080
out and half of the audience says boo, and the other half says yay. Imagine the announcer then

14:24.080 --> 14:34.240
comes along and says, well, who do you think is right? Boo or yay? No one's right. No one's wrong.

14:34.240 --> 14:41.600
No one is making a claim about how the world is. They're just merely expressing how they feel.

14:43.680 --> 14:51.120
Okay, notice one thing about these mere expressions and assertions.

14:52.240 --> 14:59.280
They can still be criticized, both of them actually. So compare, for example, the following two things.

14:59.360 --> 15:10.400
I could bump into you on the street and say sorry, right? Sorry. Or an alternative thing that I could

15:10.400 --> 15:18.880
say in the very similar or exactly the same situation is I could say I am filled with sorrow

15:19.200 --> 15:32.400
because I bumped into you. I could say that, right? This one is an assertion. This one is not,

15:33.040 --> 15:36.960
right? This can be true or false. I am filled with sorrow because I bumped into you.

15:37.680 --> 15:44.240
This is a description of how the world is. It's true if I really am filled with sorrow.

15:45.200 --> 15:51.120
And it's false if I'm not filled with sorrow. But just saying sorry, that can't be true or false.

15:51.120 --> 15:55.120
You bump into somebody on the street, they say sorry, you can't come back and say,

15:55.120 --> 16:03.120
false. I don't think you are filled with sorrow. What? You can criticize them for being insincere.

16:03.680 --> 16:09.120
You can say that didn't sound sincere. I don't think you're really sorry, right? If they bump into

16:09.680 --> 16:18.480
you in the street and they say sorry, sorry like that, that's insincere. They're not really sorry.

16:19.120 --> 16:29.040
Sorry is capable of being insincere because it expresses a sentiment or a feeling.

16:29.760 --> 16:38.640
It expresses a feeling and therefore it can be sincere or insincere,

16:39.520 --> 16:45.600
you know, write it like that. Sincere or insincere, right? It can be sincere or insincere because

16:45.600 --> 16:51.040
it expresses a sentiment and if you really have that sentiment, then it's sincere to say you're

16:51.040 --> 16:55.920
sorry. But if you really don't have that sentiment, if you're not filled with sorrow, if you don't

16:55.920 --> 17:04.000
have regret, then it's insincere. This can be insincere too, right? An assertion, this is an

17:04.000 --> 17:09.200
assertion. It's an assertion about how the world is. It just says that the world, a very little bit

17:09.200 --> 17:16.080
of the world, the part right here is a certain way. It says I am filled with sorrow. I feel lots

17:16.080 --> 17:22.560
of sorrow. So this is an assertion but it also expresses a sentiment. It expresses basically

17:22.560 --> 17:28.960
the same sentiment maybe and because it expresses that sentiment, it can also be sincere or insincere,

17:30.160 --> 17:38.000
right? Just in the way sorrow can. But the assertion does a second thing. The other thing that it does

17:38.800 --> 17:50.960
is that it, well, it puts forward a claim and it puts that forward, it puts forward that claim

17:51.040 --> 17:58.800
as if it is true. It says of this, of this claim, this is the way the world really is,

17:58.800 --> 18:05.360
this claim is true. I am filled with sorrow. It describes the world. Because of this,

18:05.360 --> 18:11.840
it can be true or false, that assertion, right? So notice that the assertion is doing two things

18:12.560 --> 18:18.880
and the mere expression of sorrow or sympathy is just doing one thing, right?

18:19.760 --> 18:26.240
Ayer is able, because of these facts, Ayer is able to say when he translates violence is wrong

18:26.240 --> 18:32.320
to boo violence, he's able to say that you're still able to criticize this kind of claim.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.560
We still can criticize these claims. We criticize them as sincere or insincere.

18:37.360 --> 18:42.160
We just can't strictly speaking criticize them as true or false.

18:45.120 --> 18:50.000
Okay, so in a minute we're going to talk about an alternative theory, a different theory,

18:50.000 --> 18:56.080
a theory other than Ayer's own theory that's also about moral talk. But let's just reiterate

18:56.080 --> 19:02.160
really quick. This is Ayer's claim. His claim is that value statements like violence is wrong,

19:02.160 --> 19:06.720
the kind of statement that he might have made to Mike Tyson during that encounter that we read

19:06.720 --> 19:13.680
about, right? That kind of claim really just means boo violence. It's really not an assertion,

19:13.680 --> 19:18.800
even though it looks like an assertion. Value statements are not in the literal sense significant,

19:18.800 --> 19:24.800
but are simply expressions of emotion which can be neither true nor false. Okay,

19:24.800 --> 19:29.760
he's going to now talk about an alternative theory. Let's get to that.

19:30.240 --> 19:40.400
Remember that we are talking about language. We're talking about moral language or moral talk,

19:41.040 --> 19:47.040
right? And our running example is this claim that Ayer might have made to Tyson or something like

19:47.040 --> 19:59.840
that, the claim violence is wrong. Ayer says that what this claim really means is something like

20:02.320 --> 20:14.000
boo violence. That's Ayer. All right, can you see me? Is this line in my face? It doesn't matter.

20:14.880 --> 20:20.720
Violence is wrong really means boo violence. But there's an alternative theory. The name for that

20:20.720 --> 20:30.400
theory that Ayer uses is the orthodox subjective theory. We're just going to call it subjectivism.

20:33.200 --> 20:38.960
This is an alternative theory of what this phrase means. And the alternative theory just says

20:38.960 --> 20:47.200
that this phrase means something like I dislike violence.

20:49.920 --> 20:58.240
That's the subjectivist claim. Okay, so notice that these are very different, right? Whoops.

21:00.880 --> 21:07.040
Ayer is claiming that this looks like an assertion, but it's no assertion at all. It's a mere

21:07.040 --> 21:12.320
expression. It can't be true or false. The subjectivist is claiming that this assertion

21:12.320 --> 21:20.720
is an assertion. It's just a different assertion, right? Violence is wrong looks like it's a claim

21:20.720 --> 21:26.960
about violence. It looks like it's just saying violence is wrong. Really, according to the

21:26.960 --> 21:32.000
subjectivist, this is an alternative to Ayer's approach that he brings up and then attacks,

21:32.560 --> 21:37.840
really, according to the subjectivist, this is not a claim about violence. It's a claim about the

21:37.840 --> 21:44.000
speaker. It's a claim about me when I'm talking. Let's back up for a second. We'll explain this

21:44.000 --> 21:50.480
claim in a sec. But first, let's just see that these aren't the only two alternatives. This is one

21:50.480 --> 21:55.600
translation of violence is wrong. This is another translation of violence is wrong. But then there's

21:55.600 --> 22:03.920
the just sort of ordinary naive translation, right? The naive theory, the theory that you would

22:03.920 --> 22:08.000
have if you weren't thinking hard about these things, and it might be the right theory, by the way.

22:08.720 --> 22:13.840
The naive theory about statements like violence is wrong is just that it means

22:15.680 --> 22:23.680
violence is wrong. That's what it means. It's an assertion. It asserts that violence has a

22:23.680 --> 22:30.240
certain property and the property is wrongness, right? If you just take the statement, a regular

22:30.240 --> 22:40.000
ordinary statement like grass is green, if you take an ordinary statement like that,

22:40.000 --> 22:46.160
well, what does that really mean? What are you talking about? It really means that grass is green.

22:46.160 --> 22:51.680
That's what it means. It's an assertion. It's true if grass is green. It's false if grass is any other

22:51.680 --> 22:58.560
color. That's what grass is green means. Grass is green means grass is green. It says that grass

22:58.560 --> 23:03.840
has a certain property of being green. That's it. You might think the same thing about violence

23:03.840 --> 23:10.160
is wrong. That's the naive view. Violence is wrong just means violence is wrong. It has the feature

23:10.160 --> 23:17.600
of being wrong. That's it. So both Ayer's theory and subjectivism are departing from the natural

23:17.600 --> 23:25.280
way of interpreting this kind of language, this moral talk. Okay, but put that aside for a minute.

23:25.280 --> 23:33.760
Let's understand these two alternative theories, Ayer's and subjectivism. Subjectivism means or

23:33.760 --> 23:43.360
subjectivism claims rather that moral talk really consists of claims about the individual who's

23:43.360 --> 23:52.640
speaking at the time. So when I say that violence is wrong, my statement can be true or false

23:52.640 --> 24:00.720
according to subjectivism. It can be true or false, but its truth or falsity depends not on the nature

24:00.720 --> 24:07.040
of violence and whether it's really wrong. It depends just on the nature of me, the speaker,

24:07.040 --> 24:13.600
and whether I really dislike it or something like that, whether I have some negative sentiment

24:13.600 --> 24:18.640
towards it. That's what really determines whether the statement is true or false. Whereas on Ayer's

24:18.640 --> 24:26.400
view, the statement can't be true or false at all. Ayer brings up this theory, subjectivism,

24:26.400 --> 24:33.520
for three reasons. The first reason is to help clarify what his own view is. Once you see that

24:33.600 --> 24:41.600
there's an alternative theory about what moral statements mean that makes them into assertions,

24:41.600 --> 24:45.440
just different assertions than you might have thought they were, then you realize, oh whoa,

24:45.440 --> 24:49.840
his theory is rather radical. It says that they are not assertions at all. They're not

24:49.840 --> 24:54.640
claims that can be true or false at all. Okay, so you get a clearer sense of what his view is.

24:54.640 --> 24:59.920
His view is the violence view. You get a clearer sense of what his view is by just bringing this

24:59.920 --> 25:05.120
view up and saying, my view is not that. Okay, so that's the first reason he brings up subjectivism.

25:05.120 --> 25:09.600
The second reason he brings up subjectivism is because subjectivism is obviously wrong,

25:09.600 --> 25:15.680
and he can attack it, and that shows that his theory has a certain advantage. It doesn't fall

25:15.680 --> 25:22.000
prey to the kind of attack or mistake that destroys subjectivism. He only talks about this for like

25:22.000 --> 25:28.160
two sentences in the part that we read. They come and go really fast, but basically the objection

25:28.160 --> 25:34.160
that kills off subjectivism but that doesn't hurt Ayer's own theory is this. Violence is wrong

25:34.960 --> 25:44.320
or any moral claim. It seems like if it's true, it's not true because of something about the

25:44.320 --> 25:51.120
speaker, right? Imagine that a philosopher comes to talk to you and they make some moral claim.

25:51.120 --> 26:00.640
They say, spending money on luxuries is evil. You cannot do it. It's wrong. Buying a cup of coffee

26:00.640 --> 26:06.240
made at a coffee shop rather than just making the coffee yourself at home and donating the extra money

26:06.240 --> 26:12.000
to famine relief is wrong. Those are all moral claims. They make moral claims like that and maybe

26:12.000 --> 26:19.440
you start arguing with them and you say, oh no, you know, I live in a capitalist society and blah,

26:20.160 --> 26:24.160
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The philosopher can't just come back and say, no, no, no, no,

26:24.160 --> 26:29.360
you don't understand. It's wrong. Let me prove it to you. And then they cut open their skull

26:29.360 --> 26:35.280
and rip it open and put a brain scanner on them. And then the brain scanner reads off on a screen

26:35.280 --> 26:39.600
and there on the screen it says, it shows all the things that they think and right there on the

26:39.600 --> 26:52.400
screen it says, this guy dislikes coffee. That's what it said on the screen of the brain scanner

26:52.400 --> 26:56.800
or it says something like, this guy dislikes spending money on coffee instead of donating

26:56.800 --> 27:03.200
that money to famine relief. Does that, does that evidence, that brain scan evidence,

27:03.200 --> 27:09.840
does that prove that the moral statement, you know, coffee is evil?

27:11.600 --> 27:20.000
Does that prove that this statement is true? This brain scan? Brain scan? No, no it doesn't. No one

27:20.000 --> 27:25.120
takes that seriously. That's not the kind of evidence that you'd ever try to give for a moral

27:25.120 --> 27:32.320
statement like this. It's just obvious. We take this for granted in all of our moral discourse.

27:32.320 --> 27:39.840
It's just obvious that moral statements like this are not statements about the speaker. If I

27:39.840 --> 27:45.920
make a statement about me, we all know that it's a statement about me and we talk as if it's a

27:45.920 --> 27:53.360
statement about me. I say, I'm exhausted and someone might say, oh, is it because you haven't

27:53.360 --> 28:00.640
gotten enough sleep? It's all about me, right? Whereas if I say violence is wrong, no one says,

28:00.720 --> 28:06.320
oh, is it because you're like a curmudgeonly person and you dislike a lot of stuff? Is that why

28:06.320 --> 28:11.600
violence is wrong? No, that's not why violence is wrong. That might be why I think it's wrong,

28:11.600 --> 28:17.040
but my thinking that it's wrong or my disliking it, that's not the same as it's being wrong.

28:17.040 --> 28:24.320
If this is true, it sure isn't true just because I dislike violence. This theory,

28:24.320 --> 28:29.760
subjectivism, this theory is no good. It makes this crazy claim that these statements are true

28:29.760 --> 28:35.360
or false based on what the speaker is thinking or what the speaker feels, and that's just not

28:35.360 --> 28:42.560
how anyone thinks about morality. So that is the second reason why air brings up subjectivism,

28:42.560 --> 28:48.880
is to argue against it in that way. And it shows that air's view doesn't have that problem. I mean,

28:48.880 --> 28:55.600
air's view is in a way more radical. It says that moral statements don't even have truth values,

28:55.600 --> 29:02.400
but that radicalness gives it the advantage of not having to say that the truth value of a

29:02.400 --> 29:08.080
moral statement depends on the speaker of the statement or the mind of the speaker of that

29:08.080 --> 29:16.160
moral statement. Okay, so he argues against subjectivism in that way, but then the third reason,

29:16.160 --> 29:23.760
the third reason that air brings up subjectivism is to give an objection to subjectivism,

29:23.760 --> 29:30.240
raise an objection that comes from the philosopher G.E. Moore. Moore's objection.

29:32.400 --> 29:37.120
So this objection is not like the one that we just saw towards subjectivism,

29:37.120 --> 29:42.720
where it only applies to subjectivism and doesn't also apply to air's view. This objection, if it

29:42.720 --> 29:50.160
works, also is a problem for air's own view. So we're going to talk about that objection,

29:50.160 --> 29:54.080
and then we're going to get air's response to it. This all happens in like the four pages that we

29:54.080 --> 29:59.680
read. So what is Moore's objection? This happens, by the way, in the reading that we're using

30:00.720 --> 30:07.360
on page 110. We get an explanation of Moore's objection, and then also on 110 going on to 111,

30:07.360 --> 30:12.800
we get air's response. So if you follow and understand everything I'm saying about Moore's

30:12.800 --> 30:18.400
objection and air's response, but you didn't pick it up in the reading, go back to those pages,

30:18.400 --> 30:24.880
reread those pages to get Moore's objection and air's response. Okay, well, what is Moore's objection?

30:25.440 --> 30:29.200
The objection is this. Fundamentally, Moore is claiming that

30:32.160 --> 30:38.880
we have genuine moral disagreements. We have genuine moral debates. We productively argue with one

30:38.880 --> 30:46.240
another about morality, and when we do this, we literally contradict one another. When we have

30:46.240 --> 30:51.600
moral debates or moral discussions, we very frequently have situations where one person

30:51.600 --> 30:58.480
says something, and the other person says, no, that's not the case. That's false, right? So one

30:58.480 --> 31:13.840
person says abortion is wrong, and another person says abortion is permissible. It's not wrong.

31:14.800 --> 31:22.320
It might not be great, but it's not something that's always wrong. These two folks are disagreeing

31:22.320 --> 31:25.600
with one another. They are contradicting one another. They cannot both be right.

31:27.840 --> 31:35.440
If air's view is true, then they're not really contradicting one another, because really one of

31:35.520 --> 31:48.960
them is just saying, boo, abortion. That's the first one. The other one is saying, okay, abortion.

31:51.520 --> 31:55.360
They're not contradicting one each other, one another. If one person says boo, and the other

31:55.360 --> 32:00.560
person says yay, and they're screaming back and forth at each other from across a stadium

32:00.560 --> 32:06.240
at a sporting event, they're not arguing. Now, there's a sense in which there is a tension

32:06.240 --> 32:10.720
between the sentiments that they are expressing. One of them feels a certain way, and the other

32:10.720 --> 32:15.920
person feels a different way, and an individual person can't coherently feel both ways at the

32:15.920 --> 32:23.200
same time. They can't, as it were, well, be in favor of something and be against it at the same time,

32:23.200 --> 32:28.160
right? But that doesn't mean that the things that they've said contradict one another. They're not

32:28.160 --> 32:33.920
productively disagreeing. Here's an example that goes back a little bit to subjectivism. Say that

32:33.920 --> 32:39.840
I'm sitting at a table eating pickled tomatoes, and someone comes up to me and says, I don't like

32:39.840 --> 32:46.320
pickled tomatoes. And I say, I do like pickled tomatoes. And they say, I don't like pickled

32:46.320 --> 32:55.280
tomatoes. And I say, but I like them. We don't disagree with one another. We're just screaming

32:55.280 --> 33:00.480
back and forth, and I'm talking about me, and this other person is talking about themselves.

33:01.440 --> 33:06.160
And so we don't really disagree. There's a kind of confusion. We are, as it were, talking past

33:06.160 --> 33:12.240
one another. If you're a subjectivist about moral talk, then you have to say that disagreements,

33:12.240 --> 33:17.680
like this one, are really just two people shouting back and forth at each other when they're really

33:17.680 --> 33:21.120
each talking about different things. One of them is talking about themselves, and the other one

33:21.120 --> 33:26.400
is talking about themselves. And so too with air. Moral disagreements like this, it looks like

33:26.400 --> 33:29.920
these people are arguing with one another, but they're not really arguing with one another.

33:29.920 --> 33:35.200
One is just yelling boo, and one is just yelling yay. And here's Moore's claim.

33:36.480 --> 33:45.120
Moral disagreements are real. They're genuine. They exist. And so any theory, Moore thinks,

33:45.120 --> 33:49.280
that gets the results that there aren't moral disagreements, that theory is no good.

33:49.280 --> 33:55.360
That's Moore's objection. Okay. What's air's response to Moore's objection?

33:56.880 --> 34:04.880
All right. Air does something that in philosophy, we call biting the bullet.

34:06.400 --> 34:11.040
You bite a bullet in real life. I mean, you probably hopefully will never bite a bullet.

34:11.040 --> 34:14.960
You bite a bullet in real life when you have to do something really painful, like get surgery

34:14.960 --> 34:19.520
without anesthesia. And you're supposed to bite the bullet in order to bear the pain.

34:20.560 --> 34:24.960
So air is, as it were, going to take on something that's a little bit painful,

34:24.960 --> 34:28.800
but he's going to do it to save his theory, which he thinks has many other advantages.

34:29.840 --> 34:36.640
He just bites the bullet and accepts that we don't have genuine moral disagreements.

34:36.640 --> 34:46.400
He denies that we have genuine moral disagreements. He says that it looks like we have genuine moral

34:46.400 --> 34:52.480
disagreements, but we really don't. How can he possibly say that? It really seems like we have

34:52.480 --> 35:01.680
moral disagreements. Here's a little bit of an argument for air's view that defends him from

35:01.760 --> 35:10.720
Moore's objection. Say that we're talking about public policy, drug policy, right? Here's a moral

35:10.720 --> 35:16.880
claim. Marijuana, that's just how I'm going to write marijuana because I don't know how to spell it,

35:17.440 --> 35:27.200
marijuana should be legal. Let's say you think that. Well, if you do think that you're using

35:27.200 --> 35:31.280
moral language, you're making a moral claim, you're talking about what should be the case.

35:31.280 --> 35:40.080
You're talking about how our society ought to be arranged. What is the just way to arrange our

35:40.080 --> 35:46.480
legal system and our laws? This is a moral statement if there ever was one, right? Marijuana should

35:46.480 --> 35:52.960
be legal. Okay, say you were arguing for that claim or you were arguing against it. What might you

35:52.960 --> 36:00.160
say? Think about it. Actually pause the video right now and make up an argument either for the

36:00.160 --> 36:06.880
claim that marijuana should be legal or that it shouldn't. You didn't pause the video. No, you

36:06.880 --> 36:09.840
don't really pause it. You're not actually going to think of something. You're just going to keep

36:09.840 --> 36:14.240
on watching. Okay, well, listen. Here's what you could have said. Here's what you probably would

36:14.240 --> 36:21.200
have said. You might have said something like this. Well, marijuana should be legal because

36:21.200 --> 36:29.760
marijuana maybe stops seizures. Oh, I don't know how to spell seizures, but something like that.

36:29.760 --> 36:36.320
Okay, marijuana stops seizures. You might argue in favor of marijuana legalization by making that

36:36.320 --> 36:46.240
point. Or if you're an opponent of a marijuana legalization, you might say marijuana impairs

36:46.240 --> 36:57.200
judgment impairs judgment. And that in turn causes car crashes, which cause death. We could go back

36:57.200 --> 37:04.080
and forth about all of this sort of stuff. But did you notice something? This was a moral statement,

37:04.960 --> 37:09.360
a normative statement about a statement about how things should be. But then when we started to

37:09.360 --> 37:15.040
actually have this debate or started to have this discussion, all of the claims that we started

37:15.040 --> 37:26.720
hearing were factual claims. They were factual claims. Factual. These ones are factual. This one

37:27.520 --> 37:34.560
is moral or normative in at least some sense. But these are not claims about how things should be.

37:34.560 --> 37:40.400
The fact that marijuana stops seizures, if it does, in some cases, is not a fact about how

37:40.880 --> 37:46.160
things should be. It's a fact about how things are. It just is true that this chemical interacts with

37:46.160 --> 37:52.240
this other chemical in this certain way. That's it. It's a factual claim. It's not a moral claim.

37:52.240 --> 37:58.240
It's a factual claim. Same thing for marijuana causes impairment, which in turn causes car crashes

37:58.240 --> 38:03.040
if you're driving. That's a factual claim. That's a claim about chemicals. Chemicals interacting

38:03.040 --> 38:08.400
with other chemicals, chemicals in the marijuana, chemicals in your brain, nerves leading to your

38:08.400 --> 38:17.440
hands and feet when you're driving. These are all factual claims. Ayer thinks this. He thinks that

38:17.440 --> 38:25.680
when we are having disagreements that are genuine, they're not really moral. And when we're having

38:25.680 --> 38:33.680
disagreements that are really moral, they're not really genuine. We can have a genuine disagreement

38:34.320 --> 38:40.320
about, well, whether marijuana should be legal. But that's only because we're really at the

38:40.320 --> 38:48.240
underlying level disagreeing about some factual claim, whether or not marijuana stops seizures

38:48.240 --> 38:52.320
or whether or not marijuana has some other effects or something like that. We're just

38:52.320 --> 38:58.800
disagreeing about factual things. We're able to have that disagreement because under the surface,

38:59.360 --> 39:06.320
there is actually some degree of moral agreement. We agree about something. Namely, we agree,

39:06.880 --> 39:15.920
well, we agree about something moral. We agree that stopping seizures, I still don't know how to

39:15.920 --> 39:23.840
spell seizures, is good. That's a moral claim too. We agree about this. And it's only because we have

39:23.920 --> 39:29.040
this kind of agreement. We have the same sentiments here that we're able to have this kind of

39:29.040 --> 39:35.280
disagreement. Moore's claim is that we can have our sentiments aligned on certain things, on

39:35.280 --> 39:40.160
certain matters. We can have the same sentiments. We would express them in the same thing. And then

39:40.160 --> 39:46.960
when we get to the level of disagreement, really, we are disagreeing about factual things because

39:46.960 --> 39:54.880
there's some underlying moral convergence. That's his response to Moore's objection, is that we don't

39:54.880 --> 40:01.120
have genuine moral disagreements, or at least not nearly as often as we think we do, what we have

40:01.120 --> 40:09.920
are moral agreements and genuine non-moral disagreements. Now, we are able to explain what

40:09.920 --> 40:15.680
I think is the most difficult sentence in the reading. So right now, I'm going to explain to

40:15.680 --> 40:22.480
you, given everything I just said, what this very difficult sentence said. So let me get the sentence.

40:25.520 --> 40:32.000
Here's the sentence. It happens on the bottom of page 111. And I'm going to write it up now,

40:32.000 --> 40:36.720
and then we're going to use everything that we just said, our understanding of Aire's view,

40:36.720 --> 40:41.840
our understanding of subjectivism, and Moore's objection to subjectivism, and then Aire's response

40:41.840 --> 40:48.000
to Moore's objection. We're going to use all of that to understand what this sentence says. Okay, here it is.

40:51.440 --> 40:59.440
Let's go through it real slow. If our opponent concurs with us in expressing moral disapproval

40:59.440 --> 41:07.040
of all actions of a given type T, then we may get him to condemn a particular action A by bringing

41:07.040 --> 41:14.320
forward arguments to show that A is of type T. Okay, what's going on? The background is that Moore

41:14.320 --> 41:22.080
is talking about how actual moral disagreements work, how we actually try to persuade one another

41:22.720 --> 41:30.880
to change our minds about moral matters. Suppose you wanted to convince some people

41:30.880 --> 41:37.200
that marijuana should be illegal. You were Jeff Sessions or something like that. You want to convince

41:37.200 --> 41:51.120
folks that marijuana, I really hope that's how you spell it, right, should be illegal. Okay,

41:52.640 --> 41:58.640
you want to convince someone of that fact. How do you go about doing it? Well, we just heard

41:59.200 --> 42:05.440
that Aire's response to Moore involved him saying that underneath this disagreement,

42:05.440 --> 42:09.840
where one person thinks that it should be illegal, and the other person thinks it's fine, it should

42:09.840 --> 42:16.240
be legal, right, underneath this disagreement are factual disagreements, and then underneath those

42:16.240 --> 42:25.120
factual disagreements are moral agreements, right. So here's something, here's something that, well,

42:25.120 --> 42:29.920
if you're Jeff Sessions and you're trying to argue for this, you know that your opponent is going to

42:29.920 --> 42:38.080
agree with you about, okay. They're going to agree with you that we're talking about behavior that

42:38.080 --> 42:43.440
leads to murder. Everyone is going to agree that that's bad. They're going to have the same negative

42:43.440 --> 42:52.480
sentiments towards that, right. Okay, everyone agrees that this is bad. Let's call this type of

42:52.480 --> 43:05.760
behavior, behavior type T. Behavior type T is any behavior that leads to murder. Okay, and then

43:05.760 --> 43:12.960
let's talk about some more specific type of behavior, behavior type A, and this will be

43:12.960 --> 43:18.800
smoking marijuana. Let's say you were Jeff Sessions, you thought that marijuana was terrible,

43:18.800 --> 43:23.600
it should be illegal. You know that everyone agrees with you that if something leads to murder,

43:24.240 --> 43:31.520
then it should be illegal too. So you just have to, well, make a factual claim. You make the

43:31.520 --> 43:41.040
following factual claim that this type of behavior, smoking marijuana, is really just some of this

43:41.040 --> 43:47.680
type of behavior. It's a subset. Smoking marijuana is one type of behavior that leads to murder,

43:47.680 --> 43:52.560
and you do this with science or made up science if you don't have real science to back you up,

43:52.560 --> 43:59.040
right, or whatever you're going to use, right. This is a factual claim. The factual claim is that

43:59.600 --> 44:05.760
smoking marijuana is a type of behavior that leads to murder. That's a factual claim.

44:06.800 --> 44:14.800
Ayer is saying that this sort of thing is what goes on when we have moral disagreements, right,

44:14.800 --> 44:20.960
and that his theory is perfectly able to explain this. All right, let's go back to the quote.

44:20.960 --> 44:28.640
Let's read it again. If our opponent concurs with us, so if our opponent agrees with us, if we all

44:28.640 --> 44:36.480
agree, what do we agree about? We agree in expressing moral disapproval of all actions of a given type

44:36.560 --> 44:48.080
T. So we all disapprove of anything that leads to murder, right? Okay, so we all agree that this

44:48.080 --> 44:57.520
is to be disapproved of, any action of a given type T. Then we may get him our opponent, okay,

44:58.240 --> 45:04.800
we may get our opponent to condemn a particular action A, right, so we want to condemn A. You're

45:04.800 --> 45:12.960
Jeff Sessions, you want to condemn A, right? We may get him to condemn, we may get our opponent

45:12.960 --> 45:22.560
to condemn this by bringing forward arguments to show that A is of type T, to show that this

45:22.560 --> 45:27.760
is really of this type, that this is the claim. Now, I'm not saying it's true and I'm not saying

45:27.760 --> 45:33.120
it's false, I'm just saying that according to Ayer, this is the kind of moral argument that we

45:33.120 --> 45:40.880
make. We say that this type of action is really of this type of action and we already agree in

45:40.880 --> 45:48.960
condemning this type of action and so by making this factual claim, it's a factual claim to say

45:48.960 --> 45:54.480
that smoking marijuana leads to murder, that's just a factual claim, that's not a moral claim,

45:54.480 --> 46:00.400
right? This kind of factual claim is the kind of claim that we actually disagree about and that

46:00.400 --> 46:06.000
that's what's really at the heart of moral disagreements. One last thing before we're done.

46:08.640 --> 46:15.360
We've said all these things about Ayer's theory and Ayer's theory one more time is a theory of

46:15.360 --> 46:26.080
moral talk or moral language, not of morality itself. Why again do we care about moral talk

46:26.080 --> 46:33.920
or moral language? The answer, I've already said this but it's worth repeating, is that if you want

46:33.920 --> 46:43.360
to be a moral skeptic, if you want to deny that there really is any such thing as morality,

46:44.240 --> 46:49.680
then you're going to need to explain all of the moral talk. Are you going to say that it's all

46:49.680 --> 46:56.000
false? Ayer is able to say if he's right about moral talk, which he might not be, but if he's

46:56.000 --> 47:00.960
right about it then he's able to say that, well, morality is not real but we don't have to throw

47:00.960 --> 47:06.480
out all of our moral discourse and all of our moral language, that's fine. We disagree about

47:06.480 --> 47:14.800
factual matters that are underlying our moral debates and when we do express moral sentiments,

47:14.800 --> 47:21.360
we do so in a way that doesn't also assert that things are true. So we don't have to throw out

47:21.360 --> 47:26.080
all of our moral talk because it's all false, just because we're moral skeptics, because moral

47:26.080 --> 47:30.320
talk was never the kind of thing that was true or false in the first place.
