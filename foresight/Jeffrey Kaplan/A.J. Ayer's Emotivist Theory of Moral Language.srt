1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
Pickles. And you don't like pickles. And you say, pickles. Barf. Pickles barf is not something

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,000
that can be literally true or false.

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,880
Recording another one of these lecture videos.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:36,720
Ugh. Today we're talking about AJ Ayer and chapter 6 of his book. But let's talk about what I just said.

5
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:47,760
That utterance. Can that be true or false? Literally. Can it literally be true that recording a lecture

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:58,800
video? Ugh. No. It can't. That's not the kind of thing that can be true or false. I don't mean that

7
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,240
that statement or that utterance isn't true. I mean that it can't be true. And I don't mean

8
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,680
that it isn't false. I mean that it can't be false. This kind of utterance. This kind of

9
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:20,640
linguistic expression when you say, ugh. That can't be true or false. Or you see some pickles.

10
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,400
And you don't like pickles. And you say, pickles. Barf. Pickles barf is not something that can be

11
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:36,640
literally true or false. Whereas by comparison, an ordinary assertion, something along the lines of

12
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:45,280
it's raining can be true or false, right? It's raining is true when it's raining. And it's false

13
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:52,880
when it's not raining. So there's a difference here. Some utterances have what's called a truth

14
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,200
value. They can be true or false. And some utterances don't. They can't be true or false.

15
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,960
These, these ones, this one in particular is just merely an expression of a sentiment. It's just

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,360
merely expressing how I feel. I come in here and I say, recording another one of these lecture videos.

17
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,800
That's just expressing my sentiment about having to record another one of these lecture videos.

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,280
It expresses the sentiment of distaste or not wanting to record the lecture video.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,200
But it doesn't literally say, I don't want to record this lecture video. That would be something,

20
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,680
that would be an assertion, that would be something that could be true or false, right?

21
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:55,440
If I said, I don't want to record today, that's a full blown assertion. That can be true or false.

22
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,360
And it's true if I don't want to record today. And it's false if I do want to record today,

23
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:09,440
right? So these two utterances, they express the same feeling, but only one of them,

24
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:18,560
as Airwood put it, asserts a proposition that can be true or false. This one makes a claim. It

25
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
makes a claim about how the world is. In fact, it makes a claim about a very particular part of

26
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,880
the world. It makes a claim about me and my mind, this part of the world, the part where my wants

27
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,600
are. It says, I don't want to record today. That's just a statement about what I want.

28
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:41,280
This is not a statement about anything. Okay, so why are we talking about this? Well,

29
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:51,920
Air is going to make a claim about a particular type of talk or a particular type of discourse.

30
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Namely, he's going to say that moral talk or moral discourse is not the kind of thing that can be

31
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:14,160
literally true or false. He's talking about moral talk. Notice something. Previously in this course,

32
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:20,720
we've been talking about something very different. We haven't been talking about moral talk. We've

33
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:29,920
been talking about morality. Previously, we've been talking about what's right and what's wrong,

34
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,000
right? So if you read a philosopher who's arguing, for example, that you should give all of your

35
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:46,560
expendable income, all of your extra income to charity, then that philosopher is making a claim

36
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,880
about morality, a claim about what's right and what's wrong. It's different to make a claim

37
00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:03,680
about moral claims, a claim about moral language. Talking about this is a meta-ethical

38
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,880
claim. We're making a move from talking about morality or ethics to talking about morality

39
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,080
or ethics. Okay, so the key thing to take away is that everything we say about Air is about moral

40
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,040
talk. There is a connection with morality, and I'll say what that connection is right now,

41
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:32,080
but just know that all of the central claims that Air makes are about language. They're not about

42
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,640
what's right and wrong. They're about our talking about what's right and wrong. Okay, so what is the

43
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:45,760
connection between moral talk and morality for Air or for anyone who wants to say anything about the

44
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:52,880
nature of moral talk and philosophy? The connection typically is this. Let's say that you wanted to

45
00:05:52,880 --> 00:06:00,960
be a moral skeptic. You wanted to say that there's no such thing as morality. Another way to put it

46
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,680
is that you'd be a moral anti-realist. You'd say there really are no moral facts. Well, you still

47
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,840
have to explain something that there obviously are. There obviously are lots of statements that

48
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:22,560
people make in real life about morality. He says to Tyson, maybe, violence is wrong. That's a moral

49
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,160
claim. That's moral talk. That's real. People really do say that. Now, the moral skeptic is going to

50
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:35,200
want to say, well, there really is no underlying morality that would make a statement like this

51
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:41,920
true. And so it looks on the surface like you've got two options. If you deny that there's any

52
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:49,280
morality, but there obviously is moral talk, you can either say that all of this moral talk

53
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,280
is false or misguided or confused and that therefore, presumably, we should stop. We should

54
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,000
stop engaging in it. We should stop the moral talk. We should stop saying this sort of thing.

55
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,880
And we say it a lot. So that's a huge revision of what we're doing is to say that all of this

56
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,280
talk is mistaken and misguided or false and that we should let go of it. That's one option.

57
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,480
But the other option for the moral skeptic who wants to get rid of morality is to say that

58
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:31,680
all moral talk is not really truth apt. It's not true or false. So it's not false. It's doing

59
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,880
something else altogether and so we can keep it. We can keep this moral talk, which is a big part

60
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,480
of our lives, even though we're getting rid of morality itself. And so what we're going to get

61
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:47,680
from Ayer today in the little snippet of the chapter that we read is an account of this kind

62
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,600
of language that allows us to say that it's not true or false. It allows us to say that it's like...

63
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,120
It's like... Right? It's a kind of talk that can't be true or false and that therefore,

64
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,080
the fact that there isn't some underlying moral reality does not entail that we need

65
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:15,360
to get rid of all this talk. We can keep it. So here's something that Ayer says. This actually

66
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,040
wasn't in the part of the reading that we read for today, but it was on the reading guide that you

67
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:30,240
read. Here's what he says. So he says, value statements are not in the literal sense significant,

68
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,840
but are simply expressions of emotion, which can be neither true nor false. What does that mean?

69
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:43,040
All right. Well, let's just go through some talk, some examples of talk. Here are some things

70
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:53,280
that you can say. Ready? One thing that you could say is the door is shut. You could say that.

71
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:01,840
That's an assertion. You're telling me something about the door, right? The door is shut. This

72
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:07,840
sort of thing can be true or false. The door is shut. It's true if the door really is shut

73
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,360
and it's false if the door is not shut. That's easy. Okay, but there's lots and lots and lots

74
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,360
and lots of language that can't be true or false. One example is the one that I already gave at

75
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:28,320
the beginning of video of the video, which is if you just say or something like that. That's some

76
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:37,840
kind of exclamation or something like that or some kind of expression. And you can say that and it

77
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:43,040
can be very meaningful. That can be a very meaningful thing to say, but it's not the kind of thing

78
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:51,360
that can be true or false, right? True or false doesn't make sense. It's neither true nor false.

79
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,120
It's just merely an expression of emotion, which can be neither true nor false. That's

80
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,280
but it's not just sounds like that. Also, what if I said this is the door shut?

81
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:15,200
We have a name for utterances like this. Questions. A question also can't be true or false, right?

82
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:22,160
A question isn't making a claim about how the world is. It's not saying that the door is shut.

83
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,480
It's not saying that the door is open. It's just asking what's up with the door, right? So a question

84
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,760
can't be true or false, but it's still a perfectly meaningful thing to say. It's just not in the

85
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,520
business of describing how the world is so it can't be true or false. Or here's another one,

86
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,920
ready? Shut the door. What's that? I don't know. That's like an order or a command.

87
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:55,760
An order or a command. Can that be true or false? No. No, that can't be true or false, right?

88
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,160
It's not telling you that the door is shut. It's telling you to shut the door, right?

89
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,680
All of these, these three at least, they are all talking about the door and its status,

90
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,800
but one of them and only one of them is describing the status of the door, whether or not it's shut.

91
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,520
The others are well asking about the status of the door and commanding someone to make the door

92
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:30,960
have a certain status, being shut, right? So actually it looks like most language,

93
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,880
most talk is not the sort of thing that can be true or false. Most of the things we say or that

94
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:44,560
come out of our mouths or at least a lot of them are not assertions. All right, here's the thing.

95
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,720
These statements, the kinds of value statements that we care about, we care about moral statements,

96
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,200
we care about value statements, at least right now we do, right, in this course.

97
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:05,440
These kinds of statements, the ones that look like this, violence is wrong, right?

98
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:15,520
That statement, it sure looks like the door is shut. The door is shut. Violence is wrong.

99
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:22,000
It looks like this is an assertion. It looks like lots of our moral talk is the kind of thing

100
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,360
that can be either true or false. And therefore, if there is no such thing as right or wrong,

101
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,520
of course, then all of these statements are going to be false because they're the kind of thing that

102
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:40,880
could be false because they're assertions. But Ayer thinks, no, these aren't assertions. They

103
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,800
look like assertions. This looks like this, but actually, really, literally, all it means is

104
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,560
something like this. According to Ayer, this is the part to remember. Don't miss this. According

105
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:08,960
to Ayer, violence is wrong is really like saying, boo, violence, boo, violence. That's not the kind

106
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:14,000
of thing that can be true or false. That's not actually making an assertion about how the world

107
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,080
is. Okay, so let's go back to the sentence. Value statements are not, in the literal sense,

108
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:27,520
significant. That is, they're not assertions that can be true or false. They are simply

109
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:34,480
expressions of emotion, which can neither be true or false, which can be neither true nor false.

110
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,480
That's what Ayer is saying. Ayer is saying that value statements like this, they look like this,

111
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,120
but they're really like that. Strictly speaking, they can't be true or false. Okay, so to further

112
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:56,560
understand this point, think about the context where we say things like urgh or boo, right? Say

113
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,640
that you're at a sporting event and half of the crowd in the stands are fans of one team and half

114
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:07,200
of the crowd are fans of another team. And they introduce a player at the beginning, right? And

115
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:14,960
they say, and now the point guard for the Golden State Warriors, Stefan Curry, right? And Curry comes

116
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:24,080
out and half of the audience says boo, and the other half says yay. Imagine the announcer then

117
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:34,240
comes along and says, well, who do you think is right? Boo or yay? No one's right. No one's wrong.

118
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:41,600
No one is making a claim about how the world is. They're just merely expressing how they feel.

119
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:51,120
Okay, notice one thing about these mere expressions and assertions.

120
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:59,280
They can still be criticized, both of them actually. So compare, for example, the following two things.

121
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:10,400
I could bump into you on the street and say sorry, right? Sorry. Or an alternative thing that I could

122
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:18,880
say in the very similar or exactly the same situation is I could say I am filled with sorrow

123
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:32,400
because I bumped into you. I could say that, right? This one is an assertion. This one is not,

124
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,960
right? This can be true or false. I am filled with sorrow because I bumped into you.

125
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:44,240
This is a description of how the world is. It's true if I really am filled with sorrow.

126
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,120
And it's false if I'm not filled with sorrow. But just saying sorry, that can't be true or false.

127
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,120
You bump into somebody on the street, they say sorry, you can't come back and say,

128
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:03,120
false. I don't think you are filled with sorrow. What? You can criticize them for being insincere.

129
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,120
You can say that didn't sound sincere. I don't think you're really sorry, right? If they bump into

130
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:18,480
you in the street and they say sorry, sorry like that, that's insincere. They're not really sorry.

131
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:29,040
Sorry is capable of being insincere because it expresses a sentiment or a feeling.

132
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:38,640
It expresses a feeling and therefore it can be sincere or insincere,

133
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,600
you know, write it like that. Sincere or insincere, right? It can be sincere or insincere because

134
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,040
it expresses a sentiment and if you really have that sentiment, then it's sincere to say you're

135
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,920
sorry. But if you really don't have that sentiment, if you're not filled with sorrow, if you don't

136
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,000
have regret, then it's insincere. This can be insincere too, right? An assertion, this is an

137
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,200
assertion. It's an assertion about how the world is. It just says that the world, a very little bit

138
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:16,080
of the world, the part right here is a certain way. It says I am filled with sorrow. I feel lots

139
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:22,560
of sorrow. So this is an assertion but it also expresses a sentiment. It expresses basically

140
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:28,960
the same sentiment maybe and because it expresses that sentiment, it can also be sincere or insincere,

141
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:38,000
right? Just in the way sorrow can. But the assertion does a second thing. The other thing that it does

142
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:50,960
is that it, well, it puts forward a claim and it puts that forward, it puts forward that claim

143
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:58,800
as if it is true. It says of this, of this claim, this is the way the world really is,

144
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:05,360
this claim is true. I am filled with sorrow. It describes the world. Because of this,

145
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:11,840
it can be true or false, that assertion, right? So notice that the assertion is doing two things

146
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:18,880
and the mere expression of sorrow or sympathy is just doing one thing, right?

147
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,240
Ayer is able, because of these facts, Ayer is able to say when he translates violence is wrong

148
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,320
to boo violence, he's able to say that you're still able to criticize this kind of claim.

149
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,560
We still can criticize these claims. We criticize them as sincere or insincere.

150
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,160
We just can't strictly speaking criticize them as true or false.

151
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,000
Okay, so in a minute we're going to talk about an alternative theory, a different theory,

152
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,080
a theory other than Ayer's own theory that's also about moral talk. But let's just reiterate

153
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:02,160
really quick. This is Ayer's claim. His claim is that value statements like violence is wrong,

154
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,720
the kind of statement that he might have made to Mike Tyson during that encounter that we read

155
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,680
about, right? That kind of claim really just means boo violence. It's really not an assertion,

156
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,800
even though it looks like an assertion. Value statements are not in the literal sense significant,

157
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:24,800
but are simply expressions of emotion which can be neither true nor false. Okay,

158
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,760
he's going to now talk about an alternative theory. Let's get to that.

159
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:40,400
Remember that we are talking about language. We're talking about moral language or moral talk,

160
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:47,040
right? And our running example is this claim that Ayer might have made to Tyson or something like

161
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:59,840
that, the claim violence is wrong. Ayer says that what this claim really means is something like

162
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:14,000
boo violence. That's Ayer. All right, can you see me? Is this line in my face? It doesn't matter.

163
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,720
Violence is wrong really means boo violence. But there's an alternative theory. The name for that

164
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:30,400
theory that Ayer uses is the orthodox subjective theory. We're just going to call it subjectivism.

165
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,960
This is an alternative theory of what this phrase means. And the alternative theory just says

166
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:47,200
that this phrase means something like I dislike violence.

167
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:58,240
That's the subjectivist claim. Okay, so notice that these are very different, right? Whoops.

168
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,040
Ayer is claiming that this looks like an assertion, but it's no assertion at all. It's a mere

169
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,320
expression. It can't be true or false. The subjectivist is claiming that this assertion

170
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:20,720
is an assertion. It's just a different assertion, right? Violence is wrong looks like it's a claim

171
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,960
about violence. It looks like it's just saying violence is wrong. Really, according to the

172
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,000
subjectivist, this is an alternative to Ayer's approach that he brings up and then attacks,

173
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,840
really, according to the subjectivist, this is not a claim about violence. It's a claim about the

174
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,000
speaker. It's a claim about me when I'm talking. Let's back up for a second. We'll explain this

175
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,480
claim in a sec. But first, let's just see that these aren't the only two alternatives. This is one

176
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,600
translation of violence is wrong. This is another translation of violence is wrong. But then there's

177
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:03,920
the just sort of ordinary naive translation, right? The naive theory, the theory that you would

178
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,000
have if you weren't thinking hard about these things, and it might be the right theory, by the way.

179
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,840
The naive theory about statements like violence is wrong is just that it means

180
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:23,680
violence is wrong. That's what it means. It's an assertion. It asserts that violence has a

181
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:30,240
certain property and the property is wrongness, right? If you just take the statement, a regular

182
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:40,000
ordinary statement like grass is green, if you take an ordinary statement like that,

183
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,160
well, what does that really mean? What are you talking about? It really means that grass is green.

184
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,680
That's what it means. It's an assertion. It's true if grass is green. It's false if grass is any other

185
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:58,560
color. That's what grass is green means. Grass is green means grass is green. It says that grass

186
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,840
has a certain property of being green. That's it. You might think the same thing about violence

187
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,160
is wrong. That's the naive view. Violence is wrong just means violence is wrong. It has the feature

188
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:17,600
of being wrong. That's it. So both Ayer's theory and subjectivism are departing from the natural

189
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,280
way of interpreting this kind of language, this moral talk. Okay, but put that aside for a minute.

190
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,760
Let's understand these two alternative theories, Ayer's and subjectivism. Subjectivism means or

191
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:43,360
subjectivism claims rather that moral talk really consists of claims about the individual who's

192
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:52,640
speaking at the time. So when I say that violence is wrong, my statement can be true or false

193
00:23:52,640 --> 00:24:00,720
according to subjectivism. It can be true or false, but its truth or falsity depends not on the nature

194
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,040
of violence and whether it's really wrong. It depends just on the nature of me, the speaker,

195
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:13,600
and whether I really dislike it or something like that, whether I have some negative sentiment

196
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,640
towards it. That's what really determines whether the statement is true or false. Whereas on Ayer's

197
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:26,400
view, the statement can't be true or false at all. Ayer brings up this theory, subjectivism,

198
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,520
for three reasons. The first reason is to help clarify what his own view is. Once you see that

199
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:41,600
there's an alternative theory about what moral statements mean that makes them into assertions,

200
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,440
just different assertions than you might have thought they were, then you realize, oh whoa,

201
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,840
his theory is rather radical. It says that they are not assertions at all. They're not

202
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,640
claims that can be true or false at all. Okay, so you get a clearer sense of what his view is.

203
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,920
His view is the violence view. You get a clearer sense of what his view is by just bringing this

204
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:05,120
view up and saying, my view is not that. Okay, so that's the first reason he brings up subjectivism.

205
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,600
The second reason he brings up subjectivism is because subjectivism is obviously wrong,

206
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,680
and he can attack it, and that shows that his theory has a certain advantage. It doesn't fall

207
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:22,000
prey to the kind of attack or mistake that destroys subjectivism. He only talks about this for like

208
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,160
two sentences in the part that we read. They come and go really fast, but basically the objection

209
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,160
that kills off subjectivism but that doesn't hurt Ayer's own theory is this. Violence is wrong

210
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:44,320
or any moral claim. It seems like if it's true, it's not true because of something about the

211
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:51,120
speaker, right? Imagine that a philosopher comes to talk to you and they make some moral claim.

212
00:25:51,120 --> 00:26:00,640
They say, spending money on luxuries is evil. You cannot do it. It's wrong. Buying a cup of coffee

213
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,240
made at a coffee shop rather than just making the coffee yourself at home and donating the extra money

214
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:12,000
to famine relief is wrong. Those are all moral claims. They make moral claims like that and maybe

215
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,440
you start arguing with them and you say, oh no, you know, I live in a capitalist society and blah,

216
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,160
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The philosopher can't just come back and say, no, no, no, no,

217
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:29,360
you don't understand. It's wrong. Let me prove it to you. And then they cut open their skull

218
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,280
and rip it open and put a brain scanner on them. And then the brain scanner reads off on a screen

219
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,600
and there on the screen it says, it shows all the things that they think and right there on the

220
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:52,400
screen it says, this guy dislikes coffee. That's what it said on the screen of the brain scanner

221
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,800
or it says something like, this guy dislikes spending money on coffee instead of donating

222
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,200
that money to famine relief. Does that, does that evidence, that brain scan evidence,

223
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:09,840
does that prove that the moral statement, you know, coffee is evil?

224
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:20,000
Does that prove that this statement is true? This brain scan? Brain scan? No, no it doesn't. No one

225
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,120
takes that seriously. That's not the kind of evidence that you'd ever try to give for a moral

226
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,320
statement like this. It's just obvious. We take this for granted in all of our moral discourse.

227
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,840
It's just obvious that moral statements like this are not statements about the speaker. If I

228
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,920
make a statement about me, we all know that it's a statement about me and we talk as if it's a

229
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:53,360
statement about me. I say, I'm exhausted and someone might say, oh, is it because you haven't

230
00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:00,640
gotten enough sleep? It's all about me, right? Whereas if I say violence is wrong, no one says,

231
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,320
oh, is it because you're like a curmudgeonly person and you dislike a lot of stuff? Is that why

232
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,600
violence is wrong? No, that's not why violence is wrong. That might be why I think it's wrong,

233
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,040
but my thinking that it's wrong or my disliking it, that's not the same as it's being wrong.

234
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:24,320
If this is true, it sure isn't true just because I dislike violence. This theory,

235
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,760
subjectivism, this theory is no good. It makes this crazy claim that these statements are true

236
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,360
or false based on what the speaker is thinking or what the speaker feels, and that's just not

237
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:42,560
how anyone thinks about morality. So that is the second reason why air brings up subjectivism,

238
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:48,880
is to argue against it in that way. And it shows that air's view doesn't have that problem. I mean,

239
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:55,600
air's view is in a way more radical. It says that moral statements don't even have truth values,

240
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,400
but that radicalness gives it the advantage of not having to say that the truth value of a

241
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,080
moral statement depends on the speaker of the statement or the mind of the speaker of that

242
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:16,160
moral statement. Okay, so he argues against subjectivism in that way, but then the third reason,

243
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:23,760
the third reason that air brings up subjectivism is to give an objection to subjectivism,

244
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,240
raise an objection that comes from the philosopher G.E. Moore. Moore's objection.

245
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,120
So this objection is not like the one that we just saw towards subjectivism,

246
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,720
where it only applies to subjectivism and doesn't also apply to air's view. This objection, if it

247
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:50,160
works, also is a problem for air's own view. So we're going to talk about that objection,

248
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,080
and then we're going to get air's response to it. This all happens in like the four pages that we

249
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,680
read. So what is Moore's objection? This happens, by the way, in the reading that we're using

250
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,360
on page 110. We get an explanation of Moore's objection, and then also on 110 going on to 111,

251
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,800
we get air's response. So if you follow and understand everything I'm saying about Moore's

252
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,400
objection and air's response, but you didn't pick it up in the reading, go back to those pages,

253
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:24,880
reread those pages to get Moore's objection and air's response. Okay, well, what is Moore's objection?

254
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,200
The objection is this. Fundamentally, Moore is claiming that

255
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:38,880
we have genuine moral disagreements. We have genuine moral debates. We productively argue with one

256
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:46,240
another about morality, and when we do this, we literally contradict one another. When we have

257
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,600
moral debates or moral discussions, we very frequently have situations where one person

258
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,480
says something, and the other person says, no, that's not the case. That's false, right? So one

259
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:13,840
person says abortion is wrong, and another person says abortion is permissible. It's not wrong.

260
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:22,320
It might not be great, but it's not something that's always wrong. These two folks are disagreeing

261
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,600
with one another. They are contradicting one another. They cannot both be right.

262
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,440
If air's view is true, then they're not really contradicting one another, because really one of

263
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:48,960
them is just saying, boo, abortion. That's the first one. The other one is saying, okay, abortion.

264
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,360
They're not contradicting one each other, one another. If one person says boo, and the other

265
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,560
person says yay, and they're screaming back and forth at each other from across a stadium

266
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:06,240
at a sporting event, they're not arguing. Now, there's a sense in which there is a tension

267
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,720
between the sentiments that they are expressing. One of them feels a certain way, and the other

268
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,920
person feels a different way, and an individual person can't coherently feel both ways at the

269
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:23,200
same time. They can't, as it were, well, be in favor of something and be against it at the same time,

270
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,160
right? But that doesn't mean that the things that they've said contradict one another. They're not

271
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,920
productively disagreeing. Here's an example that goes back a little bit to subjectivism. Say that

272
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:39,840
I'm sitting at a table eating pickled tomatoes, and someone comes up to me and says, I don't like

273
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,320
pickled tomatoes. And I say, I do like pickled tomatoes. And they say, I don't like pickled

274
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:55,280
tomatoes. And I say, but I like them. We don't disagree with one another. We're just screaming

275
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,480
back and forth, and I'm talking about me, and this other person is talking about themselves.

276
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:06,160
And so we don't really disagree. There's a kind of confusion. We are, as it were, talking past

277
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:12,240
one another. If you're a subjectivist about moral talk, then you have to say that disagreements,

278
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,680
like this one, are really just two people shouting back and forth at each other when they're really

279
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:21,120
each talking about different things. One of them is talking about themselves, and the other one

280
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,400
is talking about themselves. And so too with air. Moral disagreements like this, it looks like

281
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:29,920
these people are arguing with one another, but they're not really arguing with one another.

282
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,200
One is just yelling boo, and one is just yelling yay. And here's Moore's claim.

283
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:45,120
Moral disagreements are real. They're genuine. They exist. And so any theory, Moore thinks,

284
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,280
that gets the results that there aren't moral disagreements, that theory is no good.

285
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:55,360
That's Moore's objection. Okay. What's air's response to Moore's objection?

286
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,880
All right. Air does something that in philosophy, we call biting the bullet.

287
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,040
You bite a bullet in real life. I mean, you probably hopefully will never bite a bullet.

288
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,960
You bite a bullet in real life when you have to do something really painful, like get surgery

289
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,520
without anesthesia. And you're supposed to bite the bullet in order to bear the pain.

290
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,960
So air is, as it were, going to take on something that's a little bit painful,

291
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,800
but he's going to do it to save his theory, which he thinks has many other advantages.

292
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:36,640
He just bites the bullet and accepts that we don't have genuine moral disagreements.

293
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:46,400
He denies that we have genuine moral disagreements. He says that it looks like we have genuine moral

294
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,480
disagreements, but we really don't. How can he possibly say that? It really seems like we have

295
00:34:52,480 --> 00:35:01,680
moral disagreements. Here's a little bit of an argument for air's view that defends him from

296
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:10,720
Moore's objection. Say that we're talking about public policy, drug policy, right? Here's a moral

297
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,880
claim. Marijuana, that's just how I'm going to write marijuana because I don't know how to spell it,

298
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:27,200
marijuana should be legal. Let's say you think that. Well, if you do think that you're using

299
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,280
moral language, you're making a moral claim, you're talking about what should be the case.

300
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:40,080
You're talking about how our society ought to be arranged. What is the just way to arrange our

301
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:46,480
legal system and our laws? This is a moral statement if there ever was one, right? Marijuana should

302
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,960
be legal. Okay, say you were arguing for that claim or you were arguing against it. What might you

303
00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:00,160
say? Think about it. Actually pause the video right now and make up an argument either for the

304
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,880
claim that marijuana should be legal or that it shouldn't. You didn't pause the video. No, you

305
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,840
don't really pause it. You're not actually going to think of something. You're just going to keep

306
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,240
on watching. Okay, well, listen. Here's what you could have said. Here's what you probably would

307
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,200
have said. You might have said something like this. Well, marijuana should be legal because

308
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:29,760
marijuana maybe stops seizures. Oh, I don't know how to spell seizures, but something like that.

309
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,320
Okay, marijuana stops seizures. You might argue in favor of marijuana legalization by making that

310
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:46,240
point. Or if you're an opponent of a marijuana legalization, you might say marijuana impairs

311
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:57,200
judgment impairs judgment. And that in turn causes car crashes, which cause death. We could go back

312
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,080
and forth about all of this sort of stuff. But did you notice something? This was a moral statement,

313
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,360
a normative statement about a statement about how things should be. But then when we started to

314
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:15,040
actually have this debate or started to have this discussion, all of the claims that we started

315
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:26,720
hearing were factual claims. They were factual claims. Factual. These ones are factual. This one

316
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:34,560
is moral or normative in at least some sense. But these are not claims about how things should be.

317
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,400
The fact that marijuana stops seizures, if it does, in some cases, is not a fact about how

318
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,160
things should be. It's a fact about how things are. It just is true that this chemical interacts with

319
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,240
this other chemical in this certain way. That's it. It's a factual claim. It's not a moral claim.

320
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,240
It's a factual claim. Same thing for marijuana causes impairment, which in turn causes car crashes

321
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,040
if you're driving. That's a factual claim. That's a claim about chemicals. Chemicals interacting

322
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,400
with other chemicals, chemicals in the marijuana, chemicals in your brain, nerves leading to your

323
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:17,440
hands and feet when you're driving. These are all factual claims. Ayer thinks this. He thinks that

324
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:25,680
when we are having disagreements that are genuine, they're not really moral. And when we're having

325
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:33,680
disagreements that are really moral, they're not really genuine. We can have a genuine disagreement

326
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:40,320
about, well, whether marijuana should be legal. But that's only because we're really at the

327
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:48,240
underlying level disagreeing about some factual claim, whether or not marijuana stops seizures

328
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,320
or whether or not marijuana has some other effects or something like that. We're just

329
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,800
disagreeing about factual things. We're able to have that disagreement because under the surface,

330
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:06,320
there is actually some degree of moral agreement. We agree about something. Namely, we agree,

331
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:15,920
well, we agree about something moral. We agree that stopping seizures, I still don't know how to

332
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,840
spell seizures, is good. That's a moral claim too. We agree about this. And it's only because we have

333
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,040
this kind of agreement. We have the same sentiments here that we're able to have this kind of

334
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,280
disagreement. Moore's claim is that we can have our sentiments aligned on certain things, on

335
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,160
certain matters. We can have the same sentiments. We would express them in the same thing. And then

336
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,960
when we get to the level of disagreement, really, we are disagreeing about factual things because

337
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:54,880
there's some underlying moral convergence. That's his response to Moore's objection, is that we don't

338
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,120
have genuine moral disagreements, or at least not nearly as often as we think we do, what we have

339
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:09,920
are moral agreements and genuine non-moral disagreements. Now, we are able to explain what

340
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,680
I think is the most difficult sentence in the reading. So right now, I'm going to explain to

341
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,480
you, given everything I just said, what this very difficult sentence said. So let me get the sentence.

342
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,000
Here's the sentence. It happens on the bottom of page 111. And I'm going to write it up now,

343
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,720
and then we're going to use everything that we just said, our understanding of Aire's view,

344
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,840
our understanding of subjectivism, and Moore's objection to subjectivism, and then Aire's response

345
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:48,000
to Moore's objection. We're going to use all of that to understand what this sentence says. Okay, here it is.

346
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Let's go through it real slow. If our opponent concurs with us in expressing moral disapproval

347
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:07,040
of all actions of a given type T, then we may get him to condemn a particular action A by bringing

348
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:14,320
forward arguments to show that A is of type T. Okay, what's going on? The background is that Moore

349
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:22,080
is talking about how actual moral disagreements work, how we actually try to persuade one another

350
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:30,880
to change our minds about moral matters. Suppose you wanted to convince some people

351
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,200
that marijuana should be illegal. You were Jeff Sessions or something like that. You want to convince

352
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:51,120
folks that marijuana, I really hope that's how you spell it, right, should be illegal. Okay,

353
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,640
you want to convince someone of that fact. How do you go about doing it? Well, we just heard

354
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,440
that Aire's response to Moore involved him saying that underneath this disagreement,

355
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,840
where one person thinks that it should be illegal, and the other person thinks it's fine, it should

356
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:16,240
be legal, right, underneath this disagreement are factual disagreements, and then underneath those

357
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:25,120
factual disagreements are moral agreements, right. So here's something, here's something that, well,

358
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,920
if you're Jeff Sessions and you're trying to argue for this, you know that your opponent is going to

359
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:38,080
agree with you about, okay. They're going to agree with you that we're talking about behavior that

360
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:43,440
leads to murder. Everyone is going to agree that that's bad. They're going to have the same negative

361
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:52,480
sentiments towards that, right. Okay, everyone agrees that this is bad. Let's call this type of

362
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:05,760
behavior, behavior type T. Behavior type T is any behavior that leads to murder. Okay, and then

363
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,960
let's talk about some more specific type of behavior, behavior type A, and this will be

364
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,800
smoking marijuana. Let's say you were Jeff Sessions, you thought that marijuana was terrible,

365
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,600
it should be illegal. You know that everyone agrees with you that if something leads to murder,

366
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:31,520
then it should be illegal too. So you just have to, well, make a factual claim. You make the

367
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:41,040
following factual claim that this type of behavior, smoking marijuana, is really just some of this

368
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:47,680
type of behavior. It's a subset. Smoking marijuana is one type of behavior that leads to murder,

369
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,560
and you do this with science or made up science if you don't have real science to back you up,

370
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,040
right, or whatever you're going to use, right. This is a factual claim. The factual claim is that

371
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,760
smoking marijuana is a type of behavior that leads to murder. That's a factual claim.

372
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,800
Ayer is saying that this sort of thing is what goes on when we have moral disagreements, right,

373
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,960
and that his theory is perfectly able to explain this. All right, let's go back to the quote.

374
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,640
Let's read it again. If our opponent concurs with us, so if our opponent agrees with us, if we all

375
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:36,480
agree, what do we agree about? We agree in expressing moral disapproval of all actions of a given type

376
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:48,080
T. So we all disapprove of anything that leads to murder, right? Okay, so we all agree that this

377
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:57,520
is to be disapproved of, any action of a given type T. Then we may get him our opponent, okay,

378
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,800
we may get our opponent to condemn a particular action A, right, so we want to condemn A. You're

379
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:12,960
Jeff Sessions, you want to condemn A, right? We may get him to condemn, we may get our opponent

380
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:22,560
to condemn this by bringing forward arguments to show that A is of type T, to show that this

381
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,760
is really of this type, that this is the claim. Now, I'm not saying it's true and I'm not saying

382
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,120
it's false, I'm just saying that according to Ayer, this is the kind of moral argument that we

383
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:40,880
make. We say that this type of action is really of this type of action and we already agree in

384
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:48,960
condemning this type of action and so by making this factual claim, it's a factual claim to say

385
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:54,480
that smoking marijuana leads to murder, that's just a factual claim, that's not a moral claim,

386
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,400
right? This kind of factual claim is the kind of claim that we actually disagree about and that

387
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:06,000
that's what's really at the heart of moral disagreements. One last thing before we're done.

388
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,360
We've said all these things about Ayer's theory and Ayer's theory one more time is a theory of

389
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:26,080
moral talk or moral language, not of morality itself. Why again do we care about moral talk

390
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:33,920
or moral language? The answer, I've already said this but it's worth repeating, is that if you want

391
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:43,360
to be a moral skeptic, if you want to deny that there really is any such thing as morality,

392
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,680
then you're going to need to explain all of the moral talk. Are you going to say that it's all

393
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,000
false? Ayer is able to say if he's right about moral talk, which he might not be, but if he's

394
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,960
right about it then he's able to say that, well, morality is not real but we don't have to throw

395
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,480
out all of our moral discourse and all of our moral language, that's fine. We disagree about

396
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:14,800
factual matters that are underlying our moral debates and when we do express moral sentiments,

397
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:21,360
we do so in a way that doesn't also assert that things are true. So we don't have to throw out

398
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:26,080
all of our moral talk because it's all false, just because we're moral skeptics, because moral

399
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:30,320
talk was never the kind of thing that was true or false in the first place.
