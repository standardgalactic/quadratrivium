00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
It's a very radical conclusion, and the problem is it's very hard to see what's wrong with

00:07.600 --> 00:08.940
the argument.

00:08.940 --> 00:14.860
The argument seems like a good one, and it has seemed that way to everyone who read this

00:14.860 --> 00:16.900
paper since 1972.

00:16.900 --> 00:23.660
Today we're talking about an absolutely revolutionary paper published by a philosopher

00:23.660 --> 00:28.680
named Peter Singer in 1972.

00:28.680 --> 00:33.640
The name of the paper is Famine Affluence and Morality.

00:33.640 --> 00:42.840
And the basic idea is that the moral stance that you have, your attitude towards your

00:42.840 --> 00:49.320
moral obligations and the things that you may or may not do in your life, and the attitude

00:49.320 --> 00:56.080
that all of your friends and all of your relatives have, the general moral outlook that everyone

00:56.080 --> 00:59.760
around you has, is deeply and profoundly wrong.

00:59.760 --> 01:08.120
And the crazy thing about this paper is that, on the surface at least, it's very persuasive.

01:08.120 --> 01:12.080
He seems, Singer, seems to be right.

01:12.080 --> 01:18.720
It seems to be, once you go through the argument that he lays out, it seems to be that we need

01:18.720 --> 01:22.760
to completely rework our entire society.

01:22.760 --> 01:26.920
And more specifically, forget about society for a minute.

01:26.920 --> 01:32.480
You need to completely rework your life if your life is going to be a moral one.

01:32.480 --> 01:39.000
And sort of what makes the paper so radical is that I can say all of these things, that

01:39.000 --> 01:43.360
the thesis of the paper is that you need to completely rework your life without knowing

01:43.360 --> 01:45.080
anything about you.

01:45.080 --> 01:49.880
I know virtually nothing about your life and your moral outlook and your values and the

01:49.880 --> 01:52.800
kinds of things that you do on a day-to-day basis.

01:52.800 --> 01:59.160
I can basically make some assumptions about my audience, general assumptions.

01:59.160 --> 02:04.880
You live in a broadly capitalistic society, let's assume.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.960
There are government regulations and that sort of thing.

02:06.960 --> 02:12.960
And you live sometime in the beginning-ish of the 21st century.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.440
That's basically enough.

02:14.440 --> 02:21.080
If that's true of you, then Singer thinks that your whole life needs to be reworked

02:21.080 --> 02:24.480
if you're going to live in a morally acceptable way.

02:24.480 --> 02:29.240
Okay, if we're going to understand this argument, then we need one distinction to start out.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.000
This is a technical distinction, but there's really only one technical term.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.200
Here you go.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.960
We're talking about the distinction between the super-erogatory and the obligatory.

02:39.960 --> 02:45.040
Imagine this, you're getting together with a group of friends or coworkers or something

02:45.040 --> 02:50.760
like that and you decide, you know what, this is a pretty early gathering.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.480
It's a pretty early meeting.

02:52.480 --> 02:58.120
And so wouldn't it be nice if I went and got everyone some coffee and danishes because

02:58.120 --> 03:01.040
some people are going to be rushing out of their house and they're not going to have

03:01.040 --> 03:02.400
time to eat breakfast.

03:02.400 --> 03:09.520
And so when everyone shows up, surprise, surprise, there is some coffee and donuts and treats

03:09.520 --> 03:13.200
or whatever that you brought for everyone and you paid for and you're just giving it

03:13.200 --> 03:15.160
to them and you say, hey guys, I brought these for you.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.880
I want you to have them.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.640
That act, that action is super-erogatory.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.720
It's extra.

03:22.720 --> 03:24.040
It's super.

03:24.040 --> 03:27.920
You didn't have to do it, but it was a really nice thing to do.

03:27.920 --> 03:31.800
It was an extra thing that you did and it was a good thing to do.

03:31.800 --> 03:34.520
It was not obligatory.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.200
Something is obligatory if you have to do it.

03:37.200 --> 03:43.960
So if someone is assigned in the group to bring coffee and breakfast to every early

03:43.960 --> 03:49.320
morning meeting and you signed up, you promised, you committed to bringing coffee and breakfast

03:49.320 --> 03:53.200
on that day, well then bringing coffee and breakfast is obligatory.

03:53.200 --> 03:57.440
And of course it would be nice if everyone thanked you for bringing those things even

03:57.440 --> 03:59.760
if you agreed or promised to do it.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.000
It wasn't extra.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.200
It was something you had to do.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.600
You had committed to it.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.000
You were obliged to do it.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.040
One more example just to bring out this distinction.

04:10.040 --> 04:11.960
And this example may date this video.

04:11.960 --> 04:16.600
It may give you a sense of when I'm making this video, but anyway, at the time of the

04:16.600 --> 04:21.360
recording of this video, there's something going on in supermarkets where when you check

04:21.360 --> 04:26.280
out in the supermarket and you're paying for your groceries or whatever, well there's

04:26.280 --> 04:29.280
some of the payment is obligatory.

04:29.280 --> 04:35.040
You have to pay for the things that you are buying, but then there's this extra payment.

04:35.040 --> 04:39.360
They say when you're checking out, they're like, would you like to donate $1 to and then

04:39.360 --> 04:40.680
they name some charity?

04:40.680 --> 04:44.760
Would you like to add $1 to your bill here at the supermarket?

04:44.760 --> 04:47.120
That additional payment, that's extra.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.680
You don't have to do it.

04:48.680 --> 04:49.680
It's up to you.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.080
It's super-erogatory.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.760
If you do do it, it's good.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.400
That's a nice thing that you did, right?

04:54.400 --> 04:55.600
But you didn't have to.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
Super-erogatory.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.040
That's what that word means.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.680
Okay, here's the claim of this paper.

05:01.680 --> 05:06.280
The claim is that there are these organizations that exist in the world now.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.600
Now in 1972, says Singer.

05:09.600 --> 05:15.160
These organizations like Oxfam and UNICEF, these are organizations that take money from

05:15.160 --> 05:20.360
people who live in relatively wealthy places on the planet.

05:20.360 --> 05:26.000
They take that money and they use it to do amazing things for people who are suffering

05:26.000 --> 05:27.520
under things like famines.

05:27.520 --> 05:31.640
If there's a famine in some place in the world, there's not enough food and people are literally

05:31.640 --> 05:33.560
starving to death.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.840
They are dying because they don't have enough food.

05:36.840 --> 05:43.000
So someone donates a little bit of money and these organizations take that money and a

05:43.000 --> 05:47.320
very high percentage of that money with a great deal of efficiency gets transported to

05:47.320 --> 05:54.640
this other place on the planet where there's a famine and literal people's lives are saved.

05:54.640 --> 06:00.240
Normally we, you and I and all of your relatives and all of your friends, everyone in our society

06:00.240 --> 06:06.440
and our broader society, we think of these sorts of acts, giving charity in this way,

06:06.440 --> 06:09.240
giving money to Oxfam or UNICEF or whatever.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.720
We think of these things as supererogatory.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.000
Giving to charity is supererogatory.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.600
It's nice, it's good, but you don't have to do it.

06:18.600 --> 06:22.800
If on any given occasion you don't do it, you're not a bad person, it's not like you

06:22.800 --> 06:25.880
failed to live up to some obligation that you had.

06:25.880 --> 06:33.960
The writer says, no, here's an argument that proves, Singer thinks, that giving to charity,

06:33.960 --> 06:41.560
giving extra money to famine relief, if you're affluent, if you have extra money, is something

06:41.560 --> 06:43.560
that you must do.

06:43.560 --> 06:50.280
You must do it in the same way that you must not murder or you must catch someone.

06:50.280 --> 06:53.680
If they're falling and you can just reach out your arms and catch them and save them,

06:53.680 --> 06:55.200
you must do it.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.200
That's the thesis.

06:56.200 --> 07:02.360
Okay, so Singer has an argument for this thesis, an argument for this conclusion, but we're

07:02.360 --> 07:04.480
going to get to the argument in one minute.

07:04.480 --> 07:09.800
First let's just skip to the end of the paper and see his statement of that conclusion.

07:09.800 --> 07:14.000
Here's what he says.

07:14.000 --> 07:19.800
Here's what Singer says, because giving money is regarded as an act of charity, it is not

07:19.800 --> 07:23.280
thought that there is anything wrong with not giving.

07:23.280 --> 07:28.120
The charitable man, or if we want, because this was written in 1972, we can say the charitable

07:28.120 --> 07:29.120
person.

07:29.120 --> 07:36.880
The charitable person may be praised, but the person who is not charitable is not condemned.

07:36.880 --> 07:43.120
People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new clothes or a new

07:43.120 --> 07:46.280
car instead of giving it to famine relief.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.320
Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.320
What's the alternative?

07:50.320 --> 07:55.400
The alternative is not getting those new clothes and not getting that new car and instead taking

07:55.400 --> 07:59.080
that money that you would have spent on new clothes and just, well, wearing your old clothes

07:59.080 --> 08:04.160
and taking that money and giving it to an organization that will help people, that will

08:04.160 --> 08:07.240
save people who are dying of famine.

08:07.240 --> 08:12.680
That possibility, the possibility of not spending money on luxuries, does not occur

08:12.680 --> 08:15.760
to most people or to virtually anyone.

08:15.760 --> 08:20.300
This way of looking at the matter cannot be justified.

08:20.300 --> 08:24.380
This way of looking at the matter is the way that we all look at the matter.

08:24.380 --> 08:30.900
That is, we think that giving money to famine relief is super erogatory.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.900
It's nice.

08:31.900 --> 08:35.260
It's an extra thing that cannot be justified.

08:35.260 --> 08:38.940
The only thing, according to Singer, that can be justified, and we're going to get to

08:38.940 --> 08:43.660
the argument for this conclusion, the only thing that can be justified is the way of

08:43.660 --> 08:47.620
thinking where you think that giving to famine relief instead of buying new clothes or a new

08:47.620 --> 08:51.660
car or whatever, giving to famine relief is obligatory.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.500
That's the only way of thinking that can be justified.

08:54.500 --> 08:58.020
The upshot or the punchline is this.

08:58.020 --> 09:04.900
If you don't give to famine relief, Singer thinks, you've done something wrong.

09:04.900 --> 09:09.540
You've done something evil, bad.

09:09.540 --> 09:16.660
Every time you buy new clothes that you don't absolutely need or you buy a new car when you

09:16.660 --> 09:24.020
could just drive your old car or you buy a cup of coffee that someone else made for you

09:24.020 --> 09:27.580
because it's more convenient for them to make it for you and it tastes a little better than

09:27.580 --> 09:29.260
if you were to make it at home.

09:29.260 --> 09:32.180
Every time you do any of those things, you're doing something wrong.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.820
You're doing something bad.

09:33.820 --> 09:35.820
We don't think this way.

09:35.820 --> 09:41.420
No one in our society, not in 1972 and even though this is a super famous paper, you've

09:41.420 --> 09:46.520
maybe never heard of it and so it didn't seep into the whole society even now, right?

09:46.520 --> 09:51.640
People don't think that buying new clothes or buying a cup of coffee from a coffee shop

09:51.640 --> 09:56.880
is a bad thing to do, an evil thing to do, a wrong thing to do, but Singer thinks that

09:56.880 --> 10:01.480
it is and here's his argument for that conclusion.

10:01.480 --> 10:06.720
Okay, here's the argument.

10:06.720 --> 10:12.840
Singer doesn't lay out the argument like this with four premises and one conclusion or anything.

10:12.840 --> 10:17.760
I'm pulling these out of the paper, but this is indeed the argument.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.760
Here's how it goes.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.760
Let's take it one step at a time.

10:20.760 --> 10:27.800
One, if it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening without thereby sacrificing

10:27.800 --> 10:32.860
anything of moral significance, then we must morally do it.

10:32.860 --> 10:35.840
That is, prevent that very bad thing from happening.

10:35.840 --> 10:38.160
Okay, that's premise one.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.840
I'll just give you a hint.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.600
This is going to be the most controversial claim, right?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.440
It's a very general claim.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.400
It's talking about very bad things.

10:47.400 --> 10:53.000
It's got this big category of very bad things and then it's got this other category of things

10:53.000 --> 10:55.800
that you might sacrifice that are not of moral significance.

10:55.800 --> 10:56.800
That's another big category.

10:56.800 --> 11:01.120
It's a big grand claim about what you must do morally and it's a very general claim.

11:01.120 --> 11:05.040
So one is going to be the most controversial claim in this argument.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.480
So we'll come back to this.

11:06.480 --> 11:11.880
If you're looking for this claim, by the way, in the reading, then go to page 235.

11:11.880 --> 11:18.240
There's one big paragraph in the middle of page 235 and this claim happens, not phrased

11:18.240 --> 11:23.200
exactly like this, but basically like this, at the sort of end of that paragraph.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.680
Anyway, let's keep going.

11:25.680 --> 11:32.640
Step two, hunger, disease, and other sources of suffering, disability, and death are very

11:32.640 --> 11:34.640
bad.

11:34.640 --> 11:38.680
Okay, those are some examples of very bad things.

11:38.680 --> 11:43.240
We see how this is going to connect up with the first premise, right?

11:43.240 --> 11:48.600
We've got a bunch of very bad things and it's said in the first premise that if it's in

11:48.600 --> 11:54.800
your power or if it's in our power to prevent something very bad, well then we've got to

11:54.800 --> 11:55.800
do that thing.

11:55.800 --> 11:56.800
We've got to prevent those things.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.120
So these are going to be the things that we're going to need to prevent this argument's

12:00.120 --> 12:01.120
going to claim.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.960
It's just specifying some very bad things.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.960
And premise two, by the way, seems totally plausible.

12:08.960 --> 12:15.880
Hunger, disease, and other sources of suffering, disability, and death are very bad.

12:15.880 --> 12:18.400
Yes, that's plausible.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.400
Hunger is very bad.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.440
Real hunger, where someone doesn't have enough food to eat.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.000
And disease.

12:24.000 --> 12:29.000
And other things that cause people to suffer or become disabled or die.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.200
All of that is bad.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.200
Yep, okay.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.200
Good job.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.240
Premise two, very plausible.

12:35.240 --> 12:42.320
Premise three, the luxuries on which we spend money are not of moral significance.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.600
So the kinds of luxuries he's talking about are these luxuries, right?

12:45.600 --> 12:46.600
Buying new clothes.

12:46.600 --> 12:52.440
When your old clothes, although out of fashion or a little tattered or whatever, are perfectly

12:52.440 --> 12:53.440
good.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.960
Or buying a new car.

12:54.960 --> 13:01.480
When your old car, although not as good as a new car, is still a good enough car, right?

13:01.680 --> 13:05.600
The example that I gave earlier, buying a cup of coffee when you could make the coffee

13:05.600 --> 13:07.280
at home.

13:07.280 --> 13:12.280
Really going to any restaurant ever, right, counts as a luxury in this sense.

13:12.280 --> 13:16.440
I mean, you can always just, for less money, make food at home.

13:16.440 --> 13:22.160
This connects with the idea of moral significance or of some things not being of moral significance,

13:22.160 --> 13:23.660
right?

13:23.660 --> 13:26.360
Sacrificing anything of moral significance.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.160
That's part of the first premise also.

13:28.160 --> 13:33.440
So premise three is specifying the kinds of things that aren't of moral significance.

13:33.440 --> 13:38.160
And once we understand what singer means by luxuries, he's right.

13:38.160 --> 13:40.200
These things are not of moral significance.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.200
They're not a big deal.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.920
If you go without them, you're not really worse off.

13:44.920 --> 13:53.720
Four, by donating money to relief agencies like Oxfam, we could prevent hunger, disease,

13:53.720 --> 13:56.880
and other sources of suffering, disability, and death.

13:57.240 --> 14:03.520
Well, that's just saying that there's a very specific way, an easy way, right?

14:03.520 --> 14:09.120
To prevent these things which premise two established were very bad.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.640
Premise four, is it true?

14:10.640 --> 14:14.760
By donating money to relief agencies like Oxfam, we could prevent hunger, disease, and

14:14.760 --> 14:17.160
other sources of suffering, disability, and death.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.120
Yes, premise four is true.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.520
This is true.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.120
These organizations do do this.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.720
You can give them the money and then they will prevent these things.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.160
Yes, premise four is just an empirical claim.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.920
It's just a claim about whether these organizations actually do the thing that they say they're

14:33.920 --> 14:34.920
going to do.

14:34.920 --> 14:36.800
And the answer is yes, they do do it.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.400
Okay, and then here's the conclusion.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.680
And we've already reached this conclusion.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.600
We've already talked through this conclusion.

14:41.600 --> 14:47.160
Therefore, we must, must, where is it?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.160
Where is it?

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
Must.

14:49.160 --> 14:50.160
We are obligated.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.160
It's not super erogatory.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.360
It's not extra.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.480
This is something you have to do.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.960
And so the conclusion gets us something you have to do.

14:56.960 --> 15:03.920
We must morally donate the money that we spend on luxuries to relief agencies.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.760
And we don't get to spend them on luxuries.

15:05.760 --> 15:07.160
This is the argument.

15:07.160 --> 15:12.840
Okay, so now is a good time to reemphasize how radical this conclusion is.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.480
We're about to assess the argument.

15:14.480 --> 15:18.520
We're really going to focus almost entirely on premise one because premise one is the

15:18.520 --> 15:20.760
only controversial premise in the argument.

15:20.760 --> 15:21.760
Everything else.

15:21.760 --> 15:22.760
Steps two, three, and four.

15:22.920 --> 15:26.880
I mean, these just seem to be obviously correct, obviously true statements.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.440
And the argument is, is valid.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.040
So well, one is the only option that we could argue against, and we're going to try to argue

15:34.040 --> 15:35.040
against it.

15:35.040 --> 15:38.000
And Singer is going to say no, and none of those arguments work.

15:38.000 --> 15:42.720
Okay, but focusing again on the conclusion for a minute before we get back to premise

15:42.720 --> 15:45.880
one, this is pretty radical.

15:45.880 --> 15:51.240
No one thinks that we have a moral obligation, no one, none of your friends, none of your

15:51.240 --> 15:57.280
family think that you must not buy a cup of coffee.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.040
You must not buy a new car.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.440
You must not buy new clothes.

16:00.440 --> 16:07.720
Instead, you must take all of that money and donate it to some organization like Oxfam.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.280
One of these relief agencies.

16:09.280 --> 16:12.160
No one lives their life like this, or very few people.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.600
Peter Singer, by the way, he's still alive.

16:14.600 --> 16:15.760
I met him, right?

16:15.760 --> 16:16.760
We had dinner once.

16:16.760 --> 16:17.760
He gave a talk.

16:17.760 --> 16:18.760
And then I...

16:18.760 --> 16:19.760
Anyway, I know him.

16:19.760 --> 16:20.760
I know celebrities.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.920
Peter Singer, who's still alive, kind of lives his life like this.

16:25.920 --> 16:32.240
He donates a very significant, non-truvial portion of his income, which is not enormous.

16:32.240 --> 16:36.440
It's not an enormous income to relief agencies.

16:36.440 --> 16:37.840
He does this.

16:37.840 --> 16:42.320
He does not live a luxurious life, not a life that we would normally call luxurious.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.280
Okay, so there's one.

16:44.280 --> 16:47.460
And then maybe there's, I don't know, a few of his friends who he convinced.

16:47.460 --> 16:50.780
But most people don't live their life like this.

16:50.780 --> 17:01.500
The conclusion of this paper is that most people, you included, are doing something bad every

17:01.500 --> 17:03.140
day.

17:03.140 --> 17:04.780
And you don't even realize it.

17:04.780 --> 17:09.220
Okay, enough about how radical this conclusion is or whatever and how much it departs from

17:09.220 --> 17:10.580
your day-to-day life.

17:10.580 --> 17:11.580
Let's get to premise one.

17:11.580 --> 17:13.380
This is the controversial premise.

17:13.380 --> 17:18.460
What does Singer say to support such a broad sweeping claim?

17:18.460 --> 17:20.220
Here's what he says.

17:24.220 --> 17:30.300
This is a rather famous example that Singer gives to support premise one.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.300
Here it is.

17:31.300 --> 17:37.260
If I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in

17:37.260 --> 17:39.300
and pull the child out.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.840
This will mean getting my clothes muddy.

17:41.840 --> 17:46.520
But this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad

17:46.520 --> 17:48.020
thing.

17:48.020 --> 17:52.120
Okay, got the example, right?

17:52.120 --> 17:54.920
There's a shallow pond or a fountain.

17:54.920 --> 18:00.520
When I teach this class on campus, every college campus, including the one where I work in

18:00.520 --> 18:04.440
North Carolina, every college campus has like a fountain somewhere, right?

18:04.440 --> 18:06.440
There's a fountain there.

18:06.440 --> 18:10.580
A small child is drowning in the fountain and will die.

18:10.580 --> 18:12.440
You are walking by.

18:12.440 --> 18:17.280
You can easily step in and save the child.

18:17.280 --> 18:23.240
The cost to you will be just a few moments and, well, your clothes are going to get wet

18:23.240 --> 18:24.560
or muddy, right?

18:24.560 --> 18:27.760
Muddy if it's a pond or wet, if it's a fountain or whatever.

18:27.760 --> 18:33.840
This sacrifice, by the way, is not of moral significance, right?

18:33.840 --> 18:36.800
It is insignificant that your clothes are going to get a little wet.

18:36.800 --> 18:40.720
Oh, and you're on your way to something where you didn't want your clothes to be wet.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.040
Okay, that's not a very significant sacrifice.

18:44.040 --> 18:51.520
But the death of the child, the drowning death of the child in almost all circumstances would

18:51.520 --> 18:53.640
be a very bad thing.

18:53.640 --> 18:56.720
Well, the thought is go from this example.

18:56.720 --> 19:01.160
If you agree with what Singer says about this example, and I suggest, of course, that you

19:01.880 --> 19:08.840
if someone just showed up at a meeting and said, hey, there is this kid drowning, but

19:08.840 --> 19:11.640
I didn't want to have wet clothes for this gathering.

19:11.640 --> 19:15.160
So I just let the kid drown and die.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.880
You would be horrified.

19:16.880 --> 19:21.280
You would think that this person was evil, that they had done an evil thing.

19:21.280 --> 19:26.400
You would not let your friends or family associate with this kind of person.

19:26.400 --> 19:31.320
Well, if you agree with Singer about this specific case, then Singer says, we should

19:31.320 --> 19:37.320
be able to abstract from this case to a more general principle, and you should hold this

19:37.320 --> 19:41.680
more general principle, and the more general principle is premise one of the argument.

19:41.680 --> 19:48.360
The idea is that, well, a child drowning in a pond, that's a very bad thing.

19:48.360 --> 19:52.600
But it's not bad because it has to do with water or children.

19:53.040 --> 19:58.840
An adult drowning and dying is also a bad thing, or even an adult dying by some other

19:58.840 --> 20:00.760
means is a bad thing.

20:00.760 --> 20:05.880
What's relevant here is not that it's a child or that it's a water-involving death.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.560
It's that this is an easily preventable death.

20:09.560 --> 20:14.880
The death is a bad thing, and the fact that your clothes would get muddy, that's a morally

20:14.880 --> 20:19.480
insignificant thing, but the fact that it's your clothes and it's mud, that doesn't matter

20:19.480 --> 20:22.040
if it's something else that you have to sacrifice.

20:22.040 --> 20:28.400
If, for example, instead of your clothes getting wet or muddy, your, I don't know, your car

20:28.400 --> 20:33.840
is going to get dirty, or you're going to lose your shoelaces, the shoelaces will be

20:33.840 --> 20:34.840
gone forever.

20:34.840 --> 20:38.440
You'll have to sacrifice your shoelaces, and you'll have to get whole new shoelaces,

20:38.440 --> 20:40.440
and that'll be kind of a pain in the butt.

20:40.440 --> 20:45.520
The point is this, the difference between one way of dying and another way of dying,

20:45.520 --> 20:49.960
or one morally insignificant sacrifice and another morally insignificant sacrifice, the

20:49.960 --> 20:51.680
difference between these doesn't matter.

20:51.680 --> 20:57.920
So you can go from a specific case like this to a general claim like one.

20:57.920 --> 21:03.560
And the thought is, if you agree with Singer about this specific case, then you have to

21:03.560 --> 21:07.160
accept premise one of the argument, okay?

21:07.160 --> 21:17.760
So there are two ways in which you might think you can't go from this example to this premise.

21:17.760 --> 21:22.320
Or another way to put this point is you might think that there are two big differences between

21:22.320 --> 21:28.240
this shallow pond example and the example of giving up your luxuries, the luxuries in

21:28.240 --> 21:32.480
your life, a new car, a cup of coffee, that sort of thing, a massage.

21:32.480 --> 21:36.640
There's a difference between this example and giving up those things to save someone

21:36.640 --> 21:38.000
from a famine.

21:38.000 --> 21:42.120
There's two ways in which there might be a relevant difference.

21:42.120 --> 21:46.280
These are the two relevant differences that Singer considers and responds to.

21:46.280 --> 21:47.280
Here they are.

21:47.280 --> 21:53.240
Okay, here's the first potentially relevant difference, proximity.

21:53.240 --> 21:57.240
In the shallow pond example, you're right next to the child.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.760
You're very close to this child.

21:59.760 --> 22:07.920
Whereas in your day-to-day life, you are not right next to, you're not near the people

22:07.920 --> 22:14.720
who are dying of famine or of whatever other very terrible things that organizations like

22:14.720 --> 22:16.280
Oxfam fight against.

22:16.280 --> 22:19.160
Well, is that a morally relevant difference?

22:19.160 --> 22:24.880
Is that a way in which we block this example from generalizing to something like premise

22:24.880 --> 22:26.080
one?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.840
Singer thinks no.

22:27.840 --> 22:34.280
It used to be that proximity made a significant moral difference because it used to be that

22:34.280 --> 22:39.920
a great distance prevented people from knowing about very bad things.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.720
It used to be that if there was some very bad thing happening on the other side of the

22:42.720 --> 22:47.920
world several hundred years ago, you could never know about that very bad thing or you

22:47.920 --> 22:51.960
couldn't find out about it for months or years.

22:51.960 --> 22:58.520
But now, now proximity is irrelevant to your knowledge of very bad things because there's

22:58.520 --> 23:01.400
very efficient forms of communication.

23:01.400 --> 23:07.880
You can know about a famine going on in another country while it's going on with enough time

23:07.880 --> 23:10.200
to do something about it.

23:10.200 --> 23:14.640
Proximity also used to be relevant before these organizations existed.

23:14.640 --> 23:21.280
It used to be the case that you weren't able to sacrifice some luxury in order to save

23:21.280 --> 23:27.160
someone from a famine because, well, it was very hard to get things across the world and

23:27.160 --> 23:32.200
there weren't organizations set up that had built very efficient systems for taking a

23:32.200 --> 23:38.080
few dollars from you and literally saving a person's life on the other side of the planet.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.680
So proximity used to matter.

23:40.680 --> 23:46.640
It used to be a morally relevant difference between the pond example and the famine example.

23:46.640 --> 23:51.440
But it's not anymore, says Singer.

23:51.440 --> 23:58.000
So this difference of proximity does not prevent your intuition, your thoughts, your moral

23:58.000 --> 24:05.840
thoughts about an example like this from translating over to a very general claim like one.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.120
Here's the other potential difference.

24:07.120 --> 24:13.200
If you're trying to block this example from getting the result ultimately that you have

24:13.200 --> 24:15.340
to give up all the luxuries in your life.

24:15.340 --> 24:20.620
You might say, look, in this shallow pond example, we're led to assume that there's

24:20.620 --> 24:22.580
no one else that could save the child.

24:22.580 --> 24:26.940
There are no others who are capable of saving the child.

24:26.940 --> 24:33.740
But in the case of famine relief, anyone could give money to Oxfam, right?

24:33.740 --> 24:38.420
There's all these other people present and the thought is, well, in the cases where there's

24:38.420 --> 24:40.940
all these other people present, it doesn't fall on you.

24:40.940 --> 24:48.500
You don't get the obligation to be the one who saves someone's life when they're dying

24:48.500 --> 24:49.500
of famine.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.820
Here's what Singer says in response to that.

24:51.820 --> 24:59.500
He says, look, the presence of others who could help is sort of relevant because their

24:59.500 --> 25:03.820
presence typically leads to their actually helping.

25:03.820 --> 25:08.060
Those other people actually helping prevent the very bad thing.

25:08.780 --> 25:15.620
If there were other people who saw the child drowning in the shallow pond, well, then very

25:15.620 --> 25:19.460
likely one of those other people would save the child and then you wouldn't have to save

25:19.460 --> 25:20.460
the child.

25:20.460 --> 25:26.620
If then you showed up at the meeting and said, hey, there was this kid drowning in the pond

25:26.620 --> 25:30.580
and whoever was going to go in and save the kid was going to get their clothes wet and

25:30.580 --> 25:33.220
someone says, your clothes aren't wet.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.300
Are you an evil monster?

25:35.300 --> 25:38.900
You say, no, no, no, there were other people there and someone else saved the kid.

25:38.900 --> 25:41.820
And they'd say, oh, okay, wow, that must have been something.

25:41.820 --> 25:45.380
Let's get on to our frappe party or whatever we were about to do.

25:45.380 --> 25:49.260
The point is, the presence of others is only relevant if those other people are going to

25:49.260 --> 25:50.580
do something.

25:50.580 --> 25:55.740
If they're not going to do anything, then it seems like, at least to Singer, the obligation

25:55.740 --> 25:56.900
is on you.

25:56.900 --> 26:01.580
If there's other people who are able to see that this child is drowning, but these other

26:01.580 --> 26:08.220
people care a great, great deal about getting their clothes wet or muddy and they're not

26:08.220 --> 26:14.460
going to step in to save the child and you know this and they say this to you, well,

26:14.460 --> 26:19.220
does the fact that they're there and they could save the child excuse you from your

26:19.220 --> 26:21.220
duty to save the child?

26:21.220 --> 26:22.220
No.

26:22.220 --> 26:26.340
If you show up at the meeting and you say, I was going to save this kid, but there were

26:26.340 --> 26:29.100
these other people there and they say, who saved the child?

26:29.100 --> 26:30.660
And you say, no one saved the child.

26:30.660 --> 26:31.660
The child drowned.

26:31.660 --> 26:33.820
The child is dead now.

26:33.820 --> 26:35.980
Everyone would say, you're a monster.

26:35.980 --> 26:36.980
You're an evil person.

26:36.980 --> 26:37.980
You should have saved the child.

26:37.980 --> 26:40.140
And you say, yeah, but there were other people there.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.140
It doesn't matter.

26:41.140 --> 26:42.820
The other people didn't do anything about it.

26:42.820 --> 26:45.580
So that means you have to do something about it.

26:45.580 --> 26:50.420
The fact that there are other people who could help in the case of famine, in the case of

26:50.420 --> 26:54.600
a drowning child is itself irrelevant.

26:54.600 --> 26:58.260
What matters is if someone else does help and then there's no more need for you because

26:58.260 --> 27:02.060
all the children have been saved or all the people have been saved from famine.

27:02.060 --> 27:08.340
A lot of people donate to organizations like Oxfam, some amount of money or other, but

27:08.340 --> 27:12.180
there's still plenty of people left who need to be saved.

27:12.180 --> 27:17.740
And so you have an obligation to them, according to Singer.

27:17.740 --> 27:22.940
The fact that there are other people who aren't helping also, that just seems totally irrelevant.

27:22.940 --> 27:24.500
Okay.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.860
A few ending notes.

27:26.860 --> 27:29.500
One, how much do we have to give?

27:29.500 --> 27:36.420
I mean, it's one thing to give up, you know, one cup of coffee, right, made at a fancy

27:36.420 --> 27:38.700
coffee place, right?

27:38.700 --> 27:43.300
But do I have to give up all the coffee that I might ever buy?

27:43.300 --> 27:48.500
Do I have to never buy coffee and never get a new car and never get new clothes?

27:48.500 --> 27:51.460
Am I allowed no luxuries at all?

27:51.460 --> 27:57.900
Do I have to give away so much of my money that I'm reduced to the level of the person

27:57.900 --> 28:02.340
who's suffering from this famine or near to that level?

28:02.340 --> 28:05.620
Singer says, maybe yes.

28:05.620 --> 28:08.940
He considers two versions of premise one, right?

28:08.940 --> 28:11.980
And this is more specific and it's in the paper.

28:11.980 --> 28:14.980
I think it happens on, where does it happen?

28:14.980 --> 28:17.180
It happens on page 231.

28:17.180 --> 28:21.380
He considers two versions of premise one a stronger principle and a weaker principle.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.340
And this is the weaker one, right?

28:23.340 --> 28:26.380
According to the weaker principle, you just have to give up some luxuries.

28:26.380 --> 28:30.540
You don't have to reduce yourself all the way down to the level that's near equivalent

28:30.540 --> 28:32.540
to the people that you're saving.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.580
But according to the stronger principle, you do.

28:34.580 --> 28:39.540
And Singer actually thinks this argument basically works for the stronger principle.

28:39.540 --> 28:41.100
You have to give up a lot.

28:41.100 --> 28:45.380
Here's an objection, an additional objection that Singer considers.

28:45.380 --> 28:50.900
He considers this on pages 236, 237, 238, if you're looking in the text.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.860
This is just too demanding.

28:52.860 --> 28:57.540
This is too much to ask for people to give up all these things.

28:57.540 --> 28:59.540
To that Singer says a couple things.

28:59.540 --> 29:08.620
One thing he says is, look, that is a standard, you know, objection to utilitarianism.

29:08.620 --> 29:12.780
And Singer is himself a utilitarian or at least he's a consequentialist.

29:12.780 --> 29:14.300
I can't remember.

29:14.300 --> 29:19.980
Anyway, he's close to a utilitarian and he could be for the purposes of this paper.

29:19.980 --> 29:25.060
So well, it's a standard objection against utilitarianism that it's too demanding.

29:25.060 --> 29:28.660
But Singer just thinks that this is a very weak objection.

29:28.660 --> 29:31.300
Maybe morality is very demanding.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.540
The argument seems to work.

29:33.540 --> 29:39.060
The fact that you don't like the conclusion, which is really what the too demanding objection

29:39.060 --> 29:45.700
comes to, the fact that you don't like the conclusion is not an argument that the conclusion

29:45.700 --> 29:46.820
is false.

29:46.820 --> 29:51.900
He considers another argument, this is on page 239, another argument that goes like

29:51.900 --> 29:52.900
this.

29:52.900 --> 30:01.860
If private individuals start donating money to famine relief, then governments will stop.

30:01.860 --> 30:07.020
And if governments stop donating money because the private individuals have got it taken

30:07.020 --> 30:10.260
care of, well then very bad things will result.

30:10.260 --> 30:14.900
There won't be enough money because the governments are the real source of the money or whatever.

30:14.900 --> 30:19.700
Another response to this, part of his response is to just say, don't worry about it.

30:19.700 --> 30:21.420
Not that many people are going to start giving.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.020
It's not going to prevent governments from donating money.

30:25.020 --> 30:26.780
Governments don't give that much money to begin with.

30:26.780 --> 30:33.860
And if you give every dollar that you have, that's not enough to affect how much governments

30:33.860 --> 30:34.860
give.

30:34.860 --> 30:37.580
You're not going to solve this problem on your own.

30:37.580 --> 30:42.340
And if your only objection is, hey, if I give all my money, I'll totally solve the problem.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.340
That's just a weak objection.

30:43.340 --> 30:45.220
Yes, you'll totally solve the problem.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.220
Good.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.220
Solve it.

30:47.220 --> 30:52.580
The last objection that Singer considers, this happens on page 240 in the reading, is

30:52.580 --> 30:58.060
the thought that, well look, if you donate all this money to famine relief, it's just

30:58.060 --> 30:59.980
famine relief.

30:59.980 --> 31:01.500
It's going to help these people.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.820
It's going to save their lives.

31:02.820 --> 31:06.740
Sure, but there'll be another famine in a few years from now.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.020
Maybe in that place, maybe in a different place.

31:09.020 --> 31:12.260
You're just postponing these famines.

31:12.260 --> 31:15.020
Singer says, no, you're not.

31:15.020 --> 31:18.500
Those famines are going to happen one way or another.

31:18.500 --> 31:24.660
And if you donate the money to help people who are dying of this famine today, and when

31:24.660 --> 31:30.380
he wrote this paper in 1972, there was a specific famine that he was talking about.

31:30.380 --> 31:36.140
If you donate the money, you will save these particular people's lives.

31:36.140 --> 31:41.220
And the fact that there's going to be more famines in the future, maybe that affect these

31:41.220 --> 31:45.140
people, maybe that affect other people, it just seems irrelevant.

31:45.140 --> 31:46.980
Think back to the shallow pond example.

31:46.980 --> 31:50.060
This child is drowning in the pond.

31:50.060 --> 31:53.740
You don't want to get your pants wet or muddy.

31:53.740 --> 31:58.380
So you say, well look, if I save this child now, then this child is probably just going

31:58.380 --> 32:01.940
to stumble into some other pond later and die anyway.

32:01.940 --> 32:04.740
You would seem absurdly callous.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.780
You would seem evil.

32:06.780 --> 32:08.860
Singer says you would be evil.

32:08.860 --> 32:13.740
And if you don't donate all of this money that you spent on luxuries, then you are evil.

32:13.740 --> 32:15.620
That's what Singer says.

32:15.620 --> 32:23.700
Okay, so I think we can agree that the conclusion of this argument is radical.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.500
It's wild.

32:25.500 --> 32:33.860
It seems to show that everyone that you know is a terrible person, is roughly as terrible

32:33.860 --> 32:40.660
as someone who would let a child drown and die because they didn't want to get their

32:40.660 --> 32:42.740
clothes muddy.

32:42.740 --> 32:45.060
That's what the argument seems to show.

32:45.060 --> 32:47.060
That's a new thing.

32:47.060 --> 32:51.820
You probably don't think that you and your family are evil.

32:51.820 --> 32:55.100
But the argument seems to show that.

32:55.100 --> 33:01.180
It's a very radical conclusion and the problem is it's very hard to see what's wrong with

33:01.180 --> 33:02.580
the argument.

33:02.580 --> 33:05.580
The argument seems like a good one.

33:05.580 --> 33:11.300
And it has seemed that way to everyone who read this paper since 1972.

33:11.300 --> 33:17.260
There are responses to it and there are philosophers who try very hard and have very clever, careful

33:17.260 --> 33:21.700
things to say to try to show that this argument doesn't actually work.

33:21.700 --> 33:27.140
But at least until we get to read some of those arguments, you should try to see if there's

33:27.140 --> 33:29.140
anything wrong with this argument yourself.

33:32.580 --> 33:44.100
Peter Singer, by the way.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.100
He's still alive.

33:45.100 --> 33:46.100
I met him.

33:46.100 --> 33:47.100
We had dinner once.

33:47.100 --> 33:48.100
He gave a talk and then I...

33:48.100 --> 33:49.100
Anyway, I know him.

33:49.100 --> 33:50.600
I know celebrities.
