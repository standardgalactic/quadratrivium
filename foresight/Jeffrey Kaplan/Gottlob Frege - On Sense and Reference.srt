1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
This guy, Gottlob Frege, published this paper

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,240
Ã¼ber Sinn und Bedeutung on Sense and Reference in 1892.

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,640
And it is the most important paper in the history of the philosophy of language.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:17,360
It is very complicated, but I'm going to explain it now.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,160
Frege realizes that linguistic terms, words, have to have two levels of meaning.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,720
They each have to have a sense and a reference.

7
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,960
I'm going to explain exactly what those are,

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,520
but first we need to see the puzzle that forces Frege into this position.

9
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,360
To illustrate this puzzle, I'm going to have you watch like a viral video.

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:14,320
Okay, that was fun.

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,320
The noteworthy thing about this interaction is that the woman, her name is Ellen,

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,520
she already knows the meaning of the name Jay-Z.

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,160
So it's not like what happens is that the guy tells her,

14
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,400
oh, there's this name Jay-Z and the name refers to me.

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,040
It's my name.

16
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:31,920
That's not what happens.

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,760
No, no, she's familiar with the name.

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,280
She knows the meaning of Jay-Z,

19
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,480
but she still learns something at the end of the video

20
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,560
when he tells her that he is Jay-Z.

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,000
So there's like two possibilities.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,200
She could learn something linguistic about the name,

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,520
or she could learn something empirical.

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,920
Empirical just means knowable by observation or experience.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,240
Another term for this is a posteriori.

26
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
And the point of this story is just that what this woman learns

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,120
at the end of the conversation is not linguistic.

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,160
She's not learning anything about the meaning of the name Jay-Z.

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,360
She already knew that name.

30
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,520
She's learning an empirical fact, a fact about the world,

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,440
which is, oh, this guy that I've been sitting next to, he is Jay-Z.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,680
Consider these two sentences.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,040
Sean Carter is Sean Carter and Sean Carter is Jay-Z.

34
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,600
That's Jay-Z's government name, his regular name.

35
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,040
Sean Carter, that's his name.

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,240
Sentences of this type are called identity statements

37
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,120
because they say that two things are one thing.

38
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,160
Two things are identical.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,520
They're the very same thing.

40
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,680
Imagine in the case of Ellen and Jay-Z on the subway,

41
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,320
imagine that she knew him by the name Sean Carter.

42
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,920
Like maybe he got on the train

43
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,320
and they introduced themselves to each other

44
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,720
and he introduced himself as Sean Carter.

45
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,600
That's his name.

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,200
She knows who Sean Carter is

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,880
and she also knows that there's this musician,

48
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,560
this rapper named Jay-Z.

49
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe she's seen pictures of him.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
She knows who Jay-Z is.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,160
But she hasn't yet put it together in her mind

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,160
that this guy right next to her, Sean Carter, is Jay-Z.

53
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,520
If that's the case,

54
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,160
then sentence number two can be informative to her.

55
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,360
It has, as Frege says, cognitive value.

56
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,240
You can really learn something from sentence number two.

57
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,720
This woman, Ellen, can really learn something

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,040
by discovering or being told that Sean Carter is Jay-Z.

59
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,120
So I'm writing here that sentence two is informative.

60
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,320
It can teach her something in the way that sentence one never could.

61
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,840
Sean Carter is Sean Carter.

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,200
Yes, of course.

63
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,840
As long as these two names, here and here,

64
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,720
are being used in the same sense to mean the same thing,

65
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
well then one is totally banal and uninformative,

66
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,000
whereas two can be informative.

67
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,840
But sentence two can also be empirical

68
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,800
in the sense that the information that you get from sentence two

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,240
can be, in some cases, not about language,

70
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,920
not about the meanings of the words,

71
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,160
but it can be something that has to be discovered

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,640
through going out into the world and existing

73
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,480
and discovering things like, namely,

74
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,280
oh, this guy sitting next to me, he's a famous rapper.

75
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,800
That's the point of this example.

76
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,640
In the middle of the train ride,

77
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,440
Ellen knows all the linguistic facts.

78
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,040
She knows what this name, Sean Carter, means.

79
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,560
She knows who it refers to.

80
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,240
It refers to this guy sitting next to me.

81
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,520
She also is familiar with and understands the name Jay-Z.

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,840
She knows, oh, that's the name for this famous musician.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,320
Maybe she can name a whole bunch of facts about Jay-Z.

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
She can know all the linguistic facts,

85
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,200
but still there's that moment at the end of the train ride

86
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,000
where she learns something like sentence two.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,960
She learns that this guy, Sean Carter, is Jay-Z.

88
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,920
And so what she learns can't be linguistic

89
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,680
because she already knew the linguistic stuff.

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,200
It has to be some empirical fact about the real world,

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,760
some observable experiential fact.

92
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
Now we're ready to state the puzzle.

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,280
How can we have a theory of language, a theory of names,

94
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,640
that explains these two features of sentence number two,

95
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,480
that it can be informative,

96
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,720
and then more specifically, the kind of information

97
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,240
that it can give can be empirical information.

98
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,640
The reason this is a puzzle is that there was this other theory

99
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,720
of names published in 1881 by John Stuart Mill

100
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,480
and according to Mill's theory,

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,480
the meaning of a proper name like Sean Carter or Jay-Z,

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,880
the meaning of a name like that is nothing more

103
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,320
than the object named.

104
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,560
And Mill's theory sounds really good

105
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,280
when you read that paper that he published in 1881,

106
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,280
but then you run into cases like this

107
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,480
and he can't handle this.

108
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
According to Mill, the name Sean Carter

109
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,600
and the name Jay-Z mean exactly the same thing.

110
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
And so sentence one and sentence two are no different.

111
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
Mill is unable to explain why a sentence like two

112
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,160
can be genuinely illuminating, informative,

113
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,240
why it can have some cognitive value

114
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
in a way that a sentence like one doesn't.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,320
Because after all, on Mill's theory,

116
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,520
the meaning of these letters right here is just the dude

117
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,280
and the meaning of these letters right here

118
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,480
is the exact same dude.

119
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,680
So it's just this dude is this dude.

120
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
Yeah, duh, just like in this case, this dude is this dude.

121
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,320
There's no difference.

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,720
Now there's an alternative to Mill's theory

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,600
that can explain how sentence two

124
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
can be illuminating, informative,

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,160
in a way that sentence one can't.

126
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,680
And that theory translates sentence two

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,880
as a sentence about language itself.

128
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,000
On this theory, sentence two is really just shorthand

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,240
for something like sentence two star.

130
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,120
The name Sean Carter and the name Jay-Z denote the same person.

131
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,560
If this is what two means,

132
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,840
then it makes sense why two is informative

133
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,200
in a way that one isn't.

134
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,440
One would be translated correspondingly

135
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
as something like the name Sean Carter

136
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,320
and the name Sean Carter denote the same person.

137
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,280
That's obvious.

138
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,560
But this is not obvious.

139
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,040
Like this is a fact that you might not know.

140
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,120
And this theory that translates identity statements like this

141
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,600
into sort of linguistic statements like this,

142
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,560
that theory is actually Fraga's old theory

143
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,080
from the Begriff Schrift, which he published in 1879.

144
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,840
But 13 years went by between 1879 and 1892

145
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,760
when he published On Sense and Reference.

146
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,520
And during those 13 years, Fraga realized that this theory,

147
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,600
the theory that translates identity statements

148
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,760
into linguistic statements like this,

149
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,360
that theory wasn't good.

150
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,960
And the reason is that statements like number two here

151
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
can be informative, not just informative,

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,040
but empirically informative.

153
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,080
The idea is simply that when Ellen had this moment

154
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,680
of realization on the subway,

155
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,560
she wasn't realizing something about the meanings

156
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,040
of these terms, she was realizing something

157
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,320
about the world around her.

158
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,280
And Fraga gets this.

159
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,920
He understands all this stuff about Ellen and Jay-Z.

160
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,320
And so what he does in On Sense and Reference

161
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,640
is he tosses out his old theory

162
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,200
and he gives a new theory of sentences like that.

163
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,640
And it turns out to be not just a theory of identity statements

164
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
like this, but of all of language.

165
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,240
Very quickly, I'm going to illustrate this again

166
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,760
with Fraga's own example,

167
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,040
which involves the morning star and the evening star.

168
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,680
To understand this,

169
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,880
you're going to need some astronomical background information.

170
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,760
So here it is.

171
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,440
If you look at the sunrise, just before sunrise,

172
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,480
right near where the sun is about to rise,

173
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,960
you can see a very bright star, sometimes.

174
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,520
And the name of that star is the morning star.

175
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,480
And then also just after sunset,

176
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,200
right near where the sun just set,

177
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,160
sometimes you can see this other bright star

178
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,720
and that star is called the evening star.

179
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,960
Okay, those are stars and people have known

180
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,480
about these stars for a long time

181
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,960
and they name the stars because we name things.

182
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,280
But then at some point, someone discovered

183
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,320
that these two stars were the exact same thing.

184
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,840
And they're not even stars.

185
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,240
It turns out they are the planet Venus.

186
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,840
So what you've got are sort of trivial sentences

187
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,480
like the morning star is the morning star.

188
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,600
Yeah, duh.

189
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,720
And then you've got possibly very informative,

190
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,640
noteworthy sentences like the morning star is the evening star.

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,120
So just like in the case of this sentence too,

192
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,960
this sentence too can be informative.

193
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,600
And the kind of information that this sentence carries

194
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,680
is not linguistic information,

195
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,280
but empirical astronomical information.

196
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,560
Someone can be in a situation

197
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
where they know the meaning of this name

198
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
or this phrase or whatever the morning star.

199
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,520
They know which star it is.

200
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,480
They can even point to it.

201
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,400
They can even say that one's the morning star.

202
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,600
That's the object denoted by the name

203
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,920
or the description, the morning star.

204
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
And they can do the same thing, let's suppose,

205
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,880
for the evening star.

206
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
They know what this phrase means

207
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,960
and they can point to it.

208
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,160
So they know what is denoted by all of these terms,

209
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
but what they don't know

210
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,640
is that these two objects are one object.

211
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,240
And so when you tell someone

212
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
the morning star is the evening star,

213
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,240
you can be telling them something

214
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,680
that they didn't know already

215
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,600
and not something linguistic at all.

216
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,520
And Mill's theory of names

217
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,600
and Frago's old theory of names

218
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
that translates identity statements

219
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,800
into these linguistic statements or whatever,

220
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,240
neither of those theories

221
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,640
can explain these facts about this sentence and this sentence.

222
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,760
That they are informative

223
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,080
and that the kind of information that they can give

224
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,000
is often empirical.

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,680
Okay, so that's the puzzle.

226
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,560
That's the problem.

227
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,000
And what Frago does

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
is he solves this problem

229
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,440
by introducing an additional layer of meaning.

230
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,080
And that sort of additional middle layer

231
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,880
of the meaning of a term is the sense.

232
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,000
It is natural now

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,320
to think of their being connected with a sign,

234
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,400
a name, combination of words, letter,

235
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,800
besides that to which the sign refers,

236
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
which may be called the referent of the sign.

237
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,680
Also, what I would like to call the sense of the sign,

238
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
wherein the mode of presentation is contained.

239
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay, so Frago is talking about three different things.

240
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
The first thing is the name or the sign.

241
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,760
And then of course,

242
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,480
there's the thing that the name picks out

243
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
or refers to the referent,

244
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,120
which in this case, the referent is the guy,

245
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,560
the actual person, Jay-Z.

246
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,360
But in addition to the referent,

247
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,680
Frago is saying that there's this other

248
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,440
middle level of meaning,

249
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,880
which he calls the sense.

250
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,680
And it's really not clear at this point in the paper

251
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,960
what the sense of a name or of any expression is,

252
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,680
but it has something to do with a mode of presentation.

253
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,280
So I have to explain what that is.

254
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,920
Are you familiar with the concept of a McMansion?

255
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,480
That's like a poorly constructed ugly home

256
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,320
with too many roof lines or whatever.

257
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,400
Imagine one of these ugly houses.

258
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,760
And in the front of the house,

259
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,600
there's like fancy stonework or bricks or columns

260
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,560
or something like that.

261
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
But in the back of the house, it's just plastic siding.

262
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,800
So you can imagine a case

263
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,960
where you've seen this house from the front.

264
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,520
That's one way of viewing the house,

265
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,720
one literal angle or perspective

266
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
from which you can view the house.

267
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,400
You might also see the house from the back.

268
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,320
That's a different perspective,

269
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,880
a different mode of presentation of the house,

270
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,760
a different way that the house could be presented to you.

271
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,880
And you can know the house in both of these ways

272
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,200
without actually knowing that they're the same house.

273
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
And then it might be informative to you to find out,

274
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,840
oh, look at that, that's the same one house.

275
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,280
That's what Frege is getting at

276
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,120
with this idea of a mode of presentation.

277
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,880
There are two different ways of knowing Sean Carter.

278
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,600
You could know him as the kid from Brooklyn or whatever.

279
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,800
Or you could know him as Jay-Z, the mogul,

280
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,120
the billionaire rapper or whatever.

281
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
I don't know if he has a billion dollars,

282
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,000
but close to a billion or a little more, I think.

283
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,880
The simplest way, although this is a little contentious,

284
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,240
to think of the sense or mode of presentation

285
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,840
of a name or phrase is to think of it as a description.

286
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,840
You could describe this guy as a billionaire music mogul

287
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,520
or you could describe him as a middle-aged man

288
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,960
who was born in Brooklyn

289
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,760
and still lives most of the time in the greater New York area.

290
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,880
Those are two different ways of presenting

291
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,280
or characterizing this guy, Sean Carter or Jay-Z.

292
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,040
Frege's point is this.

293
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,400
A name, or for that matter, any other linguistic term,

294
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,640
a name has not only this level of meaning,

295
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,800
which is the object named,

296
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,720
but also the way that that object is characterized

297
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
or presented by the sign, by the name.

298
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,640
Frege himself actually explains this,

299
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,520
though with a somewhat abstract mathematical example

300
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,640
that might not have been obvious from just reading the text.

301
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,440
So I'm going to read it and then explain exactly what he means.

302
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,680
Let ABC be the lines connecting the vertices of a triangle

303
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,760
with the midpoints of the opposite sides.

304
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,760
Okay, so there's no actual diagram in the published paper,

305
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,320
but I created this diagram.

306
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,880
You see that inside of this triangle, there are three lines.

307
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,360
There's the vertical line, which is called A,

308
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,080
and then there's this other line, that's line B,

309
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,400
and then line C is the third line

310
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,080
going from the lower right to the upper left.

311
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,520
And the important thing to notice

312
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,840
is that all three of these lines intersect,

313
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,360
they cross each other or meet at the very same point in the middle.

314
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,840
The point of intersection of A and B

315
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,280
is then the same as the point of intersection of B and C.

316
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,400
So there's just one point here in the middle of this diagram,

317
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,040
but Frege mentions at least two different ways

318
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
of describing that exact same point,

319
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,000
the place where lines A and B intersect,

320
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,160
or you could describe the very same point

321
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,200
as the place where lines B and C intersect.

322
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,040
So we have different designations

323
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,240
for the same point.

324
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
And these names, point of intersection of A and B,

325
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,960
point of intersection of B and C,

326
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,840
likewise indicate the mode of presentation.

327
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,240
So these two different names for the one point,

328
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,960
the point of intersection of A and B,

329
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,520
and the point of intersection of C and D,

330
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,760
these two names, they pick out the same point,

331
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,120
but they present that point in different ways.

332
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,320
They involve different modes of presentation

333
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,680
of that same point.

334
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,480
And hence, the statement contains true knowledge.

335
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,160
What he means by that is just that

336
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,840
because these two different names for that one point

337
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,400
have different modes of presentation,

338
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,720
that sentence, the sentence that

339
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,280
the point of intersection of A and B

340
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,560
is the same as the point of intersection of B and C,

341
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,360
that sentence, like sentence two here,

342
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,400
can contain real genuine information,

343
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,320
true knowledge, as Frege calls it.

344
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,080
In our example, accordingly,

345
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,760
the reference of the expressions

346
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,600
the point of intersection of A and B

347
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,840
and the point of intersection of B and C

348
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,320
would be the same, but not their senses.

349
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Right, so these two names have the same referent,

350
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
but different senses,

351
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
different ways of presenting that referent.

352
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,360
That's exactly what's going on with Sean Carter and Jay-Z.

353
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,040
These two names, they refer to the same guy,

354
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,480
they have the same referent,

355
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,320
but they have different senses.

356
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,880
They present him in different ways.

357
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
And it's the same way with the example

358
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
of the morning star and the evening star.

359
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
The referent of evening star would be the same

360
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,840
as that of morning star, but not the sense.

361
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,520
So those two names, the morning star and the evening star,

362
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,280
they have the same referent,

363
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,640
which happens to be Venus,

364
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,360
but they present that referent differently.

365
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,600
They make reference to Venus via different senses.

366
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,240
And this theory, this theory that says

367
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
that for all the linguistic signs,

368
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,400
there are two levels of meaning,

369
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,640
the level of sense and the level of reference.

370
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,160
This theory can explain both of these facts

371
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
about identity statements like two.

372
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,200
It can explain why these sentences are informative

373
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,280
and it can explain why that information

374
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,520
can be non-linguistic and empirical.

375
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,200
It's possible for one to already know

376
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,360
the linguistic information.

377
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,040
One knows the sense of Sean Carter, the meaning.

378
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,360
And one knows the sense of the term or name Jay-Z.

379
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,080
But then one can find out, oh!

380
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,040
Oh!

381
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,080
These two terms that I already know the meaning to,

382
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,320
they refer to the very same guy.

383
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
That is how Frege solves the puzzle.

384
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,560
Oh, but there's more, there's like way more.

385
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,280
The regular connection between a sign, its sense

386
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,200
and its referent is of such a kind

387
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,080
that to the sign, there corresponds a definite sense

388
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,560
and to that, in turn, a definite referent.

389
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,880
The point Frege is making there is just that

390
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,200
in the normal case, for one name, there is one sense

391
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,000
and then one referent, one to one to one.

392
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,560
While to a given referent, an object,

393
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,040
there does not belong only a single sign.

394
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,480
But if instead we start with the object, the referent,

395
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,600
there might be more than one name for that object, right?

396
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,640
There might be Jay-Z and Sean Carter and Hove.

397
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,480
That's another one, I think.

398
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
The same sense has different expressions

399
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,280
in different languages or even in the same language.

400
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,880
Okay, this is an additional point,

401
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,920
but Frege thinks that the same sense

402
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,480
can be the meaning of different terms.

403
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,600
It might be, I'm sort of playing a little fast

404
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,200
and loose here, but it might be that Jay-Z

405
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,640
and Hove, H-O-V, I'm pretty sure that's how it's spelled,

406
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,240
those are two different names,

407
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,560
but maybe they present him in the same way.

408
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,600
So they have the same sense, two different names,

409
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
same sense, same referent.

410
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,120
That's also possible, Frege thinks.

411
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,680
And then there's the case of what are today

412
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,520
commonly called empty names.

413
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
These are names that are meaningful,

414
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
but they don't refer to anything.

415
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,960
It may perhaps be granted that every grammatically

416
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,920
well-formed expression representing a proper name

417
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,520
always has a sense.

418
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,400
This just means that if a name is meaningful,

419
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,520
it has a sense.

420
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,920
But this is not to say that to the sense,

421
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,840
there also corresponds a referent.

422
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,200
But just because a name is meaningful and has a sense

423
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,920
doesn't mean that there really is an object in the world

424
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,480
that is referred to by that name.

425
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,280
Frege is going to give us an example right now.

426
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,720
The words, the celestial body most distant from the earth

427
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
have a sense, but it is very doubtful

428
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,080
if they also have a referent.

429
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,840
The phrase, the celestial body most distant from the earth,

430
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,000
that's a perfectly meaningful label,

431
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
it's a definite description, it has a meaning.

432
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,480
Frege just thinks, and I think he's probably right,

433
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,240
that there is no object in space that is the one object

434
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
that is the farthest away from the earth.

435
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,360
Maybe because like space curves or I don't know,

436
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,000
but there might not be a thing out in the world

437
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,280
that's referred to in that way,

438
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,000
but nonetheless, the name can be meaningful.

439
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,560
Here's another thing that's very important to Frege.

440
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,120
It's important that the sense of a term is public.

441
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,480
Different people can mean the same thing by a term,

442
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
and so they have to be able to share the sense.

443
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,440
And for that reason, the sense of a term,

444
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,000
the mode of presentation contained in the name,

445
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,840
blah, blah, blah, all of that,

446
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,000
that's not the same as some private mental thing,

447
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,640
some conception or image in your mind.

448
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,160
It can't be that because that thing in your mind is private.

449
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,240
No one else can see your conception can have it.

450
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,040
And so whatever private stuff is going on in there,

451
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,840
that can't be what Frege means by sense.

452
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,840
The referent and sense of a sign

453
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,960
are to be distinguished from the associated conception.

454
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,760
The associated conception is whatever shows up in someone's mind

455
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,640
when they hear this name, and Frege is saying,

456
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
that is not the sense, and that's not the referent,

457
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,880
that's some other thing.

458
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,120
This constitutes an essential distinction

459
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,520
between the conception and the sign's sense,

460
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
which may be the common property of many,

461
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,280
and therefore is not part or a mode of the individual mind.

462
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,640
Frege's point there is simply

463
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,840
that the sense of a term is common property.

464
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,680
It's something that multiple people can share.

465
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,600
And you can see why Frege thinks this.

466
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,880
The sense is the meaning of the name,

467
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,000
and he wants two different people to mean the exact same thing.

468
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,640
If the meaning of a name was some private thing

469
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,080
inside your own mind,

470
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
then you could never mean the exact same thing

471
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,160
by a term as someone else.

472
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,880
This wasn't in the part of this paper that I've assigned,

473
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,280
but Frege also thinks that the sense of a name or a term

474
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,720
determines the referent.

475
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,880
That is, why is this referent the referent of this name, right?

476
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,200
Why is Jay-Z the name of this guy?

477
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,160
Oh, well, it's because there's some description,

478
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,120
there's some characterization,

479
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,360
there's some mode of presentation of this guy

480
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,800
that's associated with the name,

481
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,280
and he meets that description.

482
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
He fits that mode of presentation.

483
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
Frege thinks something like that.

484
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,400
Also, there's this famous telescope analogy

485
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
that explains how all of these things are related,

486
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,960
and I'm gonna use this in my picture of that.

487
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,440
That's a pretty good drawing.

488
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
Let's read the quote and figure out what Frege is saying.

489
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,320
Somebody observes the moon through a telescope.

490
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,640
I compare the moon itself to the referent.

491
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,240
It is the object of the observation mediated by the real image

492
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,840
projected by the object glass in the interior of the telescope

493
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,000
and by the retinal image of the observer.

494
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,160
The former, I compare to the sense,

495
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,120
the latter to the conception or experience.

496
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,480
Okay, so there's a person who's looking through a telescope

497
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,840
and they see the moon,

498
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,400
and there's three things involved here.

499
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,400
There's the moon, there's the image of the moon

500
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,600
on the piece of glass inside the telescope,

501
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,120
and then there's the image on the inside of the person's eye

502
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,000
on their retina.

503
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,920
That's like the back of the eye or something.

504
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,200
There's the image that is reflected inside their eyeball.

505
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,560
The moon is analogous to the referent.

506
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,880
It's the object out there in the world.

507
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,680
The image on the inside of the telescope

508
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,920
is analogous to the sense, right?

509
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
Because a sense is a public thing,

510
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,840
and different people could come

511
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:50,960
and look through the telescope

512
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,520
and they would see the very same image

513
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,120
on the glass inside the telescope.

514
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,480
It's not the object out there,

515
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,840
but it's still something public

516
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
that different people can interact with.

517
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,280
It's common property.

518
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,080
And then there's the image on a person's retina.

519
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
That is analogous to the conception,

520
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,360
the mental conception.

521
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
That's a totally private thing.

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,480
Only you can see the images on the back of your retina.

523
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,240
No one else can come and look at those.

524
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,600
The purpose of this analogy

525
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,920
is just to explain how all of these things,

526
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,280
the referent, the sense,

527
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,600
and the conception are related to one another.

528
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,080
Frege actually doesn't care about mental stuff,

529
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,320
like your associated mental conception

530
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,760
or experience or whatever.

531
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
This is irrelevant really.

532
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,080
When he's talking about the meanings of terms,

533
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,720
he's just talking about the sense and the reference.

534
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,000
But he has to mention all of this stuff about conception

535
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
just so that his readers don't accidentally

536
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,120
or mistakenly think that when he talks about sense,

537
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
he's talking about some private mental thing,

538
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,680
he's clarifying that that's not what he's talking about.

539
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,960
Okay, now things get real.

540
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,360
Up to this point,

541
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
we've only been talking about names

542
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,440
or maybe subject expressions,

543
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:57,760
whatever.

544
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,080
We weren't talking about whole sentences.

545
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,520
Now, Frege is going to start talking about the sense

546
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,200
and the reference of whole sentences,

547
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,560
like Sean Carter is rich or Jay-Z is rich.

548
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,560
The thing you have to absolutely understand

549
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,360
in order to understand what happens in this part of the paper

550
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,600
is the idea of compositionality.

551
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,560
I have a whole other video explaining compositionality

552
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,920
and if you haven't watched that,

553
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,160
you got to go watch it, link in the description.

554
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,800
But very briefly, the idea is this.

555
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,480
The meaning of a whole sentence is composed of

556
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,560
or built up out of the meanings of the individual parts.

557
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,760
So the meaning of this sentence, Jay-Z is rich,

558
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,720
is made up out of the meaning of Jay-Z,

559
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
the meaning of is, and the meaning of rich.

560
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
You put those together,

561
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,360
there's some rules for that,

562
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,440
and you get the meaning of the whole sentence.

563
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,120
This is a fact about language,

564
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,440
and Frege takes it very seriously.

565
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,160
He thinks that compositionality is operating

566
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,200
at both the level of sense and reference.

567
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,040
If terms, if linguistic terms have sort of two levels of meaning,

568
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,840
they have the level of sense and the level of reference,

569
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:08,800
then those, the sense bits are all going to add up together

570
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,680
to give you the sense of a whole sentence.

571
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,120
And also, all the references are going to add up together

572
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,520
to give you the reference of a whole sentence.

573
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,840
So what he's trying to do in this part of the paper,

574
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,040
the middle of the paper,

575
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,640
is he's trying to figure out,

576
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,880
okay, I've already basically said

577
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,080
what the sense and reference of like a name is,

578
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,800
what's the sense and reference of a whole sentence?

579
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,320
And he's constrained in his answer to that question

580
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,760
by compositionality.

581
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,040
The only thing that could be the sense of a sentence

582
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,280
is something that could be made up out of

583
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,320
the senses of those individual words or terms.

584
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,240
And the only thing that could be the reference

585
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,080
of a whole sentence is something

586
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,920
that could be made up out of

587
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,200
the references of all the individual words or terms.

588
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
The first thing that Frege considers

589
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,840
as a possible sense or reference

590
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,920
of a whole declarative sentence

591
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,240
is what today we call a proposition.

592
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
Frege doesn't call it a proposition,

593
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,600
he calls it a thought.

594
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,200
Now, that's confusing because normally

595
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,080
when you think of thought,

596
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,760
you think of a private mental thing,

597
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,680
and that's not what Frege is talking about here.

598
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,200
When he says thought,

599
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,160
he means the publicly available meaning of a sentence.

600
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,320
Is this thought now to be regarded

601
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
as its sense or its reference?

602
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,680
So the question is,

603
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:27,520
is the proposition or the thought associated with a sentence,

604
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,360
is that the sense of the sentence

605
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,360
or the reference of the sentence?

606
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,120
Let us assume for the time being

607
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,720
that the sentence has a reference.

608
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
If we now replace one word of the sentence by another,

609
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,800
having the same reference,

610
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,160
but a different sense,

611
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,760
this can have no influence

612
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,440
upon the reference of the sentence.

613
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,240
Ah, so Frege has found a little test

614
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,240
to tell whether the proposition

615
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,680
or the thought or whatever

616
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,920
is the sense of the sentence or the reference.

617
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,480
He realizes that there are these terms,

618
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,160
Sean Carter and Jay-Z,

619
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,080
which have different senses,

620
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,200
but the same reference.

621
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,280
And so if you switch between the two,

622
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,920
if you swap out this name,

623
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,880
Sean Carter,

624
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,960
and you put in this name Jay-Z

625
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
into the same sentence,

626
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,840
that's the difference between three and four,

627
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,280
if you swap them out

628
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,240
because these two names have the same reference,

629
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,600
then switching between these two sentences

630
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,320
should not change the reference of the whole sentence,

631
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,800
but it should change at least sometimes

632
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,560
the sense of these sentences.

633
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,160
We're just switching out two terms.

634
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,560
We're going from a term with one sense

635
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,920
to a term with a different sense.

636
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,360
So these two sentences

637
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,960
should have different senses.

638
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,320
But because these two names have the same reference,

639
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,040
these two sentences should have the same reference.

640
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,880
Frege is trying to figure out

641
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,560
whether or not the proposition

642
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,280
or the thought expressed by a sentence

643
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,880
is the sense or the reference.

644
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
Well, there's this constraint.

645
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,040
These two sentences

646
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,680
will have different senses,

647
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,600
but the same reference.

648
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Yet we can see that in such a case,

649
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,600
the thought changes.

650
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,480
Frege notices that these two sentences

651
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,800
express different propositions.

652
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,480
They express different thoughts.

653
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,320
So the thought cannot be the reference of a name

654
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,560
because the thought changes between these two,

655
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,080
but the reference can't change

656
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,600
because this name has the same reference as this name,

657
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,360
this has the same reference as this.

658
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,280
These are referentially the same.

659
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,880
So if something changes,

660
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,840
if the thought changes,

661
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,680
then the thought has to be the sense,

662
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,880
not the reference.

663
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,160
The thought, accordingly,

664
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,240
cannot be the reference of the sentence,

665
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
but must rather be considered as the sense.

666
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,160
Okay, so having figured out

667
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,160
what the sense of a whole sentence is,

668
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,080
it's the proposition expressed by that sentence,

669
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,160
the next question is, well, what's the reference?

670
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,560
What is the reference of a declarative sentence

671
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,240
like this or like this?

672
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,600
Sean Carter is rich.

673
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,560
Jay-Z is rich.

674
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,400
We know what these names refer to.

675
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,000
They refer to the guy.

676
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,080
What do the whole sentences refer to?

677
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,760
And once again, when figuring this out,

678
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,320
Frege is constrained by compositionality.

679
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,560
Whatever this thing the reference is,

680
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,920
it's gonna have to somehow be built up out of

681
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,320
the references of all the individual parts.

682
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,640
And this gives Frege an argument

683
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,760
for why the reference of a declarative sentence like this

684
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,840
is that sentence's truth value.

685
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,200
The truth value of a declarative sentence

686
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,520
is just whether or not the sentence is true or false.

687
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,280
There's two possible truth values.

688
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,680
True is one of them, false is the other.

689
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
You know, this sentence, Jay-Z is rich.

690
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,400
That's true.

691
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,080
Its truth value is true.

692
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,160
So Frege thinks that this whole sentence

693
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,520
refers to truth or the true.

694
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,880
That's what it refers to.

695
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,880
Okay, weird, but he has an argument

696
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,200
for why he thinks this has to be the case.

697
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,680
The reference of a whole declarative sentence

698
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,440
has to be composed up

699
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,840
out of the references of the individual parts.

700
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,920
Therefore, any change in the reference

701
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,600
of any of the individual parts

702
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,200
must result in a change in the reference of the whole sentence.

703
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,520
And whenever there is not a change

704
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
in the reference of the individual parts,

705
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,680
like when switching between three and four,

706
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,600
the references of all of these parts,

707
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,080
this name, this, this, this name, this, this,

708
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,320
the references of all this stays the same

709
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,760
when you switch from three to four.

710
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,920
So the reference of these whole sentences

711
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
has to stay the same.

712
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,280
Therefore, whatever the references

713
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,040
of these declarative sentences are,

714
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,240
they have to be the same.

715
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,280
These two sentences have to have the same reference

716
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,840
because all of their parts have the same reference

717
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,000
because Sean Carter and Jay-Z

718
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,400
are two different names with the same reference.

719
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,520
These two names are what's called co-referring terms.

720
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,040
Co-referring terms.

721
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,400
Co-referring terms.

722
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,160
They refer to the same thing.

723
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,880
And so this test that Frege has come up with is,

724
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,240
oh, well, if you swap out one term

725
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,560
for another term that's co-referring,

726
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,280
right, if you go from sentence three to sentence four,

727
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,800
if you do this swap,

728
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,120
you have to always preserve

729
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,720
the reference of the whole sentence.

730
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,040
So then the question for Frege is very simple.

731
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,280
What is something about these sentences

732
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,360
that always stays the same

733
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
whenever you swap out co-referring terms?

734
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,080
Whenever you go from a sentence like three

735
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,520
to a sentence like four,

736
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,760
what stays the same every time?

737
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,280
Well, it's not the thought.

738
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,120
It's not the cognitive value.

739
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,160
The thought changes.

740
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,760
That's the sense and that changes.

741
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,040
It's the truth value.

742
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,800
Whenever you swap in a different name for this guy,

743
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,440
the resulting sentence will always have

744
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,080
the same truth value as these two.

745
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,960
And there it is, hove.

746
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,000
Hove is rich.

747
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,200
That's true as well.

748
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,680
This is true, this is true, and this is true.

749
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,920
You're never gonna be able to get a sentence

750
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,560
that just switches in a co-referring term here

751
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,480
and all of a sudden that sentence is false

752
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,000
whereas all of these remain true.

753
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,120
You're never gonna get that

754
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,920
because the truth value always stays the same

755
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
when you swap in co-referring terms

756
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,360
and that is Frege's argument

757
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,160
for why the truth value of a declarative sentence

758
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,400
is the reference of that sentence.

759
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,360
And the same would hold if these sentences were false, right?

760
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,080
If instead of saying Sean Carter is rich,

761
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,800
this sentence said Sean Carter is enshrined

762
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,040
in the country music hall of fame,

763
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,720
well then three would be false

764
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,120
but then the same sentence where you swap in Jay-Z,

765
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,560
that would also be false.

766
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,080
Hove would also be false.

767
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,280
Any sentence that is false of Sean Carter

768
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,160
is also false of Jay-Z, is also false of Hove.

769
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,120
Swapping out these names with different senses

770
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,560
but the same reference changes the thought or proposition

771
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,640
but never changes the truth value.

772
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,240
At least that's true in the case

773
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,840
of simple sentences like this.

774
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,480
More complex sentences with like quotations

775
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,920
and things like that, this won't work

776
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,760
but we're not gonna worry about that now.

777
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,960
Let's just read Frege's argument for this conclusion.

778
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,280
If our supposition that the reference of a sentence

779
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,200
is its truth value is correct,

780
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,960
the latter, that is the truth value,

781
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,640
must remain unchanged

782
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,480
when a part of the sentence is replaced

783
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,800
by an expression having the same reference

784
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,400
and this is in fact the case.

785
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,720
Right, cool, that's just what we were saying.

786
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,000
Leibniz explains,

787
00:32:52,960 --> 00:33:00,080
That's my best shot pronouncing the Latin.

788
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,120
It means equal are those which for each other

789
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,920
mutually substituted can be saving the truth.

790
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,400
And what that means in comprehensible English

791
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,000
is just that what it is to say

792
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,840
that two things are the same thing

793
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,080
is that every sentence that's true of one

794
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,040
is true of the other.

795
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,360
What else but the truth value could be found

796
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,840
that belongs quite generally to every sentence

797
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,000
concerned with the reference of its components

798
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,240
and remains unchanged by substitutions

799
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,200
of the kind in question.

800
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,320
Frege is asking what could it be that stays the same

801
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,400
when you keep doing this substituting

802
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,760
other than the truth value

803
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,520
and the implied answer to this question

804
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,880
though he doesn't say it in the paper,

805
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,320
the implied answer is nothing.

806
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,920
There's nothing other than the truth value

807
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,440
that fits this role

808
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,240
and therefore the truth value of a declarative sentence

809
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,600
has to be its reference.

810
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,720
Okay, those are all the major claims in the paper.

811
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
There's a whole bunch of other weird grammatical stuff

812
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,760
in the second half of the paper,

813
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,360
but no one ever talks about that

814
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,760
and I'm not assigning that to my students.

815
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,760
So this video is done.
