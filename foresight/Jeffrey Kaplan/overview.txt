Checking Jeffrey Kaplan/A.J. Ayer's Emotivist Theory of Moral Language.txt
 Ayer's theory of moral language argues that when we engage in moral debates, we are essentially agreeing on a negative sentiment towards certain actions (behavior type T) that we all agree are undesirable, such as behavior that leads to murder. In the context of the example provided, if someone like Jeff Sessions believes marijuana should be illegal because it's morally wrong, he would claim that smoking marijuana is a subset of behaviors (behavior type A) that fall under this broader category (behavior type T) of actions leading to undesirable outcomes.

Ayer's theory explains that when we have moral disagreements, we are actually disagreeing on factual matters that underpin our moral sentiments. In the case of marijuana, the factual claim would be that smoking marijuana leads to murder, which is a non-moral, empirical statement. This approach allows moral skeptics to maintain that moral language is meaningful and not simply false or pointless, even if they deny the existence of objective morality. Moral talk is a way for us to express disapproval based on shared negative sentiments towards certain actions without asserting the truth of moral claims themselves. Thus, Ayer's theory provides a framework for understanding moral discourse as a form of language game that does not necessarily rely on the existence of objective moral values or duties.

Checking Jeffrey Kaplan/Gottlob Frege - On Sense and Reference.txt
1. **Reference and Truth Value**: Frege argues that the reference of a proper name or definite description is the object it denotes, whereas the sense is the mode of presentation of that object. He also claims that the truth value of a sentence is what makes it true or false, and this truth value is the reference of the entire sentence.

2. **Co-Referential Terms**: When we replace co-referential terms (terms that denote the same object) in declarative sentences, the truth value remains unchanged. This is because the thought or proposition might change due to different senses being involved, but not the truth value.

3. **Frege's Argument for Truth Value as Reference**: Frege's argument hinges on the observation that when we swap out co-referential terms in a sentence, the resulting sentence maintains the same truth value as the original sentence. This leads to the conclusion that the reference of a declarative sentence is its truth value.

4. **Leibniz's Law**: Frege draws upon Leibniz's Law, which states that if two expressions are co-referential (i.e., refer to the same object), anything that is true of one of these expressions is also true of the other. This law supports Frege's contention that truth value is the reference of a sentence.

5. **Implications of Truth Value as Reference**: If Frege is correct, and the reference of a sentence is its truth value, then for any given declarative sentence, there are only two possible references: true or false. This means that every declarative sentence is either true or false, with no middle ground.

6. **Limitations**: While Frege's argument applies to simple declarative sentences, it does not hold for more complex sentences involving quotations or other linguistic structures where the distinction between sense and reference becomes more nuanced.

7. **Frege's Impact**: Frege's paper is significant because it establishes a philosophical foundation for the idea that logical truths are to be understood as having their references in the realm of truth values, which paves the way for formal logic and mathematical proofs.

In summary, Frege's argument leads to the conclusion that the reference of a declarative sentence is its truth value, which remains consistent even when co-referential terms are substituted within the sentence. This has profound implications for how we understand the nature of truth in logical and mathematical statements.

Checking Jeffrey Kaplan/Peter Singer - ordinary people are evil.txt
1. **Utilitarianism Critique**: The objection that utilitarianism is "too demanding" is considered weak by Peter Singer. He argues that if our moral system requires us to prevent suffering whenever we can, it would be unreasonable to reject it just because its demands are high.

2. **Government vs. Individual Donations**: Singer addresses a concern that individual donations could potentially reduce government funding for famine relief, leading to insufficient aid. He dismisses this worry by suggesting that individuals' contributions won't significantly impact the amount governments contribute, which is typically more substantial than what individuals can provide.

3. **Temporary Relief**: Singer refutes the claim that donating money now will only postpone future famines. He argues that while future famines may occur, the people currently in need are saved by your actions today, and it is morally imperative to address present suffering rather than waiting for a potentially different situation in the future.

4. **Radical Conclusion**: Singer's argument suggests that most people, including those close to you, might be considered "evil" under this utilitarian framework because they are not donating as much as possible to alleviate suffering, especially when compared to the example of a child drowning in a pond where inaction would be morally indefensible.

5. **Philosophical Debate**: Singer's argument is radical and has been influential since it was first presented in 1972. It has prompted significant debate among philosophers who have variously tried to refute or modify his position, but the simplicity and apparent logical coherence of his argument have made a strong impact on moral philosophy.

6. **Peter Singer's Influence**: Peter Singer is a living philosopher whose work has had a profound effect on discussions about effective altruism and ethical decision-making regarding global poverty and suffering. His views are not universally accepted, but they have sparked important conversations in moral philosophy.
