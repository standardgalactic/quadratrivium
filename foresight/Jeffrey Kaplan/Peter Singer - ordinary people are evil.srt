1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
It's a very radical conclusion, and the problem is it's very hard to see what's wrong with

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,940
the argument.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,860
The argument seems like a good one, and it has seemed that way to everyone who read this

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:16,900
paper since 1972.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:23,660
Today we're talking about an absolutely revolutionary paper published by a philosopher

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,680
named Peter Singer in 1972.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,640
The name of the paper is Famine Affluence and Morality.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:42,840
And the basic idea is that the moral stance that you have, your attitude towards your

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,320
moral obligations and the things that you may or may not do in your life, and the attitude

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,080
that all of your friends and all of your relatives have, the general moral outlook that everyone

11
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,760
around you has, is deeply and profoundly wrong.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:08,120
And the crazy thing about this paper is that, on the surface at least, it's very persuasive.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,080
He seems, Singer, seems to be right.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,720
It seems to be, once you go through the argument that he lays out, it seems to be that we need

15
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,760
to completely rework our entire society.

16
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,920
And more specifically, forget about society for a minute.

17
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,480
You need to completely rework your life if your life is going to be a moral one.

18
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:39,000
And sort of what makes the paper so radical is that I can say all of these things, that

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,360
the thesis of the paper is that you need to completely rework your life without knowing

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,080
anything about you.

21
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,880
I know virtually nothing about your life and your moral outlook and your values and the

22
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,800
kinds of things that you do on a day-to-day basis.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:59,160
I can basically make some assumptions about my audience, general assumptions.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,880
You live in a broadly capitalistic society, let's assume.

25
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,960
There are government regulations and that sort of thing.

26
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,960
And you live sometime in the beginning-ish of the 21st century.

27
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,440
That's basically enough.

28
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:21,080
If that's true of you, then Singer thinks that your whole life needs to be reworked

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,480
if you're going to live in a morally acceptable way.

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,240
Okay, if we're going to understand this argument, then we need one distinction to start out.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,000
This is a technical distinction, but there's really only one technical term.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
Here you go.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,960
We're talking about the distinction between the super-erogatory and the obligatory.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,040
Imagine this, you're getting together with a group of friends or coworkers or something

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,760
like that and you decide, you know what, this is a pretty early gathering.

36
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,480
It's a pretty early meeting.

37
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,120
And so wouldn't it be nice if I went and got everyone some coffee and danishes because

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,040
some people are going to be rushing out of their house and they're not going to have

39
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,400
time to eat breakfast.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,520
And so when everyone shows up, surprise, surprise, there is some coffee and donuts and treats

41
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,200
or whatever that you brought for everyone and you paid for and you're just giving it

42
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,160
to them and you say, hey guys, I brought these for you.

43
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,880
I want you to have them.

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,640
That act, that action is super-erogatory.

45
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,720
It's extra.

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,040
It's super.

47
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,920
You didn't have to do it, but it was a really nice thing to do.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,800
It was an extra thing that you did and it was a good thing to do.

49
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,520
It was not obligatory.

50
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,200
Something is obligatory if you have to do it.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,960
So if someone is assigned in the group to bring coffee and breakfast to every early

52
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,320
morning meeting and you signed up, you promised, you committed to bringing coffee and breakfast

53
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,200
on that day, well then bringing coffee and breakfast is obligatory.

54
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,440
And of course it would be nice if everyone thanked you for bringing those things even

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,760
if you agreed or promised to do it.

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,000
It wasn't extra.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,200
It was something you had to do.

58
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
You had committed to it.

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,000
You were obliged to do it.

60
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,040
One more example just to bring out this distinction.

61
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,960
And this example may date this video.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,600
It may give you a sense of when I'm making this video, but anyway, at the time of the

63
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,360
recording of this video, there's something going on in supermarkets where when you check

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,280
out in the supermarket and you're paying for your groceries or whatever, well there's

65
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,280
some of the payment is obligatory.

66
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,040
You have to pay for the things that you are buying, but then there's this extra payment.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,360
They say when you're checking out, they're like, would you like to donate $1 to and then

68
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,680
they name some charity?

69
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,760
Would you like to add $1 to your bill here at the supermarket?

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,120
That additional payment, that's extra.

71
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,680
You don't have to do it.

72
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,680
It's up to you.

73
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,080
It's super-erogatory.

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,760
If you do do it, it's good.

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,400
That's a nice thing that you did, right?

76
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,600
But you didn't have to.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Super-erogatory.

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
That's what that word means.

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,680
Okay, here's the claim of this paper.

80
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,280
The claim is that there are these organizations that exist in the world now.

81
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,600
Now in 1972, says Singer.

82
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,160
These organizations like Oxfam and UNICEF, these are organizations that take money from

83
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,360
people who live in relatively wealthy places on the planet.

84
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,000
They take that money and they use it to do amazing things for people who are suffering

85
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,520
under things like famines.

86
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,640
If there's a famine in some place in the world, there's not enough food and people are literally

87
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,560
starving to death.

88
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,840
They are dying because they don't have enough food.

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,000
So someone donates a little bit of money and these organizations take that money and a

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,320
very high percentage of that money with a great deal of efficiency gets transported to

91
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,640
this other place on the planet where there's a famine and literal people's lives are saved.

92
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:00,240
Normally we, you and I and all of your relatives and all of your friends, everyone in our society

93
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:06,440
and our broader society, we think of these sorts of acts, giving charity in this way,

94
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,240
giving money to Oxfam or UNICEF or whatever.

95
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,720
We think of these things as supererogatory.

96
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,000
Giving to charity is supererogatory.

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,600
It's nice, it's good, but you don't have to do it.

98
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,800
If on any given occasion you don't do it, you're not a bad person, it's not like you

99
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,880
failed to live up to some obligation that you had.

100
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,960
The writer says, no, here's an argument that proves, Singer thinks, that giving to charity,

101
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:41,560
giving extra money to famine relief, if you're affluent, if you have extra money, is something

102
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
that you must do.

103
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:50,280
You must do it in the same way that you must not murder or you must catch someone.

104
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,680
If they're falling and you can just reach out your arms and catch them and save them,

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,200
you must do it.

106
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
That's the thesis.

107
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:02,360
Okay, so Singer has an argument for this thesis, an argument for this conclusion, but we're

108
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,480
going to get to the argument in one minute.

109
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,800
First let's just skip to the end of the paper and see his statement of that conclusion.

110
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,000
Here's what he says.

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,800
Here's what Singer says, because giving money is regarded as an act of charity, it is not

112
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,280
thought that there is anything wrong with not giving.

113
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,120
The charitable man, or if we want, because this was written in 1972, we can say the charitable

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
person.

115
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,880
The charitable person may be praised, but the person who is not charitable is not condemned.

116
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,120
People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new clothes or a new

117
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,280
car instead of giving it to famine relief.

118
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,320
Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.

119
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
What's the alternative?

120
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,400
The alternative is not getting those new clothes and not getting that new car and instead taking

121
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,080
that money that you would have spent on new clothes and just, well, wearing your old clothes

122
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,160
and taking that money and giving it to an organization that will help people, that will

123
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,240
save people who are dying of famine.

124
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,680
That possibility, the possibility of not spending money on luxuries, does not occur

125
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,760
to most people or to virtually anyone.

126
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:20,300
This way of looking at the matter cannot be justified.

127
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,380
This way of looking at the matter is the way that we all look at the matter.

128
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,900
That is, we think that giving money to famine relief is super erogatory.

129
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,900
It's nice.

130
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,260
It's an extra thing that cannot be justified.

131
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,940
The only thing, according to Singer, that can be justified, and we're going to get to

132
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,660
the argument for this conclusion, the only thing that can be justified is the way of

133
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:47,620
thinking where you think that giving to famine relief instead of buying new clothes or a new

134
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,660
car or whatever, giving to famine relief is obligatory.

135
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,500
That's the only way of thinking that can be justified.

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,020
The upshot or the punchline is this.

137
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:04,900
If you don't give to famine relief, Singer thinks, you've done something wrong.

138
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:09,540
You've done something evil, bad.

139
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:16,660
Every time you buy new clothes that you don't absolutely need or you buy a new car when you

140
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:24,020
could just drive your old car or you buy a cup of coffee that someone else made for you

141
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,580
because it's more convenient for them to make it for you and it tastes a little better than

142
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,260
if you were to make it at home.

143
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,180
Every time you do any of those things, you're doing something wrong.

144
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,820
You're doing something bad.

145
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,820
We don't think this way.

146
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,420
No one in our society, not in 1972 and even though this is a super famous paper, you've

147
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:46,520
maybe never heard of it and so it didn't seep into the whole society even now, right?

148
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,640
People don't think that buying new clothes or buying a cup of coffee from a coffee shop

149
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,880
is a bad thing to do, an evil thing to do, a wrong thing to do, but Singer thinks that

150
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,480
it is and here's his argument for that conclusion.

151
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:06,720
Okay, here's the argument.

152
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,840
Singer doesn't lay out the argument like this with four premises and one conclusion or anything.

153
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm pulling these out of the paper, but this is indeed the argument.

154
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,760
Here's how it goes.

155
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Let's take it one step at a time.

156
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,800
One, if it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening without thereby sacrificing

157
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,860
anything of moral significance, then we must morally do it.

158
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,840
That is, prevent that very bad thing from happening.

159
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,160
Okay, that's premise one.

160
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,840
I'll just give you a hint.

161
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,600
This is going to be the most controversial claim, right?

162
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,440
It's a very general claim.

163
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,400
It's talking about very bad things.

164
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,000
It's got this big category of very bad things and then it's got this other category of things

165
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,800
that you might sacrifice that are not of moral significance.

166
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,800
That's another big category.

167
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,120
It's a big grand claim about what you must do morally and it's a very general claim.

168
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,040
So one is going to be the most controversial claim in this argument.

169
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,480
So we'll come back to this.

170
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,880
If you're looking for this claim, by the way, in the reading, then go to page 235.

171
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:18,240
There's one big paragraph in the middle of page 235 and this claim happens, not phrased

172
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,200
exactly like this, but basically like this, at the sort of end of that paragraph.

173
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,680
Anyway, let's keep going.

174
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:32,640
Step two, hunger, disease, and other sources of suffering, disability, and death are very

175
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
bad.

176
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,680
Okay, those are some examples of very bad things.

177
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:43,240
We see how this is going to connect up with the first premise, right?

178
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,600
We've got a bunch of very bad things and it's said in the first premise that if it's in

179
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,800
your power or if it's in our power to prevent something very bad, well then we've got to

180
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
do that thing.

181
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,800
We've got to prevent those things.

182
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,120
So these are going to be the things that we're going to need to prevent this argument's

183
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
going to claim.

184
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,960
It's just specifying some very bad things.

185
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,960
And premise two, by the way, seems totally plausible.

186
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:15,880
Hunger, disease, and other sources of suffering, disability, and death are very bad.

187
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,400
Yes, that's plausible.

188
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Hunger is very bad.

189
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,440
Real hunger, where someone doesn't have enough food to eat.

190
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,000
And disease.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,000
And other things that cause people to suffer or become disabled or die.

192
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
All of that is bad.

193
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Yep, okay.

194
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Good job.

195
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,240
Premise two, very plausible.

196
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,320
Premise three, the luxuries on which we spend money are not of moral significance.

197
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,600
So the kinds of luxuries he's talking about are these luxuries, right?

198
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
Buying new clothes.

199
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,440
When your old clothes, although out of fashion or a little tattered or whatever, are perfectly

200
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,440
good.

201
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,960
Or buying a new car.

202
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,480
When your old car, although not as good as a new car, is still a good enough car, right?

203
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,600
The example that I gave earlier, buying a cup of coffee when you could make the coffee

204
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
at home.

205
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,280
Really going to any restaurant ever, right, counts as a luxury in this sense.

206
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,440
I mean, you can always just, for less money, make food at home.

207
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:22,160
This connects with the idea of moral significance or of some things not being of moral significance,

208
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,660
right?

209
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,360
Sacrificing anything of moral significance.

210
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,160
That's part of the first premise also.

211
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:33,440
So premise three is specifying the kinds of things that aren't of moral significance.

212
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,160
And once we understand what singer means by luxuries, he's right.

213
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,200
These things are not of moral significance.

214
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
They're not a big deal.

215
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,920
If you go without them, you're not really worse off.

216
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:53,720
Four, by donating money to relief agencies like Oxfam, we could prevent hunger, disease,

217
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,880
and other sources of suffering, disability, and death.

218
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,520
Well, that's just saying that there's a very specific way, an easy way, right?

219
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:09,120
To prevent these things which premise two established were very bad.

220
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,640
Premise four, is it true?

221
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,760
By donating money to relief agencies like Oxfam, we could prevent hunger, disease, and

222
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,160
other sources of suffering, disability, and death.

223
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,120
Yes, premise four is true.

224
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,520
This is true.

225
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,120
These organizations do do this.

226
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,720
You can give them the money and then they will prevent these things.

227
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,160
Yes, premise four is just an empirical claim.

228
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,920
It's just a claim about whether these organizations actually do the thing that they say they're

229
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
going to do.

230
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,800
And the answer is yes, they do do it.

231
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay, and then here's the conclusion.

232
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,680
And we've already reached this conclusion.

233
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
We've already talked through this conclusion.

234
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,160
Therefore, we must, must, where is it?

235
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Where is it?

236
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
Must.

237
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
We are obligated.

238
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
It's not super erogatory.

239
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,360
It's not extra.

240
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,480
This is something you have to do.

241
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,960
And so the conclusion gets us something you have to do.

242
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,920
We must morally donate the money that we spend on luxuries to relief agencies.

243
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,760
And we don't get to spend them on luxuries.

244
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,160
This is the argument.

245
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,840
Okay, so now is a good time to reemphasize how radical this conclusion is.

246
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,480
We're about to assess the argument.

247
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,520
We're really going to focus almost entirely on premise one because premise one is the

248
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,760
only controversial premise in the argument.

249
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,760
Everything else.

250
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,760
Steps two, three, and four.

251
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,880
I mean, these just seem to be obviously correct, obviously true statements.

252
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,440
And the argument is, is valid.

253
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,040
So well, one is the only option that we could argue against, and we're going to try to argue

254
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
against it.

255
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,000
And Singer is going to say no, and none of those arguments work.

256
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,720
Okay, but focusing again on the conclusion for a minute before we get back to premise

257
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,880
one, this is pretty radical.

258
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,240
No one thinks that we have a moral obligation, no one, none of your friends, none of your

259
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:57,280
family think that you must not buy a cup of coffee.

260
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,040
You must not buy a new car.

261
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,440
You must not buy new clothes.

262
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:07,720
Instead, you must take all of that money and donate it to some organization like Oxfam.

263
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,280
One of these relief agencies.

264
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,160
No one lives their life like this, or very few people.

265
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,600
Peter Singer, by the way, he's still alive.

266
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,760
I met him, right?

267
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
We had dinner once.

268
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
He gave a talk.

269
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,760
And then I...

270
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,760
Anyway, I know him.

271
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,760
I know celebrities.

272
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,920
Peter Singer, who's still alive, kind of lives his life like this.

273
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,240
He donates a very significant, non-truvial portion of his income, which is not enormous.

274
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,440
It's not an enormous income to relief agencies.

275
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,840
He does this.

276
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,320
He does not live a luxurious life, not a life that we would normally call luxurious.

277
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,280
Okay, so there's one.

278
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,460
And then maybe there's, I don't know, a few of his friends who he convinced.

279
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,780
But most people don't live their life like this.

280
00:16:50,780 --> 00:17:01,500
The conclusion of this paper is that most people, you included, are doing something bad every

281
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,140
day.

282
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,780
And you don't even realize it.

283
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:09,220
Okay, enough about how radical this conclusion is or whatever and how much it departs from

284
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,580
your day-to-day life.

285
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,580
Let's get to premise one.

286
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,380
This is the controversial premise.

287
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:18,460
What does Singer say to support such a broad sweeping claim?

288
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,220
Here's what he says.

289
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:30,300
This is a rather famous example that Singer gives to support premise one.

290
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
Here it is.

291
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,260
If I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in

292
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,300
and pull the child out.

293
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,840
This will mean getting my clothes muddy.

294
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,520
But this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad

295
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,020
thing.

296
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,120
Okay, got the example, right?

297
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,920
There's a shallow pond or a fountain.

298
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,520
When I teach this class on campus, every college campus, including the one where I work in

299
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,440
North Carolina, every college campus has like a fountain somewhere, right?

300
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
There's a fountain there.

301
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:10,580
A small child is drowning in the fountain and will die.

302
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,440
You are walking by.

303
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,280
You can easily step in and save the child.

304
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,240
The cost to you will be just a few moments and, well, your clothes are going to get wet

305
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,560
or muddy, right?

306
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,760
Muddy if it's a pond or wet, if it's a fountain or whatever.

307
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,840
This sacrifice, by the way, is not of moral significance, right?

308
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,800
It is insignificant that your clothes are going to get a little wet.

309
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,720
Oh, and you're on your way to something where you didn't want your clothes to be wet.

310
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,040
Okay, that's not a very significant sacrifice.

311
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:51,520
But the death of the child, the drowning death of the child in almost all circumstances would

312
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,640
be a very bad thing.

313
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,720
Well, the thought is go from this example.

314
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,160
If you agree with what Singer says about this example, and I suggest, of course, that you

315
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:08,840
if someone just showed up at a meeting and said, hey, there is this kid drowning, but

316
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,640
I didn't want to have wet clothes for this gathering.

317
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,160
So I just let the kid drown and die.

318
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,880
You would be horrified.

319
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,280
You would think that this person was evil, that they had done an evil thing.

320
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,400
You would not let your friends or family associate with this kind of person.

321
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,320
Well, if you agree with Singer about this specific case, then Singer says, we should

322
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:37,320
be able to abstract from this case to a more general principle, and you should hold this

323
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:41,680
more general principle, and the more general principle is premise one of the argument.

324
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:48,360
The idea is that, well, a child drowning in a pond, that's a very bad thing.

325
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:52,600
But it's not bad because it has to do with water or children.

326
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:58,840
An adult drowning and dying is also a bad thing, or even an adult dying by some other

327
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,760
means is a bad thing.

328
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,880
What's relevant here is not that it's a child or that it's a water-involving death.

329
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,560
It's that this is an easily preventable death.

330
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,880
The death is a bad thing, and the fact that your clothes would get muddy, that's a morally

331
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,480
insignificant thing, but the fact that it's your clothes and it's mud, that doesn't matter

332
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,040
if it's something else that you have to sacrifice.

333
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:28,400
If, for example, instead of your clothes getting wet or muddy, your, I don't know, your car

334
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,840
is going to get dirty, or you're going to lose your shoelaces, the shoelaces will be

335
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
gone forever.

336
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,440
You'll have to sacrifice your shoelaces, and you'll have to get whole new shoelaces,

337
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
and that'll be kind of a pain in the butt.

338
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,520
The point is this, the difference between one way of dying and another way of dying,

339
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,960
or one morally insignificant sacrifice and another morally insignificant sacrifice, the

340
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,680
difference between these doesn't matter.

341
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:57,920
So you can go from a specific case like this to a general claim like one.

342
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,560
And the thought is, if you agree with Singer about this specific case, then you have to

343
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:07,160
accept premise one of the argument, okay?

344
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:17,760
So there are two ways in which you might think you can't go from this example to this premise.

345
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,320
Or another way to put this point is you might think that there are two big differences between

346
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,240
this shallow pond example and the example of giving up your luxuries, the luxuries in

347
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,480
your life, a new car, a cup of coffee, that sort of thing, a massage.

348
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,640
There's a difference between this example and giving up those things to save someone

349
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,000
from a famine.

350
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,120
There's two ways in which there might be a relevant difference.

351
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,280
These are the two relevant differences that Singer considers and responds to.

352
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,280
Here they are.

353
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,240
Okay, here's the first potentially relevant difference, proximity.

354
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,240
In the shallow pond example, you're right next to the child.

355
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,760
You're very close to this child.

356
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,920
Whereas in your day-to-day life, you are not right next to, you're not near the people

357
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:14,720
who are dying of famine or of whatever other very terrible things that organizations like

358
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,280
Oxfam fight against.

359
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,160
Well, is that a morally relevant difference?

360
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,880
Is that a way in which we block this example from generalizing to something like premise

361
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,080
one?

362
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,840
Singer thinks no.

363
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,280
It used to be that proximity made a significant moral difference because it used to be that

364
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,920
a great distance prevented people from knowing about very bad things.

365
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,720
It used to be that if there was some very bad thing happening on the other side of the

366
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,920
world several hundred years ago, you could never know about that very bad thing or you

367
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,960
couldn't find out about it for months or years.

368
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:58,520
But now, now proximity is irrelevant to your knowledge of very bad things because there's

369
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,400
very efficient forms of communication.

370
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,880
You can know about a famine going on in another country while it's going on with enough time

371
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,200
to do something about it.

372
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,640
Proximity also used to be relevant before these organizations existed.

373
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,280
It used to be the case that you weren't able to sacrifice some luxury in order to save

374
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,160
someone from a famine because, well, it was very hard to get things across the world and

375
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,200
there weren't organizations set up that had built very efficient systems for taking a

376
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:38,080
few dollars from you and literally saving a person's life on the other side of the planet.

377
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,680
So proximity used to matter.

378
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:46,640
It used to be a morally relevant difference between the pond example and the famine example.

379
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,440
But it's not anymore, says Singer.

380
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:58,000
So this difference of proximity does not prevent your intuition, your thoughts, your moral

381
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,840
thoughts about an example like this from translating over to a very general claim like one.

382
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,120
Here's the other potential difference.

383
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,200
If you're trying to block this example from getting the result ultimately that you have

384
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,340
to give up all the luxuries in your life.

385
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,620
You might say, look, in this shallow pond example, we're led to assume that there's

386
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,580
no one else that could save the child.

387
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,940
There are no others who are capable of saving the child.

388
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,740
But in the case of famine relief, anyone could give money to Oxfam, right?

389
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,420
There's all these other people present and the thought is, well, in the cases where there's

390
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,940
all these other people present, it doesn't fall on you.

391
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:48,500
You don't get the obligation to be the one who saves someone's life when they're dying

392
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,500
of famine.

393
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,820
Here's what Singer says in response to that.

394
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:59,500
He says, look, the presence of others who could help is sort of relevant because their

395
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:03,820
presence typically leads to their actually helping.

396
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:08,060
Those other people actually helping prevent the very bad thing.

397
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:15,620
If there were other people who saw the child drowning in the shallow pond, well, then very

398
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,460
likely one of those other people would save the child and then you wouldn't have to save

399
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,460
the child.

400
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,620
If then you showed up at the meeting and said, hey, there was this kid drowning in the pond

401
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,580
and whoever was going to go in and save the kid was going to get their clothes wet and

402
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:33,220
someone says, your clothes aren't wet.

403
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,300
Are you an evil monster?

404
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,900
You say, no, no, no, there were other people there and someone else saved the kid.

405
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,820
And they'd say, oh, okay, wow, that must have been something.

406
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:45,380
Let's get on to our frappe party or whatever we were about to do.

407
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:49,260
The point is, the presence of others is only relevant if those other people are going to

408
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,580
do something.

409
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,740
If they're not going to do anything, then it seems like, at least to Singer, the obligation

410
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,900
is on you.

411
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,580
If there's other people who are able to see that this child is drowning, but these other

412
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:08,220
people care a great, great deal about getting their clothes wet or muddy and they're not

413
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:14,460
going to step in to save the child and you know this and they say this to you, well,

414
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,220
does the fact that they're there and they could save the child excuse you from your

415
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
duty to save the child?

416
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,220
No.

417
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,340
If you show up at the meeting and you say, I was going to save this kid, but there were

418
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,100
these other people there and they say, who saved the child?

419
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,660
And you say, no one saved the child.

420
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
The child drowned.

421
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,820
The child is dead now.

422
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,980
Everyone would say, you're a monster.

423
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,980
You're an evil person.

424
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
You should have saved the child.

425
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,140
And you say, yeah, but there were other people there.

426
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
It doesn't matter.

427
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,820
The other people didn't do anything about it.

428
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,580
So that means you have to do something about it.

429
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:50,420
The fact that there are other people who could help in the case of famine, in the case of

430
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,600
a drowning child is itself irrelevant.

431
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,260
What matters is if someone else does help and then there's no more need for you because

432
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,060
all the children have been saved or all the people have been saved from famine.

433
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:08,340
A lot of people donate to organizations like Oxfam, some amount of money or other, but

434
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,180
there's still plenty of people left who need to be saved.

435
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:17,740
And so you have an obligation to them, according to Singer.

436
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,940
The fact that there are other people who aren't helping also, that just seems totally irrelevant.

437
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,500
Okay.

438
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,860
A few ending notes.

439
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:29,500
One, how much do we have to give?

440
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:36,420
I mean, it's one thing to give up, you know, one cup of coffee, right, made at a fancy

441
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,700
coffee place, right?

442
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,300
But do I have to give up all the coffee that I might ever buy?

443
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:48,500
Do I have to never buy coffee and never get a new car and never get new clothes?

444
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,460
Am I allowed no luxuries at all?

445
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:57,900
Do I have to give away so much of my money that I'm reduced to the level of the person

446
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,340
who's suffering from this famine or near to that level?

447
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,620
Singer says, maybe yes.

448
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,940
He considers two versions of premise one, right?

449
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,980
And this is more specific and it's in the paper.

450
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,980
I think it happens on, where does it happen?

451
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,180
It happens on page 231.

452
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,380
He considers two versions of premise one a stronger principle and a weaker principle.

453
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:23,340
And this is the weaker one, right?

454
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,380
According to the weaker principle, you just have to give up some luxuries.

455
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:30,540
You don't have to reduce yourself all the way down to the level that's near equivalent

456
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,540
to the people that you're saving.

457
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,580
But according to the stronger principle, you do.

458
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,540
And Singer actually thinks this argument basically works for the stronger principle.

459
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,100
You have to give up a lot.

460
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,380
Here's an objection, an additional objection that Singer considers.

461
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:50,900
He considers this on pages 236, 237, 238, if you're looking in the text.

462
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,860
This is just too demanding.

463
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:57,540
This is too much to ask for people to give up all these things.

464
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,540
To that Singer says a couple things.

465
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:08,620
One thing he says is, look, that is a standard, you know, objection to utilitarianism.

466
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:12,780
And Singer is himself a utilitarian or at least he's a consequentialist.

467
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,300
I can't remember.

468
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,980
Anyway, he's close to a utilitarian and he could be for the purposes of this paper.

469
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,060
So well, it's a standard objection against utilitarianism that it's too demanding.

470
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,660
But Singer just thinks that this is a very weak objection.

471
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,300
Maybe morality is very demanding.

472
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,540
The argument seems to work.

473
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:39,060
The fact that you don't like the conclusion, which is really what the too demanding objection

474
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:45,700
comes to, the fact that you don't like the conclusion is not an argument that the conclusion

475
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,820
is false.

476
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,900
He considers another argument, this is on page 239, another argument that goes like

477
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,900
this.

478
00:29:52,900 --> 00:30:01,860
If private individuals start donating money to famine relief, then governments will stop.

479
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,020
And if governments stop donating money because the private individuals have got it taken

480
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:10,260
care of, well then very bad things will result.

481
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,900
There won't be enough money because the governments are the real source of the money or whatever.

482
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,700
Another response to this, part of his response is to just say, don't worry about it.

483
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,420
Not that many people are going to start giving.

484
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,020
It's not going to prevent governments from donating money.

485
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,780
Governments don't give that much money to begin with.

486
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:33,860
And if you give every dollar that you have, that's not enough to affect how much governments

487
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,860
give.

488
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,580
You're not going to solve this problem on your own.

489
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,340
And if your only objection is, hey, if I give all my money, I'll totally solve the problem.

490
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
That's just a weak objection.

491
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,220
Yes, you'll totally solve the problem.

492
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,220
Good.

493
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Solve it.

494
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,580
The last objection that Singer considers, this happens on page 240 in the reading, is

495
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:58,060
the thought that, well look, if you donate all this money to famine relief, it's just

496
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,980
famine relief.

497
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,500
It's going to help these people.

498
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,820
It's going to save their lives.

499
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,740
Sure, but there'll be another famine in a few years from now.

500
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:09,020
Maybe in that place, maybe in a different place.

501
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:12,260
You're just postponing these famines.

502
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,020
Singer says, no, you're not.

503
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,500
Those famines are going to happen one way or another.

504
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:24,660
And if you donate the money to help people who are dying of this famine today, and when

505
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:30,380
he wrote this paper in 1972, there was a specific famine that he was talking about.

506
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,140
If you donate the money, you will save these particular people's lives.

507
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,220
And the fact that there's going to be more famines in the future, maybe that affect these

508
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,140
people, maybe that affect other people, it just seems irrelevant.

509
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,980
Think back to the shallow pond example.

510
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,060
This child is drowning in the pond.

511
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,740
You don't want to get your pants wet or muddy.

512
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:58,380
So you say, well look, if I save this child now, then this child is probably just going

513
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,940
to stumble into some other pond later and die anyway.

514
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,740
You would seem absurdly callous.

515
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,780
You would seem evil.

516
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:08,860
Singer says you would be evil.

517
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,740
And if you don't donate all of this money that you spent on luxuries, then you are evil.

518
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,620
That's what Singer says.

519
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:23,700
Okay, so I think we can agree that the conclusion of this argument is radical.

520
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,500
It's wild.

521
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:33,860
It seems to show that everyone that you know is a terrible person, is roughly as terrible

522
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:40,660
as someone who would let a child drown and die because they didn't want to get their

523
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,740
clothes muddy.

524
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:45,060
That's what the argument seems to show.

525
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
That's a new thing.

526
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:51,820
You probably don't think that you and your family are evil.

527
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:55,100
But the argument seems to show that.

528
00:32:55,100 --> 00:33:01,180
It's a very radical conclusion and the problem is it's very hard to see what's wrong with

529
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,580
the argument.

530
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,580
The argument seems like a good one.

531
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,300
And it has seemed that way to everyone who read this paper since 1972.

532
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:17,260
There are responses to it and there are philosophers who try very hard and have very clever, careful

533
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,700
things to say to try to show that this argument doesn't actually work.

534
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:27,140
But at least until we get to read some of those arguments, you should try to see if there's

535
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,140
anything wrong with this argument yourself.

536
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:44,100
Peter Singer, by the way.

537
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
He's still alive.

538
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,100
I met him.

539
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,100
We had dinner once.

540
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,100
He gave a talk and then I...

541
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,100
Anyway, I know him.

542
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,600
I know celebrities.
