0	7600	It's a very radical conclusion, and the problem is it's very hard to see what's wrong with
7600	8940	the argument.
8940	14860	The argument seems like a good one, and it has seemed that way to everyone who read this
14860	16900	paper since 1972.
16900	23660	Today we're talking about an absolutely revolutionary paper published by a philosopher
23660	28680	named Peter Singer in 1972.
28680	33640	The name of the paper is Famine Affluence and Morality.
33640	42840	And the basic idea is that the moral stance that you have, your attitude towards your
42840	49320	moral obligations and the things that you may or may not do in your life, and the attitude
49320	56080	that all of your friends and all of your relatives have, the general moral outlook that everyone
56080	59760	around you has, is deeply and profoundly wrong.
59760	68120	And the crazy thing about this paper is that, on the surface at least, it's very persuasive.
68120	72080	He seems, Singer, seems to be right.
72080	78720	It seems to be, once you go through the argument that he lays out, it seems to be that we need
78720	82760	to completely rework our entire society.
82760	86920	And more specifically, forget about society for a minute.
86920	92480	You need to completely rework your life if your life is going to be a moral one.
92480	99000	And sort of what makes the paper so radical is that I can say all of these things, that
99000	103360	the thesis of the paper is that you need to completely rework your life without knowing
103360	105080	anything about you.
105080	109880	I know virtually nothing about your life and your moral outlook and your values and the
109880	112800	kinds of things that you do on a day-to-day basis.
112800	119160	I can basically make some assumptions about my audience, general assumptions.
119160	124880	You live in a broadly capitalistic society, let's assume.
124880	126960	There are government regulations and that sort of thing.
126960	132960	And you live sometime in the beginning-ish of the 21st century.
132960	134440	That's basically enough.
134440	141080	If that's true of you, then Singer thinks that your whole life needs to be reworked
141080	144480	if you're going to live in a morally acceptable way.
144480	149240	Okay, if we're going to understand this argument, then we need one distinction to start out.
149240	153000	This is a technical distinction, but there's really only one technical term.
153000	155200	Here you go.
155200	159960	We're talking about the distinction between the super-erogatory and the obligatory.
159960	165040	Imagine this, you're getting together with a group of friends or coworkers or something
165040	170760	like that and you decide, you know what, this is a pretty early gathering.
170760	172480	It's a pretty early meeting.
172480	178120	And so wouldn't it be nice if I went and got everyone some coffee and danishes because
178120	181040	some people are going to be rushing out of their house and they're not going to have
181040	182400	time to eat breakfast.
182400	189520	And so when everyone shows up, surprise, surprise, there is some coffee and donuts and treats
189520	193200	or whatever that you brought for everyone and you paid for and you're just giving it
193200	195160	to them and you say, hey guys, I brought these for you.
195160	196880	I want you to have them.
196880	201640	That act, that action is super-erogatory.
201640	202720	It's extra.
202720	204040	It's super.
204040	207920	You didn't have to do it, but it was a really nice thing to do.
207920	211800	It was an extra thing that you did and it was a good thing to do.
211800	214520	It was not obligatory.
214520	217200	Something is obligatory if you have to do it.
217200	223960	So if someone is assigned in the group to bring coffee and breakfast to every early
223960	229320	morning meeting and you signed up, you promised, you committed to bringing coffee and breakfast
229320	233200	on that day, well then bringing coffee and breakfast is obligatory.
233200	237440	And of course it would be nice if everyone thanked you for bringing those things even
237440	239760	if you agreed or promised to do it.
239760	241000	It wasn't extra.
241000	243200	It was something you had to do.
243200	244600	You had committed to it.
244600	247000	You were obliged to do it.
247000	250040	One more example just to bring out this distinction.
250040	251960	And this example may date this video.
251960	256600	It may give you a sense of when I'm making this video, but anyway, at the time of the
256600	261360	recording of this video, there's something going on in supermarkets where when you check
261360	266280	out in the supermarket and you're paying for your groceries or whatever, well there's
266280	269280	some of the payment is obligatory.
269280	275040	You have to pay for the things that you are buying, but then there's this extra payment.
275040	279360	They say when you're checking out, they're like, would you like to donate $1 to and then
279360	280680	they name some charity?
280680	284760	Would you like to add $1 to your bill here at the supermarket?
284760	287120	That additional payment, that's extra.
287120	288680	You don't have to do it.
288680	289680	It's up to you.
289680	291080	It's super-erogatory.
291080	292760	If you do do it, it's good.
292760	294400	That's a nice thing that you did, right?
294400	295600	But you didn't have to.
295600	296600	Super-erogatory.
296600	298040	That's what that word means.
298040	301680	Okay, here's the claim of this paper.
301680	306280	The claim is that there are these organizations that exist in the world now.
306280	309600	Now in 1972, says Singer.
309600	315160	These organizations like Oxfam and UNICEF, these are organizations that take money from
315160	320360	people who live in relatively wealthy places on the planet.
320360	326000	They take that money and they use it to do amazing things for people who are suffering
326000	327520	under things like famines.
327520	331640	If there's a famine in some place in the world, there's not enough food and people are literally
331640	333560	starving to death.
333560	336840	They are dying because they don't have enough food.
336840	343000	So someone donates a little bit of money and these organizations take that money and a
343000	347320	very high percentage of that money with a great deal of efficiency gets transported to
347320	354640	this other place on the planet where there's a famine and literal people's lives are saved.
354640	360240	Normally we, you and I and all of your relatives and all of your friends, everyone in our society
360240	366440	and our broader society, we think of these sorts of acts, giving charity in this way,
366440	369240	giving money to Oxfam or UNICEF or whatever.
369240	372720	We think of these things as supererogatory.
372720	375000	Giving to charity is supererogatory.
375000	378600	It's nice, it's good, but you don't have to do it.
378600	382800	If on any given occasion you don't do it, you're not a bad person, it's not like you
382800	385880	failed to live up to some obligation that you had.
385880	393960	The writer says, no, here's an argument that proves, Singer thinks, that giving to charity,
393960	401560	giving extra money to famine relief, if you're affluent, if you have extra money, is something
401560	403560	that you must do.
403560	410280	You must do it in the same way that you must not murder or you must catch someone.
410280	413680	If they're falling and you can just reach out your arms and catch them and save them,
413680	415200	you must do it.
415200	416200	That's the thesis.
416200	422360	Okay, so Singer has an argument for this thesis, an argument for this conclusion, but we're
422360	424480	going to get to the argument in one minute.
424480	429800	First let's just skip to the end of the paper and see his statement of that conclusion.
429800	434000	Here's what he says.
434000	439800	Here's what Singer says, because giving money is regarded as an act of charity, it is not
439800	443280	thought that there is anything wrong with not giving.
443280	448120	The charitable man, or if we want, because this was written in 1972, we can say the charitable
448120	449120	person.
449120	456880	The charitable person may be praised, but the person who is not charitable is not condemned.
456880	463120	People do not feel in any way ashamed or guilty about spending money on new clothes or a new
463120	466280	car instead of giving it to famine relief.
466280	469320	Indeed, the alternative does not occur to them.
469320	470320	What's the alternative?
470320	475400	The alternative is not getting those new clothes and not getting that new car and instead taking
475400	479080	that money that you would have spent on new clothes and just, well, wearing your old clothes
479080	484160	and taking that money and giving it to an organization that will help people, that will
484160	487240	save people who are dying of famine.
487240	492680	That possibility, the possibility of not spending money on luxuries, does not occur
492680	495760	to most people or to virtually anyone.
495760	500300	This way of looking at the matter cannot be justified.
500300	504380	This way of looking at the matter is the way that we all look at the matter.
504380	510900	That is, we think that giving money to famine relief is super erogatory.
510900	511900	It's nice.
511900	515260	It's an extra thing that cannot be justified.
515260	518940	The only thing, according to Singer, that can be justified, and we're going to get to
518940	523660	the argument for this conclusion, the only thing that can be justified is the way of
523660	527620	thinking where you think that giving to famine relief instead of buying new clothes or a new
527620	531660	car or whatever, giving to famine relief is obligatory.
531660	534500	That's the only way of thinking that can be justified.
534500	538020	The upshot or the punchline is this.
538020	544900	If you don't give to famine relief, Singer thinks, you've done something wrong.
544900	549540	You've done something evil, bad.
549540	556660	Every time you buy new clothes that you don't absolutely need or you buy a new car when you
556660	564020	could just drive your old car or you buy a cup of coffee that someone else made for you
564020	567580	because it's more convenient for them to make it for you and it tastes a little better than
567580	569260	if you were to make it at home.
569260	572180	Every time you do any of those things, you're doing something wrong.
572180	573820	You're doing something bad.
573820	575820	We don't think this way.
575820	581420	No one in our society, not in 1972 and even though this is a super famous paper, you've
581420	586520	maybe never heard of it and so it didn't seep into the whole society even now, right?
586520	591640	People don't think that buying new clothes or buying a cup of coffee from a coffee shop
591640	596880	is a bad thing to do, an evil thing to do, a wrong thing to do, but Singer thinks that
596880	601480	it is and here's his argument for that conclusion.
601480	606720	Okay, here's the argument.
606720	612840	Singer doesn't lay out the argument like this with four premises and one conclusion or anything.
612840	617760	I'm pulling these out of the paper, but this is indeed the argument.
617760	618760	Here's how it goes.
618760	620760	Let's take it one step at a time.
620760	627800	One, if it is in our power to prevent something very bad from happening without thereby sacrificing
627800	632860	anything of moral significance, then we must morally do it.
632860	635840	That is, prevent that very bad thing from happening.
635840	638160	Okay, that's premise one.
638160	639840	I'll just give you a hint.
639840	642600	This is going to be the most controversial claim, right?
642600	644440	It's a very general claim.
644440	647400	It's talking about very bad things.
647400	653000	It's got this big category of very bad things and then it's got this other category of things
653000	655800	that you might sacrifice that are not of moral significance.
655800	656800	That's another big category.
656800	661120	It's a big grand claim about what you must do morally and it's a very general claim.
661120	665040	So one is going to be the most controversial claim in this argument.
665040	666480	So we'll come back to this.
666480	671880	If you're looking for this claim, by the way, in the reading, then go to page 235.
671880	678240	There's one big paragraph in the middle of page 235 and this claim happens, not phrased
678240	683200	exactly like this, but basically like this, at the sort of end of that paragraph.
683200	685680	Anyway, let's keep going.
685680	692640	Step two, hunger, disease, and other sources of suffering, disability, and death are very
692640	694640	bad.
694640	698680	Okay, those are some examples of very bad things.
698680	703240	We see how this is going to connect up with the first premise, right?
703240	708600	We've got a bunch of very bad things and it's said in the first premise that if it's in
708600	714800	your power or if it's in our power to prevent something very bad, well then we've got to
714800	715800	do that thing.
715800	716800	We've got to prevent those things.
716800	720120	So these are going to be the things that we're going to need to prevent this argument's
720120	721120	going to claim.
721120	724960	It's just specifying some very bad things.
724960	728960	And premise two, by the way, seems totally plausible.
728960	735880	Hunger, disease, and other sources of suffering, disability, and death are very bad.
735880	738400	Yes, that's plausible.
738400	739400	Hunger is very bad.
739400	742440	Real hunger, where someone doesn't have enough food to eat.
742440	744000	And disease.
744000	749000	And other things that cause people to suffer or become disabled or die.
749000	750200	All of that is bad.
750200	751200	Yep, okay.
751200	752200	Good job.
752200	755240	Premise two, very plausible.
755240	762320	Premise three, the luxuries on which we spend money are not of moral significance.
762320	765600	So the kinds of luxuries he's talking about are these luxuries, right?
765600	766600	Buying new clothes.
766600	772440	When your old clothes, although out of fashion or a little tattered or whatever, are perfectly
772440	773440	good.
773440	774960	Or buying a new car.
774960	781480	When your old car, although not as good as a new car, is still a good enough car, right?
781680	785600	The example that I gave earlier, buying a cup of coffee when you could make the coffee
785600	787280	at home.
787280	792280	Really going to any restaurant ever, right, counts as a luxury in this sense.
792280	796440	I mean, you can always just, for less money, make food at home.
796440	802160	This connects with the idea of moral significance or of some things not being of moral significance,
802160	803660	right?
803660	806360	Sacrificing anything of moral significance.
806360	808160	That's part of the first premise also.
808160	813440	So premise three is specifying the kinds of things that aren't of moral significance.
813440	818160	And once we understand what singer means by luxuries, he's right.
818160	820200	These things are not of moral significance.
820200	821200	They're not a big deal.
821200	824920	If you go without them, you're not really worse off.
824920	833720	Four, by donating money to relief agencies like Oxfam, we could prevent hunger, disease,
833720	836880	and other sources of suffering, disability, and death.
837240	843520	Well, that's just saying that there's a very specific way, an easy way, right?
843520	849120	To prevent these things which premise two established were very bad.
849120	850640	Premise four, is it true?
850640	854760	By donating money to relief agencies like Oxfam, we could prevent hunger, disease, and
854760	857160	other sources of suffering, disability, and death.
857160	859120	Yes, premise four is true.
859120	860520	This is true.
860520	862120	These organizations do do this.
862120	865720	You can give them the money and then they will prevent these things.
865720	869160	Yes, premise four is just an empirical claim.
869160	873920	It's just a claim about whether these organizations actually do the thing that they say they're
873920	874920	going to do.
874920	876800	And the answer is yes, they do do it.
876800	878400	Okay, and then here's the conclusion.
878400	879680	And we've already reached this conclusion.
879680	881600	We've already talked through this conclusion.
881600	887160	Therefore, we must, must, where is it?
887160	888160	Where is it?
888160	889160	Must.
889160	890160	We are obligated.
890160	891160	It's not super erogatory.
891160	892360	It's not extra.
892360	894480	This is something you have to do.
894480	896960	And so the conclusion gets us something you have to do.
896960	903920	We must morally donate the money that we spend on luxuries to relief agencies.
903920	905760	And we don't get to spend them on luxuries.
905760	907160	This is the argument.
907160	912840	Okay, so now is a good time to reemphasize how radical this conclusion is.
912840	914480	We're about to assess the argument.
914480	918520	We're really going to focus almost entirely on premise one because premise one is the
918520	920760	only controversial premise in the argument.
920760	921760	Everything else.
921760	922760	Steps two, three, and four.
922920	926880	I mean, these just seem to be obviously correct, obviously true statements.
926880	929440	And the argument is, is valid.
929440	934040	So well, one is the only option that we could argue against, and we're going to try to argue
934040	935040	against it.
935040	938000	And Singer is going to say no, and none of those arguments work.
938000	942720	Okay, but focusing again on the conclusion for a minute before we get back to premise
942720	945880	one, this is pretty radical.
945880	951240	No one thinks that we have a moral obligation, no one, none of your friends, none of your
951240	957280	family think that you must not buy a cup of coffee.
957280	959040	You must not buy a new car.
959040	960440	You must not buy new clothes.
960440	967720	Instead, you must take all of that money and donate it to some organization like Oxfam.
967720	969280	One of these relief agencies.
969280	972160	No one lives their life like this, or very few people.
972160	974600	Peter Singer, by the way, he's still alive.
974600	975760	I met him, right?
975760	976760	We had dinner once.
976760	977760	He gave a talk.
977760	978760	And then I...
978760	979760	Anyway, I know him.
979760	980760	I know celebrities.
981480	985920	Peter Singer, who's still alive, kind of lives his life like this.
985920	992240	He donates a very significant, non-truvial portion of his income, which is not enormous.
992240	996440	It's not an enormous income to relief agencies.
996440	997840	He does this.
997840	1002320	He does not live a luxurious life, not a life that we would normally call luxurious.
1002320	1004280	Okay, so there's one.
1004280	1007460	And then maybe there's, I don't know, a few of his friends who he convinced.
1007460	1010780	But most people don't live their life like this.
1010780	1021500	The conclusion of this paper is that most people, you included, are doing something bad every
1021500	1023140	day.
1023140	1024780	And you don't even realize it.
1024780	1029220	Okay, enough about how radical this conclusion is or whatever and how much it departs from
1029220	1030580	your day-to-day life.
1030580	1031580	Let's get to premise one.
1031580	1033380	This is the controversial premise.
1033380	1038460	What does Singer say to support such a broad sweeping claim?
1038460	1040220	Here's what he says.
1044220	1050300	This is a rather famous example that Singer gives to support premise one.
1050300	1051300	Here it is.
1051300	1057260	If I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in
1057260	1059300	and pull the child out.
1059300	1061840	This will mean getting my clothes muddy.
1061840	1066520	But this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad
1066520	1068020	thing.
1068020	1072120	Okay, got the example, right?
1072120	1074920	There's a shallow pond or a fountain.
1074920	1080520	When I teach this class on campus, every college campus, including the one where I work in
1080520	1084440	North Carolina, every college campus has like a fountain somewhere, right?
1084440	1086440	There's a fountain there.
1086440	1090580	A small child is drowning in the fountain and will die.
1090580	1092440	You are walking by.
1092440	1097280	You can easily step in and save the child.
1097280	1103240	The cost to you will be just a few moments and, well, your clothes are going to get wet
1103240	1104560	or muddy, right?
1104560	1107760	Muddy if it's a pond or wet, if it's a fountain or whatever.
1107760	1113840	This sacrifice, by the way, is not of moral significance, right?
1113840	1116800	It is insignificant that your clothes are going to get a little wet.
1116800	1120720	Oh, and you're on your way to something where you didn't want your clothes to be wet.
1120720	1124040	Okay, that's not a very significant sacrifice.
1124040	1131520	But the death of the child, the drowning death of the child in almost all circumstances would
1131520	1133640	be a very bad thing.
1133640	1136720	Well, the thought is go from this example.
1136720	1141160	If you agree with what Singer says about this example, and I suggest, of course, that you
1141880	1148840	if someone just showed up at a meeting and said, hey, there is this kid drowning, but
1148840	1151640	I didn't want to have wet clothes for this gathering.
1151640	1155160	So I just let the kid drown and die.
1155160	1156880	You would be horrified.
1156880	1161280	You would think that this person was evil, that they had done an evil thing.
1161280	1166400	You would not let your friends or family associate with this kind of person.
1166400	1171320	Well, if you agree with Singer about this specific case, then Singer says, we should
1171320	1177320	be able to abstract from this case to a more general principle, and you should hold this
1177320	1181680	more general principle, and the more general principle is premise one of the argument.
1181680	1188360	The idea is that, well, a child drowning in a pond, that's a very bad thing.
1188360	1192600	But it's not bad because it has to do with water or children.
1193040	1198840	An adult drowning and dying is also a bad thing, or even an adult dying by some other
1198840	1200760	means is a bad thing.
1200760	1205880	What's relevant here is not that it's a child or that it's a water-involving death.
1205880	1209560	It's that this is an easily preventable death.
1209560	1214880	The death is a bad thing, and the fact that your clothes would get muddy, that's a morally
1214880	1219480	insignificant thing, but the fact that it's your clothes and it's mud, that doesn't matter
1219480	1222040	if it's something else that you have to sacrifice.
1222040	1228400	If, for example, instead of your clothes getting wet or muddy, your, I don't know, your car
1228400	1233840	is going to get dirty, or you're going to lose your shoelaces, the shoelaces will be
1233840	1234840	gone forever.
1234840	1238440	You'll have to sacrifice your shoelaces, and you'll have to get whole new shoelaces,
1238440	1240440	and that'll be kind of a pain in the butt.
1240440	1245520	The point is this, the difference between one way of dying and another way of dying,
1245520	1249960	or one morally insignificant sacrifice and another morally insignificant sacrifice, the
1249960	1251680	difference between these doesn't matter.
1251680	1257920	So you can go from a specific case like this to a general claim like one.
1257920	1263560	And the thought is, if you agree with Singer about this specific case, then you have to
1263560	1267160	accept premise one of the argument, okay?
1267160	1277760	So there are two ways in which you might think you can't go from this example to this premise.
1277760	1282320	Or another way to put this point is you might think that there are two big differences between
1282320	1288240	this shallow pond example and the example of giving up your luxuries, the luxuries in
1288240	1292480	your life, a new car, a cup of coffee, that sort of thing, a massage.
1292480	1296640	There's a difference between this example and giving up those things to save someone
1296640	1298000	from a famine.
1298000	1302120	There's two ways in which there might be a relevant difference.
1302120	1306280	These are the two relevant differences that Singer considers and responds to.
1306280	1307280	Here they are.
1307280	1313240	Okay, here's the first potentially relevant difference, proximity.
1313240	1317240	In the shallow pond example, you're right next to the child.
1317240	1319760	You're very close to this child.
1319760	1327920	Whereas in your day-to-day life, you are not right next to, you're not near the people
1327920	1334720	who are dying of famine or of whatever other very terrible things that organizations like
1334720	1336280	Oxfam fight against.
1336280	1339160	Well, is that a morally relevant difference?
1339160	1344880	Is that a way in which we block this example from generalizing to something like premise
1344880	1346080	one?
1346080	1347840	Singer thinks no.
1347840	1354280	It used to be that proximity made a significant moral difference because it used to be that
1354280	1359920	a great distance prevented people from knowing about very bad things.
1359920	1362720	It used to be that if there was some very bad thing happening on the other side of the
1362720	1367920	world several hundred years ago, you could never know about that very bad thing or you
1367920	1371960	couldn't find out about it for months or years.
1371960	1378520	But now, now proximity is irrelevant to your knowledge of very bad things because there's
1378520	1381400	very efficient forms of communication.
1381400	1387880	You can know about a famine going on in another country while it's going on with enough time
1387880	1390200	to do something about it.
1390200	1394640	Proximity also used to be relevant before these organizations existed.
1394640	1401280	It used to be the case that you weren't able to sacrifice some luxury in order to save
1401280	1407160	someone from a famine because, well, it was very hard to get things across the world and
1407160	1412200	there weren't organizations set up that had built very efficient systems for taking a
1412200	1418080	few dollars from you and literally saving a person's life on the other side of the planet.
1418080	1420680	So proximity used to matter.
1420680	1426640	It used to be a morally relevant difference between the pond example and the famine example.
1426640	1431440	But it's not anymore, says Singer.
1431440	1438000	So this difference of proximity does not prevent your intuition, your thoughts, your moral
1438000	1445840	thoughts about an example like this from translating over to a very general claim like one.
1445840	1447120	Here's the other potential difference.
1447120	1453200	If you're trying to block this example from getting the result ultimately that you have
1453200	1455340	to give up all the luxuries in your life.
1455340	1460620	You might say, look, in this shallow pond example, we're led to assume that there's
1460620	1462580	no one else that could save the child.
1462580	1466940	There are no others who are capable of saving the child.
1466940	1473740	But in the case of famine relief, anyone could give money to Oxfam, right?
1473740	1478420	There's all these other people present and the thought is, well, in the cases where there's
1478420	1480940	all these other people present, it doesn't fall on you.
1480940	1488500	You don't get the obligation to be the one who saves someone's life when they're dying
1488500	1489500	of famine.
1489500	1491820	Here's what Singer says in response to that.
1491820	1499500	He says, look, the presence of others who could help is sort of relevant because their
1499500	1503820	presence typically leads to their actually helping.
1503820	1508060	Those other people actually helping prevent the very bad thing.
1508780	1515620	If there were other people who saw the child drowning in the shallow pond, well, then very
1515620	1519460	likely one of those other people would save the child and then you wouldn't have to save
1519460	1520460	the child.
1520460	1526620	If then you showed up at the meeting and said, hey, there was this kid drowning in the pond
1526620	1530580	and whoever was going to go in and save the kid was going to get their clothes wet and
1530580	1533220	someone says, your clothes aren't wet.
1533220	1535300	Are you an evil monster?
1535300	1538900	You say, no, no, no, there were other people there and someone else saved the kid.
1538900	1541820	And they'd say, oh, okay, wow, that must have been something.
1541820	1545380	Let's get on to our frappe party or whatever we were about to do.
1545380	1549260	The point is, the presence of others is only relevant if those other people are going to
1549260	1550580	do something.
1550580	1555740	If they're not going to do anything, then it seems like, at least to Singer, the obligation
1555740	1556900	is on you.
1556900	1561580	If there's other people who are able to see that this child is drowning, but these other
1561580	1568220	people care a great, great deal about getting their clothes wet or muddy and they're not
1568220	1574460	going to step in to save the child and you know this and they say this to you, well,
1574460	1579220	does the fact that they're there and they could save the child excuse you from your
1579220	1581220	duty to save the child?
1581220	1582220	No.
1582220	1586340	If you show up at the meeting and you say, I was going to save this kid, but there were
1586340	1589100	these other people there and they say, who saved the child?
1589100	1590660	And you say, no one saved the child.
1590660	1591660	The child drowned.
1591660	1593820	The child is dead now.
1593820	1595980	Everyone would say, you're a monster.
1595980	1596980	You're an evil person.
1596980	1597980	You should have saved the child.
1597980	1600140	And you say, yeah, but there were other people there.
1600140	1601140	It doesn't matter.
1601140	1602820	The other people didn't do anything about it.
1602820	1605580	So that means you have to do something about it.
1605580	1610420	The fact that there are other people who could help in the case of famine, in the case of
1610420	1614600	a drowning child is itself irrelevant.
1614600	1618260	What matters is if someone else does help and then there's no more need for you because
1618260	1622060	all the children have been saved or all the people have been saved from famine.
1622060	1628340	A lot of people donate to organizations like Oxfam, some amount of money or other, but
1628340	1632180	there's still plenty of people left who need to be saved.
1632180	1637740	And so you have an obligation to them, according to Singer.
1637740	1642940	The fact that there are other people who aren't helping also, that just seems totally irrelevant.
1642940	1644500	Okay.
1644500	1646860	A few ending notes.
1646860	1649500	One, how much do we have to give?
1649500	1656420	I mean, it's one thing to give up, you know, one cup of coffee, right, made at a fancy
1656420	1658700	coffee place, right?
1658700	1663300	But do I have to give up all the coffee that I might ever buy?
1663300	1668500	Do I have to never buy coffee and never get a new car and never get new clothes?
1668500	1671460	Am I allowed no luxuries at all?
1671460	1677900	Do I have to give away so much of my money that I'm reduced to the level of the person
1677900	1682340	who's suffering from this famine or near to that level?
1682340	1685620	Singer says, maybe yes.
1685620	1688940	He considers two versions of premise one, right?
1688940	1691980	And this is more specific and it's in the paper.
1691980	1694980	I think it happens on, where does it happen?
1694980	1697180	It happens on page 231.
1697180	1701380	He considers two versions of premise one a stronger principle and a weaker principle.
1701380	1703340	And this is the weaker one, right?
1703340	1706380	According to the weaker principle, you just have to give up some luxuries.
1706380	1710540	You don't have to reduce yourself all the way down to the level that's near equivalent
1710540	1712540	to the people that you're saving.
1712540	1714580	But according to the stronger principle, you do.
1714580	1719540	And Singer actually thinks this argument basically works for the stronger principle.
1719540	1721100	You have to give up a lot.
1721100	1725380	Here's an objection, an additional objection that Singer considers.
1725380	1730900	He considers this on pages 236, 237, 238, if you're looking in the text.
1730900	1732860	This is just too demanding.
1732860	1737540	This is too much to ask for people to give up all these things.
1737540	1739540	To that Singer says a couple things.
1739540	1748620	One thing he says is, look, that is a standard, you know, objection to utilitarianism.
1748620	1752780	And Singer is himself a utilitarian or at least he's a consequentialist.
1752780	1754300	I can't remember.
1754300	1759980	Anyway, he's close to a utilitarian and he could be for the purposes of this paper.
1759980	1765060	So well, it's a standard objection against utilitarianism that it's too demanding.
1765060	1768660	But Singer just thinks that this is a very weak objection.
1768660	1771300	Maybe morality is very demanding.
1771300	1773540	The argument seems to work.
1773540	1779060	The fact that you don't like the conclusion, which is really what the too demanding objection
1779060	1785700	comes to, the fact that you don't like the conclusion is not an argument that the conclusion
1785700	1786820	is false.
1786820	1791900	He considers another argument, this is on page 239, another argument that goes like
1791900	1792900	this.
1792900	1801860	If private individuals start donating money to famine relief, then governments will stop.
1801860	1807020	And if governments stop donating money because the private individuals have got it taken
1807020	1810260	care of, well then very bad things will result.
1810260	1814900	There won't be enough money because the governments are the real source of the money or whatever.
1814900	1819700	Another response to this, part of his response is to just say, don't worry about it.
1819700	1821420	Not that many people are going to start giving.
1821420	1825020	It's not going to prevent governments from donating money.
1825020	1826780	Governments don't give that much money to begin with.
1826780	1833860	And if you give every dollar that you have, that's not enough to affect how much governments
1833860	1834860	give.
1834860	1837580	You're not going to solve this problem on your own.
1837580	1842340	And if your only objection is, hey, if I give all my money, I'll totally solve the problem.
1842340	1843340	That's just a weak objection.
1843340	1845220	Yes, you'll totally solve the problem.
1845220	1846220	Good.
1846220	1847220	Solve it.
1847220	1852580	The last objection that Singer considers, this happens on page 240 in the reading, is
1852580	1858060	the thought that, well look, if you donate all this money to famine relief, it's just
1858060	1859980	famine relief.
1859980	1861500	It's going to help these people.
1861500	1862820	It's going to save their lives.
1862820	1866740	Sure, but there'll be another famine in a few years from now.
1866740	1869020	Maybe in that place, maybe in a different place.
1869020	1872260	You're just postponing these famines.
1872260	1875020	Singer says, no, you're not.
1875020	1878500	Those famines are going to happen one way or another.
1878500	1884660	And if you donate the money to help people who are dying of this famine today, and when
1884660	1890380	he wrote this paper in 1972, there was a specific famine that he was talking about.
1890380	1896140	If you donate the money, you will save these particular people's lives.
1896140	1901220	And the fact that there's going to be more famines in the future, maybe that affect these
1901220	1905140	people, maybe that affect other people, it just seems irrelevant.
1905140	1906980	Think back to the shallow pond example.
1906980	1910060	This child is drowning in the pond.
1910060	1913740	You don't want to get your pants wet or muddy.
1913740	1918380	So you say, well look, if I save this child now, then this child is probably just going
1918380	1921940	to stumble into some other pond later and die anyway.
1921940	1924740	You would seem absurdly callous.
1924740	1926780	You would seem evil.
1926780	1928860	Singer says you would be evil.
1928860	1933740	And if you don't donate all of this money that you spent on luxuries, then you are evil.
1933740	1935620	That's what Singer says.
1935620	1943700	Okay, so I think we can agree that the conclusion of this argument is radical.
1943700	1945500	It's wild.
1945500	1953860	It seems to show that everyone that you know is a terrible person, is roughly as terrible
1953860	1960660	as someone who would let a child drown and die because they didn't want to get their
1960660	1962740	clothes muddy.
1962740	1965060	That's what the argument seems to show.
1965060	1967060	That's a new thing.
1967060	1971820	You probably don't think that you and your family are evil.
1971820	1975100	But the argument seems to show that.
1975100	1981180	It's a very radical conclusion and the problem is it's very hard to see what's wrong with
1981180	1982580	the argument.
1982580	1985580	The argument seems like a good one.
1985580	1991300	And it has seemed that way to everyone who read this paper since 1972.
1991300	1997260	There are responses to it and there are philosophers who try very hard and have very clever, careful
1997260	2001700	things to say to try to show that this argument doesn't actually work.
2001700	2007140	But at least until we get to read some of those arguments, you should try to see if there's
2007140	2009140	anything wrong with this argument yourself.
2012580	2024100	Peter Singer, by the way.
2024100	2025100	He's still alive.
2025100	2026100	I met him.
2026100	2027100	We had dinner once.
2027100	2028100	He gave a talk and then I...
2028100	2029100	Anyway, I know him.
2029100	2030600	I know celebrities.
