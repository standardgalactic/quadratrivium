0	8320	Pickles. And you don't like pickles. And you say, pickles. Barf. Pickles barf is not something
8320	10000	that can be literally true or false.
21120	24880	Recording another one of these lecture videos.
24880	36720	Ugh. Today we're talking about AJ Ayer and chapter 6 of his book. But let's talk about what I just said.
36720	47760	That utterance. Can that be true or false? Literally. Can it literally be true that recording a lecture
47760	58800	video? Ugh. No. It can't. That's not the kind of thing that can be true or false. I don't mean that
58800	66240	that statement or that utterance isn't true. I mean that it can't be true. And I don't mean
66240	71680	that it isn't false. I mean that it can't be false. This kind of utterance. This kind of
71680	80640	linguistic expression when you say, ugh. That can't be true or false. Or you see some pickles.
80640	88400	And you don't like pickles. And you say, pickles. Barf. Pickles barf is not something that can be
88400	96640	literally true or false. Whereas by comparison, an ordinary assertion, something along the lines of
97360	105280	it's raining can be true or false, right? It's raining is true when it's raining. And it's false
105280	112880	when it's not raining. So there's a difference here. Some utterances have what's called a truth
112880	119200	value. They can be true or false. And some utterances don't. They can't be true or false.
119200	126960	These, these ones, this one in particular is just merely an expression of a sentiment. It's just
126960	133360	merely expressing how I feel. I come in here and I say, recording another one of these lecture videos.
135040	142800	That's just expressing my sentiment about having to record another one of these lecture videos.
142800	149280	It expresses the sentiment of distaste or not wanting to record the lecture video.
150000	157200	But it doesn't literally say, I don't want to record this lecture video. That would be something,
158160	161680	that would be an assertion, that would be something that could be true or false, right?
161680	175440	If I said, I don't want to record today, that's a full blown assertion. That can be true or false.
175440	181360	And it's true if I don't want to record today. And it's false if I do want to record today,
181360	189440	right? So these two utterances, they express the same feeling, but only one of them,
190160	198560	as Airwood put it, asserts a proposition that can be true or false. This one makes a claim. It
198560	202640	makes a claim about how the world is. In fact, it makes a claim about a very particular part of
202640	208880	the world. It makes a claim about me and my mind, this part of the world, the part where my wants
208880	213600	are. It says, I don't want to record today. That's just a statement about what I want.
214320	221280	This is not a statement about anything. Okay, so why are we talking about this? Well,
222400	231920	Air is going to make a claim about a particular type of talk or a particular type of discourse.
232560	242560	Namely, he's going to say that moral talk or moral discourse is not the kind of thing that can be
242560	254160	literally true or false. He's talking about moral talk. Notice something. Previously in this course,
254160	260720	we've been talking about something very different. We haven't been talking about moral talk. We've
260720	269920	been talking about morality. Previously, we've been talking about what's right and what's wrong,
270560	278000	right? So if you read a philosopher who's arguing, for example, that you should give all of your
279040	286560	expendable income, all of your extra income to charity, then that philosopher is making a claim
286560	292880	about morality, a claim about what's right and what's wrong. It's different to make a claim
292880	303680	about moral claims, a claim about moral language. Talking about this is a meta-ethical
303680	310880	claim. We're making a move from talking about morality or ethics to talking about morality
310880	318080	or ethics. Okay, so the key thing to take away is that everything we say about Air is about moral
318080	325040	talk. There is a connection with morality, and I'll say what that connection is right now,
325040	332080	but just know that all of the central claims that Air makes are about language. They're not about
332080	338640	what's right and wrong. They're about our talking about what's right and wrong. Okay, so what is the
338640	345760	connection between moral talk and morality for Air or for anyone who wants to say anything about the
345760	352880	nature of moral talk and philosophy? The connection typically is this. Let's say that you wanted to
352880	360960	be a moral skeptic. You wanted to say that there's no such thing as morality. Another way to put it
360960	367680	is that you'd be a moral anti-realist. You'd say there really are no moral facts. Well, you still
367680	373840	have to explain something that there obviously are. There obviously are lots of statements that
373840	382560	people make in real life about morality. He says to Tyson, maybe, violence is wrong. That's a moral
382560	388160	claim. That's moral talk. That's real. People really do say that. Now, the moral skeptic is going to
388160	395200	want to say, well, there really is no underlying morality that would make a statement like this
395200	401920	true. And so it looks on the surface like you've got two options. If you deny that there's any
401920	409280	morality, but there obviously is moral talk, you can either say that all of this moral talk
410480	417280	is false or misguided or confused and that therefore, presumably, we should stop. We should
417280	422000	stop engaging in it. We should stop the moral talk. We should stop saying this sort of thing.
422000	428880	And we say it a lot. So that's a huge revision of what we're doing is to say that all of this
428880	435280	talk is mistaken and misguided or false and that we should let go of it. That's one option.
435280	440480	But the other option for the moral skeptic who wants to get rid of morality is to say that
441520	451680	all moral talk is not really truth apt. It's not true or false. So it's not false. It's doing
451680	456880	something else altogether and so we can keep it. We can keep this moral talk, which is a big part
456880	462480	of our lives, even though we're getting rid of morality itself. And so what we're going to get
462480	467680	from Ayer today in the little snippet of the chapter that we read is an account of this kind
467680	473600	of language that allows us to say that it's not true or false. It allows us to say that it's like...
475280	483120	It's like... Right? It's a kind of talk that can't be true or false and that therefore,
483120	488080	the fact that there isn't some underlying moral reality does not entail that we need
488080	495360	to get rid of all this talk. We can keep it. So here's something that Ayer says. This actually
495360	501040	wasn't in the part of the reading that we read for today, but it was on the reading guide that you
501040	510240	read. Here's what he says. So he says, value statements are not in the literal sense significant,
510240	515840	but are simply expressions of emotion, which can be neither true nor false. What does that mean?
516480	523040	All right. Well, let's just go through some talk, some examples of talk. Here are some things
523040	533280	that you can say. Ready? One thing that you could say is the door is shut. You could say that.
533680	541840	That's an assertion. You're telling me something about the door, right? The door is shut. This
541840	547840	sort of thing can be true or false. The door is shut. It's true if the door really is shut
547840	553360	and it's false if the door is not shut. That's easy. Okay, but there's lots and lots and lots
553360	559360	and lots of language that can't be true or false. One example is the one that I already gave at
559360	568320	the beginning of video of the video, which is if you just say or something like that. That's some
568320	577840	kind of exclamation or something like that or some kind of expression. And you can say that and it
577840	583040	can be very meaningful. That can be a very meaningful thing to say, but it's not the kind of thing
583040	591360	that can be true or false, right? True or false doesn't make sense. It's neither true nor false.
591360	597120	It's just merely an expression of emotion, which can be neither true nor false. That's
598320	605280	but it's not just sounds like that. Also, what if I said this is the door shut?
605280	615200	We have a name for utterances like this. Questions. A question also can't be true or false, right?
616240	622160	A question isn't making a claim about how the world is. It's not saying that the door is shut.
622160	628480	It's not saying that the door is open. It's just asking what's up with the door, right? So a question
628480	633760	can't be true or false, but it's still a perfectly meaningful thing to say. It's just not in the
633760	639520	business of describing how the world is so it can't be true or false. Or here's another one,
639520	645920	ready? Shut the door. What's that? I don't know. That's like an order or a command.
646560	655760	An order or a command. Can that be true or false? No. No, that can't be true or false, right?
656720	662160	It's not telling you that the door is shut. It's telling you to shut the door, right?
662160	669680	All of these, these three at least, they are all talking about the door and its status,
669680	676800	but one of them and only one of them is describing the status of the door, whether or not it's shut.
676800	683520	The others are well asking about the status of the door and commanding someone to make the door
683520	690960	have a certain status, being shut, right? So actually it looks like most language,
690960	696880	most talk is not the sort of thing that can be true or false. Most of the things we say or that
696880	704560	come out of our mouths or at least a lot of them are not assertions. All right, here's the thing.
705680	712720	These statements, the kinds of value statements that we care about, we care about moral statements,
712800	717200	we care about value statements, at least right now we do, right, in this course.
717200	725440	These kinds of statements, the ones that look like this, violence is wrong, right?
726400	735520	That statement, it sure looks like the door is shut. The door is shut. Violence is wrong.
736400	742000	It looks like this is an assertion. It looks like lots of our moral talk is the kind of thing
742000	747360	that can be either true or false. And therefore, if there is no such thing as right or wrong,
747360	751520	of course, then all of these statements are going to be false because they're the kind of thing that
751520	760880	could be false because they're assertions. But Ayer thinks, no, these aren't assertions. They
760880	768800	look like assertions. This looks like this, but actually, really, literally, all it means is
768800	776560	something like this. According to Ayer, this is the part to remember. Don't miss this. According
776560	788960	to Ayer, violence is wrong is really like saying, boo, violence, boo, violence. That's not the kind
788960	794000	of thing that can be true or false. That's not actually making an assertion about how the world
794000	800080	is. Okay, so let's go back to the sentence. Value statements are not, in the literal sense,
800080	807520	significant. That is, they're not assertions that can be true or false. They are simply
807520	814480	expressions of emotion, which can neither be true or false, which can be neither true nor false.
815040	822480	That's what Ayer is saying. Ayer is saying that value statements like this, they look like this,
822480	829120	but they're really like that. Strictly speaking, they can't be true or false. Okay, so to further
829120	836560	understand this point, think about the context where we say things like urgh or boo, right? Say
836560	842640	that you're at a sporting event and half of the crowd in the stands are fans of one team and half
842640	847200	of the crowd are fans of another team. And they introduce a player at the beginning, right? And
847200	854960	they say, and now the point guard for the Golden State Warriors, Stefan Curry, right? And Curry comes
854960	864080	out and half of the audience says boo, and the other half says yay. Imagine the announcer then
864080	874240	comes along and says, well, who do you think is right? Boo or yay? No one's right. No one's wrong.
874240	881600	No one is making a claim about how the world is. They're just merely expressing how they feel.
883680	891120	Okay, notice one thing about these mere expressions and assertions.
892240	899280	They can still be criticized, both of them actually. So compare, for example, the following two things.
899360	910400	I could bump into you on the street and say sorry, right? Sorry. Or an alternative thing that I could
910400	918880	say in the very similar or exactly the same situation is I could say I am filled with sorrow
919200	932400	because I bumped into you. I could say that, right? This one is an assertion. This one is not,
933040	936960	right? This can be true or false. I am filled with sorrow because I bumped into you.
937680	944240	This is a description of how the world is. It's true if I really am filled with sorrow.
945200	951120	And it's false if I'm not filled with sorrow. But just saying sorry, that can't be true or false.
951120	955120	You bump into somebody on the street, they say sorry, you can't come back and say,
955120	963120	false. I don't think you are filled with sorrow. What? You can criticize them for being insincere.
963680	969120	You can say that didn't sound sincere. I don't think you're really sorry, right? If they bump into
969680	978480	you in the street and they say sorry, sorry like that, that's insincere. They're not really sorry.
979120	989040	Sorry is capable of being insincere because it expresses a sentiment or a feeling.
989760	998640	It expresses a feeling and therefore it can be sincere or insincere,
999520	1005600	you know, write it like that. Sincere or insincere, right? It can be sincere or insincere because
1005600	1011040	it expresses a sentiment and if you really have that sentiment, then it's sincere to say you're
1011040	1015920	sorry. But if you really don't have that sentiment, if you're not filled with sorrow, if you don't
1015920	1024000	have regret, then it's insincere. This can be insincere too, right? An assertion, this is an
1024000	1029200	assertion. It's an assertion about how the world is. It just says that the world, a very little bit
1029200	1036080	of the world, the part right here is a certain way. It says I am filled with sorrow. I feel lots
1036080	1042560	of sorrow. So this is an assertion but it also expresses a sentiment. It expresses basically
1042560	1048960	the same sentiment maybe and because it expresses that sentiment, it can also be sincere or insincere,
1050160	1058000	right? Just in the way sorrow can. But the assertion does a second thing. The other thing that it does
1058800	1070960	is that it, well, it puts forward a claim and it puts that forward, it puts forward that claim
1071040	1078800	as if it is true. It says of this, of this claim, this is the way the world really is,
1078800	1085360	this claim is true. I am filled with sorrow. It describes the world. Because of this,
1085360	1091840	it can be true or false, that assertion, right? So notice that the assertion is doing two things
1092560	1098880	and the mere expression of sorrow or sympathy is just doing one thing, right?
1099760	1106240	Ayer is able, because of these facts, Ayer is able to say when he translates violence is wrong
1106240	1112320	to boo violence, he's able to say that you're still able to criticize this kind of claim.
1112320	1116560	We still can criticize these claims. We criticize them as sincere or insincere.
1117360	1122160	We just can't strictly speaking criticize them as true or false.
1125120	1130000	Okay, so in a minute we're going to talk about an alternative theory, a different theory,
1130000	1136080	a theory other than Ayer's own theory that's also about moral talk. But let's just reiterate
1136080	1142160	really quick. This is Ayer's claim. His claim is that value statements like violence is wrong,
1142160	1146720	the kind of statement that he might have made to Mike Tyson during that encounter that we read
1146720	1153680	about, right? That kind of claim really just means boo violence. It's really not an assertion,
1153680	1158800	even though it looks like an assertion. Value statements are not in the literal sense significant,
1158800	1164800	but are simply expressions of emotion which can be neither true nor false. Okay,
1164800	1169760	he's going to now talk about an alternative theory. Let's get to that.
1170240	1180400	Remember that we are talking about language. We're talking about moral language or moral talk,
1181040	1187040	right? And our running example is this claim that Ayer might have made to Tyson or something like
1187040	1199840	that, the claim violence is wrong. Ayer says that what this claim really means is something like
1202320	1214000	boo violence. That's Ayer. All right, can you see me? Is this line in my face? It doesn't matter.
1214880	1220720	Violence is wrong really means boo violence. But there's an alternative theory. The name for that
1220720	1230400	theory that Ayer uses is the orthodox subjective theory. We're just going to call it subjectivism.
1233200	1238960	This is an alternative theory of what this phrase means. And the alternative theory just says
1238960	1247200	that this phrase means something like I dislike violence.
1249920	1258240	That's the subjectivist claim. Okay, so notice that these are very different, right? Whoops.
1260880	1267040	Ayer is claiming that this looks like an assertion, but it's no assertion at all. It's a mere
1267040	1272320	expression. It can't be true or false. The subjectivist is claiming that this assertion
1272320	1280720	is an assertion. It's just a different assertion, right? Violence is wrong looks like it's a claim
1280720	1286960	about violence. It looks like it's just saying violence is wrong. Really, according to the
1286960	1292000	subjectivist, this is an alternative to Ayer's approach that he brings up and then attacks,
1292560	1297840	really, according to the subjectivist, this is not a claim about violence. It's a claim about the
1297840	1304000	speaker. It's a claim about me when I'm talking. Let's back up for a second. We'll explain this
1304000	1310480	claim in a sec. But first, let's just see that these aren't the only two alternatives. This is one
1310480	1315600	translation of violence is wrong. This is another translation of violence is wrong. But then there's
1315600	1323920	the just sort of ordinary naive translation, right? The naive theory, the theory that you would
1323920	1328000	have if you weren't thinking hard about these things, and it might be the right theory, by the way.
1328720	1333840	The naive theory about statements like violence is wrong is just that it means
1335680	1343680	violence is wrong. That's what it means. It's an assertion. It asserts that violence has a
1343680	1350240	certain property and the property is wrongness, right? If you just take the statement, a regular
1350240	1360000	ordinary statement like grass is green, if you take an ordinary statement like that,
1360000	1366160	well, what does that really mean? What are you talking about? It really means that grass is green.
1366160	1371680	That's what it means. It's an assertion. It's true if grass is green. It's false if grass is any other
1371680	1378560	color. That's what grass is green means. Grass is green means grass is green. It says that grass
1378560	1383840	has a certain property of being green. That's it. You might think the same thing about violence
1383840	1390160	is wrong. That's the naive view. Violence is wrong just means violence is wrong. It has the feature
1390160	1397600	of being wrong. That's it. So both Ayer's theory and subjectivism are departing from the natural
1397600	1405280	way of interpreting this kind of language, this moral talk. Okay, but put that aside for a minute.
1405280	1413760	Let's understand these two alternative theories, Ayer's and subjectivism. Subjectivism means or
1413760	1423360	subjectivism claims rather that moral talk really consists of claims about the individual who's
1423360	1432640	speaking at the time. So when I say that violence is wrong, my statement can be true or false
1432640	1440720	according to subjectivism. It can be true or false, but its truth or falsity depends not on the nature
1440720	1447040	of violence and whether it's really wrong. It depends just on the nature of me, the speaker,
1447040	1453600	and whether I really dislike it or something like that, whether I have some negative sentiment
1453600	1458640	towards it. That's what really determines whether the statement is true or false. Whereas on Ayer's
1458640	1466400	view, the statement can't be true or false at all. Ayer brings up this theory, subjectivism,
1466400	1473520	for three reasons. The first reason is to help clarify what his own view is. Once you see that
1473600	1481600	there's an alternative theory about what moral statements mean that makes them into assertions,
1481600	1485440	just different assertions than you might have thought they were, then you realize, oh whoa,
1485440	1489840	his theory is rather radical. It says that they are not assertions at all. They're not
1489840	1494640	claims that can be true or false at all. Okay, so you get a clearer sense of what his view is.
1494640	1499920	His view is the violence view. You get a clearer sense of what his view is by just bringing this
1499920	1505120	view up and saying, my view is not that. Okay, so that's the first reason he brings up subjectivism.
1505120	1509600	The second reason he brings up subjectivism is because subjectivism is obviously wrong,
1509600	1515680	and he can attack it, and that shows that his theory has a certain advantage. It doesn't fall
1515680	1522000	prey to the kind of attack or mistake that destroys subjectivism. He only talks about this for like
1522000	1528160	two sentences in the part that we read. They come and go really fast, but basically the objection
1528160	1534160	that kills off subjectivism but that doesn't hurt Ayer's own theory is this. Violence is wrong
1534960	1544320	or any moral claim. It seems like if it's true, it's not true because of something about the
1544320	1551120	speaker, right? Imagine that a philosopher comes to talk to you and they make some moral claim.
1551120	1560640	They say, spending money on luxuries is evil. You cannot do it. It's wrong. Buying a cup of coffee
1560640	1566240	made at a coffee shop rather than just making the coffee yourself at home and donating the extra money
1566240	1572000	to famine relief is wrong. Those are all moral claims. They make moral claims like that and maybe
1572000	1579440	you start arguing with them and you say, oh no, you know, I live in a capitalist society and blah,
1580160	1584160	blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The philosopher can't just come back and say, no, no, no, no,
1584160	1589360	you don't understand. It's wrong. Let me prove it to you. And then they cut open their skull
1589360	1595280	and rip it open and put a brain scanner on them. And then the brain scanner reads off on a screen
1595280	1599600	and there on the screen it says, it shows all the things that they think and right there on the
1599600	1612400	screen it says, this guy dislikes coffee. That's what it said on the screen of the brain scanner
1612400	1616800	or it says something like, this guy dislikes spending money on coffee instead of donating
1616800	1623200	that money to famine relief. Does that, does that evidence, that brain scan evidence,
1623200	1629840	does that prove that the moral statement, you know, coffee is evil?
1631600	1640000	Does that prove that this statement is true? This brain scan? Brain scan? No, no it doesn't. No one
1640000	1645120	takes that seriously. That's not the kind of evidence that you'd ever try to give for a moral
1645120	1652320	statement like this. It's just obvious. We take this for granted in all of our moral discourse.
1652320	1659840	It's just obvious that moral statements like this are not statements about the speaker. If I
1659840	1665920	make a statement about me, we all know that it's a statement about me and we talk as if it's a
1665920	1673360	statement about me. I say, I'm exhausted and someone might say, oh, is it because you haven't
1673360	1680640	gotten enough sleep? It's all about me, right? Whereas if I say violence is wrong, no one says,
1680720	1686320	oh, is it because you're like a curmudgeonly person and you dislike a lot of stuff? Is that why
1686320	1691600	violence is wrong? No, that's not why violence is wrong. That might be why I think it's wrong,
1691600	1697040	but my thinking that it's wrong or my disliking it, that's not the same as it's being wrong.
1697040	1704320	If this is true, it sure isn't true just because I dislike violence. This theory,
1704320	1709760	subjectivism, this theory is no good. It makes this crazy claim that these statements are true
1709760	1715360	or false based on what the speaker is thinking or what the speaker feels, and that's just not
1715360	1722560	how anyone thinks about morality. So that is the second reason why air brings up subjectivism,
1722560	1728880	is to argue against it in that way. And it shows that air's view doesn't have that problem. I mean,
1728880	1735600	air's view is in a way more radical. It says that moral statements don't even have truth values,
1735600	1742400	but that radicalness gives it the advantage of not having to say that the truth value of a
1742400	1748080	moral statement depends on the speaker of the statement or the mind of the speaker of that
1748080	1756160	moral statement. Okay, so he argues against subjectivism in that way, but then the third reason,
1756160	1763760	the third reason that air brings up subjectivism is to give an objection to subjectivism,
1763760	1770240	raise an objection that comes from the philosopher G.E. Moore. Moore's objection.
1772400	1777120	So this objection is not like the one that we just saw towards subjectivism,
1777120	1782720	where it only applies to subjectivism and doesn't also apply to air's view. This objection, if it
1782720	1790160	works, also is a problem for air's own view. So we're going to talk about that objection,
1790160	1794080	and then we're going to get air's response to it. This all happens in like the four pages that we
1794080	1799680	read. So what is Moore's objection? This happens, by the way, in the reading that we're using
1800720	1807360	on page 110. We get an explanation of Moore's objection, and then also on 110 going on to 111,
1807360	1812800	we get air's response. So if you follow and understand everything I'm saying about Moore's
1812800	1818400	objection and air's response, but you didn't pick it up in the reading, go back to those pages,
1818400	1824880	reread those pages to get Moore's objection and air's response. Okay, well, what is Moore's objection?
1825440	1829200	The objection is this. Fundamentally, Moore is claiming that
1832160	1838880	we have genuine moral disagreements. We have genuine moral debates. We productively argue with one
1838880	1846240	another about morality, and when we do this, we literally contradict one another. When we have
1846240	1851600	moral debates or moral discussions, we very frequently have situations where one person
1851600	1858480	says something, and the other person says, no, that's not the case. That's false, right? So one
1858480	1873840	person says abortion is wrong, and another person says abortion is permissible. It's not wrong.
1874800	1882320	It might not be great, but it's not something that's always wrong. These two folks are disagreeing
1882320	1885600	with one another. They are contradicting one another. They cannot both be right.
1887840	1895440	If air's view is true, then they're not really contradicting one another, because really one of
1895520	1908960	them is just saying, boo, abortion. That's the first one. The other one is saying, okay, abortion.
1911520	1915360	They're not contradicting one each other, one another. If one person says boo, and the other
1915360	1920560	person says yay, and they're screaming back and forth at each other from across a stadium
1920560	1926240	at a sporting event, they're not arguing. Now, there's a sense in which there is a tension
1926240	1930720	between the sentiments that they are expressing. One of them feels a certain way, and the other
1930720	1935920	person feels a different way, and an individual person can't coherently feel both ways at the
1935920	1943200	same time. They can't, as it were, well, be in favor of something and be against it at the same time,
1943200	1948160	right? But that doesn't mean that the things that they've said contradict one another. They're not
1948160	1953920	productively disagreeing. Here's an example that goes back a little bit to subjectivism. Say that
1953920	1959840	I'm sitting at a table eating pickled tomatoes, and someone comes up to me and says, I don't like
1959840	1966320	pickled tomatoes. And I say, I do like pickled tomatoes. And they say, I don't like pickled
1966320	1975280	tomatoes. And I say, but I like them. We don't disagree with one another. We're just screaming
1975280	1980480	back and forth, and I'm talking about me, and this other person is talking about themselves.
1981440	1986160	And so we don't really disagree. There's a kind of confusion. We are, as it were, talking past
1986160	1992240	one another. If you're a subjectivist about moral talk, then you have to say that disagreements,
1992240	1997680	like this one, are really just two people shouting back and forth at each other when they're really
1997680	2001120	each talking about different things. One of them is talking about themselves, and the other one
2001120	2006400	is talking about themselves. And so too with air. Moral disagreements like this, it looks like
2006400	2009920	these people are arguing with one another, but they're not really arguing with one another.
2009920	2015200	One is just yelling boo, and one is just yelling yay. And here's Moore's claim.
2016480	2025120	Moral disagreements are real. They're genuine. They exist. And so any theory, Moore thinks,
2025120	2029280	that gets the results that there aren't moral disagreements, that theory is no good.
2029280	2035360	That's Moore's objection. Okay. What's air's response to Moore's objection?
2036880	2044880	All right. Air does something that in philosophy, we call biting the bullet.
2046400	2051040	You bite a bullet in real life. I mean, you probably hopefully will never bite a bullet.
2051040	2054960	You bite a bullet in real life when you have to do something really painful, like get surgery
2054960	2059520	without anesthesia. And you're supposed to bite the bullet in order to bear the pain.
2060560	2064960	So air is, as it were, going to take on something that's a little bit painful,
2064960	2068800	but he's going to do it to save his theory, which he thinks has many other advantages.
2069840	2076640	He just bites the bullet and accepts that we don't have genuine moral disagreements.
2076640	2086400	He denies that we have genuine moral disagreements. He says that it looks like we have genuine moral
2086400	2092480	disagreements, but we really don't. How can he possibly say that? It really seems like we have
2092480	2101680	moral disagreements. Here's a little bit of an argument for air's view that defends him from
2101760	2110720	Moore's objection. Say that we're talking about public policy, drug policy, right? Here's a moral
2110720	2116880	claim. Marijuana, that's just how I'm going to write marijuana because I don't know how to spell it,
2117440	2127200	marijuana should be legal. Let's say you think that. Well, if you do think that you're using
2127200	2131280	moral language, you're making a moral claim, you're talking about what should be the case.
2131280	2140080	You're talking about how our society ought to be arranged. What is the just way to arrange our
2140080	2146480	legal system and our laws? This is a moral statement if there ever was one, right? Marijuana should
2146480	2152960	be legal. Okay, say you were arguing for that claim or you were arguing against it. What might you
2152960	2160160	say? Think about it. Actually pause the video right now and make up an argument either for the
2160160	2166880	claim that marijuana should be legal or that it shouldn't. You didn't pause the video. No, you
2166880	2169840	don't really pause it. You're not actually going to think of something. You're just going to keep
2169840	2174240	on watching. Okay, well, listen. Here's what you could have said. Here's what you probably would
2174240	2181200	have said. You might have said something like this. Well, marijuana should be legal because
2181200	2189760	marijuana maybe stops seizures. Oh, I don't know how to spell seizures, but something like that.
2189760	2196320	Okay, marijuana stops seizures. You might argue in favor of marijuana legalization by making that
2196320	2206240	point. Or if you're an opponent of a marijuana legalization, you might say marijuana impairs
2206240	2217200	judgment impairs judgment. And that in turn causes car crashes, which cause death. We could go back
2217200	2224080	and forth about all of this sort of stuff. But did you notice something? This was a moral statement,
2224960	2229360	a normative statement about a statement about how things should be. But then when we started to
2229360	2235040	actually have this debate or started to have this discussion, all of the claims that we started
2235040	2246720	hearing were factual claims. They were factual claims. Factual. These ones are factual. This one
2247520	2254560	is moral or normative in at least some sense. But these are not claims about how things should be.
2254560	2260400	The fact that marijuana stops seizures, if it does, in some cases, is not a fact about how
2260880	2266160	things should be. It's a fact about how things are. It just is true that this chemical interacts with
2266160	2272240	this other chemical in this certain way. That's it. It's a factual claim. It's not a moral claim.
2272240	2278240	It's a factual claim. Same thing for marijuana causes impairment, which in turn causes car crashes
2278240	2283040	if you're driving. That's a factual claim. That's a claim about chemicals. Chemicals interacting
2283040	2288400	with other chemicals, chemicals in the marijuana, chemicals in your brain, nerves leading to your
2288400	2297440	hands and feet when you're driving. These are all factual claims. Ayer thinks this. He thinks that
2297440	2305680	when we are having disagreements that are genuine, they're not really moral. And when we're having
2305680	2313680	disagreements that are really moral, they're not really genuine. We can have a genuine disagreement
2314320	2320320	about, well, whether marijuana should be legal. But that's only because we're really at the
2320320	2328240	underlying level disagreeing about some factual claim, whether or not marijuana stops seizures
2328240	2332320	or whether or not marijuana has some other effects or something like that. We're just
2332320	2338800	disagreeing about factual things. We're able to have that disagreement because under the surface,
2339360	2346320	there is actually some degree of moral agreement. We agree about something. Namely, we agree,
2346880	2355920	well, we agree about something moral. We agree that stopping seizures, I still don't know how to
2355920	2363840	spell seizures, is good. That's a moral claim too. We agree about this. And it's only because we have
2363920	2369040	this kind of agreement. We have the same sentiments here that we're able to have this kind of
2369040	2375280	disagreement. Moore's claim is that we can have our sentiments aligned on certain things, on
2375280	2380160	certain matters. We can have the same sentiments. We would express them in the same thing. And then
2380160	2386960	when we get to the level of disagreement, really, we are disagreeing about factual things because
2386960	2394880	there's some underlying moral convergence. That's his response to Moore's objection, is that we don't
2394880	2401120	have genuine moral disagreements, or at least not nearly as often as we think we do, what we have
2401120	2409920	are moral agreements and genuine non-moral disagreements. Now, we are able to explain what
2409920	2415680	I think is the most difficult sentence in the reading. So right now, I'm going to explain to
2415680	2422480	you, given everything I just said, what this very difficult sentence said. So let me get the sentence.
2425520	2432000	Here's the sentence. It happens on the bottom of page 111. And I'm going to write it up now,
2432000	2436720	and then we're going to use everything that we just said, our understanding of Aire's view,
2436720	2441840	our understanding of subjectivism, and Moore's objection to subjectivism, and then Aire's response
2441840	2448000	to Moore's objection. We're going to use all of that to understand what this sentence says. Okay, here it is.
2451440	2459440	Let's go through it real slow. If our opponent concurs with us in expressing moral disapproval
2459440	2467040	of all actions of a given type T, then we may get him to condemn a particular action A by bringing
2467040	2474320	forward arguments to show that A is of type T. Okay, what's going on? The background is that Moore
2474320	2482080	is talking about how actual moral disagreements work, how we actually try to persuade one another
2482720	2490880	to change our minds about moral matters. Suppose you wanted to convince some people
2490880	2497200	that marijuana should be illegal. You were Jeff Sessions or something like that. You want to convince
2497200	2511120	folks that marijuana, I really hope that's how you spell it, right, should be illegal. Okay,
2512640	2518640	you want to convince someone of that fact. How do you go about doing it? Well, we just heard
2519200	2525440	that Aire's response to Moore involved him saying that underneath this disagreement,
2525440	2529840	where one person thinks that it should be illegal, and the other person thinks it's fine, it should
2529840	2536240	be legal, right, underneath this disagreement are factual disagreements, and then underneath those
2536240	2545120	factual disagreements are moral agreements, right. So here's something, here's something that, well,
2545120	2549920	if you're Jeff Sessions and you're trying to argue for this, you know that your opponent is going to
2549920	2558080	agree with you about, okay. They're going to agree with you that we're talking about behavior that
2558080	2563440	leads to murder. Everyone is going to agree that that's bad. They're going to have the same negative
2563440	2572480	sentiments towards that, right. Okay, everyone agrees that this is bad. Let's call this type of
2572480	2585760	behavior, behavior type T. Behavior type T is any behavior that leads to murder. Okay, and then
2585760	2592960	let's talk about some more specific type of behavior, behavior type A, and this will be
2592960	2598800	smoking marijuana. Let's say you were Jeff Sessions, you thought that marijuana was terrible,
2598800	2603600	it should be illegal. You know that everyone agrees with you that if something leads to murder,
2604240	2611520	then it should be illegal too. So you just have to, well, make a factual claim. You make the
2611520	2621040	following factual claim that this type of behavior, smoking marijuana, is really just some of this
2621040	2627680	type of behavior. It's a subset. Smoking marijuana is one type of behavior that leads to murder,
2627680	2632560	and you do this with science or made up science if you don't have real science to back you up,
2632560	2639040	right, or whatever you're going to use, right. This is a factual claim. The factual claim is that
2639600	2645760	smoking marijuana is a type of behavior that leads to murder. That's a factual claim.
2646800	2654800	Ayer is saying that this sort of thing is what goes on when we have moral disagreements, right,
2654800	2660960	and that his theory is perfectly able to explain this. All right, let's go back to the quote.
2660960	2668640	Let's read it again. If our opponent concurs with us, so if our opponent agrees with us, if we all
2668640	2676480	agree, what do we agree about? We agree in expressing moral disapproval of all actions of a given type
2676560	2688080	T. So we all disapprove of anything that leads to murder, right? Okay, so we all agree that this
2688080	2697520	is to be disapproved of, any action of a given type T. Then we may get him our opponent, okay,
2698240	2704800	we may get our opponent to condemn a particular action A, right, so we want to condemn A. You're
2704800	2712960	Jeff Sessions, you want to condemn A, right? We may get him to condemn, we may get our opponent
2712960	2722560	to condemn this by bringing forward arguments to show that A is of type T, to show that this
2722560	2727760	is really of this type, that this is the claim. Now, I'm not saying it's true and I'm not saying
2727760	2733120	it's false, I'm just saying that according to Ayer, this is the kind of moral argument that we
2733120	2740880	make. We say that this type of action is really of this type of action and we already agree in
2740880	2748960	condemning this type of action and so by making this factual claim, it's a factual claim to say
2748960	2754480	that smoking marijuana leads to murder, that's just a factual claim, that's not a moral claim,
2754480	2760400	right? This kind of factual claim is the kind of claim that we actually disagree about and that
2760400	2766000	that's what's really at the heart of moral disagreements. One last thing before we're done.
2768640	2775360	We've said all these things about Ayer's theory and Ayer's theory one more time is a theory of
2775360	2786080	moral talk or moral language, not of morality itself. Why again do we care about moral talk
2786080	2793920	or moral language? The answer, I've already said this but it's worth repeating, is that if you want
2793920	2803360	to be a moral skeptic, if you want to deny that there really is any such thing as morality,
2804240	2809680	then you're going to need to explain all of the moral talk. Are you going to say that it's all
2809680	2816000	false? Ayer is able to say if he's right about moral talk, which he might not be, but if he's
2816000	2820960	right about it then he's able to say that, well, morality is not real but we don't have to throw
2820960	2826480	out all of our moral discourse and all of our moral language, that's fine. We disagree about
2826480	2834800	factual matters that are underlying our moral debates and when we do express moral sentiments,
2834800	2841360	we do so in a way that doesn't also assert that things are true. So we don't have to throw out
2841360	2846080	all of our moral talk because it's all false, just because we're moral skeptics, because moral
2846080	2850320	talk was never the kind of thing that was true or false in the first place.
