0	6700	I want you to hit me as hard as you can."
6700	11540	In the year 2006, Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest, reigned supreme at the
11540	16700	box office, while the Boston crime saga, The Departed, led to the first and only Oscar
16700	18860	for director Martin Scorsese.
18860	23380	But in the 15 years since then, one other film has also become a cultural milestone
23380	26300	due to its weirdly prescient views of the future.
26300	30100	A film so neglected in its initial release that the studio didn't even bother to make
30100	31460	a trailer for it.
31460	36780	Dubbed the smartest stupid movie ever made, Idiocracy was barely a box office blip when
36780	39900	it was quietly released in September 2006.
39900	44460	Why was this film from renowned creator Mike Judge tossed aside and left to die by the
44460	45700	studio?
45700	55380	Mutilate your thirst as we find out what the f*** happened to this movie.
55380	58420	Mike Judge is no prophet, just an average guy.
58420	62260	Born in Ecuador and raised in New Mexico, Judge would later graduate from University
62260	65420	of California, San Diego, with a degree in physics.
65420	70300	But after working several menial jobs in his chosen field, he found himself getting bored,
70300	73780	so he did what every person does when they don't like physics anymore, become a bass
73780	78220	player for the Shamu Band at SeaWorld in San Diego, and follow that by touring with
78220	82340	blues musicians Anson Funderberg and Doyle Bramhall.
82340	87180	At this point, Judge had also started messing around with animation, even purchasing a 16mm
87180	89940	camera to make his own animated shorts.
89940	94340	This led to the creation of Frog Baseball, based on a conversation he once overheard
94340	97140	where two people actually discussed such a thing.
97140	99620	Judge thought to himself, who the hell would do that?
99620	101680	How about Beavis and Butthead?
101680	105980	This short, which aired as part of the MTV series Liquid Television, was so popular that
105980	110860	it led to MTV signing Judge to create the now iconic series Beavis and Butthead.
110860	115820	The show aired nearly 200 episodes in the span of just 5 years, with many critics accusing
115820	122540	the show of being responsible for the dumbing down of America.
122540	126260	That controversy didn't matter, as Beavis and Butthead has become one of television's
126260	132300	longest lasting properties, with a successful theatrical film in 1996, a new season in 2011,
132300	134260	and more soon to come.
134260	138580	Judge would make the leap to live action with Office Space, based on his animated Milton
138580	142580	shorts, another case of the creator taking inspiration from real life.
142580	146500	The character was based on an actual man he had worked with in his engineering days.
146500	149940	Judge noticed that no one would ever talk to the man, so one day he stopped and said
149940	154020	hi, and that simple gesture gave the man the audience he had been waiting for to unload
154020	157780	all of his frustrations, including a threat to burn the building down if they moved his
157780	159340	desk again.
159340	162980	Even though we now think of Office Space as a modern classic, it was actually a blink
162980	164660	and you'll miss it affair.
164660	168380	Even before its release, the studio showed very little faith in the film, telling Judge
168380	172140	he needed to amp up the energy and get rid of the gangster rap.
172140	176740	Leading up to its release in February 1999, the marketing left a lot to be desired, with
176740	180920	Judge and several cast members absolutely hating the theatrical poster of a man covered
180920	185620	in Post-it notes, making it look more like an ad for Big Bird or Office Depot, not a
185620	187180	comedy film.
187180	190300	Office Space would only make $10 million in theaters.
190300	194940	One studio head reportedly told Judge, nobody wants to see your little movie about ordinary
194940	197520	people and their boring little lives.
197520	201120	Even though Office Space crashed and burned theatrically, it quickly gained a following
201120	205440	on home video, particularly with viewers who could sympathize with its eerily accurate
205440	208400	depiction of 9-to-5 cubicle life.
208400	213520	Because of that eventual success, 20th Century Fox was anticipating Judge's next project.
213520	217960	It took a few years, but eventually Judge pitched his idea for idiocracy.
217960	222240	The concept of a society that gradually gets dumber is actually not a new one, previously
222240	227800	explored in stories like Cyril M. Cornbluth's 1951 short The Marching Morons.
227800	232400	But Judge credited his inspiration for the idea to a trip he once had taken to Disneyland.
232400	236720	While he and his daughter stood in line waiting for a ride, two nearby women, each with children
236720	240840	and strollers, began arguing loudly and screaming profanities.
240840	244360	This prompted Judge to think, is this the future Walt Disney had envisioned for his
244360	245360	theme park?
245360	250200	He also thought about the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey, contemplating a different futuristic
250200	254440	setting where instead of the monolith and everything being pristine and advanced, what
254440	257720	if it was the Jerry Springer show and giant Walmarts?
257720	262120	When Judge sat down to write the script, which was then titled The United States of America,
262120	265000	he used his own school experience as a guideline.
265000	268760	When a teacher would be disappointed in the class's test scores and point out that Judge
268760	272960	was the only student who did well, the other school kids would be furious and say, we are
272960	275320	going to beat the shit out of you after class.
275320	278880	So when writing the movie, he essentially imagined his junior high class taking over
278880	280320	the world.
280320	283760	Once the production got rolling, the film's cast came together quickly with Luke Wilson
283760	289840	as ordinary guy Joe Bowers, later known as Not Sure, a remarkably unremarkable army librarian
289840	293120	selected for a suspended animation experiment that goes wrong.
293120	299360	He's joined by SNL regular Maya Rudolph as prostitute and future First Lady Rita, Dax
299360	305400	Shepard as avid TV watcher and lawyer Frito Pendejo, and Terry Crews as President Dwayne
305400	310440	Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, a role he auditioned for several times, even telling
310440	315600	the casting director, if you can find anyone better than me for this role, cast him immediately.
315600	321000	The movie, tentatively retitled 3001, filmed around Texas in 2004.
321000	325000	According to the cast and crew, it was a relatively straightforward and fun shoot, but behind
325000	328680	the scenes, Judge was dealing with headache after headache from the studio.
328680	332340	The budget was only a few million dollars, but they were nickel and diming him, refusing
332340	334880	to pay for several visual effects shots.
334880	339000	This resulted in Judge asking his friend, Robert Rodriguez, to do some of the shots,
339000	342160	which the filmmaker kindly supplied free of charge.
342160	346280	Another hassle Judge experienced was making sure his futuristic movie actually seemed
346280	349800	like it was set in the future, which meant choosing wardrobe that could be plausible
349800	351720	500 years from now.
351720	355120	One day, the production's costume designer brought in some clunky footwear that was
355120	356520	made of plastic.
356520	360000	Judge thought, look at these stupid plastic shoes, you'd have to be an idiot to wear
360000	361000	them.
361000	364260	He was wary of using them in the film out of concern they could actually become popular
364260	367780	by the time it was released, but he was assured that could never happen.
367780	370940	Cut to two years later and crocs were everywhere.
370940	374940	Another time Judge wasn't far off from reality was when he shot two minutes of just a bare
374940	378660	butt for the movie within a movie titled simply, Ass.
378660	383260	The crew went to a reform school and used 250 students for a scene where a packed movie
383260	387020	theater audience can't stop laughing at this quote-unquote film.
387020	390660	Judge assumed he would have to direct the crowd, since a movie featuring just a flatulent
390660	393580	butt surely wouldn't make any sense without context.
393580	398300	To his surprise and dismay, the audience all started laughing without direction and couldn't
398300	399300	stop.
399300	402260	Judge turned to his director of photography and pondered why they were even bothering
402260	405340	to make idiocracy when they could just release this.
405340	408580	But the film's true challenges came after production wrapped.
408580	413260	Test screenings began in March 2005, yielding some pretty terrible results.
413260	417500	The cast and crew reconvened for reshoots to address some of the problems, and the second
417500	420860	round of test screenings garnered much higher results.
420860	423980	Judge in the studio butted heads over how to market the movie.
423980	429420	Judge felt burned by how Fox mishandled Office Space and didn't want the same fate for idiocracy.
429420	433220	He said the studio was treating it like some kind of deep, what-if-time-travel-was-real
433220	437780	movie, and not what he said it actually was, the story of an average guy who winds up in
437780	440940	a stupid future.
440940	445060	With Office Space a newly minted cult hit and Beavis and Butthead still popular, you
445060	448980	might think Fox would have launched a heavy marketing campaign to let the world know something
448980	450900	new was coming from Mike Judge.
450900	453380	And yet, for months, silence.
453380	456940	Idiocracy sat on the shelf for over a year, and no one involved with the film knew what
456940	458300	was going on.
458300	462340	Judge speculated that with Office Space, the studio spent millions on advertising, only
462340	466500	for the film to fail theatrically but become a hit-on-home video, and perhaps the studio
466500	469860	was thinking the same thing would happen with idiocracy, so why spend money to promote
469860	470860	it?
470860	474060	Others claim that Fox was simply disappointed because they were under the impression that
474060	478180	idiocracy was going to be dumb yet funny, like Beavis and Butthead, and instead what
478180	481420	they got was a funny movie that makes fun of the dumb.
481420	485220	But the consensus seems to be that Fox got cold feet when the companies that had allowed
485220	492060	their brands to be used in the movie got wind that their brands were actually being mocked.
492060	495700	While making the film, the studio's lawyers actually told Judge to make fun of several
495700	499580	big name brands as a way to get them all to agree, as opposed to only choosing one or
499580	502500	two and having them feel like they were being singled out.
502500	505380	This led to the creation of the Red Light District scene.
505380	509420	Allegedly, prior to the movie's release, several of these companies complained to Fox about
509420	513660	their depictions, and not wanting to hurt potential future sponsorships, the studio
513660	516060	agreed to bury the movie.
516060	519820	Just months before the film's release, Judge was interviewed by Esquire magazine about
519820	520820	his career.
520820	524300	During the interview, Judge was waiting for Fox to call and allow him to show the reporter
524300	526140	the trailer for Idiocracy.
526140	528220	The call from the studio never came.
528220	532180	In fact, no theatrical trailer was released prior to the film hitting theaters.
532180	534580	No press screenings were given to reviewers.
534580	538660	There were no ads of any kind, say for a single theatrical poster, something a former
538660	542340	marketing head at Fox said he had never seen before.
542340	547540	Idiocracy was released on only 130 screens in September 2006, with many accusing the
547540	552380	studio of giving it a theatrical release purely to fulfill a contractual obligation.
552380	556980	Fox even went so far as to label the movie Untitled Mike Judge Comedy on popular ticketing
556980	561140	sites like Moviefone and Fandango, creating confusion for people that may have actually
561140	563100	been looking for Idiocracy.
563100	566580	With all of that working against it, it's no wonder the film only managed to take in
566580	570060	less than half a million dollars in its entire theatrical run.
570060	574100	The movie that the studio clearly wanted to fail did just that.
574100	575780	But then something happened.
575780	579700	Critics who were denied an early screening finally saw the film and began praising it,
579700	582820	hailing it as the most potent political film of the year.
582820	586860	Variety critic Robert Kohler called it daring, saying it was one of the few films with any
586860	588140	ideas.
588140	591820	With the movie getting a quick turnaround to home video, people were finally able to see
591820	597780	Idiocracy and see what they did as it amassed over 9 million dollars in home video rentals.
597780	601980	For most movies, that would be where the story ends, but for Idiocracy, that's only part
601980	603060	of the story.
603060	606780	When Judge sat down to write this movie, he exaggerated to such extremes that he never
606780	610060	thought they would actually come true, at least in his lifetime.
610060	614140	When asked about this in a recent interview, he commented, I'm no profit, I was off by
614140	615780	about 490 years.
615780	620700	There have been countless videos made comparing a certain political leader's speeches to
620700	624780	those by President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho.
624780	629740	Fox even shut down the possibility of Terry Crews reprising his role as President Dwayne
629740	635260	Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho for a series of fake campaign ads before the 2016
635260	636460	US election.
636460	641300	The studio feared the comedic videos would be viewed by some as attack ads.
641300	645300	Even the movie's jokes that seemed outrageous, like the Secretary of State being sponsored
645300	646300	by Carl's Jr.
646540	654620	Practically became prophecy when the actual CEO of Carl's Jr. was nominated to become
654620	657300	the United States Secretary of Labor.
657300	660980	But it's not just political aspects that have made Idiocracy so relevant.
660980	665660	Its depiction of a society reliant on pictures for communication mimics the growing obsession
665660	667220	with emojis.
667220	671420	The film shows a world where curse words are no longer taboo, but used as powerful marketing
671420	674020	tools, which seems familiar.
674020	678260	Much like the movie's omnipresent fluid, Brando, we would actually come to see COVID
678260	683060	testing sites shamelessly sponsored by big-name stores and drink companies.
683060	687940	Even a show like Ow My Balls, or a clash between phallic monster trucks, don't seem like they
687940	693060	would be that out of place on one of today's countless cable channels and streaming services.
693060	698100	Corporate mega-mergers, like the movies AT&T, Time Warner, Taco Bell, have practically become
698100	699100	reality.
699100	704300	So further than Disney's acquisitions of giant brands like Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel, and
704300	707180	Idiocracy's owner, 20th Century Fox.
707180	712060	Perhaps most outlandish of all was the movie's concept of coffee shops that also offered sexual
712060	713060	favors.
713060	721540	Who would imagine that would become a real thing?
721540	725820	And yet there's the real-life Falatio Cafe, located in Geneva, Switzerland.
725980	729620	Sure, it's not Starbucks, but are we really that far off?
729620	734540	In 2017, Mike Judge was being interviewed on the Sony lot by The New York Times.
734540	739700	Tom Rothman, head of Fox at the time of Idiocracy's release, interrupted them to admit that Idiocracy's
739700	744140	failure was entirely his fault, to which Judge quickly replied, I agree.
744140	747620	Rothman said that Judge and the film were ahead of their time, and perhaps the movie
747620	749980	was made 10 years too early.
749980	754620	The past few years have seen a rise in comparisons between Idiocracy and the real world.
754620	759580	In the respected Time Magazine, published an article titled, We Have Become an Idiocracy.
759580	762540	The term has become so much more than just the title of a great movie.
762540	767180	It's now used regularly when something moronic happens, and the press dubs it an Idiocracy
767180	768660	moment.
768660	773060	Three years after Idiocracy, Judge would return to directing with the comedy Extract, which
773060	776860	he financed independently after learning his lessons dealing with studios.
776860	781460	Otherwise, he's been busy, with the short-lived animated show The Good Family, creating the
781460	788220	hit HBO series Silicon Valley, and more adolescent debauchery with new Beavis and Butthead material.
788220	791760	Mike Judge has said that with Office Space, it was such a sweet success when it found
791760	796580	an audience after the fact, but with Idiocracy, he doesn't feel that same sense of pride,
796580	800980	because that film's success has come at the expense of the dumbing down of America.
800980	803880	After all, he never dreamed he was making a documentary.
803880	806100	And yet, here we are.
