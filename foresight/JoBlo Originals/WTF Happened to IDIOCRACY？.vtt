WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.700
I want you to hit me as hard as you can."

00:06.700 --> 00:11.540
In the year 2006, Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest, reigned supreme at the

00:11.540 --> 00:16.700
box office, while the Boston crime saga, The Departed, led to the first and only Oscar

00:16.700 --> 00:18.860
for director Martin Scorsese.

00:18.860 --> 00:23.380
But in the 15 years since then, one other film has also become a cultural milestone

00:23.380 --> 00:26.300
due to its weirdly prescient views of the future.

00:26.300 --> 00:30.100
A film so neglected in its initial release that the studio didn't even bother to make

00:30.100 --> 00:31.460
a trailer for it.

00:31.460 --> 00:36.780
Dubbed the smartest stupid movie ever made, Idiocracy was barely a box office blip when

00:36.780 --> 00:39.900
it was quietly released in September 2006.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.460
Why was this film from renowned creator Mike Judge tossed aside and left to die by the

00:44.460 --> 00:45.700
studio?

00:45.700 --> 00:55.380
Mutilate your thirst as we find out what the f*** happened to this movie.

00:55.380 --> 00:58.420
Mike Judge is no prophet, just an average guy.

00:58.420 --> 01:02.260
Born in Ecuador and raised in New Mexico, Judge would later graduate from University

01:02.260 --> 01:05.420
of California, San Diego, with a degree in physics.

01:05.420 --> 01:10.300
But after working several menial jobs in his chosen field, he found himself getting bored,

01:10.300 --> 01:13.780
so he did what every person does when they don't like physics anymore, become a bass

01:13.780 --> 01:18.220
player for the Shamu Band at SeaWorld in San Diego, and follow that by touring with

01:18.220 --> 01:22.340
blues musicians Anson Funderberg and Doyle Bramhall.

01:22.340 --> 01:27.180
At this point, Judge had also started messing around with animation, even purchasing a 16mm

01:27.180 --> 01:29.940
camera to make his own animated shorts.

01:29.940 --> 01:34.340
This led to the creation of Frog Baseball, based on a conversation he once overheard

01:34.340 --> 01:37.140
where two people actually discussed such a thing.

01:37.140 --> 01:39.620
Judge thought to himself, who the hell would do that?

01:39.620 --> 01:41.680
How about Beavis and Butthead?

01:41.680 --> 01:45.980
This short, which aired as part of the MTV series Liquid Television, was so popular that

01:45.980 --> 01:50.860
it led to MTV signing Judge to create the now iconic series Beavis and Butthead.

01:50.860 --> 01:55.820
The show aired nearly 200 episodes in the span of just 5 years, with many critics accusing

01:55.820 --> 02:02.540
the show of being responsible for the dumbing down of America.

02:02.540 --> 02:06.260
That controversy didn't matter, as Beavis and Butthead has become one of television's

02:06.260 --> 02:12.300
longest lasting properties, with a successful theatrical film in 1996, a new season in 2011,

02:12.300 --> 02:14.260
and more soon to come.

02:14.260 --> 02:18.580
Judge would make the leap to live action with Office Space, based on his animated Milton

02:18.580 --> 02:22.580
shorts, another case of the creator taking inspiration from real life.

02:22.580 --> 02:26.500
The character was based on an actual man he had worked with in his engineering days.

02:26.500 --> 02:29.940
Judge noticed that no one would ever talk to the man, so one day he stopped and said

02:29.940 --> 02:34.020
hi, and that simple gesture gave the man the audience he had been waiting for to unload

02:34.020 --> 02:37.780
all of his frustrations, including a threat to burn the building down if they moved his

02:37.780 --> 02:39.340
desk again.

02:39.340 --> 02:42.980
Even though we now think of Office Space as a modern classic, it was actually a blink

02:42.980 --> 02:44.660
and you'll miss it affair.

02:44.660 --> 02:48.380
Even before its release, the studio showed very little faith in the film, telling Judge

02:48.380 --> 02:52.140
he needed to amp up the energy and get rid of the gangster rap.

02:52.140 --> 02:56.740
Leading up to its release in February 1999, the marketing left a lot to be desired, with

02:56.740 --> 03:00.920
Judge and several cast members absolutely hating the theatrical poster of a man covered

03:00.920 --> 03:05.620
in Post-it notes, making it look more like an ad for Big Bird or Office Depot, not a

03:05.620 --> 03:07.180
comedy film.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.300
Office Space would only make $10 million in theaters.

03:10.300 --> 03:14.940
One studio head reportedly told Judge, nobody wants to see your little movie about ordinary

03:14.940 --> 03:17.520
people and their boring little lives.

03:17.520 --> 03:21.120
Even though Office Space crashed and burned theatrically, it quickly gained a following

03:21.120 --> 03:25.440
on home video, particularly with viewers who could sympathize with its eerily accurate

03:25.440 --> 03:28.400
depiction of 9-to-5 cubicle life.

03:28.400 --> 03:33.520
Because of that eventual success, 20th Century Fox was anticipating Judge's next project.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.960
It took a few years, but eventually Judge pitched his idea for idiocracy.

03:37.960 --> 03:42.240
The concept of a society that gradually gets dumber is actually not a new one, previously

03:42.240 --> 03:47.800
explored in stories like Cyril M. Cornbluth's 1951 short The Marching Morons.

03:47.800 --> 03:52.400
But Judge credited his inspiration for the idea to a trip he once had taken to Disneyland.

03:52.400 --> 03:56.720
While he and his daughter stood in line waiting for a ride, two nearby women, each with children

03:56.720 --> 04:00.840
and strollers, began arguing loudly and screaming profanities.

04:00.840 --> 04:04.360
This prompted Judge to think, is this the future Walt Disney had envisioned for his

04:04.360 --> 04:05.360
theme park?

04:05.360 --> 04:10.200
He also thought about the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey, contemplating a different futuristic

04:10.200 --> 04:14.440
setting where instead of the monolith and everything being pristine and advanced, what

04:14.440 --> 04:17.720
if it was the Jerry Springer show and giant Walmarts?

04:17.720 --> 04:22.120
When Judge sat down to write the script, which was then titled The United States of America,

04:22.120 --> 04:25.000
he used his own school experience as a guideline.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.760
When a teacher would be disappointed in the class's test scores and point out that Judge

04:28.760 --> 04:32.960
was the only student who did well, the other school kids would be furious and say, we are

04:32.960 --> 04:35.320
going to beat the shit out of you after class.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.880
So when writing the movie, he essentially imagined his junior high class taking over

04:38.880 --> 04:40.320
the world.

04:40.320 --> 04:43.760
Once the production got rolling, the film's cast came together quickly with Luke Wilson

04:43.760 --> 04:49.840
as ordinary guy Joe Bowers, later known as Not Sure, a remarkably unremarkable army librarian

04:49.840 --> 04:53.120
selected for a suspended animation experiment that goes wrong.

04:53.120 --> 04:59.360
He's joined by SNL regular Maya Rudolph as prostitute and future First Lady Rita, Dax

04:59.360 --> 05:05.400
Shepard as avid TV watcher and lawyer Frito Pendejo, and Terry Crews as President Dwayne

05:05.400 --> 05:10.440
Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, a role he auditioned for several times, even telling

05:10.440 --> 05:15.600
the casting director, if you can find anyone better than me for this role, cast him immediately.

05:15.600 --> 05:21.000
The movie, tentatively retitled 3001, filmed around Texas in 2004.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
According to the cast and crew, it was a relatively straightforward and fun shoot, but behind

05:25.000 --> 05:28.680
the scenes, Judge was dealing with headache after headache from the studio.

05:28.680 --> 05:32.340
The budget was only a few million dollars, but they were nickel and diming him, refusing

05:32.340 --> 05:34.880
to pay for several visual effects shots.

05:34.880 --> 05:39.000
This resulted in Judge asking his friend, Robert Rodriguez, to do some of the shots,

05:39.000 --> 05:42.160
which the filmmaker kindly supplied free of charge.

05:42.160 --> 05:46.280
Another hassle Judge experienced was making sure his futuristic movie actually seemed

05:46.280 --> 05:49.800
like it was set in the future, which meant choosing wardrobe that could be plausible

05:49.800 --> 05:51.720
500 years from now.

05:51.720 --> 05:55.120
One day, the production's costume designer brought in some clunky footwear that was

05:55.120 --> 05:56.520
made of plastic.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.000
Judge thought, look at these stupid plastic shoes, you'd have to be an idiot to wear

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
them.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.260
He was wary of using them in the film out of concern they could actually become popular

06:04.260 --> 06:07.780
by the time it was released, but he was assured that could never happen.

06:07.780 --> 06:10.940
Cut to two years later and crocs were everywhere.

06:10.940 --> 06:14.940
Another time Judge wasn't far off from reality was when he shot two minutes of just a bare

06:14.940 --> 06:18.660
butt for the movie within a movie titled simply, Ass.

06:18.660 --> 06:23.260
The crew went to a reform school and used 250 students for a scene where a packed movie

06:23.260 --> 06:27.020
theater audience can't stop laughing at this quote-unquote film.

06:27.020 --> 06:30.660
Judge assumed he would have to direct the crowd, since a movie featuring just a flatulent

06:30.660 --> 06:33.580
butt surely wouldn't make any sense without context.

06:33.580 --> 06:38.300
To his surprise and dismay, the audience all started laughing without direction and couldn't

06:38.300 --> 06:39.300
stop.

06:39.300 --> 06:42.260
Judge turned to his director of photography and pondered why they were even bothering

06:42.260 --> 06:45.340
to make idiocracy when they could just release this.

06:45.340 --> 06:48.580
But the film's true challenges came after production wrapped.

06:48.580 --> 06:53.260
Test screenings began in March 2005, yielding some pretty terrible results.

06:53.260 --> 06:57.500
The cast and crew reconvened for reshoots to address some of the problems, and the second

06:57.500 --> 07:00.860
round of test screenings garnered much higher results.

07:00.860 --> 07:03.980
Judge in the studio butted heads over how to market the movie.

07:03.980 --> 07:09.420
Judge felt burned by how Fox mishandled Office Space and didn't want the same fate for idiocracy.

07:09.420 --> 07:13.220
He said the studio was treating it like some kind of deep, what-if-time-travel-was-real

07:13.220 --> 07:17.780
movie, and not what he said it actually was, the story of an average guy who winds up in

07:17.780 --> 07:20.940
a stupid future.

07:20.940 --> 07:25.060
With Office Space a newly minted cult hit and Beavis and Butthead still popular, you

07:25.060 --> 07:28.980
might think Fox would have launched a heavy marketing campaign to let the world know something

07:28.980 --> 07:30.900
new was coming from Mike Judge.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.380
And yet, for months, silence.

07:33.380 --> 07:36.940
Idiocracy sat on the shelf for over a year, and no one involved with the film knew what

07:36.940 --> 07:38.300
was going on.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.340
Judge speculated that with Office Space, the studio spent millions on advertising, only

07:42.340 --> 07:46.500
for the film to fail theatrically but become a hit-on-home video, and perhaps the studio

07:46.500 --> 07:49.860
was thinking the same thing would happen with idiocracy, so why spend money to promote

07:49.860 --> 07:50.860
it?

07:50.860 --> 07:54.060
Others claim that Fox was simply disappointed because they were under the impression that

07:54.060 --> 07:58.180
idiocracy was going to be dumb yet funny, like Beavis and Butthead, and instead what

07:58.180 --> 08:01.420
they got was a funny movie that makes fun of the dumb.

08:01.420 --> 08:05.220
But the consensus seems to be that Fox got cold feet when the companies that had allowed

08:05.220 --> 08:12.060
their brands to be used in the movie got wind that their brands were actually being mocked.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.700
While making the film, the studio's lawyers actually told Judge to make fun of several

08:15.700 --> 08:19.580
big name brands as a way to get them all to agree, as opposed to only choosing one or

08:19.580 --> 08:22.500
two and having them feel like they were being singled out.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.380
This led to the creation of the Red Light District scene.

08:25.380 --> 08:29.420
Allegedly, prior to the movie's release, several of these companies complained to Fox about

08:29.420 --> 08:33.660
their depictions, and not wanting to hurt potential future sponsorships, the studio

08:33.660 --> 08:36.060
agreed to bury the movie.

08:36.060 --> 08:39.820
Just months before the film's release, Judge was interviewed by Esquire magazine about

08:39.820 --> 08:40.820
his career.

08:40.820 --> 08:44.300
During the interview, Judge was waiting for Fox to call and allow him to show the reporter

08:44.300 --> 08:46.140
the trailer for Idiocracy.

08:46.140 --> 08:48.220
The call from the studio never came.

08:48.220 --> 08:52.180
In fact, no theatrical trailer was released prior to the film hitting theaters.

08:52.180 --> 08:54.580
No press screenings were given to reviewers.

08:54.580 --> 08:58.660
There were no ads of any kind, say for a single theatrical poster, something a former

08:58.660 --> 09:02.340
marketing head at Fox said he had never seen before.

09:02.340 --> 09:07.540
Idiocracy was released on only 130 screens in September 2006, with many accusing the

09:07.540 --> 09:12.380
studio of giving it a theatrical release purely to fulfill a contractual obligation.

09:12.380 --> 09:16.980
Fox even went so far as to label the movie Untitled Mike Judge Comedy on popular ticketing

09:16.980 --> 09:21.140
sites like Moviefone and Fandango, creating confusion for people that may have actually

09:21.140 --> 09:23.100
been looking for Idiocracy.

09:23.100 --> 09:26.580
With all of that working against it, it's no wonder the film only managed to take in

09:26.580 --> 09:30.060
less than half a million dollars in its entire theatrical run.

09:30.060 --> 09:34.100
The movie that the studio clearly wanted to fail did just that.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.780
But then something happened.

09:35.780 --> 09:39.700
Critics who were denied an early screening finally saw the film and began praising it,

09:39.700 --> 09:42.820
hailing it as the most potent political film of the year.

09:42.820 --> 09:46.860
Variety critic Robert Kohler called it daring, saying it was one of the few films with any

09:46.860 --> 09:48.140
ideas.

09:48.140 --> 09:51.820
With the movie getting a quick turnaround to home video, people were finally able to see

09:51.820 --> 09:57.780
Idiocracy and see what they did as it amassed over 9 million dollars in home video rentals.

09:57.780 --> 10:01.980
For most movies, that would be where the story ends, but for Idiocracy, that's only part

10:01.980 --> 10:03.060
of the story.

10:03.060 --> 10:06.780
When Judge sat down to write this movie, he exaggerated to such extremes that he never

10:06.780 --> 10:10.060
thought they would actually come true, at least in his lifetime.

10:10.060 --> 10:14.140
When asked about this in a recent interview, he commented, I'm no profit, I was off by

10:14.140 --> 10:15.780
about 490 years.

10:15.780 --> 10:20.700
There have been countless videos made comparing a certain political leader's speeches to

10:20.700 --> 10:24.780
those by President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho.

10:24.780 --> 10:29.740
Fox even shut down the possibility of Terry Crews reprising his role as President Dwayne

10:29.740 --> 10:35.260
Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho for a series of fake campaign ads before the 2016

10:35.260 --> 10:36.460
US election.

10:36.460 --> 10:41.300
The studio feared the comedic videos would be viewed by some as attack ads.

10:41.300 --> 10:45.300
Even the movie's jokes that seemed outrageous, like the Secretary of State being sponsored

10:45.300 --> 10:46.300
by Carl's Jr.

10:46.540 --> 10:54.620
Practically became prophecy when the actual CEO of Carl's Jr. was nominated to become

10:54.620 --> 10:57.300
the United States Secretary of Labor.

10:57.300 --> 11:00.980
But it's not just political aspects that have made Idiocracy so relevant.

11:00.980 --> 11:05.660
Its depiction of a society reliant on pictures for communication mimics the growing obsession

11:05.660 --> 11:07.220
with emojis.

11:07.220 --> 11:11.420
The film shows a world where curse words are no longer taboo, but used as powerful marketing

11:11.420 --> 11:14.020
tools, which seems familiar.

11:14.020 --> 11:18.260
Much like the movie's omnipresent fluid, Brando, we would actually come to see COVID

11:18.260 --> 11:23.060
testing sites shamelessly sponsored by big-name stores and drink companies.

11:23.060 --> 11:27.940
Even a show like Ow My Balls, or a clash between phallic monster trucks, don't seem like they

11:27.940 --> 11:33.060
would be that out of place on one of today's countless cable channels and streaming services.

11:33.060 --> 11:38.100
Corporate mega-mergers, like the movies AT&T, Time Warner, Taco Bell, have practically become

11:38.100 --> 11:39.100
reality.

11:39.100 --> 11:44.300
So further than Disney's acquisitions of giant brands like Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel, and

11:44.300 --> 11:47.180
Idiocracy's owner, 20th Century Fox.

11:47.180 --> 11:52.060
Perhaps most outlandish of all was the movie's concept of coffee shops that also offered sexual

11:52.060 --> 11:53.060
favors.

11:53.060 --> 12:01.540
Who would imagine that would become a real thing?

12:01.540 --> 12:05.820
And yet there's the real-life Falatio Cafe, located in Geneva, Switzerland.

12:05.980 --> 12:09.620
Sure, it's not Starbucks, but are we really that far off?

12:09.620 --> 12:14.540
In 2017, Mike Judge was being interviewed on the Sony lot by The New York Times.

12:14.540 --> 12:19.700
Tom Rothman, head of Fox at the time of Idiocracy's release, interrupted them to admit that Idiocracy's

12:19.700 --> 12:24.140
failure was entirely his fault, to which Judge quickly replied, I agree.

12:24.140 --> 12:27.620
Rothman said that Judge and the film were ahead of their time, and perhaps the movie

12:27.620 --> 12:29.980
was made 10 years too early.

12:29.980 --> 12:34.620
The past few years have seen a rise in comparisons between Idiocracy and the real world.

12:34.620 --> 12:39.580
In the respected Time Magazine, published an article titled, We Have Become an Idiocracy.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.540
The term has become so much more than just the title of a great movie.

12:42.540 --> 12:47.180
It's now used regularly when something moronic happens, and the press dubs it an Idiocracy

12:47.180 --> 12:48.660
moment.

12:48.660 --> 12:53.060
Three years after Idiocracy, Judge would return to directing with the comedy Extract, which

12:53.060 --> 12:56.860
he financed independently after learning his lessons dealing with studios.

12:56.860 --> 13:01.460
Otherwise, he's been busy, with the short-lived animated show The Good Family, creating the

13:01.460 --> 13:08.220
hit HBO series Silicon Valley, and more adolescent debauchery with new Beavis and Butthead material.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.760
Mike Judge has said that with Office Space, it was such a sweet success when it found

13:11.760 --> 13:16.580
an audience after the fact, but with Idiocracy, he doesn't feel that same sense of pride,

13:16.580 --> 13:20.980
because that film's success has come at the expense of the dumbing down of America.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.880
After all, he never dreamed he was making a documentary.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.100
And yet, here we are.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.100
Thank you for watching.
