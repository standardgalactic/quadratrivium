0	3040	What would you say is the best sci-fi movie ever made?
3040	8880	The Empire Strikes Back, Laid Runner, 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, Star Trek Wrath of
8880	13680	Khan, Matrix, Total Recall, or even the Adventures of Pluto Nash?
18240	22640	Well, those are all well and good, and some of the best genre-defining films, obviously
22640	23640	not Pluto Nash.
23640	27960	But what if I told you there was a movie that defied the genre in every way?
27960	31460	One that has stood the test of time and transcended the genre.
31460	36960	The film I'm talking about is Luc Besson's 1997 classic, The Fifth Element.
36960	42000	So let's hail a cab, win a contest to Floss in Paradise, and save the universe as we find
42000	44600	out what the f**k happened to this movie.
49000	52280	Luc Besson conceived the concept when he was just a teenager.
52280	57400	He was inspired by French science fiction comics, particularly Valerian and Loreline.
57400	59560	A project he would tackle later on.
59560	61280	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
61280	65680	While writing, he envisioned that the story would be set in the year 2300, and would be
65680	71080	about a nobody who wins a trip to the Club Med Resort on Floss in Paradise in the Angel
71080	72200	Constellation.
72200	77960	This nobody then meets Leeloo, who had the beauty of youth despite being over 2000 years
77960	78960	old.
78960	84080	During the 1980s, he would develop the script even more, and in 1991, he had put together
84080	85720	a 400-page script.
85720	90240	He also was honing his crafts, creating a documentary film entitled Atlantis, which
90240	93120	is a film all about the nature and beauty of the ocean.
93120	99200	Luc met with Patrice Leidu and Nicolas Seidu from Gouement, a French film company, to discuss
99200	101000	production for The Fifth Element.
101000	106440	He even sought after French comic creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mezier for the
106440	107980	film's production design.
107980	112040	Their comics were the inspiration that he would need for his overall design for the
112040	113440	sci-fi opus.
113440	118640	Mezier would design a Valerian comic entitled The Circles of Power, which had a character
118640	123800	who drives a flying taxi cab around a congested metropolis on an alien planet.
123800	128840	Luc was shown this and then fleshed out the concept for Corbin Dallas and his background.
128840	131560	You have five points left on your license.
131560	132560	Yes, thank you.
132560	135080	It's very minding.
135080	139840	Besson would hire five other artists for the project, including Jean-Paul Gaultier
139840	141120	for costume design.
141120	145560	Luc Besson approached Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson for the role of Corbin Dallas.
145560	149960	Willis expressed some interest, but was reluctant to take on the part because of his two previous
149960	153360	flops Hudson Hawk and Billy Bathgate.

200120	204640	friends a 13-year-old girl after her family is murdered by corrupt officers.
204640	208560	The film stars Jean Reneau, Natalie Portman, and Gary Oldman.
208560	213240	Some even say, myself included, that it's Gary Oldman's best role, and would cement
213240	222600	him as one of the best actors of all time.
222600	228000	The film would gross over $45 million worldwide on a $16 million budget.
228000	232000	During this successful time, Luke kept working on the script for the fifth element and not
232000	233720	wanting to give up on his vision.
233720	238040	He would reduce the film's budget to $90 million and went to Columbia Pictures, who
238040	239880	had a hand in financing Leon.
239880	241720	They would agree to finance the film.
241720	246240	Luke Basson was going to go for a lesser-known actor to play the role of Corbyn Dallas.
246240	251080	One day, Basson was in Barry Josephson's office and was talking to Bruce Willis regarding
251080	253080	another film that he was set to star in.
253080	257360	Basson asked to speak to Willis to just say, hello, and said that the fifth element was
257360	260000	moving forward with a less expensive actor.
260000	264600	Bruce said, quote, if I like the film, we can always come to an arrangement, end quote.
264600	274800	Willis would then read the script and accept the role.
274800	277800	Production for the fifth element would begin in August 1995.
277800	282720	Basson and crew traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London, and
282720	283720	Rome.
283720	288880	London would be hired as Jean-Baptiste Zorg, the head of a major corporation and supplier
288880	296440	of various weapons and devices.
296440	302240	Chris Tucker, Ian Holm, Luke Perry, Brian James, Tommy, Tiny Lister Jr., and Tricky
302240	313560	for massive attack were also cast in the film.
313560	320240	When it came time to hire Lilu, Basson would pick Mila Jovovich after seeing 200-300 applicants
320240	321240	in person.
321240	325880	Basson would go on to create a fake language entitled the Divine Language that Mila had
325880	326880	to learn.
326880	330480	The two would then have conversations and write letters to each other in this language
330480	333640	to help her better understand the role that she was taking on.
333640	337640	Chris Tucker's character, Ruby Rod, was originally given to Prince.
337640	341400	Unfortunately, Prince couldn't take on the part because he couldn't schedule filming
341400	342880	around his touring dates.
342880	346800	Both Chris Tucker and Jamie Foxx were each considered for the role, but Basson felt
346800	350280	that Tucker's smaller body suited the character much better.
350280	354720	Even though I'm looking at this through biased eyes, I can't see anyone else as Ruby Rod
354720	370200	or would even give the same energetically manic performance the way Chris does.
370200	374600	As a lover of his homeland, Basson wanted to film the massive production in France.
374600	378880	Unfortunately, he couldn't find any suitable facilities, so he would move the production
378880	379880	to London.
379880	384200	Filming would take place at Pinewood Studios on seven sound stages.
384200	387160	Construction for these sets began in October 1995.
387160	391960	The opening and closing scenes that were depicting Egypt were filmed in Mauritania, and Plava
391960	396000	Laguna's opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House in London.
396000	400720	Filming with actors began in January 1996 and was completed five months later.
400720	408880	When Bruce Willis finished filming around May, Gary Oldman's scenes would begin.
408880	413760	The designs of the New York City skyscrapers came from 1960s apartment designs as well
413760	419120	as futuristic designs from architect Antonio Santalia in the 1910s.
419120	423920	Basson demanded that most action would take place in daylight and wanted a brighter, cheerfully
424000	427280	crazy look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one.
427280	428560	On to the costume design.
428560	434640	Gaultier would design each of the 900 costumes that were worn by extras on the Flosten Paradise
434640	435640	ship.
435640	439680	These designs were described as intellectually transgressive and were said to challenge sexuality
439680	440880	and gender norms.
440880	446720	Mila's costume for Lilu, when she first survived, was inspired by hospital dressing and bandages
446720	451160	that provided minimal modesty, but today are considered to be some people's favorite
451160	452800	costumes for conventions.
453200	456480	I know, I could take a few pictures.
458240	459360	The archives.
459360	462800	There were three different teams who would handle three different types of effects on
462800	463680	the fifth element.
463680	466960	Nick Adler would direct mechanical and pyrotechnical effects.
466960	471360	Nick Dudman was placed in charge of creature effects and Mark Stetson was in charge of
471360	472560	the visual effects team.
472560	477040	Digital domain would be hired for the visual effects and several different software was
477040	480240	used to achieve the 90s visuals we've come to love today.
480240	485360	Some shots in the film used a combination of live action, scale models, CGI, and particle
485360	486000	systems.
486000	488560	This is all present throughout the New York City scenes.
488560	493280	And even though the movie came out in 1997, all of these visual effects still hold up
493280	495040	incredibly well to this day.
495040	499360	Fun fact, all of the stars in the background were created by poking holes in the sheet of
499360	500320	black fabric.
500320	504160	My favorite bit of history involving the production of this movie revolves around the
504160	505520	New York City buildings.
505520	508400	The production team would create scale models for the city.
508480	514320	Apartment blocks and skyscrapers were constructed to be 20 feet high in a one 24th scale.
514320	518720	It took a team of 80 workers five months to build all the models.
518720	522960	The windows of the buildings were cited by the team as one of the most time consuming
522960	528480	tasks, along with details behind the windows, including furniture, blinds, and tiny pieces
528480	529600	of flat artwork.
529600	534160	Of course, virtual sets were built within digital environments to enhance the miniatures
534160	536240	and make everything seem all that more real.
536400	546240	Because this film takes place in the 23rd century, there would need to be a different
546240	547440	form of transportation.
547440	551040	Flying cars, boats, and ships were constructed for the movie.
551040	554640	Physical models were created, though, to serve as practical references.
554640	558880	Majority of the scenes that these vehicles were in, particularly the car chase,
558880	560400	relied on visual effects.
560400	565360	Mark Stetson utilized a combination of CGI and practical elements so the cars would
565440	568880	look photorealistic in camera with the busy metropolis.
568880	573040	Blue and green screen technology was used for this as well and allowed the actors to
573040	574880	react and interact within the vehicles.
589840	593680	Now let's discuss the soundtrack and what a dose of nostalgia it is.
593680	598400	The score was composed by Luc Besson's longtime collaborator, Eric Serra, and is
598400	600640	considered intrinsically musical.
600640	606000	Serra relied heavily on the use of orchestral texture and used many exotic influences.
606000	610960	This can be seen in such scenes as the Stalinist fanfare heard before the spaceport,
613040	615440	reggae music playing in preparation for the flight,
618960	623280	and a hula music that is played when the passengers arrive on the flossing paradise ship.
624480	633920	He would even recruit Peter Gabriel to record the song's track, Little Light of Love.
633920	638000	The most influential and memorable song from the film is the diva dance.
638000	642880	It takes place on the flossing ship when a blue-skinned alien opera singer is performing.
642880	646800	It combines operatic singing with electronic futuristic elements.
646800	650640	Serra showed soprano Inva Mula, who dubs the voice of the diva.
650640	655200	She would tell him that some notes were not humanly possible to achieve because the human
655200	657120	voice can't change notes that fast.
657120	661520	She would perform the notes in isolation as opposed to singing all the notes together.
661520	664080	These notes were then digitized to fit the music.
664080	668240	During this scene, we see Corbin Dallas gaze and awe at her performance.
668240	673200	It's all real because that was the first time Bruce had heard it and seen the actress in full makeup.
673840	681600	The fifth element would make its first premiere on May 7, 1997,
681600	684240	as the opening film for the Cannes Film Festival.
684240	689760	Gaumont built an area for screening and included a fashion show designed by Gaultier himself,
689760	692480	as well as fireworks and a futuristic ballet.
692480	696000	The film would open domestically on May 9, 1997,
696000	700240	coming in first place, earning $17 million on its opening weekend.
700240	702800	It would go on to become a box office success,
702800	706240	grossing over $263 million worldwide.
706240	710400	75% of its receipts were from markets outside the US.
710400	715200	It would become the most successful film of the French box office in 1997
715200	720080	and would hold the record of the highest grossing French film at the foreign box office
720080	724640	for 16 years until In Touchables was released in 2011.
724640	727680	It currently holds a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes,
727680	730960	with critics at the time saying it's warm, fun,
730960	735440	and boast some of the most sophisticated production and costume design you've ever seen,
735440	738320	while being a campy sci-fi extravaganza.
740080	745040	Alejandro Jodorowsky and Jean Girard sued Besson after the film was released,
745040	748400	claiming that the fifth element had plagiarized their comic, The In Call.
748400	752880	Girard sued for 13.1 million euros for unfair competition,
752960	755280	9 million euros in damages and interest,
755280	758720	and 2-5% of the net operating revenues of the film.
758720	761840	Jodorowsky sued for 700,000 euros.
761840	764160	The case would be dismissed in 2004,
764160	767120	on the grounds that only tiny fragments of the comic were used
767120	772000	and that Jean had been hired by Besson to work on the film before the allegations were made.
772720	785200	The fifth element originally released on home video in America,
785200	789760	on December 10, 1997, to VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD.
789760	793680	In 2001, Sony would release the film on its Superbit DVD,
793680	798960	with superior-sounding picture quality compared to its less-than-stellar original DVD release.
798960	802320	If you were to walk into any Bose store in the early 2000s,
802320	806400	this movie would always be on display when purchasing a surround sound system
806400	807600	for your home entertainment.
807600	811920	For super fans like myself, we awaited the day that Sony would release a DVD
811920	814320	with extras containing the making of the film.
814320	818160	On January 11, 2005, that wait would finally be over.
828960	850400	On June 20, 2006, Sony would then release the first Blu-ray edition of the movie
850400	854880	and would be criticized as having poor picture quality and lack of any features.
854880	858480	Sony would actually respond to the complaints and in a rare move,
858480	862560	remastered the Blu-ray release on July 17, 2007.
862560	866160	They even offered a replacement exchange program for customers who were
866160	868080	unhappy with the original Blu-ray.
868080	871520	Since then, Sony has released a DigiBook Blu-ray of the movie
871520	877200	and a 20th anniversary 4K remaster, which has the best picture quality you could see for the film.
885280	890640	This film would be nominated for Best Sound Editing at the 70th Academy Awards,
890640	892560	but would ultimately lose to Titanic.
892560	896800	However, it would win the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects,
896800	900400	and Luc Besson would take on the Lumiere's Award for Best Director.
900400	905520	Thierry Obogost, the cinematographer on the film, was awarded the Technical Grand Prize
905520	910800	at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this film and She's So Lovely.
910800	915440	It would also receive four Saturn Award nominations for Best Science Fiction Film,
915440	918960	Best Costume, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actress.
926800	932320	There was even a movie tie-in game by Activision that was released in 1998 for the PlayStation 1
932320	938240	console and PC. The PS1 game is considered to be one of the worst movie tie-in games of all time,
938240	942720	whereas the PC version was better received. I have played the PlayStation 1 version,
942720	947760	and can say that it's incredibly frustrating and some of the worst controls I've ever played on
947760	954480	a console. In 2001, New York Race was released on the PlayStation 2, Game Boy Color, and PC.
954480	959040	It was a racing game based on the film and released exclusively in Europe. However,
959040	963600	if you look around eBay or Mercari, you're bound to find a decent copy if you're into
963600	975200	nostalgia video games. Since its initial release, the film has been considered a sci-fi cult classic.
975200	980000	Bruce Willis would even go on to say, quote, it was a real fun movie to make, end quote,
980000	985440	and Mila Jovovich described working with Besson as, quote, the first really amazing director I
985440	990560	had worked with, end quote. While many people will compare it to Star Wars, which is incredible,
990560	995040	and I have loved those movies for as long as I can remember, they aren't as special to me
995040	999520	as the Fifth Element. I'm sure people watching this are thinking, you're crazy, and that's
999520	1005760	totally fine. As a 90s kid, my idol was Bruce Willis. From Die Hard 3, 12 Monkeys, Hudson
1005760	1011040	Hawk, and The Last Boy Scout, he was a staple of my childhood. His performance, as well as the
1011040	1014800	eye-opening scenes, have stayed lodged in the front of my brain forever.
1028720	1033760	In conclusion, the Fifth Element is a visually inventive and entertaining film that has become
1033760	1039280	a cult classic. It boasts a distinctive style, eclectic characters, and imaginative world,
1039280	1044880	which all add up to what some would say, including myself, is the staple of sci-fi action films.
1044880	1050080	Whether you like it or not, it's a film that offers both a fun and memorable cinematic experience.
1069280	1082080	Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.
1099280	1100660	you
