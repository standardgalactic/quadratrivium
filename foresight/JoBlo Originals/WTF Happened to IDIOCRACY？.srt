1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
I want you to hit me as hard as you can."

2
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:11,540
In the year 2006, Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest, reigned supreme at the

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:16,700
box office, while the Boston crime saga, The Departed, led to the first and only Oscar

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,860
for director Martin Scorsese.

5
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:23,380
But in the 15 years since then, one other film has also become a cultural milestone

6
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,300
due to its weirdly prescient views of the future.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,100
A film so neglected in its initial release that the studio didn't even bother to make

8
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,460
a trailer for it.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,780
Dubbed the smartest stupid movie ever made, Idiocracy was barely a box office blip when

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,900
it was quietly released in September 2006.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,460
Why was this film from renowned creator Mike Judge tossed aside and left to die by the

12
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,700
studio?

13
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:55,380
Mutilate your thirst as we find out what the f*** happened to this movie.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:58,420
Mike Judge is no prophet, just an average guy.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,260
Born in Ecuador and raised in New Mexico, Judge would later graduate from University

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,420
of California, San Diego, with a degree in physics.

17
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,300
But after working several menial jobs in his chosen field, he found himself getting bored,

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,780
so he did what every person does when they don't like physics anymore, become a bass

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,220
player for the Shamu Band at SeaWorld in San Diego, and follow that by touring with

20
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:22,340
blues musicians Anson Funderberg and Doyle Bramhall.

21
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,180
At this point, Judge had also started messing around with animation, even purchasing a 16mm

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,940
camera to make his own animated shorts.

23
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,340
This led to the creation of Frog Baseball, based on a conversation he once overheard

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,140
where two people actually discussed such a thing.

25
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,620
Judge thought to himself, who the hell would do that?

26
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,680
How about Beavis and Butthead?

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,980
This short, which aired as part of the MTV series Liquid Television, was so popular that

28
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,860
it led to MTV signing Judge to create the now iconic series Beavis and Butthead.

29
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:55,820
The show aired nearly 200 episodes in the span of just 5 years, with many critics accusing

30
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:02,540
the show of being responsible for the dumbing down of America.

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,260
That controversy didn't matter, as Beavis and Butthead has become one of television's

32
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:12,300
longest lasting properties, with a successful theatrical film in 1996, a new season in 2011,

33
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,260
and more soon to come.

34
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,580
Judge would make the leap to live action with Office Space, based on his animated Milton

35
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,580
shorts, another case of the creator taking inspiration from real life.

36
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,500
The character was based on an actual man he had worked with in his engineering days.

37
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,940
Judge noticed that no one would ever talk to the man, so one day he stopped and said

38
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,020
hi, and that simple gesture gave the man the audience he had been waiting for to unload

39
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,780
all of his frustrations, including a threat to burn the building down if they moved his

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,340
desk again.

41
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,980
Even though we now think of Office Space as a modern classic, it was actually a blink

42
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,660
and you'll miss it affair.

43
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:48,380
Even before its release, the studio showed very little faith in the film, telling Judge

44
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,140
he needed to amp up the energy and get rid of the gangster rap.

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,740
Leading up to its release in February 1999, the marketing left a lot to be desired, with

46
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,920
Judge and several cast members absolutely hating the theatrical poster of a man covered

47
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,620
in Post-it notes, making it look more like an ad for Big Bird or Office Depot, not a

48
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,180
comedy film.

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,300
Office Space would only make $10 million in theaters.

50
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:14,940
One studio head reportedly told Judge, nobody wants to see your little movie about ordinary

51
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,520
people and their boring little lives.

52
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,120
Even though Office Space crashed and burned theatrically, it quickly gained a following

53
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,440
on home video, particularly with viewers who could sympathize with its eerily accurate

54
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,400
depiction of 9-to-5 cubicle life.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,520
Because of that eventual success, 20th Century Fox was anticipating Judge's next project.

56
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,960
It took a few years, but eventually Judge pitched his idea for idiocracy.

57
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,240
The concept of a society that gradually gets dumber is actually not a new one, previously

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,800
explored in stories like Cyril M. Cornbluth's 1951 short The Marching Morons.

59
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:52,400
But Judge credited his inspiration for the idea to a trip he once had taken to Disneyland.

60
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,720
While he and his daughter stood in line waiting for a ride, two nearby women, each with children

61
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,840
and strollers, began arguing loudly and screaming profanities.

62
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,360
This prompted Judge to think, is this the future Walt Disney had envisioned for his

63
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
theme park?

64
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,200
He also thought about the movie 2001 A Space Odyssey, contemplating a different futuristic

65
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,440
setting where instead of the monolith and everything being pristine and advanced, what

66
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,720
if it was the Jerry Springer show and giant Walmarts?

67
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,120
When Judge sat down to write the script, which was then titled The United States of America,

68
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,000
he used his own school experience as a guideline.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,760
When a teacher would be disappointed in the class's test scores and point out that Judge

70
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,960
was the only student who did well, the other school kids would be furious and say, we are

71
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,320
going to beat the shit out of you after class.

72
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,880
So when writing the movie, he essentially imagined his junior high class taking over

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,320
the world.

74
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,760
Once the production got rolling, the film's cast came together quickly with Luke Wilson

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,840
as ordinary guy Joe Bowers, later known as Not Sure, a remarkably unremarkable army librarian

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,120
selected for a suspended animation experiment that goes wrong.

77
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,360
He's joined by SNL regular Maya Rudolph as prostitute and future First Lady Rita, Dax

78
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,400
Shepard as avid TV watcher and lawyer Frito Pendejo, and Terry Crews as President Dwayne

79
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,440
Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho, a role he auditioned for several times, even telling

80
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,600
the casting director, if you can find anyone better than me for this role, cast him immediately.

81
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,000
The movie, tentatively retitled 3001, filmed around Texas in 2004.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
According to the cast and crew, it was a relatively straightforward and fun shoot, but behind

83
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,680
the scenes, Judge was dealing with headache after headache from the studio.

84
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,340
The budget was only a few million dollars, but they were nickel and diming him, refusing

85
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,880
to pay for several visual effects shots.

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,000
This resulted in Judge asking his friend, Robert Rodriguez, to do some of the shots,

87
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,160
which the filmmaker kindly supplied free of charge.

88
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,280
Another hassle Judge experienced was making sure his futuristic movie actually seemed

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:49,800
like it was set in the future, which meant choosing wardrobe that could be plausible

90
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,720
500 years from now.

91
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,120
One day, the production's costume designer brought in some clunky footwear that was

92
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,520
made of plastic.

93
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,000
Judge thought, look at these stupid plastic shoes, you'd have to be an idiot to wear

94
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
them.

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,260
He was wary of using them in the film out of concern they could actually become popular

96
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,780
by the time it was released, but he was assured that could never happen.

97
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,940
Cut to two years later and crocs were everywhere.

98
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,940
Another time Judge wasn't far off from reality was when he shot two minutes of just a bare

99
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,660
butt for the movie within a movie titled simply, Ass.

100
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,260
The crew went to a reform school and used 250 students for a scene where a packed movie

101
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,020
theater audience can't stop laughing at this quote-unquote film.

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:30,660
Judge assumed he would have to direct the crowd, since a movie featuring just a flatulent

103
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,580
butt surely wouldn't make any sense without context.

104
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,300
To his surprise and dismay, the audience all started laughing without direction and couldn't

105
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
stop.

106
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,260
Judge turned to his director of photography and pondered why they were even bothering

107
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,340
to make idiocracy when they could just release this.

108
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,580
But the film's true challenges came after production wrapped.

109
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,260
Test screenings began in March 2005, yielding some pretty terrible results.

110
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,500
The cast and crew reconvened for reshoots to address some of the problems, and the second

111
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,860
round of test screenings garnered much higher results.

112
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,980
Judge in the studio butted heads over how to market the movie.

113
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,420
Judge felt burned by how Fox mishandled Office Space and didn't want the same fate for idiocracy.

114
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,220
He said the studio was treating it like some kind of deep, what-if-time-travel-was-real

115
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,780
movie, and not what he said it actually was, the story of an average guy who winds up in

116
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,940
a stupid future.

117
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,060
With Office Space a newly minted cult hit and Beavis and Butthead still popular, you

118
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,980
might think Fox would have launched a heavy marketing campaign to let the world know something

119
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,900
new was coming from Mike Judge.

120
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,380
And yet, for months, silence.

121
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:36,940
Idiocracy sat on the shelf for over a year, and no one involved with the film knew what

122
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,300
was going on.

123
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:42,340
Judge speculated that with Office Space, the studio spent millions on advertising, only

124
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,500
for the film to fail theatrically but become a hit-on-home video, and perhaps the studio

125
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,860
was thinking the same thing would happen with idiocracy, so why spend money to promote

126
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:50,860
it?

127
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:54,060
Others claim that Fox was simply disappointed because they were under the impression that

128
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:58,180
idiocracy was going to be dumb yet funny, like Beavis and Butthead, and instead what

129
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,420
they got was a funny movie that makes fun of the dumb.

130
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,220
But the consensus seems to be that Fox got cold feet when the companies that had allowed

131
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:12,060
their brands to be used in the movie got wind that their brands were actually being mocked.

132
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,700
While making the film, the studio's lawyers actually told Judge to make fun of several

133
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,580
big name brands as a way to get them all to agree, as opposed to only choosing one or

134
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,500
two and having them feel like they were being singled out.

135
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,380
This led to the creation of the Red Light District scene.

136
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,420
Allegedly, prior to the movie's release, several of these companies complained to Fox about

137
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,660
their depictions, and not wanting to hurt potential future sponsorships, the studio

138
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,060
agreed to bury the movie.

139
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:39,820
Just months before the film's release, Judge was interviewed by Esquire magazine about

140
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,820
his career.

141
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,300
During the interview, Judge was waiting for Fox to call and allow him to show the reporter

142
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,140
the trailer for Idiocracy.

143
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,220
The call from the studio never came.

144
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,180
In fact, no theatrical trailer was released prior to the film hitting theaters.

145
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,580
No press screenings were given to reviewers.

146
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,660
There were no ads of any kind, say for a single theatrical poster, something a former

147
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,340
marketing head at Fox said he had never seen before.

148
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,540
Idiocracy was released on only 130 screens in September 2006, with many accusing the

149
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:12,380
studio of giving it a theatrical release purely to fulfill a contractual obligation.

150
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,980
Fox even went so far as to label the movie Untitled Mike Judge Comedy on popular ticketing

151
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,140
sites like Moviefone and Fandango, creating confusion for people that may have actually

152
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,100
been looking for Idiocracy.

153
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,580
With all of that working against it, it's no wonder the film only managed to take in

154
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,060
less than half a million dollars in its entire theatrical run.

155
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,100
The movie that the studio clearly wanted to fail did just that.

156
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,780
But then something happened.

157
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,700
Critics who were denied an early screening finally saw the film and began praising it,

158
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,820
hailing it as the most potent political film of the year.

159
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,860
Variety critic Robert Kohler called it daring, saying it was one of the few films with any

160
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,140
ideas.

161
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,820
With the movie getting a quick turnaround to home video, people were finally able to see

162
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:57,780
Idiocracy and see what they did as it amassed over 9 million dollars in home video rentals.

163
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:01,980
For most movies, that would be where the story ends, but for Idiocracy, that's only part

164
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,060
of the story.

165
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,780
When Judge sat down to write this movie, he exaggerated to such extremes that he never

166
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,060
thought they would actually come true, at least in his lifetime.

167
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:14,140
When asked about this in a recent interview, he commented, I'm no profit, I was off by

168
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,780
about 490 years.

169
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,700
There have been countless videos made comparing a certain political leader's speeches to

170
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,780
those by President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho.

171
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,740
Fox even shut down the possibility of Terry Crews reprising his role as President Dwayne

172
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:35,260
Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho for a series of fake campaign ads before the 2016

173
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,460
US election.

174
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,300
The studio feared the comedic videos would be viewed by some as attack ads.

175
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Even the movie's jokes that seemed outrageous, like the Secretary of State being sponsored

176
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,300
by Carl's Jr.

177
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:54,620
Practically became prophecy when the actual CEO of Carl's Jr. was nominated to become

178
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,300
the United States Secretary of Labor.

179
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,980
But it's not just political aspects that have made Idiocracy so relevant.

180
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:05,660
Its depiction of a society reliant on pictures for communication mimics the growing obsession

181
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,220
with emojis.

182
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,420
The film shows a world where curse words are no longer taboo, but used as powerful marketing

183
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,020
tools, which seems familiar.

184
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,260
Much like the movie's omnipresent fluid, Brando, we would actually come to see COVID

185
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,060
testing sites shamelessly sponsored by big-name stores and drink companies.

186
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,940
Even a show like Ow My Balls, or a clash between phallic monster trucks, don't seem like they

187
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:33,060
would be that out of place on one of today's countless cable channels and streaming services.

188
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:38,100
Corporate mega-mergers, like the movies AT&T, Time Warner, Taco Bell, have practically become

189
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,100
reality.

190
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:44,300
So further than Disney's acquisitions of giant brands like Pixar, Lucasfilm, Marvel, and

191
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,180
Idiocracy's owner, 20th Century Fox.

192
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:52,060
Perhaps most outlandish of all was the movie's concept of coffee shops that also offered sexual

193
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,060
favors.

194
00:11:53,060 --> 00:12:01,540
Who would imagine that would become a real thing?

195
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:05,820
And yet there's the real-life Falatio Cafe, located in Geneva, Switzerland.

196
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,620
Sure, it's not Starbucks, but are we really that far off?

197
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,540
In 2017, Mike Judge was being interviewed on the Sony lot by The New York Times.

198
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,700
Tom Rothman, head of Fox at the time of Idiocracy's release, interrupted them to admit that Idiocracy's

199
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,140
failure was entirely his fault, to which Judge quickly replied, I agree.

200
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:27,620
Rothman said that Judge and the film were ahead of their time, and perhaps the movie

201
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,980
was made 10 years too early.

202
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,620
The past few years have seen a rise in comparisons between Idiocracy and the real world.

203
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,580
In the respected Time Magazine, published an article titled, We Have Become an Idiocracy.

204
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,540
The term has become so much more than just the title of a great movie.

205
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,180
It's now used regularly when something moronic happens, and the press dubs it an Idiocracy

206
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,660
moment.

207
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,060
Three years after Idiocracy, Judge would return to directing with the comedy Extract, which

208
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,860
he financed independently after learning his lessons dealing with studios.

209
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:01,460
Otherwise, he's been busy, with the short-lived animated show The Good Family, creating the

210
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:08,220
hit HBO series Silicon Valley, and more adolescent debauchery with new Beavis and Butthead material.

211
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,760
Mike Judge has said that with Office Space, it was such a sweet success when it found

212
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,580
an audience after the fact, but with Idiocracy, he doesn't feel that same sense of pride,

213
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,980
because that film's success has come at the expense of the dumbing down of America.

214
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,880
After all, he never dreamed he was making a documentary.

215
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,100
And yet, here we are.

216
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Thank you for watching.
