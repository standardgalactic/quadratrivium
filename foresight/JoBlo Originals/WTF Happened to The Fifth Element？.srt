1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
What would you say is the best sci-fi movie ever made?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,880
The Empire Strikes Back, Laid Runner, 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, Star Trek Wrath of

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,680
Khan, Matrix, Total Recall, or even the Adventures of Pluto Nash?

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,640
Well, those are all well and good, and some of the best genre-defining films, obviously

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,640
not Pluto Nash.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,960
But what if I told you there was a movie that defied the genre in every way?

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,460
One that has stood the test of time and transcended the genre.

8
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,960
The film I'm talking about is Luc Besson's 1997 classic, The Fifth Element.

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,000
So let's hail a cab, win a contest to Floss in Paradise, and save the universe as we find

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,600
out what the f**k happened to this movie.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,280
Luc Besson conceived the concept when he was just a teenager.

12
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,400
He was inspired by French science fiction comics, particularly Valerian and Loreline.

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,560
A project he would tackle later on.

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,280
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,680
While writing, he envisioned that the story would be set in the year 2300, and would be

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,080
about a nobody who wins a trip to the Club Med Resort on Floss in Paradise in the Angel

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,200
Constellation.

18
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,960
This nobody then meets Leeloo, who had the beauty of youth despite being over 2000 years

19
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,960
old.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,080
During the 1980s, he would develop the script even more, and in 1991, he had put together

21
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,720
a 400-page script.

22
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,240
He also was honing his crafts, creating a documentary film entitled Atlantis, which

23
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,120
is a film all about the nature and beauty of the ocean.

24
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,200
Luc met with Patrice Leidu and Nicolas Seidu from Gouement, a French film company, to discuss

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,000
production for The Fifth Element.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:46,440
He even sought after French comic creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mezier for the

27
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,980
film's production design.

28
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:52,040
Their comics were the inspiration that he would need for his overall design for the

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,440
sci-fi opus.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,640
Mezier would design a Valerian comic entitled The Circles of Power, which had a character

31
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,800
who drives a flying taxi cab around a congested metropolis on an alien planet.

32
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,840
Luc was shown this and then fleshed out the concept for Corbin Dallas and his background.

33
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,560
You have five points left on your license.

34
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,560
Yes, thank you.

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,080
It's very minding.

36
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Besson would hire five other artists for the project, including Jean-Paul Gaultier

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
for costume design.

38
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,560
Luc Besson approached Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson for the role of Corbin Dallas.

39
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,960
Willis expressed some interest, but was reluctant to take on the part because of his two previous

40
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,360
flops Hudson Hawk and Billy Bathgate.

41
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,360
Bunny.

42
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
Boop.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
Boop.

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Boop.

45
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Boop.

46
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Boop.

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360

64
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,520

65
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Boop.

66
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Boop.

67
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,520
Boop.

68
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,520
Boop.

69
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Boop.

70
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Boop.

71
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Boop.

72
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
Boop.

73
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Boop.

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Boop.

75
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Boop.

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Boop.

77
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Boop.

78
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Boop.

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
no Boop.

80
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Boop.

81
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Boop.

82
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Boop.

83
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,120
Boop.

84
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,640
friends a 13-year-old girl after her family is murdered by corrupt officers.

85
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,560
The film stars Jean Reneau, Natalie Portman, and Gary Oldman.

86
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,240
Some even say, myself included, that it's Gary Oldman's best role, and would cement

87
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:42,600
him as one of the best actors of all time.

88
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,000
The film would gross over $45 million worldwide on a $16 million budget.

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
During this successful time, Luke kept working on the script for the fifth element and not

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
wanting to give up on his vision.

91
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,040
He would reduce the film's budget to $90 million and went to Columbia Pictures, who

92
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,880
had a hand in financing Leon.

93
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,720
They would agree to finance the film.

94
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,240
Luke Basson was going to go for a lesser-known actor to play the role of Corbyn Dallas.

95
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,080
One day, Basson was in Barry Josephson's office and was talking to Bruce Willis regarding

96
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
another film that he was set to star in.

97
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,360
Basson asked to speak to Willis to just say, hello, and said that the fifth element was

98
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,000
moving forward with a less expensive actor.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Bruce said, quote, if I like the film, we can always come to an arrangement, end quote.

100
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:34,800
Willis would then read the script and accept the role.

101
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Production for the fifth element would begin in August 1995.

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,720
Basson and crew traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London, and

103
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
Rome.

104
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,880
London would be hired as Jean-Baptiste Zorg, the head of a major corporation and supplier

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:56,440
of various weapons and devices.

106
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,240
Chris Tucker, Ian Holm, Luke Perry, Brian James, Tommy, Tiny Lister Jr., and Tricky

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:13,560
for massive attack were also cast in the film.

108
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,240
When it came time to hire Lilu, Basson would pick Mila Jovovich after seeing 200-300 applicants

109
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
in person.

110
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,880
Basson would go on to create a fake language entitled the Divine Language that Mila had

111
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,880
to learn.

112
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,480
The two would then have conversations and write letters to each other in this language

113
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,640
to help her better understand the role that she was taking on.

114
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,640
Chris Tucker's character, Ruby Rod, was originally given to Prince.

115
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,400
Unfortunately, Prince couldn't take on the part because he couldn't schedule filming

116
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,880
around his touring dates.

117
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
Both Chris Tucker and Jamie Foxx were each considered for the role, but Basson felt

118
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,280
that Tucker's smaller body suited the character much better.

119
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,720
Even though I'm looking at this through biased eyes, I can't see anyone else as Ruby Rod

120
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:10,200
or would even give the same energetically manic performance the way Chris does.

121
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,600
As a lover of his homeland, Basson wanted to film the massive production in France.

122
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,880
Unfortunately, he couldn't find any suitable facilities, so he would move the production

123
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,880
to London.

124
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,200
Filming would take place at Pinewood Studios on seven sound stages.

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Construction for these sets began in October 1995.

126
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,960
The opening and closing scenes that were depicting Egypt were filmed in Mauritania, and Plava

127
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,000
Laguna's opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House in London.

128
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,720
Filming with actors began in January 1996 and was completed five months later.

129
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:48,880
When Bruce Willis finished filming around May, Gary Oldman's scenes would begin.

130
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,760
The designs of the New York City skyscrapers came from 1960s apartment designs as well

131
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,120
as futuristic designs from architect Antonio Santalia in the 1910s.

132
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,920
Basson demanded that most action would take place in daylight and wanted a brighter, cheerfully

133
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,280
crazy look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one.

134
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
On to the costume design.

135
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,640
Gaultier would design each of the 900 costumes that were worn by extras on the Flosten Paradise

136
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
ship.

137
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,680
These designs were described as intellectually transgressive and were said to challenge sexuality

138
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
and gender norms.

139
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,720
Mila's costume for Lilu, when she first survived, was inspired by hospital dressing and bandages

140
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,160
that provided minimal modesty, but today are considered to be some people's favorite

141
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,800
costumes for conventions.

142
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,480
I know, I could take a few pictures.

143
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,360
The archives.

144
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
There were three different teams who would handle three different types of effects on

145
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,680
the fifth element.

146
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
Nick Adler would direct mechanical and pyrotechnical effects.

147
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,360
Nick Dudman was placed in charge of creature effects and Mark Stetson was in charge of

148
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,560
the visual effects team.

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,040
Digital domain would be hired for the visual effects and several different software was

150
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,240
used to achieve the 90s visuals we've come to love today.

151
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,360
Some shots in the film used a combination of live action, scale models, CGI, and particle

152
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,000
systems.

153
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,560
This is all present throughout the New York City scenes.

154
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,280
And even though the movie came out in 1997, all of these visual effects still hold up

155
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,040
incredibly well to this day.

156
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,360
Fun fact, all of the stars in the background were created by poking holes in the sheet of

157
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,320
black fabric.

158
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,160
My favorite bit of history involving the production of this movie revolves around the

159
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,520
New York City buildings.

160
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,400
The production team would create scale models for the city.

161
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:34,320
Apartment blocks and skyscrapers were constructed to be 20 feet high in a one 24th scale.

162
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,720
It took a team of 80 workers five months to build all the models.

163
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,960
The windows of the buildings were cited by the team as one of the most time consuming

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,480
tasks, along with details behind the windows, including furniture, blinds, and tiny pieces

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,600
of flat artwork.

166
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,160
Of course, virtual sets were built within digital environments to enhance the miniatures

167
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,240
and make everything seem all that more real.

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:06,240
Because this film takes place in the 23rd century, there would need to be a different

169
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
form of transportation.

170
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
Flying cars, boats, and ships were constructed for the movie.

171
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
Physical models were created, though, to serve as practical references.

172
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,880
Majority of the scenes that these vehicles were in, particularly the car chase,

173
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,400
relied on visual effects.

174
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,360
Mark Stetson utilized a combination of CGI and practical elements so the cars would

175
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,880
look photorealistic in camera with the busy metropolis.

176
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,040
Blue and green screen technology was used for this as well and allowed the actors to

177
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,880
react and interact within the vehicles.

178
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,680
Now let's discuss the soundtrack and what a dose of nostalgia it is.

179
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,400
The score was composed by Luc Besson's longtime collaborator, Eric Serra, and is

180
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,640
considered intrinsically musical.

181
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,000
Serra relied heavily on the use of orchestral texture and used many exotic influences.

182
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,960
This can be seen in such scenes as the Stalinist fanfare heard before the spaceport,

183
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,440
reggae music playing in preparation for the flight,

184
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:23,280
and a hula music that is played when the passengers arrive on the flossing paradise ship.

185
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:33,920
He would even recruit Peter Gabriel to record the song's track, Little Light of Love.

186
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,000
The most influential and memorable song from the film is the diva dance.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,880
It takes place on the flossing ship when a blue-skinned alien opera singer is performing.

188
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,800
It combines operatic singing with electronic futuristic elements.

189
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,640
Serra showed soprano Inva Mula, who dubs the voice of the diva.

190
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,200
She would tell him that some notes were not humanly possible to achieve because the human

191
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,120
voice can't change notes that fast.

192
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,520
She would perform the notes in isolation as opposed to singing all the notes together.

193
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,080
These notes were then digitized to fit the music.

194
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,240
During this scene, we see Corbin Dallas gaze and awe at her performance.

195
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,200
It's all real because that was the first time Bruce had heard it and seen the actress in full makeup.

196
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:21,600
The fifth element would make its first premiere on May 7, 1997,

197
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,240
as the opening film for the Cannes Film Festival.

198
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,760
Gaumont built an area for screening and included a fashion show designed by Gaultier himself,

199
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,480
as well as fireworks and a futuristic ballet.

200
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,000
The film would open domestically on May 9, 1997,

201
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
coming in first place, earning $17 million on its opening weekend.

202
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,800
It would go on to become a box office success,

203
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
grossing over $263 million worldwide.

204
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,400
75% of its receipts were from markets outside the US.

205
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,200
It would become the most successful film of the French box office in 1997

206
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,080
and would hold the record of the highest grossing French film at the foreign box office

207
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,640
for 16 years until In Touchables was released in 2011.

208
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,680
It currently holds a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes,

209
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,960
with critics at the time saying it's warm, fun,

210
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,440
and boast some of the most sophisticated production and costume design you've ever seen,

211
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,320
while being a campy sci-fi extravaganza.

212
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,040
Alejandro Jodorowsky and Jean Girard sued Besson after the film was released,

213
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,400
claiming that the fifth element had plagiarized their comic, The In Call.

214
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,880
Girard sued for 13.1 million euros for unfair competition,

215
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,280
9 million euros in damages and interest,

216
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,720
and 2-5% of the net operating revenues of the film.

217
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,840
Jodorowsky sued for 700,000 euros.

218
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,160
The case would be dismissed in 2004,

219
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,120
on the grounds that only tiny fragments of the comic were used

220
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,000
and that Jean had been hired by Besson to work on the film before the allegations were made.

221
00:12:52,720 --> 00:13:05,200
The fifth element originally released on home video in America,

222
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,760
on December 10, 1997, to VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD.

223
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,680
In 2001, Sony would release the film on its Superbit DVD,

224
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,960
with superior-sounding picture quality compared to its less-than-stellar original DVD release.

225
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,320
If you were to walk into any Bose store in the early 2000s,

226
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,400
this movie would always be on display when purchasing a surround sound system

227
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,600
for your home entertainment.

228
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
For super fans like myself, we awaited the day that Sony would release a DVD

229
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,320
with extras containing the making of the film.

230
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,160
On January 11, 2005, that wait would finally be over.

231
00:13:48,960 --> 00:14:10,400
On June 20, 2006, Sony would then release the first Blu-ray edition of the movie

232
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,880
and would be criticized as having poor picture quality and lack of any features.

233
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
Sony would actually respond to the complaints and in a rare move,

234
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,560
remastered the Blu-ray release on July 17, 2007.

235
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,160
They even offered a replacement exchange program for customers who were

236
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,080
unhappy with the original Blu-ray.

237
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,520
Since then, Sony has released a DigiBook Blu-ray of the movie

238
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,200
and a 20th anniversary 4K remaster, which has the best picture quality you could see for the film.

239
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,640
This film would be nominated for Best Sound Editing at the 70th Academy Awards,

240
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,560
but would ultimately lose to Titanic.

241
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,800
However, it would win the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects,

242
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,400
and Luc Besson would take on the Lumiere's Award for Best Director.

243
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,520
Thierry Obogost, the cinematographer on the film, was awarded the Technical Grand Prize

244
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:10,800
at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this film and She's So Lovely.

245
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,440
It would also receive four Saturn Award nominations for Best Science Fiction Film,

246
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,960
Best Costume, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actress.

247
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,320
There was even a movie tie-in game by Activision that was released in 1998 for the PlayStation 1

248
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,240
console and PC. The PS1 game is considered to be one of the worst movie tie-in games of all time,

249
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,720
whereas the PC version was better received. I have played the PlayStation 1 version,

250
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,760
and can say that it's incredibly frustrating and some of the worst controls I've ever played on

251
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,480
a console. In 2001, New York Race was released on the PlayStation 2, Game Boy Color, and PC.

252
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,040
It was a racing game based on the film and released exclusively in Europe. However,

253
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,600
if you look around eBay or Mercari, you're bound to find a decent copy if you're into

254
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:15,200
nostalgia video games. Since its initial release, the film has been considered a sci-fi cult classic.

255
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Bruce Willis would even go on to say, quote, it was a real fun movie to make, end quote,

256
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,440
and Mila Jovovich described working with Besson as, quote, the first really amazing director I

257
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,560
had worked with, end quote. While many people will compare it to Star Wars, which is incredible,

258
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,040
and I have loved those movies for as long as I can remember, they aren't as special to me

259
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,520
as the Fifth Element. I'm sure people watching this are thinking, you're crazy, and that's

260
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:45,760
totally fine. As a 90s kid, my idol was Bruce Willis. From Die Hard 3, 12 Monkeys, Hudson

261
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,040
Hawk, and The Last Boy Scout, he was a staple of my childhood. His performance, as well as the

262
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,800
eye-opening scenes, have stayed lodged in the front of my brain forever.

263
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,760
In conclusion, the Fifth Element is a visually inventive and entertaining film that has become

264
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,280
a cult classic. It boasts a distinctive style, eclectic characters, and imaginative world,

265
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,880
which all add up to what some would say, including myself, is the staple of sci-fi action films.

266
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,080
Whether you like it or not, it's a film that offers both a fun and memorable cinematic experience.

267
00:17:49,280 --> 00:18:02,080
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

268
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,660
you
