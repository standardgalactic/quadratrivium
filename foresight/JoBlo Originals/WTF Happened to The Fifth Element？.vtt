00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
What would you say is the best sci-fi movie ever made?

00:03.040 --> 00:08.880
The Empire Strikes Back, Laid Runner, 2001 Space Odyssey, Alien, Star Trek Wrath of

00:08.880 --> 00:13.680
Khan, Matrix, Total Recall, or even the Adventures of Pluto Nash?

00:18.240 --> 00:22.640
Well, those are all well and good, and some of the best genre-defining films, obviously

00:22.640 --> 00:23.640
not Pluto Nash.

00:23.640 --> 00:27.960
But what if I told you there was a movie that defied the genre in every way?

00:27.960 --> 00:31.460
One that has stood the test of time and transcended the genre.

00:31.460 --> 00:36.960
The film I'm talking about is Luc Besson's 1997 classic, The Fifth Element.

00:36.960 --> 00:42.000
So let's hail a cab, win a contest to Floss in Paradise, and save the universe as we find

00:42.000 --> 00:44.600
out what the f**k happened to this movie.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.280
Luc Besson conceived the concept when he was just a teenager.

00:52.280 --> 00:57.400
He was inspired by French science fiction comics, particularly Valerian and Loreline.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.560
A project he would tackle later on.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.280
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

01:01.280 --> 01:05.680
While writing, he envisioned that the story would be set in the year 2300, and would be

01:05.680 --> 01:11.080
about a nobody who wins a trip to the Club Med Resort on Floss in Paradise in the Angel

01:11.080 --> 01:12.200
Constellation.

01:12.200 --> 01:17.960
This nobody then meets Leeloo, who had the beauty of youth despite being over 2000 years

01:17.960 --> 01:18.960
old.

01:18.960 --> 01:24.080
During the 1980s, he would develop the script even more, and in 1991, he had put together

01:24.080 --> 01:25.720
a 400-page script.

01:25.720 --> 01:30.240
He also was honing his crafts, creating a documentary film entitled Atlantis, which

01:30.240 --> 01:33.120
is a film all about the nature and beauty of the ocean.

01:33.120 --> 01:39.200
Luc met with Patrice Leidu and Nicolas Seidu from Gouement, a French film company, to discuss

01:39.200 --> 01:41.000
production for The Fifth Element.

01:41.000 --> 01:46.440
He even sought after French comic creators Jean Giraud and Jean-Claude Mezier for the

01:46.440 --> 01:47.980
film's production design.

01:47.980 --> 01:52.040
Their comics were the inspiration that he would need for his overall design for the

01:52.040 --> 01:53.440
sci-fi opus.

01:53.440 --> 01:58.640
Mezier would design a Valerian comic entitled The Circles of Power, which had a character

01:58.640 --> 02:03.800
who drives a flying taxi cab around a congested metropolis on an alien planet.

02:03.800 --> 02:08.840
Luc was shown this and then fleshed out the concept for Corbin Dallas and his background.

02:08.840 --> 02:11.560
You have five points left on your license.

02:11.560 --> 02:12.560
Yes, thank you.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.080
It's very minding.

02:15.080 --> 02:19.840
Besson would hire five other artists for the project, including Jean-Paul Gaultier

02:19.840 --> 02:21.120
for costume design.

02:21.120 --> 02:25.560
Luc Besson approached Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson for the role of Corbin Dallas.

02:25.560 --> 02:29.960
Willis expressed some interest, but was reluctant to take on the part because of his two previous

02:29.960 --> 02:33.360
flops Hudson Hawk and Billy Bathgate.

02:33.360 --> 02:34.360
Bunny.

02:34.360 --> 02:35.360

02:35.360 --> 02:36.360

03:14.120 --> 03:15.120

03:15.120 --> 03:16.120

03:16.120 --> 03:17.120

03:17.120 --> 03:18.120

03:18.120 --> 03:19.120

03:19.120 --> 03:20.120
Boop.

03:20.120 --> 03:24.640
friends a 13-year-old girl after her family is murdered by corrupt officers.

03:24.640 --> 03:28.560
The film stars Jean Reneau, Natalie Portman, and Gary Oldman.

03:28.560 --> 03:33.240
Some even say, myself included, that it's Gary Oldman's best role, and would cement

03:33.240 --> 03:42.600
him as one of the best actors of all time.

03:42.600 --> 03:48.000
The film would gross over $45 million worldwide on a $16 million budget.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
During this successful time, Luke kept working on the script for the fifth element and not

03:52.000 --> 03:53.720
wanting to give up on his vision.

03:53.720 --> 03:58.040
He would reduce the film's budget to $90 million and went to Columbia Pictures, who

03:58.040 --> 03:59.880
had a hand in financing Leon.

03:59.880 --> 04:01.720
They would agree to finance the film.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.240
Luke Basson was going to go for a lesser-known actor to play the role of Corbyn Dallas.

04:06.240 --> 04:11.080
One day, Basson was in Barry Josephson's office and was talking to Bruce Willis regarding

04:11.080 --> 04:13.080
another film that he was set to star in.

04:13.080 --> 04:17.360
Basson asked to speak to Willis to just say, hello, and said that the fifth element was

04:17.360 --> 04:20.000
moving forward with a less expensive actor.

04:20.000 --> 04:24.600
Bruce said, quote, if I like the film, we can always come to an arrangement, end quote.

04:24.600 --> 04:34.800
Willis would then read the script and accept the role.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.800
Production for the fifth element would begin in August 1995.

04:37.800 --> 04:42.720
Basson and crew traveled to various places for casting, including Paris, London, and

04:42.720 --> 04:43.720
Rome.

04:43.720 --> 04:48.880
London would be hired as Jean-Baptiste Zorg, the head of a major corporation and supplier

04:48.880 --> 04:56.440
of various weapons and devices.

04:56.440 --> 05:02.240
Chris Tucker, Ian Holm, Luke Perry, Brian James, Tommy, Tiny Lister Jr., and Tricky

05:02.240 --> 05:13.560
for massive attack were also cast in the film.

05:13.560 --> 05:20.240
When it came time to hire Lilu, Basson would pick Mila Jovovich after seeing 200-300 applicants

05:20.240 --> 05:21.240
in person.

05:21.240 --> 05:25.880
Basson would go on to create a fake language entitled the Divine Language that Mila had

05:25.880 --> 05:26.880
to learn.

05:26.880 --> 05:30.480
The two would then have conversations and write letters to each other in this language

05:30.480 --> 05:33.640
to help her better understand the role that she was taking on.

05:33.640 --> 05:37.640
Chris Tucker's character, Ruby Rod, was originally given to Prince.

05:37.640 --> 05:41.400
Unfortunately, Prince couldn't take on the part because he couldn't schedule filming

05:41.400 --> 05:42.880
around his touring dates.

05:42.880 --> 05:46.800
Both Chris Tucker and Jamie Foxx were each considered for the role, but Basson felt

05:46.800 --> 05:50.280
that Tucker's smaller body suited the character much better.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.720
Even though I'm looking at this through biased eyes, I can't see anyone else as Ruby Rod

05:54.720 --> 06:10.200
or would even give the same energetically manic performance the way Chris does.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.600
As a lover of his homeland, Basson wanted to film the massive production in France.

06:14.600 --> 06:18.880
Unfortunately, he couldn't find any suitable facilities, so he would move the production

06:18.880 --> 06:19.880
to London.

06:19.880 --> 06:24.200
Filming would take place at Pinewood Studios on seven sound stages.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.160
Construction for these sets began in October 1995.

06:27.160 --> 06:31.960
The opening and closing scenes that were depicting Egypt were filmed in Mauritania, and Plava

06:31.960 --> 06:36.000
Laguna's opera scene was filmed at the Royal Opera House in London.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.720
Filming with actors began in January 1996 and was completed five months later.

06:40.720 --> 06:48.880
When Bruce Willis finished filming around May, Gary Oldman's scenes would begin.

06:48.880 --> 06:53.760
The designs of the New York City skyscrapers came from 1960s apartment designs as well

06:53.760 --> 06:59.120
as futuristic designs from architect Antonio Santalia in the 1910s.

06:59.120 --> 07:03.920
Basson demanded that most action would take place in daylight and wanted a brighter, cheerfully

07:04.000 --> 07:07.280
crazy look as opposed to a gloomy realistic one.

07:07.280 --> 07:08.560
On to the costume design.

07:08.560 --> 07:14.640
Gaultier would design each of the 900 costumes that were worn by extras on the Flosten Paradise

07:14.640 --> 07:15.640
ship.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.680
These designs were described as intellectually transgressive and were said to challenge sexuality

07:19.680 --> 07:20.880
and gender norms.

07:20.880 --> 07:26.720
Mila's costume for Lilu, when she first survived, was inspired by hospital dressing and bandages

07:26.720 --> 07:31.160
that provided minimal modesty, but today are considered to be some people's favorite

07:31.160 --> 07:32.800
costumes for conventions.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.480
I know, I could take a few pictures.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.360
The archives.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.800
There were three different teams who would handle three different types of effects on

07:42.800 --> 07:43.680
the fifth element.

07:43.680 --> 07:46.960
Nick Adler would direct mechanical and pyrotechnical effects.

07:46.960 --> 07:51.360
Nick Dudman was placed in charge of creature effects and Mark Stetson was in charge of

07:51.360 --> 07:52.560
the visual effects team.

07:52.560 --> 07:57.040
Digital domain would be hired for the visual effects and several different software was

07:57.040 --> 08:00.240
used to achieve the 90s visuals we've come to love today.

08:00.240 --> 08:05.360
Some shots in the film used a combination of live action, scale models, CGI, and particle

08:05.360 --> 08:06.000
systems.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.560
This is all present throughout the New York City scenes.

08:08.560 --> 08:13.280
And even though the movie came out in 1997, all of these visual effects still hold up

08:13.280 --> 08:15.040
incredibly well to this day.

08:15.040 --> 08:19.360
Fun fact, all of the stars in the background were created by poking holes in the sheet of

08:19.360 --> 08:20.320
black fabric.

08:20.320 --> 08:24.160
My favorite bit of history involving the production of this movie revolves around the

08:24.160 --> 08:25.520
New York City buildings.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.400
The production team would create scale models for the city.

08:28.480 --> 08:34.320
Apartment blocks and skyscrapers were constructed to be 20 feet high in a one 24th scale.

08:34.320 --> 08:38.720
It took a team of 80 workers five months to build all the models.

08:38.720 --> 08:42.960
The windows of the buildings were cited by the team as one of the most time consuming

08:42.960 --> 08:48.480
tasks, along with details behind the windows, including furniture, blinds, and tiny pieces

08:48.480 --> 08:49.600
of flat artwork.

08:49.600 --> 08:54.160
Of course, virtual sets were built within digital environments to enhance the miniatures

08:54.160 --> 08:56.240
and make everything seem all that more real.

08:56.400 --> 09:06.240
Because this film takes place in the 23rd century, there would need to be a different

09:06.240 --> 09:07.440
form of transportation.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.040
Flying cars, boats, and ships were constructed for the movie.

09:11.040 --> 09:14.640
Physical models were created, though, to serve as practical references.

09:14.640 --> 09:18.880
Majority of the scenes that these vehicles were in, particularly the car chase,

09:18.880 --> 09:20.400
relied on visual effects.

09:20.400 --> 09:25.360
Mark Stetson utilized a combination of CGI and practical elements so the cars would

09:25.440 --> 09:28.880
look photorealistic in camera with the busy metropolis.

09:28.880 --> 09:33.040
Blue and green screen technology was used for this as well and allowed the actors to

09:33.040 --> 09:34.880
react and interact within the vehicles.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.680
Now let's discuss the soundtrack and what a dose of nostalgia it is.

09:53.680 --> 09:58.400
The score was composed by Luc Besson's longtime collaborator, Eric Serra, and is

09:58.400 --> 10:00.640
considered intrinsically musical.

10:00.640 --> 10:06.000
Serra relied heavily on the use of orchestral texture and used many exotic influences.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.960
This can be seen in such scenes as the Stalinist fanfare heard before the spaceport,

10:13.040 --> 10:15.440
reggae music playing in preparation for the flight,

10:18.960 --> 10:23.280
and a hula music that is played when the passengers arrive on the flossing paradise ship.

10:24.480 --> 10:33.920
He would even recruit Peter Gabriel to record the song's track, Little Light of Love.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.000
The most influential and memorable song from the film is the diva dance.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.880
It takes place on the flossing ship when a blue-skinned alien opera singer is performing.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.800
It combines operatic singing with electronic futuristic elements.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.640
Serra showed soprano Inva Mula, who dubs the voice of the diva.

10:50.640 --> 10:55.200
She would tell him that some notes were not humanly possible to achieve because the human

10:55.200 --> 10:57.120
voice can't change notes that fast.

10:57.120 --> 11:01.520
She would perform the notes in isolation as opposed to singing all the notes together.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.080
These notes were then digitized to fit the music.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.240
During this scene, we see Corbin Dallas gaze and awe at her performance.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.200
It's all real because that was the first time Bruce had heard it and seen the actress in full makeup.

11:13.840 --> 11:21.600
The fifth element would make its first premiere on May 7, 1997,

11:21.600 --> 11:24.240
as the opening film for the Cannes Film Festival.

11:24.240 --> 11:29.760
Gaumont built an area for screening and included a fashion show designed by Gaultier himself,

11:29.760 --> 11:32.480
as well as fireworks and a futuristic ballet.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.000
The film would open domestically on May 9, 1997,

11:36.000 --> 11:40.240
coming in first place, earning $17 million on its opening weekend.

11:40.240 --> 11:42.800
It would go on to become a box office success,

11:42.800 --> 11:46.240
grossing over $263 million worldwide.

11:46.240 --> 11:50.400
75% of its receipts were from markets outside the US.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.200
It would become the most successful film of the French box office in 1997

11:55.200 --> 12:00.080
and would hold the record of the highest grossing French film at the foreign box office

12:00.080 --> 12:04.640
for 16 years until In Touchables was released in 2011.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.680
It currently holds a 71% on Rotten Tomatoes,

12:07.680 --> 12:10.960
with critics at the time saying it's warm, fun,

12:10.960 --> 12:15.440
and boast some of the most sophisticated production and costume design you've ever seen,

12:15.440 --> 12:18.320
while being a campy sci-fi extravaganza.

12:20.080 --> 12:25.040
Alejandro Jodorowsky and Jean Girard sued Besson after the film was released,

12:25.040 --> 12:28.400
claiming that the fifth element had plagiarized their comic, The In Call.

12:28.400 --> 12:32.880
Girard sued for 13.1 million euros for unfair competition,

12:32.960 --> 12:35.280
9 million euros in damages and interest,

12:35.280 --> 12:38.720
and 2-5% of the net operating revenues of the film.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.840
Jodorowsky sued for 700,000 euros.

12:41.840 --> 12:44.160
The case would be dismissed in 2004,

12:44.160 --> 12:47.120
on the grounds that only tiny fragments of the comic were used

12:47.120 --> 12:52.000
and that Jean had been hired by Besson to work on the film before the allegations were made.

12:52.720 --> 13:05.200
The fifth element originally released on home video in America,

13:05.200 --> 13:09.760
on December 10, 1997, to VHS, Laserdisc, and DVD.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.680
In 2001, Sony would release the film on its Superbit DVD,

13:13.680 --> 13:18.960
with superior-sounding picture quality compared to its less-than-stellar original DVD release.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.320
If you were to walk into any Bose store in the early 2000s,

13:22.320 --> 13:26.400
this movie would always be on display when purchasing a surround sound system

13:26.400 --> 13:27.600
for your home entertainment.

13:27.600 --> 13:31.920
For super fans like myself, we awaited the day that Sony would release a DVD

13:31.920 --> 13:34.320
with extras containing the making of the film.

13:34.320 --> 13:38.160
On January 11, 2005, that wait would finally be over.

13:48.960 --> 14:10.400
On June 20, 2006, Sony would then release the first Blu-ray edition of the movie

14:10.400 --> 14:14.880
and would be criticized as having poor picture quality and lack of any features.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.480
Sony would actually respond to the complaints and in a rare move,

14:18.480 --> 14:22.560
remastered the Blu-ray release on July 17, 2007.

14:22.560 --> 14:26.160
They even offered a replacement exchange program for customers who were

14:26.160 --> 14:28.080
unhappy with the original Blu-ray.

14:28.080 --> 14:31.520
Since then, Sony has released a DigiBook Blu-ray of the movie

14:31.520 --> 14:37.200
and a 20th anniversary 4K remaster, which has the best picture quality you could see for the film.

14:45.280 --> 14:50.640
This film would be nominated for Best Sound Editing at the 70th Academy Awards,

14:50.640 --> 14:52.560
but would ultimately lose to Titanic.

14:52.560 --> 14:56.800
However, it would win the BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects,

14:56.800 --> 15:00.400
and Luc Besson would take on the Lumiere's Award for Best Director.

15:00.400 --> 15:05.520
Thierry Obogost, the cinematographer on the film, was awarded the Technical Grand Prize

15:05.520 --> 15:10.800
at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival for his work on this film and She's So Lovely.

15:10.800 --> 15:15.440
It would also receive four Saturn Award nominations for Best Science Fiction Film,

15:15.440 --> 15:18.960
Best Costume, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actress.

15:26.800 --> 15:32.320
There was even a movie tie-in game by Activision that was released in 1998 for the PlayStation 1

15:32.320 --> 15:38.240
console and PC. The PS1 game is considered to be one of the worst movie tie-in games of all time,

15:38.240 --> 15:42.720
whereas the PC version was better received. I have played the PlayStation 1 version,

15:42.720 --> 15:47.760
and can say that it's incredibly frustrating and some of the worst controls I've ever played on

15:47.760 --> 15:54.480
a console. In 2001, New York Race was released on the PlayStation 2, Game Boy Color, and PC.

15:54.480 --> 15:59.040
It was a racing game based on the film and released exclusively in Europe. However,

15:59.040 --> 16:03.600
if you look around eBay or Mercari, you're bound to find a decent copy if you're into

16:03.600 --> 16:15.200
nostalgia video games. Since its initial release, the film has been considered a sci-fi cult classic.

16:15.200 --> 16:20.000
Bruce Willis would even go on to say, quote, it was a real fun movie to make, end quote,

16:20.000 --> 16:25.440
and Mila Jovovich described working with Besson as, quote, the first really amazing director I

16:25.440 --> 16:30.560
had worked with, end quote. While many people will compare it to Star Wars, which is incredible,

16:30.560 --> 16:35.040
and I have loved those movies for as long as I can remember, they aren't as special to me

16:35.040 --> 16:39.520
as the Fifth Element. I'm sure people watching this are thinking, you're crazy, and that's

16:39.520 --> 16:45.760
totally fine. As a 90s kid, my idol was Bruce Willis. From Die Hard 3, 12 Monkeys, Hudson

16:45.760 --> 16:51.040
Hawk, and The Last Boy Scout, he was a staple of my childhood. His performance, as well as the

16:51.040 --> 16:54.800
eye-opening scenes, have stayed lodged in the front of my brain forever.

17:08.720 --> 17:13.760
In conclusion, the Fifth Element is a visually inventive and entertaining film that has become

17:13.760 --> 17:19.280
a cult classic. It boasts a distinctive style, eclectic characters, and imaginative world,

17:19.280 --> 17:24.880
which all add up to what some would say, including myself, is the staple of sci-fi action films.

17:24.880 --> 17:30.080
Whether you like it or not, it's a film that offers both a fun and memorable cinematic experience.

17:49.280 --> 18:02.080
Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.660
you
