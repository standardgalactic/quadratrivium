00:00.000 --> 00:09.300
Major revelations today on the origins of COVID-19 and exactly what happened inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

00:09.300 --> 00:14.600
Well, two years ago, we broke the story here on Sky News and in the Australian

00:14.600 --> 00:22.400
that three scientists working for the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell sick with COVID-like symptoms.

00:22.700 --> 00:33.500
This was Five Eyes Intelligence and analysts suspected that these scientists may have been the first to fall sick with COVID-19,

00:33.500 --> 00:38.300
that this was the first cluster where the pandemic started.

00:38.300 --> 00:45.500
It was this intelligence that led President Joe Biden to announce a probe into the origin of the pandemic.

00:45.500 --> 00:55.800
The probe found, as you know, that intelligence agencies ultimately were divided in their assessment about whether it was a lab leak that caused the pandemic

00:55.800 --> 01:01.700
or whether the virus crossed the threshold from animals to humans naturally.

01:01.700 --> 01:13.500
Well, today, for the first time, the names of the three scientists have been published by overseas independent media outlets, public and racket.

01:13.500 --> 01:27.100
They report that according to government sources, the three scientists who first fell sick with COVID-like symptoms were Ben Hu, Yu Ping and Yan Zhu.

01:27.100 --> 01:35.500
Now, this is fascinating and it's as close as we've come to explosive information about how the pandemic started.

01:35.500 --> 01:48.000
Now, during the investigation for my book, nearly two years ago now, I first revealed that Ben Hu worked with the so-called Bat Lady, Xi Zeng Li.

01:48.000 --> 01:57.100
In January 2019, he started a project funded by the Chinese government that examined two new bat coronaviruses.

01:57.100 --> 02:08.300
His project was called the pathogenicity of two new bat-sized related coronaviruses to transgenic mice expressing human ACE2.

02:08.300 --> 02:16.100
In other words, he was experimenting to see if two new coronaviruses could infect humans.

02:16.100 --> 02:26.900
His findings were never published and the details of his project were wiped from the National Natural Science Foundation of China website.

02:26.900 --> 02:37.500
One of the researchers on my book, Luke McWilliams, made this discovery and he actually archived the page before it was deleted.

02:37.500 --> 02:43.800
Ben Hu and Xi Zeng Li's team had taken bat samples from 22 provinces in China.

02:43.800 --> 02:50.700
They detected 200 positive samples of SARS-like coronaviruses.

02:50.700 --> 03:01.900
So if this reporting by public is accurate, it looks like this scientist, Ben Hu, could have been patient zero.

03:01.900 --> 03:12.000
He could have been the first person to fall sick with COVID-19 and he was from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Xi Zeng Li's unit,

03:12.000 --> 03:18.300
working on a project that had only just kick-started in January 2019,

03:18.300 --> 03:23.400
looking at how two new bat coronaviruses could infect humans.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.100
This is huge news.

03:26.100 --> 03:31.500
Now, if you want to re-watch the incredible inside story of what really happened in Wuhan,

03:31.500 --> 03:37.300
you can have a look at that in our exclusive Sky News documentary.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.800
Nobody thought a thing like this was possible.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.000
A pandemic that affected every single person on the planet.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.800
Why didn't anyone stop this?

03:51.800 --> 03:54.800
For weeks and weeks, the Chinese government kept us silent.

03:54.800 --> 03:58.800
This is the result of taking a natural virus and mucking around with it.

03:58.800 --> 04:02.000
Hey presto, the perfect human pathogen.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.800
That actually would make a good bio-weapon.

04:03.800 --> 04:05.600
It escaped from the lab.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.800
They had had an accident.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.800
The first cluster worked into Wuhan Institute of Virology.

04:09.800 --> 04:13.000
They silenced journalists and disappeared some of them.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.800
It won't stop there.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.400
What led you to believe this came from a Wuhan lab?

04:18.400 --> 04:20.400
It was obvious there were body bags.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.400
COVID-19.

04:36.400 --> 04:42.400
Like you, it wasn't until early 2020 that I started paying attention to this.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.200
Then came the investigation.

04:45.200 --> 04:48.400
Then came the revelations.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.400
And then the writing.

04:53.400 --> 04:59.400
Tonight, join me as I tell you what I've discovered about where the virus came from

04:59.400 --> 05:02.400
and when it first appeared.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.400
Mr. President, welcome. Thank you so much for your time.

05:10.400 --> 05:12.400
Thank you very much.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
You've seen all of the intelligence.

05:14.400 --> 05:17.400
When do you think the virus first started?

05:17.400 --> 05:21.400
Well, some of the intelligence is classified and I can't talk about it.

05:21.400 --> 05:26.400
But common sense tells you it most likely, and when I say most likely,

05:26.400 --> 05:30.400
like 95% came from the Wuhan lab.

05:30.400 --> 05:35.400
I don't know if they had bad thoughts or whether it was gross incompetence,

05:35.400 --> 05:41.400
but one way or the other, it came out of Wuhan and it came from the Wuhan lab.

05:50.400 --> 05:55.400
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for His Excellency Xi Jinping,

05:55.400 --> 05:59.400
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee,

05:59.400 --> 06:02.400
President of the People's Republic of China,

06:02.400 --> 06:05.400
President-General of the Central Military Commission.

06:05.400 --> 06:08.400
They're the Olympic Games for military athletes.

06:08.400 --> 06:14.400
Held every four years, Wuhan was the host city in 2019.

06:17.400 --> 06:23.400
I didn't even know about the military games until someone from the Army called me in December of 2020

06:23.400 --> 06:27.400
and asked me if I could explain what happened at the Wuhan military games

06:27.400 --> 06:33.400
and whether these people had fallen sick with an emerging strain of COVID.

06:34.400 --> 06:41.400
As the site of a potential virus super spreader, it doesn't get much bigger than this.

06:41.400 --> 06:48.400
And in the weeks and months that followed, reports emerged of athletes becoming sick.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.400
It is suspicious.

06:53.400 --> 06:58.400
I mean, we do see some indications in our own data that NIH has

06:58.400 --> 07:01.400
that there was COVID circulating in the United States,

07:01.400 --> 07:05.400
certainly in the earliest month, as early as early December,

07:05.400 --> 07:07.400
possibly earlier than that.

07:07.400 --> 07:11.400
I mean, some of these people who came back from those games were sick with something.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.400
More than 9,000 athletes were there.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.400
Two weeks later, they returned home to more than 100 countries.

07:24.400 --> 07:29.400
Oh, I know that people got sick. I believe they're French, athletes got sick.

07:29.400 --> 07:33.400
I believe they're Germans. Some Americans got sick too.

07:33.400 --> 07:39.400
But getting sick in Wuhan in that particular time frame

07:39.400 --> 07:45.400
of the kind of symptoms that are very similar to what would later known to be coronavirus symptoms

07:45.400 --> 07:48.400
that obviously deserve investigation.

07:49.400 --> 07:55.400
No one was ever tested, but there was one man who knew something was wrong.

07:56.400 --> 08:03.400
China's most famous defector to the United States, the father of his country's democracy movement.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.400
I thought that the Chinese government would take this opportunity

08:11.400 --> 08:15.400
to spread the virus during the military games,

08:15.400 --> 08:18.400
as many foreigners would show up there.

08:24.400 --> 08:32.400
Diamond, let's start with the night Wei Jingxian came over for dinner at your house on November 22.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.400
What was different about that night?

08:34.400 --> 08:38.400
There was an urgency about Wei's manner.

08:38.400 --> 08:42.400
I mean, Wei normally is a very relaxed person.

08:42.400 --> 08:46.400
But that night was a little bit different,

08:46.400 --> 08:53.400
because he talked in almost a different tone.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.400
Diamond Liu and Wei Jingxian are close friends.

08:59.400 --> 09:03.400
She's a high-profile human rights advocate.

09:03.400 --> 09:07.400
He was once a Communist Party insider.

09:08.400 --> 09:13.400
He'd come to Diamond looking for help.

09:13.400 --> 09:19.400
Who could he tell in America there was a virus on the loose in Wuhan?

09:22.400 --> 09:24.400
Did he think this was a coronavirus?

09:24.400 --> 09:28.400
Yes, he did say it was coronavirus.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.400
How did he know about it?

09:30.400 --> 09:39.400
Well, among the Chinese diasporas, there have been talks about it.

09:39.400 --> 09:43.400
And Wei, being who he is,

09:43.400 --> 09:50.400
tends to be the recipients of many information people seek him out.

09:52.400 --> 09:58.400
Wei Jingxian spent 18 years in Chinese prisons for standing up to Beijing.

10:00.400 --> 10:06.400
In 97, he made global headlines when he defected to the United States.

10:06.400 --> 10:12.400
Wei still has impeccable contacts high up in the party.

10:12.400 --> 10:18.400
And they were telling him a virus was spreading in Wuhan in October.

10:21.400 --> 10:26.400
When did you first hear that there was a virus in Wuhan?

10:26.400 --> 10:29.400
Was it during the time of the military games?

10:29.400 --> 10:35.400
Yes, I learned there was an unusual exercise by the Chinese government

10:35.400 --> 10:37.400
during the military games.

10:37.400 --> 10:43.400
And so I told Diamond about the possibility of the Chinese government

10:43.400 --> 10:48.400
using some strange weapons, including biological weapons,

10:48.400 --> 10:53.400
because I knew they were doing experiments of that sort.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.400
There was nothing in the news at the time.

10:57.400 --> 11:00.400
I mean, no one had mentioned a thing.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.400
No, no one had mentioned a thing.

11:07.400 --> 11:12.400
Diamond wasn't the first person Wei told there was a coronavirus in Wuhan.

11:12.400 --> 11:18.400
He now tells me he passed on the same information to US intelligence

11:18.400 --> 11:23.400
and one politician as early as October 2019.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.400
It turns out Wei's warning wasn't the only piece of intelligence

11:27.400 --> 11:33.400
that agencies had at that time that warned of an outbreak in Wuhan.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
We knew this, but we didn't know it.

11:39.400 --> 11:43.400
My shock was that we actually could have had foreknowledge.

11:45.400 --> 11:49.400
David Asher is a veteran weapons investigator.

11:50.400 --> 11:55.400
He led a US government task force into the origins of COVID-19.

11:57.400 --> 12:00.400
And in late 2020, he unearthed intelligence

12:00.400 --> 12:07.400
that Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists fell sick with COVID-like symptoms.

12:09.400 --> 12:13.400
But what alarmed him was just how long Washington

12:13.400 --> 12:16.400
had sat on this classified intel.

12:17.400 --> 12:23.400
I was very surprised at the level of detail that they were able to produce

12:23.400 --> 12:28.400
around information that they had probably collected well over a year before that.

12:28.400 --> 12:34.400
So in November of 2020, we learned things that they had collected in November 2019.

12:37.400 --> 12:41.400
Wuhan is located in the central Chinese province of Hubei.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.400
It's home to 11 million people.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.400
Also in this sprawling metropolis

12:48.400 --> 12:53.400
is one of the world's leading biological research facilities,

12:53.400 --> 12:56.400
the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

12:59.400 --> 13:04.400
It was built by the French and included a cooperation agreement

13:04.400 --> 13:08.400
which meant that French scientists

13:09.400 --> 13:14.400
would be included in the research groups in Wuhan

13:14.400 --> 13:19.400
and that they would work together on this virological research.

13:19.400 --> 13:26.400
By the end of 2014, they had effectively excluded all the French that were in the institute.

13:26.400 --> 13:33.400
And the suspicion on the part of the French was that they were pushed out

13:33.400 --> 13:37.400
because of the Chinese military interest in the work.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.400
So what could this indicate about the type of research

13:40.400 --> 13:45.400
they were intending to undertake at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

13:46.400 --> 13:51.400
Well, I mean, the suggestion would be as relevant to biological warfare.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.400
In terms of coronavirus research,

14:01.400 --> 14:05.400
what was going on in the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

14:05.400 --> 14:08.400
Well, so what we do know, I mean,

14:08.400 --> 14:15.400
is that they were one of the world's leading repository of coronaviruses.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.400
That research was headed up by Shou Zhengli.

14:20.400 --> 14:23.400
They call her the Batwoman.

14:23.400 --> 14:26.400
She's China's top virologist,

14:26.400 --> 14:29.400
and her specialty, bat viruses.

14:30.400 --> 14:36.400
So it does look like COVID-19, you know, at some point,

14:36.400 --> 14:39.400
did originate as a Bat virus,

14:39.400 --> 14:43.400
that I think most people would accept that as a premise.

14:43.400 --> 14:48.400
The question then is more about how did those changes occur

14:48.400 --> 14:54.400
that make it unique and make it so well adapted to humans?

14:55.400 --> 15:00.400
In 2012, Shou Zhengli hit paydirt.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.400
At a disused mine in southwestern China,

15:03.400 --> 15:08.400
six workers fell ill after clearing away bat manure.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.400
Three died from a coronavirus,

15:15.400 --> 15:19.400
but Beijing covered it up and told no one.

15:20.400 --> 15:24.400
To a virologist obsessed with SARS-like viruses,

15:24.400 --> 15:27.400
that mine was a gold mine, pardon the pun,

15:27.400 --> 15:30.400
for new viruses to study.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.400
And they've returned to it at least five times, the Mojiang mine.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.400
That's what Xi Jinping's been doing for two decades.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.400
She's been going around various bat caves,

15:38.400 --> 15:42.400
mostly in Yunnan, China, and collecting bat viruses.

15:49.400 --> 15:51.400
Hundreds of samples were brought back

15:51.400 --> 15:55.400
to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

15:55.400 --> 15:59.400
There, scientists were slicing, manipulating,

15:59.400 --> 16:04.400
and combining genetic sequences from different viruses together.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.400
The story of the mines intriguing,

16:10.400 --> 16:14.400
one because most of us only first learned about it,

16:14.400 --> 16:17.400
you know, in early 2020,

16:17.400 --> 16:21.400
when the Wuhan Institute of Virology said,

16:21.400 --> 16:24.400
we've gone to all the viruses, coronaviruses,

16:24.400 --> 16:28.400
we've got stored in the lab to look to see,

16:28.400 --> 16:33.400
did we actually have COVID-19 in our repository?

16:33.400 --> 16:38.400
And then they said, we didn't find, you know, COVID-19.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.400
But, hey presto, we found, you know,

16:42.400 --> 16:45.400
the very closest genetic relative to this,

16:45.400 --> 16:48.400
which is rat G-13, here it is.

16:51.400 --> 16:55.400
RAT G-13 is the name of one coronavirus

16:55.400 --> 16:58.400
they extracted from the bats in those caves.

16:58.400 --> 17:05.400
It is 96.2% identical to the virus that causes COVID-19.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.400
Then the natural question is,

17:09.400 --> 17:13.400
did they find COVID-19 on one of those trips?

17:13.400 --> 17:17.400
And if so, why haven't they told us about it?

17:17.400 --> 17:21.400
Or did they manipulate, you know, rat G-13

17:21.400 --> 17:25.400
or one of the other coronaviruses that they found in this cave?

17:25.400 --> 17:28.400
And that created COVID-19.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.400
And of course, that always raises the question,

17:30.400 --> 17:34.400
well, how far did they push the boundaries?

17:34.400 --> 17:37.400
You know, what research were they doing?

17:44.400 --> 17:46.400
Oh!

17:49.400 --> 17:51.400
By early 2020,

17:51.400 --> 17:54.400
this administration has developed a very healthy

17:54.400 --> 17:57.400
and justifiable suspicion

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
of a lot of things China is saying is doing

18:00.400 --> 18:02.400
and China promised to do.

18:02.400 --> 18:06.400
Miles Yu was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's principal

18:06.400 --> 18:09.400
China adviser.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.400
As 2020 rolled in,

18:12.400 --> 18:16.400
Miles started paying close attention to Wuhan.

18:16.400 --> 18:20.400
For weeks and weeks, the Chinese government kept silent

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
on the outbreak.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.400
They're not saying anything, as if nothing is happening.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.400
So citizen journalists are beginning to send out their videos

18:28.400 --> 18:33.400
and reports and hospital situation reports on a daily basis.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.400
One of those citizen journalists is Chen Qixi.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.400
He's also a lawyer.

18:46.400 --> 18:49.400
Chen had heard China was covering up

18:49.400 --> 18:52.400
the unfolding tragedy in Wuhan.

18:52.400 --> 18:56.400
So he went there and started posting videos.

19:09.400 --> 19:21.400
And then he disappeared.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.400
Mr. President, what evidence were you presented with

19:25.400 --> 19:30.400
that convinced you that it did in all likelihood come from a lab?

19:30.400 --> 19:34.400
Well, I started hearing stories that you have also

19:34.400 --> 19:38.400
that there were lots of body bags outside of the lab.

19:38.400 --> 19:42.400
And people were saying there are a lot of people lying down

19:42.400 --> 19:47.400
on the streets of Wuhan and there were body bags.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.400
Body bags outside of the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
I heard that a long time ago.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.400
And if they did in fact have body bags,

19:55.400 --> 19:58.400
that was one little indication, wasn't it?

19:58.400 --> 20:01.400
Was that something that came from the agencies,

20:01.400 --> 20:03.400
the intelligence agencies?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.400
Is that what they were telling you?

20:05.400 --> 20:07.400
I don't know where it came from.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.400
Ask China.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.400
But you're going to have to figure that out

20:10.400 --> 20:13.400
and you probably will be able to do it knowing you.

20:13.400 --> 20:16.400
President Trump told me that there were body bags

20:16.400 --> 20:19.400
outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.400
Is this correct?

20:21.400 --> 20:23.400
I don't want to talk about particular things.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.400
Presidents get the chance to talk about things

20:25.400 --> 20:27.400
that some of the rest of us can't.

20:27.400 --> 20:32.400
But there was an enormous, albeit indirect evidence

20:32.400 --> 20:34.400
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
was the center point for this.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.400
Remember too, there were 14 American diplomats

20:39.400 --> 20:41.400
on the ground in Wuhan at this time

20:41.400 --> 20:43.400
who were watching and observing

20:43.400 --> 20:45.400
what was taking place inside of Wuhan.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.400
I hope one day that we'll be able to get that information

20:48.400 --> 20:50.400
out more broadly, but as I come back to it,

20:50.400 --> 20:53.400
the cumulative evidence that one can see

20:53.400 --> 20:56.400
points singularly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
If there was really no blame here,

21:00.400 --> 21:04.400
if this was really just some naturally occurring virus

21:04.400 --> 21:07.400
because someone ate a bat from a wet market,

21:07.400 --> 21:09.400
China wouldn't have done the things that they did.

21:09.400 --> 21:13.400
The Chinese Communist Party would not have shut down Wuhan.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.400
They would not have silenced doctors and scientists

21:17.400 --> 21:20.400
and journalists and disappeared some of them.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.400
John Ratcliffe was the United States

21:23.400 --> 21:26.400
Director of National Intelligence,

21:26.400 --> 21:30.400
the overlord of 18 different agencies.

21:33.400 --> 21:37.400
When did the intelligence community first become aware

21:37.400 --> 21:41.400
that there was a virus spreading in Wuhan?

21:41.400 --> 21:44.400
You know, in late 2019,

21:44.400 --> 21:46.400
we have intelligence from both, you know,

21:46.400 --> 21:50.400
human intelligence sources and signals intelligence sources

21:50.400 --> 21:53.400
and other intelligence sources that were telling us

21:53.400 --> 21:56.400
that there was some sort of a problem in Wuhan.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.400
Key to that assessment was intelligence

22:02.400 --> 22:06.400
that three people working in the Wuhan Institute of Virology

22:06.400 --> 22:10.400
had become sick in October 2019.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.400
This was well before the first official case

22:13.400 --> 22:16.400
was eventually announced in late December.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.400
What Mike Pompeo and I put out is, you know,

22:24.400 --> 22:27.400
people became sick at the lab in October

22:27.400 --> 22:30.400
and with symptoms that became entirely consistent

22:30.400 --> 22:33.400
with what most people have experienced

22:33.400 --> 22:36.400
around the world from COVID-19.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.400
Do you believe that to be the first cluster of the pandemic?

22:45.400 --> 22:48.400
Based on everything I've seen, this is the first cluster.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.400
Former CIA director Mike Pompeo

22:52.400 --> 22:55.400
was Secretary of State during the pandemic.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.400
His knowledge of COVID-19 was second to none

22:59.400 --> 23:01.400
in the Trump administration.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.400
I've seen no evidence that there's a cluster

23:06.400 --> 23:08.400
that began any place but this.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.400
I'm all ears to see of any evidence

23:10.400 --> 23:13.400
that presents some back set to the contrary.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.400
David Asher also agrees that this could have been

23:16.400 --> 23:20.400
the first cluster of the pandemic.

23:20.400 --> 23:25.400
My shock was that we had actually could have had four knowledge.

23:25.400 --> 23:29.400
We could have known in November of 2019

23:29.400 --> 23:34.400
that there was a disaster on curing inside Wuhan,

23:34.400 --> 23:37.400
inside their most important biological facilities.

23:37.400 --> 23:40.400
You know, we're at the top of the list

23:40.400 --> 23:43.400
of the most important biological facilities,

23:43.400 --> 23:46.400
you know, where something absolutely tragic, traumatic

23:46.400 --> 23:48.400
and dramatic was occurring,

23:48.400 --> 23:50.400
and we could have reacted to it.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.400
I said we could have, you know,

23:52.400 --> 23:54.400
the whole world could have been different.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.400
It would have been like stopping 9-11 before it happened.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.400
Which raises the question,

24:02.400 --> 24:05.400
if US intelligence knew there was a virus in Wuhan

24:05.400 --> 24:09.400
in late 2019, why didn't they do anything about it?

24:09.400 --> 24:12.400
Was this an intelligence failure?

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
We collect everything and know nothing

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
in our governments these days.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.400
It's the big data problem. We're all drowning it.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.400
We had the means to know something,

24:22.400 --> 24:26.400
but we didn't either analyze it or disseminate it,

24:26.400 --> 24:28.400
or even know that it was collected.

24:28.400 --> 24:32.400
I always worry about that as the former director of the CIA.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.400
I was always worried that we were collecting information,

24:35.400 --> 24:38.400
but we weren't able to process it sufficiently timely

24:38.400 --> 24:40.400
and get that information to the right places.

24:40.400 --> 24:44.400
Is this a pandemic that potentially could have been prevented,

24:44.400 --> 24:49.400
had the intelligence agencies paid closer attention

24:49.400 --> 24:52.400
to the information that was coming in?

24:52.400 --> 24:56.400
We'll have to go look back at what was actually in the possession,

24:56.400 --> 24:58.400
what was the complexity of the information,

24:58.400 --> 25:00.400
what was the certainty of that information.

25:00.400 --> 25:02.400
Should there be a review?

25:02.400 --> 25:06.400
Sure. I think we always could go back and look at how we collected

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
and what we knew and why it was we weren't able.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.400
That didn't send the signal up the line

25:10.400 --> 25:13.400
in a way that would have led to a better outcome.

25:19.400 --> 25:23.400
Did they survive those three workers who got sick?

25:23.400 --> 25:28.400
What I can say is that from the intelligence perspective

25:28.400 --> 25:33.400
is we know that some of the people that were most involved

25:33.400 --> 25:38.400
either infected or reporting on or whistleblowing on

25:38.400 --> 25:42.400
or trying to get answers and a journalist report on

25:42.400 --> 25:47.400
have been difficult to track down later, at least from my time there.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.400
And so I think that's consistent with what the Chinese Communist Party does.

25:51.400 --> 25:55.400
The status of those individuals and why they've disappeared,

25:55.400 --> 25:57.400
I really can't comment on that.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.400
One of those people who was reported to have disappeared was Huanyang Lin.

26:01.400 --> 26:06.400
Is she one of the ones that we believe fell sick with COVID-19?

26:06.400 --> 26:09.400
I don't know her status,

26:09.400 --> 26:14.400
but the information that you're talking about

26:14.400 --> 26:18.400
out in the public domain is consistent with what I've seen

26:18.400 --> 26:20.400
and what I'm familiar with.

26:21.400 --> 26:25.400
Huanyang Lin was a researcher at the Institute.

26:25.400 --> 26:29.400
In early 2020, she disappeared from its website.

26:29.400 --> 26:33.400
Her social media presence also vanished.

26:33.400 --> 26:40.400
Despite Beijing's denials, many believe Huang was infected with COVID-19.

26:40.400 --> 26:44.400
She's never been seen since.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.400
You know, in the West, you might say,

26:46.400 --> 26:50.400
oh, this person just want to protect her privacy.

26:50.400 --> 26:56.400
In China, privacy in the interest of the state doesn't exist.

26:56.400 --> 27:01.400
So it would have been such a big triumphant media scoop

27:01.400 --> 27:04.400
for the Chinese government to showcase her,

27:04.400 --> 27:08.400
to give like 10 seconds of her appearing somewhere, making a speech,

27:08.400 --> 27:10.400
show up in the news with media,

27:10.400 --> 27:15.400
and that would have basically scored a major victory for the Chinese propaganda machine.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.400
She never did.

27:17.400 --> 27:21.400
She is literally disappeared from public view.

27:21.400 --> 27:25.400
Making people disappear is actually a major feature of the regime.

27:25.400 --> 27:29.400
And it's actually truly a people's republic of disappearances.

27:29.400 --> 27:34.400
Dissidents, journalists, and anybody the government doesn't like,

27:34.400 --> 27:38.400
they disappear. They disappear into oblivion forever.

27:38.400 --> 27:43.400
This is basically a regime that is not only capable of doing these things

27:43.400 --> 27:45.400
and then do this with great pride.

27:48.400 --> 27:51.400
And it's not only people that go missing.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.400
On the 12th of September 2019,

27:54.400 --> 28:00.400
the virus database at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was taken offline.

28:00.400 --> 28:04.400
22,000 coronavirus samples gone.

28:09.400 --> 28:11.400
And that very same day,

28:11.400 --> 28:13.400
the Institute beefed up its security

28:13.400 --> 28:17.400
and issued a tender to replace its air conditioning system.

28:17.400 --> 28:23.400
In September is when the evidence suggests a leak first occurred.

28:25.400 --> 28:30.400
What does that indicate to you about the origins of the virus

28:30.400 --> 28:33.400
and whether an outbreak might have occurred

28:33.400 --> 28:37.400
or become known to the Wuhan Institute of Virology at that early date?

28:37.400 --> 28:41.400
So I've seen data points that place it in the summertime of 2019,

28:41.400 --> 28:44.400
late summer, July, August of 2019.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.400
These are all parts of the pieces, right?

28:46.400 --> 28:49.400
This is all the cumulative weight of the evidence

28:49.400 --> 28:52.400
that suggests that it did come from this lab.

28:53.400 --> 28:59.400
And a month later, the Institute went into a communications blackout.

28:59.400 --> 29:05.400
There was no cell phone or signals activity on the compound for about two weeks.

29:07.400 --> 29:11.400
How significant would a blackout period at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

29:11.400 --> 29:14.400
as has been reported, how significant would that be?

29:14.400 --> 29:20.400
Again, it would be another circumstance that would be difficult to explain

29:20.400 --> 29:24.400
other than there was a problem that the Chinese Communist Party was aware of

29:24.400 --> 29:30.400
and was trying to deal with before it became an outbreak that was public

29:30.400 --> 29:34.400
and then ultimately a pandemic that affected every single person on the planet.

29:34.400 --> 29:38.400
Everyone around the world assumed it had come from an animal,

29:38.400 --> 29:40.400
but we didn't know what animal.

29:41.400 --> 29:46.400
In the early days of the pandemic, Australian scientist Nikolai Petrovsky

29:46.400 --> 29:48.400
made an extraordinary discovery.

29:50.400 --> 29:56.400
I guess the first surprising result that we found that really stumped us for a while

29:56.400 --> 29:58.400
was there was no blackout.

29:58.400 --> 30:03.400
And that opened, obviously, Pandora's box, because then we had to start saying,

30:03.400 --> 30:08.400
well, if it didn't come from an animal, where did it come from?

30:08.400 --> 30:14.400
And, of course, that led into, I guess, exploration of other possibilities.

30:14.400 --> 30:20.400
And one of those, of course, was that could this have potentially have come

30:20.400 --> 30:22.400
from a laboratory?

30:22.400 --> 30:35.400
In the past repeatedly,

30:35.400 --> 30:40.400
new outbreaks and sudden development decided to remain the roliner throughout

30:40.400 --> 30:41.400
the world as a new looking event.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.400
Special to be exposed in the third or fourth year,

30:50.400 --> 31:01.440
This video was part of the official launch of the Wuhan Institute of Virology's latest

31:01.440 --> 31:09.000
lab, BSL4. It clearly shows there were bats in the lab. And that's a fact World Health

31:09.000 --> 31:16.320
Organization investigators said was a conspiracy. It was passed on to me by a group of scientists

31:16.320 --> 31:22.440
and researchers who've been digging into the origins of COVID-19. They call themselves

31:22.440 --> 31:27.520
drastic.

31:27.520 --> 31:32.760
When the outbreak happened, a lot of people noticed that it's quite a coincidence that

31:32.760 --> 31:39.880
it happened in the same city where there's this premier lab studying coronaviruses. And

31:39.880 --> 31:45.200
people were saying, well, that's suspicious. And everybody who said there could be more

31:45.200 --> 31:50.520
to it, they were called conspiracy theorists.

31:50.520 --> 31:58.360
Yuri Dagan is a genetic engineer. From Moscow, he watched COVID-19 spreading around the world.

31:58.360 --> 32:05.160
In April 2020, Yuri wrote an essay arguing that the animal-to-human theory just didn't

32:05.160 --> 32:09.840
stack up.

32:09.840 --> 32:14.680
Can you detail some of the issues that you uncovered in that medium paper that were

32:14.720 --> 32:16.800
just so crucial?

32:16.800 --> 32:23.360
Basically, it's that the Wuhan Institute of Virology that is located at the epicenter

32:23.360 --> 32:29.160
of the outbreak has been creating chimeric genetically modified coronaviruses for many,

32:29.160 --> 32:36.360
many years. And they've been putting these spike proteins from different viruses in their

32:36.360 --> 32:42.400
backbones and then studying how well does that infect human cells. Just this alone formed

32:42.440 --> 32:49.480
a very plausible argument that this is actually the lab that hosts so many different coronaviruses,

32:49.480 --> 32:53.480
explains the lab leak the best.

32:53.480 --> 32:59.440
Yuri, this was highly risky coronavirus research that was happening at the Wuhan Institute

32:59.440 --> 33:03.480
of Virology and no one seemed to be paying any attention to it.

33:03.480 --> 33:09.880
Yes, this kind of work of very dangerous, potentially pandemic pathogens being made

33:09.880 --> 33:15.040
more transmissible and potentially more lethal to humans. Nobody paid attention to it because

33:15.040 --> 33:20.040
nobody cared about this kind of work in virology until the outbreak happened.

33:25.040 --> 33:34.040
To begin with, I certainly didn't approach the issue with any sort of suspicion or foregone

33:34.040 --> 33:36.360
conclusions.

33:36.360 --> 33:44.840
However, things began to change as the pandemic evolved.

33:44.840 --> 33:51.920
So Richard Dierlove also ran into resistance to the lab leak theory. He's the former head

33:51.920 --> 33:59.920
of the British spy agency MI6. Early in the pandemic, two scientists asked for his help

33:59.920 --> 34:06.920
in publishing a paper that cast doubt on COVID-19 coming from an infected animal.

34:06.920 --> 34:14.920
We approached nature, we approached science, we approached the American Journal of Virology,

34:14.920 --> 34:23.920
we approached various publications in the UK and it was clear to me that there was a

34:23.920 --> 34:33.920
sort of united front not to put anything in the public domain which questioned the Chinese

34:33.920 --> 34:34.920
narrative.

34:34.920 --> 34:40.920
How disturbing is this censorship and do you think it amounted to Chinese disinformation?

34:40.920 --> 34:46.920
I'm pretty sure that the Chinese, after the outbreak in Wuhan and they're very good at

34:46.920 --> 34:50.920
doing this, sat down and developed their own information campaign.

34:50.920 --> 34:56.920
So Richard, you were one of the first people internationally to come out and say, this

34:56.920 --> 35:03.920
virus may be the result of a laboratory leak. How were you treated after you made those

35:03.920 --> 35:04.920
remarks?

35:04.920 --> 35:08.920
I had people saying to me, Richard, my strong advice is you don't get involved in this

35:08.920 --> 35:14.920
issue. You know, it's conspiracy theory. And I mean, my reply to them was, you know,

35:14.920 --> 35:18.920
if that's what you really think, you haven't really looked at the science, you don't

35:18.920 --> 35:23.920
understand the arguments. And I suggest you go back and delve into this a bit more deeply

35:23.920 --> 35:29.920
because you're going to find some pretty strange things when you do. Boy, did I get put-downs

35:29.920 --> 35:38.920
from, you know, some very important parts of government who basically were keen that I

35:38.920 --> 35:40.920
shut up.

35:40.920 --> 35:44.920
Was this by British government or British intelligence?

35:44.920 --> 35:51.920
I leave it to your imagination, given my past links.

35:51.920 --> 35:59.920
Another paper that struggled to find a home was from Professor Petrovsky. His research

35:59.920 --> 36:10.920
found the virus was better adapted to infect humans than any other animal, including bats.

36:10.920 --> 36:15.920
And we thought that the scientific journals, particularly the leading ones, would actually

36:15.920 --> 36:20.920
jump on this paper because they like to have papers that are very topical, that are going

36:20.920 --> 36:26.920
to get a lot of media attention. And so we were quite stunned when we just got rejection

36:26.920 --> 36:31.920
after rejection after rejection without even the paper being looked at.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.920
Professor, this is censorship of science.

36:35.920 --> 36:42.920
Absolutely. And of course, the more this happened, the more indignant I and my colleagues, you

36:42.920 --> 36:49.920
know, who were authors of the paper, became because, you know, again, science is not about

36:49.920 --> 36:56.920
politics. It's not about, you know, only finding nice things. It's about, you know, what is

36:56.920 --> 36:58.920
the truth? What are the facts?

36:58.920 --> 37:05.920
It is a sad story of unprincipled compromise in the face of an authoritarian regime. And

37:05.920 --> 37:12.920
also, it is also a sad story of political awokeness because the reason many scientists

37:12.920 --> 37:18.920
signed on to that kind of rhetoric to accuse anybody who is seriously interested in the

37:18.920 --> 37:25.920
possibility, not the certainty, but the possibility of a lab leak as simply racist.

37:28.920 --> 37:35.920
It is my profound honor to address the United Nations General Assembly. We must hold accountable

37:35.920 --> 37:40.920
the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world, China.

37:44.920 --> 37:51.920
Why were so many scientists against the lab leak theory? Well, one of the reasons was

37:51.920 --> 37:54.920
United States President Donald Trump.

37:55.920 --> 38:04.920
Yes, unfortunately, you could say that the Trump factor contaminated the argument quite

38:04.920 --> 38:12.920
seriously. And I think there were a significant number of prominent scientists who did not

38:12.920 --> 38:17.920
want publicly to appear to be supporting Trump.

38:17.920 --> 38:22.920
We saw big media say, you know what, Donald Trump and his Secretary of State are out talking

38:22.920 --> 38:27.920
about this thing. These people are surely crazy. They're political zealots. They want a shiny

38:27.920 --> 38:31.920
object. I heard all the different stories. But of course, as we unpack it, as we accumulate

38:31.920 --> 38:38.920
data science evidence facts, it's more clear than ever that the virus came from this laboratory.

38:42.920 --> 38:48.920
In early 2020, the medical journal The Lancet published a letter from a group of scientists

38:48.920 --> 38:55.920
saying the lab leak was a conspiracy. The man behind the letter was Peter Daschuk. He's

38:55.920 --> 39:00.920
the President of EcoHealth Alliance, and he'd been working with the Wuhan Institute of

39:00.920 --> 39:07.920
Virology for 15 years, sending U.S. grant money to Wuhan for bat research.

39:08.920 --> 39:15.920
He's the absolute expert on bat-borne coronaviruses in the United States and their epidemiology,

39:15.920 --> 39:22.920
and that he assures us that the Chinese had provided him personally with proof to make

39:22.920 --> 39:27.920
it clear that this had come out of nature. But when we asked for this proof, when we

39:27.920 --> 39:31.920
asked the government agencies that had funded the work of EcoHealth and others, they couldn't

39:31.920 --> 39:36.920
give us that proof, because they didn't have that proof.

39:36.920 --> 39:40.920
We looked at what certain scientists were saying, matching it with intelligence, and

39:40.920 --> 39:45.920
when it didn't match up, we were questioning it. But then, as we looked more closely at

39:45.920 --> 39:51.920
the Wuhan Institute of Virology, what a lot of scientists like Dr. Fauci and Peter Daschuk

39:51.920 --> 39:57.920
were saying was, there's no live bats there, there's no gain-of-function research there,

39:57.920 --> 40:02.920
there's no military there. And we had intelligence that was telling us that all of those things

40:02.920 --> 40:04.920
were occurring there.

40:15.920 --> 40:23.920
WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock, and we're deeply concerned both

40:23.920 --> 40:32.920
by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.

40:35.920 --> 40:41.920
It took more than 12 months from the start of the pandemic for the World Health Organization

40:41.920 --> 40:47.920
to finally send a team to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the virus.

40:48.920 --> 40:57.920
The US submitted the names of three officials, but one they didn't suggest was picked, Peter Daschuk.

40:57.920 --> 41:03.920
What we did see on the animal's side is clear evidence that the Chinese scientists showed

41:03.920 --> 41:08.920
us, they found this information out from the market, that there was a pathway into that market

41:08.920 --> 41:15.920
of animals that we know are coronavirus, reservoirs are able to carry coronaviruses from places

41:15.920 --> 41:18.920
where the nearest related viruses are found.

41:22.920 --> 41:25.920
If you're telling us it came out of nature, yeah, give us proof.

41:25.920 --> 41:31.920
When we looked for proof for jazoonosis through all of the cable traffic, all of the intelligence,

41:31.920 --> 41:35.920
everything, we could find almost nothing.

41:38.920 --> 41:42.920
It's crazy, absolutely crazy that Daschuk was the guy.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.920
He was incredibly compromised in that sense.

41:45.920 --> 41:46.920
He should have recused himself.

41:46.920 --> 41:48.920
He said, nope, I can't be part of that.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.920
I was connected to this.

41:50.920 --> 41:54.920
I was involved in the funding of things that were taking place at this laboratory.

41:54.920 --> 41:56.920
It made no sense to put him on that group.

41:56.920 --> 42:00.920
He should have seen that himself, and certainly the leaders who were making the decisions

42:00.920 --> 42:04.920
about who to have be part of that commission should have seen that this conflict of interest

42:04.920 --> 42:09.920
would deny their report, whatever it was they were going to put out, the credibility that

42:09.920 --> 42:11.920
I know they hoped that they would have.

42:12.920 --> 42:16.920
As to the possibility of COVID-19 coming from a lab,

42:16.920 --> 42:20.920
the WHO report found it extremely unlikely.

42:22.920 --> 42:25.920
They spent just three hours at the institute,

42:25.920 --> 42:28.920
and even Tedros walked away from the findings.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.920
That was a complete fiasco, the report.

42:34.920 --> 42:38.920
You know, it's 413 pages long,

42:38.920 --> 42:45.920
and only three pages are devoted to the possibility that we're dealing with a lab escapee.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.920
Well, the WHO is controlled by China.

42:53.920 --> 42:57.920
I dropped out of the World Health Organization.

42:57.920 --> 42:59.920
I thought it was ridiculous.

42:59.920 --> 43:01.920
They were late. They were wrong.

43:01.920 --> 43:03.920
They advised against travel restrictions.

43:03.920 --> 43:07.920
They objected to your travel ban from China.

43:07.920 --> 43:10.920
Well, they really did what China told them to do, if you think about it.

43:10.920 --> 43:13.920
They were like a mouthpiece for China.

43:15.920 --> 43:21.920
How beholden was the WHO and Dr. Tedros to China?

43:21.920 --> 43:22.920
Deeply beholden.

43:22.920 --> 43:30.920
Dr. Tedros owed his leadership role at the WHO to deals that were cut with the Chinese Communist Party.

43:30.920 --> 43:35.920
Dr. Tedros couldn't have been that next leader without the support of the Chinese Communist Party.

43:35.920 --> 43:41.920
And then we saw the behavior on the ground where he talked about how wonderful the Chinese Communist Party was behaving.

43:41.920 --> 43:47.920
They were doing all that they could, and we now know nothing could have been further from the truth.

43:47.920 --> 43:53.920
Again, this was the tragedy, the central tragedy of the end of 19, the beginning of 20.

43:53.920 --> 43:55.920
It became political, not scientific.

43:55.920 --> 44:00.920
It became driven by personal incentives and not the data set.

44:00.920 --> 44:05.920
Do you think there should be an investigation into Dr. Tedros's ties to China?

44:05.920 --> 44:10.920
You know, sure, but we already know an awful lot.

44:10.920 --> 44:18.920
The truth of the matter is that when the WHO was tasked with accomplishing the singular mission with which it was intended to accomplish,

44:18.920 --> 44:23.920
preventing global pandemic and the spread thereof, they fell down.

44:23.920 --> 44:26.920
And they fell down because they weren't willing to confront the perpetrator.

44:26.920 --> 44:31.920
They weren't willing to demand from the Chinese Communist Party that they'd be given access.

44:31.920 --> 44:36.920
They failed because of the absence of backbone and resolve.

44:36.920 --> 44:39.920
And the world is deeply worse off for this.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.920
Previous Ballast

45:01.920 --> 45:08.920
Before the pandemic, much of the world had never heard of the Twelve Migratory Modest letting me know,

45:08.920 --> 45:12.080
had never heard of the term gain a function.

45:12.080 --> 45:15.640
Put simply, it's genetically manipulating a virus

45:15.640 --> 45:20.640
to give it new functions, like the ability to infect humans.

45:21.080 --> 45:24.040
That's what was happening inside the Wuhan lab.

45:25.280 --> 45:27.760
You know, there's quite a logical explanation

45:27.760 --> 45:31.880
when you look at the virus and its special characteristics,

45:31.880 --> 45:34.760
that, you know, this is the result

45:34.760 --> 45:37.520
of taking a natural virus and mucking around with it.

45:39.920 --> 45:43.920
COVID-19 is like a Frankenstein virus,

45:43.920 --> 45:45.920
and it looked to many scientists

45:45.920 --> 45:48.520
like it had been cobbled together,

45:48.520 --> 45:51.320
because it has a bat virus backbone,

45:51.320 --> 45:54.320
with a pangolin virus spike protein,

45:54.320 --> 45:57.720
and a unique furan cleavage site

45:57.720 --> 46:01.320
in the same spot where Chinese scientists

46:01.320 --> 46:04.720
were genetically tweaking viruses.

46:05.520 --> 46:08.720
For those who keep bringing up, you know,

46:08.720 --> 46:14.720
the possibility of a bat in the wild markets in Wuhan,

46:14.720 --> 46:17.720
having been the source of COVID-19,

46:17.720 --> 46:22.720
scientifically, that has really no negative effect

46:22.720 --> 46:24.720
on the virus,

46:24.720 --> 46:26.720
and it's not just a disease,

46:26.720 --> 46:29.720
it's also a disease that has a negative effect

46:29.720 --> 46:31.720
on the immune system,

46:31.720 --> 46:35.720
and basically, that has really no merit

46:35.720 --> 46:37.720
because it can't infect bats,

46:37.720 --> 46:40.720
so it couldn't have come straight across from a bat

46:40.720 --> 46:42.720
if it can't infect a bat.

46:45.720 --> 46:49.720
If COVID-19 was the result of gain of function

46:49.720 --> 46:52.720
or other risky experiments at the Wuhan lab,

46:52.720 --> 46:54.720
remember this.

46:54.720 --> 46:58.720
That same lab was being partly funded by America.

47:01.720 --> 47:05.720
Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress,

47:05.720 --> 47:08.720
do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th,

47:08.720 --> 47:10.720
where you claimed that the NIH never funded

47:10.720 --> 47:12.720
gain of function research in Wuhan?

47:12.720 --> 47:16.720
Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress,

47:16.720 --> 47:19.720
and I do not retract that statement.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.720
You take an animal virus,

47:21.720 --> 47:23.720
and you increase its flexibility to humans,

47:23.720 --> 47:25.720
you're saying that's not gain of function?

47:25.720 --> 47:27.720
That is correct, and Senator Paul,

47:27.720 --> 47:30.720
you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly,

47:30.720 --> 47:33.720
and I want to say that officially.

47:37.720 --> 47:41.720
Dr. Anthony Fauci is America's top medical adviser.

47:41.720 --> 47:46.720
I found a scientific paper he wrote in 2012

47:46.720 --> 47:49.720
where he argued the benefits of gain of function research

47:49.720 --> 47:52.720
were worth the risk of a pandemic.

47:52.720 --> 47:57.720
In total, American agencies funded 65 research projects

47:57.720 --> 48:00.720
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

48:02.720 --> 48:06.720
So you don't want to go to Hoboken, New Jersey,

48:06.720 --> 48:08.720
or to Fairfax, Virginia,

48:08.720 --> 48:11.720
to be studying the bat human interface

48:11.720 --> 48:14.720
that might lead to an outbreak.

48:14.720 --> 48:16.720
So you go to China.

48:18.720 --> 48:21.720
Are you concerned at all about how it happened

48:21.720 --> 48:24.720
that the gain of function ban was lifted

48:24.720 --> 48:26.720
during the Trump administration?

48:26.720 --> 48:31.720
How was it that Anthony Fauci was able to do this

48:31.720 --> 48:33.720
without anyone knowing?

48:33.720 --> 48:35.720
Well, I don't know for sure who all was involved

48:35.720 --> 48:37.720
in that decision-making process.

48:37.720 --> 48:39.720
I can say this much when we look back

48:39.720 --> 48:41.720
and figure out how that decision was made.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.720
I hope that all of those parties were able to come to the table,

48:43.720 --> 48:45.720
express their viewpoints, their concerns,

48:45.720 --> 48:47.720
so that we had not only a decision,

48:47.720 --> 48:49.720
but an informed decision that was made.

48:49.720 --> 48:51.720
I've seen very little evidence to date

48:51.720 --> 48:54.720
that there was a broad-based information exchange

48:54.720 --> 48:56.720
before the decision was made by Dr. Fauci

48:56.720 --> 48:59.720
to lift that ban on gain of function research.

49:05.720 --> 49:08.720
Mr. President, Anthony Fauci,

49:08.720 --> 49:11.720
did he ever once mention to you

49:11.720 --> 49:13.720
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

49:13.720 --> 49:17.720
was genetically manipulating coronaviruses?

49:17.720 --> 49:19.720
Well, no, he didn't.

49:19.720 --> 49:22.720
You know, Anthony's been in government for many, many years.

49:22.720 --> 49:26.720
He's a bureaucratic kind of a guy, a very great promoter.

49:26.720 --> 49:29.720
I give him an A-plus as a promoter

49:29.720 --> 49:32.720
and probably a C or a D as a doctor.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.720
We now know from emails that have been released

49:35.720 --> 49:37.720
under the Freedom of Information Act

49:37.720 --> 49:40.720
that he was getting his advice

49:40.720 --> 49:45.720
from the likes of Peter Dajik, a Wuhan collaborator.

49:45.720 --> 49:47.720
At the same time, he was telling you

49:47.720 --> 49:49.720
that this was a natural virus.

49:49.720 --> 49:52.720
While at the same time, behind the scenes in emails,

49:52.720 --> 49:54.720
he was having discussions

49:54.720 --> 49:57.720
about whether this might have been genetically manipulated.

49:57.720 --> 49:59.720
Does that shock you?

49:59.720 --> 50:01.720
Well, he was dealing with them, certainly,

50:01.720 --> 50:04.720
and my thing was a little bit different.

50:04.720 --> 50:06.720
I just wanted to stop it.

50:06.720 --> 50:08.720
Whether it developed one way or the other,

50:08.720 --> 50:10.720
I just wanted to stop it.

50:10.720 --> 50:12.720
But it's important to know where it came from.

50:12.720 --> 50:15.720
It's extremely important to know how it developed.

50:15.720 --> 50:17.720
Fauci was dealing with them,

50:17.720 --> 50:19.720
and I guess they were even making payments

50:19.720 --> 50:21.720
for certain kinds of research.

50:21.720 --> 50:23.720
And I ended that, too. I stopped that.

50:23.720 --> 50:25.720
When we found out about that,

50:25.720 --> 50:27.720
he was doing that during the Obama years.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.720
And when I found out about it, I said,

50:29.720 --> 50:31.720
can you imagine that the United States

50:31.720 --> 50:34.720
is making payments to a Chinese lab?

50:34.720 --> 50:36.720
So just that on his face didn't make sense,

50:36.720 --> 50:38.720
but I stopped that.

50:38.720 --> 50:41.720
The Obama administration did hit pause

50:41.720 --> 50:43.720
on gain-of-function research, though,

50:43.720 --> 50:46.720
and that was lifted under your watch.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.720
Why did you allow the gain-of-function research

50:49.720 --> 50:51.720
to continue?

50:51.720 --> 50:53.720
Well, I think probably people that worked for me

50:53.720 --> 50:55.720
looked at it, and at one point

50:55.720 --> 50:57.720
they might have done that,

50:57.720 --> 50:59.720
but ultimately what we did was we shut it off.

50:59.720 --> 51:01.720
We shut the whole thing off,

51:01.720 --> 51:03.720
and we stopped making payments that were approved

51:03.720 --> 51:06.720
much earlier than our administration.

51:06.720 --> 51:09.720
Do you regret now not playing closer attention?

51:09.720 --> 51:12.720
I mean, this gain-of-function research is extremely risky.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.720
You know, banned under the Obama administration,

51:14.720 --> 51:18.720
and then kick-started in 2017 under your watch.

51:18.720 --> 51:21.720
Yeah, no, I think we've done an incredible job

51:21.720 --> 51:23.720
between the vaccine and between

51:23.720 --> 51:25.720
all of the Operation Warp Speed.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.720
I think we did a great job,

51:27.720 --> 51:30.720
and people are now starting to see what a great job we did.

51:38.720 --> 51:40.720
While writing my book,

51:40.720 --> 51:44.720
I discovered a crucial piece of the COVID-19 puzzle.

51:44.720 --> 51:47.720
Cybersecurity analysts at Internet 2.0

51:47.720 --> 51:50.720
recovered Chinese government data

51:50.720 --> 51:53.720
that had been virtually wiped from the web.

51:53.720 --> 51:57.720
It showed there was a buy-up of PCR equipment

51:57.720 --> 52:00.720
used to test for coronaviruses

52:00.720 --> 52:04.720
in Wuhan in 2019.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.720
The next month,

52:06.720 --> 52:10.720
one of those machines went to the Wuhan Institute.

52:13.720 --> 52:15.720
Is this something you're aware of

52:15.720 --> 52:19.720
that they bought a PCR machine in November 2019?

52:19.720 --> 52:22.720
I wouldn't be able to comment on that.

52:22.720 --> 52:25.720
How significant would this purchase be?

52:25.720 --> 52:27.720
Would be significant.

52:27.720 --> 52:30.720
Is it a smoking gun?

52:30.720 --> 52:32.720
Ultimately, I don't think

52:32.720 --> 52:35.720
there's ever going to be one specific smoking gun.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.720
I think there's more than just smoke here.

52:38.720 --> 52:41.720
I think there's fire from a whole bunch of different sources.

52:41.720 --> 52:44.720
I think that would be another compelling piece of evidence.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.720
If you need more, I don't need more.

52:56.720 --> 52:59.720
Mr. President, I just want to ask you about this idea

52:59.720 --> 53:02.720
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

53:02.720 --> 53:05.720
has strong ties to the Chinese military

53:05.720 --> 53:09.720
and was working on secret projects with the Chinese military.

53:09.720 --> 53:14.720
Do you think SARS-CoV-2 was developed as a bio-weapon?

53:14.720 --> 53:18.720
So I'd like to think it wasn't,

53:18.720 --> 53:20.720
and I'll probably have to leave it at that

53:20.720 --> 53:23.720
because I want to give the benefit of a doubt,

53:23.720 --> 53:25.720
and China was also affected by it.

53:25.720 --> 53:27.720
So I really don't think it was,

53:27.720 --> 53:29.720
but nobody can really know for sure,

53:29.720 --> 53:32.720
and certainly now most of that evidence is gone,

53:32.720 --> 53:35.720
and it's going to be very hard to find out.

53:36.720 --> 53:39.720
That evidence was the viral database

53:39.720 --> 53:42.720
which was taken offline by the Institute.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.720
There's also early samples that were destroyed

53:45.720 --> 53:48.720
and the people who disappeared.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.720
But what is very evident

53:50.720 --> 53:55.720
is the lab's close ties to the Chinese military.

53:55.720 --> 53:58.720
It's definitely possible that the Chinese

53:58.720 --> 54:00.720
have been working on a bio-weapon.

54:00.720 --> 54:02.720
Their labs affiliated with the PLA

54:02.720 --> 54:06.720
have been working on coronaviruses as either a bio-weapon

54:06.720 --> 54:09.720
or as a defense against a potential bio-weapon.

54:09.720 --> 54:13.720
And they've published papers in China

54:13.720 --> 54:15.720
about both aspects, saying that,

54:15.720 --> 54:17.720
oh, we can weaponize coronaviruses.

54:17.720 --> 54:20.720
That actually would make a good bio-weapon.

54:20.720 --> 54:22.720
And also they published papers and said

54:22.720 --> 54:27.720
we have to be prepared for potential released bio-weapon.

54:27.720 --> 54:30.720
Whether this precise virus is the result

54:30.720 --> 54:32.720
of a bio-weapons program,

54:32.720 --> 54:36.720
I highly doubt it, but I could not rule it out.

54:36.720 --> 54:40.720
Nor is David Asher ruling it out.

54:41.720 --> 54:44.720
In fact, the former COVID-19 investigator

54:44.720 --> 54:47.720
believes something went badly wrong

54:47.720 --> 54:50.720
inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

54:53.720 --> 54:56.720
My concern was that the Chinese were doing research

54:56.720 --> 55:00.720
in, as we learned later, quite uncontrolled circumstances

55:00.720 --> 55:02.720
that was most definitely related

55:02.720 --> 55:05.720
to biological warfare ambitions in the future,

55:05.720 --> 55:08.720
and that they had had an accident of a secretive program

55:08.720 --> 55:11.720
that they'd never wanted anyone to know about

55:11.720 --> 55:13.720
because it was a weapon.

55:13.720 --> 55:16.720
And the weapon had gotten released erroneously.

55:16.720 --> 55:18.720
I mean, it was like someone dropping a nuclear weapon

55:18.720 --> 55:22.720
at the back of a B-52 and bombing some city

55:22.720 --> 55:25.720
and saying, whoops, we didn't mean for that to occur.

55:27.720 --> 55:32.720
Do you think this was an accidental

55:32.720 --> 55:36.720
or deliberate release of COVID-19 from China?

55:36.720 --> 55:39.720
So I think it was probably an accident.

55:39.720 --> 55:42.720
I don't think it was on purpose.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.720
If it was, that's essentially war.

55:44.720 --> 55:46.720
I don't think it was on purpose.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.720
I think it was incompetence.

55:48.720 --> 55:51.720
Scientists walked out and had lunch outside

55:51.720 --> 55:54.720
in a park or something with the girlfriend,

55:54.720 --> 55:56.720
and he had it and she had it.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.720
Was that patient zero, that scientist from the lab?

55:59.720 --> 56:03.720
I don't know if it's patient zero or patient something else,

56:03.720 --> 56:05.720
but that's one theory.

56:05.720 --> 56:07.720
Do you know how he was infected?

56:07.720 --> 56:11.720
I think that it was incompetence.

56:11.720 --> 56:17.720
I think that it escaped from the lab through incompetence,

56:17.720 --> 56:19.720
and they've also had some safety problems,

56:19.720 --> 56:21.720
as you know, at that lab.

56:21.720 --> 56:24.720
The United States spoken to defectors who worked in the lab,

56:24.720 --> 56:26.720
who blew the whistle on what happened.

56:26.720 --> 56:28.720
I really can't talk about that.

56:28.720 --> 56:30.720
Yeah, I cannot talk about that.

56:30.720 --> 56:32.720
I won't be really allowed to talk.

56:32.720 --> 56:34.720
I know what I want to.

56:36.720 --> 56:41.720
Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged

56:41.720 --> 56:45.720
or found a time more challenging or difficult

56:45.720 --> 56:47.720
than the time we're in now.

56:47.720 --> 56:51.720
Once in a century virus, it silently stalks the country.

56:56.720 --> 56:59.720
Almost four months after becoming president,

56:59.720 --> 57:04.720
Joe Biden ordered a probe into the origins of COVID-19,

57:04.720 --> 57:07.720
the results inconclusive.

57:07.720 --> 57:11.720
The report found two causes plausible.

57:11.720 --> 57:16.720
Either it came from a lab or an infected animal.

57:17.720 --> 57:28.720
Is there still major intelligence that goes to proving

57:28.720 --> 57:31.720
the virus came out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology

57:31.720 --> 57:34.720
that's still not in the public domain?

57:34.720 --> 57:36.720
Yes, there's compelling intelligence

57:36.720 --> 57:38.720
that hasn't been declassified.

57:38.720 --> 57:40.720
When you declassify intelligence,

57:40.720 --> 57:45.720
you risk the potential human sources or signals intelligence,

57:45.720 --> 57:50.720
where your eyes and ears into their actions are coming from.

57:50.720 --> 57:55.720
We put out as much as we felt we could safely do at the time,

57:55.720 --> 57:58.720
but I think the time has come for the Biden administration

57:58.720 --> 58:00.720
to declassify additional information

58:00.720 --> 58:05.720
that would again, more evidence if you need it,

58:05.720 --> 58:09.720
that Chinese Communist Party officials acted badly,

58:09.720 --> 58:14.720
bullied international officials, covered up intelligence

58:14.720 --> 58:16.720
and reporting on this.

58:16.720 --> 58:18.720
There is more intelligence out there,

58:18.720 --> 58:20.720
and I'd like to see it declassified

58:20.720 --> 58:22.720
because it'll create additional pressure,

58:22.720 --> 58:24.720
not just on Chinese Communist Party officials,

58:24.720 --> 58:26.720
but others that still continue to deny

58:26.720 --> 58:28.720
that China is a bad actor here.

58:28.720 --> 58:43.720
We had an opportunity in January 2020

58:43.720 --> 58:48.720
to eradicate this virus out of the whole human population,

58:48.720 --> 58:52.720
and that's really sad because, you know,

58:52.720 --> 58:55.720
in 50 years' time, our children's children,

58:55.720 --> 58:57.720
you know, might one day look back and say,

58:57.720 --> 58:59.720
why didn't anyone stop this virus

58:59.720 --> 59:03.720
when you had the opportunity in that first few weeks?

59:14.720 --> 59:16.720
From his lab in Australia,

59:16.720 --> 59:19.720
Nikolai Petrovsky is developing a vaccine

59:19.720 --> 59:22.720
that's in phase three clinical trials,

59:22.720 --> 59:27.720
but he fears that COVID-19 may become a way of life.

59:30.720 --> 59:32.720
So viruses are opportunist.

59:32.720 --> 59:36.720
They find themselves in this wonderful new host

59:36.720 --> 59:38.720
of which there's billions,

59:38.720 --> 59:40.720
and it's learning as it goes.

59:40.720 --> 59:43.720
It started as an exquisite human pathogen.

59:43.720 --> 59:47.720
If we look now at strains like the Delta strain,

59:47.720 --> 59:50.720
you know, it's going from bad to worse.

59:50.720 --> 59:52.720
I mean, and this is what happens

59:52.720 --> 59:55.720
when you have something that is already

59:55.720 --> 59:57.720
the perfect human pathogen.

59:57.720 --> 59:59.720
It won't stop there

59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.720
because it's already, you know, has its foot in the door,

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.720
and it can only get better over time,

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.720
and that's what we're seeing,

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.720
and that's why, you know, it's been so scary.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.720
Is this what the future looks like?

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:17.720
If this virus is allowed to spread and disseminate,

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.720
it's going to learn more tricks.

01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.720
It's going to become more infectious

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.720
because that's the way viruses travel.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.720
They're opportunist.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.720
And it's going to reach a point

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.720
where we'll never actually free ourselves

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:34.720
because it's found with such a wonderful host species

01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.720
it doesn't ever want to leave.

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:41.720
How do you think this global pandemic,

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.720
this crisis of a potential laboratory leak

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.720
could impact on Chinese leadership?

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:55.720
Well, my view is that the implications of this

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.720
for the PRC leadership

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.720
are severe.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:01.720
I think it's a great opportunity

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.720
because the implications of this

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.720
for the PRC leadership are severe.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.720
There will be factions

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.720
who are hugely dissatisfied

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.720
with what has happened,

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:20.720
with the way that Chinese reputation is damaged,

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:23.720
the way that, you know, China now becomes

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.720
something akin to an international pariah.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.720
So I think the consequences of this

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.720
will be severe politically in China.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.720
Over the next four or five years, watch this space.

01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.720
Something will give, something will happen.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:40.720
And I wouldn't be a tall surprise

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.720
if it brings Xi Jinping down,

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.720
or at least there isn't a contest

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:48.720
around his concept of leadership.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.720
And as for two of the most senior members

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:04.720
of the Trump administration,

01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.720
they are in no doubt about what really happened in Wuhan.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:15.720
Well, listen, the people that had the most access

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.720
to the most intelligence are telling you

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.720
that the most likely origin of COVID-19,

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.720
of the Wuhan virus, was what happened,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.720
was a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:27.720
This is really most likely

01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.720
what happened, and it's more than just a possibility.

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:33.720
It's certainly a probability,

01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:35.720
and it's probably a certainty.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:39.720
The other thing that the cover up tells you

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:42.720
is the absolute absence of humanity of these leaders.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.720
They are willing to allow people to die.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.720
They don't care about human life.

01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.720
They don't value them the way the people in the West

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:50.720
in the United States and Australia do.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.720
They are prepared to let millions of people die

01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:56.720
if that's what it takes to protect their regime.
