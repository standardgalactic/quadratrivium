00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,300
Major revelations today on the origins of COVID-19 and exactly what happened inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,600
Well, two years ago, we broke the story here on Sky News and in the Australian

3
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:22,400
that three scientists working for the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell sick with COVID-like symptoms.

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:33,500
This was Five Eyes Intelligence and analysts suspected that these scientists may have been the first to fall sick with COVID-19,

5
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,300
that this was the first cluster where the pandemic started.

6
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:45,500
It was this intelligence that led President Joe Biden to announce a probe into the origin of the pandemic.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:55,800
The probe found, as you know, that intelligence agencies ultimately were divided in their assessment about whether it was a lab leak that caused the pandemic

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,700
or whether the virus crossed the threshold from animals to humans naturally.

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:13,500
Well, today, for the first time, the names of the three scientists have been published by overseas independent media outlets, public and racket.

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:27,100
They report that according to government sources, the three scientists who first fell sick with COVID-like symptoms were Ben Hu, Yu Ping and Yan Zhu.

11
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:35,500
Now, this is fascinating and it's as close as we've come to explosive information about how the pandemic started.

12
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:48,000
Now, during the investigation for my book, nearly two years ago now, I first revealed that Ben Hu worked with the so-called Bat Lady, Xi Zeng Li.

13
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,100
In January 2019, he started a project funded by the Chinese government that examined two new bat coronaviruses.

14
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:08,300
His project was called the pathogenicity of two new bat-sized related coronaviruses to transgenic mice expressing human ACE2.

15
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:16,100
In other words, he was experimenting to see if two new coronaviruses could infect humans.

16
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:26,900
His findings were never published and the details of his project were wiped from the National Natural Science Foundation of China website.

17
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:37,500
One of the researchers on my book, Luke McWilliams, made this discovery and he actually archived the page before it was deleted.

18
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,800
Ben Hu and Xi Zeng Li's team had taken bat samples from 22 provinces in China.

19
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,700
They detected 200 positive samples of SARS-like coronaviruses.

20
00:02:50,700 --> 00:03:01,900
So if this reporting by public is accurate, it looks like this scientist, Ben Hu, could have been patient zero.

21
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:12,000
He could have been the first person to fall sick with COVID-19 and he was from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Xi Zeng Li's unit,

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,300
working on a project that had only just kick-started in January 2019,

23
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,400
looking at how two new bat coronaviruses could infect humans.

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,100
This is huge news.

25
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:31,500
Now, if you want to re-watch the incredible inside story of what really happened in Wuhan,

26
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,300
you can have a look at that in our exclusive Sky News documentary.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,800
Nobody thought a thing like this was possible.

28
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,000
A pandemic that affected every single person on the planet.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Why didn't anyone stop this?

30
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,800
For weeks and weeks, the Chinese government kept us silent.

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
This is the result of taking a natural virus and mucking around with it.

32
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Hey presto, the perfect human pathogen.

33
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,800
That actually would make a good bio-weapon.

34
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,600
It escaped from the lab.

35
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,800
They had had an accident.

36
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,800
The first cluster worked into Wuhan Institute of Virology.

37
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,000
They silenced journalists and disappeared some of them.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,800
It won't stop there.

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,400
What led you to believe this came from a Wuhan lab?

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
It was obvious there were body bags.

41
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,400
COVID-19.

42
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Like you, it wasn't until early 2020 that I started paying attention to this.

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Then came the investigation.

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,400
Then came the revelations.

45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
And then the writing.

46
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Tonight, join me as I tell you what I've discovered about where the virus came from

47
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,400
and when it first appeared.

48
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Mr. President, welcome. Thank you so much for your time.

49
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Thank you very much.

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
You've seen all of the intelligence.

51
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
When do you think the virus first started?

52
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Well, some of the intelligence is classified and I can't talk about it.

53
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:26,400
But common sense tells you it most likely, and when I say most likely,

54
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,400
like 95% came from the Wuhan lab.

55
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I don't know if they had bad thoughts or whether it was gross incompetence,

56
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,400
but one way or the other, it came out of Wuhan and it came from the Wuhan lab.

57
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for His Excellency Xi Jinping,

58
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,400
General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee,

59
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,400
President of the People's Republic of China,

60
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
President-General of the Central Military Commission.

61
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
They're the Olympic Games for military athletes.

62
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Held every four years, Wuhan was the host city in 2019.

63
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,400
I didn't even know about the military games until someone from the Army called me in December of 2020

64
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,400
and asked me if I could explain what happened at the Wuhan military games

65
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,400
and whether these people had fallen sick with an emerging strain of COVID.

66
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,400
As the site of a potential virus super spreader, it doesn't get much bigger than this.

67
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,400
And in the weeks and months that followed, reports emerged of athletes becoming sick.

68
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
It is suspicious.

69
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I mean, we do see some indications in our own data that NIH has

70
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
that there was COVID circulating in the United States,

71
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,400
certainly in the earliest month, as early as early December,

72
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
possibly earlier than that.

73
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,400
I mean, some of these people who came back from those games were sick with something.

74
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,400
More than 9,000 athletes were there.

75
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Two weeks later, they returned home to more than 100 countries.

76
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Oh, I know that people got sick. I believe they're French, athletes got sick.

77
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I believe they're Germans. Some Americans got sick too.

78
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:39,400
But getting sick in Wuhan in that particular time frame

79
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:45,400
of the kind of symptoms that are very similar to what would later known to be coronavirus symptoms

80
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
that obviously deserve investigation.

81
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,400
No one was ever tested, but there was one man who knew something was wrong.

82
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,400
China's most famous defector to the United States, the father of his country's democracy movement.

83
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I thought that the Chinese government would take this opportunity

84
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,400
to spread the virus during the military games,

85
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,400
as many foreigners would show up there.

86
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Diamond, let's start with the night Wei Jingxian came over for dinner at your house on November 22.

87
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
What was different about that night?

88
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,400
There was an urgency about Wei's manner.

89
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,400
I mean, Wei normally is a very relaxed person.

90
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
But that night was a little bit different,

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:53,400
because he talked in almost a different tone.

92
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,400
Diamond Liu and Wei Jingxian are close friends.

93
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,400
She's a high-profile human rights advocate.

94
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,400
He was once a Communist Party insider.

95
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,400
He'd come to Diamond looking for help.

96
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Who could he tell in America there was a virus on the loose in Wuhan?

97
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Did he think this was a coronavirus?

98
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Yes, he did say it was coronavirus.

99
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
How did he know about it?

100
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Well, among the Chinese diasporas, there have been talks about it.

101
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:43,400
And Wei, being who he is,

102
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:50,400
tends to be the recipients of many information people seek him out.

103
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Wei Jingxian spent 18 years in Chinese prisons for standing up to Beijing.

104
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:06,400
In 97, he made global headlines when he defected to the United States.

105
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Wei still has impeccable contacts high up in the party.

106
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:18,400
And they were telling him a virus was spreading in Wuhan in October.

107
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:26,400
When did you first hear that there was a virus in Wuhan?

108
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Was it during the time of the military games?

109
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Yes, I learned there was an unusual exercise by the Chinese government

110
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,400
during the military games.

111
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:43,400
And so I told Diamond about the possibility of the Chinese government

112
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,400
using some strange weapons, including biological weapons,

113
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,400
because I knew they were doing experiments of that sort.

114
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,400
There was nothing in the news at the time.

115
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I mean, no one had mentioned a thing.

116
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
No, no one had mentioned a thing.

117
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Diamond wasn't the first person Wei told there was a coronavirus in Wuhan.

118
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:18,400
He now tells me he passed on the same information to US intelligence

119
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,400
and one politician as early as October 2019.

120
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,400
It turns out Wei's warning wasn't the only piece of intelligence

121
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:33,400
that agencies had at that time that warned of an outbreak in Wuhan.

122
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
We knew this, but we didn't know it.

123
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,400
My shock was that we actually could have had foreknowledge.

124
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,400
David Asher is a veteran weapons investigator.

125
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,400
He led a US government task force into the origins of COVID-19.

126
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,400
And in late 2020, he unearthed intelligence

127
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:07,400
that Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists fell sick with COVID-like symptoms.

128
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,400
But what alarmed him was just how long Washington

129
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
had sat on this classified intel.

130
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:23,400
I was very surprised at the level of detail that they were able to produce

131
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,400
around information that they had probably collected well over a year before that.

132
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,400
So in November of 2020, we learned things that they had collected in November 2019.

133
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,400
Wuhan is located in the central Chinese province of Hubei.

134
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
It's home to 11 million people.

135
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Also in this sprawling metropolis

136
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,400
is one of the world's leading biological research facilities,

137
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,400
the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

138
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:04,400
It was built by the French and included a cooperation agreement

139
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,400
which meant that French scientists

140
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,400
would be included in the research groups in Wuhan

141
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:19,400
and that they would work together on this virological research.

142
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:26,400
By the end of 2014, they had effectively excluded all the French that were in the institute.

143
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:33,400
And the suspicion on the part of the French was that they were pushed out

144
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,400
because of the Chinese military interest in the work.

145
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,400
So what could this indicate about the type of research

146
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,400
they were intending to undertake at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

147
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,400
Well, I mean, the suggestion would be as relevant to biological warfare.

148
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,400
In terms of coronavirus research,

149
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,400
what was going on in the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

150
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Well, so what we do know, I mean,

151
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:15,400
is that they were one of the world's leading repository of coronaviruses.

152
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,400
That research was headed up by Shou Zhengli.

153
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
They call her the Batwoman.

154
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,400
She's China's top virologist,

155
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,400
and her specialty, bat viruses.

156
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:36,400
So it does look like COVID-19, you know, at some point,

157
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
did originate as a Bat virus,

158
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
that I think most people would accept that as a premise.

159
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:48,400
The question then is more about how did those changes occur

160
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:54,400
that make it unique and make it so well adapted to humans?

161
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,400
In 2012, Shou Zhengli hit paydirt.

162
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
At a disused mine in southwestern China,

163
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,400
six workers fell ill after clearing away bat manure.

164
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Three died from a coronavirus,

165
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,400
but Beijing covered it up and told no one.

166
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,400
To a virologist obsessed with SARS-like viruses,

167
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,400
that mine was a gold mine, pardon the pun,

168
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
for new viruses to study.

169
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,400
And they've returned to it at least five times, the Mojiang mine.

170
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
That's what Xi Jinping's been doing for two decades.

171
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,400
She's been going around various bat caves,

172
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:42,400
mostly in Yunnan, China, and collecting bat viruses.

173
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
Hundreds of samples were brought back

174
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,400
to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

175
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,400
There, scientists were slicing, manipulating,

176
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:04,400
and combining genetic sequences from different viruses together.

177
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,400
The story of the mines intriguing,

178
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,400
one because most of us only first learned about it,

179
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,400
you know, in early 2020,

180
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,400
when the Wuhan Institute of Virology said,

181
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,400
we've gone to all the viruses, coronaviruses,

182
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,400
we've got stored in the lab to look to see,

183
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:33,400
did we actually have COVID-19 in our repository?

184
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,400
And then they said, we didn't find, you know, COVID-19.

185
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,400
But, hey presto, we found, you know,

186
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,400
the very closest genetic relative to this,

187
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,400
which is rat G-13, here it is.

188
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,400
RAT G-13 is the name of one coronavirus

189
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
they extracted from the bats in those caves.

190
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:05,400
It is 96.2% identical to the virus that causes COVID-19.

191
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
Then the natural question is,

192
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,400
did they find COVID-19 on one of those trips?

193
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,400
And if so, why haven't they told us about it?

194
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Or did they manipulate, you know, rat G-13

195
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,400
or one of the other coronaviruses that they found in this cave?

196
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
And that created COVID-19.

197
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
And of course, that always raises the question,

198
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,400
well, how far did they push the boundaries?

199
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
You know, what research were they doing?

200
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
Oh!

201
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
By early 2020,

202
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,400
this administration has developed a very healthy

203
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
and justifiable suspicion

204
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
of a lot of things China is saying is doing

205
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
and China promised to do.

206
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Miles Yu was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's principal

207
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,400
China adviser.

208
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,400
As 2020 rolled in,

209
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Miles started paying close attention to Wuhan.

210
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
For weeks and weeks, the Chinese government kept silent

211
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
on the outbreak.

212
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
They're not saying anything, as if nothing is happening.

213
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
So citizen journalists are beginning to send out their videos

214
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,400
and reports and hospital situation reports on a daily basis.

215
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
One of those citizen journalists is Chen Qixi.

216
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
He's also a lawyer.

217
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,400
Chen had heard China was covering up

218
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,400
the unfolding tragedy in Wuhan.

219
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
So he went there and started posting videos.

220
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:21,400
And then he disappeared.

221
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,400
Mr. President, what evidence were you presented with

222
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:30,400
that convinced you that it did in all likelihood come from a lab?

223
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,400
Well, I started hearing stories that you have also

224
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,400
that there were lots of body bags outside of the lab.

225
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,400
And people were saying there are a lot of people lying down

226
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,400
on the streets of Wuhan and there were body bags.

227
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,400
Body bags outside of the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

228
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
I heard that a long time ago.

229
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,400
And if they did in fact have body bags,

230
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,400
that was one little indication, wasn't it?

231
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Was that something that came from the agencies,

232
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
the intelligence agencies?

233
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Is that what they were telling you?

234
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I don't know where it came from.

235
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Ask China.

236
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
But you're going to have to figure that out

237
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
and you probably will be able to do it knowing you.

238
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,400
President Trump told me that there were body bags

239
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,400
outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

240
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Is this correct?

241
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
I don't want to talk about particular things.

242
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Presidents get the chance to talk about things

243
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
that some of the rest of us can't.

244
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,400
But there was an enormous, albeit indirect evidence

245
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

246
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
was the center point for this.

247
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,400
Remember too, there were 14 American diplomats

248
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,400
on the ground in Wuhan at this time

249
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
who were watching and observing

250
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,400
what was taking place inside of Wuhan.

251
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,400
I hope one day that we'll be able to get that information

252
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
out more broadly, but as I come back to it,

253
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,400
the cumulative evidence that one can see

254
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
points singularly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

255
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
If there was really no blame here,

256
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
if this was really just some naturally occurring virus

257
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,400
because someone ate a bat from a wet market,

258
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,400
China wouldn't have done the things that they did.

259
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,400
The Chinese Communist Party would not have shut down Wuhan.

260
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,400
They would not have silenced doctors and scientists

261
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
and journalists and disappeared some of them.

262
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
John Ratcliffe was the United States

263
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Director of National Intelligence,

264
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,400
the overlord of 18 different agencies.

265
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,400
When did the intelligence community first become aware

266
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,400
that there was a virus spreading in Wuhan?

267
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,400
You know, in late 2019,

268
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
we have intelligence from both, you know,

269
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
human intelligence sources and signals intelligence sources

270
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,400
and other intelligence sources that were telling us

271
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,400
that there was some sort of a problem in Wuhan.

272
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Key to that assessment was intelligence

273
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
that three people working in the Wuhan Institute of Virology

274
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
had become sick in October 2019.

275
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,400
This was well before the first official case

276
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,400
was eventually announced in late December.

277
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,400
What Mike Pompeo and I put out is, you know,

278
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,400
people became sick at the lab in October

279
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
and with symptoms that became entirely consistent

280
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,400
with what most people have experienced

281
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,400
around the world from COVID-19.

282
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Do you believe that to be the first cluster of the pandemic?

283
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Based on everything I've seen, this is the first cluster.

284
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
Former CIA director Mike Pompeo

285
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,400
was Secretary of State during the pandemic.

286
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,400
His knowledge of COVID-19 was second to none

287
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
in the Trump administration.

288
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
I've seen no evidence that there's a cluster

289
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
that began any place but this.

290
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
I'm all ears to see of any evidence

291
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,400
that presents some back set to the contrary.

292
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
David Asher also agrees that this could have been

293
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,400
the first cluster of the pandemic.

294
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,400
My shock was that we had actually could have had four knowledge.

295
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:29,400
We could have known in November of 2019

296
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,400
that there was a disaster on curing inside Wuhan,

297
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
inside their most important biological facilities.

298
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,400
You know, we're at the top of the list

299
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,400
of the most important biological facilities,

300
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,400
you know, where something absolutely tragic, traumatic

301
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
and dramatic was occurring,

302
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
and we could have reacted to it.

303
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
I said we could have, you know,

304
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
the whole world could have been different.

305
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,400
It would have been like stopping 9-11 before it happened.

306
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Which raises the question,

307
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,400
if US intelligence knew there was a virus in Wuhan

308
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,400
in late 2019, why didn't they do anything about it?

309
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,400
Was this an intelligence failure?

310
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
We collect everything and know nothing

311
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
in our governments these days.

312
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
It's the big data problem. We're all drowning it.

313
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
We had the means to know something,

314
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,400
but we didn't either analyze it or disseminate it,

315
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
or even know that it was collected.

316
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,400
I always worry about that as the former director of the CIA.

317
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,400
I was always worried that we were collecting information,

318
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
but we weren't able to process it sufficiently timely

319
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
and get that information to the right places.

320
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,400
Is this a pandemic that potentially could have been prevented,

321
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,400
had the intelligence agencies paid closer attention

322
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,400
to the information that was coming in?

323
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,400
We'll have to go look back at what was actually in the possession,

324
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
what was the complexity of the information,

325
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
what was the certainty of that information.

326
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
Should there be a review?

327
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,400
Sure. I think we always could go back and look at how we collected

328
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
and what we knew and why it was we weren't able.

329
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
That didn't send the signal up the line

330
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
in a way that would have led to a better outcome.

331
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Did they survive those three workers who got sick?

332
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:28,400
What I can say is that from the intelligence perspective

333
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,400
is we know that some of the people that were most involved

334
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,400
either infected or reporting on or whistleblowing on

335
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,400
or trying to get answers and a journalist report on

336
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,400
have been difficult to track down later, at least from my time there.

337
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,400
And so I think that's consistent with what the Chinese Communist Party does.

338
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,400
The status of those individuals and why they've disappeared,

339
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
I really can't comment on that.

340
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,400
One of those people who was reported to have disappeared was Huanyang Lin.

341
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Is she one of the ones that we believe fell sick with COVID-19?

342
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
I don't know her status,

343
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,400
but the information that you're talking about

344
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
out in the public domain is consistent with what I've seen

345
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
and what I'm familiar with.

346
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,400
Huanyang Lin was a researcher at the Institute.

347
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,400
In early 2020, she disappeared from its website.

348
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Her social media presence also vanished.

349
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:40,400
Despite Beijing's denials, many believe Huang was infected with COVID-19.

350
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
She's never been seen since.

351
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,400
You know, in the West, you might say,

352
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
oh, this person just want to protect her privacy.

353
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,400
In China, privacy in the interest of the state doesn't exist.

354
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,400
So it would have been such a big triumphant media scoop

355
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,400
for the Chinese government to showcase her,

356
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,400
to give like 10 seconds of her appearing somewhere, making a speech,

357
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,400
show up in the news with media,

358
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,400
and that would have basically scored a major victory for the Chinese propaganda machine.

359
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,400
She never did.

360
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,400
She is literally disappeared from public view.

361
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Making people disappear is actually a major feature of the regime.

362
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,400
And it's actually truly a people's republic of disappearances.

363
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:34,400
Dissidents, journalists, and anybody the government doesn't like,

364
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,400
they disappear. They disappear into oblivion forever.

365
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,400
This is basically a regime that is not only capable of doing these things

366
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
and then do this with great pride.

367
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,400
And it's not only people that go missing.

368
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,400
On the 12th of September 2019,

369
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,400
the virus database at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was taken offline.

370
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,400
22,000 coronavirus samples gone.

371
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,400
And that very same day,

372
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,400
the Institute beefed up its security

373
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,400
and issued a tender to replace its air conditioning system.

374
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:23,400
In September is when the evidence suggests a leak first occurred.

375
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:30,400
What does that indicate to you about the origins of the virus

376
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,400
and whether an outbreak might have occurred

377
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,400
or become known to the Wuhan Institute of Virology at that early date?

378
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,400
So I've seen data points that place it in the summertime of 2019,

379
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,400
late summer, July, August of 2019.

380
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,400
These are all parts of the pieces, right?

381
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,400
This is all the cumulative weight of the evidence

382
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,400
that suggests that it did come from this lab.

383
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,400
And a month later, the Institute went into a communications blackout.

384
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,400
There was no cell phone or signals activity on the compound for about two weeks.

385
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,400
How significant would a blackout period at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

386
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,400
as has been reported, how significant would that be?

387
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:20,400
Again, it would be another circumstance that would be difficult to explain

388
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,400
other than there was a problem that the Chinese Communist Party was aware of

389
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,400
and was trying to deal with before it became an outbreak that was public

390
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,400
and then ultimately a pandemic that affected every single person on the planet.

391
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,400
Everyone around the world assumed it had come from an animal,

392
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,400
but we didn't know what animal.

393
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:46,400
In the early days of the pandemic, Australian scientist Nikolai Petrovsky

394
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
made an extraordinary discovery.

395
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:56,400
I guess the first surprising result that we found that really stumped us for a while

396
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,400
was there was no blackout.

397
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,400
And that opened, obviously, Pandora's box, because then we had to start saying,

398
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,400
well, if it didn't come from an animal, where did it come from?

399
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:14,400
And, of course, that led into, I guess, exploration of other possibilities.

400
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:20,400
And one of those, of course, was that could this have potentially have come

401
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
from a laboratory?

402
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:35,400
In the past repeatedly,

403
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:40,400
new outbreaks and sudden development decided to remain the roliner throughout

404
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,400
the world as a new looking event.

405
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Special to be exposed in the third or fourth year,

406
00:30:50,400 --> 00:31:01,440
This video was part of the official launch of the Wuhan Institute of Virology's latest

407
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,000
lab, BSL4. It clearly shows there were bats in the lab. And that's a fact World Health

408
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:16,320
Organization investigators said was a conspiracy. It was passed on to me by a group of scientists

409
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,440
and researchers who've been digging into the origins of COVID-19. They call themselves

410
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,520
drastic.

411
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:32,760
When the outbreak happened, a lot of people noticed that it's quite a coincidence that

412
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:39,880
it happened in the same city where there's this premier lab studying coronaviruses. And

413
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,200
people were saying, well, that's suspicious. And everybody who said there could be more

414
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,520
to it, they were called conspiracy theorists.

415
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:58,360
Yuri Dagan is a genetic engineer. From Moscow, he watched COVID-19 spreading around the world.

416
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,160
In April 2020, Yuri wrote an essay arguing that the animal-to-human theory just didn't

417
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,840
stack up.

418
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,680
Can you detail some of the issues that you uncovered in that medium paper that were

419
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,800
just so crucial?

420
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:23,360
Basically, it's that the Wuhan Institute of Virology that is located at the epicenter

421
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,160
of the outbreak has been creating chimeric genetically modified coronaviruses for many,

422
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:36,360
many years. And they've been putting these spike proteins from different viruses in their

423
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:42,400
backbones and then studying how well does that infect human cells. Just this alone formed

424
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,480
a very plausible argument that this is actually the lab that hosts so many different coronaviruses,

425
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:53,480
explains the lab leak the best.

426
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,440
Yuri, this was highly risky coronavirus research that was happening at the Wuhan Institute

427
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,480
of Virology and no one seemed to be paying any attention to it.

428
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,880
Yes, this kind of work of very dangerous, potentially pandemic pathogens being made

429
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:15,040
more transmissible and potentially more lethal to humans. Nobody paid attention to it because

430
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:20,040
nobody cared about this kind of work in virology until the outbreak happened.

431
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:34,040
To begin with, I certainly didn't approach the issue with any sort of suspicion or foregone

432
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,360
conclusions.

433
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:44,840
However, things began to change as the pandemic evolved.

434
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:51,920
So Richard Dierlove also ran into resistance to the lab leak theory. He's the former head

435
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:59,920
of the British spy agency MI6. Early in the pandemic, two scientists asked for his help

436
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:06,920
in publishing a paper that cast doubt on COVID-19 coming from an infected animal.

437
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:14,920
We approached nature, we approached science, we approached the American Journal of Virology,

438
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:23,920
we approached various publications in the UK and it was clear to me that there was a

439
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:33,920
sort of united front not to put anything in the public domain which questioned the Chinese

440
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
narrative.

441
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:40,920
How disturbing is this censorship and do you think it amounted to Chinese disinformation?

442
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:46,920
I'm pretty sure that the Chinese, after the outbreak in Wuhan and they're very good at

443
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,920
doing this, sat down and developed their own information campaign.

444
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:56,920
So Richard, you were one of the first people internationally to come out and say, this

445
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:03,920
virus may be the result of a laboratory leak. How were you treated after you made those

446
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:04,920
remarks?

447
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,920
I had people saying to me, Richard, my strong advice is you don't get involved in this

448
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,920
issue. You know, it's conspiracy theory. And I mean, my reply to them was, you know,

449
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,920
if that's what you really think, you haven't really looked at the science, you don't

450
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,920
understand the arguments. And I suggest you go back and delve into this a bit more deeply

451
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,920
because you're going to find some pretty strange things when you do. Boy, did I get put-downs

452
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:38,920
from, you know, some very important parts of government who basically were keen that I

453
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
shut up.

454
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,920
Was this by British government or British intelligence?

455
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:51,920
I leave it to your imagination, given my past links.

456
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,920
Another paper that struggled to find a home was from Professor Petrovsky. His research

457
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:10,920
found the virus was better adapted to infect humans than any other animal, including bats.

458
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,920
And we thought that the scientific journals, particularly the leading ones, would actually

459
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,920
jump on this paper because they like to have papers that are very topical, that are going

460
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,920
to get a lot of media attention. And so we were quite stunned when we just got rejection

461
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:31,920
after rejection after rejection without even the paper being looked at.

462
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,920
Professor, this is censorship of science.

463
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,920
Absolutely. And of course, the more this happened, the more indignant I and my colleagues, you

464
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:49,920
know, who were authors of the paper, became because, you know, again, science is not about

465
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,920
politics. It's not about, you know, only finding nice things. It's about, you know, what is

466
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
the truth? What are the facts?

467
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:05,920
It is a sad story of unprincipled compromise in the face of an authoritarian regime. And

468
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,920
also, it is also a sad story of political awokeness because the reason many scientists

469
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,920
signed on to that kind of rhetoric to accuse anybody who is seriously interested in the

470
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,920
possibility, not the certainty, but the possibility of a lab leak as simply racist.

471
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,920
It is my profound honor to address the United Nations General Assembly. We must hold accountable

472
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,920
the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world, China.

473
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:51,920
Why were so many scientists against the lab leak theory? Well, one of the reasons was

474
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,920
United States President Donald Trump.

475
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:04,920
Yes, unfortunately, you could say that the Trump factor contaminated the argument quite

476
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,920
seriously. And I think there were a significant number of prominent scientists who did not

477
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,920
want publicly to appear to be supporting Trump.

478
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,920
We saw big media say, you know what, Donald Trump and his Secretary of State are out talking

479
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,920
about this thing. These people are surely crazy. They're political zealots. They want a shiny

480
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,920
object. I heard all the different stories. But of course, as we unpack it, as we accumulate

481
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,920
data science evidence facts, it's more clear than ever that the virus came from this laboratory.

482
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,920
In early 2020, the medical journal The Lancet published a letter from a group of scientists

483
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,920
saying the lab leak was a conspiracy. The man behind the letter was Peter Daschuk. He's

484
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,920
the President of EcoHealth Alliance, and he'd been working with the Wuhan Institute of

485
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,920
Virology for 15 years, sending U.S. grant money to Wuhan for bat research.

486
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,920
He's the absolute expert on bat-borne coronaviruses in the United States and their epidemiology,

487
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,920
and that he assures us that the Chinese had provided him personally with proof to make

488
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:27,920
it clear that this had come out of nature. But when we asked for this proof, when we

489
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,920
asked the government agencies that had funded the work of EcoHealth and others, they couldn't

490
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,920
give us that proof, because they didn't have that proof.

491
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,920
We looked at what certain scientists were saying, matching it with intelligence, and

492
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,920
when it didn't match up, we were questioning it. But then, as we looked more closely at

493
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,920
the Wuhan Institute of Virology, what a lot of scientists like Dr. Fauci and Peter Daschuk

494
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:57,920
were saying was, there's no live bats there, there's no gain-of-function research there,

495
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,920
there's no military there. And we had intelligence that was telling us that all of those things

496
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
were occurring there.

497
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:23,920
WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock, and we're deeply concerned both

498
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:32,920
by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.

499
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,920
It took more than 12 months from the start of the pandemic for the World Health Organization

500
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,920
to finally send a team to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the virus.

501
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:57,920
The US submitted the names of three officials, but one they didn't suggest was picked, Peter Daschuk.

502
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,920
What we did see on the animal's side is clear evidence that the Chinese scientists showed

503
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,920
us, they found this information out from the market, that there was a pathway into that market

504
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,920
of animals that we know are coronavirus, reservoirs are able to carry coronaviruses from places

505
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:18,920
where the nearest related viruses are found.

506
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,920
If you're telling us it came out of nature, yeah, give us proof.

507
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,920
When we looked for proof for jazoonosis through all of the cable traffic, all of the intelligence,

508
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,920
everything, we could find almost nothing.

509
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,920
It's crazy, absolutely crazy that Daschuk was the guy.

510
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,920
He was incredibly compromised in that sense.

511
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
He should have recused himself.

512
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,920
He said, nope, I can't be part of that.

513
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,920
I was connected to this.

514
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:54,920
I was involved in the funding of things that were taking place at this laboratory.

515
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,920
It made no sense to put him on that group.

516
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,920
He should have seen that himself, and certainly the leaders who were making the decisions

517
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,920
about who to have be part of that commission should have seen that this conflict of interest

518
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,920
would deny their report, whatever it was they were going to put out, the credibility that

519
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
I know they hoped that they would have.

520
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,920
As to the possibility of COVID-19 coming from a lab,

521
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,920
the WHO report found it extremely unlikely.

522
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,920
They spent just three hours at the institute,

523
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,920
and even Tedros walked away from the findings.

524
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,920
That was a complete fiasco, the report.

525
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:38,920
You know, it's 413 pages long,

526
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:45,920
and only three pages are devoted to the possibility that we're dealing with a lab escapee.

527
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:53,920
Well, the WHO is controlled by China.

528
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,920
I dropped out of the World Health Organization.

529
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,920
I thought it was ridiculous.

530
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,920
They were late. They were wrong.

531
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,920
They advised against travel restrictions.

532
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,920
They objected to your travel ban from China.

533
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,920
Well, they really did what China told them to do, if you think about it.

534
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,920
They were like a mouthpiece for China.

535
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,920
How beholden was the WHO and Dr. Tedros to China?

536
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:22,920
Deeply beholden.

537
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:30,920
Dr. Tedros owed his leadership role at the WHO to deals that were cut with the Chinese Communist Party.

538
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:35,920
Dr. Tedros couldn't have been that next leader without the support of the Chinese Communist Party.

539
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,920
And then we saw the behavior on the ground where he talked about how wonderful the Chinese Communist Party was behaving.

540
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,920
They were doing all that they could, and we now know nothing could have been further from the truth.

541
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,920
Again, this was the tragedy, the central tragedy of the end of 19, the beginning of 20.

542
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
It became political, not scientific.

543
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,920
It became driven by personal incentives and not the data set.

544
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:05,920
Do you think there should be an investigation into Dr. Tedros's ties to China?

545
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,920
You know, sure, but we already know an awful lot.

546
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:18,920
The truth of the matter is that when the WHO was tasked with accomplishing the singular mission with which it was intended to accomplish,

547
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,920
preventing global pandemic and the spread thereof, they fell down.

548
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,920
And they fell down because they weren't willing to confront the perpetrator.

549
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,920
They weren't willing to demand from the Chinese Communist Party that they'd be given access.

550
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,920
They failed because of the absence of backbone and resolve.

551
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,920
And the world is deeply worse off for this.

552
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,920
Previous Ballast

553
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:08,920
Before the pandemic, much of the world had never heard of the Twelve Migratory Modest letting me know,

554
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:12,080
had never heard of the term gain a function.

555
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:15,640
Put simply, it's genetically manipulating a virus

556
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,640
to give it new functions, like the ability to infect humans.

557
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:24,040
That's what was happening inside the Wuhan lab.

558
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,760
You know, there's quite a logical explanation

559
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,880
when you look at the virus and its special characteristics,

560
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,760
that, you know, this is the result

561
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,520
of taking a natural virus and mucking around with it.

562
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,920
COVID-19 is like a Frankenstein virus,

563
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,920
and it looked to many scientists

564
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,520
like it had been cobbled together,

565
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,320
because it has a bat virus backbone,

566
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,320
with a pangolin virus spike protein,

567
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,720
and a unique furan cleavage site

568
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,320
in the same spot where Chinese scientists

569
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:04,720
were genetically tweaking viruses.

570
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,720
For those who keep bringing up, you know,

571
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,720
the possibility of a bat in the wild markets in Wuhan,

572
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,720
having been the source of COVID-19,

573
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:22,720
scientifically, that has really no negative effect

574
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,720
on the virus,

575
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,720
and it's not just a disease,

576
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,720
it's also a disease that has a negative effect

577
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,720
on the immune system,

578
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:35,720
and basically, that has really no merit

579
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,720
because it can't infect bats,

580
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,720
so it couldn't have come straight across from a bat

581
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,720
if it can't infect a bat.

582
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,720
If COVID-19 was the result of gain of function

583
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,720
or other risky experiments at the Wuhan lab,

584
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,720
remember this.

585
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,720
That same lab was being partly funded by America.

586
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,720
Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress,

587
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,720
do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th,

588
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,720
where you claimed that the NIH never funded

589
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,720
gain of function research in Wuhan?

590
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,720
Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress,

591
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:19,720
and I do not retract that statement.

592
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,720
You take an animal virus,

593
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,720
and you increase its flexibility to humans,

594
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,720
you're saying that's not gain of function?

595
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,720
That is correct, and Senator Paul,

596
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:30,720
you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly,

597
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,720
and I want to say that officially.

598
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,720
Dr. Anthony Fauci is America's top medical adviser.

599
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,720
I found a scientific paper he wrote in 2012

600
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,720
where he argued the benefits of gain of function research

601
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,720
were worth the risk of a pandemic.

602
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:57,720
In total, American agencies funded 65 research projects

603
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,720
at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

604
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,720
So you don't want to go to Hoboken, New Jersey,

605
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,720
or to Fairfax, Virginia,

606
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,720
to be studying the bat human interface

607
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:14,720
that might lead to an outbreak.

608
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,720
So you go to China.

609
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,720
Are you concerned at all about how it happened

610
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,720
that the gain of function ban was lifted

611
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,720
during the Trump administration?

612
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,720
How was it that Anthony Fauci was able to do this

613
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,720
without anyone knowing?

614
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,720
Well, I don't know for sure who all was involved

615
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,720
in that decision-making process.

616
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,720
I can say this much when we look back

617
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
and figure out how that decision was made.

618
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
I hope that all of those parties were able to come to the table,

619
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
express their viewpoints, their concerns,

620
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,720
so that we had not only a decision,

621
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,720
but an informed decision that was made.

622
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,720
I've seen very little evidence to date

623
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:54,720
that there was a broad-based information exchange

624
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,720
before the decision was made by Dr. Fauci

625
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,720
to lift that ban on gain of function research.

626
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,720
Mr. President, Anthony Fauci,

627
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,720
did he ever once mention to you

628
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:13,720
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

629
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,720
was genetically manipulating coronaviruses?

630
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,720
Well, no, he didn't.

631
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,720
You know, Anthony's been in government for many, many years.

632
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,720
He's a bureaucratic kind of a guy, a very great promoter.

633
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,720
I give him an A-plus as a promoter

634
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,720
and probably a C or a D as a doctor.

635
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,720
We now know from emails that have been released

636
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,720
under the Freedom of Information Act

637
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,720
that he was getting his advice

638
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,720
from the likes of Peter Dajik, a Wuhan collaborator.

639
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,720
At the same time, he was telling you

640
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,720
that this was a natural virus.

641
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,720
While at the same time, behind the scenes in emails,

642
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,720
he was having discussions

643
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,720
about whether this might have been genetically manipulated.

644
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,720
Does that shock you?

645
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,720
Well, he was dealing with them, certainly,

646
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,720
and my thing was a little bit different.

647
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,720
I just wanted to stop it.

648
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,720
Whether it developed one way or the other,

649
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
I just wanted to stop it.

650
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,720
But it's important to know where it came from.

651
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,720
It's extremely important to know how it developed.

652
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,720
Fauci was dealing with them,

653
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,720
and I guess they were even making payments

654
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,720
for certain kinds of research.

655
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,720
And I ended that, too. I stopped that.

656
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,720
When we found out about that,

657
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,720
he was doing that during the Obama years.

658
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,720
And when I found out about it, I said,

659
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:31,720
can you imagine that the United States

660
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,720
is making payments to a Chinese lab?

661
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,720
So just that on his face didn't make sense,

662
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,720
but I stopped that.

663
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,720
The Obama administration did hit pause

664
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,720
on gain-of-function research, though,

665
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,720
and that was lifted under your watch.

666
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,720
Why did you allow the gain-of-function research

667
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,720
to continue?

668
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:53,720
Well, I think probably people that worked for me

669
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,720
looked at it, and at one point

670
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,720
they might have done that,

671
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,720
but ultimately what we did was we shut it off.

672
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,720
We shut the whole thing off,

673
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:03,720
and we stopped making payments that were approved

674
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,720
much earlier than our administration.

675
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,720
Do you regret now not playing closer attention?

676
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,720
I mean, this gain-of-function research is extremely risky.

677
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,720
You know, banned under the Obama administration,

678
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,720
and then kick-started in 2017 under your watch.

679
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Yeah, no, I think we've done an incredible job

680
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,720
between the vaccine and between

681
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,720
all of the Operation Warp Speed.

682
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,720
I think we did a great job,

683
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,720
and people are now starting to see what a great job we did.

684
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
While writing my book,

685
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:44,720
I discovered a crucial piece of the COVID-19 puzzle.

686
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,720
Cybersecurity analysts at Internet 2.0

687
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,720
recovered Chinese government data

688
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,720
that had been virtually wiped from the web.

689
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,720
It showed there was a buy-up of PCR equipment

690
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,720
used to test for coronaviruses

691
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,720
in Wuhan in 2019.

692
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,720
The next month,

693
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:10,720
one of those machines went to the Wuhan Institute.

694
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,720
Is this something you're aware of

695
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,720
that they bought a PCR machine in November 2019?

696
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,720
I wouldn't be able to comment on that.

697
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,720
How significant would this purchase be?

698
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,720
Would be significant.

699
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,720
Is it a smoking gun?

700
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,720
Ultimately, I don't think

701
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,720
there's ever going to be one specific smoking gun.

702
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,720
I think there's more than just smoke here.

703
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,720
I think there's fire from a whole bunch of different sources.

704
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,720
I think that would be another compelling piece of evidence.

705
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,720
If you need more, I don't need more.

706
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,720
Mr. President, I just want to ask you about this idea

707
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,720
that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

708
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,720
has strong ties to the Chinese military

709
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,720
and was working on secret projects with the Chinese military.

710
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:14,720
Do you think SARS-CoV-2 was developed as a bio-weapon?

711
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,720
So I'd like to think it wasn't,

712
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,720
and I'll probably have to leave it at that

713
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,720
because I want to give the benefit of a doubt,

714
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,720
and China was also affected by it.

715
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,720
So I really don't think it was,

716
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,720
but nobody can really know for sure,

717
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,720
and certainly now most of that evidence is gone,

718
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,720
and it's going to be very hard to find out.

719
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,720
That evidence was the viral database

720
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:42,720
which was taken offline by the Institute.

721
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,720
There's also early samples that were destroyed

722
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:48,720
and the people who disappeared.

723
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,720
But what is very evident

724
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,720
is the lab's close ties to the Chinese military.

725
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,720
It's definitely possible that the Chinese

726
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,720
have been working on a bio-weapon.

727
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:02,720
Their labs affiliated with the PLA

728
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,720
have been working on coronaviruses as either a bio-weapon

729
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,720
or as a defense against a potential bio-weapon.

730
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,720
And they've published papers in China

731
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,720
about both aspects, saying that,

732
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,720
oh, we can weaponize coronaviruses.

733
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,720
That actually would make a good bio-weapon.

734
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,720
And also they published papers and said

735
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,720
we have to be prepared for potential released bio-weapon.

736
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,720
Whether this precise virus is the result

737
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,720
of a bio-weapons program,

738
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,720
I highly doubt it, but I could not rule it out.

739
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,720
Nor is David Asher ruling it out.

740
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,720
In fact, the former COVID-19 investigator

741
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,720
believes something went badly wrong

742
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:50,720
inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

743
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,720
My concern was that the Chinese were doing research

744
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,720
in, as we learned later, quite uncontrolled circumstances

745
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,720
that was most definitely related

746
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,720
to biological warfare ambitions in the future,

747
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,720
and that they had had an accident of a secretive program

748
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,720
that they'd never wanted anyone to know about

749
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,720
because it was a weapon.

750
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,720
And the weapon had gotten released erroneously.

751
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,720
I mean, it was like someone dropping a nuclear weapon

752
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:22,720
at the back of a B-52 and bombing some city

753
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,720
and saying, whoops, we didn't mean for that to occur.

754
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:32,720
Do you think this was an accidental

755
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,720
or deliberate release of COVID-19 from China?

756
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,720
So I think it was probably an accident.

757
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,720
I don't think it was on purpose.

758
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,720
If it was, that's essentially war.

759
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,720
I don't think it was on purpose.

760
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,720
I think it was incompetence.

761
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,720
Scientists walked out and had lunch outside

762
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,720
in a park or something with the girlfriend,

763
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,720
and he had it and she had it.

764
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:59,720
Was that patient zero, that scientist from the lab?

765
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:03,720
I don't know if it's patient zero or patient something else,

766
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:05,720
but that's one theory.

767
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:07,720
Do you know how he was infected?

768
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,720
I think that it was incompetence.

769
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:17,720
I think that it escaped from the lab through incompetence,

770
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,720
and they've also had some safety problems,

771
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:21,720
as you know, at that lab.

772
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,720
The United States spoken to defectors who worked in the lab,

773
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,720
who blew the whistle on what happened.

774
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,720
I really can't talk about that.

775
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,720
Yeah, I cannot talk about that.

776
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,720
I won't be really allowed to talk.

777
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,720
I know what I want to.

778
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,720
Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged

779
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,720
or found a time more challenging or difficult

780
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,720
than the time we're in now.

781
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:51,720
Once in a century virus, it silently stalks the country.

782
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:59,720
Almost four months after becoming president,

783
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:04,720
Joe Biden ordered a probe into the origins of COVID-19,

784
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,720
the results inconclusive.

785
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:11,720
The report found two causes plausible.

786
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:16,720
Either it came from a lab or an infected animal.

787
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:28,720
Is there still major intelligence that goes to proving

788
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,720
the virus came out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology

789
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,720
that's still not in the public domain?

790
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Yes, there's compelling intelligence

791
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
that hasn't been declassified.

792
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
When you declassify intelligence,

793
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,720
you risk the potential human sources or signals intelligence,

794
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:50,720
where your eyes and ears into their actions are coming from.

795
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,720
We put out as much as we felt we could safely do at the time,

796
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,720
but I think the time has come for the Biden administration

797
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,720
to declassify additional information

798
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,720
that would again, more evidence if you need it,

799
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,720
that Chinese Communist Party officials acted badly,

800
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,720
bullied international officials, covered up intelligence

801
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,720
and reporting on this.

802
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,720
There is more intelligence out there,

803
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,720
and I'd like to see it declassified

804
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,720
because it'll create additional pressure,

805
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
not just on Chinese Communist Party officials,

806
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,720
but others that still continue to deny

807
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,720
that China is a bad actor here.

808
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:43,720
We had an opportunity in January 2020

809
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:48,720
to eradicate this virus out of the whole human population,

810
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,720
and that's really sad because, you know,

811
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,720
in 50 years' time, our children's children,

812
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:57,720
you know, might one day look back and say,

813
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,720
why didn't anyone stop this virus

814
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,720
when you had the opportunity in that first few weeks?

815
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,720
From his lab in Australia,

816
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,720
Nikolai Petrovsky is developing a vaccine

817
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,720
that's in phase three clinical trials,

818
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:27,720
but he fears that COVID-19 may become a way of life.

819
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,720
So viruses are opportunist.

820
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,720
They find themselves in this wonderful new host

821
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,720
of which there's billions,

822
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,720
and it's learning as it goes.

823
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,720
It started as an exquisite human pathogen.

824
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:47,720
If we look now at strains like the Delta strain,

825
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:50,720
you know, it's going from bad to worse.

826
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,720
I mean, and this is what happens

827
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:55,720
when you have something that is already

828
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,720
the perfect human pathogen.

829
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,720
It won't stop there

830
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:04,720
because it's already, you know, has its foot in the door,

831
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,720
and it can only get better over time,

832
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,720
and that's what we're seeing,

833
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:11,720
and that's why, you know, it's been so scary.

834
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,720
Is this what the future looks like?

835
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,720
If this virus is allowed to spread and disseminate,

836
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,720
it's going to learn more tricks.

837
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:21,720
It's going to become more infectious

838
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,720
because that's the way viruses travel.

839
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,720
They're opportunist.

840
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,720
And it's going to reach a point

841
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:31,720
where we'll never actually free ourselves

842
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,720
because it's found with such a wonderful host species

843
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,720
it doesn't ever want to leave.

844
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,720
How do you think this global pandemic,

845
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:44,720
this crisis of a potential laboratory leak

846
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:47,720
could impact on Chinese leadership?

847
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,720
Well, my view is that the implications of this

848
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,720
for the PRC leadership

849
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,720
are severe.

850
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:01,720
I think it's a great opportunity

851
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:04,720
because the implications of this

852
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,720
for the PRC leadership are severe.

853
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:11,720
There will be factions

854
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,720
who are hugely dissatisfied

855
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,720
with what has happened,

856
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:20,720
with the way that Chinese reputation is damaged,

857
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:23,720
the way that, you know, China now becomes

858
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,720
something akin to an international pariah.

859
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,720
So I think the consequences of this

860
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,720
will be severe politically in China.

861
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,720
Over the next four or five years, watch this space.

862
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,720
Something will give, something will happen.

863
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:40,720
And I wouldn't be a tall surprise

864
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,720
if it brings Xi Jinping down,

865
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,720
or at least there isn't a contest

866
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,720
around his concept of leadership.

867
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,720
And as for two of the most senior members

868
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,720
of the Trump administration,

869
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,720
they are in no doubt about what really happened in Wuhan.

870
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,720
Well, listen, the people that had the most access

871
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,720
to the most intelligence are telling you

872
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:20,720
that the most likely origin of COVID-19,

873
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,720
of the Wuhan virus, was what happened,

874
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,720
was a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

875
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,720
This is really most likely

876
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,720
what happened, and it's more than just a possibility.

877
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,720
It's certainly a probability,

878
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,720
and it's probably a certainty.

879
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,720
The other thing that the cover up tells you

880
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,720
is the absolute absence of humanity of these leaders.

881
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,720
They are willing to allow people to die.

882
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:46,720
They don't care about human life.

883
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,720
They don't value them the way the people in the West

884
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,720
in the United States and Australia do.

885
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,720
They are prepared to let millions of people die

886
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,720
if that's what it takes to protect their regime.
