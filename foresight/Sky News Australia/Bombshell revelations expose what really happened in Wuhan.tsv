0	9300	Major revelations today on the origins of COVID-19 and exactly what happened inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
9300	14600	Well, two years ago, we broke the story here on Sky News and in the Australian
14600	22400	that three scientists working for the Wuhan Institute of Virology fell sick with COVID-like symptoms.
22700	33500	This was Five Eyes Intelligence and analysts suspected that these scientists may have been the first to fall sick with COVID-19,
33500	38300	that this was the first cluster where the pandemic started.
38300	45500	It was this intelligence that led President Joe Biden to announce a probe into the origin of the pandemic.
45500	55800	The probe found, as you know, that intelligence agencies ultimately were divided in their assessment about whether it was a lab leak that caused the pandemic
55800	61700	or whether the virus crossed the threshold from animals to humans naturally.
61700	73500	Well, today, for the first time, the names of the three scientists have been published by overseas independent media outlets, public and racket.
73500	87100	They report that according to government sources, the three scientists who first fell sick with COVID-like symptoms were Ben Hu, Yu Ping and Yan Zhu.
87100	95500	Now, this is fascinating and it's as close as we've come to explosive information about how the pandemic started.
95500	108000	Now, during the investigation for my book, nearly two years ago now, I first revealed that Ben Hu worked with the so-called Bat Lady, Xi Zeng Li.
108000	117100	In January 2019, he started a project funded by the Chinese government that examined two new bat coronaviruses.
117100	128300	His project was called the pathogenicity of two new bat-sized related coronaviruses to transgenic mice expressing human ACE2.
128300	136100	In other words, he was experimenting to see if two new coronaviruses could infect humans.
136100	146900	His findings were never published and the details of his project were wiped from the National Natural Science Foundation of China website.
146900	157500	One of the researchers on my book, Luke McWilliams, made this discovery and he actually archived the page before it was deleted.
157500	163800	Ben Hu and Xi Zeng Li's team had taken bat samples from 22 provinces in China.
163800	170700	They detected 200 positive samples of SARS-like coronaviruses.
170700	181900	So if this reporting by public is accurate, it looks like this scientist, Ben Hu, could have been patient zero.
181900	192000	He could have been the first person to fall sick with COVID-19 and he was from the Wuhan Institute of Virology in Xi Zeng Li's unit,
192000	198300	working on a project that had only just kick-started in January 2019,
198300	203400	looking at how two new bat coronaviruses could infect humans.
203400	206100	This is huge news.
206100	211500	Now, if you want to re-watch the incredible inside story of what really happened in Wuhan,
211500	217300	you can have a look at that in our exclusive Sky News documentary.
223000	226800	Nobody thought a thing like this was possible.
226800	230000	A pandemic that affected every single person on the planet.
230000	231800	Why didn't anyone stop this?
231800	234800	For weeks and weeks, the Chinese government kept us silent.
234800	238800	This is the result of taking a natural virus and mucking around with it.
238800	242000	Hey presto, the perfect human pathogen.
242000	243800	That actually would make a good bio-weapon.
243800	245600	It escaped from the lab.
245600	246800	They had had an accident.
246800	249800	The first cluster worked into Wuhan Institute of Virology.
249800	253000	They silenced journalists and disappeared some of them.
253000	254800	It won't stop there.
254800	258400	What led you to believe this came from a Wuhan lab?
258400	260400	It was obvious there were body bags.
273800	276400	COVID-19.
276400	282400	Like you, it wasn't until early 2020 that I started paying attention to this.
282400	285200	Then came the investigation.
285200	288400	Then came the revelations.
288400	290400	And then the writing.
293400	299400	Tonight, join me as I tell you what I've discovered about where the virus came from
299400	302400	and when it first appeared.
307400	310400	Mr. President, welcome. Thank you so much for your time.
310400	312400	Thank you very much.
312400	314400	You've seen all of the intelligence.
314400	317400	When do you think the virus first started?
317400	321400	Well, some of the intelligence is classified and I can't talk about it.
321400	326400	But common sense tells you it most likely, and when I say most likely,
326400	330400	like 95% came from the Wuhan lab.
330400	335400	I don't know if they had bad thoughts or whether it was gross incompetence,
335400	341400	but one way or the other, it came out of Wuhan and it came from the Wuhan lab.
350400	355400	Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for His Excellency Xi Jinping,
355400	359400	General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee,
359400	362400	President of the People's Republic of China,
362400	365400	President-General of the Central Military Commission.
365400	368400	They're the Olympic Games for military athletes.
368400	374400	Held every four years, Wuhan was the host city in 2019.
377400	383400	I didn't even know about the military games until someone from the Army called me in December of 2020
383400	387400	and asked me if I could explain what happened at the Wuhan military games
387400	393400	and whether these people had fallen sick with an emerging strain of COVID.
394400	401400	As the site of a potential virus super spreader, it doesn't get much bigger than this.
401400	408400	And in the weeks and months that followed, reports emerged of athletes becoming sick.
411400	413400	It is suspicious.
413400	418400	I mean, we do see some indications in our own data that NIH has
418400	421400	that there was COVID circulating in the United States,
421400	425400	certainly in the earliest month, as early as early December,
425400	427400	possibly earlier than that.
427400	431400	I mean, some of these people who came back from those games were sick with something.
433400	436400	More than 9,000 athletes were there.
438400	442400	Two weeks later, they returned home to more than 100 countries.
444400	449400	Oh, I know that people got sick. I believe they're French, athletes got sick.
449400	453400	I believe they're Germans. Some Americans got sick too.
453400	459400	But getting sick in Wuhan in that particular time frame
459400	465400	of the kind of symptoms that are very similar to what would later known to be coronavirus symptoms
465400	468400	that obviously deserve investigation.
469400	475400	No one was ever tested, but there was one man who knew something was wrong.
476400	483400	China's most famous defector to the United States, the father of his country's democracy movement.
486400	491400	I thought that the Chinese government would take this opportunity
491400	495400	to spread the virus during the military games,
495400	498400	as many foreigners would show up there.
504400	512400	Diamond, let's start with the night Wei Jingxian came over for dinner at your house on November 22.
512400	514400	What was different about that night?
514400	518400	There was an urgency about Wei's manner.
518400	522400	I mean, Wei normally is a very relaxed person.
522400	526400	But that night was a little bit different,
526400	533400	because he talked in almost a different tone.
535400	539400	Diamond Liu and Wei Jingxian are close friends.
539400	543400	She's a high-profile human rights advocate.
543400	547400	He was once a Communist Party insider.
548400	553400	He'd come to Diamond looking for help.
553400	559400	Who could he tell in America there was a virus on the loose in Wuhan?
562400	564400	Did he think this was a coronavirus?
564400	568400	Yes, he did say it was coronavirus.
568400	570400	How did he know about it?
570400	579400	Well, among the Chinese diasporas, there have been talks about it.
579400	583400	And Wei, being who he is,
583400	590400	tends to be the recipients of many information people seek him out.
592400	598400	Wei Jingxian spent 18 years in Chinese prisons for standing up to Beijing.
600400	606400	In 97, he made global headlines when he defected to the United States.
606400	612400	Wei still has impeccable contacts high up in the party.
612400	618400	And they were telling him a virus was spreading in Wuhan in October.
621400	626400	When did you first hear that there was a virus in Wuhan?
626400	629400	Was it during the time of the military games?
629400	635400	Yes, I learned there was an unusual exercise by the Chinese government
635400	637400	during the military games.
637400	643400	And so I told Diamond about the possibility of the Chinese government
643400	648400	using some strange weapons, including biological weapons,
648400	653400	because I knew they were doing experiments of that sort.
655400	657400	There was nothing in the news at the time.
657400	660400	I mean, no one had mentioned a thing.
660400	662400	No, no one had mentioned a thing.
667400	672400	Diamond wasn't the first person Wei told there was a coronavirus in Wuhan.
672400	678400	He now tells me he passed on the same information to US intelligence
678400	683400	and one politician as early as October 2019.
683400	687400	It turns out Wei's warning wasn't the only piece of intelligence
687400	693400	that agencies had at that time that warned of an outbreak in Wuhan.
697400	699400	We knew this, but we didn't know it.
699400	703400	My shock was that we actually could have had foreknowledge.
705400	709400	David Asher is a veteran weapons investigator.
710400	715400	He led a US government task force into the origins of COVID-19.
717400	720400	And in late 2020, he unearthed intelligence
720400	727400	that Wuhan Institute of Virology scientists fell sick with COVID-like symptoms.
729400	733400	But what alarmed him was just how long Washington
733400	736400	had sat on this classified intel.
737400	743400	I was very surprised at the level of detail that they were able to produce
743400	748400	around information that they had probably collected well over a year before that.
748400	754400	So in November of 2020, we learned things that they had collected in November 2019.
757400	761400	Wuhan is located in the central Chinese province of Hubei.
762400	765400	It's home to 11 million people.
766400	768400	Also in this sprawling metropolis
768400	773400	is one of the world's leading biological research facilities,
773400	776400	the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
779400	784400	It was built by the French and included a cooperation agreement
784400	788400	which meant that French scientists
789400	794400	would be included in the research groups in Wuhan
794400	799400	and that they would work together on this virological research.
799400	806400	By the end of 2014, they had effectively excluded all the French that were in the institute.
806400	813400	And the suspicion on the part of the French was that they were pushed out
813400	817400	because of the Chinese military interest in the work.
817400	820400	So what could this indicate about the type of research
820400	825400	they were intending to undertake at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?
826400	831400	Well, I mean, the suggestion would be as relevant to biological warfare.
838400	841400	In terms of coronavirus research,
841400	845400	what was going on in the Wuhan Institute of Virology?
845400	848400	Well, so what we do know, I mean,
848400	855400	is that they were one of the world's leading repository of coronaviruses.
857400	860400	That research was headed up by Shou Zhengli.
860400	863400	They call her the Batwoman.
863400	866400	She's China's top virologist,
866400	869400	and her specialty, bat viruses.
870400	876400	So it does look like COVID-19, you know, at some point,
876400	879400	did originate as a Bat virus,
879400	883400	that I think most people would accept that as a premise.
883400	888400	The question then is more about how did those changes occur
888400	894400	that make it unique and make it so well adapted to humans?
895400	900400	In 2012, Shou Zhengli hit paydirt.
900400	903400	At a disused mine in southwestern China,
903400	908400	six workers fell ill after clearing away bat manure.
912400	915400	Three died from a coronavirus,
915400	919400	but Beijing covered it up and told no one.
920400	924400	To a virologist obsessed with SARS-like viruses,
924400	927400	that mine was a gold mine, pardon the pun,
927400	930400	for new viruses to study.
930400	933400	And they've returned to it at least five times, the Mojiang mine.
933400	935400	That's what Xi Jinping's been doing for two decades.
935400	938400	She's been going around various bat caves,
938400	942400	mostly in Yunnan, China, and collecting bat viruses.
949400	951400	Hundreds of samples were brought back
951400	955400	to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
955400	959400	There, scientists were slicing, manipulating,
959400	964400	and combining genetic sequences from different viruses together.
967400	970400	The story of the mines intriguing,
970400	974400	one because most of us only first learned about it,
974400	977400	you know, in early 2020,
977400	981400	when the Wuhan Institute of Virology said,
981400	984400	we've gone to all the viruses, coronaviruses,
984400	988400	we've got stored in the lab to look to see,
988400	993400	did we actually have COVID-19 in our repository?
993400	998400	And then they said, we didn't find, you know, COVID-19.
998400	1002400	But, hey presto, we found, you know,
1002400	1005400	the very closest genetic relative to this,
1005400	1008400	which is rat G-13, here it is.
1011400	1015400	RAT G-13 is the name of one coronavirus
1015400	1018400	they extracted from the bats in those caves.
1018400	1025400	It is 96.2% identical to the virus that causes COVID-19.
1027400	1029400	Then the natural question is,
1029400	1033400	did they find COVID-19 on one of those trips?
1033400	1037400	And if so, why haven't they told us about it?
1037400	1041400	Or did they manipulate, you know, rat G-13
1041400	1045400	or one of the other coronaviruses that they found in this cave?
1045400	1048400	And that created COVID-19.
1048400	1050400	And of course, that always raises the question,
1050400	1054400	well, how far did they push the boundaries?
1054400	1057400	You know, what research were they doing?
1064400	1066400	Oh!
1069400	1071400	By early 2020,
1071400	1074400	this administration has developed a very healthy
1074400	1077400	and justifiable suspicion
1077400	1080400	of a lot of things China is saying is doing
1080400	1082400	and China promised to do.
1082400	1086400	Miles Yu was Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's principal
1086400	1089400	China adviser.
1090400	1092400	As 2020 rolled in,
1092400	1096400	Miles started paying close attention to Wuhan.
1096400	1100400	For weeks and weeks, the Chinese government kept silent
1100400	1102400	on the outbreak.
1102400	1104400	They're not saying anything, as if nothing is happening.
1104400	1108400	So citizen journalists are beginning to send out their videos
1108400	1113400	and reports and hospital situation reports on a daily basis.
1120400	1124400	One of those citizen journalists is Chen Qixi.
1124400	1126400	He's also a lawyer.
1126400	1129400	Chen had heard China was covering up
1129400	1132400	the unfolding tragedy in Wuhan.
1132400	1136400	So he went there and started posting videos.
1149400	1161400	And then he disappeared.
1161400	1165400	Mr. President, what evidence were you presented with
1165400	1170400	that convinced you that it did in all likelihood come from a lab?
1170400	1174400	Well, I started hearing stories that you have also
1174400	1178400	that there were lots of body bags outside of the lab.
1178400	1182400	And people were saying there are a lot of people lying down
1182400	1187400	on the streets of Wuhan and there were body bags.
1187400	1191400	Body bags outside of the Wuhan Institute of Virology?
1191400	1193400	I heard that a long time ago.
1193400	1195400	And if they did in fact have body bags,
1195400	1198400	that was one little indication, wasn't it?
1198400	1201400	Was that something that came from the agencies,
1201400	1203400	the intelligence agencies?
1203400	1205400	Is that what they were telling you?
1205400	1207400	I don't know where it came from.
1207400	1208400	Ask China.
1208400	1210400	But you're going to have to figure that out
1210400	1213400	and you probably will be able to do it knowing you.
1213400	1216400	President Trump told me that there were body bags
1216400	1219400	outside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
1219400	1221400	Is this correct?
1221400	1223400	I don't want to talk about particular things.
1223400	1225400	Presidents get the chance to talk about things
1225400	1227400	that some of the rest of us can't.
1227400	1232400	But there was an enormous, albeit indirect evidence
1232400	1234400	that the Wuhan Institute of Virology
1234400	1236400	was the center point for this.
1236400	1239400	Remember too, there were 14 American diplomats
1239400	1241400	on the ground in Wuhan at this time
1241400	1243400	who were watching and observing
1243400	1245400	what was taking place inside of Wuhan.
1245400	1248400	I hope one day that we'll be able to get that information
1248400	1250400	out more broadly, but as I come back to it,
1250400	1253400	the cumulative evidence that one can see
1253400	1256400	points singularly to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
1258400	1260400	If there was really no blame here,
1260400	1264400	if this was really just some naturally occurring virus
1264400	1267400	because someone ate a bat from a wet market,
1267400	1269400	China wouldn't have done the things that they did.
1269400	1273400	The Chinese Communist Party would not have shut down Wuhan.
1273400	1277400	They would not have silenced doctors and scientists
1277400	1280400	and journalists and disappeared some of them.
1281400	1283400	John Ratcliffe was the United States
1283400	1286400	Director of National Intelligence,
1286400	1290400	the overlord of 18 different agencies.
1293400	1297400	When did the intelligence community first become aware
1297400	1301400	that there was a virus spreading in Wuhan?
1301400	1304400	You know, in late 2019,
1304400	1306400	we have intelligence from both, you know,
1306400	1310400	human intelligence sources and signals intelligence sources
1310400	1313400	and other intelligence sources that were telling us
1313400	1316400	that there was some sort of a problem in Wuhan.
1320400	1322400	Key to that assessment was intelligence
1322400	1326400	that three people working in the Wuhan Institute of Virology
1326400	1330400	had become sick in October 2019.
1330400	1333400	This was well before the first official case
1333400	1336400	was eventually announced in late December.
1341400	1344400	What Mike Pompeo and I put out is, you know,
1344400	1347400	people became sick at the lab in October
1347400	1350400	and with symptoms that became entirely consistent
1350400	1353400	with what most people have experienced
1353400	1356400	around the world from COVID-19.
1361400	1365400	Do you believe that to be the first cluster of the pandemic?
1365400	1368400	Based on everything I've seen, this is the first cluster.
1369400	1372400	Former CIA director Mike Pompeo
1372400	1375400	was Secretary of State during the pandemic.
1375400	1379400	His knowledge of COVID-19 was second to none
1379400	1381400	in the Trump administration.
1384400	1386400	I've seen no evidence that there's a cluster
1386400	1388400	that began any place but this.
1388400	1390400	I'm all ears to see of any evidence
1390400	1393400	that presents some back set to the contrary.
1393400	1396400	David Asher also agrees that this could have been
1396400	1400400	the first cluster of the pandemic.
1400400	1405400	My shock was that we had actually could have had four knowledge.
1405400	1409400	We could have known in November of 2019
1409400	1414400	that there was a disaster on curing inside Wuhan,
1414400	1417400	inside their most important biological facilities.
1417400	1420400	You know, we're at the top of the list
1420400	1423400	of the most important biological facilities,
1423400	1426400	you know, where something absolutely tragic, traumatic
1426400	1428400	and dramatic was occurring,
1428400	1430400	and we could have reacted to it.
1430400	1432400	I said we could have, you know,
1432400	1434400	the whole world could have been different.
1434400	1437400	It would have been like stopping 9-11 before it happened.
1440400	1442400	Which raises the question,
1442400	1445400	if US intelligence knew there was a virus in Wuhan
1445400	1449400	in late 2019, why didn't they do anything about it?
1449400	1452400	Was this an intelligence failure?
1454400	1456400	We collect everything and know nothing
1456400	1458400	in our governments these days.
1458400	1460400	It's the big data problem. We're all drowning it.
1460400	1462400	We had the means to know something,
1462400	1466400	but we didn't either analyze it or disseminate it,
1466400	1468400	or even know that it was collected.
1468400	1472400	I always worry about that as the former director of the CIA.
1472400	1475400	I was always worried that we were collecting information,
1475400	1478400	but we weren't able to process it sufficiently timely
1478400	1480400	and get that information to the right places.
1480400	1484400	Is this a pandemic that potentially could have been prevented,
1484400	1489400	had the intelligence agencies paid closer attention
1489400	1492400	to the information that was coming in?
1492400	1496400	We'll have to go look back at what was actually in the possession,
1496400	1498400	what was the complexity of the information,
1498400	1500400	what was the certainty of that information.
1500400	1502400	Should there be a review?
1502400	1506400	Sure. I think we always could go back and look at how we collected
1506400	1508400	and what we knew and why it was we weren't able.
1508400	1510400	That didn't send the signal up the line
1510400	1513400	in a way that would have led to a better outcome.
1519400	1523400	Did they survive those three workers who got sick?
1523400	1528400	What I can say is that from the intelligence perspective
1528400	1533400	is we know that some of the people that were most involved
1533400	1538400	either infected or reporting on or whistleblowing on
1538400	1542400	or trying to get answers and a journalist report on
1542400	1547400	have been difficult to track down later, at least from my time there.
1547400	1551400	And so I think that's consistent with what the Chinese Communist Party does.
1551400	1555400	The status of those individuals and why they've disappeared,
1555400	1557400	I really can't comment on that.
1557400	1561400	One of those people who was reported to have disappeared was Huanyang Lin.
1561400	1566400	Is she one of the ones that we believe fell sick with COVID-19?
1566400	1569400	I don't know her status,
1569400	1574400	but the information that you're talking about
1574400	1578400	out in the public domain is consistent with what I've seen
1578400	1580400	and what I'm familiar with.
1581400	1585400	Huanyang Lin was a researcher at the Institute.
1585400	1589400	In early 2020, she disappeared from its website.
1589400	1593400	Her social media presence also vanished.
1593400	1600400	Despite Beijing's denials, many believe Huang was infected with COVID-19.
1600400	1604400	She's never been seen since.
1604400	1606400	You know, in the West, you might say,
1606400	1610400	oh, this person just want to protect her privacy.
1610400	1616400	In China, privacy in the interest of the state doesn't exist.
1616400	1621400	So it would have been such a big triumphant media scoop
1621400	1624400	for the Chinese government to showcase her,
1624400	1628400	to give like 10 seconds of her appearing somewhere, making a speech,
1628400	1630400	show up in the news with media,
1630400	1635400	and that would have basically scored a major victory for the Chinese propaganda machine.
1635400	1637400	She never did.
1637400	1641400	She is literally disappeared from public view.
1641400	1645400	Making people disappear is actually a major feature of the regime.
1645400	1649400	And it's actually truly a people's republic of disappearances.
1649400	1654400	Dissidents, journalists, and anybody the government doesn't like,
1654400	1658400	they disappear. They disappear into oblivion forever.
1658400	1663400	This is basically a regime that is not only capable of doing these things
1663400	1665400	and then do this with great pride.
1668400	1671400	And it's not only people that go missing.
1671400	1674400	On the 12th of September 2019,
1674400	1680400	the virus database at the Wuhan Institute of Virology was taken offline.
1680400	1684400	22,000 coronavirus samples gone.
1689400	1691400	And that very same day,
1691400	1693400	the Institute beefed up its security
1693400	1697400	and issued a tender to replace its air conditioning system.
1697400	1703400	In September is when the evidence suggests a leak first occurred.
1705400	1710400	What does that indicate to you about the origins of the virus
1710400	1713400	and whether an outbreak might have occurred
1713400	1717400	or become known to the Wuhan Institute of Virology at that early date?
1717400	1721400	So I've seen data points that place it in the summertime of 2019,
1721400	1724400	late summer, July, August of 2019.
1724400	1726400	These are all parts of the pieces, right?
1726400	1729400	This is all the cumulative weight of the evidence
1729400	1732400	that suggests that it did come from this lab.
1733400	1739400	And a month later, the Institute went into a communications blackout.
1739400	1745400	There was no cell phone or signals activity on the compound for about two weeks.
1747400	1751400	How significant would a blackout period at the Wuhan Institute of Virology
1751400	1754400	as has been reported, how significant would that be?
1754400	1760400	Again, it would be another circumstance that would be difficult to explain
1760400	1764400	other than there was a problem that the Chinese Communist Party was aware of
1764400	1770400	and was trying to deal with before it became an outbreak that was public
1770400	1774400	and then ultimately a pandemic that affected every single person on the planet.
1774400	1778400	Everyone around the world assumed it had come from an animal,
1778400	1780400	but we didn't know what animal.
1781400	1786400	In the early days of the pandemic, Australian scientist Nikolai Petrovsky
1786400	1788400	made an extraordinary discovery.
1790400	1796400	I guess the first surprising result that we found that really stumped us for a while
1796400	1798400	was there was no blackout.
1798400	1803400	And that opened, obviously, Pandora's box, because then we had to start saying,
1803400	1808400	well, if it didn't come from an animal, where did it come from?
1808400	1814400	And, of course, that led into, I guess, exploration of other possibilities.
1814400	1820400	And one of those, of course, was that could this have potentially have come
1820400	1822400	from a laboratory?
1822400	1835400	In the past repeatedly,
1835400	1840400	new outbreaks and sudden development decided to remain the roliner throughout
1840400	1841400	the world as a new looking event.
1846400	1850400	Special to be exposed in the third or fourth year,
1850400	1861440	This video was part of the official launch of the Wuhan Institute of Virology's latest
1861440	1869000	lab, BSL4. It clearly shows there were bats in the lab. And that's a fact World Health
1869000	1876320	Organization investigators said was a conspiracy. It was passed on to me by a group of scientists
1876320	1882440	and researchers who've been digging into the origins of COVID-19. They call themselves
1882440	1887520	drastic.
1887520	1892760	When the outbreak happened, a lot of people noticed that it's quite a coincidence that
1892760	1899880	it happened in the same city where there's this premier lab studying coronaviruses. And
1899880	1905200	people were saying, well, that's suspicious. And everybody who said there could be more
1905200	1910520	to it, they were called conspiracy theorists.
1910520	1918360	Yuri Dagan is a genetic engineer. From Moscow, he watched COVID-19 spreading around the world.
1918360	1925160	In April 2020, Yuri wrote an essay arguing that the animal-to-human theory just didn't
1925160	1929840	stack up.
1929840	1934680	Can you detail some of the issues that you uncovered in that medium paper that were
1934720	1936800	just so crucial?
1936800	1943360	Basically, it's that the Wuhan Institute of Virology that is located at the epicenter
1943360	1949160	of the outbreak has been creating chimeric genetically modified coronaviruses for many,
1949160	1956360	many years. And they've been putting these spike proteins from different viruses in their
1956360	1962400	backbones and then studying how well does that infect human cells. Just this alone formed
1962440	1969480	a very plausible argument that this is actually the lab that hosts so many different coronaviruses,
1969480	1973480	explains the lab leak the best.
1973480	1979440	Yuri, this was highly risky coronavirus research that was happening at the Wuhan Institute
1979440	1983480	of Virology and no one seemed to be paying any attention to it.
1983480	1989880	Yes, this kind of work of very dangerous, potentially pandemic pathogens being made
1989880	1995040	more transmissible and potentially more lethal to humans. Nobody paid attention to it because
1995040	2000040	nobody cared about this kind of work in virology until the outbreak happened.
2005040	2014040	To begin with, I certainly didn't approach the issue with any sort of suspicion or foregone
2014040	2016360	conclusions.
2016360	2024840	However, things began to change as the pandemic evolved.
2024840	2031920	So Richard Dierlove also ran into resistance to the lab leak theory. He's the former head
2031920	2039920	of the British spy agency MI6. Early in the pandemic, two scientists asked for his help
2039920	2046920	in publishing a paper that cast doubt on COVID-19 coming from an infected animal.
2046920	2054920	We approached nature, we approached science, we approached the American Journal of Virology,
2054920	2063920	we approached various publications in the UK and it was clear to me that there was a
2063920	2073920	sort of united front not to put anything in the public domain which questioned the Chinese
2073920	2074920	narrative.
2074920	2080920	How disturbing is this censorship and do you think it amounted to Chinese disinformation?
2080920	2086920	I'm pretty sure that the Chinese, after the outbreak in Wuhan and they're very good at
2086920	2090920	doing this, sat down and developed their own information campaign.
2090920	2096920	So Richard, you were one of the first people internationally to come out and say, this
2096920	2103920	virus may be the result of a laboratory leak. How were you treated after you made those
2103920	2104920	remarks?
2104920	2108920	I had people saying to me, Richard, my strong advice is you don't get involved in this
2108920	2114920	issue. You know, it's conspiracy theory. And I mean, my reply to them was, you know,
2114920	2118920	if that's what you really think, you haven't really looked at the science, you don't
2118920	2123920	understand the arguments. And I suggest you go back and delve into this a bit more deeply
2123920	2129920	because you're going to find some pretty strange things when you do. Boy, did I get put-downs
2129920	2138920	from, you know, some very important parts of government who basically were keen that I
2138920	2140920	shut up.
2140920	2144920	Was this by British government or British intelligence?
2144920	2151920	I leave it to your imagination, given my past links.
2151920	2159920	Another paper that struggled to find a home was from Professor Petrovsky. His research
2159920	2170920	found the virus was better adapted to infect humans than any other animal, including bats.
2170920	2175920	And we thought that the scientific journals, particularly the leading ones, would actually
2175920	2180920	jump on this paper because they like to have papers that are very topical, that are going
2180920	2186920	to get a lot of media attention. And so we were quite stunned when we just got rejection
2186920	2191920	after rejection after rejection without even the paper being looked at.
2191920	2194920	Professor, this is censorship of science.
2195920	2202920	Absolutely. And of course, the more this happened, the more indignant I and my colleagues, you
2202920	2209920	know, who were authors of the paper, became because, you know, again, science is not about
2209920	2216920	politics. It's not about, you know, only finding nice things. It's about, you know, what is
2216920	2218920	the truth? What are the facts?
2218920	2225920	It is a sad story of unprincipled compromise in the face of an authoritarian regime. And
2225920	2232920	also, it is also a sad story of political awokeness because the reason many scientists
2232920	2238920	signed on to that kind of rhetoric to accuse anybody who is seriously interested in the
2238920	2245920	possibility, not the certainty, but the possibility of a lab leak as simply racist.
2248920	2255920	It is my profound honor to address the United Nations General Assembly. We must hold accountable
2255920	2260920	the nation which unleashed this plague onto the world, China.
2264920	2271920	Why were so many scientists against the lab leak theory? Well, one of the reasons was
2271920	2274920	United States President Donald Trump.
2275920	2284920	Yes, unfortunately, you could say that the Trump factor contaminated the argument quite
2284920	2292920	seriously. And I think there were a significant number of prominent scientists who did not
2292920	2297920	want publicly to appear to be supporting Trump.
2297920	2302920	We saw big media say, you know what, Donald Trump and his Secretary of State are out talking
2302920	2307920	about this thing. These people are surely crazy. They're political zealots. They want a shiny
2307920	2311920	object. I heard all the different stories. But of course, as we unpack it, as we accumulate
2311920	2318920	data science evidence facts, it's more clear than ever that the virus came from this laboratory.
2322920	2328920	In early 2020, the medical journal The Lancet published a letter from a group of scientists
2328920	2335920	saying the lab leak was a conspiracy. The man behind the letter was Peter Daschuk. He's
2335920	2340920	the President of EcoHealth Alliance, and he'd been working with the Wuhan Institute of
2340920	2347920	Virology for 15 years, sending U.S. grant money to Wuhan for bat research.
2348920	2355920	He's the absolute expert on bat-borne coronaviruses in the United States and their epidemiology,
2355920	2362920	and that he assures us that the Chinese had provided him personally with proof to make
2362920	2367920	it clear that this had come out of nature. But when we asked for this proof, when we
2367920	2371920	asked the government agencies that had funded the work of EcoHealth and others, they couldn't
2371920	2376920	give us that proof, because they didn't have that proof.
2376920	2380920	We looked at what certain scientists were saying, matching it with intelligence, and
2380920	2385920	when it didn't match up, we were questioning it. But then, as we looked more closely at
2385920	2391920	the Wuhan Institute of Virology, what a lot of scientists like Dr. Fauci and Peter Daschuk
2391920	2397920	were saying was, there's no live bats there, there's no gain-of-function research there,
2397920	2402920	there's no military there. And we had intelligence that was telling us that all of those things
2402920	2404920	were occurring there.
2415920	2423920	WHO has been assessing this outbreak around the clock, and we're deeply concerned both
2423920	2432920	by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
2435920	2441920	It took more than 12 months from the start of the pandemic for the World Health Organization
2441920	2447920	to finally send a team to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the virus.
2448920	2457920	The US submitted the names of three officials, but one they didn't suggest was picked, Peter Daschuk.
2457920	2463920	What we did see on the animal's side is clear evidence that the Chinese scientists showed
2463920	2468920	us, they found this information out from the market, that there was a pathway into that market
2468920	2475920	of animals that we know are coronavirus, reservoirs are able to carry coronaviruses from places
2475920	2478920	where the nearest related viruses are found.
2482920	2485920	If you're telling us it came out of nature, yeah, give us proof.
2485920	2491920	When we looked for proof for jazoonosis through all of the cable traffic, all of the intelligence,
2491920	2495920	everything, we could find almost nothing.
2498920	2502920	It's crazy, absolutely crazy that Daschuk was the guy.
2502920	2505920	He was incredibly compromised in that sense.
2505920	2506920	He should have recused himself.
2506920	2508920	He said, nope, I can't be part of that.
2508920	2510920	I was connected to this.
2510920	2514920	I was involved in the funding of things that were taking place at this laboratory.
2514920	2516920	It made no sense to put him on that group.
2516920	2520920	He should have seen that himself, and certainly the leaders who were making the decisions
2520920	2524920	about who to have be part of that commission should have seen that this conflict of interest
2524920	2529920	would deny their report, whatever it was they were going to put out, the credibility that
2529920	2531920	I know they hoped that they would have.
2532920	2536920	As to the possibility of COVID-19 coming from a lab,
2536920	2540920	the WHO report found it extremely unlikely.
2542920	2545920	They spent just three hours at the institute,
2545920	2548920	and even Tedros walked away from the findings.
2552920	2554920	That was a complete fiasco, the report.
2554920	2558920	You know, it's 413 pages long,
2558920	2565920	and only three pages are devoted to the possibility that we're dealing with a lab escapee.
2570920	2573920	Well, the WHO is controlled by China.
2573920	2577920	I dropped out of the World Health Organization.
2577920	2579920	I thought it was ridiculous.
2579920	2581920	They were late. They were wrong.
2581920	2583920	They advised against travel restrictions.
2583920	2587920	They objected to your travel ban from China.
2587920	2590920	Well, they really did what China told them to do, if you think about it.
2590920	2593920	They were like a mouthpiece for China.
2595920	2601920	How beholden was the WHO and Dr. Tedros to China?
2601920	2602920	Deeply beholden.
2602920	2610920	Dr. Tedros owed his leadership role at the WHO to deals that were cut with the Chinese Communist Party.
2610920	2615920	Dr. Tedros couldn't have been that next leader without the support of the Chinese Communist Party.
2615920	2621920	And then we saw the behavior on the ground where he talked about how wonderful the Chinese Communist Party was behaving.
2621920	2627920	They were doing all that they could, and we now know nothing could have been further from the truth.
2627920	2633920	Again, this was the tragedy, the central tragedy of the end of 19, the beginning of 20.
2633920	2635920	It became political, not scientific.
2635920	2640920	It became driven by personal incentives and not the data set.
2640920	2645920	Do you think there should be an investigation into Dr. Tedros's ties to China?
2645920	2650920	You know, sure, but we already know an awful lot.
2650920	2658920	The truth of the matter is that when the WHO was tasked with accomplishing the singular mission with which it was intended to accomplish,
2658920	2663920	preventing global pandemic and the spread thereof, they fell down.
2663920	2666920	And they fell down because they weren't willing to confront the perpetrator.
2666920	2671920	They weren't willing to demand from the Chinese Communist Party that they'd be given access.
2671920	2676920	They failed because of the absence of backbone and resolve.
2676920	2679920	And the world is deeply worse off for this.
2680920	2683920	Previous Ballast
2701920	2708920	Before the pandemic, much of the world had never heard of the Twelve Migratory Modest letting me know,
2708920	2712080	had never heard of the term gain a function.
2712080	2715640	Put simply, it's genetically manipulating a virus
2715640	2720640	to give it new functions, like the ability to infect humans.
2721080	2724040	That's what was happening inside the Wuhan lab.
2725280	2727760	You know, there's quite a logical explanation
2727760	2731880	when you look at the virus and its special characteristics,
2731880	2734760	that, you know, this is the result
2734760	2737520	of taking a natural virus and mucking around with it.
2739920	2743920	COVID-19 is like a Frankenstein virus,
2743920	2745920	and it looked to many scientists
2745920	2748520	like it had been cobbled together,
2748520	2751320	because it has a bat virus backbone,
2751320	2754320	with a pangolin virus spike protein,
2754320	2757720	and a unique furan cleavage site
2757720	2761320	in the same spot where Chinese scientists
2761320	2764720	were genetically tweaking viruses.
2765520	2768720	For those who keep bringing up, you know,
2768720	2774720	the possibility of a bat in the wild markets in Wuhan,
2774720	2777720	having been the source of COVID-19,
2777720	2782720	scientifically, that has really no negative effect
2782720	2784720	on the virus,
2784720	2786720	and it's not just a disease,
2786720	2789720	it's also a disease that has a negative effect
2789720	2791720	on the immune system,
2791720	2795720	and basically, that has really no merit
2795720	2797720	because it can't infect bats,
2797720	2800720	so it couldn't have come straight across from a bat
2800720	2802720	if it can't infect a bat.
2805720	2809720	If COVID-19 was the result of gain of function
2809720	2812720	or other risky experiments at the Wuhan lab,
2812720	2814720	remember this.
2814720	2818720	That same lab was being partly funded by America.
2821720	2825720	Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress,
2825720	2828720	do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th,
2828720	2830720	where you claimed that the NIH never funded
2830720	2832720	gain of function research in Wuhan?
2832720	2836720	Senator Paul, I have never lied before the Congress,
2836720	2839720	and I do not retract that statement.
2839720	2841720	You take an animal virus,
2841720	2843720	and you increase its flexibility to humans,
2843720	2845720	you're saying that's not gain of function?
2845720	2847720	That is correct, and Senator Paul,
2847720	2850720	you do not know what you are talking about, quite frankly,
2850720	2853720	and I want to say that officially.
2857720	2861720	Dr. Anthony Fauci is America's top medical adviser.
2861720	2866720	I found a scientific paper he wrote in 2012
2866720	2869720	where he argued the benefits of gain of function research
2869720	2872720	were worth the risk of a pandemic.
2872720	2877720	In total, American agencies funded 65 research projects
2877720	2880720	at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
2882720	2886720	So you don't want to go to Hoboken, New Jersey,
2886720	2888720	or to Fairfax, Virginia,
2888720	2891720	to be studying the bat human interface
2891720	2894720	that might lead to an outbreak.
2894720	2896720	So you go to China.
2898720	2901720	Are you concerned at all about how it happened
2901720	2904720	that the gain of function ban was lifted
2904720	2906720	during the Trump administration?
2906720	2911720	How was it that Anthony Fauci was able to do this
2911720	2913720	without anyone knowing?
2913720	2915720	Well, I don't know for sure who all was involved
2915720	2917720	in that decision-making process.
2917720	2919720	I can say this much when we look back
2919720	2921720	and figure out how that decision was made.
2921720	2923720	I hope that all of those parties were able to come to the table,
2923720	2925720	express their viewpoints, their concerns,
2925720	2927720	so that we had not only a decision,
2927720	2929720	but an informed decision that was made.
2929720	2931720	I've seen very little evidence to date
2931720	2934720	that there was a broad-based information exchange
2934720	2936720	before the decision was made by Dr. Fauci
2936720	2939720	to lift that ban on gain of function research.
2945720	2948720	Mr. President, Anthony Fauci,
2948720	2951720	did he ever once mention to you
2951720	2953720	that the Wuhan Institute of Virology
2953720	2957720	was genetically manipulating coronaviruses?
2957720	2959720	Well, no, he didn't.
2959720	2962720	You know, Anthony's been in government for many, many years.
2962720	2966720	He's a bureaucratic kind of a guy, a very great promoter.
2966720	2969720	I give him an A-plus as a promoter
2969720	2972720	and probably a C or a D as a doctor.
2972720	2975720	We now know from emails that have been released
2975720	2977720	under the Freedom of Information Act
2977720	2980720	that he was getting his advice
2980720	2985720	from the likes of Peter Dajik, a Wuhan collaborator.
2985720	2987720	At the same time, he was telling you
2987720	2989720	that this was a natural virus.
2989720	2992720	While at the same time, behind the scenes in emails,
2992720	2994720	he was having discussions
2994720	2997720	about whether this might have been genetically manipulated.
2997720	2999720	Does that shock you?
2999720	3001720	Well, he was dealing with them, certainly,
3001720	3004720	and my thing was a little bit different.
3004720	3006720	I just wanted to stop it.
3006720	3008720	Whether it developed one way or the other,
3008720	3010720	I just wanted to stop it.
3010720	3012720	But it's important to know where it came from.
3012720	3015720	It's extremely important to know how it developed.
3015720	3017720	Fauci was dealing with them,
3017720	3019720	and I guess they were even making payments
3019720	3021720	for certain kinds of research.
3021720	3023720	And I ended that, too. I stopped that.
3023720	3025720	When we found out about that,
3025720	3027720	he was doing that during the Obama years.
3027720	3029720	And when I found out about it, I said,
3029720	3031720	can you imagine that the United States
3031720	3034720	is making payments to a Chinese lab?
3034720	3036720	So just that on his face didn't make sense,
3036720	3038720	but I stopped that.
3038720	3041720	The Obama administration did hit pause
3041720	3043720	on gain-of-function research, though,
3043720	3046720	and that was lifted under your watch.
3046720	3049720	Why did you allow the gain-of-function research
3049720	3051720	to continue?
3051720	3053720	Well, I think probably people that worked for me
3053720	3055720	looked at it, and at one point
3055720	3057720	they might have done that,
3057720	3059720	but ultimately what we did was we shut it off.
3059720	3061720	We shut the whole thing off,
3061720	3063720	and we stopped making payments that were approved
3063720	3066720	much earlier than our administration.
3066720	3069720	Do you regret now not playing closer attention?
3069720	3072720	I mean, this gain-of-function research is extremely risky.
3072720	3074720	You know, banned under the Obama administration,
3074720	3078720	and then kick-started in 2017 under your watch.
3078720	3081720	Yeah, no, I think we've done an incredible job
3081720	3083720	between the vaccine and between
3083720	3085720	all of the Operation Warp Speed.
3085720	3087720	I think we did a great job,
3087720	3090720	and people are now starting to see what a great job we did.
3098720	3100720	While writing my book,
3100720	3104720	I discovered a crucial piece of the COVID-19 puzzle.
3104720	3107720	Cybersecurity analysts at Internet 2.0
3107720	3110720	recovered Chinese government data
3110720	3113720	that had been virtually wiped from the web.
3113720	3117720	It showed there was a buy-up of PCR equipment
3117720	3120720	used to test for coronaviruses
3120720	3124720	in Wuhan in 2019.
3124720	3126720	The next month,
3126720	3130720	one of those machines went to the Wuhan Institute.
3133720	3135720	Is this something you're aware of
3135720	3139720	that they bought a PCR machine in November 2019?
3139720	3142720	I wouldn't be able to comment on that.
3142720	3145720	How significant would this purchase be?
3145720	3147720	Would be significant.
3147720	3150720	Is it a smoking gun?
3150720	3152720	Ultimately, I don't think
3152720	3155720	there's ever going to be one specific smoking gun.
3155720	3158720	I think there's more than just smoke here.
3158720	3161720	I think there's fire from a whole bunch of different sources.
3161720	3164720	I think that would be another compelling piece of evidence.
3164720	3167720	If you need more, I don't need more.
3176720	3179720	Mr. President, I just want to ask you about this idea
3179720	3182720	that the Wuhan Institute of Virology
3182720	3185720	has strong ties to the Chinese military
3185720	3189720	and was working on secret projects with the Chinese military.
3189720	3194720	Do you think SARS-CoV-2 was developed as a bio-weapon?
3194720	3198720	So I'd like to think it wasn't,
3198720	3200720	and I'll probably have to leave it at that
3200720	3203720	because I want to give the benefit of a doubt,
3203720	3205720	and China was also affected by it.
3205720	3207720	So I really don't think it was,
3207720	3209720	but nobody can really know for sure,
3209720	3212720	and certainly now most of that evidence is gone,
3212720	3215720	and it's going to be very hard to find out.
3216720	3219720	That evidence was the viral database
3219720	3222720	which was taken offline by the Institute.
3222720	3225720	There's also early samples that were destroyed
3225720	3228720	and the people who disappeared.
3228720	3230720	But what is very evident
3230720	3235720	is the lab's close ties to the Chinese military.
3235720	3238720	It's definitely possible that the Chinese
3238720	3240720	have been working on a bio-weapon.
3240720	3242720	Their labs affiliated with the PLA
3242720	3246720	have been working on coronaviruses as either a bio-weapon
3246720	3249720	or as a defense against a potential bio-weapon.
3249720	3253720	And they've published papers in China
3253720	3255720	about both aspects, saying that,
3255720	3257720	oh, we can weaponize coronaviruses.
3257720	3260720	That actually would make a good bio-weapon.
3260720	3262720	And also they published papers and said
3262720	3267720	we have to be prepared for potential released bio-weapon.
3267720	3270720	Whether this precise virus is the result
3270720	3272720	of a bio-weapons program,
3272720	3276720	I highly doubt it, but I could not rule it out.
3276720	3280720	Nor is David Asher ruling it out.
3281720	3284720	In fact, the former COVID-19 investigator
3284720	3287720	believes something went badly wrong
3287720	3290720	inside the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
3293720	3296720	My concern was that the Chinese were doing research
3296720	3300720	in, as we learned later, quite uncontrolled circumstances
3300720	3302720	that was most definitely related
3302720	3305720	to biological warfare ambitions in the future,
3305720	3308720	and that they had had an accident of a secretive program
3308720	3311720	that they'd never wanted anyone to know about
3311720	3313720	because it was a weapon.
3313720	3316720	And the weapon had gotten released erroneously.
3316720	3318720	I mean, it was like someone dropping a nuclear weapon
3318720	3322720	at the back of a B-52 and bombing some city
3322720	3325720	and saying, whoops, we didn't mean for that to occur.
3327720	3332720	Do you think this was an accidental
3332720	3336720	or deliberate release of COVID-19 from China?
3336720	3339720	So I think it was probably an accident.
3339720	3342720	I don't think it was on purpose.
3342720	3344720	If it was, that's essentially war.
3344720	3346720	I don't think it was on purpose.
3346720	3348720	I think it was incompetence.
3348720	3351720	Scientists walked out and had lunch outside
3351720	3354720	in a park or something with the girlfriend,
3354720	3356720	and he had it and she had it.
3356720	3359720	Was that patient zero, that scientist from the lab?
3359720	3363720	I don't know if it's patient zero or patient something else,
3363720	3365720	but that's one theory.
3365720	3367720	Do you know how he was infected?
3367720	3371720	I think that it was incompetence.
3371720	3377720	I think that it escaped from the lab through incompetence,
3377720	3379720	and they've also had some safety problems,
3379720	3381720	as you know, at that lab.
3381720	3384720	The United States spoken to defectors who worked in the lab,
3384720	3386720	who blew the whistle on what happened.
3386720	3388720	I really can't talk about that.
3388720	3390720	Yeah, I cannot talk about that.
3390720	3392720	I won't be really allowed to talk.
3392720	3394720	I know what I want to.
3396720	3401720	Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged
3401720	3405720	or found a time more challenging or difficult
3405720	3407720	than the time we're in now.
3407720	3411720	Once in a century virus, it silently stalks the country.
3416720	3419720	Almost four months after becoming president,
3419720	3424720	Joe Biden ordered a probe into the origins of COVID-19,
3424720	3427720	the results inconclusive.
3427720	3431720	The report found two causes plausible.
3431720	3436720	Either it came from a lab or an infected animal.
3437720	3448720	Is there still major intelligence that goes to proving
3448720	3451720	the virus came out of the Wuhan Institute of Virology
3451720	3454720	that's still not in the public domain?
3454720	3456720	Yes, there's compelling intelligence
3456720	3458720	that hasn't been declassified.
3458720	3460720	When you declassify intelligence,
3460720	3465720	you risk the potential human sources or signals intelligence,
3465720	3470720	where your eyes and ears into their actions are coming from.
3470720	3475720	We put out as much as we felt we could safely do at the time,
3475720	3478720	but I think the time has come for the Biden administration
3478720	3480720	to declassify additional information
3480720	3485720	that would again, more evidence if you need it,
3485720	3489720	that Chinese Communist Party officials acted badly,
3489720	3494720	bullied international officials, covered up intelligence
3494720	3496720	and reporting on this.
3496720	3498720	There is more intelligence out there,
3498720	3500720	and I'd like to see it declassified
3500720	3502720	because it'll create additional pressure,
3502720	3504720	not just on Chinese Communist Party officials,
3504720	3506720	but others that still continue to deny
3506720	3508720	that China is a bad actor here.
3508720	3523720	We had an opportunity in January 2020
3523720	3528720	to eradicate this virus out of the whole human population,
3528720	3532720	and that's really sad because, you know,
3532720	3535720	in 50 years' time, our children's children,
3535720	3537720	you know, might one day look back and say,
3537720	3539720	why didn't anyone stop this virus
3539720	3543720	when you had the opportunity in that first few weeks?
3554720	3556720	From his lab in Australia,
3556720	3559720	Nikolai Petrovsky is developing a vaccine
3559720	3562720	that's in phase three clinical trials,
3562720	3567720	but he fears that COVID-19 may become a way of life.
3570720	3572720	So viruses are opportunist.
3572720	3576720	They find themselves in this wonderful new host
3576720	3578720	of which there's billions,
3578720	3580720	and it's learning as it goes.
3580720	3583720	It started as an exquisite human pathogen.
3583720	3587720	If we look now at strains like the Delta strain,
3587720	3590720	you know, it's going from bad to worse.
3590720	3592720	I mean, and this is what happens
3592720	3595720	when you have something that is already
3595720	3597720	the perfect human pathogen.
3597720	3599720	It won't stop there
3599720	3604720	because it's already, you know, has its foot in the door,
3604720	3606720	and it can only get better over time,
3606720	3608720	and that's what we're seeing,
3608720	3611720	and that's why, you know, it's been so scary.
3611720	3613720	Is this what the future looks like?
3613720	3617720	If this virus is allowed to spread and disseminate,
3617720	3619720	it's going to learn more tricks.
3619720	3621720	It's going to become more infectious
3621720	3624720	because that's the way viruses travel.
3624720	3626720	They're opportunist.
3626720	3628720	And it's going to reach a point
3628720	3631720	where we'll never actually free ourselves
3631720	3634720	because it's found with such a wonderful host species
3634720	3636720	it doesn't ever want to leave.
3637720	3641720	How do you think this global pandemic,
3641720	3644720	this crisis of a potential laboratory leak
3644720	3647720	could impact on Chinese leadership?
3650720	3655720	Well, my view is that the implications of this
3655720	3657720	for the PRC leadership
3657720	3659720	are severe.
3659720	3661720	I think it's a great opportunity
3661720	3664720	because the implications of this
3664720	3668720	for the PRC leadership are severe.
3668720	3671720	There will be factions
3671720	3674720	who are hugely dissatisfied
3674720	3676720	with what has happened,
3676720	3680720	with the way that Chinese reputation is damaged,
3680720	3683720	the way that, you know, China now becomes
3683720	3686720	something akin to an international pariah.
3686720	3689720	So I think the consequences of this
3689720	3692720	will be severe politically in China.
3692720	3695720	Over the next four or five years, watch this space.
3695720	3698720	Something will give, something will happen.
3698720	3700720	And I wouldn't be a tall surprise
3700720	3702720	if it brings Xi Jinping down,
3702720	3705720	or at least there isn't a contest
3705720	3708720	around his concept of leadership.
3719720	3722720	And as for two of the most senior members
3722720	3724720	of the Trump administration,
3724720	3729720	they are in no doubt about what really happened in Wuhan.
3732720	3735720	Well, listen, the people that had the most access
3735720	3737720	to the most intelligence are telling you
3737720	3740720	that the most likely origin of COVID-19,
3740720	3742720	of the Wuhan virus, was what happened,
3742720	3745720	was a lab leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
3745720	3747720	This is really most likely
3747720	3751720	what happened, and it's more than just a possibility.
3751720	3753720	It's certainly a probability,
3753720	3755720	and it's probably a certainty.
3757720	3759720	The other thing that the cover up tells you
3759720	3762720	is the absolute absence of humanity of these leaders.
3762720	3764720	They are willing to allow people to die.
3764720	3766720	They don't care about human life.
3766720	3768720	They don't value them the way the people in the West
3768720	3770720	in the United States and Australia do.
3770720	3774720	They are prepared to let millions of people die
3774720	3776720	if that's what it takes to protect their regime.
