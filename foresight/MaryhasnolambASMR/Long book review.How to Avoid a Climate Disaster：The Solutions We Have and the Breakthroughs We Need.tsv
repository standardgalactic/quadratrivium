0	14000	Hello everyone! I'm going to present you a book, a very interesting book, written by Bill Gates.
14000	24000	I think we all know who Bill Gates is and what he does.
24000	33000	But this book is very interesting because it talks about the climate change.
33000	47000	But in a very interesting way, I know that climate change can be quite a cliché.
47000	63000	Almost like everybody is saying that they are bored with this theme that everyone is talking about climate change.
63000	71000	It's almost like a cliché and it shouldn't be.
71000	79000	So I have found this book to be quite useful and quite...
79000	84000	In a way it's good, it's a good book, but in the same way it's a scary book.
84000	97000	Because if you are reading about all of the consequences of the things that we are doing now,
97000	103000	it's not such a great book to read because it will scare you actually.
103000	117000	So the complete title of the book is How to avoid a climate disaster, the solutions we have and the breakthroughs we need.
117000	123000	So Bill Gates has studied this issue for quite a long time.
123000	134000	I must tell you that just to give you an idea, let me see...
134000	144000	So almost like three quarters of the book are with the issues that we are having
144000	149000	and only a small tiny part of the book is about the solutions.
149000	164000	I wish Bill would have spent a bit more time in doing the positive part of the book, the solutions part of the book.
164000	174000	So yeah...
174000	179000	51 billion is the number that you should know.
179000	188000	It's about tons of gas that we are having on this planet.
188000	193000	The gases that have a greenhouse effect.
193000	196000	And zero would be the target.
196000	204000	So from 51 billion to zero, that's quite a lot.
204000	223000	And basically the goal of Bill Gates in this book is to tell us how we are going to get there basically.
223000	231000	So I think that it's achievable, definitely it's achievable.
231000	237000	But in the same time, I think that it's quite costly.
237000	245000	This is the truth because Bill says that in order to get there we should electrify everything.
245000	259000	Like give up on the things that make us go to fossil fuel, to things that pollute and electrify everything.
259000	267000	Instead of using your normal car, you should use an electric car.
267000	274000	But we all know that it's not an activity that is greatly incentivized by the government
274000	279000	because the electric cars are quite expensive still for a lot of people.
279000	291000	And not only that, they are not ideal for long distances, to be honest.
291000	299000	So Bill says a truth about this climate change.
299000	305000	And that truth is that the richest countries are guilty for this.
305000	313000	And the poor countries, the poor people, they unfortunately suffer the consequences.
313000	328000	So we have to fix something that the rich people or the people that can afford to have conspicuous consumption of things
328000	334000	in order to prevent the poor people to get the shorter end of the stick.
334000	342000	So yeah, I have found this to be a bit unfair actually.
342000	352000	The book is filled with a lot of technical details.
352000	363000	So Bill tells us why it should be zero and not another number and this should be achieved by the end of 2015.
364000	373000	So there are a lot of diagrams and a lot of charts.
373000	389000	And the sad thing about this carbon dioxide that's being released into the atmosphere is that it's not going away very easily.
389000	402000	So one-fifth of the carbon dioxide that we have released today, it will be still beer another 10,000 years.
402000	417000	So it's not very easy to erase the consequences of our less nature-friendly activities.
417000	423000	So Bill portrays a future.
423000	428000	How will the future be if we do not take actions?
428000	432000	And we can see glimpses of this future.
432000	438000	He says that we will have more days with extreme temperatures.
438000	444000	We will have much more storms, very violent storms.
444000	454000	He talks about the Hurricane Maria in 2017 that has left Puerto Rico devastated.
454000	462000	And not only that, the damages that it has done, it has put Puerto Rico 20 years behind.
462000	471000	So yes, a natural disaster, like it devastates everything and leaves nothing behind.
471000	477000	So it can push you back a lot.
477000	490000	So imagine like you see this all the time with a lot of hurricanes, with a lot of issues basically.
490000	496000	So it's not very good. It's not very good at all.
496000	502000	We will have much more fires in the woods.
502000	509000	And if the temperature will rise even with two degrees, the coral reefs might disappear.
509000	523000	And that will trigger a chain reaction in the sense that it will destroy a major income source for the fishermen.
523000	534000	And for those who have made a living by providing service with fishing.
534000	546000	So it's all in a chain. So this book made me really understand the fact that everything that we are doing is triggering a chain reaction.
546000	555000	So you can say, okay, it's not a big deal that I have a car and my car runs on gas. I'm just one person.
555000	564000	But the problem with this is that each of the billions of people, if they think like this, nobody's doing anything.
564000	573000	So it's all things that add up.
573000	582000	Bill mentions Syria and the drought that happened between 2007 and 2010.
582000	595000	1.5 million people have abandoned the areas, the rural areas where they used to do agriculture in favor of towns.
595000	606000	And by 2018, 13 millions, 13 millions of people had to just walk away.
606000	613000	Yeah, just imagine that suddenly the area that you are living is becoming like a desert.
613000	627000	And if you used to like grow vegetables and have animals, and that suddenly is no longer an option, you will just have to relocate and go in another place.
627000	635000	That's not very easy to do.
635000	639000	So now let's talk about petrol.
639000	644000	About petrol and I found some very interesting details about petrol.
644000	656000	On a global scale, we are using 15 billion, 15 billion liters of petrol every day.
656000	663000	The petrol is cheaper than the cheapest soda, like a refresher.
663000	668000	And I was blown away and Bill made some calculations.
668000	680000	And the gas price, for example, in 2020 came on 26 cents per liter.
680000	685000	I think he has done his calculations for USA, obviously.
685000	691000	And the soda, the cheapest soda is 75 cents per liter.
691000	697000	So imagine like petrol is really cheap, gas is really, really cheap.
697000	712000	And this is why it's such an issue to convince anyone basically to choose the eco-friendly alternative
712000	719000	because of the taxes and because of the Green Premium Edition.
719000	724000	You pay extra if you want to eco-friendly.
724000	733000	And you have noticed that everything that has that little label, you always pay extra.
733000	745000	It's just because for the moment, it hasn't been found a solution to cut down the cost of producing something more green, more eco.
745000	757000	And the issue is that until any type of technology gets adopted, it takes time.
757000	760000	So Bill Gates says that.
760000	763000	And we have noticed this throughout the history.
763000	770000	Remember how long it took until all people had a computer in their homes?
770000	772000	It took years.
772000	776000	How many years did it take until every family had a car?
776000	778000	It took years.
778000	785000	So adopting a new technology means maybe decades, decades.
785000	788000	It's the same with green energy.
788000	808000	The only issue that we have is the fact that by the time all of us will be able to adopt it, the climate will maybe be severely damaged.
808000	818000	So Bill starts to talk about the main industries and the main areas of our lives that cause the most pollution.
818000	824000	And he starts with the fossil fuel and the coal industry.
824000	840000	So because of the pollution caused by coal exploitation, there are more people dying because of this because in comparison with all of the nuclear incidents.
840000	852000	I know that when nuclear is spelled in a sentence, it automatically triggers a lot of mixed emotions because
852000	869000	I must tell you that I was amazed to find out that using nuclear energy is the only type of energy that is green like it does not cause any release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
869000	876000	So it's the greenest of the alternatives, the nuclear energy.
876000	885000	And because of the incidents that happened, let's just mention like the Chernobyl, people are very, very reluctant.
885000	900000	You know, like I'm pretty sure if someone would come and knock on your door and tell you, hey, we are planning to build a nuclear power plant in here.
900000	918000	I bet people would almost entirely say no because there's a lot of fright and a lot of prejudice, you know, because people do not know these facts, basically.
919000	926000	So let's name the guilty ones.
926000	940000	Bell makes a list with the main five guilty industries that are contributing to the overall pollution and climate change.
940000	944000	It's about the production process, basically.
944000	961000	It's about concrete, steel, plastic, and 31% out of the greenhouse effect gases are being produced because of this process.
961000	974000	So all of the buildings that need these materials, these three basic materials, they are responsible for the pollution that is happening.
974000	1003000	Another responsible is connecting at the electricity network, 27% of the gases, agriculture, 19%, and I'll make a small little note, stop eating burgers.
1003000	1028000	I was blown away to find out that in order to produce the meat and the burgers, you need a lot of land, and not only that, but the cows are responsible for these gases because they also release a methane in the air because of the...
1028000	1030000	Flatulence!
1030000	1050000	I was like, even Bell was so funny when he specified this, that it doesn't look like a very serious deal to say that the flatulence of the cows that help you eat the burgers are affecting the planet, but it's actually very true.
1051000	1069000	Yeah, transportation, going from A to B, 16%, and maintaining hot or cool air or heating or cooling your house, it's 7%.
1069000	1074000	So these are the main responsibles.
1075000	1093000	In Switzerland, we have a sort of a machine CDA that is supposed to absorb the CO2 from the atmosphere, so it's basically like a big vacuum that could just absorb everything from our air and purify it.
1094000	1107000	But check this out, it would cost 5.1 trillions of dollars every year in order to solve the problem.
1107000	1122000	Okay, this sounds very unlikely for me to happen. I don't think that any government would be willing to spend so much money to clean up the air.
1123000	1144000	Bell talks about the poor areas on our planet, especially about the sub-Saharan Africa, where 600 million people do not have access to electricity.
1144000	1164000	So this is the irony of this planet, I would say, that the poor people are going to be the most affected by what the rich people are doing.
1164000	1184000	So Bell is an example about agriculture, for example, like a farmer from Switzerland or from USA is much better equipped to deal with the consequences of bad climate on his crops than a farmer in Africa.
1184000	1200000	A lot of farmers in Africa are already struggling to make a living from agriculture, so if the weather goes bad and their crops are being banished, they're done.
1201000	1226000	So I have found this to be very ironic and very sad and just like, almost like cynical that as our salaries grow and as the just well-being level grows throughout Europe and USA,
1226000	1238000	people can afford more, so people spend more, so people get an extra car, they get air conditioners, they get a lot of stuff, and that just raises the level of pollution.
1239000	1258000	And unfortunately, the poor people in Africa and other underdeveloped areas, they will suffer more than those who have bought their air conditioners. It's quite sad, I think.
1259000	1286000	So the fossil fuels, they are giving us two thirds of all of the energy that we are generating. So the problem with fossil fuels is that they are very cheap, they give a lot of energy and it's very hard to convince the titans in the industry to say,
1286000	1305000	okay, I'm not going to use this resource and go to a 10x or 100x more expensive eco solution. So it's a vicious circle and very hard to solve, actually.
1306000	1326000	And the great issue with energy and its storage, how do you store? So let's assume that we are able to find green alternatives for energy, but how do we store it?
1326000	1345000	That's another issue. You would need huge batteries, it's unimaginable. So this is another issue of green energy because even if you would obtain it, how do you store it?
1345000	1370000	So it's like a loop, you know, it's a loop of issues. Bill mentions in 2021 a project called Express TransWest. It's a project about transmitting the energy generated by the wind in Wyoming and get that to California.
1370000	1389000	It will become operational in 2024. I haven't researched if it is operational. I'm really curious about that. And that's happening 17 years after starting it. So it takes time. So it takes a lot of time.
1390000	1410000	So the nuclear energy is the only source of energy without carbon emissions. So it can provide you with electricity day in and night out. So yeah, it's really good. I was amazed.
1410000	1431000	So Bill talks about the two processes in the nuclear energy that can be used to obtain energy. It's about using the energy when the atoms, they split or when they get united.
1431000	1445000	So the issue with those is that they can leave radioactive waste.
1446000	1464000	So even with nuclear energy, we have to think about, okay, what do we do with that radioactive waste? So I have discovered that there is no solution without a problem to solve afterwards.
1464000	1477000	So we have to find ways in which we can tackle the entire period of consequences for any solution, as green as it can sound.
1477000	1503000	So bringing the atoms together is better than and using that energy is better because the radioactive, the waste is radioactive only for a couple of hundred of years in comparison with the other method with the fusion where the waste can remain radioactive for a thousand of years.
1503000	1521000	That's a significant difference, I would say. The problem is that we need a lot of energy to start that reaction. So in order to start the reaction, now we need a lot of energy. That's the problem.
1521000	1544000	There's another project in France about this. So this project is supposed to start in 2030 and it's supposed to generate plasma and energy from its type of nuclear reaction.
1551000	1571000	There's also talks about the wind energy and the biggest user of wind turbines by using the coast wind is UK. I was amazed to find this out.
1571000	1597000	So this is pretty much it about the coal, about the steel. Oh, mentioning the steel. Producing one ton of steel makes 1.8 tons of CO2. That's a lot.
1597000	1618000	So all of the steel in the buildings, they came with a price. So let's move on to agriculture. So here, Bill mentions a very important person that has made quite a significant contribution to agriculture.
1618000	1641000	It's about Norman Borlaug that took the Nobel Prize in 1970. He has developed a different type of wheat with a shorter stem and with a bigger size.
1642000	1659000	And all of the wheat that is growing today in the world is derived from the plant developed by this engineer. So Norman did a huge service to humanity.
1659000	1686000	Another significant improvement in agriculture came with the development of the synthetic product that farmers use in order to nourish their crops.
1686000	1710000	So without that, a lot of people in really poor areas, they can't improve their soil otherwise. So developing this product, this synthetic product really helped a lot of people and Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch managed to do this process.
1717000	1736000	There are also talks about the forest. I was very sad to read this statistic that in the entire world we have lost more than 1.3 million square kilometers of forest from 1990s until now.
1736000	1754000	And it's really not beneficial for us because 1.3 can absorb 4 tons of CO2 in 40 years. So the trees basically absorb all of the toxic CO2 out of the atmosphere.
1754000	1775000	So when we are cutting and using them to burn or to burn them, we are doing double, double damage. We are extracting a plant, a product that can help us and we're also releasing CO2 while burning it.
1776000	1794000	So again, we go to another guilty factor, the transportation.
1795000	1811000	So there have been works done when it comes to using green energy for transportation, but for example in cases of playing, it's very unlikely to have that developed in the future.
1811000	1834000	Because the best, the best top notch electric plane that has been built, it can transport two people at a maximum speed of 340 kilometers per hour and it can fly only for three hours until it can be recharged.
1835000	1857000	So this is not a reliable plane that a big company would want to adopt because yeah, using kerosene and the classical fuels for planes, it's what gets people from A to B really, really fast and really, really cheap.
1857000	1869000	So we need technology and we need people with brilliant minds to find alternatives basically.
1869000	1877000	Yeah, this statistic again shocked me.
1877000	1883000	So the population on the planet is keep on rising.
1883000	1902000	So in order to provide shelter for people, we will need to add 232 billions of buildings until 2060.
1902000	1911000	That is the equivalent of building a New York every month for 40 years.
1911000	1930000	So I think that we also need to find alternative ways to develop buildings and places to live that would not require so much pay and so much fuel and so much concrete.
1930000	1951000	So again, I think innovation and there has and not only innovation, but we need to think the buildings in a different way, like much more green buildings, you know, and there is such a building bullet center in Seattle.
1951000	1960000	It's one of the greenest commercial buildings in the world, but it was very, very expensive to build.
1960000	1970000	We need a concept that is cheap, that is available, and that we can use from commercial to urban.
1970000	1997000	And again, I think challenge in a way I can understand while Bell is quite in a dilemma because the problems are so many and they are so all interconnected that the solutions will have to be very, very, I don't know, original and new and cheap.
1997000	2023000	That's the problem because people are not willing to spend a ton of money or pay for greener electricity like have their bill cost raise up to 100% or 200% just for the sake of the planet like people who live on day by day will be not motivated.
2023000	2039000	They will say okay, screw the planet like I don't have the money, a greener bill for my electricity gives me the cheap, polluting friendly alternatives because I can't afford it.
2039000	2061000	And this is another factor about the taxes, the extra taxes that you have to pay for these alternatives because they cost more and I can understand why people would not be willing to adopt it.
2061000	2071000	Yeah, the cost, I think the cost is the biggest issue.
2071000	2086000	So we go on the third, like, second, the third factor, the agriculture just a lot of talk about agriculture, it's quite a predominant subject in this book.
2086000	2103000	So there's a talk about the mangrove alternative because the mangrove can help stabilize the soil against flooding.
2103000	2114000	So when flooding happens, these mangroves are able to somehow be like a buffer front of this phenomenon.
2114000	2137000	And there's a new field emerging, geoengineering and this is about making temporary adjustments in the oceans or in the atmosphere in order to cool down the planet.
2137000	2152000	So Bill here said that a lot of people are against geoengineering because it looks like we are playing God and you're trying to really like change the planet.
2152000	2170000	But for me it makes sense because there was a story about somehow changing the way the clouds absorb and to make the clouds much more luminous in order to reflect sunlight and if you managed to do that for a couple of days or a couple of months,
2170000	2175000	you really have an impact and then you can stop.
2175000	2199000	But it makes sense because I think it would be maybe cheaper in comparison with trying to make the people adopt costly alternatives to what they are using for their daily lives like transportation, what they're eating.
2199000	2220000	Yeah, so I don't know, it's really like, I was wondering that like even if a very brilliant mind like the bell gate, like bell gates has, even if he is struggling with this issue, finding solutions and finding alternatives,
2221000	2239000	this gives me a depth of the problem and it's so complex because it doesn't come only from what we are eating or it doesn't come from where we are going and how often we are traveling.
2239000	2268000	They're all like interconnected, interweaved, so yeah, it's a very complicated issue so I can understand why it's so complicated, it has become almost like a cliche because I suppose that not a lot of people would go in depth and really try to find out what's this thing with the climate change, you know?
2268000	2295000	Yeah, there's a talk about Denmark, we all know that all of the Nordic countries are a bit ahead of everyone almost, but Denmark is producing half of its electricity supply from the wind, from the wind.
2295000	2305000	And it's the biggest exporter of wind turbines in the world.
2305000	2321000	Wow, I was like, of course, doing this, it does not apply to every country but not every country has this sort of geographical positioning so they could use the wind.
2322000	2349000	But those that do, it makes sense for them to invest in it and not only that but I think it makes sense because it's like you are obtaining a sort of freedom when it comes to electricity that is using natural resources that are there, you know?
2349000	2378000	But you only have to use them, you know, so I think what this book maybe doesn't have is maybe a list with all of the natural assets that every country or yeah, every country on the planet would have and it would make them like approach finding an energy supply.
2379000	2396000	In a wiser way, for example, okay, if you have a lot of sun, use it, if you have a lot of wind, use it, if you have a lot of water and use it, so yeah, I think it should be consensus, you know?
2396000	2420000	Have each country find alternatives for energy but find them from nature and from the natural resources they have been given, for example, UK is using like the winds, Denmark is using them, so yeah, I think this is still a new territory, I think.
2427000	2444000	So, there's a super story of a family in Kenya that grabbed my attention, let me just find it because I really liked it.
2445000	2466000	So, yeah, this is like the farmer and Bill talks that in 2009 he went to visit Miriam and Laban Palaam at the farm in Kabyet, Kenya.
2467000	2479000	So, they also have three children and the farmers are living in Kenya with less than one hectare of land.
2479000	2498000	So, what happened? Two years before being visited by Bill, they were small farmers that practiced a really basic agriculture just to make a living.
2499000	2504000	They were cultivating corn which is quite common and veggies.
2507000	2512000	They also had a cow that they milked two times per day.
2513000	2533000	In total, the cow would give them three liters of milk and that's quite little, three liters of milk for a family with five members, that's quite little.
2534000	2544000	So, after two years, like when Bill has met this family, their life was completely different, what has changed?
2544000	2559000	So, first of all, they had four cows, they were producing 26 liters of milk, they were selling 20 liters, they were keeping six liters for their own consumption.
2560000	2564000	So, they were winning four dollars a day.
2564000	2581000	So, in Kenya, with four dollars per day, they were able to rebuild some parts of the house, you know, to cultivate pineapple for export and also to be able to sustain their children in school.
2582000	2597000	So, what happened? It was a decisive moment where when a farm, a factory for cooling the milk was opened near their town where they live.
2597000	2620000	In that place, that factory, there were people that managed to educate farmers and tell them what they could use on their crops and what could they use for their cows to help the cow give more milk and to keep them healthy.
2620000	2625000	And this helped them a lot.
2626000	2641000	So, the average Kenyan is producing 55 less carbon dioxide than the average American.
2642000	2644000	Yeah.
2644000	2669000	So, the family in Kenya was saved by education, basically, because a lot of people that live there and they try to make a living, maybe they do not have access to the knowledge, like to better seeds, to better care for their cows, to just information.
2669000	2673000	And having that factory open, it helped them.
2673000	2687000	So, did the farmer raise his carbon print? Yes, but it's very insignificant in comparison with a farmer from Texas, for example.
2687000	2712000	So, I think that it's very important to specify that Bell says that it wouldn't be fair, and I agree, it wouldn't be fair to say, let's, like, if the people from the poorer area try to raise their head above water and just make a better living,
2712000	2717000	they will contribute to the pollution of the planet, so they should not advance.
2717000	2729000	But that's not fair, because it's like, why should they pay for, like, the consequences for the rich people that brought the planet into this point?
2729000	2748000	So, Bell says that we have to find alternatives for farmers and the people in the poorer areas to also level up their lifestyle, but without contributing so much to the climate change.
2748000	2767000	So, it's a very complicated issue, and let me just say, I think in chapter 11, Bell starts to offer us 10 solutions, or 10.
2767000	2778000	In chapter 10, it must be, yeah, in 10, no, in 11, yeah.
2778000	2788000	So, this is like the part with the solutions from the book, and this is like the part with the problems.
2788000	2793000	So, it's definitely not very encouraging.
2793000	2806000	Yeah, so Bell presents us his plan to reach zero, like, zero emissions, no?
2806000	2829000	And he says that it can be done, and he remembers his times when he had a dream with his friend Paul Allen, when founding Microsoft, to be able to let, like, have each person on the planet have a computer, you know?
2829000	2834000	So, it looked pretty wild, but now it's possible.
2834000	2849000	So, this makes Bell also think that, okay, we can also make this happen in the environment, you know?
2849000	2858000	We can also, like, yeah, make it happen somehow.
2858000	2862000	It looks like a fantasy until someone gets it done, you know?
2862000	2869000	Each dream, it looks like a fantasy until someone gets it done, you know?
2869000	2876000	Ah, yeah.
2876000	2897000	And he says that we need a lot of sciences to contribute to this, because we need a common effort, you know?
2897000	2911000	It's not enough to have one actor, you know, from one industry to take action.
2911000	2915000	We need a common effort, you know?
2915000	2919000	And this can only be done through collaboration.
2919000	2922000	It's not through pointing fingers, you know?
2922000	2924000	Agriculture is to blame.
2924000	2926000	Oh, no, the fossil fuels.
2926000	2932000	Oh, it's like, we are, like, the titans of all industries.
2932000	2946000	Just say, okay, we all contributed to this mess, but this mess was somehow necessary in order for the world to be as it is now, you know?
2946000	2960000	So we need a couple of sciences to collaborate and we need biology, we need chemistry, we need physics, we need political sciences, we need economy, we need engineering.
2960000	2969000	So we need a lot of specialists to just gather up and now think about it, you know?
2969000	2975000	Like, explore the depths of their minds and find out.
2976000	2983000	So he talks about offer and demand.
2983000	3001000	So he's trying to say that, for example, if you are going to choose to order a vegan burger instead of a classical burger, you will make a difference, because once you place that order, there is a demand.
3001000	3017000	And if more people are doing it, then, of course, the big, big players in the market will listen, because everything that's happening now, it's like, offer and demand.
3017000	3024000	Are people consuming more soda drinks and say, okay, we're going to create a product?
3025000	3032000	Are people, do people want green cars and stuff like that and there's demand?
3032000	3034000	Okay, we're going to produce that.
3034000	3051000	So this is what this book maybe is trying to do, to instill a sense of personal responsibility and contribution in the problem, because you cannot wash your hands and say,
3051000	3058000	I'm just one person in Europe and my habits do not make a difference.
3058000	3071000	Yes, they do, because it's the power of the compound, the power of the many individual choices.
3071000	3082000	So you pick it one day and you tell a friend or a sister or brother and maybe they will pick another thing and this adds up.
3082000	3085000	It's like the snowball effect.
3085000	3100000	So I think this is one thing that Bill tries to do in his book, to tell us that all of our individual choices will contribute to a change in the demand in the market.
3101000	3108000	Because the big, if people would come, let's put it this way.
3108000	3115000	If more people would come into a KFC and they would say, do you have a vegan option?
3115000	3119000	And this would happen a thousand times per day.
3119000	3127000	Probably the KFC management could say, okay, our crispy chicken is not so much in demand.
3127000	3129000	People want more vegan options.
3129000	3131000	Okay, we need to change.
3131000	3143000	And that will have an effect on the planet because they will need less chickens, you know, because people are no longer interested in chicken nuggets.
3143000	3148000	But if people are not trying to change their own habits, guess what?
3148000	3161000	The market will give them what they want because if you were to have a business and you want to make money, you are like the client is your master.
3161000	3169000	And the client will tell you what he wants and you will deliver because you want to make money.
3169000	3171000	And it makes sense.
3173000	3191000	I like that Bill does not point fingers in order to make people guilty because in our industry, even the biggest burger chain, they are providing to people what they want.
3192000	3210000	So maybe I'm thinking that in a similar situation like with the farmer in Kenya, people need education, people need to be told, hey, do you know that there's separate alternatives to the classical burgers?
3210000	3212000	You could have this and that.
3213000	3230000	The problem in perspective in the sense that you want your children to need healthier air, you want your grandchildren to live on a good planet, you know, because we will be gone by natural causes.
3230000	3234000	People get born and they die every day.
3234000	3238000	But the planet, we are stuck here for the moment.
3239000	3247000	So for the next 100 or 500 years, I do not see people colonizing different planets.
3247000	3250000	Like this is what we've got.
3250000	3254000	And yeah, we need education.
3256000	3257000	Yeah.
3257000	3261000	And we need also innovation.
3261000	3266000	And I would dare to say that we need scientists.
3266000	3278000	We need people like Einstein and people like Max Planck and people like Tesla to invent new things, you know.
3278000	3288000	So Bill makes a list with the necessary technologies that we need.
3288000	3294000	We need zero carbon concrete steel.
3294000	3304000	We need based on plants and on cells, you know, you can create in the lab.
3304000	3308000	We need to find a way to store energy.
3308000	3311000	We need a geothermal energy.
3311000	3317000	We need a subterranean transmission of electricity.
3317000	3327000	There was one great idea that I liked about finding a way to transmit electricity, you know, the excess of electricity underground.
3327000	3334000	But the problem is that you have to find cables that do not overheat much.
3334000	3344000	Because electricity, like, go like, do not touch but cables through which electricity is transmitted, they can get pretty hot.
3344000	3365000	So trying to send a lot of electricity underground without any system to ventilate that underground, obviously, is another issue that has to be solved by brilliant scientists, I would say.
3365000	3374000	Yeah, we also need electrophiles, electrophiles, we need biofuels.
3374000	3385000	We need nuclear energy, but we need to find ways in which to make it safe.
3385000	3394000	We need the government to increase the budget for research and developing clear energy.
3394000	3401000	And Bill's makes a comparison of the budget that the government gave for health.
3401000	3409000	And the National Institute for Health, it has, it had a budget of 36 billions of dollars.
3409000	3419000	But for research, the budget is only seven billions of dollars.
3419000	3437000	But Bill states, and I can see his logic, that the investment, the bigger investment in research would pay, would pay itself off dividends because of the compound effects it will have on the climate.
3437000	3456000	So you invest more in research now, but you will reap the benefits decades and hundreds of years later.
3456000	3473000	Bill also says, again, for the government, that it would be a good idea to invest in a project of research and developing with higher risk and great results.
3473000	3480000	And he gives an example of the human genome project.
3480000	3499000	And it was a very high risk project, but it paid off dividends because for each dollar that government invested, it was an earning of $141 was reaped for the economy of the United States.
3499000	3504000	So, yeah.
3504000	3512000	A solution is also to accelerate the demands for innovations.
3512000	3523000	To have stimulants that can reduce the risks and costs.
3523000	3529000	To have a price for the carbon.
3529000	3539000	And he says that people should pay extra if they choose the options that are increasing their food carbon print.
3539000	3545000	So if I have an alternative to go green and I don't, I will pay extra.
3545000	3546000	And it makes sense.
3546000	3550000	For example, look at air conditioning units.
3550000	3559000	You know, there is that there are those labels that tell you it's a plus plus it's a plus it's B it's C.
3559000	3566000	So you might get a cheaper air conditioning unit at the beginning.
3566000	3578000	But on the long term, that will be very costly for you because energetically like it's inefficient and it's consumption, it's preposterous, you know.
3578000	3584000	On the contrary, if you invest in a more expensive air conditioning unit.
3584000	3588000	And it has like better energy consumption.
3588000	3607000	You will reap the benefits months and years after, like because your electricity bill will be lighter because that is better thought in terms of consumption, you know.
3607000	3612000	They'll also say that we should have a standard.
3612000	3614000	So here is the complicated thing.
3614000	3623000	In order to develop a worldwide standard, you have to put nations to agree.
3623000	3633000	Having so many nations, so many different interests, you know, to agree on a standard.
3633000	3635000	That's the challenge.
3635000	3639000	That's a challenge.
3639000	3645000	No, he also says that we should throw away the old stuff like.
3645000	3665000	And including like factory and places where they are trying to energy, but they're very inefficient and bill is going through the tear down and rebuild again approach.
3665000	3681000	But I can understand why this can be again, something that not a lot of people would agree with because they would, they have like the sunk cost fallacy in the sense that oh, we have invested so much into building this.
3681000	3687000	I know power plant and how can we like carry down and build another one like Wow.
3687000	3697000	But again, sometimes it's good to let go of the things that are not efficient anymore.
3697000	3708000	Think of the, for example, as a comparison, the old vintage cars, the old vintage cars that some people keep and actually drive.
3708000	3713000	But those cars are like punges for gas.
3713000	3719000	They, they have a crazy consumption of gas.
3719000	3726000	Like it's not, it's not smart to continue to drive them.
3726000	3727000	It's just ludicrous.
3727000	3735000	Like you can keep them for beauty, but driving that it would make your pockets stink.
3736000	3745000	Like, and take this analogy with the energy exploitation and the factories or maybe the plants.
3745000	3752000	Again, it doesn't make sense to them running if they are just making money.
3752000	3753000	No.
3757000	3762000	Let's talk about the government, about the authority.
3762000	3771000	And in chapter 12 Bill says, how can we each of us contribute as a citizen?
3771000	3789000	And they suggest that we should be much more active in the political scene in the sense that we should see who is responsible for clean energy in our city to get in contact with them.
3789000	3796000	Yeah.
3796000	3807000	And he also has some talks about the politics.
3807000	3808000	Yeah.
3809000	3819000	So there's a lot of talk about the politics and the governments and their impact on this problem.
3819000	3838000	And, yeah, it makes it makes a lot of sense because for any law to approve, it has to go through the process of the bureaucratic process of being adopted.
3838000	3857000	So I liked this book, but I admit that I would have liked for it to have a thicker part of the solutions because the problems God knows there are so many.
3858000	3875000	And I, my intuition tells me that we need some really good, good scientists to put their minds together and find solutions.
3875000	3892000	You know, so I understand it makes sense to delegate more money and more resources to research, you know, that kind of activity that maybe a lot of citizens find boring or unnecessary.
3892000	3919000	But let's take a minute to go back in history and realize that everything that we normal common people enjoy has happened because bad scientists, someone who has studied and did a lot of research was able to find an idea like the light bulb, the electricity, the wheat, the, you know,
3919000	3940000	we need to support the people and allocate funds for them in order to get better alternatives, you know, investing in education and innovation is really, really important.
3940000	3951000	Well, these invisible people that nobody sees because they are with their heads in the box and studying and doing experiments.
3951000	3960000	These are the people that put our money and our bets on because they will manage to find a solution.
3961000	3962000	Yeah.
3962000	3966000	So this is it about this book.
3966000	3976000	I think it's a necessary reading, because we have to think a bit further than our immediate horizon.
3977000	3992000	And I think we have all seen at least, I don't know for you, but for me at least in the last five years, you could see in your country that change of seasons is not the same.
3992000	3995000	The winters are not the same anymore.
3995000	4019000	The autumns like everything is shifting and it's definitely warmer and you have temperatures in January and February that are like shocking, you know, because 20 years ago, in Europe, at least in February, it will be very cold in winter, but now it's like springtime.
4020000	4041000	So for us that are a bit older, we can see those things happening, you know, children and teachers now, maybe they haven't gone through so many seasons, but those who have been living for quite a while, they can get the difference.
4041000	4052000	And it's pretty scary to realize that this whole climate change is very much real.
4052000	4053000	Okay.
4053000	4062000	Thank you very much for listening to me and I'll see you next time for the next book review.
4062000	4063000	Bye bye.
