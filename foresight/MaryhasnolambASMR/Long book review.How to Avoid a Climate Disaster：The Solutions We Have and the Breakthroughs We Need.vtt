00:00.000 --> 00:14.000
Hello everyone! I'm going to present you a book, a very interesting book, written by Bill Gates.

00:14.000 --> 00:24.000
I think we all know who Bill Gates is and what he does.

00:24.000 --> 00:33.000
But this book is very interesting because it talks about the climate change.

00:33.000 --> 00:47.000
But in a very interesting way, I know that climate change can be quite a cliché.

00:47.000 --> 01:03.000
Almost like everybody is saying that they are bored with this theme that everyone is talking about climate change.

01:03.000 --> 01:11.000
It's almost like a cliché and it shouldn't be.

01:11.000 --> 01:19.000
So I have found this book to be quite useful and quite...

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
In a way it's good, it's a good book, but in the same way it's a scary book.

01:24.000 --> 01:37.000
Because if you are reading about all of the consequences of the things that we are doing now,

01:37.000 --> 01:43.000
it's not such a great book to read because it will scare you actually.

01:43.000 --> 01:57.000
So the complete title of the book is How to avoid a climate disaster, the solutions we have and the breakthroughs we need.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.000
So Bill Gates has studied this issue for quite a long time.

02:03.000 --> 02:14.000
I must tell you that just to give you an idea, let me see...

02:14.000 --> 02:24.000
So almost like three quarters of the book are with the issues that we are having

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000
and only a small tiny part of the book is about the solutions.

02:29.000 --> 02:44.000
I wish Bill would have spent a bit more time in doing the positive part of the book, the solutions part of the book.

02:44.000 --> 02:54.000
So yeah...

02:54.000 --> 02:59.000
51 billion is the number that you should know.

02:59.000 --> 03:08.000
It's about tons of gas that we are having on this planet.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
The gases that have a greenhouse effect.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
And zero would be the target.

03:16.000 --> 03:24.000
So from 51 billion to zero, that's quite a lot.

03:24.000 --> 03:43.000
And basically the goal of Bill Gates in this book is to tell us how we are going to get there basically.

03:43.000 --> 03:51.000
So I think that it's achievable, definitely it's achievable.

03:51.000 --> 03:57.000
But in the same time, I think that it's quite costly.

03:57.000 --> 04:05.000
This is the truth because Bill says that in order to get there we should electrify everything.

04:05.000 --> 04:19.000
Like give up on the things that make us go to fossil fuel, to things that pollute and electrify everything.

04:19.000 --> 04:27.000
Instead of using your normal car, you should use an electric car.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.000
But we all know that it's not an activity that is greatly incentivized by the government

04:34.000 --> 04:39.000
because the electric cars are quite expensive still for a lot of people.

04:39.000 --> 04:51.000
And not only that, they are not ideal for long distances, to be honest.

04:51.000 --> 04:59.000
So Bill says a truth about this climate change.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.000
And that truth is that the richest countries are guilty for this.

05:05.000 --> 05:13.000
And the poor countries, the poor people, they unfortunately suffer the consequences.

05:13.000 --> 05:28.000
So we have to fix something that the rich people or the people that can afford to have conspicuous consumption of things

05:28.000 --> 05:34.000
in order to prevent the poor people to get the shorter end of the stick.

05:34.000 --> 05:42.000
So yeah, I have found this to be a bit unfair actually.

05:42.000 --> 05:52.000
The book is filled with a lot of technical details.

05:52.000 --> 06:03.000
So Bill tells us why it should be zero and not another number and this should be achieved by the end of 2015.

06:04.000 --> 06:13.000
So there are a lot of diagrams and a lot of charts.

06:13.000 --> 06:29.000
And the sad thing about this carbon dioxide that's being released into the atmosphere is that it's not going away very easily.

06:29.000 --> 06:42.000
So one-fifth of the carbon dioxide that we have released today, it will be still beer another 10,000 years.

06:42.000 --> 06:57.000
So it's not very easy to erase the consequences of our less nature-friendly activities.

06:57.000 --> 07:03.000
So Bill portrays a future.

07:03.000 --> 07:08.000
How will the future be if we do not take actions?

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And we can see glimpses of this future.

07:12.000 --> 07:18.000
He says that we will have more days with extreme temperatures.

07:18.000 --> 07:24.000
We will have much more storms, very violent storms.

07:24.000 --> 07:34.000
He talks about the Hurricane Maria in 2017 that has left Puerto Rico devastated.

07:34.000 --> 07:42.000
And not only that, the damages that it has done, it has put Puerto Rico 20 years behind.

07:42.000 --> 07:51.000
So yes, a natural disaster, like it devastates everything and leaves nothing behind.

07:51.000 --> 07:57.000
So it can push you back a lot.

07:57.000 --> 08:10.000
So imagine like you see this all the time with a lot of hurricanes, with a lot of issues basically.

08:10.000 --> 08:16.000
So it's not very good. It's not very good at all.

08:16.000 --> 08:22.000
We will have much more fires in the woods.

08:22.000 --> 08:29.000
And if the temperature will rise even with two degrees, the coral reefs might disappear.

08:29.000 --> 08:43.000
And that will trigger a chain reaction in the sense that it will destroy a major income source for the fishermen.

08:43.000 --> 08:54.000
And for those who have made a living by providing service with fishing.

08:54.000 --> 09:06.000
So it's all in a chain. So this book made me really understand the fact that everything that we are doing is triggering a chain reaction.

09:06.000 --> 09:15.000
So you can say, okay, it's not a big deal that I have a car and my car runs on gas. I'm just one person.

09:15.000 --> 09:24.000
But the problem with this is that each of the billions of people, if they think like this, nobody's doing anything.

09:24.000 --> 09:33.000
So it's all things that add up.

09:33.000 --> 09:42.000
Bill mentions Syria and the drought that happened between 2007 and 2010.

09:42.000 --> 09:55.000
1.5 million people have abandoned the areas, the rural areas where they used to do agriculture in favor of towns.

09:55.000 --> 10:06.000
And by 2018, 13 millions, 13 millions of people had to just walk away.

10:06.000 --> 10:13.000
Yeah, just imagine that suddenly the area that you are living is becoming like a desert.

10:13.000 --> 10:27.000
And if you used to like grow vegetables and have animals, and that suddenly is no longer an option, you will just have to relocate and go in another place.

10:27.000 --> 10:35.000
That's not very easy to do.

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
So now let's talk about petrol.

10:39.000 --> 10:44.000
About petrol and I found some very interesting details about petrol.

10:44.000 --> 10:56.000
On a global scale, we are using 15 billion, 15 billion liters of petrol every day.

10:56.000 --> 11:03.000
The petrol is cheaper than the cheapest soda, like a refresher.

11:03.000 --> 11:08.000
And I was blown away and Bill made some calculations.

11:08.000 --> 11:20.000
And the gas price, for example, in 2020 came on 26 cents per liter.

11:20.000 --> 11:25.000
I think he has done his calculations for USA, obviously.

11:25.000 --> 11:31.000
And the soda, the cheapest soda is 75 cents per liter.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
So imagine like petrol is really cheap, gas is really, really cheap.

11:37.000 --> 11:52.000
And this is why it's such an issue to convince anyone basically to choose the eco-friendly alternative

11:52.000 --> 11:59.000
because of the taxes and because of the Green Premium Edition.

11:59.000 --> 12:04.000
You pay extra if you want to eco-friendly.

12:04.000 --> 12:13.000
And you have noticed that everything that has that little label, you always pay extra.

12:13.000 --> 12:25.000
It's just because for the moment, it hasn't been found a solution to cut down the cost of producing something more green, more eco.

12:25.000 --> 12:37.000
And the issue is that until any type of technology gets adopted, it takes time.

12:37.000 --> 12:40.000
So Bill Gates says that.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
And we have noticed this throughout the history.

12:43.000 --> 12:50.000
Remember how long it took until all people had a computer in their homes?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
It took years.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.000
How many years did it take until every family had a car?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
It took years.

12:58.000 --> 13:05.000
So adopting a new technology means maybe decades, decades.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
It's the same with green energy.

13:08.000 --> 13:28.000
The only issue that we have is the fact that by the time all of us will be able to adopt it, the climate will maybe be severely damaged.

13:28.000 --> 13:38.000
So Bill starts to talk about the main industries and the main areas of our lives that cause the most pollution.

13:38.000 --> 13:44.000
And he starts with the fossil fuel and the coal industry.

13:44.000 --> 14:00.000
So because of the pollution caused by coal exploitation, there are more people dying because of this because in comparison with all of the nuclear incidents.

14:00.000 --> 14:12.000
I know that when nuclear is spelled in a sentence, it automatically triggers a lot of mixed emotions because

14:12.000 --> 14:29.000
I must tell you that I was amazed to find out that using nuclear energy is the only type of energy that is green like it does not cause any release of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

14:29.000 --> 14:36.000
So it's the greenest of the alternatives, the nuclear energy.

14:36.000 --> 14:45.000
And because of the incidents that happened, let's just mention like the Chernobyl, people are very, very reluctant.

14:45.000 --> 15:00.000
You know, like I'm pretty sure if someone would come and knock on your door and tell you, hey, we are planning to build a nuclear power plant in here.

15:00.000 --> 15:18.000
I bet people would almost entirely say no because there's a lot of fright and a lot of prejudice, you know, because people do not know these facts, basically.

15:19.000 --> 15:26.000
So let's name the guilty ones.

15:26.000 --> 15:40.000
Bell makes a list with the main five guilty industries that are contributing to the overall pollution and climate change.

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
It's about the production process, basically.

15:44.000 --> 16:01.000
It's about concrete, steel, plastic, and 31% out of the greenhouse effect gases are being produced because of this process.

16:01.000 --> 16:14.000
So all of the buildings that need these materials, these three basic materials, they are responsible for the pollution that is happening.

16:14.000 --> 16:43.000
Another responsible is connecting at the electricity network, 27% of the gases, agriculture, 19%, and I'll make a small little note, stop eating burgers.

16:43.000 --> 17:08.000
I was blown away to find out that in order to produce the meat and the burgers, you need a lot of land, and not only that, but the cows are responsible for these gases because they also release a methane in the air because of the...

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Flatulence!

17:10.000 --> 17:30.000
I was like, even Bell was so funny when he specified this, that it doesn't look like a very serious deal to say that the flatulence of the cows that help you eat the burgers are affecting the planet, but it's actually very true.

17:31.000 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, transportation, going from A to B, 16%, and maintaining hot or cool air or heating or cooling your house, it's 7%.

17:49.000 --> 17:54.000
So these are the main responsibles.

17:55.000 --> 18:13.000
In Switzerland, we have a sort of a machine CDA that is supposed to absorb the CO2 from the atmosphere, so it's basically like a big vacuum that could just absorb everything from our air and purify it.

18:14.000 --> 18:27.000
But check this out, it would cost 5.1 trillions of dollars every year in order to solve the problem.

18:27.000 --> 18:42.000
Okay, this sounds very unlikely for me to happen. I don't think that any government would be willing to spend so much money to clean up the air.

18:43.000 --> 19:04.000
Bell talks about the poor areas on our planet, especially about the sub-Saharan Africa, where 600 million people do not have access to electricity.

19:04.000 --> 19:24.000
So this is the irony of this planet, I would say, that the poor people are going to be the most affected by what the rich people are doing.

19:24.000 --> 19:44.000
So Bell is an example about agriculture, for example, like a farmer from Switzerland or from USA is much better equipped to deal with the consequences of bad climate on his crops than a farmer in Africa.

19:44.000 --> 20:00.000
A lot of farmers in Africa are already struggling to make a living from agriculture, so if the weather goes bad and their crops are being banished, they're done.

20:01.000 --> 20:26.000
So I have found this to be very ironic and very sad and just like, almost like cynical that as our salaries grow and as the just well-being level grows throughout Europe and USA,

20:26.000 --> 20:38.000
people can afford more, so people spend more, so people get an extra car, they get air conditioners, they get a lot of stuff, and that just raises the level of pollution.

20:39.000 --> 20:58.000
And unfortunately, the poor people in Africa and other underdeveloped areas, they will suffer more than those who have bought their air conditioners. It's quite sad, I think.

20:59.000 --> 21:26.000
So the fossil fuels, they are giving us two thirds of all of the energy that we are generating. So the problem with fossil fuels is that they are very cheap, they give a lot of energy and it's very hard to convince the titans in the industry to say,

21:26.000 --> 21:45.000
okay, I'm not going to use this resource and go to a 10x or 100x more expensive eco solution. So it's a vicious circle and very hard to solve, actually.

21:46.000 --> 22:06.000
And the great issue with energy and its storage, how do you store? So let's assume that we are able to find green alternatives for energy, but how do we store it?

22:06.000 --> 22:25.000
That's another issue. You would need huge batteries, it's unimaginable. So this is another issue of green energy because even if you would obtain it, how do you store it?

22:25.000 --> 22:50.000
So it's like a loop, you know, it's a loop of issues. Bill mentions in 2021 a project called Express TransWest. It's a project about transmitting the energy generated by the wind in Wyoming and get that to California.

22:50.000 --> 23:09.000
It will become operational in 2024. I haven't researched if it is operational. I'm really curious about that. And that's happening 17 years after starting it. So it takes time. So it takes a lot of time.

23:10.000 --> 23:30.000
So the nuclear energy is the only source of energy without carbon emissions. So it can provide you with electricity day in and night out. So yeah, it's really good. I was amazed.

23:30.000 --> 23:51.000
So Bill talks about the two processes in the nuclear energy that can be used to obtain energy. It's about using the energy when the atoms, they split or when they get united.

23:51.000 --> 24:05.000
So the issue with those is that they can leave radioactive waste.

24:06.000 --> 24:24.000
So even with nuclear energy, we have to think about, okay, what do we do with that radioactive waste? So I have discovered that there is no solution without a problem to solve afterwards.

24:24.000 --> 24:37.000
So we have to find ways in which we can tackle the entire period of consequences for any solution, as green as it can sound.

24:37.000 --> 25:03.000
So bringing the atoms together is better than and using that energy is better because the radioactive, the waste is radioactive only for a couple of hundred of years in comparison with the other method with the fusion where the waste can remain radioactive for a thousand of years.

25:03.000 --> 25:21.000
That's a significant difference, I would say. The problem is that we need a lot of energy to start that reaction. So in order to start the reaction, now we need a lot of energy. That's the problem.

25:21.000 --> 25:44.000
There's another project in France about this. So this project is supposed to start in 2030 and it's supposed to generate plasma and energy from its type of nuclear reaction.

25:51.000 --> 26:11.000
There's also talks about the wind energy and the biggest user of wind turbines by using the coast wind is UK. I was amazed to find this out.

26:11.000 --> 26:37.000
So this is pretty much it about the coal, about the steel. Oh, mentioning the steel. Producing one ton of steel makes 1.8 tons of CO2. That's a lot.

26:37.000 --> 26:58.000
So all of the steel in the buildings, they came with a price. So let's move on to agriculture. So here, Bill mentions a very important person that has made quite a significant contribution to agriculture.

26:58.000 --> 27:21.000
It's about Norman Borlaug that took the Nobel Prize in 1970. He has developed a different type of wheat with a shorter stem and with a bigger size.

27:22.000 --> 27:39.000
And all of the wheat that is growing today in the world is derived from the plant developed by this engineer. So Norman did a huge service to humanity.

27:39.000 --> 28:06.000
Another significant improvement in agriculture came with the development of the synthetic product that farmers use in order to nourish their crops.

28:06.000 --> 28:30.000
So without that, a lot of people in really poor areas, they can't improve their soil otherwise. So developing this product, this synthetic product really helped a lot of people and Fritz Haber and Karl Bosch managed to do this process.

28:37.000 --> 28:56.000
There are also talks about the forest. I was very sad to read this statistic that in the entire world we have lost more than 1.3 million square kilometers of forest from 1990s until now.

28:56.000 --> 29:14.000
And it's really not beneficial for us because 1.3 can absorb 4 tons of CO2 in 40 years. So the trees basically absorb all of the toxic CO2 out of the atmosphere.

29:14.000 --> 29:35.000
So when we are cutting and using them to burn or to burn them, we are doing double, double damage. We are extracting a plant, a product that can help us and we're also releasing CO2 while burning it.

29:36.000 --> 29:54.000
So again, we go to another guilty factor, the transportation.

29:55.000 --> 30:11.000
So there have been works done when it comes to using green energy for transportation, but for example in cases of playing, it's very unlikely to have that developed in the future.

30:11.000 --> 30:34.000
Because the best, the best top notch electric plane that has been built, it can transport two people at a maximum speed of 340 kilometers per hour and it can fly only for three hours until it can be recharged.

30:35.000 --> 30:57.000
So this is not a reliable plane that a big company would want to adopt because yeah, using kerosene and the classical fuels for planes, it's what gets people from A to B really, really fast and really, really cheap.

30:57.000 --> 31:09.000
So we need technology and we need people with brilliant minds to find alternatives basically.

31:09.000 --> 31:17.000
Yeah, this statistic again shocked me.

31:17.000 --> 31:23.000
So the population on the planet is keep on rising.

31:23.000 --> 31:42.000
So in order to provide shelter for people, we will need to add 232 billions of buildings until 2060.

31:42.000 --> 31:51.000
That is the equivalent of building a New York every month for 40 years.

31:51.000 --> 32:10.000
So I think that we also need to find alternative ways to develop buildings and places to live that would not require so much pay and so much fuel and so much concrete.

32:10.000 --> 32:31.000
So again, I think innovation and there has and not only innovation, but we need to think the buildings in a different way, like much more green buildings, you know, and there is such a building bullet center in Seattle.

32:31.000 --> 32:40.000
It's one of the greenest commercial buildings in the world, but it was very, very expensive to build.

32:40.000 --> 32:50.000
We need a concept that is cheap, that is available, and that we can use from commercial to urban.

32:50.000 --> 33:17.000
And again, I think challenge in a way I can understand while Bell is quite in a dilemma because the problems are so many and they are so all interconnected that the solutions will have to be very, very, I don't know, original and new and cheap.

33:17.000 --> 33:43.000
That's the problem because people are not willing to spend a ton of money or pay for greener electricity like have their bill cost raise up to 100% or 200% just for the sake of the planet like people who live on day by day will be not motivated.

33:43.000 --> 33:59.000
They will say okay, screw the planet like I don't have the money, a greener bill for my electricity gives me the cheap, polluting friendly alternatives because I can't afford it.

33:59.000 --> 34:21.000
And this is another factor about the taxes, the extra taxes that you have to pay for these alternatives because they cost more and I can understand why people would not be willing to adopt it.

34:21.000 --> 34:31.000
Yeah, the cost, I think the cost is the biggest issue.

34:31.000 --> 34:46.000
So we go on the third, like, second, the third factor, the agriculture just a lot of talk about agriculture, it's quite a predominant subject in this book.

34:46.000 --> 35:03.000
So there's a talk about the mangrove alternative because the mangrove can help stabilize the soil against flooding.

35:03.000 --> 35:14.000
So when flooding happens, these mangroves are able to somehow be like a buffer front of this phenomenon.

35:14.000 --> 35:37.000
And there's a new field emerging, geoengineering and this is about making temporary adjustments in the oceans or in the atmosphere in order to cool down the planet.

35:37.000 --> 35:52.000
So Bill here said that a lot of people are against geoengineering because it looks like we are playing God and you're trying to really like change the planet.

35:52.000 --> 36:10.000
But for me it makes sense because there was a story about somehow changing the way the clouds absorb and to make the clouds much more luminous in order to reflect sunlight and if you managed to do that for a couple of days or a couple of months,

36:10.000 --> 36:15.000
you really have an impact and then you can stop.

36:15.000 --> 36:39.000
But it makes sense because I think it would be maybe cheaper in comparison with trying to make the people adopt costly alternatives to what they are using for their daily lives like transportation, what they're eating.

36:39.000 --> 37:00.000
Yeah, so I don't know, it's really like, I was wondering that like even if a very brilliant mind like the bell gate, like bell gates has, even if he is struggling with this issue, finding solutions and finding alternatives,

37:01.000 --> 37:19.000
this gives me a depth of the problem and it's so complex because it doesn't come only from what we are eating or it doesn't come from where we are going and how often we are traveling.

37:19.000 --> 37:48.000
They're all like interconnected, interweaved, so yeah, it's a very complicated issue so I can understand why it's so complicated, it has become almost like a cliche because I suppose that not a lot of people would go in depth and really try to find out what's this thing with the climate change, you know?

37:48.000 --> 38:15.000
Yeah, there's a talk about Denmark, we all know that all of the Nordic countries are a bit ahead of everyone almost, but Denmark is producing half of its electricity supply from the wind, from the wind.

38:15.000 --> 38:25.000
And it's the biggest exporter of wind turbines in the world.

38:25.000 --> 38:41.000
Wow, I was like, of course, doing this, it does not apply to every country but not every country has this sort of geographical positioning so they could use the wind.

38:42.000 --> 39:09.000
But those that do, it makes sense for them to invest in it and not only that but I think it makes sense because it's like you are obtaining a sort of freedom when it comes to electricity that is using natural resources that are there, you know?

39:09.000 --> 39:38.000
But you only have to use them, you know, so I think what this book maybe doesn't have is maybe a list with all of the natural assets that every country or yeah, every country on the planet would have and it would make them like approach finding an energy supply.

39:39.000 --> 39:56.000
In a wiser way, for example, okay, if you have a lot of sun, use it, if you have a lot of wind, use it, if you have a lot of water and use it, so yeah, I think it should be consensus, you know?

39:56.000 --> 40:20.000
Have each country find alternatives for energy but find them from nature and from the natural resources they have been given, for example, UK is using like the winds, Denmark is using them, so yeah, I think this is still a new territory, I think.

40:27.000 --> 40:44.000
So, there's a super story of a family in Kenya that grabbed my attention, let me just find it because I really liked it.

40:45.000 --> 41:06.000
So, yeah, this is like the farmer and Bill talks that in 2009 he went to visit Miriam and Laban Palaam at the farm in Kabyet, Kenya.

41:07.000 --> 41:19.000
So, they also have three children and the farmers are living in Kenya with less than one hectare of land.

41:19.000 --> 41:38.000
So, what happened? Two years before being visited by Bill, they were small farmers that practiced a really basic agriculture just to make a living.

41:39.000 --> 41:44.000
They were cultivating corn which is quite common and veggies.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.000
They also had a cow that they milked two times per day.

41:53.000 --> 42:13.000
In total, the cow would give them three liters of milk and that's quite little, three liters of milk for a family with five members, that's quite little.

42:14.000 --> 42:24.000
So, after two years, like when Bill has met this family, their life was completely different, what has changed?

42:24.000 --> 42:39.000
So, first of all, they had four cows, they were producing 26 liters of milk, they were selling 20 liters, they were keeping six liters for their own consumption.

42:40.000 --> 42:44.000
So, they were winning four dollars a day.

42:44.000 --> 43:01.000
So, in Kenya, with four dollars per day, they were able to rebuild some parts of the house, you know, to cultivate pineapple for export and also to be able to sustain their children in school.

43:02.000 --> 43:17.000
So, what happened? It was a decisive moment where when a farm, a factory for cooling the milk was opened near their town where they live.

43:17.000 --> 43:40.000
In that place, that factory, there were people that managed to educate farmers and tell them what they could use on their crops and what could they use for their cows to help the cow give more milk and to keep them healthy.

43:40.000 --> 43:45.000
And this helped them a lot.

43:46.000 --> 44:01.000
So, the average Kenyan is producing 55 less carbon dioxide than the average American.

44:02.000 --> 44:04.000
Yeah.

44:04.000 --> 44:29.000
So, the family in Kenya was saved by education, basically, because a lot of people that live there and they try to make a living, maybe they do not have access to the knowledge, like to better seeds, to better care for their cows, to just information.

44:29.000 --> 44:33.000
And having that factory open, it helped them.

44:33.000 --> 44:47.000
So, did the farmer raise his carbon print? Yes, but it's very insignificant in comparison with a farmer from Texas, for example.

44:47.000 --> 45:12.000
So, I think that it's very important to specify that Bell says that it wouldn't be fair, and I agree, it wouldn't be fair to say, let's, like, if the people from the poorer area try to raise their head above water and just make a better living,

45:12.000 --> 45:17.000
they will contribute to the pollution of the planet, so they should not advance.

45:17.000 --> 45:29.000
But that's not fair, because it's like, why should they pay for, like, the consequences for the rich people that brought the planet into this point?

45:29.000 --> 45:48.000
So, Bell says that we have to find alternatives for farmers and the people in the poorer areas to also level up their lifestyle, but without contributing so much to the climate change.

45:48.000 --> 46:07.000
So, it's a very complicated issue, and let me just say, I think in chapter 11, Bell starts to offer us 10 solutions, or 10.

46:07.000 --> 46:18.000
In chapter 10, it must be, yeah, in 10, no, in 11, yeah.

46:18.000 --> 46:28.000
So, this is like the part with the solutions from the book, and this is like the part with the problems.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.000
So, it's definitely not very encouraging.

46:33.000 --> 46:46.000
Yeah, so Bell presents us his plan to reach zero, like, zero emissions, no?

46:46.000 --> 47:09.000
And he says that it can be done, and he remembers his times when he had a dream with his friend Paul Allen, when founding Microsoft, to be able to let, like, have each person on the planet have a computer, you know?

47:09.000 --> 47:14.000
So, it looked pretty wild, but now it's possible.

47:14.000 --> 47:29.000
So, this makes Bell also think that, okay, we can also make this happen in the environment, you know?

47:29.000 --> 47:38.000
We can also, like, yeah, make it happen somehow.

47:38.000 --> 47:42.000
It looks like a fantasy until someone gets it done, you know?

47:42.000 --> 47:49.000
Each dream, it looks like a fantasy until someone gets it done, you know?

47:49.000 --> 47:56.000
Ah, yeah.

47:56.000 --> 48:17.000
And he says that we need a lot of sciences to contribute to this, because we need a common effort, you know?

48:17.000 --> 48:31.000
It's not enough to have one actor, you know, from one industry to take action.

48:31.000 --> 48:35.000
We need a common effort, you know?

48:35.000 --> 48:39.000
And this can only be done through collaboration.

48:39.000 --> 48:42.000
It's not through pointing fingers, you know?

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
Agriculture is to blame.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
Oh, no, the fossil fuels.

48:46.000 --> 48:52.000
Oh, it's like, we are, like, the titans of all industries.

48:52.000 --> 49:06.000
Just say, okay, we all contributed to this mess, but this mess was somehow necessary in order for the world to be as it is now, you know?

49:06.000 --> 49:20.000
So we need a couple of sciences to collaborate and we need biology, we need chemistry, we need physics, we need political sciences, we need economy, we need engineering.

49:20.000 --> 49:29.000
So we need a lot of specialists to just gather up and now think about it, you know?

49:29.000 --> 49:35.000
Like, explore the depths of their minds and find out.

49:36.000 --> 49:43.000
So he talks about offer and demand.

49:43.000 --> 50:01.000
So he's trying to say that, for example, if you are going to choose to order a vegan burger instead of a classical burger, you will make a difference, because once you place that order, there is a demand.

50:01.000 --> 50:17.000
And if more people are doing it, then, of course, the big, big players in the market will listen, because everything that's happening now, it's like, offer and demand.

50:17.000 --> 50:24.000
Are people consuming more soda drinks and say, okay, we're going to create a product?

50:25.000 --> 50:32.000
Are people, do people want green cars and stuff like that and there's demand?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.000
Okay, we're going to produce that.

50:34.000 --> 50:51.000
So this is what this book maybe is trying to do, to instill a sense of personal responsibility and contribution in the problem, because you cannot wash your hands and say,

50:51.000 --> 50:58.000
I'm just one person in Europe and my habits do not make a difference.

50:58.000 --> 51:11.000
Yes, they do, because it's the power of the compound, the power of the many individual choices.

51:11.000 --> 51:22.000
So you pick it one day and you tell a friend or a sister or brother and maybe they will pick another thing and this adds up.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.000
It's like the snowball effect.

51:25.000 --> 51:40.000
So I think this is one thing that Bill tries to do in his book, to tell us that all of our individual choices will contribute to a change in the demand in the market.

51:41.000 --> 51:48.000
Because the big, if people would come, let's put it this way.

51:48.000 --> 51:55.000
If more people would come into a KFC and they would say, do you have a vegan option?

51:55.000 --> 51:59.000
And this would happen a thousand times per day.

51:59.000 --> 52:07.000
Probably the KFC management could say, okay, our crispy chicken is not so much in demand.

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
People want more vegan options.

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Okay, we need to change.

52:11.000 --> 52:23.000
And that will have an effect on the planet because they will need less chickens, you know, because people are no longer interested in chicken nuggets.

52:23.000 --> 52:28.000
But if people are not trying to change their own habits, guess what?

52:28.000 --> 52:41.000
The market will give them what they want because if you were to have a business and you want to make money, you are like the client is your master.

52:41.000 --> 52:49.000
And the client will tell you what he wants and you will deliver because you want to make money.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
And it makes sense.

52:53.000 --> 53:11.000
I like that Bill does not point fingers in order to make people guilty because in our industry, even the biggest burger chain, they are providing to people what they want.

53:12.000 --> 53:30.000
So maybe I'm thinking that in a similar situation like with the farmer in Kenya, people need education, people need to be told, hey, do you know that there's separate alternatives to the classical burgers?

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
You could have this and that.

53:33.000 --> 53:50.000
The problem in perspective in the sense that you want your children to need healthier air, you want your grandchildren to live on a good planet, you know, because we will be gone by natural causes.

53:50.000 --> 53:54.000
People get born and they die every day.

53:54.000 --> 53:58.000
But the planet, we are stuck here for the moment.

53:59.000 --> 54:07.000
So for the next 100 or 500 years, I do not see people colonizing different planets.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.000
Like this is what we've got.

54:10.000 --> 54:14.000
And yeah, we need education.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.000
Yeah.

54:17.000 --> 54:21.000
And we need also innovation.

54:21.000 --> 54:26.000
And I would dare to say that we need scientists.

54:26.000 --> 54:38.000
We need people like Einstein and people like Max Planck and people like Tesla to invent new things, you know.

54:38.000 --> 54:48.000
So Bill makes a list with the necessary technologies that we need.

54:48.000 --> 54:54.000
We need zero carbon concrete steel.

54:54.000 --> 55:04.000
We need based on plants and on cells, you know, you can create in the lab.

55:04.000 --> 55:08.000
We need to find a way to store energy.

55:08.000 --> 55:11.000
We need a geothermal energy.

55:11.000 --> 55:17.000
We need a subterranean transmission of electricity.

55:17.000 --> 55:27.000
There was one great idea that I liked about finding a way to transmit electricity, you know, the excess of electricity underground.

55:27.000 --> 55:34.000
But the problem is that you have to find cables that do not overheat much.

55:34.000 --> 55:44.000
Because electricity, like, go like, do not touch but cables through which electricity is transmitted, they can get pretty hot.

55:44.000 --> 56:05.000
So trying to send a lot of electricity underground without any system to ventilate that underground, obviously, is another issue that has to be solved by brilliant scientists, I would say.

56:05.000 --> 56:14.000
Yeah, we also need electrophiles, electrophiles, we need biofuels.

56:14.000 --> 56:25.000
We need nuclear energy, but we need to find ways in which to make it safe.

56:25.000 --> 56:34.000
We need the government to increase the budget for research and developing clear energy.

56:34.000 --> 56:41.000
And Bill's makes a comparison of the budget that the government gave for health.

56:41.000 --> 56:49.000
And the National Institute for Health, it has, it had a budget of 36 billions of dollars.

56:49.000 --> 56:59.000
But for research, the budget is only seven billions of dollars.

56:59.000 --> 57:17.000
But Bill states, and I can see his logic, that the investment, the bigger investment in research would pay, would pay itself off dividends because of the compound effects it will have on the climate.

57:17.000 --> 57:36.000
So you invest more in research now, but you will reap the benefits decades and hundreds of years later.

57:36.000 --> 57:53.000
Bill also says, again, for the government, that it would be a good idea to invest in a project of research and developing with higher risk and great results.

57:53.000 --> 58:00.000
And he gives an example of the human genome project.

58:00.000 --> 58:19.000
And it was a very high risk project, but it paid off dividends because for each dollar that government invested, it was an earning of $141 was reaped for the economy of the United States.

58:19.000 --> 58:24.000
So, yeah.

58:24.000 --> 58:32.000
A solution is also to accelerate the demands for innovations.

58:32.000 --> 58:43.000
To have stimulants that can reduce the risks and costs.

58:43.000 --> 58:49.000
To have a price for the carbon.

58:49.000 --> 58:59.000
And he says that people should pay extra if they choose the options that are increasing their food carbon print.

58:59.000 --> 59:05.000
So if I have an alternative to go green and I don't, I will pay extra.

59:05.000 --> 59:06.000
And it makes sense.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
For example, look at air conditioning units.

59:10.000 --> 59:19.000
You know, there is that there are those labels that tell you it's a plus plus it's a plus it's B it's C.

59:19.000 --> 59:26.000
So you might get a cheaper air conditioning unit at the beginning.

59:26.000 --> 59:38.000
But on the long term, that will be very costly for you because energetically like it's inefficient and it's consumption, it's preposterous, you know.

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
On the contrary, if you invest in a more expensive air conditioning unit.

59:44.000 --> 59:48.000
And it has like better energy consumption.

59:48.000 --> 01:00:07.000
You will reap the benefits months and years after, like because your electricity bill will be lighter because that is better thought in terms of consumption, you know.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000
They'll also say that we should have a standard.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
So here is the complicated thing.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:23.000
In order to develop a worldwide standard, you have to put nations to agree.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Having so many nations, so many different interests, you know, to agree on a standard.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
That's the challenge.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
That's a challenge.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:45.000
No, he also says that we should throw away the old stuff like.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And including like factory and places where they are trying to energy, but they're very inefficient and bill is going through the tear down and rebuild again approach.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:21.000
But I can understand why this can be again, something that not a lot of people would agree with because they would, they have like the sunk cost fallacy in the sense that oh, we have invested so much into building this.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:27.000
I know power plant and how can we like carry down and build another one like Wow.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But again, sometimes it's good to let go of the things that are not efficient anymore.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Think of the, for example, as a comparison, the old vintage cars, the old vintage cars that some people keep and actually drive.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
But those cars are like punges for gas.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:59.000
They, they have a crazy consumption of gas.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Like it's not, it's not smart to continue to drive them.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
It's just ludicrous.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Like you can keep them for beauty, but driving that it would make your pockets stink.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Like, and take this analogy with the energy exploitation and the factories or maybe the plants.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Again, it doesn't make sense to them running if they are just making money.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000
No.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Let's talk about the government, about the authority.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:51.000
And in chapter 12 Bill says, how can we each of us contribute as a citizen?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:03:09.000
And they suggest that we should be much more active in the political scene in the sense that we should see who is responsible for clean energy in our city to get in contact with them.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Yeah.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:27.000
And he also has some talks about the politics.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Yeah.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:39.000
So there's a lot of talk about the politics and the governments and their impact on this problem.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:58.000
And, yeah, it makes it makes a lot of sense because for any law to approve, it has to go through the process of the bureaucratic process of being adopted.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:17.000
So I liked this book, but I admit that I would have liked for it to have a thicker part of the solutions because the problems God knows there are so many.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:35.000
And I, my intuition tells me that we need some really good, good scientists to put their minds together and find solutions.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:52.000
You know, so I understand it makes sense to delegate more money and more resources to research, you know, that kind of activity that maybe a lot of citizens find boring or unnecessary.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:05:19.000
But let's take a minute to go back in history and realize that everything that we normal common people enjoy has happened because bad scientists, someone who has studied and did a lot of research was able to find an idea like the light bulb, the electricity, the wheat, the, you know,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:40.000
we need to support the people and allocate funds for them in order to get better alternatives, you know, investing in education and innovation is really, really important.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:51.000
Well, these invisible people that nobody sees because they are with their heads in the box and studying and doing experiments.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:06:00.000
These are the people that put our money and our bets on because they will manage to find a solution.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Yeah.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:06.000
So this is it about this book.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:16.000
I think it's a necessary reading, because we have to think a bit further than our immediate horizon.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:32.000
And I think we have all seen at least, I don't know for you, but for me at least in the last five years, you could see in your country that change of seasons is not the same.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.000
The winters are not the same anymore.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:59.000
The autumns like everything is shifting and it's definitely warmer and you have temperatures in January and February that are like shocking, you know, because 20 years ago, in Europe, at least in February, it will be very cold in winter, but now it's like springtime.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:21.000
So for us that are a bit older, we can see those things happening, you know, children and teachers now, maybe they haven't gone through so many seasons, but those who have been living for quite a while, they can get the difference.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:32.000
And it's pretty scary to realize that this whole climate change is very much real.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Okay.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Thank you very much for listening to me and I'll see you next time for the next book review.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Bye bye.
