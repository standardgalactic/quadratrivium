00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Hey guys, Brandy here.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,440
So today I'm going to talk to you guys about the importance of GitHub, why we use it, and

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:19,760
why employers are looking at it, and then exactly how to structure your projects on

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
there.

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,560
So when future employers do go there, they know exactly what it is that they're looking

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,560
at.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,760
So this is GitHub, and it probably looks pretty familiar to you.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,120
These are all the different repositories that you're a part of, and people that you follow.

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,760
And so what you want to do, or what employers do, is they go over to your profile, and they

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,000
can take a look at your different repositories that you have, and then one of their major

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,280
things that they look at is your contributions for the year, because what this tells them

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,720
is exactly how active you are on GitHub.

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,680
Why this is so important is companies are looking for people that are contributing to

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,360
open source projects, as well as growing their knowledge on their own, so whether that's

15
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,440
doing tutorials or building your own projects from scratch.

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,200
So regardless of what it is that you're doing, whether it's a tutorial, or your own project,

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,920
or open source, or whatever, make sure that you're still committing everything to GitHub,

18
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,000
and then organize it accordingly, which is what we're going to jump into next.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,600
So we're on GitHub.

20
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,120
Let's take a look at the different things in this particular repository that you need

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:39,080
to make sure that you have on the projects that you have on your portfolio, or the ones

22
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,320
that you are showing a prospective employer.

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,760
So you can see at the top that this was a code test that I did for IBM back in 2006.

24
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:57,160
So these are all the things that I would highly suggest that you have on your GitHub repository.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:02,560
So when a prospective employer comes to look at the different projects on your portfolio,

26
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,320
they know exactly what it is that they are looking at.

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,760
So the first thing is the read me.

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,360
You want to make sure that you have a title or the name of the project that you built.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:25,000
Second, you want to have a link to the live project you can host wherever, depending on

30
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,240
what type of project it is, or what type of job that you are trying to apply.

31
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,960
You may want to do some research on where you should be hosting.

32
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,760
The next part is you want to headline of what the app is.

33
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,840
Like this one is a photo viewing app for the space enthusiasts.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,640
And yes, when I'm done with this, I will show you the app that I built.

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:51,000
And this was just a task that they asked me to do.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,040
They said I could build it with any sort of technologies, but I did need to use the Flickr

37
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,400
API.

38
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,880
So here was the task.

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,840
Build a Flickr web app that fetches images from NASA's account via the Flickr API.

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,080
You're welcome to use any technology to build and design the layout in any way that you see fit.

41
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,000
So what I would put here is why you're building what you are building.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,800
Maybe there's a reason behind your application or there's a need that you are meeting or

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,960
a problem that you're solving.

44
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,400
That's what I would specify.

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,440
So the criteria for this particular one was actually the criteria for this particular

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,120
task that they gave me.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,000
So you may not actually have this on yours, but it's not a bad idea if you are using a

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,240
tutorial or if you are doing a code challenge for an employer.

49
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,740
So here is a summary of this stack.

50
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,480
You can list this out or you can write it the way I wrote it in paragraph form.

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,720
It's really up to you and what type of message you're trying to get across.

52
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,240
And so for me, since this was a code challenge for a company, I wanted to make sure that

53
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,560
they knew that I understood why I was using the things I was using.

54
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,000
The next thing you want to have is functionality.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,120
What does your app do?

56
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,800
When I go to it, what should I expect from it?

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,140
And also the design.

58
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,640
I know we're developers, but we should still have an idea of design.

59
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,440
Like my last video that I showed you guys of how to get a job in tech, you need to be

60
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,920
familiar with everything that goes into the process of building an app.

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,400
And that includes design and design principles.

62
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:43,720
The next thing that you have is how to run the project locally.

63
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,200
So what this means if you're not familiar is say you send this to somebody and they

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,680
want to run it and play around and kind of dive into the project itself.

65
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,600
Well you want to make sure that you can give them the proper steps in order for them to

66
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,800
do this.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
So this is pretty simple.

68
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:07,200
They would just clone down my repository, install all my libraries, and then run.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,320
The next part is I actually list out all the different technologies that I used from the

70
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,440
above paragraph where I state why I used them.

71
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,480
So both of these are great because it really showcases that you have a very well understanding

72
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,080
of what it is that you used and why it is that you used it.

73
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,560
Alright so I will show you guys this application.

74
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,360
So here is spacegram you guys.

75
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,360
You can probably tell I got some inspiration from Instagram and it looks like my little

76
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,800
hearts are messed up.

77
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,240
Haven't looked at this in a while.

78
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,200
But you can see that I'm pulling in images and I'm pulling in the title.

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,040
From their API I can type in Mars and I'm getting a photo.

80
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,120
Looks like I can just type in M. This is just going to search through the titles.

81
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,000
So that is spacegram.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,200
Once again this was actually a code challenge that I did for IBM.

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,360
Alright you guys thank you so much for watching this quick video on the importance of GitHub

84
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,840
and how exactly to structure your projects.

85
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,280
I hope you guys liked that.

86
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,960
If you did please give it a thumbs up and I would love it if you would subscribe to my

87
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,960
channel.

88
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Thank you so much.

89
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,320
I hope you guys have a great day.
