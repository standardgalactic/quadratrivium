0	9000	Hey guys, Brandy here.
9000	14440	So today I'm going to talk to you guys about the importance of GitHub, why we use it, and
14440	19760	why employers are looking at it, and then exactly how to structure your projects on
19760	20760	there.
20760	24560	So when future employers do go there, they know exactly what it is that they're looking
24560	25560	at.
25560	30760	So this is GitHub, and it probably looks pretty familiar to you.
30760	35120	These are all the different repositories that you're a part of, and people that you follow.
35120	42760	And so what you want to do, or what employers do, is they go over to your profile, and they
42760	47000	can take a look at your different repositories that you have, and then one of their major
47000	51280	things that they look at is your contributions for the year, because what this tells them
51520	57720	is exactly how active you are on GitHub.
57720	62680	Why this is so important is companies are looking for people that are contributing to
62680	67360	open source projects, as well as growing their knowledge on their own, so whether that's
67360	71440	doing tutorials or building your own projects from scratch.
71440	76200	So regardless of what it is that you're doing, whether it's a tutorial, or your own project,
76200	80920	or open source, or whatever, make sure that you're still committing everything to GitHub,
80920	88000	and then organize it accordingly, which is what we're going to jump into next.
88000	89600	So we're on GitHub.
89600	94120	Let's take a look at the different things in this particular repository that you need
94120	99080	to make sure that you have on the projects that you have on your portfolio, or the ones
99080	102320	that you are showing a prospective employer.
102320	108760	So you can see at the top that this was a code test that I did for IBM back in 2006.
108800	117160	So these are all the things that I would highly suggest that you have on your GitHub repository.
117160	122560	So when a prospective employer comes to look at the different projects on your portfolio,
122560	126320	they know exactly what it is that they are looking at.
126320	129760	So the first thing is the read me.
129760	135360	You want to make sure that you have a title or the name of the project that you built.
135720	145000	Second, you want to have a link to the live project you can host wherever, depending on
145000	149240	what type of project it is, or what type of job that you are trying to apply.
149240	153960	You may want to do some research on where you should be hosting.
153960	157760	The next part is you want to headline of what the app is.
157760	162840	Like this one is a photo viewing app for the space enthusiasts.
162840	167640	And yes, when I'm done with this, I will show you the app that I built.
167640	171000	And this was just a task that they asked me to do.
171000	177040	They said I could build it with any sort of technologies, but I did need to use the Flickr
177040	179400	API.
179400	180880	So here was the task.
180880	185840	Build a Flickr web app that fetches images from NASA's account via the Flickr API.
185840	191080	You're welcome to use any technology to build and design the layout in any way that you see fit.
191080	196000	So what I would put here is why you're building what you are building.
196000	201800	Maybe there's a reason behind your application or there's a need that you are meeting or
201800	203960	a problem that you're solving.
203960	206400	That's what I would specify.
206400	212440	So the criteria for this particular one was actually the criteria for this particular
212440	216120	task that they gave me.
216120	222000	So you may not actually have this on yours, but it's not a bad idea if you are using a
222000	227240	tutorial or if you are doing a code challenge for an employer.
227240	229740	So here is a summary of this stack.
229740	234480	You can list this out or you can write it the way I wrote it in paragraph form.
234480	238720	It's really up to you and what type of message you're trying to get across.
238720	243240	And so for me, since this was a code challenge for a company, I wanted to make sure that
244240	249560	they knew that I understood why I was using the things I was using.
249560	253000	The next thing you want to have is functionality.
253000	255120	What does your app do?
255120	259800	When I go to it, what should I expect from it?
259800	262140	And also the design.
262140	266640	I know we're developers, but we should still have an idea of design.
266640	270440	Like my last video that I showed you guys of how to get a job in tech, you need to be
270920	274920	familiar with everything that goes into the process of building an app.
274920	279400	And that includes design and design principles.
279400	283720	The next thing that you have is how to run the project locally.
283720	288200	So what this means if you're not familiar is say you send this to somebody and they
288200	292680	want to run it and play around and kind of dive into the project itself.
292680	297600	Well you want to make sure that you can give them the proper steps in order for them to
297600	298800	do this.
298800	300200	So this is pretty simple.
300200	307200	They would just clone down my repository, install all my libraries, and then run.
308320	314320	The next part is I actually list out all the different technologies that I used from the
314320	319440	above paragraph where I state why I used them.
319440	325480	So both of these are great because it really showcases that you have a very well understanding
325480	331080	of what it is that you used and why it is that you used it.
331080	335560	Alright so I will show you guys this application.
335560	338360	So here is spacegram you guys.
338360	345360	You can probably tell I got some inspiration from Instagram and it looks like my little
345360	349800	hearts are messed up.
349800	351240	Haven't looked at this in a while.
351240	355200	But you can see that I'm pulling in images and I'm pulling in the title.
355200	361040	From their API I can type in Mars and I'm getting a photo.
361040	366120	Looks like I can just type in M. This is just going to search through the titles.
366120	369000	So that is spacegram.
369000	373200	Once again this was actually a code challenge that I did for IBM.
373200	378360	Alright you guys thank you so much for watching this quick video on the importance of GitHub
378360	380840	and how exactly to structure your projects.
380960	382280	I hope you guys liked that.
382280	385960	If you did please give it a thumbs up and I would love it if you would subscribe to my
385960	386960	channel.
386960	387960	Thank you so much.
387960	389320	I hope you guys have a great day.
