Hey guys, Brandy here.

00:09.000 --> 00:14.440
So today I'm going to talk to you guys about the importance of GitHub, why we use it, and

00:14.440 --> 00:19.760
why employers are looking at it, and then exactly how to structure your projects on

00:19.760 --> 00:20.760
there.

00:20.760 --> 00:24.560
So when future employers do go there, they know exactly what it is that they're looking

00:24.560 --> 00:25.560
at.

00:25.560 --> 00:30.760
So this is GitHub, and it probably looks pretty familiar to you.

00:30.760 --> 00:35.120
These are all the different repositories that you're a part of, and people that you follow.

00:35.120 --> 00:42.760
And so what you want to do, or what employers do, is they go over to your profile, and they

00:42.760 --> 00:47.000
can take a look at your different repositories that you have, and then one of their major

00:47.000 --> 00:51.280
things that they look at is your contributions for the year, because what this tells them

00:51.520 --> 00:57.720
is exactly how active you are on GitHub.

00:57.720 --> 01:02.680
Why this is so important is companies are looking for people that are contributing to

01:02.680 --> 01:07.360
open source projects, as well as growing their knowledge on their own, so whether that's

01:07.360 --> 01:11.440
doing tutorials or building your own projects from scratch.

01:11.440 --> 01:16.200
So regardless of what it is that you're doing, whether it's a tutorial, or your own project,

01:16.200 --> 01:20.920
or open source, or whatever, make sure that you're still committing everything to GitHub,

01:20.920 --> 01:28.000
and then organize it accordingly, which is what we're going to jump into next.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.600
So we're on GitHub.

01:29.600 --> 01:34.120
Let's take a look at the different things in this particular repository that you need

01:34.120 --> 01:39.080
to make sure that you have on the projects that you have on your portfolio, or the ones

01:39.080 --> 01:42.320
that you are showing a prospective employer.

01:42.320 --> 01:48.760
So you can see at the top that this was a code test that I did for IBM back in 2006.

01:48.800 --> 01:57.160
So these are all the things that I would highly suggest that you have on your GitHub repository.

01:57.160 --> 02:02.560
So when a prospective employer comes to look at the different projects on your portfolio,

02:02.560 --> 02:06.320
they know exactly what it is that they are looking at.

02:06.320 --> 02:09.760
So the first thing is the read me.

02:09.760 --> 02:15.360
You want to make sure that you have a title or the name of the project that you built.

02:15.720 --> 02:25.000
Second, you want to have a link to the live project you can host wherever, depending on

02:25.000 --> 02:29.240
what type of project it is, or what type of job that you are trying to apply.

02:29.240 --> 02:33.960
You may want to do some research on where you should be hosting.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.760
The next part is you want to headline of what the app is.

02:37.760 --> 02:42.840
Like this one is a photo viewing app for the space enthusiasts.

02:42.840 --> 02:47.640
And yes, when I'm done with this, I will show you the app that I built.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.000
And this was just a task that they asked me to do.

02:51.000 --> 02:57.040
They said I could build it with any sort of technologies, but I did need to use the Flickr

02:57.040 --> 02:59.400
API.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.880
So here was the task.

03:00.880 --> 03:05.840
Build a Flickr web app that fetches images from NASA's account via the Flickr API.

03:05.840 --> 03:11.080
You're welcome to use any technology to build and design the layout in any way that you see fit.

03:11.080 --> 03:16.000
So what I would put here is why you're building what you are building.

03:16.000 --> 03:21.800
Maybe there's a reason behind your application or there's a need that you are meeting or

03:21.800 --> 03:23.960
a problem that you're solving.

03:23.960 --> 03:26.400
That's what I would specify.

03:26.400 --> 03:32.440
So the criteria for this particular one was actually the criteria for this particular

03:32.440 --> 03:36.120
task that they gave me.

03:36.120 --> 03:42.000
So you may not actually have this on yours, but it's not a bad idea if you are using a

03:42.000 --> 03:47.240
tutorial or if you are doing a code challenge for an employer.

03:47.240 --> 03:49.740
So here is a summary of this stack.

03:49.740 --> 03:54.480
You can list this out or you can write it the way I wrote it in paragraph form.

03:54.480 --> 03:58.720
It's really up to you and what type of message you're trying to get across.

03:58.720 --> 04:03.240
And so for me, since this was a code challenge for a company, I wanted to make sure that

04:04.240 --> 04:09.560
they knew that I understood why I was using the things I was using.

04:09.560 --> 04:13.000
The next thing you want to have is functionality.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.120
What does your app do?

04:15.120 --> 04:19.800
When I go to it, what should I expect from it?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.140
And also the design.

04:22.140 --> 04:26.640
I know we're developers, but we should still have an idea of design.

04:26.640 --> 04:30.440
Like my last video that I showed you guys of how to get a job in tech, you need to be

04:30.920 --> 04:34.920
familiar with everything that goes into the process of building an app.

04:34.920 --> 04:39.400
And that includes design and design principles.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.720
The next thing that you have is how to run the project locally.

04:43.720 --> 04:48.200
So what this means if you're not familiar is say you send this to somebody and they

04:48.200 --> 04:52.680
want to run it and play around and kind of dive into the project itself.

04:52.680 --> 04:57.600
Well you want to make sure that you can give them the proper steps in order for them to

04:57.600 --> 04:58.800
do this.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.200
So this is pretty simple.

05:00.200 --> 05:07.200
They would just clone down my repository, install all my libraries, and then run.

05:08.320 --> 05:14.320
The next part is I actually list out all the different technologies that I used from the

05:14.320 --> 05:19.440
above paragraph where I state why I used them.

05:19.440 --> 05:25.480
So both of these are great because it really showcases that you have a very well understanding

05:25.480 --> 05:31.080
of what it is that you used and why it is that you used it.

05:31.080 --> 05:35.560
Alright so I will show you guys this application.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.360
So here is spacegram you guys.

05:38.360 --> 05:45.360
You can probably tell I got some inspiration from Instagram and it looks like my little

05:45.360 --> 05:49.800
hearts are messed up.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.240
Haven't looked at this in a while.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.200
But you can see that I'm pulling in images and I'm pulling in the title.

05:55.200 --> 06:01.040
From their API I can type in Mars and I'm getting a photo.

06:01.040 --> 06:06.120
Looks like I can just type in M. This is just going to search through the titles.

06:06.120 --> 06:09.000
So that is spacegram.

06:09.000 --> 06:13.200
Once again this was actually a code challenge that I did for IBM.

06:13.200 --> 06:18.360
Alright you guys thank you so much for watching this quick video on the importance of GitHub

06:18.360 --> 06:20.840
and how exactly to structure your projects.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.280
I hope you guys liked that.

06:22.280 --> 06:25.960
If you did please give it a thumbs up and I would love it if you would subscribe to my

06:25.960 --> 06:26.960
channel.

06:26.960 --> 06:27.960
Thank you so much.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.320
I hope you guys have a great day.
