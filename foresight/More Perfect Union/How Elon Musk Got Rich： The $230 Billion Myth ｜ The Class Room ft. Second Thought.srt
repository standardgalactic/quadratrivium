1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
I'm no saint, but I generally try to do the right thing.

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,840
Are you sincerely trying to save the world?

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:06,440
I'm trying to do good things.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,800
Good idea for an electric jet.

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,400
Impossible, no middle name.

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,600
Elon Musk has a pretty big pitch.

7
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,840
He's the good billionaire using his wealth

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,800
to protect the future of humanity.

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,800
It's gotten him something most billionaires don't have,

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,720
a fan base.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,960
I've never signed a big, a life-sized version of it.

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,200
First, I want to say I love you.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,920
A 2021 poll showed Musk with a 50% approval rating,

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,560
way higher than his fellow billionaires.

15
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,320
This popularity has done very well for him.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,840
Musk is now the seventh richest man in the world.

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,560
Musk is now the fourth richest man in the world.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:44,000
Elon Musk is now the world's richest person

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,840
again, according to Forbes.

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
We took a deep look into Musk's entire career,

21
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,880
court documents, SEC filings, and interviews

22
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:53,320
to break down the story Elon tells about himself

23
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,200
and how he leveraged it to accumulate wealth and power.

24
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,240
This is the classroom from More Perfect Union,

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,200
and today we're going to look at how Elon Musk got rich.

26
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,920
Let's skip Musk's South Africa childhood.

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,520
Critics say he inherited his money

28
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,840
from his father's emerald mine,

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,000
and Elon says that's not true.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,240
He claims he rejected his abusive father's

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
ill-begotten wealth and came to North America as a teen

32
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,280
with $2,000 to put himself through college.

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,360
He knew he wanted to work with the internet.

34
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,360
The only way to get involved with the internet in 95

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,640
that I could think of was to start a company,

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,120
because they weren't a lot of companies to go and work for.

37
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,280
So I thought, well, we've got to make something

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,600
that's going to return money very, very quickly.

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,640
Elon joined forces and funds with his brother Kimball.

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,520
They drummed up some cash from investors,

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,400
including $20K from their father,

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,560
and started Zip2, a map and local listing company.

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,280
Zip2 eventually planned to merge with CitySearch,

44
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,520
but Elon wouldn't have been in charge.

45
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,880
That did not sit well with him.

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,120
At the time, a CitySearch executive said

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,120
CitySearch wanted to focus on customers and financiers,

48
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:55,080
while Musk wanted to focus on general visibility.

49
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,680
Visibility for him.

50
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,360
I'd like to be on the cover of Rolling Stone.

51
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,640
That'd be cool.

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,520
These disagreements led to the deal falling apart.

53
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,200
This is a pattern for Elon,

54
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,440
a need for sole credit and control.

55
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,480
It's a huge part of his story.

56
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,920
Zip2 sold and Elon made $22 million,

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,080
which he invested in his next project.

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,520
I've sunk the great majority of my net worth

59
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,560
into Axe.com,

60
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,240
which is the new banking and mutual funds company.

61
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,520
So this is an ATM.

62
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,360
And what we're going to do

63
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,920
is transform the traditional banking industry.

64
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,360
That quote defines Musk's strategy,

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,080
promise revolutionary technology

66
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,440
and highlight how he's risking his own money.

67
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,360
And he also points out a key element of his success,

68
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,760
wooing investors.

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,600
Raising $50 million is a matter

70
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,560
of making a series of phone calls.

71
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,440
As Axe.com took shape,

72
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
investors and the board didn't think Musk

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
had the experience to be CEO.

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,120
So they brought in Bill Harris.

75
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,400
Elon's co-founders were also unhappy.

76
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,280
One accused him of promising the sun,

77
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,880
moon and the stars to the media

78
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,440
when there was nothing there.

79
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,480
Future SEC filings for the company

80
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,760
even mentioned a lack of proprietary technology

81
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,080
as a corporate risk.

82
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,440
The tech they did have was problematic.

83
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,840
For example, there was a bug allowing bad actors

84
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,520
to transfer funds from any account

85
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,880
in the nation's banking system

86
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,520
with just an account number,

87
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,320
a major security flaw.

88
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,400
A co-founder was so displeased with Musk,

89
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,640
he left and took many employees with him.

90
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,200
Musk's reaction, we'll hire more people.

91
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,760
Eventually Musk pushed out CEO Bill Harris

92
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,080
and replaced him with himself

93
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,680
to centralize authority.

94
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,720
X.com merged with a competitor,

95
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,360
Peter Teal's Confinity.

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,480
Confinity owned a piece of technology called PayPal.

97
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,960
Musk and Teal got glowing press coverage,

98
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,200
but because PayPal came out of Confinity,

99
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
a lot of the coverage centered Teal.

100
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,120
According to Ashley Vance's 2015 biography,

101
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,760
Musk kept championing the X.com brand

102
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,160
while most everyone else favored PayPal.

103
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,520
Eventually the company scrapped X.com to focus on PayPal,

104
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,920
a decision the press gave Musk credit for.

105
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,760
But mutiny was brewing.

106
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,400
Executive Rolof Botha alleged Musk was hiding

107
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,520
serious financial issues from the board.

108
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,480
Employees put together a coup.

109
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,560
They petitioned the board to fire Musk and it worked.

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,040
Musk was fired and replaced with Teal.

111
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,120
Botha said it was just in time.

112
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,520
It would have killed the company

113
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,680
if Elon had stayed on as CEO for six more months.

114
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,440
Regardless, Musk hits it big

115
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,280
when PayPal eventually sells, $180 million.

116
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,520
He had been laying the path for his next move since college.

117
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
When I was in college, there were three areas

118
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,000
that I thought would most affect the future of humanity.

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,480
The internet, the transition to a sustainable energy

120
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,360
and transportation sector, and space exploration,

121
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,720
and particularly the extension of life to multiple planets.

122
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,560
With the capital that I got from the sale of PayPal,

123
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,040
I was able to go into both those areas.

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
Enter SpaceX and Tesla.

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,440
Musk wasn't with Tesla at the start.

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,080
He invested in a company that already existed,

127
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
but most media calls him a founder.

128
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,840
What happened?

129
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,720
We spoke with Edward Niedermeyer,

130
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,920
author of Ludacris,

131
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,520
an in-depth examination of Tesla Motors.

132
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,200
Elon Musk was not one of the original founders of Tesla,

133
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,040
right?

134
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,960
There was these two guys, Martin Neighborhart

135
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,920
and Mark Tarpening, who had actually incorporated

136
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,080
the company.

137
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,560
Musk came in because he wanted to do the same thing.

138
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,520
But like with his previous companies,

139
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,440
Elon was focused on publicity,

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,040
specifically public perception of himself

141
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,480
as the visionary founder.

142
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Part and parcel of being a hot startup, right?

143
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,800
Is you have to have that sort of charismatic

144
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,520
visionary founder, but it wasn't Elon Musk.

145
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,840
It was Martin Neighborhart.

146
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
Neighborhart even had a BlackBerry ad

147
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,240
where he's being presented just like Steve Jobs

148
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
as this visionary tech guy.

149
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
And I think that was exactly the kind of thing

150
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,160
that Elon Musk really wanted out of Tesla

151
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,280
as much as anything else.

152
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,920
He sent an email saying, like, this is embarrassing.

153
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,640
You know, I'm an important part of this company

154
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,960
and I want to make sure that I'm included in the coverage.

155
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,960
And in these emails that leaked it, it makes it very clear

156
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,080
that being that guy,

157
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,880
being the visionary figurehead of this company

158
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,680
was really, really important to him.

159
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,800
So shortly after this whole exchange

160
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,360
and Musk getting really angry about his lack of prominence

161
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,840
in the media coverage,

162
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,520
he went and wrote the top secret master plan blog post.

163
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,000
And this was really Musk's coming out party,

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,160
positioning himself as really that visionary founder

165
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,320
for Tesla.

166
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,040
One of the really interesting things is that,

167
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,320
you know, there's really not a lot

168
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,320
in the top secret master plan strategically anyway,

169
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,640
that Tesla wasn't kind of already planning on doing.

170
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
It all culminated in Aberhard's ouster

171
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,440
and a series of lawsuits leading to a settlement

172
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,160
with an important stipulation.

173
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,640
Musk could legally call himself a co-founder of the company.

174
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,840
Musk knew that to acquire more power,

175
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,360
he needed to be called co-founder on paper.

176
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,040
Musk has long insisted he never wanted to be CEO of Tesla.

177
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,160
But after Aberhard's ouster,

178
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,400
they brought in, you know, two different new CEOs

179
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
before Musk himself eventually took over.

180
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,040
Musk took over at a rough time,

181
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,320
the 2008 financial crisis.

182
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,520
Tesla needed an influx of capital.

183
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
Musk's usual strategies wouldn't work.

184
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,600
The sources of capital that would normally provide that,

185
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,440
such as the public markets, the debt markets,

186
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,520
they're in shambles.

187
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,840
But a year earlier,

188
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,920
Congress passed a $25 billion loan program

189
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,320
for the Department of Energy,

190
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,240
part of which would go to developing low-emission cars.

191
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
Musk went on a media blitz trying to convince the public

192
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
that Tesla deserved the loan.

193
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,120
It's helpful to let your congressman center know

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,520
that you think companies like Tesla

195
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,480
should get a portion of the ATVM program.

196
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,160
But public approval wouldn't be enough.

197
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,680
At the time, Tesla only had 1,500 cars on the road

198
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,480
and hadn't truly proven that they could produce cars on mass

199
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,400
or significantly reduce emissions.

200
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,600
Tesla was stuck in a catch-22.

201
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
They needed to show they had the support

202
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,520
of other corporate investors,

203
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,880
specifically traditional automakers like Daimler,

204
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,760
the makers of Mercedes and other cars,

205
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,080
but Daimler wouldn't be interested in investing

206
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
if they didn't get the loan.

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,400
He'd announced that the loan was approved

208
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,280
before Tesla had even submitted

209
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,200
a complete application for the loan,

210
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,520
let alone received any kind of actual approval for it.

211
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,600
By saying that this was a done deal,

212
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,400
that gave Daimler the confidence to partner with them.

213
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,200
And having that partnership with a century old,

214
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,080
one of the biggest names in the car business,

215
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,800
in turn gave the government the confidence

216
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,680
in Tesla's viability to then ultimately give them the loan.

217
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,440
And so it's this circular trick that Elon plays.

218
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,920
It was more than the money.

219
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,120
It was a boost for public and investor relations.

220
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,320
Just a few months later, Tesla registered for an IPO.

221
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,600
Their SEC filing even admits the loan

222
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,320
was essential to the business.

223
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:29,160
In 2013, Tesla paid off the loan in full

224
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,000
to huge fanfare from the media.

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,800
CNN literally just copied their press release,

226
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,080
but Tesla still isn't profitable.

227
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,760
Their stated goal is to accelerate the world's transition

228
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,080
to sustainable energy,

229
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,520
but Tesla's actual strategy is exploiting

230
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,480
well-meaning government climate programs.

231
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,720
Look at carbon credits.

232
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,800
Government permits to emit a certain quantity

233
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,960
of greenhouse gases.

234
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,520
Companies earn carbon credits for reducing emissions

235
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,560
and have to spend them when they emit too much.

236
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,760
Tesla earns a lot, then sells them to other companies,

237
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,960
erasing whatever progress Tesla made.

238
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,800
The boost from selling carbon credits

239
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
led to some of the only profitable quarters

240
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,200
Tesla had ever had.

241
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,360
They even used to list regulatory credits

242
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,320
and automobile sales in the same line in some SEC filings.

243
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,800
It allowed Tesla to announce better financials

244
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,240
and pull in more investors, retail and institutional.

245
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,000
Musk gets paid almost entirely in stock

246
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,320
and he's really good at manipulating the stock's value.

247
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,920
He uses the same strategy he used with Daimler

248
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,360
and the Department of Energy,

249
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,960
announcing funding that might not exist.

250
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,040
Like when he tweeted,

251
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,800
I'm considering taking Tesla private at 420,

252
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
funding secured.

253
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
You can't just do that.

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,080
A federal judge determined Elon's tweet

255
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,760
had falsely inflated Tesla stock

256
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,160
and caused billions in damages.

257
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,480
The COVID pandemic also helped Musk.

258
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
When the Federal Reserve

259
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
executed recession-stalling fixes on Wall Street,

260
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,120
bankers invested in Tesla.

261
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,040
Despite Musk's derision of COVID stimulus checks,

262
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,760
Tesla received stimulus money from the government.

263
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,280
At the beginning of the pandemic,

264
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,120
Tesla stock hovered around $120 a share.

265
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,160
In late 2021, a year and a half into COVID,

266
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,240
it was worth 10 times that,

267
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,320
all of which greatly increased the net worth

268
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,600
of the top shareholder, Elon.

269
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,480
But to maintain the world-saving myth,

270
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,920
he has to look like he doesn't make any money.

271
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,400
My cash balances are very, very low.

272
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,880
I simply had loans against my stock,

273
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,000
so if Tesla's SpaceX went bankrupt,

274
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,400
I would go bankrupt too.

275
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,880
Most U.S. companies don't allow their executives

276
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,840
to take out loans against their stock,

277
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,200
but Tesla does, and Musk has taken advantage,

278
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,280
borrowing millions of dollars for his personal coffers,

279
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,480
using his Tesla stock as collateral.

280
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,120
Loans don't count as income

281
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,200
in the eyes of the IRS or the public.

282
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,080
But even without the loans,

283
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,080
in 2021, Musk made 18,043 times the average Tesla employee.

284
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,440
Tesla justifies that wild ratio to investors in SEC filings

285
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,560
by arguing Elon's worth it.

286
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,720
Elon Musk has contributed significantly

287
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,040
and actively to us since our earliest days,

288
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,320
raising capital, bringing investors,

289
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,280
and raising public awareness.

290
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,960
Yeah, Tesla's own SEC filings admit

291
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,080
that the myth of Elon is inherently tied

292
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,520
to the value of the company.

293
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,280
If people stop believing in Elon, Tesla loses value,

294
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,600
and Elon knows that.

295
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,920
He even admits much of Tesla's value

296
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,560
is based on a promise.

297
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,880
The overwhelming focus is solving full self-driving.

298
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
That's really the difference between Tesla

299
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,640
being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.

300
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,720
But full self-driving has yet to be safely implemented,

301
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,680
and the latest data suggests it's incredibly unsafe.

302
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,280
Tesla's system is nowhere near ready.

303
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,880
Regardless, Musk is still wildly wealthy

304
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,320
from the promises he's made,

305
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
and that's also made him very powerful.

306
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,800
Elon says his goal is...

307
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,800
We want to maximize happiness to the population

308
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,320
and propagate into the future as far as possible.

309
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,800
But he's really using that wealth and power

310
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,280
as all billionaires do.

311
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,800
Not to save humanity, but to crush it.

312
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,720
He squashes worker power.

313
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,480
They fired me because I tried to improve the lives

314
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,040
of my coworkers and myself.

315
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,200
That's why they fired me,

316
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,760
because it wasn't a part of Elon's plan.

317
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,480
And now that he has both power and a soapbox,

318
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,920
his dangerous anti-government political beliefs

319
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,480
are even more important.

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,920
Previously, Elon was a liberal darling.

321
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,920
Obama's 2015 State of the Union

322
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,320
seemed to be written for Musk.

323
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,640
Solar power at Tesla.

324
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,640
Re-energized space program astronauts to Mars.

325
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,840
But as soon as Democrats questioned Musk, he changed,

326
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,440
lashing out and announcing support

327
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,640
for far-right figures and ideas.

328
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,200
He likes the politicians willing to support his myth

329
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,760
and let him continue building wealth

330
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,560
at the expense of the rest of us.

331
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,800
He isn't the only billionaire doing this,

332
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,160
but his skill at myth-building

333
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,400
and his massive popularity make him the most dangerous.

334
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,760
Musk tells a story of a self-made billionaire

335
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,480
using his money to save the world and enrich humanity.

336
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,000
But he really built his wealth

337
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,600
on the backs of others to enrich himself.

338
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360

and multimillionaires to examine the policy failures

342
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,640
that made them rich,
