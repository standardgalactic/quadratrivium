0	4240	I'm about to say something that you would never expect to hear from more perfect union.
5120	7600	Elon Musk is right about something.
7600	10080	Elon Musk is suing the maker of chat, GPT,
10080	14160	suing open AI, suing open AI for breach of contract
14160	16800	by putting profit ahead of benefiting humanity.
16800	22560	Elon's lawsuit against open AI, the most recognizable developer of artificial intelligence,
22560	26800	was big news. But when I heard it, I was a bit confused.
26800	29520	When has Elon ever been against profit?
29520	37040	So I dug it. I read and I watched far too much of these guys talking about AI.
37040	41920	I think that AI will be a technological revolution on the scale of the agricultural,
41920	43520	the industrial, the computer revolution.
43520	50000	AI is about to revolutionize digital biology and genomics and transportation and retail.
50000	54320	Artificial intelligence, this is, it is a renaissance.
54320	58400	This is a world-changing set of advances.
58480	63040	By the time these lawsuits are decided, we'll have digital god, so digital god.
63040	67600	I noticed three things. That the rise of AI is inevitable.
67600	70400	That it will change everything about our lives.
71120	77520	And that there's a war brewing between a handful of billionaires to seize control of it.
78320	84800	Nvidia became one of the most valuable stocks of all time producing chips for AI.
84800	90560	Microsoft reached an over $3 trillion valuation based on its AI work.
90560	94240	And open AI tripled in value in just 10 months.
94880	102960	But where do we, you, and I, and everyone other than the dozen or so billionaires duking it out
102960	108960	for control fit in? We're already seeing plans to replace human nurses with AI.
108960	113360	Media magnates killing jobs to focus on cost cutting with AI.
113360	119040	AI written drivel filling the internet. And AI that does karaoke for you.
119760	126800	But let's look at the possible AI future through the rise of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.
126800	131120	And just one contender in the billionaire battle for the future.
132080	141760	Sam Altman is the ruler of Silicon Valley startups. And that's not me saying that. He thinks that.
141760	146080	I think the president of YC is sort of the unofficial leader of the startup movement.
146080	151200	YC is Y Combinator, a significant venture capital firm and tech incubator that Altman
151200	156880	ran from 2014 to 2019. He'd originally connected with YC in 2008.
156880	164400	When the firm funded his app, Looped, when he was 19 years old and wore two popped collars.
164400	170400	Looped was a common Silicon Valley story. They raised a ton of money, gathered a bunch of data,
170400	175040	and got in trouble for texting everyone on your phone when you downloaded the app.
175680	178800	Altman sold the company and it all but disappeared.
179360	184400	Altman landed at Y Combinator where he rose to president in two years.
184400	189200	Under Altman's leadership, Y Combinator invested in massive companies most people have heard of,
189200	196240	like Reddit, Airbnb, Coinbase, Dropbox, Stripe, Twitch, DoorDash, and Instacart.
196880	201040	In a lecture to Stanford computer science students on startups,
201040	203280	Altman quoted Peter Thiel's advice.
203920	208720	As Peter Thiel is going to discuss in the fifth class, you want an idea that turns into a monopoly.
208720	212960	But you can't get a monopoly in a big market right away. You have to find a small market
212960	215360	in which you can get a monopoly and then quickly expand.
215360	220320	Quick expansion is an inherent part of the way venture capital funded tech runs today.
220880	224160	This is Tim O'Reilly. He's been in tech forever.
224160	230960	And if you know phrases like open source or WEM 2.0, it's because he popularized them.
230960	237600	One of the big problems with today's Silicon Valley is that it no longer really supports
237680	243440	remarket competition. Early days of VCD, you were really talking about funding
243440	246640	insurgent companies that had an experimental idea.
247280	250960	Most companies didn't actually raise massive amounts of capital.
250960	253520	But at some point that changed.
253520	260480	But then you fast forward to 2010 in the wake of the look super low interest rates is all this
260480	266720	cheap capital and companies are just buying market share. And I call this the Uber problem.
266880	271280	We didn't see real competition with different business models, different pricing.
271280	276640	We saw two heavily capitalized companies driving everybody else out of business.
277200	282640	By growing rapidly with a bunch of capital, Uber created an ecosystem where if you want
282640	289520	a cab, you need to use Uber. The old system of car services was pretty much pushed out of existence.
289520	295360	Uber is not an Altman company, but DoorDash, Airbnb and other companies that used similar
295360	300400	strategies totally are. In 2015, we get our first hint of open AI.
300400	303520	I actually just agreed to fund a company that is not even really a company,
303520	308320	sort of a semi company, semi nonprofit doing AI safety research.
308320	313760	Open AI is announced as not a company, but a nonprofit focused on AI safety,
314320	320240	funded and supported by Y Combinator, Elon Musk, Reed Hoffman, the LinkedIn guy,
320800	327200	Peter Thiel, Amazon and Infosys. Basically a who's who of the people who built
327200	333840	the broken tech infrastructure of today. The stated goal of open AI was to advance digital
333840	339760	intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, with no shareholders
339760	345200	to be beholden to. We wanted to build this with humanity's best interest at heart.
345200	350880	That doesn't sound too bad, right? A groundbreaking new technology,
350880	354880	its power available to all without any responsibility to shareholders?
355600	360720	But let's dig a little deeper. They say they want to make the world
360720	366320	better and do it safely, but what does that mean to them? Most of what Altman talks about
366320	372720	in regards to what open AI's products can do seems to center on productivity, efficiency
372720	376480	and margin boosting. Our ability to have amazing ideas
377120	381440	for our children to like teach themselves more than ever before for people to be more productive.
381440	386800	How does that make life better for the rest of us? Well, Altman claims to have the answer.
386800	393280	In his essay, Moore's Law for Everything, he explains it would require simply changing the
393280	399840	entire economic system. Altman claims AI would drive down labor costs so everything would get
399840	405360	cheaper. And the lost jobs would be offset by a universal basic income coming from corporate
405360	413920	and property tax rates, with no other taxes. Which sounds great, maybe, but how true is that?
413920	420800	Would corporations see falling labor costs and reduced prices or just keep the profits for themselves?
420800	427280	Would a flat tax and UBI mean more money for working people or more tax cheating by the rich
427280	432640	and social service cuts for everyone else? And there's a running theme through all of what Altman
432640	438800	says, the inevitability and the danger of artificial intelligence. Listen to this clip.
438800	443680	You know, I think AI will probably like most likely sort of lead to the end of the world.
443680	448800	People like Altman benefit from the narrative that AI is this big scary thing,
448800	454560	even as they're the ones trying to build and profit from it. Here's Tim O'Reilly again.
454560	461680	It feels a little bit like a kind of misdirection. They're basically calling for a kind of regulation
461680	469280	of an extreme risk to avoid the regulation of the many proximate harms we can see today.
469280	472720	If they were really afraid of it, they would stop doing their research. Instead,
472720	478080	they're racing to accelerate it so they can get a monopoly. It's a lot like the famous
478080	481600	lion from the Wizard of Oz. It paid no attention to the man behind the curtain.
482240	488400	And a lot of what I spent my time in talking about AI regulation is this. There is a man behind
488400	494880	the curtain or a series of men who are making decisions for their business advantage. And
494880	500240	those are the things that we need to be regulating. Why are they moving fast to break things?
500240	504800	I mean, in the Altman clip from before where he says the world ending thing,
504800	510160	he literally says this right after. You know, I think AI will probably like most likely sort of
510720	515360	lead to the end of the world. But in the meantime, there will be great companies created with
515360	522800	serious machine learning companies. See, it's right back to profit. But hold on, isn't open AI
522800	524960	a nonprofit? Not anymore.
528480	532560	Just three years after the founding of open AI, they transitioned to something they're calling
533280	539040	mixed profit. To do what we needed to go do, we had tried and failed enough to raise the money as
539040	544800	a nonprofit. We didn't see a path forward there. So we needed some of the benefits of capitalism,
544800	551280	but not too much. And the new board of open AI is rife with the profiteers who've been extracting
551280	558160	value from working people for decades. They're also not open. None of this stuff is just simply
558160	565760	available. Sure, an old version of chat DBT is free and kind of fun sometimes. But open AI's real
565760	571920	product is enterprise software doing partnerships with other giant tech companies and loads of
571920	578320	stuff we don't even know about. Defense contracts included. Open AI has a product to sell a product
578320	584480	they see as having inevitable near universal proliferation, which is a pretty damn good business
584480	590320	plan. But it's dangerous for the rest of us. You know what Tim O'Reilly said about the Uber
590320	596400	problem. Here's how it applies to AI. All of the smaller AI firms are already starting to fold
597200	603680	because there are a couple in the form of open AI and Anthropic that are incredibly heavily funded
603680	608960	that have tens of billions of dollars of capital. And we don't know that they're the best companies.
608960	614000	We just know that they're the ones that big investors picked up early. And so we have a
614000	622560	defective kind of market where if you really believe in the wisdom of millions of people
622560	629120	making independent decisions based on optimal information to kind of do work this re-magic
629120	634000	market, we don't have that. We have a central committee of deep-pocketed investors. It all
634000	640160	illuminates Elon's lawsuit against open AI when he and Altman had once been such good friends.
640160	642480	I'm looking for a new video gameplay. Can you give me a recommendation?
642560	644720	Overwatch. After Overwatch. Yes, go else.
647440	654480	I named it open AI after open source. It is in fact closed source. It should be renamed
654480	662080	super closed source for maximum profit AI. But he has his own for sale for profit AI that he
662080	667920	wants to be predominant. He made it open source in a seemingly empty gesture. But
667920	672320	meanwhile, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google all want to take control of the tech
672320	678000	that will change our future and destroy our jobs. It doesn't matter that these guys say
678000	684160	they're doing it for good. It matters what they are actually doing. Look at the DOM of the Internet
684160	692320	itself. Or web 2.0. That's social media and user generated content. All of that seemed great.
692320	697360	And yeah, the modern Internet has obviously had a lot of clear benefits. But it was also
697360	703600	pretty quickly ruined by giant corporations and profit motive. We're already starting to see
703600	709840	effects of the AI power grab. Nvidia, the main producer of the chips used for AI, is partnering
709840	716800	with a company that wants to replace nurses with an AI that costs $9 an hour. Look at anything from
716800	722480	the history of the American medicine industry. Will a new low cost tool actually help patients
722480	728880	or just pad investor pockets? Companies are using AI to do job interviews and it's shutting out
728880	734960	applicants unfairly. And on a simply annoying level, they're spitting out content that's making
734960	742320	the Internet even more unusable than it already was. AI generated LinkedIn comments? Why don't you
742320	748080	just not post anything if you don't have anything to say? So what are we going to do about this?
748880	756480	Well, let's turn to Sam Altman for advice. He has what he calls the more good guys than bad guys
756480	762640	approach. He wrote in that Moore's Law essay, There are bad humans, but all humans are within a
762640	769600	magnitude are as powerful as one another. And the good humans, and together to stop the bad humans.
770240	776000	It's been that way through all of history so far. What if the bad humans are actually the people
776000	782560	building the system? One built entirely on fast profits and monopoly, advancing as quickly as
782560	789360	possible. Then we need more good guys and we've got them. They're like 12 people. What if we all
789360	796480	stand up and say no? When electricity was first becoming widespread, it was still dangerous for
796480	803120	the low paid workers who were setting up the systems. But those workers stood together and formed
803120	807360	the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, that's the Electricians Union,
807360	814480	to demand safer jobs and better wages. It worked and it didn't hamper progress. We clearly have
814480	821280	electricity today, right? That same concept applies to AI too. Remember the writer's strike?
821840	828160	The screenwriter's guild stood up and said no to AI taking their jobs. Senator Bernie Sanders
828160	833600	just introduced legislation for a shorter work week. Do we continue the trend that technology
833600	840640	only benefits the people on top? Or do we demand that these transformational changes benefit working
840640	847760	people? And one of the benefits must be a lower work week. If AI is going to make workers more
847760	854080	productive and labor cheaper, workers should be able to take advantage of it. AI cannot exist
854080	860240	without being trained on all that humanity has done before. That's literally how chat GPT,
860240	866880	the way most people interact with AI, was built by reading a bunch of stuff online and then
866880	874560	synthesizing it so it can talk. If all of this is built on the labor of all of humanity, then
874560	880960	it should be all of humanity that benefits. Thank you so much for watching. If you want to
