00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
I'm no saint, but I generally try to do the right thing.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.840
Are you sincerely trying to save the world?

00:04.840 --> 00:06.440
I'm trying to do good things.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.800
Good idea for an electric jet.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.400
Impossible, no middle name.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.600
Elon Musk has a pretty big pitch.

00:12.600 --> 00:14.840
He's the good billionaire using his wealth

00:14.840 --> 00:16.800
to protect the future of humanity.

00:16.800 --> 00:19.800
It's gotten him something most billionaires don't have,

00:19.800 --> 00:20.720
a fan base.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.960
I've never signed a big, a life-sized version of it.

00:23.960 --> 00:27.200
First, I want to say I love you.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.920
A 2021 poll showed Musk with a 50% approval rating,

00:30.920 --> 00:33.560
way higher than his fellow billionaires.

00:33.560 --> 00:36.320
This popularity has done very well for him.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.840
Musk is now the seventh richest man in the world.

00:38.840 --> 00:41.560
Musk is now the fourth richest man in the world.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.000
Elon Musk is now the world's richest person

00:44.000 --> 00:45.840
again, according to Forbes.

00:45.840 --> 00:48.360
We took a deep look into Musk's entire career,

00:48.360 --> 00:50.880
court documents, SEC filings, and interviews

00:50.880 --> 00:53.320
to break down the story Elon tells about himself

00:53.320 --> 00:56.200
and how he leveraged it to accumulate wealth and power.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.240
This is the classroom from More Perfect Union,

00:58.240 --> 01:01.200
and today we're going to look at how Elon Musk got rich.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.920
Let's skip Musk's South Africa childhood.

01:04.920 --> 01:06.520
Critics say he inherited his money

01:06.520 --> 01:07.840
from his father's emerald mine,

01:07.840 --> 01:10.000
and Elon says that's not true.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.240
He claims he rejected his abusive father's

01:12.240 --> 01:14.800
ill-begotten wealth and came to North America as a teen

01:14.800 --> 01:17.280
with $2,000 to put himself through college.

01:17.280 --> 01:19.360
He knew he wanted to work with the internet.

01:19.360 --> 01:21.360
The only way to get involved with the internet in 95

01:21.360 --> 01:23.640
that I could think of was to start a company,

01:23.640 --> 01:25.120
because they weren't a lot of companies to go and work for.

01:25.120 --> 01:27.280
So I thought, well, we've got to make something

01:27.280 --> 01:29.600
that's going to return money very, very quickly.

01:29.600 --> 01:32.640
Elon joined forces and funds with his brother Kimball.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.520
They drummed up some cash from investors,

01:34.520 --> 01:36.400
including $20K from their father,

01:36.400 --> 01:39.560
and started Zip2, a map and local listing company.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.280
Zip2 eventually planned to merge with CitySearch,

01:42.280 --> 01:44.520
but Elon wouldn't have been in charge.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.880
That did not sit well with him.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.120
At the time, a CitySearch executive said

01:49.120 --> 01:52.120
CitySearch wanted to focus on customers and financiers,

01:52.120 --> 01:55.080
while Musk wanted to focus on general visibility.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.680
Visibility for him.

01:56.680 --> 01:58.360
I'd like to be on the cover of Rolling Stone.

01:58.360 --> 01:59.640
That'd be cool.

01:59.640 --> 02:02.520
These disagreements led to the deal falling apart.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.200
This is a pattern for Elon,

02:04.200 --> 02:06.440
a need for sole credit and control.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.480
It's a huge part of his story.

02:08.480 --> 02:11.920
Zip2 sold and Elon made $22 million,

02:11.920 --> 02:14.080
which he invested in his next project.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.520
I've sunk the great majority of my net worth

02:16.520 --> 02:17.560
into Axe.com,

02:17.560 --> 02:20.240
which is the new banking and mutual funds company.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.520
So this is an ATM.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.360
And what we're going to do

02:22.360 --> 02:24.920
is transform the traditional banking industry.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.360
That quote defines Musk's strategy,

02:27.360 --> 02:29.080
promise revolutionary technology

02:29.080 --> 02:31.440
and highlight how he's risking his own money.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.360
And he also points out a key element of his success,

02:34.360 --> 02:35.760
wooing investors.

02:35.760 --> 02:37.600
Raising $50 million is a matter

02:37.600 --> 02:39.560
of making a series of phone calls.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.440
As Axe.com took shape,

02:41.440 --> 02:43.440
investors and the board didn't think Musk

02:43.440 --> 02:45.280
had the experience to be CEO.

02:45.280 --> 02:47.120
So they brought in Bill Harris.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.400
Elon's co-founders were also unhappy.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.280
One accused him of promising the sun,

02:51.280 --> 02:52.880
moon and the stars to the media

02:52.880 --> 02:54.440
when there was nothing there.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.480
Future SEC filings for the company

02:56.480 --> 02:58.760
even mentioned a lack of proprietary technology

02:58.760 --> 03:00.080
as a corporate risk.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.440
The tech they did have was problematic.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.840
For example, there was a bug allowing bad actors

03:04.840 --> 03:06.520
to transfer funds from any account

03:06.520 --> 03:07.880
in the nation's banking system

03:07.880 --> 03:09.520
with just an account number,

03:09.520 --> 03:11.320
a major security flaw.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.400
A co-founder was so displeased with Musk,

03:13.400 --> 03:15.640
he left and took many employees with him.

03:15.640 --> 03:18.200
Musk's reaction, we'll hire more people.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.760
Eventually Musk pushed out CEO Bill Harris

03:20.760 --> 03:23.080
and replaced him with himself

03:23.080 --> 03:24.680
to centralize authority.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.720
X.com merged with a competitor,

03:27.720 --> 03:29.360
Peter Teal's Confinity.

03:29.360 --> 03:32.480
Confinity owned a piece of technology called PayPal.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.960
Musk and Teal got glowing press coverage,

03:34.960 --> 03:37.200
but because PayPal came out of Confinity,

03:37.200 --> 03:39.200
a lot of the coverage centered Teal.

03:39.200 --> 03:42.120
According to Ashley Vance's 2015 biography,

03:42.120 --> 03:44.760
Musk kept championing the X.com brand

03:44.760 --> 03:47.160
while most everyone else favored PayPal.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.520
Eventually the company scrapped X.com to focus on PayPal,

03:50.520 --> 03:52.920
a decision the press gave Musk credit for.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.760
But mutiny was brewing.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.400
Executive Rolof Botha alleged Musk was hiding

03:57.400 --> 03:59.520
serious financial issues from the board.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.480
Employees put together a coup.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.560
They petitioned the board to fire Musk and it worked.

04:04.560 --> 04:07.040
Musk was fired and replaced with Teal.

04:07.040 --> 04:09.120
Botha said it was just in time.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.520
It would have killed the company

04:10.520 --> 04:13.680
if Elon had stayed on as CEO for six more months.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.440
Regardless, Musk hits it big

04:15.440 --> 04:19.280
when PayPal eventually sells, $180 million.

04:19.280 --> 04:22.520
He had been laying the path for his next move since college.

04:22.600 --> 04:24.120
When I was in college, there were three areas

04:24.120 --> 04:26.000
that I thought would most affect the future of humanity.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.480
The internet, the transition to a sustainable energy

04:28.480 --> 04:31.360
and transportation sector, and space exploration,

04:31.360 --> 04:33.720
and particularly the extension of life to multiple planets.

04:33.720 --> 04:36.560
With the capital that I got from the sale of PayPal,

04:36.560 --> 04:39.040
I was able to go into both those areas.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.120
Enter SpaceX and Tesla.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.440
Musk wasn't with Tesla at the start.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.080
He invested in a company that already existed,

04:46.080 --> 04:48.720
but most media calls him a founder.

04:48.720 --> 04:49.840
What happened?

04:49.840 --> 04:51.720
We spoke with Edward Niedermeyer,

04:51.720 --> 04:52.920
author of Ludacris,

04:52.920 --> 04:55.520
an in-depth examination of Tesla Motors.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.200
Elon Musk was not one of the original founders of Tesla,

04:58.200 --> 04:59.040
right?

04:59.040 --> 04:59.960
There was these two guys, Martin Neighborhart

04:59.960 --> 05:01.920
and Mark Tarpening, who had actually incorporated

05:01.920 --> 05:03.080
the company.

05:03.080 --> 05:05.560
Musk came in because he wanted to do the same thing.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.520
But like with his previous companies,

05:07.520 --> 05:09.440
Elon was focused on publicity,

05:09.440 --> 05:12.040
specifically public perception of himself

05:12.040 --> 05:13.480
as the visionary founder.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.360
Part and parcel of being a hot startup, right?

05:15.360 --> 05:17.800
Is you have to have that sort of charismatic

05:17.800 --> 05:20.520
visionary founder, but it wasn't Elon Musk.

05:20.520 --> 05:21.840
It was Martin Neighborhart.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.080
Neighborhart even had a BlackBerry ad

05:24.080 --> 05:26.240
where he's being presented just like Steve Jobs

05:26.240 --> 05:27.920
as this visionary tech guy.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.920
And I think that was exactly the kind of thing

05:29.920 --> 05:33.160
that Elon Musk really wanted out of Tesla

05:33.160 --> 05:34.280
as much as anything else.

05:34.280 --> 05:36.920
He sent an email saying, like, this is embarrassing.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.640
You know, I'm an important part of this company

05:39.640 --> 05:41.960
and I want to make sure that I'm included in the coverage.

05:41.960 --> 05:44.960
And in these emails that leaked it, it makes it very clear

05:44.960 --> 05:46.080
that being that guy,

05:46.080 --> 05:48.880
being the visionary figurehead of this company

05:48.880 --> 05:51.680
was really, really important to him.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.800
So shortly after this whole exchange

05:53.800 --> 05:56.360
and Musk getting really angry about his lack of prominence

05:56.360 --> 05:57.840
in the media coverage,

05:57.840 --> 06:01.520
he went and wrote the top secret master plan blog post.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.000
And this was really Musk's coming out party,

06:04.000 --> 06:07.160
positioning himself as really that visionary founder

06:07.160 --> 06:08.320
for Tesla.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.040
One of the really interesting things is that,

06:11.040 --> 06:12.320
you know, there's really not a lot

06:12.320 --> 06:16.320
in the top secret master plan strategically anyway,

06:16.320 --> 06:18.640
that Tesla wasn't kind of already planning on doing.

06:18.680 --> 06:20.880
It all culminated in Aberhard's ouster

06:20.880 --> 06:23.440
and a series of lawsuits leading to a settlement

06:23.440 --> 06:25.160
with an important stipulation.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.640
Musk could legally call himself a co-founder of the company.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.840
Musk knew that to acquire more power,

06:30.840 --> 06:33.360
he needed to be called co-founder on paper.

06:33.360 --> 06:37.040
Musk has long insisted he never wanted to be CEO of Tesla.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.160
But after Aberhard's ouster,

06:39.160 --> 06:42.400
they brought in, you know, two different new CEOs

06:42.400 --> 06:45.120
before Musk himself eventually took over.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.040
Musk took over at a rough time,

06:47.040 --> 06:49.320
the 2008 financial crisis.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.520
Tesla needed an influx of capital.

06:51.520 --> 06:53.680
Musk's usual strategies wouldn't work.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.600
The sources of capital that would normally provide that,

06:55.600 --> 06:58.440
such as the public markets, the debt markets,

06:58.440 --> 06:59.520
they're in shambles.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.840
But a year earlier,

07:00.840 --> 07:03.920
Congress passed a $25 billion loan program

07:03.920 --> 07:05.320
for the Department of Energy,

07:05.320 --> 07:08.240
part of which would go to developing low-emission cars.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.120
Musk went on a media blitz trying to convince the public

07:11.120 --> 07:12.760
that Tesla deserved the loan.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.120
It's helpful to let your congressman center know

07:15.120 --> 07:16.520
that you think companies like Tesla

07:16.520 --> 07:19.480
should get a portion of the ATVM program.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.160
But public approval wouldn't be enough.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.680
At the time, Tesla only had 1,500 cars on the road

07:25.680 --> 07:28.480
and hadn't truly proven that they could produce cars on mass

07:28.480 --> 07:30.400
or significantly reduce emissions.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.600
Tesla was stuck in a catch-22.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.200
They needed to show they had the support

07:34.200 --> 07:35.520
of other corporate investors,

07:35.520 --> 07:37.880
specifically traditional automakers like Daimler,

07:37.880 --> 07:39.760
the makers of Mercedes and other cars,

07:39.760 --> 07:42.080
but Daimler wouldn't be interested in investing

07:42.080 --> 07:43.360
if they didn't get the loan.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.400
He'd announced that the loan was approved

07:45.400 --> 07:47.280
before Tesla had even submitted

07:47.280 --> 07:50.200
a complete application for the loan,

07:50.200 --> 07:53.520
let alone received any kind of actual approval for it.

07:53.520 --> 07:55.600
By saying that this was a done deal,

07:55.600 --> 07:58.400
that gave Daimler the confidence to partner with them.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.200
And having that partnership with a century old,

08:01.200 --> 08:03.080
one of the biggest names in the car business,

08:03.080 --> 08:05.800
in turn gave the government the confidence

08:05.800 --> 08:09.680
in Tesla's viability to then ultimately give them the loan.

08:09.680 --> 08:14.440
And so it's this circular trick that Elon plays.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.920
It was more than the money.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.120
It was a boost for public and investor relations.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.320
Just a few months later, Tesla registered for an IPO.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.600
Their SEC filing even admits the loan

08:24.600 --> 08:26.320
was essential to the business.

08:26.320 --> 08:29.160
In 2013, Tesla paid off the loan in full

08:29.160 --> 08:31.000
to huge fanfare from the media.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.800
CNN literally just copied their press release,

08:33.800 --> 08:36.080
but Tesla still isn't profitable.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.760
Their stated goal is to accelerate the world's transition

08:38.760 --> 08:40.080
to sustainable energy,

08:40.080 --> 08:42.520
but Tesla's actual strategy is exploiting

08:42.520 --> 08:44.480
well-meaning government climate programs.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.720
Look at carbon credits.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.800
Government permits to emit a certain quantity

08:47.800 --> 08:48.960
of greenhouse gases.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.520
Companies earn carbon credits for reducing emissions

08:51.520 --> 08:53.560
and have to spend them when they emit too much.

08:53.560 --> 08:56.760
Tesla earns a lot, then sells them to other companies,

08:56.760 --> 08:58.960
erasing whatever progress Tesla made.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.800
The boost from selling carbon credits

09:00.800 --> 09:02.880
led to some of the only profitable quarters

09:02.880 --> 09:04.200
Tesla had ever had.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.360
They even used to list regulatory credits

09:06.360 --> 09:10.320
and automobile sales in the same line in some SEC filings.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.800
It allowed Tesla to announce better financials

09:12.800 --> 09:16.240
and pull in more investors, retail and institutional.

09:16.240 --> 09:19.000
Musk gets paid almost entirely in stock

09:19.000 --> 09:22.320
and he's really good at manipulating the stock's value.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.920
He uses the same strategy he used with Daimler

09:24.920 --> 09:26.360
and the Department of Energy,

09:26.360 --> 09:28.960
announcing funding that might not exist.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.040
Like when he tweeted,

09:30.040 --> 09:32.800
I'm considering taking Tesla private at 420,

09:32.800 --> 09:34.200
funding secured.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.000
You can't just do that.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.080
A federal judge determined Elon's tweet

09:38.080 --> 09:39.760
had falsely inflated Tesla stock

09:39.760 --> 09:42.160
and caused billions in damages.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.480
The COVID pandemic also helped Musk.

09:44.480 --> 09:45.680
When the Federal Reserve

09:45.680 --> 09:48.240
executed recession-stalling fixes on Wall Street,

09:48.240 --> 09:50.120
bankers invested in Tesla.

09:50.120 --> 09:53.040
Despite Musk's derision of COVID stimulus checks,

09:53.040 --> 09:55.760
Tesla received stimulus money from the government.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.280
At the beginning of the pandemic,

09:57.280 --> 10:00.120
Tesla stock hovered around $120 a share.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.160
In late 2021, a year and a half into COVID,

10:03.160 --> 10:05.240
it was worth 10 times that,

10:05.240 --> 10:07.320
all of which greatly increased the net worth

10:07.320 --> 10:09.600
of the top shareholder, Elon.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.480
But to maintain the world-saving myth,

10:11.480 --> 10:13.920
he has to look like he doesn't make any money.

10:13.920 --> 10:16.400
My cash balances are very, very low.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.880
I simply had loans against my stock,

10:18.880 --> 10:22.000
so if Tesla's SpaceX went bankrupt,

10:22.000 --> 10:23.400
I would go bankrupt too.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.880
Most U.S. companies don't allow their executives

10:25.880 --> 10:27.840
to take out loans against their stock,

10:27.840 --> 10:31.200
but Tesla does, and Musk has taken advantage,

10:31.200 --> 10:34.280
borrowing millions of dollars for his personal coffers,

10:34.280 --> 10:36.480
using his Tesla stock as collateral.

10:36.480 --> 10:38.120
Loans don't count as income

10:38.120 --> 10:40.200
in the eyes of the IRS or the public.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.080
But even without the loans,

10:42.080 --> 10:47.080
in 2021, Musk made 18,043 times the average Tesla employee.

10:47.680 --> 10:51.440
Tesla justifies that wild ratio to investors in SEC filings

10:51.440 --> 10:53.560
by arguing Elon's worth it.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.720
Elon Musk has contributed significantly

10:55.720 --> 10:58.040
and actively to us since our earliest days,

10:58.040 --> 11:00.320
raising capital, bringing investors,

11:00.320 --> 11:02.280
and raising public awareness.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.960
Yeah, Tesla's own SEC filings admit

11:04.960 --> 11:07.080
that the myth of Elon is inherently tied

11:07.080 --> 11:08.520
to the value of the company.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.280
If people stop believing in Elon, Tesla loses value,

11:12.280 --> 11:13.600
and Elon knows that.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.920
He even admits much of Tesla's value

11:15.920 --> 11:17.560
is based on a promise.

11:17.560 --> 11:20.880
The overwhelming focus is solving full self-driving.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.040
That's really the difference between Tesla

11:23.040 --> 11:25.640
being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.720
But full self-driving has yet to be safely implemented,

11:28.720 --> 11:31.680
and the latest data suggests it's incredibly unsafe.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.280
Tesla's system is nowhere near ready.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.880
Regardless, Musk is still wildly wealthy

11:36.880 --> 11:38.320
from the promises he's made,

11:38.320 --> 11:41.120
and that's also made him very powerful.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.800
Elon says his goal is...

11:42.800 --> 11:47.800
We want to maximize happiness to the population

11:47.800 --> 11:50.320
and propagate into the future as far as possible.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.800
But he's really using that wealth and power

11:52.800 --> 11:54.280
as all billionaires do.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.800
Not to save humanity, but to crush it.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.720
He squashes worker power.

11:58.720 --> 12:01.480
They fired me because I tried to improve the lives

12:01.480 --> 12:03.040
of my coworkers and myself.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.200
That's why they fired me,

12:04.200 --> 12:05.760
because it wasn't a part of Elon's plan.

12:05.760 --> 12:08.480
And now that he has both power and a soapbox,

12:08.480 --> 12:10.920
his dangerous anti-government political beliefs

12:10.920 --> 12:12.480
are even more important.

12:12.480 --> 12:14.920
Previously, Elon was a liberal darling.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.920
Obama's 2015 State of the Union

12:16.920 --> 12:18.320
seemed to be written for Musk.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.640
Solar power at Tesla.

12:19.640 --> 12:22.640
Re-energized space program astronauts to Mars.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.840
But as soon as Democrats questioned Musk, he changed,

12:25.840 --> 12:27.440
lashing out and announcing support

12:27.440 --> 12:29.640
for far-right figures and ideas.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.200
He likes the politicians willing to support his myth

12:32.200 --> 12:33.760
and let him continue building wealth

12:33.760 --> 12:35.560
at the expense of the rest of us.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.800
He isn't the only billionaire doing this,

12:37.800 --> 12:39.160
but his skill at myth-building

12:39.160 --> 12:42.400
and his massive popularity make him the most dangerous.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.760
Musk tells a story of a self-made billionaire

12:44.760 --> 12:47.480
using his money to save the world and enrich humanity.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.000
But he really built his wealth

12:49.000 --> 12:51.600
on the backs of others to enrich himself.

We'll be covering the stories of other billionaires

12:57.240 --> 12:59.720
and multimillionaires to examine the policy failures

12:59.720 --> 13:00.640
that made them rich,

13:00.640 --> 13:02.520
as well as the worker-empowering stories

13:02.520 --> 13:04.080
and explainers you're used to.
