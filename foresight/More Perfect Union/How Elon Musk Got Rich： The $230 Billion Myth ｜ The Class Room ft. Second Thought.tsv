0	2920	I'm no saint, but I generally try to do the right thing.
2920	4840	Are you sincerely trying to save the world?
4840	6440	I'm trying to do good things.
6440	7800	Good idea for an electric jet.
7800	10400	Impossible, no middle name.
10400	12600	Elon Musk has a pretty big pitch.
12600	14840	He's the good billionaire using his wealth
14840	16800	to protect the future of humanity.
16800	19800	It's gotten him something most billionaires don't have,
19800	20720	a fan base.
20720	23960	I've never signed a big, a life-sized version of it.
23960	27200	First, I want to say I love you.
27200	30920	A 2021 poll showed Musk with a 50% approval rating,
30920	33560	way higher than his fellow billionaires.
33560	36320	This popularity has done very well for him.
36320	38840	Musk is now the seventh richest man in the world.
38840	41560	Musk is now the fourth richest man in the world.
41560	44000	Elon Musk is now the world's richest person
44000	45840	again, according to Forbes.
45840	48360	We took a deep look into Musk's entire career,
48360	50880	court documents, SEC filings, and interviews
50880	53320	to break down the story Elon tells about himself
53320	56200	and how he leveraged it to accumulate wealth and power.
56200	58240	This is the classroom from More Perfect Union,
58240	61200	and today we're going to look at how Elon Musk got rich.
62400	64920	Let's skip Musk's South Africa childhood.
64920	66520	Critics say he inherited his money
66520	67840	from his father's emerald mine,
67840	70000	and Elon says that's not true.
70000	72240	He claims he rejected his abusive father's
72240	74800	ill-begotten wealth and came to North America as a teen
74800	77280	with $2,000 to put himself through college.
77280	79360	He knew he wanted to work with the internet.
79360	81360	The only way to get involved with the internet in 95
81360	83640	that I could think of was to start a company,
83640	85120	because they weren't a lot of companies to go and work for.
85120	87280	So I thought, well, we've got to make something
87280	89600	that's going to return money very, very quickly.
89600	92640	Elon joined forces and funds with his brother Kimball.
92640	94520	They drummed up some cash from investors,
94520	96400	including $20K from their father,
96400	99560	and started Zip2, a map and local listing company.
99560	102280	Zip2 eventually planned to merge with CitySearch,
102280	104520	but Elon wouldn't have been in charge.
104520	106880	That did not sit well with him.
106880	109120	At the time, a CitySearch executive said
109120	112120	CitySearch wanted to focus on customers and financiers,
112120	115080	while Musk wanted to focus on general visibility.
115080	116680	Visibility for him.
116680	118360	I'd like to be on the cover of Rolling Stone.
118360	119640	That'd be cool.
119640	122520	These disagreements led to the deal falling apart.
122520	124200	This is a pattern for Elon,
124200	126440	a need for sole credit and control.
126440	128480	It's a huge part of his story.
128480	131920	Zip2 sold and Elon made $22 million,
131920	134080	which he invested in his next project.
134080	136520	I've sunk the great majority of my net worth
136520	137560	into Axe.com,
137560	140240	which is the new banking and mutual funds company.
140240	141520	So this is an ATM.
141520	142360	And what we're going to do
142360	144920	is transform the traditional banking industry.
144920	147360	That quote defines Musk's strategy,
147360	149080	promise revolutionary technology
149080	151440	and highlight how he's risking his own money.
151440	154360	And he also points out a key element of his success,
154360	155760	wooing investors.
155760	157600	Raising $50 million is a matter
157600	159560	of making a series of phone calls.
159560	161440	As Axe.com took shape,
161440	163440	investors and the board didn't think Musk
163440	165280	had the experience to be CEO.
165280	167120	So they brought in Bill Harris.
167120	169400	Elon's co-founders were also unhappy.
169400	171280	One accused him of promising the sun,
171280	172880	moon and the stars to the media
172880	174440	when there was nothing there.
174440	176480	Future SEC filings for the company
176480	178760	even mentioned a lack of proprietary technology
178760	180080	as a corporate risk.
180080	182440	The tech they did have was problematic.
182440	184840	For example, there was a bug allowing bad actors
184840	186520	to transfer funds from any account
186520	187880	in the nation's banking system
187880	189520	with just an account number,
189520	191320	a major security flaw.
191320	193400	A co-founder was so displeased with Musk,
193400	195640	he left and took many employees with him.
195640	198200	Musk's reaction, we'll hire more people.
198200	200760	Eventually Musk pushed out CEO Bill Harris
200760	203080	and replaced him with himself
203080	204680	to centralize authority.
205520	207720	X.com merged with a competitor,
207720	209360	Peter Teal's Confinity.
209360	212480	Confinity owned a piece of technology called PayPal.
212480	214960	Musk and Teal got glowing press coverage,
214960	217200	but because PayPal came out of Confinity,
217200	219200	a lot of the coverage centered Teal.
219200	222120	According to Ashley Vance's 2015 biography,
222120	224760	Musk kept championing the X.com brand
224760	227160	while most everyone else favored PayPal.
227160	230520	Eventually the company scrapped X.com to focus on PayPal,
230520	232920	a decision the press gave Musk credit for.
232920	234760	But mutiny was brewing.
234760	237400	Executive Rolof Botha alleged Musk was hiding
237400	239520	serious financial issues from the board.
239520	241480	Employees put together a coup.
241480	244560	They petitioned the board to fire Musk and it worked.
244560	247040	Musk was fired and replaced with Teal.
247040	249120	Botha said it was just in time.
249120	250520	It would have killed the company
250520	253680	if Elon had stayed on as CEO for six more months.
253680	255440	Regardless, Musk hits it big
255440	259280	when PayPal eventually sells, $180 million.
259280	262520	He had been laying the path for his next move since college.
262600	264120	When I was in college, there were three areas
264120	266000	that I thought would most affect the future of humanity.
266000	268480	The internet, the transition to a sustainable energy
268480	271360	and transportation sector, and space exploration,
271360	273720	and particularly the extension of life to multiple planets.
273720	276560	With the capital that I got from the sale of PayPal,
276560	279040	I was able to go into both those areas.
279040	281120	Enter SpaceX and Tesla.
281120	283440	Musk wasn't with Tesla at the start.
283440	286080	He invested in a company that already existed,
286080	288720	but most media calls him a founder.
288720	289840	What happened?
289840	291720	We spoke with Edward Niedermeyer,
291720	292920	author of Ludacris,
292920	295520	an in-depth examination of Tesla Motors.
295520	298200	Elon Musk was not one of the original founders of Tesla,
298200	299040	right?
299040	299960	There was these two guys, Martin Neighborhart
299960	301920	and Mark Tarpening, who had actually incorporated
301920	303080	the company.
303080	305560	Musk came in because he wanted to do the same thing.
305560	307520	But like with his previous companies,
307520	309440	Elon was focused on publicity,
309440	312040	specifically public perception of himself
312040	313480	as the visionary founder.
313480	315360	Part and parcel of being a hot startup, right?
315360	317800	Is you have to have that sort of charismatic
317800	320520	visionary founder, but it wasn't Elon Musk.
320520	321840	It was Martin Neighborhart.
321840	324080	Neighborhart even had a BlackBerry ad
324080	326240	where he's being presented just like Steve Jobs
326240	327920	as this visionary tech guy.
327920	329920	And I think that was exactly the kind of thing
329920	333160	that Elon Musk really wanted out of Tesla
333160	334280	as much as anything else.
334280	336920	He sent an email saying, like, this is embarrassing.
336920	339640	You know, I'm an important part of this company
339640	341960	and I want to make sure that I'm included in the coverage.
341960	344960	And in these emails that leaked it, it makes it very clear
344960	346080	that being that guy,
346080	348880	being the visionary figurehead of this company
348880	351680	was really, really important to him.
351680	353800	So shortly after this whole exchange
353800	356360	and Musk getting really angry about his lack of prominence
356360	357840	in the media coverage,
357840	361520	he went and wrote the top secret master plan blog post.
361520	364000	And this was really Musk's coming out party,
364000	367160	positioning himself as really that visionary founder
367160	368320	for Tesla.
368320	371040	One of the really interesting things is that,
371040	372320	you know, there's really not a lot
372320	376320	in the top secret master plan strategically anyway,
376320	378640	that Tesla wasn't kind of already planning on doing.
378680	380880	It all culminated in Aberhard's ouster
380880	383440	and a series of lawsuits leading to a settlement
383440	385160	with an important stipulation.
385160	388640	Musk could legally call himself a co-founder of the company.
388640	390840	Musk knew that to acquire more power,
390840	393360	he needed to be called co-founder on paper.
393360	397040	Musk has long insisted he never wanted to be CEO of Tesla.
397040	399160	But after Aberhard's ouster,
399160	402400	they brought in, you know, two different new CEOs
402400	405120	before Musk himself eventually took over.
405120	407040	Musk took over at a rough time,
407040	409320	the 2008 financial crisis.
409320	411520	Tesla needed an influx of capital.
411520	413680	Musk's usual strategies wouldn't work.
413680	415600	The sources of capital that would normally provide that,
415600	418440	such as the public markets, the debt markets,
418440	419520	they're in shambles.
419520	420840	But a year earlier,
420840	423920	Congress passed a $25 billion loan program
423920	425320	for the Department of Energy,
425320	428240	part of which would go to developing low-emission cars.
428240	431120	Musk went on a media blitz trying to convince the public
431120	432760	that Tesla deserved the loan.
432760	435120	It's helpful to let your congressman center know
435120	436520	that you think companies like Tesla
436520	439480	should get a portion of the ATVM program.
439480	442160	But public approval wouldn't be enough.
442160	445680	At the time, Tesla only had 1,500 cars on the road
445680	448480	and hadn't truly proven that they could produce cars on mass
448480	450400	or significantly reduce emissions.
450400	452600	Tesla was stuck in a catch-22.
452600	454200	They needed to show they had the support
454200	455520	of other corporate investors,
455520	457880	specifically traditional automakers like Daimler,
457880	459760	the makers of Mercedes and other cars,
459760	462080	but Daimler wouldn't be interested in investing
462080	463360	if they didn't get the loan.
463360	465400	He'd announced that the loan was approved
465400	467280	before Tesla had even submitted
467280	470200	a complete application for the loan,
470200	473520	let alone received any kind of actual approval for it.
473520	475600	By saying that this was a done deal,
475600	478400	that gave Daimler the confidence to partner with them.
478400	481200	And having that partnership with a century old,
481200	483080	one of the biggest names in the car business,
483080	485800	in turn gave the government the confidence
485800	489680	in Tesla's viability to then ultimately give them the loan.
489680	494440	And so it's this circular trick that Elon plays.
494440	495920	It was more than the money.
495920	499120	It was a boost for public and investor relations.
499120	502320	Just a few months later, Tesla registered for an IPO.
502320	504600	Their SEC filing even admits the loan
504600	506320	was essential to the business.
506320	509160	In 2013, Tesla paid off the loan in full
509160	511000	to huge fanfare from the media.
511000	513800	CNN literally just copied their press release,
513800	516080	but Tesla still isn't profitable.
516080	518760	Their stated goal is to accelerate the world's transition
518760	520080	to sustainable energy,
520080	522520	but Tesla's actual strategy is exploiting
522520	524480	well-meaning government climate programs.
524480	525720	Look at carbon credits.
525720	527800	Government permits to emit a certain quantity
527800	528960	of greenhouse gases.
528960	531520	Companies earn carbon credits for reducing emissions
531520	533560	and have to spend them when they emit too much.
533560	536760	Tesla earns a lot, then sells them to other companies,
536760	538960	erasing whatever progress Tesla made.
538960	540800	The boost from selling carbon credits
540800	542880	led to some of the only profitable quarters
542880	544200	Tesla had ever had.
544200	546360	They even used to list regulatory credits
546360	550320	and automobile sales in the same line in some SEC filings.
550320	552800	It allowed Tesla to announce better financials
552800	556240	and pull in more investors, retail and institutional.
556240	559000	Musk gets paid almost entirely in stock
559000	562320	and he's really good at manipulating the stock's value.
562320	564920	He uses the same strategy he used with Daimler
564920	566360	and the Department of Energy,
566360	568960	announcing funding that might not exist.
568960	570040	Like when he tweeted,
570040	572800	I'm considering taking Tesla private at 420,
572800	574200	funding secured.
574200	576000	You can't just do that.
576000	578080	A federal judge determined Elon's tweet
578080	579760	had falsely inflated Tesla stock
579760	582160	and caused billions in damages.
582160	584480	The COVID pandemic also helped Musk.
584480	585680	When the Federal Reserve
585680	588240	executed recession-stalling fixes on Wall Street,
588240	590120	bankers invested in Tesla.
590120	593040	Despite Musk's derision of COVID stimulus checks,
593040	595760	Tesla received stimulus money from the government.
595760	597280	At the beginning of the pandemic,
597280	600120	Tesla stock hovered around $120 a share.
600120	603160	In late 2021, a year and a half into COVID,
603160	605240	it was worth 10 times that,
605240	607320	all of which greatly increased the net worth
607320	609600	of the top shareholder, Elon.
609640	611480	But to maintain the world-saving myth,
611480	613920	he has to look like he doesn't make any money.
613920	616400	My cash balances are very, very low.
616400	618880	I simply had loans against my stock,
618880	622000	so if Tesla's SpaceX went bankrupt,
622000	623400	I would go bankrupt too.
623400	625880	Most U.S. companies don't allow their executives
625880	627840	to take out loans against their stock,
627840	631200	but Tesla does, and Musk has taken advantage,
631200	634280	borrowing millions of dollars for his personal coffers,
634280	636480	using his Tesla stock as collateral.
636480	638120	Loans don't count as income
638120	640200	in the eyes of the IRS or the public.
640200	642080	But even without the loans,
642080	647080	in 2021, Musk made 18,043 times the average Tesla employee.
647680	651440	Tesla justifies that wild ratio to investors in SEC filings
651440	653560	by arguing Elon's worth it.
653560	655720	Elon Musk has contributed significantly
655720	658040	and actively to us since our earliest days,
658040	660320	raising capital, bringing investors,
660320	662280	and raising public awareness.
662280	664960	Yeah, Tesla's own SEC filings admit
664960	667080	that the myth of Elon is inherently tied
667080	668520	to the value of the company.
668520	672280	If people stop believing in Elon, Tesla loses value,
672280	673600	and Elon knows that.
673600	675920	He even admits much of Tesla's value
675920	677560	is based on a promise.
677560	680880	The overwhelming focus is solving full self-driving.
680880	683040	That's really the difference between Tesla
683040	685640	being worth a lot of money and being worth basically zero.
685640	688720	But full self-driving has yet to be safely implemented,
688720	691680	and the latest data suggests it's incredibly unsafe.
691680	694280	Tesla's system is nowhere near ready.
694280	696880	Regardless, Musk is still wildly wealthy
696880	698320	from the promises he's made,
698320	701120	and that's also made him very powerful.
701120	702800	Elon says his goal is...
702800	707800	We want to maximize happiness to the population
707800	710320	and propagate into the future as far as possible.
710320	712800	But he's really using that wealth and power
712800	714280	as all billionaires do.
714280	716800	Not to save humanity, but to crush it.
716800	718720	He squashes worker power.
718720	721480	They fired me because I tried to improve the lives
721480	723040	of my coworkers and myself.
723040	724200	That's why they fired me,
724200	725760	because it wasn't a part of Elon's plan.
725760	728480	And now that he has both power and a soapbox,
728480	730920	his dangerous anti-government political beliefs
730920	732480	are even more important.
732480	734920	Previously, Elon was a liberal darling.
734920	736920	Obama's 2015 State of the Union
