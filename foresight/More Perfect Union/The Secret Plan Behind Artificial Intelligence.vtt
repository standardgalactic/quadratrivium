00:00.000 --> 00:04.240
I'm about to say something that you would never expect to hear from more perfect union.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.600
Elon Musk is right about something.

00:07.600 --> 00:10.080
Elon Musk is suing the maker of chat, GPT,

00:10.080 --> 00:14.160
suing open AI, suing open AI for breach of contract

00:14.160 --> 00:16.800
by putting profit ahead of benefiting humanity.

00:16.800 --> 00:22.560
Elon's lawsuit against open AI, the most recognizable developer of artificial intelligence,

00:22.560 --> 00:26.800
was big news. But when I heard it, I was a bit confused.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.520
When has Elon ever been against profit?

00:29.520 --> 00:37.040
So I dug it. I read and I watched far too much of these guys talking about AI.

00:37.040 --> 00:41.920
I think that AI will be a technological revolution on the scale of the agricultural,

00:41.920 --> 00:43.520
the industrial, the computer revolution.

00:43.520 --> 00:50.000
AI is about to revolutionize digital biology and genomics and transportation and retail.

00:50.000 --> 00:54.320
Artificial intelligence, this is, it is a renaissance.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.400
This is a world-changing set of advances.

00:58.480 --> 01:03.040
By the time these lawsuits are decided, we'll have digital god, so digital god.

01:03.040 --> 01:07.600
I noticed three things. That the rise of AI is inevitable.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.400
That it will change everything about our lives.

01:11.120 --> 01:17.520
And that there's a war brewing between a handful of billionaires to seize control of it.

01:18.320 --> 01:24.800
Nvidia became one of the most valuable stocks of all time producing chips for AI.

01:24.800 --> 01:30.560
Microsoft reached an over $3 trillion valuation based on its AI work.

01:30.560 --> 01:34.240
And open AI tripled in value in just 10 months.

01:34.880 --> 01:42.960
But where do we, you, and I, and everyone other than the dozen or so billionaires duking it out

01:42.960 --> 01:48.960
for control fit in? We're already seeing plans to replace human nurses with AI.

01:48.960 --> 01:53.360
Media magnates killing jobs to focus on cost cutting with AI.

01:53.360 --> 01:59.040
AI written drivel filling the internet. And AI that does karaoke for you.

01:59.760 --> 02:06.800
But let's look at the possible AI future through the rise of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.

02:06.800 --> 02:11.120
And just one contender in the billionaire battle for the future.

02:12.080 --> 02:21.760
Sam Altman is the ruler of Silicon Valley startups. And that's not me saying that. He thinks that.

02:21.760 --> 02:26.080
I think the president of YC is sort of the unofficial leader of the startup movement.

02:26.080 --> 02:31.200
YC is Y Combinator, a significant venture capital firm and tech incubator that Altman

02:31.200 --> 02:36.880
ran from 2014 to 2019. He'd originally connected with YC in 2008.

02:36.880 --> 02:44.400
When the firm funded his app, Looped, when he was 19 years old and wore two popped collars.

02:44.400 --> 02:50.400
Looped was a common Silicon Valley story. They raised a ton of money, gathered a bunch of data,

02:50.400 --> 02:55.040
and got in trouble for texting everyone on your phone when you downloaded the app.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.800
Altman sold the company and it all but disappeared.

02:59.360 --> 03:04.400
Altman landed at Y Combinator where he rose to president in two years.

03:04.400 --> 03:09.200
Under Altman's leadership, Y Combinator invested in massive companies most people have heard of,

03:09.200 --> 03:16.240
like Reddit, Airbnb, Coinbase, Dropbox, Stripe, Twitch, DoorDash, and Instacart.

03:16.880 --> 03:21.040
In a lecture to Stanford computer science students on startups,

03:21.040 --> 03:23.280
Altman quoted Peter Thiel's advice.

03:23.920 --> 03:28.720
As Peter Thiel is going to discuss in the fifth class, you want an idea that turns into a monopoly.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.960
But you can't get a monopoly in a big market right away. You have to find a small market

03:32.960 --> 03:35.360
in which you can get a monopoly and then quickly expand.

03:35.360 --> 03:40.320
Quick expansion is an inherent part of the way venture capital funded tech runs today.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.160
This is Tim O'Reilly. He's been in tech forever.

03:44.160 --> 03:50.960
And if you know phrases like open source or WEM 2.0, it's because he popularized them.

03:50.960 --> 03:57.600
One of the big problems with today's Silicon Valley is that it no longer really supports

03:57.680 --> 04:03.440
remarket competition. Early days of VCD, you were really talking about funding

04:03.440 --> 04:06.640
insurgent companies that had an experimental idea.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.960
Most companies didn't actually raise massive amounts of capital.

04:10.960 --> 04:13.520
But at some point that changed.

04:13.520 --> 04:20.480
But then you fast forward to 2010 in the wake of the look super low interest rates is all this

04:20.480 --> 04:26.720
cheap capital and companies are just buying market share. And I call this the Uber problem.

04:26.880 --> 04:31.280
We didn't see real competition with different business models, different pricing.

04:31.280 --> 04:36.640
We saw two heavily capitalized companies driving everybody else out of business.

04:37.200 --> 04:42.640
By growing rapidly with a bunch of capital, Uber created an ecosystem where if you want

04:42.640 --> 04:49.520
a cab, you need to use Uber. The old system of car services was pretty much pushed out of existence.

04:49.520 --> 04:55.360
Uber is not an Altman company, but DoorDash, Airbnb and other companies that used similar

04:55.360 --> 05:00.400
strategies totally are. In 2015, we get our first hint of open AI.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.520
I actually just agreed to fund a company that is not even really a company,

05:03.520 --> 05:08.320
sort of a semi company, semi nonprofit doing AI safety research.

05:08.320 --> 05:13.760
Open AI is announced as not a company, but a nonprofit focused on AI safety,

05:14.320 --> 05:20.240
funded and supported by Y Combinator, Elon Musk, Reed Hoffman, the LinkedIn guy,

05:20.800 --> 05:27.200
Peter Thiel, Amazon and Infosys. Basically a who's who of the people who built

05:27.200 --> 05:33.840
the broken tech infrastructure of today. The stated goal of open AI was to advance digital

05:33.840 --> 05:39.760
intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, with no shareholders

05:39.760 --> 05:45.200
to be beholden to. We wanted to build this with humanity's best interest at heart.

05:45.200 --> 05:50.880
That doesn't sound too bad, right? A groundbreaking new technology,

05:50.880 --> 05:54.880
its power available to all without any responsibility to shareholders?

05:55.600 --> 06:00.720
But let's dig a little deeper. They say they want to make the world

06:00.720 --> 06:06.320
better and do it safely, but what does that mean to them? Most of what Altman talks about

06:06.320 --> 06:12.720
in regards to what open AI's products can do seems to center on productivity, efficiency

06:12.720 --> 06:16.480
and margin boosting. Our ability to have amazing ideas

06:17.120 --> 06:21.440
for our children to like teach themselves more than ever before for people to be more productive.

06:21.440 --> 06:26.800
How does that make life better for the rest of us? Well, Altman claims to have the answer.

06:26.800 --> 06:33.280
In his essay, Moore's Law for Everything, he explains it would require simply changing the

06:33.280 --> 06:39.840
entire economic system. Altman claims AI would drive down labor costs so everything would get

06:39.840 --> 06:45.360
cheaper. And the lost jobs would be offset by a universal basic income coming from corporate

06:45.360 --> 06:53.920
and property tax rates, with no other taxes. Which sounds great, maybe, but how true is that?

06:53.920 --> 07:00.800
Would corporations see falling labor costs and reduced prices or just keep the profits for themselves?

07:00.800 --> 07:07.280
Would a flat tax and UBI mean more money for working people or more tax cheating by the rich

07:07.280 --> 07:12.640
and social service cuts for everyone else? And there's a running theme through all of what Altman

07:12.640 --> 07:18.800
says, the inevitability and the danger of artificial intelligence. Listen to this clip.

07:18.800 --> 07:23.680
You know, I think AI will probably like most likely sort of lead to the end of the world.

07:23.680 --> 07:28.800
People like Altman benefit from the narrative that AI is this big scary thing,

07:28.800 --> 07:34.560
even as they're the ones trying to build and profit from it. Here's Tim O'Reilly again.

07:34.560 --> 07:41.680
It feels a little bit like a kind of misdirection. They're basically calling for a kind of regulation

07:41.680 --> 07:49.280
of an extreme risk to avoid the regulation of the many proximate harms we can see today.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.720
If they were really afraid of it, they would stop doing their research. Instead,

07:52.720 --> 07:58.080
they're racing to accelerate it so they can get a monopoly. It's a lot like the famous

07:58.080 --> 08:01.600
lion from the Wizard of Oz. It paid no attention to the man behind the curtain.

08:02.240 --> 08:08.400
And a lot of what I spent my time in talking about AI regulation is this. There is a man behind

08:08.400 --> 08:14.880
the curtain or a series of men who are making decisions for their business advantage. And

08:14.880 --> 08:20.240
those are the things that we need to be regulating. Why are they moving fast to break things?

08:20.240 --> 08:24.800
I mean, in the Altman clip from before where he says the world ending thing,

08:24.800 --> 08:30.160
he literally says this right after. You know, I think AI will probably like most likely sort of

08:30.720 --> 08:35.360
lead to the end of the world. But in the meantime, there will be great companies created with

08:35.360 --> 08:42.800
serious machine learning companies. See, it's right back to profit. But hold on, isn't open AI

08:42.800 --> 08:44.960
a nonprofit? Not anymore.

08:48.480 --> 08:52.560
Just three years after the founding of open AI, they transitioned to something they're calling

08:53.280 --> 08:59.040
mixed profit. To do what we needed to go do, we had tried and failed enough to raise the money as

08:59.040 --> 09:04.800
a nonprofit. We didn't see a path forward there. So we needed some of the benefits of capitalism,

09:04.800 --> 09:11.280
but not too much. And the new board of open AI is rife with the profiteers who've been extracting

09:11.280 --> 09:18.160
value from working people for decades. They're also not open. None of this stuff is just simply

09:18.160 --> 09:25.760
available. Sure, an old version of chat DBT is free and kind of fun sometimes. But open AI's real

09:25.760 --> 09:31.920
product is enterprise software doing partnerships with other giant tech companies and loads of

09:31.920 --> 09:38.320
stuff we don't even know about. Defense contracts included. Open AI has a product to sell a product

09:38.320 --> 09:44.480
they see as having inevitable near universal proliferation, which is a pretty damn good business

09:44.480 --> 09:50.320
plan. But it's dangerous for the rest of us. You know what Tim O'Reilly said about the Uber

09:50.320 --> 09:56.400
problem. Here's how it applies to AI. All of the smaller AI firms are already starting to fold

09:57.200 --> 10:03.680
because there are a couple in the form of open AI and Anthropic that are incredibly heavily funded

10:03.680 --> 10:08.960
that have tens of billions of dollars of capital. And we don't know that they're the best companies.

10:08.960 --> 10:14.000
We just know that they're the ones that big investors picked up early. And so we have a

10:14.000 --> 10:22.560
defective kind of market where if you really believe in the wisdom of millions of people

10:22.560 --> 10:29.120
making independent decisions based on optimal information to kind of do work this re-magic

10:29.120 --> 10:34.000
market, we don't have that. We have a central committee of deep-pocketed investors. It all

10:34.000 --> 10:40.160
illuminates Elon's lawsuit against open AI when he and Altman had once been such good friends.

10:40.160 --> 10:42.480
I'm looking for a new video gameplay. Can you give me a recommendation?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.720
Overwatch. After Overwatch. Yes, go else.

10:47.440 --> 10:54.480
I named it open AI after open source. It is in fact closed source. It should be renamed

10:54.480 --> 11:02.080
super closed source for maximum profit AI. But he has his own for sale for profit AI that he

11:02.080 --> 11:07.920
wants to be predominant. He made it open source in a seemingly empty gesture. But

11:07.920 --> 11:12.320
meanwhile, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google all want to take control of the tech

11:12.320 --> 11:18.000
that will change our future and destroy our jobs. It doesn't matter that these guys say

11:18.000 --> 11:24.160
they're doing it for good. It matters what they are actually doing. Look at the DOM of the Internet

11:24.160 --> 11:32.320
itself. Or web 2.0. That's social media and user generated content. All of that seemed great.

11:32.320 --> 11:37.360
And yeah, the modern Internet has obviously had a lot of clear benefits. But it was also

11:37.360 --> 11:43.600
pretty quickly ruined by giant corporations and profit motive. We're already starting to see

11:43.600 --> 11:49.840
effects of the AI power grab. Nvidia, the main producer of the chips used for AI, is partnering

11:49.840 --> 11:56.800
with a company that wants to replace nurses with an AI that costs $9 an hour. Look at anything from

11:56.800 --> 12:02.480
the history of the American medicine industry. Will a new low cost tool actually help patients

12:02.480 --> 12:08.880
or just pad investor pockets? Companies are using AI to do job interviews and it's shutting out

12:08.880 --> 12:14.960
applicants unfairly. And on a simply annoying level, they're spitting out content that's making

12:14.960 --> 12:22.320
the Internet even more unusable than it already was. AI generated LinkedIn comments? Why don't you

12:22.320 --> 12:28.080
just not post anything if you don't have anything to say? So what are we going to do about this?

12:28.880 --> 12:36.480
Well, let's turn to Sam Altman for advice. He has what he calls the more good guys than bad guys

12:36.480 --> 12:42.640
approach. He wrote in that Moore's Law essay, There are bad humans, but all humans are within a

12:42.640 --> 12:49.600
magnitude are as powerful as one another. And the good humans, and together to stop the bad humans.

12:50.240 --> 12:56.000
It's been that way through all of history so far. What if the bad humans are actually the people

12:56.000 --> 13:02.560
building the system? One built entirely on fast profits and monopoly, advancing as quickly as

13:02.560 --> 13:09.360
possible. Then we need more good guys and we've got them. They're like 12 people. What if we all

13:09.360 --> 13:16.480
stand up and say no? When electricity was first becoming widespread, it was still dangerous for

13:16.480 --> 13:23.120
the low paid workers who were setting up the systems. But those workers stood together and formed

13:23.120 --> 13:27.360
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, that's the Electricians Union,

13:27.360 --> 13:34.480
to demand safer jobs and better wages. It worked and it didn't hamper progress. We clearly have

13:34.480 --> 13:41.280
electricity today, right? That same concept applies to AI too. Remember the writer's strike?

13:41.840 --> 13:48.160
The screenwriter's guild stood up and said no to AI taking their jobs. Senator Bernie Sanders

13:48.160 --> 13:53.600
just introduced legislation for a shorter work week. Do we continue the trend that technology

13:53.600 --> 14:00.640
only benefits the people on top? Or do we demand that these transformational changes benefit working

14:00.640 --> 14:07.760
people? And one of the benefits must be a lower work week. If AI is going to make workers more

14:07.760 --> 14:14.080
productive and labor cheaper, workers should be able to take advantage of it. AI cannot exist

14:14.080 --> 14:20.240
without being trained on all that humanity has done before. That's literally how chat GPT,

14:20.240 --> 14:26.880
the way most people interact with AI, was built by reading a bunch of stuff online and then

14:26.880 --> 14:34.560
synthesizing it so it can talk. If all of this is built on the labor of all of humanity, then

14:34.560 --> 14:40.960
it should be all of humanity that benefits. Thank you so much for watching. If you want to
