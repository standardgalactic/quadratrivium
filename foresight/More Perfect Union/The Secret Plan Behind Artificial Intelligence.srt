1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm about to say something that you would never expect to hear from more perfect union.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,600
Elon Musk is right about something.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,080
Elon Musk is suing the maker of chat, GPT,

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
suing open AI, suing open AI for breach of contract

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,800
by putting profit ahead of benefiting humanity.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,560
Elon's lawsuit against open AI, the most recognizable developer of artificial intelligence,

7
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,800
was big news. But when I heard it, I was a bit confused.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,520
When has Elon ever been against profit?

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:37,040
So I dug it. I read and I watched far too much of these guys talking about AI.

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,920
I think that AI will be a technological revolution on the scale of the agricultural,

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,520
the industrial, the computer revolution.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,000
AI is about to revolutionize digital biology and genomics and transportation and retail.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,320
Artificial intelligence, this is, it is a renaissance.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,400
This is a world-changing set of advances.

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,040
By the time these lawsuits are decided, we'll have digital god, so digital god.

16
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,600
I noticed three things. That the rise of AI is inevitable.

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,400
That it will change everything about our lives.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,520
And that there's a war brewing between a handful of billionaires to seize control of it.

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,800
Nvidia became one of the most valuable stocks of all time producing chips for AI.

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,560
Microsoft reached an over $3 trillion valuation based on its AI work.

21
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
And open AI tripled in value in just 10 months.

22
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,960
But where do we, you, and I, and everyone other than the dozen or so billionaires duking it out

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,960
for control fit in? We're already seeing plans to replace human nurses with AI.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,360
Media magnates killing jobs to focus on cost cutting with AI.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,040
AI written drivel filling the internet. And AI that does karaoke for you.

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,800
But let's look at the possible AI future through the rise of Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI.

27
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,120
And just one contender in the billionaire battle for the future.

28
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:21,760
Sam Altman is the ruler of Silicon Valley startups. And that's not me saying that. He thinks that.

29
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,080
I think the president of YC is sort of the unofficial leader of the startup movement.

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,200
YC is Y Combinator, a significant venture capital firm and tech incubator that Altman

31
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,880
ran from 2014 to 2019. He'd originally connected with YC in 2008.

32
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:44,400
When the firm funded his app, Looped, when he was 19 years old and wore two popped collars.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Looped was a common Silicon Valley story. They raised a ton of money, gathered a bunch of data,

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
and got in trouble for texting everyone on your phone when you downloaded the app.

35
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,800
Altman sold the company and it all but disappeared.

36
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,400
Altman landed at Y Combinator where he rose to president in two years.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Under Altman's leadership, Y Combinator invested in massive companies most people have heard of,

38
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:16,240
like Reddit, Airbnb, Coinbase, Dropbox, Stripe, Twitch, DoorDash, and Instacart.

39
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,040
In a lecture to Stanford computer science students on startups,

40
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
Altman quoted Peter Thiel's advice.

41
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,720
As Peter Thiel is going to discuss in the fifth class, you want an idea that turns into a monopoly.

42
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,960
But you can't get a monopoly in a big market right away. You have to find a small market

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,360
in which you can get a monopoly and then quickly expand.

44
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,320
Quick expansion is an inherent part of the way venture capital funded tech runs today.

45
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,160
This is Tim O'Reilly. He's been in tech forever.

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,960
And if you know phrases like open source or WEM 2.0, it's because he popularized them.

47
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:57,600
One of the big problems with today's Silicon Valley is that it no longer really supports

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,440
remarket competition. Early days of VCD, you were really talking about funding

49
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,640
insurgent companies that had an experimental idea.

50
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,960
Most companies didn't actually raise massive amounts of capital.

51
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,520
But at some point that changed.

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,480
But then you fast forward to 2010 in the wake of the look super low interest rates is all this

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:26,720
cheap capital and companies are just buying market share. And I call this the Uber problem.

54
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,280
We didn't see real competition with different business models, different pricing.

55
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,640
We saw two heavily capitalized companies driving everybody else out of business.

56
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,640
By growing rapidly with a bunch of capital, Uber created an ecosystem where if you want

57
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:49,520
a cab, you need to use Uber. The old system of car services was pretty much pushed out of existence.

58
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,360
Uber is not an Altman company, but DoorDash, Airbnb and other companies that used similar

59
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,400
strategies totally are. In 2015, we get our first hint of open AI.

60
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
I actually just agreed to fund a company that is not even really a company,

61
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,320
sort of a semi company, semi nonprofit doing AI safety research.

62
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:13,760
Open AI is announced as not a company, but a nonprofit focused on AI safety,

63
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,240
funded and supported by Y Combinator, Elon Musk, Reed Hoffman, the LinkedIn guy,

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,200
Peter Thiel, Amazon and Infosys. Basically a who's who of the people who built

65
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:33,840
the broken tech infrastructure of today. The stated goal of open AI was to advance digital

66
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:39,760
intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, with no shareholders

67
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:45,200
to be beholden to. We wanted to build this with humanity's best interest at heart.

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:50,880
That doesn't sound too bad, right? A groundbreaking new technology,

69
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,880
its power available to all without any responsibility to shareholders?

70
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,720
But let's dig a little deeper. They say they want to make the world

71
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,320
better and do it safely, but what does that mean to them? Most of what Altman talks about

72
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:12,720
in regards to what open AI's products can do seems to center on productivity, efficiency

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,480
and margin boosting. Our ability to have amazing ideas

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,440
for our children to like teach themselves more than ever before for people to be more productive.

75
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,800
How does that make life better for the rest of us? Well, Altman claims to have the answer.

76
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,280
In his essay, Moore's Law for Everything, he explains it would require simply changing the

77
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,840
entire economic system. Altman claims AI would drive down labor costs so everything would get

78
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,360
cheaper. And the lost jobs would be offset by a universal basic income coming from corporate

79
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,920
and property tax rates, with no other taxes. Which sounds great, maybe, but how true is that?

80
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:00,800
Would corporations see falling labor costs and reduced prices or just keep the profits for themselves?

81
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,280
Would a flat tax and UBI mean more money for working people or more tax cheating by the rich

82
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,640
and social service cuts for everyone else? And there's a running theme through all of what Altman

83
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,800
says, the inevitability and the danger of artificial intelligence. Listen to this clip.

84
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,680
You know, I think AI will probably like most likely sort of lead to the end of the world.

85
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,800
People like Altman benefit from the narrative that AI is this big scary thing,

86
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,560
even as they're the ones trying to build and profit from it. Here's Tim O'Reilly again.

87
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,680
It feels a little bit like a kind of misdirection. They're basically calling for a kind of regulation

88
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:49,280
of an extreme risk to avoid the regulation of the many proximate harms we can see today.

89
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,720
If they were really afraid of it, they would stop doing their research. Instead,

90
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,080
they're racing to accelerate it so they can get a monopoly. It's a lot like the famous

91
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,600
lion from the Wizard of Oz. It paid no attention to the man behind the curtain.

92
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,400
And a lot of what I spent my time in talking about AI regulation is this. There is a man behind

93
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:14,880
the curtain or a series of men who are making decisions for their business advantage. And

94
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,240
those are the things that we need to be regulating. Why are they moving fast to break things?

95
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
I mean, in the Altman clip from before where he says the world ending thing,

96
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,160
he literally says this right after. You know, I think AI will probably like most likely sort of

97
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,360
lead to the end of the world. But in the meantime, there will be great companies created with

98
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,800
serious machine learning companies. See, it's right back to profit. But hold on, isn't open AI

99
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,960
a nonprofit? Not anymore.

100
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
Just three years after the founding of open AI, they transitioned to something they're calling

101
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,040
mixed profit. To do what we needed to go do, we had tried and failed enough to raise the money as

102
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,800
a nonprofit. We didn't see a path forward there. So we needed some of the benefits of capitalism,

103
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,280
but not too much. And the new board of open AI is rife with the profiteers who've been extracting

104
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,160
value from working people for decades. They're also not open. None of this stuff is just simply

105
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:25,760
available. Sure, an old version of chat DBT is free and kind of fun sometimes. But open AI's real

106
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:31,920
product is enterprise software doing partnerships with other giant tech companies and loads of

107
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,320
stuff we don't even know about. Defense contracts included. Open AI has a product to sell a product

108
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,480
they see as having inevitable near universal proliferation, which is a pretty damn good business

109
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,320
plan. But it's dangerous for the rest of us. You know what Tim O'Reilly said about the Uber

110
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,400
problem. Here's how it applies to AI. All of the smaller AI firms are already starting to fold

111
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,680
because there are a couple in the form of open AI and Anthropic that are incredibly heavily funded

112
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,960
that have tens of billions of dollars of capital. And we don't know that they're the best companies.

113
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:14,000
We just know that they're the ones that big investors picked up early. And so we have a

114
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:22,560
defective kind of market where if you really believe in the wisdom of millions of people

115
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,120
making independent decisions based on optimal information to kind of do work this re-magic

116
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,000
market, we don't have that. We have a central committee of deep-pocketed investors. It all

117
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:40,160
illuminates Elon's lawsuit against open AI when he and Altman had once been such good friends.

118
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm looking for a new video gameplay. Can you give me a recommendation?

119
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,720
Overwatch. After Overwatch. Yes, go else.

120
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,480
I named it open AI after open source. It is in fact closed source. It should be renamed

121
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:02,080
super closed source for maximum profit AI. But he has his own for sale for profit AI that he

122
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,920
wants to be predominant. He made it open source in a seemingly empty gesture. But

123
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,320
meanwhile, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google all want to take control of the tech

124
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,000
that will change our future and destroy our jobs. It doesn't matter that these guys say

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,160
they're doing it for good. It matters what they are actually doing. Look at the DOM of the Internet

126
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,320
itself. Or web 2.0. That's social media and user generated content. All of that seemed great.

127
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,360
And yeah, the modern Internet has obviously had a lot of clear benefits. But it was also

128
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,600
pretty quickly ruined by giant corporations and profit motive. We're already starting to see

129
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,840
effects of the AI power grab. Nvidia, the main producer of the chips used for AI, is partnering

130
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,800
with a company that wants to replace nurses with an AI that costs $9 an hour. Look at anything from

131
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:02,480
the history of the American medicine industry. Will a new low cost tool actually help patients

132
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,880
or just pad investor pockets? Companies are using AI to do job interviews and it's shutting out

133
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,960
applicants unfairly. And on a simply annoying level, they're spitting out content that's making

134
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:22,320
the Internet even more unusable than it already was. AI generated LinkedIn comments? Why don't you

135
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,080
just not post anything if you don't have anything to say? So what are we going to do about this?

136
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:36,480
Well, let's turn to Sam Altman for advice. He has what he calls the more good guys than bad guys

137
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,640
approach. He wrote in that Moore's Law essay, There are bad humans, but all humans are within a

138
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:49,600
magnitude are as powerful as one another. And the good humans, and together to stop the bad humans.

139
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,000
It's been that way through all of history so far. What if the bad humans are actually the people

140
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,560
building the system? One built entirely on fast profits and monopoly, advancing as quickly as

141
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:09,360
possible. Then we need more good guys and we've got them. They're like 12 people. What if we all

142
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,480
stand up and say no? When electricity was first becoming widespread, it was still dangerous for

143
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,120
the low paid workers who were setting up the systems. But those workers stood together and formed

144
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,360
the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, that's the Electricians Union,

145
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,480
to demand safer jobs and better wages. It worked and it didn't hamper progress. We clearly have

146
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,280
electricity today, right? That same concept applies to AI too. Remember the writer's strike?

147
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,160
The screenwriter's guild stood up and said no to AI taking their jobs. Senator Bernie Sanders

148
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:53,600
just introduced legislation for a shorter work week. Do we continue the trend that technology

149
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,640
only benefits the people on top? Or do we demand that these transformational changes benefit working

150
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,760
people? And one of the benefits must be a lower work week. If AI is going to make workers more

151
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,080
productive and labor cheaper, workers should be able to take advantage of it. AI cannot exist
