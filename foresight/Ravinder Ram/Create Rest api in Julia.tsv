0	6240	Hi guys, in this video I am going to show you how you can create a REST API by using Julia.
6240	9440	API means here Application Programming Interface.
10160	17840	Due to this you can talk to any language like you can call you can talk to any language and
18480	26400	even you can talk with the command line by the curl and you can also talk from mobile.
26400	31360	You can think as suppose you go to the Japanese restaurant and you don't know Japanese
32160	38400	and what you need to do now you need a converter who convert English language into Japanese
39040	47680	then you finally got the dish for example you can if you use the azure azure is a cloud platform
48320	55760	which is provided by the Microsoft and there are API available for different different services for
55760	63120	if you want to do text analytics there is also there is API available for that for different
63120	72240	tasks for API is available in the azure similarly for Google cloud and Amazon web service similarly
72240	80400	if you go to the yatra.com or booking.com so this website basically for traveling or
80400	88000	hotel booking or flight booking they under the hood they actually using the API so API is very
88000	95440	famous things in the internet and you use probably you use most of the time API service
96080	102400	in your daily life so what I will do so I am calling the REST API
103360	114400	to the Julia from the R programming so what I do I create a JSON data structure in R then I send
114400	121520	to the JSON request to the Julia server Julia REST API server then Julia responds the JSON
121520	131120	response so suppose I want a sum of the array so four plus five nine plus six fifteen so it will
131120	137520	give you the result the fifteen like that you can call to any language like I will show you in
137520	145840	two languages R and Python to create a REST API in Julia I am using here gini package so this is
145840	152400	the basic command first out what I am doing I activating the gini environment variable then
152400	162240	I change the directory gini apps so if you observed here this is my folder so I am going there
163840	171760	buy run this command cd so change directory then I import the gini package to create the REST API
172320	180240	you have to type new app underscore web service and put here your app name so I am I am taking
180240	190480	here test zero so this is my app name so when you run this it will create a create the template for
190480	200480	you this is my home directory and this is my folder under this folder so this is a my template
201120	208720	so this is my whole app test zero to run your app what you can do so in under the bin directory
209440	217280	so you have to run either server or repl all the logic you have to type here in roots.gl file
218080	228720	so I open this file so I need to use the router it is a compulsory and I am also using gini and
228960	237520	I also using the request module so for that type here gini.request
239280	254400	to rendering the json response I have to use the json so I type here renderer.json
255360	264560	now I am making the root so json payload whatever you can give the name and I want to do the post
264560	278880	request so method I want post to show you the json response you have to use the macros at the
278960	286480	at the red so so I I want to show the json payload this is a function
292320	299280	whatever this function is written this is so to the user I also want to show the
301200	307760	row payload then I want to save the user's data so suppose users give me the array
308480	313360	so I save this in a variable suppose you
318640	324800	json payload is a function which it return a dictionary so that's why I am writing here in
325840	335280	the close bracket I show you how it actually work so I open the repl so first I am making the
336240	344240	first function f which have no argument and it return our data structure integer so one
345120	355040	so whenever I call f then press enter it will return no parenthesis so it will return a one
355200	365280	function similarly suppose if I type here the data structure array one two and three
366720	373600	if I call this function so this is no this has no argument so I have to call in parenthesis
373600	381520	if you press enter it will return a data structure array similarly if I type here a dictionary
386000	393520	so if I call this function it will return a dictionary if I want to extract the first element
394320	398320	so I have to write here in bracket a
402320	408160	so it will return an array like that it return an array of the users
409120	415520	now I want to do some calculation in this array let's suppose I want to show the
415520	424080	sum of the vector to the user now I want to give the json response you just need to use the json
424160	437440	function that's it and your rest api is ready now now I run the app so bin repl
439520	450320	call the up function to run the server so my app is running in this url now I am calling
450400	459840	from r or r and python so this is python and first I am importing the request module so then I am
460720	469360	requesting the post request in this url so this is my server url so if you observed here
469920	479440	julia is running in the so what I do I just copy this url and paste this so this is the local host
479440	489680	and this is the port number and this is my the root and I am giving the json data array 456
489680	499200	so I run this command to get the result response type here response your variable name and json
500320	508080	so as you can see that uh sum of array is 15 so which is 100 correct similarly in r you have to
508080	516480	use the sttr library and json light library I I write here url where my julia server is running
516480	523200	and I put here json data then I run the post request
526080	530000	to see the content you have to use the content function in the r
531440	535040	so as you can see that sum of array is 15 thank you
