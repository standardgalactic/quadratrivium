WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
areas of medicine, including RNA chemistry,

00:02.640 --> 00:04.680
coronavirus therapeutics.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.320
Before his current role, he was a member

00:06.320 --> 00:07.520
of the Department of Pathology

00:07.520 --> 00:09.720
at the Stanford University School of Medicine.

00:09.720 --> 00:11.880
Dr. Quay, welcome to the committee.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.280
You are now recognized for your opening statement.

00:16.600 --> 00:19.080
Committee Chair, Senator Peters,

00:19.080 --> 00:20.880
Ranking Member, Senator Paul.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.040
Committee members, invited participants,

00:23.040 --> 00:24.600
ladies and gentlemen.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.280
I am a physician scientist and have a 50 year career

00:27.280 --> 00:29.800
spanning academic medical research,

00:29.800 --> 00:33.520
biotechnology, and scientific fraud investigation.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.080
My biography summarizes my career.

00:36.080 --> 00:39.360
I speak today, however, as an independent scientist.

00:39.360 --> 00:43.960
I do not receive any NIH or NIAID funding.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.080
Scientists dependent on NIH or NIAID funding

00:47.080 --> 00:50.920
may have pressure to publicly agree with orthodoxies

00:50.920 --> 00:53.880
that privately they admit are wrong.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.080
My approach to the COVID pandemic origin

00:56.080 --> 00:59.480
that killed 20 million plus people

00:59.480 --> 01:02.440
caused $20 trillion in economic damage

01:02.440 --> 01:05.800
is based on six approaches to the data and the events.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.840
I'll start with something Dr. Gary said privately.

01:08.840 --> 01:11.600
Quote, someone should tell nature,

01:11.600 --> 01:13.120
meaning the British Journal,

01:13.120 --> 01:15.160
that the fish market probably did not start

01:15.160 --> 01:17.160
to outbreak, end quote.

01:17.160 --> 01:19.160
I agree with Dr. Gary.

01:19.160 --> 01:21.600
Unfortunately, one reason we are having these hearings

01:21.600 --> 01:24.440
is that the public statements of many virologists

01:24.440 --> 01:28.400
have not been congruent with their private conversations.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.640
In any case, I'll describe the six approaches

01:30.640 --> 01:34.120
to the question that all support a lab leak as a source

01:34.120 --> 01:37.680
and can go deeper into each of those with questions.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.320
First, the virus was spreading in Wuhan

01:40.320 --> 01:43.240
and around the world in the fall of 2019,

01:43.240 --> 01:46.560
months before the first case in the Hunan seafood market.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.200
This is supported by 14 observations or evidence.

01:50.200 --> 01:52.320
The evidence includes the calculation of the time

01:52.320 --> 01:54.280
to the most recent common ancestor,

01:54.280 --> 01:56.240
hospital overloads in Wuhan,

01:56.240 --> 01:59.560
antibodies in patients from Italy, Spain and the US,

01:59.560 --> 02:01.720
wastewater samples from Brazil,

02:01.720 --> 02:04.840
sick athletes at the October Wuhan Military Games,

02:04.840 --> 02:07.240
school closings in Wuhan,

02:07.240 --> 02:09.480
and dozens of documented patients.

02:09.480 --> 02:13.280
This dismisses out of hand the market as the origin.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.520
But second, let's look at the market data.

02:15.520 --> 02:17.720
The human infections, the animal samples,

02:17.720 --> 02:19.520
and the environmental specimens,

02:19.520 --> 02:22.680
these generate eight observations.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.360
No infected animals in the market

02:24.360 --> 02:26.800
or the supply chain were infected.

02:26.800 --> 02:31.080
No infected wildlife vendors had SARS.

02:31.080 --> 02:35.000
All human infections are the non-ancestral lineage B.

02:35.000 --> 02:39.280
The environmental specimens with animal DNA have no SARS-2.

02:39.280 --> 02:41.320
One vendor had animals from Southern China

02:41.320 --> 02:42.680
where SARS-2 came from,

02:42.680 --> 02:46.480
but this vendor and his animals are negative for SARS-2.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.120
Now, only one of 14 environmental samples

02:49.120 --> 02:52.440
with raccoon dog DNA contains SARS reads,

02:52.440 --> 02:57.440
and that contains one read out of 210 million.

02:57.560 --> 03:02.160
13 of the 14 raccoon dog DNA specimens had no SARS-2.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.560
With SARS-1, literally 100% of the market animals

03:04.560 --> 03:05.680
were infected.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.120
I frankly think it is shameful for scientists

03:08.120 --> 03:10.160
to mislead journalists in the public

03:10.160 --> 03:13.280
saying these data I just described are evidence

03:13.280 --> 03:16.320
raccoon dogs were infected with SARS-2.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.480
This is why trust in science is broken.

03:18.480 --> 03:20.040
None of these data are consistent

03:20.040 --> 03:22.200
with an infected animal passing SARS-2

03:22.360 --> 03:24.120
to a human at the market.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.680
The 1,500 kilometer distance to the nearest SARS-2

03:26.680 --> 03:29.640
related virus is like the distance from Washington, D.C.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.200
to the Florida Everglades.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.480
Imagine you're at dinner at a restaurant in North Bethesda

03:33.480 --> 03:35.240
near the NIAID labs.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.120
You get sick and you are told that the virus you caught

03:38.120 --> 03:40.600
is only found in bats from the Everglades,

03:40.600 --> 03:42.200
but it also happens to be understudied

03:42.200 --> 03:45.440
at the laboratories you see outside the restaurant window.

03:45.440 --> 03:47.000
That's what the market origin people

03:47.000 --> 03:48.800
are asking you to believe.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.160
Third, documented events add or related

03:51.200 --> 03:54.600
to Wuhan Institute of Virology beginning in March 2019

03:54.600 --> 03:57.160
are consistent with the expected activities

03:57.160 --> 04:00.200
when a lab acquired infection has occurred.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.920
This timeline includes unusual attention

04:01.920 --> 04:03.800
from the Chinese Communist Party,

04:03.800 --> 04:07.320
leading to the PLA physician soldier being put in charge.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.800
Large tender requests to repair biosafety equipment,

04:10.800 --> 04:13.640
a virus database disappearing in the middle of the night.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.280
Large tender requests for a lab security force

04:16.280 --> 04:19.680
to quote, handle foreign personnel, end quote.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.960
Patents for a device to prevent a lab acquired infection.

04:22.960 --> 04:24.560
Rumors in the virology community

04:24.560 --> 04:26.480
of a new SARS virus in the lab.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.680
30 vials of the three most dangerous viruses on the planet

04:29.680 --> 04:33.200
being shipped illegally from a lab in Canada to WIV in March,

04:33.200 --> 04:35.360
and then one of those pathogens being found

04:35.360 --> 04:38.400
as a major contaminant in a BLC lab in December.

04:38.400 --> 04:40.800
These events taken together are a classic example

04:40.800 --> 04:43.480
of closing the barn door after the horse is left.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.560
Fourth, the evidence that is found

04:45.560 --> 04:48.200
in a natural zoonosis with respect to the animal host,

04:48.200 --> 04:51.200
the virus, and the human are missing with COVID.

04:51.200 --> 04:55.640
96,000 animals were tested and are negative for SARS-2.

04:55.640 --> 04:59.400
43,000 blood samples from blood donors in Wuhan were tested.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.520
A natural spillover like SARS-1

05:01.520 --> 05:04.520
would have produced about 260 positives.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.320
A lab accident would be zero, and of course,

05:07.320 --> 05:08.840
zero is what is found.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.040
With respect to the virus,

05:10.040 --> 05:13.600
a spillover produces posterior diversity in the virus genome.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.040
A lab leak does not.

05:15.040 --> 05:18.040
SARS-2 has no posterior diversity.

05:18.040 --> 05:20.360
Natural spillovers, as Dr. Gary indicated this morning,

05:20.360 --> 05:21.840
involve multiple markets.

05:21.840 --> 05:24.000
SARS-1 began in southern China,

05:24.000 --> 05:26.680
had 11 spillovers in 11 different markets

05:26.680 --> 05:28.960
in nine different cities.

05:28.960 --> 05:32.800
Christian Anderson, the proximal origin of SARS-2,

05:32.800 --> 05:36.360
said SARS-2 was one person being infected with one animal.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.800
I agree.

05:37.800 --> 05:41.080
Fifth, the genome of SARS-2 has eight features found

05:41.080 --> 05:44.720
in a synthetic virus that are not found in natural viruses.

05:44.720 --> 05:46.920
The probability that SARS-2 came from nature

05:46.920 --> 05:49.920
based on these features is one in a billion.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.640
These features are the backbone,

05:51.640 --> 05:54.560
the receptor binding domain, the furan cleavage site,

05:54.560 --> 05:56.800
the genetics of the furan cleavage site,

05:56.800 --> 06:01.160
the number, location, and pattern of cloning sites

06:01.160 --> 06:03.880
in SARS-2 that use the Barrick cloning method

06:03.880 --> 06:05.560
and the orphate gene.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.240
Based on SARS-2 cloning sites,

06:07.240 --> 06:10.560
I predicted how SARS-2 could be made in the laboratory.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.200
A year later, Barrick used the predicted steps

06:13.200 --> 06:15.760
to make an infectious clone of SARS-2.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.200
These same features were described in a 2018 DARPA grant

06:19.200 --> 06:21.080
by WIV and US scientists.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.160
With respect to the grant,

06:22.160 --> 06:26.360
SARS-2 had the proposed backbone from the proposed region

06:26.360 --> 06:29.240
in China, the proposed adaption to human killing,

06:29.240 --> 06:31.760
the proposed diversity from SARS-1,

06:31.760 --> 06:33.760
the proposed noceum cleavage site,

06:33.760 --> 06:35.600
number, location, and pattern,

06:35.600 --> 06:38.320
the proposed human cleavage site

06:38.320 --> 06:40.680
at the proposed S1, S2 junction.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.240
Let's close with a thought experiment.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.520
Since 2018, do you think a market spillover

06:45.520 --> 06:48.200
of a coronavirus could have happened in Wuhan?

06:48.200 --> 06:51.160
Dr. Dasek and Xi have studied coronavisors for a decade

06:51.160 --> 06:52.440
and they said no.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.600
How do I know that?

06:53.600 --> 06:56.680
Because they used Wuhan residents as control for a study

06:56.680 --> 06:58.800
looking for antibodies in coronaviruses

06:58.800 --> 07:01.080
in people living in your bad caves in southern China.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.160
The rural residents had a 3% rate,

07:03.160 --> 07:05.080
Wuhan residents had zero.

07:05.080 --> 07:08.040
Let's flip that and ask the reverse question.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.880
Do you think a lab acquired infection

07:09.880 --> 07:11.120
could begin in Wuhan,

07:11.120 --> 07:13.120
a city with the world's leading laboratory

07:13.120 --> 07:14.960
collecting coronavirus from nature,

07:14.960 --> 07:17.120
doing synthetic biology on coronaviruses,

07:17.120 --> 07:20.200
doing petri dish and animal research on coronavirus

07:20.200 --> 07:21.880
with a bat colony for testing,

07:21.880 --> 07:24.960
and that had written a blueprint to make a coronavirus

07:24.960 --> 07:28.480
that had seven unique features found in SARS-CoV-2?

07:28.480 --> 07:30.600
I'll let you answer that question yourself.

07:30.600 --> 07:33.360
I have a number of specific reforms I believe

07:33.360 --> 07:35.280
should be implemented and I would be happy

07:35.280 --> 07:37.680
to discuss them during the questioning.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.320
What happens if we have these hearings and nothing happens?

07:40.320 --> 07:41.920
The one is the virology right now

07:41.920 --> 07:45.320
is testing a Nipah virus in a synthetic clone.

07:45.320 --> 07:49.600
This is a U.S. CDC bioterrorism agent.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.800
It kills three out of four people.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.640
A lab leak with an airborne Nipah virus

07:53.640 --> 07:56.240
would quickly within weeks disrupt food and energy

07:56.240 --> 07:59.600
distribution, fire and police services, medical care.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.760
My analysis of this tipping point event

08:01.760 --> 08:05.440
is that it would set back civilization about 250 years.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.200
The work of this committee is critical.

08:07.200 --> 08:10.320
If we now fail to act with the knowledge we have history,

08:10.320 --> 08:12.960
if it can still be recorded, we'll judge us poorly.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.240
Thank you for your time.

08:21.560 --> 08:23.560
Thank you.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.640
Professor of chemistry and chemical biology

08:25.640 --> 08:27.200
at Rutgers University.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.280
He also serves as the laboratory director

08:29.280 --> 08:30.600
for the Waxman Institute.
