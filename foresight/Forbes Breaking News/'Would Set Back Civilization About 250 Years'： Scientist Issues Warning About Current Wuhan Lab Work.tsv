4680	6320	Before his current role, he was a member
6320	7520	of the Department of Pathology
7520	9720	at the Stanford University School of Medicine.
9720	11880	Dr. Quay, welcome to the committee.
11880	14280	You are now recognized for your opening statement.
16600	19080	Committee Chair, Senator Peters,
19080	20880	Ranking Member, Senator Paul.
20880	23040	Committee members, invited participants,
23040	24600	ladies and gentlemen.
24600	27280	I am a physician scientist and have a 50 year career
27280	29800	spanning academic medical research,
29800	33520	biotechnology, and scientific fraud investigation.
33520	36080	My biography summarizes my career.
36080	39360	I speak today, however, as an independent scientist.
39360	43960	I do not receive any NIH or NIAID funding.
43960	47080	Scientists dependent on NIH or NIAID funding
47080	50920	may have pressure to publicly agree with orthodoxies
50920	53880	that privately they admit are wrong.
53880	56080	My approach to the COVID pandemic origin
56080	59480	that killed 20 million plus people
59480	62440	caused $20 trillion in economic damage
62440	65800	is based on six approaches to the data and the events.
66720	68840	I'll start with something Dr. Gary said privately.
68840	71600	Quote, someone should tell nature,
71600	73120	meaning the British Journal,
73120	75160	that the fish market probably did not start
75160	77160	to outbreak, end quote.
77160	79160	I agree with Dr. Gary.
79160	81600	Unfortunately, one reason we are having these hearings
81600	84440	is that the public statements of many virologists
84440	88400	have not been congruent with their private conversations.
88400	90640	In any case, I'll describe the six approaches
90640	94120	to the question that all support a lab leak as a source
94120	97680	and can go deeper into each of those with questions.
97680	100320	First, the virus was spreading in Wuhan
100320	103240	and around the world in the fall of 2019,
103240	106560	months before the first case in the Hunan seafood market.
106560	110200	This is supported by 14 observations or evidence.
110200	112320	The evidence includes the calculation of the time
112320	114280	to the most recent common ancestor,
114280	116240	hospital overloads in Wuhan,
116240	119560	antibodies in patients from Italy, Spain and the US,
119560	121720	wastewater samples from Brazil,
121720	124840	sick athletes at the October Wuhan Military Games,
124840	127240	school closings in Wuhan,
127240	129480	and dozens of documented patients.
129480	133280	This dismisses out of hand the market as the origin.
133280	135520	But second, let's look at the market data.
135520	137720	The human infections, the animal samples,
137720	139520	and the environmental specimens,
139520	142680	these generate eight observations.
142680	144360	No infected animals in the market
144360	146800	or the supply chain were infected.
146800	151080	No infected wildlife vendors had SARS.
151080	155000	All human infections are the non-ancestral lineage B.
155000	159280	The environmental specimens with animal DNA have no SARS-2.
159280	161320	One vendor had animals from Southern China
161320	162680	where SARS-2 came from,
162680	166480	but this vendor and his animals are negative for SARS-2.
166480	169120	Now, only one of 14 environmental samples
169120	172440	with raccoon dog DNA contains SARS reads,
172440	177440	and that contains one read out of 210 million.
177560	182160	13 of the 14 raccoon dog DNA specimens had no SARS-2.
182160	184560	With SARS-1, literally 100% of the market animals
184560	185680	were infected.
185680	188120	I frankly think it is shameful for scientists
188120	190160	to mislead journalists in the public
190160	193280	saying these data I just described are evidence
193280	196320	raccoon dogs were infected with SARS-2.
196320	198480	This is why trust in science is broken.
198480	200040	None of these data are consistent
200040	202200	with an infected animal passing SARS-2
202360	204120	to a human at the market.
204120	206680	The 1,500 kilometer distance to the nearest SARS-2
206680	209640	related virus is like the distance from Washington, D.C.
209640	211200	to the Florida Everglades.
211200	213480	Imagine you're at dinner at a restaurant in North Bethesda
213480	215240	near the NIAID labs.
215240	218120	You get sick and you are told that the virus you caught
218120	220600	is only found in bats from the Everglades,
220600	222200	but it also happens to be understudied
222200	225440	at the laboratories you see outside the restaurant window.
225440	227000	That's what the market origin people
227000	228800	are asking you to believe.
228800	231160	Third, documented events add or related
231200	234600	to Wuhan Institute of Virology beginning in March 2019
234600	237160	are consistent with the expected activities
237160	240200	when a lab acquired infection has occurred.
240200	241920	This timeline includes unusual attention
241920	243800	from the Chinese Communist Party,
243800	247320	leading to the PLA physician soldier being put in charge.
247320	250800	Large tender requests to repair biosafety equipment,
250800	253640	a virus database disappearing in the middle of the night.
253640	256280	Large tender requests for a lab security force
256280	259680	to quote, handle foreign personnel, end quote.
259680	262960	Patents for a device to prevent a lab acquired infection.
262960	264560	Rumors in the virology community
264560	266480	of a new SARS virus in the lab.
266480	269680	30 vials of the three most dangerous viruses on the planet
269680	273200	being shipped illegally from a lab in Canada to WIV in March,
273200	275360	and then one of those pathogens being found
275360	278400	as a major contaminant in a BLC lab in December.
278400	280800	These events taken together are a classic example
280800	283480	of closing the barn door after the horse is left.
283480	285560	Fourth, the evidence that is found
285560	288200	in a natural zoonosis with respect to the animal host,
288200	291200	the virus, and the human are missing with COVID.
291200	295640	96,000 animals were tested and are negative for SARS-2.
295640	299400	43,000 blood samples from blood donors in Wuhan were tested.
299400	301520	A natural spillover like SARS-1
301520	304520	would have produced about 260 positives.
304520	307320	A lab accident would be zero, and of course,
307320	308840	zero is what is found.
308840	310040	With respect to the virus,
310040	313600	a spillover produces posterior diversity in the virus genome.
313600	315040	A lab leak does not.
315040	318040	SARS-2 has no posterior diversity.
318040	320360	Natural spillovers, as Dr. Gary indicated this morning,
320360	321840	involve multiple markets.
321840	324000	SARS-1 began in southern China,
324000	326680	had 11 spillovers in 11 different markets
326680	328960	in nine different cities.
328960	332800	Christian Anderson, the proximal origin of SARS-2,
332800	336360	said SARS-2 was one person being infected with one animal.
336360	337800	I agree.
337800	341080	Fifth, the genome of SARS-2 has eight features found
341080	344720	in a synthetic virus that are not found in natural viruses.
344720	346920	The probability that SARS-2 came from nature
346920	349920	based on these features is one in a billion.
349920	351640	These features are the backbone,
351640	354560	the receptor binding domain, the furan cleavage site,
354560	356800	the genetics of the furan cleavage site,
356800	361160	the number, location, and pattern of cloning sites
361160	363880	in SARS-2 that use the Barrick cloning method
363880	365560	and the orphate gene.
365560	367240	Based on SARS-2 cloning sites,
367240	370560	I predicted how SARS-2 could be made in the laboratory.
370560	373200	A year later, Barrick used the predicted steps
373200	375760	to make an infectious clone of SARS-2.
375760	379200	These same features were described in a 2018 DARPA grant
379200	381080	by WIV and US scientists.
381080	382160	With respect to the grant,
382160	386360	SARS-2 had the proposed backbone from the proposed region
386360	389240	in China, the proposed adaption to human killing,
389240	391760	the proposed diversity from SARS-1,
391760	393760	the proposed noceum cleavage site,
393760	395600	number, location, and pattern,
395600	398320	the proposed human cleavage site
398320	400680	at the proposed S1, S2 junction.
401880	403240	Let's close with a thought experiment.
403240	405520	Since 2018, do you think a market spillover
405520	408200	of a coronavirus could have happened in Wuhan?
408200	411160	Dr. Dasek and Xi have studied coronavisors for a decade
411160	412440	and they said no.
412440	413600	How do I know that?
413600	416680	Because they used Wuhan residents as control for a study
416680	418800	looking for antibodies in coronaviruses
418800	421080	in people living in your bad caves in southern China.
421080	423160	The rural residents had a 3% rate,
423160	425080	Wuhan residents had zero.
425080	428040	Let's flip that and ask the reverse question.
428040	429880	Do you think a lab acquired infection
429880	431120	could begin in Wuhan,
431120	433120	a city with the world's leading laboratory
433120	434960	collecting coronavirus from nature,
434960	437120	doing synthetic biology on coronaviruses,
437120	440200	doing petri dish and animal research on coronavirus
440200	441880	with a bat colony for testing,
441880	444960	and that had written a blueprint to make a coronavirus
444960	448480	that had seven unique features found in SARS-CoV-2?
448480	450600	I'll let you answer that question yourself.
450600	453360	I have a number of specific reforms I believe
453360	455280	should be implemented and I would be happy
455280	457680	to discuss them during the questioning.
457680	460320	What happens if we have these hearings and nothing happens?
460320	461920	The one is the virology right now
461920	465320	is testing a Nipah virus in a synthetic clone.
465320	469600	This is a U.S. CDC bioterrorism agent.
469600	471800	It kills three out of four people.
471800	473640	A lab leak with an airborne Nipah virus
473640	476240	would quickly within weeks disrupt food and energy
476240	479600	distribution, fire and police services, medical care.
479600	481760	My analysis of this tipping point event
481760	485440	is that it would set back civilization about 250 years.
485440	487200	The work of this committee is critical.
487200	490320	If we now fail to act with the knowledge we have history,
490320	492960	if it can still be recorded, we'll judge us poorly.
492960	494240	Thank you for your time.
501560	503560	Thank you.
503560	505640	Professor of chemistry and chemical biology
505640	507200	at Rutgers University.
507200	509280	He also serves as the laboratory director
509280	510600	for the Waxman Institute.
