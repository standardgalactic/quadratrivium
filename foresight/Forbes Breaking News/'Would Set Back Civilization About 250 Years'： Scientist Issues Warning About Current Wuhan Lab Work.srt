1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
areas of medicine, including RNA chemistry,

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,680
coronavirus therapeutics.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:06,320
Before his current role, he was a member

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,520
of the Department of Pathology

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,720
at the Stanford University School of Medicine.

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,880
Dr. Quay, welcome to the committee.

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,280
You are now recognized for your opening statement.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,080
Committee Chair, Senator Peters,

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,880
Ranking Member, Senator Paul.

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,040
Committee members, invited participants,

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,600
ladies and gentlemen.

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,280
I am a physician scientist and have a 50 year career

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,800
spanning academic medical research,

14
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,520
biotechnology, and scientific fraud investigation.

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,080
My biography summarizes my career.

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:39,360
I speak today, however, as an independent scientist.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,960
I do not receive any NIH or NIAID funding.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,080
Scientists dependent on NIH or NIAID funding

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,920
may have pressure to publicly agree with orthodoxies

20
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,880
that privately they admit are wrong.

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,080
My approach to the COVID pandemic origin

22
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,480
that killed 20 million plus people

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,440
caused $20 trillion in economic damage

24
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,800
is based on six approaches to the data and the events.

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,840
I'll start with something Dr. Gary said privately.

26
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,600
Quote, someone should tell nature,

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,120
meaning the British Journal,

28
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,160
that the fish market probably did not start

29
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,160
to outbreak, end quote.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,160
I agree with Dr. Gary.

31
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,600
Unfortunately, one reason we are having these hearings

32
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,440
is that the public statements of many virologists

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,400
have not been congruent with their private conversations.

34
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,640
In any case, I'll describe the six approaches

35
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,120
to the question that all support a lab leak as a source

36
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,680
and can go deeper into each of those with questions.

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,320
First, the virus was spreading in Wuhan

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,240
and around the world in the fall of 2019,

39
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,560
months before the first case in the Hunan seafood market.

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,200
This is supported by 14 observations or evidence.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,320
The evidence includes the calculation of the time

42
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,280
to the most recent common ancestor,

43
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,240
hospital overloads in Wuhan,

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,560
antibodies in patients from Italy, Spain and the US,

45
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,720
wastewater samples from Brazil,

46
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,840
sick athletes at the October Wuhan Military Games,

47
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,240
school closings in Wuhan,

48
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,480
and dozens of documented patients.

49
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,280
This dismisses out of hand the market as the origin.

50
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
But second, let's look at the market data.

51
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,720
The human infections, the animal samples,

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,520
and the environmental specimens,

53
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,680
these generate eight observations.

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
No infected animals in the market

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,800
or the supply chain were infected.

56
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,080
No infected wildlife vendors had SARS.

57
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,000
All human infections are the non-ancestral lineage B.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,280
The environmental specimens with animal DNA have no SARS-2.

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,320
One vendor had animals from Southern China

60
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,680
where SARS-2 came from,

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,480
but this vendor and his animals are negative for SARS-2.

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,120
Now, only one of 14 environmental samples

63
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,440
with raccoon dog DNA contains SARS reads,

64
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,440
and that contains one read out of 210 million.

65
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,160
13 of the 14 raccoon dog DNA specimens had no SARS-2.

66
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,560
With SARS-1, literally 100% of the market animals

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,680
were infected.

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,120
I frankly think it is shameful for scientists

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,160
to mislead journalists in the public

70
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,280
saying these data I just described are evidence

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,320
raccoon dogs were infected with SARS-2.

72
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,480
This is why trust in science is broken.

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,040
None of these data are consistent

74
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,200
with an infected animal passing SARS-2

75
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,120
to a human at the market.

76
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,680
The 1,500 kilometer distance to the nearest SARS-2

77
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,640
related virus is like the distance from Washington, D.C.

78
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,200
to the Florida Everglades.

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,480
Imagine you're at dinner at a restaurant in North Bethesda

80
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,240
near the NIAID labs.

81
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,120
You get sick and you are told that the virus you caught

82
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,600
is only found in bats from the Everglades,

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,200
but it also happens to be understudied

84
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,440
at the laboratories you see outside the restaurant window.

85
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,000
That's what the market origin people

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,800
are asking you to believe.

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,160
Third, documented events add or related

88
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,600
to Wuhan Institute of Virology beginning in March 2019

89
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,160
are consistent with the expected activities

90
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,200
when a lab acquired infection has occurred.

91
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,920
This timeline includes unusual attention

92
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,800
from the Chinese Communist Party,

93
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,320
leading to the PLA physician soldier being put in charge.

94
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,800
Large tender requests to repair biosafety equipment,

95
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,640
a virus database disappearing in the middle of the night.

96
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,280
Large tender requests for a lab security force

97
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:19,680
to quote, handle foreign personnel, end quote.

98
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,960
Patents for a device to prevent a lab acquired infection.

99
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
Rumors in the virology community

100
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
of a new SARS virus in the lab.

101
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,680
30 vials of the three most dangerous viruses on the planet

102
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,200
being shipped illegally from a lab in Canada to WIV in March,

103
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,360
and then one of those pathogens being found

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
as a major contaminant in a BLC lab in December.

105
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,800
These events taken together are a classic example

106
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,480
of closing the barn door after the horse is left.

107
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,560
Fourth, the evidence that is found

108
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,200
in a natural zoonosis with respect to the animal host,

109
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,200
the virus, and the human are missing with COVID.

110
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:55,640
96,000 animals were tested and are negative for SARS-2.

111
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,400
43,000 blood samples from blood donors in Wuhan were tested.

112
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,520
A natural spillover like SARS-1

113
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,520
would have produced about 260 positives.

114
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,320
A lab accident would be zero, and of course,

115
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,840
zero is what is found.

116
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,040
With respect to the virus,

117
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:13,600
a spillover produces posterior diversity in the virus genome.

118
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,040
A lab leak does not.

119
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,040
SARS-2 has no posterior diversity.

120
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,360
Natural spillovers, as Dr. Gary indicated this morning,

121
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,840
involve multiple markets.

122
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
SARS-1 began in southern China,

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,680
had 11 spillovers in 11 different markets

124
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,960
in nine different cities.

125
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
Christian Anderson, the proximal origin of SARS-2,

126
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,360
said SARS-2 was one person being infected with one animal.

127
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,800
I agree.

128
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,080
Fifth, the genome of SARS-2 has eight features found

129
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,720
in a synthetic virus that are not found in natural viruses.

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,920
The probability that SARS-2 came from nature

131
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,920
based on these features is one in a billion.

132
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,640
These features are the backbone,

133
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,560
the receptor binding domain, the furan cleavage site,

134
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
the genetics of the furan cleavage site,

135
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,160
the number, location, and pattern of cloning sites

136
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,880
in SARS-2 that use the Barrick cloning method

137
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,560
and the orphate gene.

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,240
Based on SARS-2 cloning sites,

139
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,560
I predicted how SARS-2 could be made in the laboratory.

140
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,200
A year later, Barrick used the predicted steps

141
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,760
to make an infectious clone of SARS-2.

142
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,200
These same features were described in a 2018 DARPA grant

143
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,080
by WIV and US scientists.

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,160
With respect to the grant,

145
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,360
SARS-2 had the proposed backbone from the proposed region

146
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,240
in China, the proposed adaption to human killing,

147
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,760
the proposed diversity from SARS-1,

148
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,760
the proposed noceum cleavage site,

149
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,600
number, location, and pattern,

150
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,320
the proposed human cleavage site

151
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,680
at the proposed S1, S2 junction.

152
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,240
Let's close with a thought experiment.

153
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,520
Since 2018, do you think a market spillover

154
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,200
of a coronavirus could have happened in Wuhan?

155
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,160
Dr. Dasek and Xi have studied coronavisors for a decade

156
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,440
and they said no.

157
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,600
How do I know that?

158
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,680
Because they used Wuhan residents as control for a study

159
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,800
looking for antibodies in coronaviruses

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,080
in people living in your bad caves in southern China.

161
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,160
The rural residents had a 3% rate,

162
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,080
Wuhan residents had zero.

163
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,040
Let's flip that and ask the reverse question.

164
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,880
Do you think a lab acquired infection

165
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,120
could begin in Wuhan,

166
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,120
a city with the world's leading laboratory

167
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,960
collecting coronavirus from nature,

168
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
doing synthetic biology on coronaviruses,

169
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,200
doing petri dish and animal research on coronavirus

170
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,880
with a bat colony for testing,

171
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,960
and that had written a blueprint to make a coronavirus

172
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,480
that had seven unique features found in SARS-CoV-2?

173
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,600
I'll let you answer that question yourself.

174
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,360
I have a number of specific reforms I believe

175
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,280
should be implemented and I would be happy

176
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,680
to discuss them during the questioning.

177
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,320
What happens if we have these hearings and nothing happens?

178
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,920
The one is the virology right now

179
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,320
is testing a Nipah virus in a synthetic clone.

180
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,600
This is a U.S. CDC bioterrorism agent.

181
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
It kills three out of four people.

182
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,640
A lab leak with an airborne Nipah virus

183
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,240
would quickly within weeks disrupt food and energy

184
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,600
distribution, fire and police services, medical care.

185
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,760
My analysis of this tipping point event

186
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,440
is that it would set back civilization about 250 years.

187
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,200
The work of this committee is critical.

188
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,320
If we now fail to act with the knowledge we have history,

189
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,960
if it can still be recorded, we'll judge us poorly.

190
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
Thank you for your time.

191
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,560
Thank you.

192
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,640
Professor of chemistry and chemical biology

193
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,200
at Rutgers University.

194
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
He also serves as the laboratory director

195
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,600
for the Waxman Institute.
