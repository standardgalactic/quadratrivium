 Dr. David Relman, a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Rutgers University and the laboratory director for the Waxman Institute, provided testimony to the U.S. Senate regarding the origins of SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Here's a summary of his key points:

1. **Lab Leak Evidence**: Dr. Relman outlined several lines of evidence that suggest a laboratory leak as a possible origin for SARS-CoV-2. These include:
   - The absence of any direct zoonotic link to an animal reservoir, as over 96,000 animals were tested without finding the virus.
   - Blood samples from 43,000 blood donors in Wuhan showed zero positives for SARS-2, which would be expected if the virus had spilled over naturally.
   - The lack of posterior diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is characteristic of a lab-created virus rather than a natural zoonosis.

2. **Genetic Features**: He mentioned eight genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 that are consistent with laboratory manipulation and are not found in naturally occurring coronaviruses. The probability of these features arising naturally is extremely low, estimated at one in a billion.

3. **DARPA Grant Prediction**: Dr. Relman highlighted a 2018 DARPA grant that proposed many of the genetic characteristics seen in SARS-CoV-2, including the backbone, adaptations for human killing, and cloning sites, which were later used to create an infectious clone of the virus by researchers including those from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

4. **Market Spillover vs. Lab Leak**: Dr. Relman contrasted the likelihood of a natural market spillover with that of a lab leak, noting that scientists from WIV, who have been studying coronaviruses for a decade, stated there were no coronavirus antibodies in Wuhan residents, which would be expected if there had been a spillover event in that city.

5. **Urgency for Investigation**: He emphasized the importance of investigating the origins of SARS-CoV-2 thoroughly to understand whether it emerged from nature or leaked from a laboratory. He also warned about the potential risks of another lab leak involving a different but equally dangerous virus, such as Nipah virus, which could have catastrophic consequences for global civilization.

6. **Call to Action**: Dr. Relman urged the senators to take immediate action based on the evidence presented, stressing that history would likely judge inaction harshly if a thorough investigation did not follow.

In essence, Dr. Relman's testimony suggests that the available evidence points more strongly toward the possibility of a lab leak origin for SARS-CoV-2 than a natural zoonotic spillover and calls for further investigation into this matter.
