00:00.000 --> 00:11.520
Hey, so does anyone remember Jurassic Park?

00:11.520 --> 00:14.320
Jurassic Park is a film about many things.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.520
Dinosaurs obviously quite a big one, but then it's also about the risks of unchecked

00:17.520 --> 00:22.280
science, the value of fatherhood, paying your software engineers a representative salary

00:22.280 --> 00:28.320
that so destroy everything you know and love, and, most harrowing of all, mathematics.

00:28.320 --> 00:34.080
Elegantly summarizing the last half-century on the topic with its iconic line, life, uh,

00:34.080 --> 00:38.720
finds a way, Jurassic Park introduced a blockbuster audience to the subfield of mathematics known

00:38.720 --> 00:40.400
as chaos theory.

00:40.400 --> 00:45.200
You know, the butterfly effect, small changes leading to large changes, ergo, dinosaur-themed

00:45.200 --> 00:46.760
butt-goat splat.

00:46.760 --> 00:50.920
But did it strike anyone else as odd how certain Dr. Malcolm was in his predictions about something

00:50.920 --> 00:54.120
that he himself argued was unpredictable?

00:54.120 --> 00:57.080
How did he actually know it wouldn't have turned out fine?

00:57.080 --> 00:58.760
Where were the calculations?

00:58.760 --> 01:01.880
Could it be that he couldn't predict anything after all?

01:01.880 --> 01:05.560
I knew he wasn't a real mathematician, mathematicians don't have sex appeal.

01:05.560 --> 01:09.360
In truth, there are some things we can predict with considerable precision.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.240
We know how well a plane will fly before it even takes off.

01:12.240 --> 01:15.200
We know where the planets will be millions of years into the future.

01:15.200 --> 01:19.840
And we know Paul the Lever, Cronk, must inevitably be followed by...

01:19.840 --> 01:24.600
Wrong Lever!

01:30.600 --> 01:32.520
Why do I even have that Lever?

01:32.520 --> 01:36.840
Anyway, hey, so does anyone remember Foundation?

01:39.960 --> 01:45.120
Foundation is a book series written by acclaimed science fiction author Isaac Asimov.

01:45.120 --> 01:50.160
Depending on how long it takes me to make this video, it will be, is, or was also a TV

01:50.160 --> 01:56.280
series, created for Apple's new, current, or long-defunct streaming service, Apple TV.

01:56.280 --> 01:59.080
Many view Foundation as Asimov's magnum opus.

01:59.080 --> 02:03.320
Indeed, it beat Lord of the Rings to the Hugo Award for Best Ever Series.

02:03.320 --> 02:07.880
An award Asimov himself believed was created specifically for Lord of the Rings to win.

02:07.880 --> 02:11.760
Which is all the more amazing when you realise the central premise of the book is a mathematical

02:11.760 --> 02:12.760
theory.

02:12.760 --> 02:19.040
This time, though, it's less life finds a way, and more life doesn't.

02:19.040 --> 02:23.760
Asimov imagined a field of study called psycho-history, which would plug the current state of a galactic

02:23.760 --> 02:27.320
society into a model and predict its future.

02:27.320 --> 02:31.280
Foundation explores the consequences of psycho-history across hundreds of years, the tantalising

02:31.280 --> 02:34.920
prospect of society itself being predictable.

02:34.920 --> 02:38.160
But would psycho-history actually hold up in the real world?

02:38.160 --> 02:41.840
How do we square it with chaos theory in all those butterflies?

02:41.840 --> 02:45.760
As someone who knows a fair bit about maths, and, incidentally, someone with exceptionally

02:45.760 --> 02:50.800
low sex appeal, checkmate Spielberg, today I am on a mission to find out.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.520
I've assembled some of the latest research into predicting human behaviour with maths,

02:54.520 --> 02:58.280
along with the frightening reality of it that may already be happening, to understand where

02:58.280 --> 03:01.360
we're heading in the field of understanding where we're heading, as well as to learn

03:01.360 --> 03:05.200
what it takes to write fiction about prediction in the first place.

03:05.200 --> 03:10.480
So I predict you are going to sit right there for the next 50-ish minutes and join me as

03:10.480 --> 03:27.200
we ask, Foundation, are we predictable?

03:27.200 --> 03:32.000
This video contains major spoilers for the Foundation book series, as well as minor spoilers

03:32.000 --> 03:52.840
for the media currently on screen.

03:52.840 --> 03:59.000
Few other names, nay, few other words, are so laden with science fiction mystique.

03:59.000 --> 04:03.320
It almost sounds like a name from another planet, that of the planet being the Soviet

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
Union.

04:04.320 --> 04:08.240
Well, not quite, it was the Soviet Union's weird teenage phase when I hadn't quite

04:08.240 --> 04:12.840
decided what it wanted to be yet, but whatever you call it, it was where Isaac Asimov was

04:12.840 --> 04:14.000
born.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.920
And if you thought the where was unclear, don't get me started on the when.

04:17.920 --> 04:22.440
Nobody, neither Asimov nor his own parents, knew the exact date.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.640
The best they could do was arrange, so, without any better way to decide, Asimov chose his

04:26.640 --> 04:28.340
birthday himself.

04:28.340 --> 04:32.380
He went for the latest date possible, which, 25 years later, meant he was drafted into

04:32.380 --> 04:38.100
World War II because he was only just inside the required age bracket.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.580
Asimov's parents emigrated to the United States when he was three.

04:41.580 --> 04:46.500
They opened a sweet shop selling, among other things, pulp sci-fi magazines.

04:46.500 --> 04:50.140
No prizes for guessing where young Isaac found his influences.

04:50.140 --> 04:55.100
Hell bent on writing sci-fi, at age 18, Asimov started submitting stories to John W. Campbell's

04:55.100 --> 04:57.220
astounding science fiction.

04:57.220 --> 05:01.020
His first few were rejected, but Campbell insisted that Asimov should continue submitting

05:01.020 --> 05:04.860
to hone his craft, even agreeing to regular meetings together with the hope that one day

05:04.860 --> 05:06.940
he'd write something successful.

05:06.940 --> 05:10.820
I wish the employers who rejected me would do that, but it's not the 1930s anymore.

05:10.820 --> 05:16.020
Asimov's first published story appeared in 1939, but it was 1941's Nightfall that

05:16.020 --> 05:17.340
made his name.

05:17.340 --> 05:21.500
The story of a planet that has but one night every few millennia, where everyone goes mad

05:21.500 --> 05:26.820
because they don't know about stars, propelled him to sci-fi stardom.

05:26.940 --> 05:29.620
And from there, the guy went a bit nuts.

05:29.620 --> 05:35.220
Few authors in any genre have been so prolific, so inventive, and so influential.

05:35.220 --> 05:36.900
Take iRobot.

05:36.900 --> 05:42.060
Asimov found the robot subgenre a tired shadow, endlessly rehashing stories of creations turning

05:42.060 --> 05:46.580
on creator that did little Mary Shelley's Frankenstein hadn't done a hundred years earlier.

05:46.580 --> 05:50.060
He left it an ethically expansive world of new questions and possibilities that shape

05:50.060 --> 05:52.780
our treatment of real AI to this day.

05:52.780 --> 05:56.220
But then the film version came along and sent us all backwards again, soâ€¦

05:56.220 --> 05:57.220
Eh.

05:57.220 --> 06:01.460
iRobot exemplifies the emphasis Asimov puts on big ideas.

06:01.460 --> 06:06.820
It's a series of disconnected short stories that dissect a single topic from many angles,

06:06.820 --> 06:10.460
poking and prodding his three laws of robotics to find the holes still present in a system

06:10.460 --> 06:14.020
that does prevent robot uprisings.

06:14.020 --> 06:18.540
The last question, possibly my favourite short story of all time, is similar.

06:18.540 --> 06:22.500
Humanity returns to one question over and over in otherwise disparate vignettes throughout

06:22.500 --> 06:26.900
the future, and is a pretty giant question to put it mildly.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.900
But we aren't answering that one today.

06:28.900 --> 06:32.020
Still a big one, but not that big.

06:32.020 --> 06:36.140
Even my hubris has limits.

06:36.140 --> 06:39.940
In 1941, Asimov was working at the Philadelphia Dockyard.

06:39.940 --> 06:42.660
He hadn't had much time for writing.

06:42.660 --> 06:46.340
He needed something new to show John Campbell in their upcoming meeting, something to blow

06:46.340 --> 06:49.740
him away, but what?

06:49.740 --> 06:52.340
Although he wasn't writing, he had been reading.

06:52.340 --> 06:56.500
Specifically, reading Edward Gibbons' history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire,

06:56.500 --> 07:00.740
a six-volume epic charting the fall of Rome and the factors responsible.

07:00.740 --> 07:04.820
This gave him an idea, and led to a meeting that must have gone something like,

07:04.820 --> 07:23.420
Alright Isaac, we need a new idea for a killer sapphire story.

07:23.420 --> 07:28.620
Nobody had properly attempted a galactic empire before, much less than a count of its destruction.

07:28.620 --> 07:32.260
We have foundation to thank for the empire in Star Wars, for instance, at least that's

07:32.260 --> 07:33.900
what Asimov believed.

07:33.900 --> 07:38.780
And being a space opera to film more recently than the 1970s, the Foundation TV show takes

07:38.780 --> 07:42.820
obvious influence from Star Wars in return, proving we're all living in a big cultural

07:42.820 --> 07:43.820
oraborus.

07:43.820 --> 07:48.460
But Asimov wanted to go further than simply transposing the fall of Rome into space.

07:48.460 --> 07:51.900
Gibbons theories had struck a chord with his love of examining human progress at the grandest

07:51.900 --> 07:57.340
scale, and he couldn't help but ask himself, what if the fall had been predicted?

07:57.340 --> 08:01.420
If, according to Gibbons, there were such clear factors in hindsight, would it not be possible

08:01.460 --> 08:04.380
for someone to notice them at the time?

08:04.380 --> 08:09.540
Combining the idea with his love for all things technological, Asimov went beyond even that.

08:09.540 --> 08:12.740
What if someone applied the scientific method to such an insight?

08:12.740 --> 08:17.260
What if they were able to turn history into a robust predictive science?

08:17.260 --> 08:21.800
He called it psychohistory, that branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions

08:21.800 --> 08:26.860
of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli.

08:26.860 --> 08:29.460
Psychohistory can't predict an individual's behaviour.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.740
It studies dynamics in aggregate.

08:31.740 --> 08:35.300
The more people involved, the more accurate it becomes.

08:35.300 --> 08:39.300
Asimov likened it to physical systems like gases which we'll look at in more detail

08:39.300 --> 08:40.300
later.

08:40.300 --> 08:45.180
Discrete particles, humans, move in any which way they like, but the emergent flow of institutions

08:45.180 --> 08:48.620
and incentive structures is highly predictable.

08:48.620 --> 08:53.580
In universe, psychohistory is the invention of mathematician Harry Selden, who is very

08:53.580 --> 08:55.700
much Asimov's self-insert.

08:55.700 --> 09:00.780
He predicts the Galactic Empire will fall into chaos for 30,000 years, but creates a plan

09:00.780 --> 09:06.060
to shorten that dark age to only 1,000 by establishing the Foundation, a new settlement

09:06.060 --> 09:07.700
at the edge of the galaxy.

09:07.700 --> 09:12.340
Initially, we're told the Foundation's task is to compile all knowledge into an encyclopedia

09:12.340 --> 09:18.220
galactica, preserving it beyond the decline, but Selden's true plan was much more subtle.

09:18.220 --> 09:22.340
He placed the Foundation in precisely the right spot to course correct the future evolution

09:22.340 --> 09:27.140
of the galaxy, meeting a series of pivotal events known as Selden crises.

09:27.140 --> 09:31.380
It would prevail against these crises not through the acts of great men or random chance, but

09:31.380 --> 09:36.100
the inevitable march of social trends.

09:36.100 --> 09:40.700
In 1942, Asimov published the first story set in the Foundation universe.

09:40.700 --> 09:46.380
It and four others were later combined into the full-length novel Foundation in 1951.

09:46.380 --> 09:50.740
Then came Foundation and Empire in 52 and Second Foundation in 53.

09:50.820 --> 09:54.740
Asimov returned to the series much later, adding two sequels and two prequels in the

09:54.740 --> 09:59.620
80s and 90s, thus completing the Foundation...septilogy?

09:59.620 --> 10:03.660
I have the main trilogy in book form, and it might well be the most gorgeous-looking book

10:03.660 --> 10:04.660
I own.

10:04.660 --> 10:09.060
Oh, shiny.

10:09.060 --> 10:14.140
Much like iRobot, the series challenges its premise from multiple angles across a long-disconnected

10:14.140 --> 10:15.140
time span.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.420
Here's a good example.

10:17.420 --> 10:21.780
At one point in the second book, the Foundation has defeated every enemy except the remnants

10:21.780 --> 10:26.820
of the Old Empire, still powerful enough to crush the Foundation's feeble military.

10:26.820 --> 10:28.260
But they needn't worry.

10:28.260 --> 10:31.180
The Empire is in a stalemate with itself.

10:31.180 --> 10:36.100
In short, any general who conquers a Foundation would become a threat to the Emperor himself,

10:36.100 --> 10:38.380
so the Emperor can't allow this to happen.

10:38.380 --> 10:42.300
The Foundation therefore does nothing and...wins.

10:42.300 --> 10:46.140
Asimov based this event on the real story of one Roman Emperor and his general, found

10:46.140 --> 10:48.540
in decline and fall.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.860
Writing a series like this must have been immensely challenging.

10:51.860 --> 10:57.540
Its characters are fleeting and ineffectual, its focus sociological rather than psychological.

10:57.540 --> 11:01.060
And that's not even touching on how one can create an entertaining story where everything

11:01.060 --> 11:02.900
is preordained right from the beginning.

11:02.900 --> 11:08.540
Sure, fiction is full of structure like character arcs, climaxes and resolutions and brick jokes.

11:08.540 --> 11:09.540
What's a brick joke?

11:09.540 --> 11:13.660
You know what, it's not important right now, we'll get to it later.

11:13.660 --> 11:16.940
But canon structure built on mathematical prediction really work.

11:16.940 --> 11:21.620
Well, I'll be diving into this in more detail in part 6, so pin that thought.

11:21.620 --> 11:27.940
The effect of writing Foundation as such is that, well, it has some issues.

11:27.940 --> 11:32.300
With a few notable exceptions, the characters have less dimension than a piece of string,

11:32.300 --> 11:35.740
and the prose is brimming with more Technobabble than baby Apex Twin.

11:35.740 --> 11:40.020
Admittedly, Asimov Technobabble is my kryptonite, so I'm good with it, but you shouldn't go

11:40.020 --> 11:43.380
dashing out to read it if you have different sensibilities.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.780
He's famous for his ideas, alright?

11:45.780 --> 11:49.660
Those ideas did, however, make Foundation an enormous success.

11:49.660 --> 11:54.460
Along with winning the Best ever series award, it cemented Asimov as THE great science fiction

11:54.460 --> 11:55.620
writer.

11:55.620 --> 11:57.540
Its impact is extensive.

11:57.540 --> 11:59.740
Science fiction hasn't been the same since.

11:59.740 --> 12:04.420
It shaped Dune, Star Wars, Hitchhiker, it was in the glovebox of Elon Musk's space

12:04.420 --> 12:06.500
Tesla for crying out loud.

12:06.500 --> 12:11.340
Further afield, Nobel Prize winner Paul Crouppen credits it with pushing him into economics.

12:11.340 --> 12:17.180
The closest field to psycho-history you could find in the real world, but can we do better?

12:17.180 --> 12:25.180
Let's get to the meat of this video and ask, is Asimov's psycho-history actually possible?

12:25.180 --> 12:30.020
And for that, I'm afraid we need to use math.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.220
Hot take.

12:44.220 --> 12:46.220
Mathematics is in many things.

12:46.220 --> 12:50.300
I hesitate to say everything because some smart ass in the comments is gonna ask, what

12:50.300 --> 12:56.380
about the set of all things that aren't mathematics and cause some kind of paradox, but I digress.

12:56.380 --> 13:00.780
Maybe I'm biased, but maths helps us understand so much and has opened so many doors for our

13:00.780 --> 13:04.940
modern world that it might well be humankind's greatest ever invention.

13:04.940 --> 13:10.300
Science is maths, engineering is maths, economics is maths, politics is maths, video games are

13:10.620 --> 13:15.820
languages maths, if you squinted it, even music is maths, but you've all heard that one already.

13:15.820 --> 13:21.260
We use maths in all its forms to understand the world, often with eerily good results.

13:21.260 --> 13:25.980
For example, we began by describing real world shapes with real world geometry,

13:25.980 --> 13:31.100
but with time, the maths dared us to imagine new geometries that didn't exist in our universe.

13:31.100 --> 13:35.260
Then, out of nowhere, some guy called Albert used those imaginary geometries to build the

13:35.260 --> 13:38.460
most accurate theory of physical motion we've ever known.

13:38.460 --> 13:42.380
You might recognise him, and that's because his theory correctly predicted the weird position of

13:42.380 --> 13:45.260
some stars during an eclipse and that shot him to stardom.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.380
I didn't even plan that.

13:48.380 --> 13:52.060
All in all, it's quite astonishing the power maths has to portray the real world.

13:52.700 --> 13:56.380
Not that I know. I'm writing my master's dissertation on category theory.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.180
Co-kill me now.

14:01.180 --> 14:05.660
And with Einstein's eclipse example, we see maths is particularly well suited to the

14:05.660 --> 14:10.460
field of prediction. Accurate observation and insightful theories mean we can forecast

14:10.460 --> 14:12.700
planetary dynamics with stunning precision.

14:13.420 --> 14:17.340
Take a look at Wikipedia's timeline of the far future, one of my favourite places on the

14:17.340 --> 14:22.460
internet, and you'll see just how many astronomical events we're aware of billions of years in advance.

14:23.180 --> 14:27.820
But before we can predict large things like planets and societies, we need to start small.

14:27.820 --> 14:29.500
So, here's a familiar example.

14:30.380 --> 14:33.820
Consider a cannon at ground level, pointing 45 degrees upwards,

14:33.820 --> 14:37.420
which instantaneously accelerates a cannonball to 100 meters per second.

14:38.140 --> 14:41.180
Factoring in air resistance, how far will the cannonball travel?

14:42.380 --> 14:46.220
Thanks to the work of generations of mathematicians and physicists before us,

14:46.220 --> 14:47.340
we don't even have to think.

14:47.900 --> 14:52.380
We can simply plug these numbers into a big formula and know for certain where the ball will land.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.740
Our prediction then aligns perfectly with reality.

14:56.540 --> 15:06.780
Oh, there must have been a random gust of virtual wind or something.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.620
Well, guess we won't be seeing that ball again.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.300
No matter, let's try once more.

15:16.860 --> 15:20.940
These same laws of physics are so effective, they tell us a building can withstand an

15:20.940 --> 15:23.420
earthquake before a single brick has been laid.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.300
Or how well a plane will fly without anything leaving the ground.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.500
In more general terms, this is mathematical modelling.

15:30.060 --> 15:34.060
Writing and solving equations to study real-world systems and predict their behaviour.

15:34.860 --> 15:38.620
Psycho-history brings mathematical modelling to bear against humanity itself.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.540
How would such a model work?

15:41.420 --> 15:44.620
Asimov's main inspiration was the ideal gas law.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.580
Gases are composed of trillions upon trillions of molecules,

15:47.580 --> 15:49.980
all bashing into each other like a microscopic mosh pit.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.740
Predicting each particle's behaviour is nigh on impossible,

15:53.740 --> 15:57.340
but put enough together and the discontinuities are averaged out,

15:57.340 --> 16:01.020
leaving only the overall movement of the gas in response to external pressures.

16:02.220 --> 16:05.020
There's a video on YouTube where Professor Dan Crisan compares

16:05.020 --> 16:07.740
psychohistory to heat transfer, a similar concept.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.660
At the microscopic level, we have what's called a stochastic process.

16:12.300 --> 16:16.780
Particles with more energy move faster and impart their energy to others through collisions,

16:16.780 --> 16:20.460
but in a given region of this size, these collisions are effectively random.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.300
Again though, zooming out reveals the emergent structure.

16:24.300 --> 16:26.380
Heat flows from hot areas to cold.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.980
At the macroscopic level then, there is a clear pattern in play.

16:30.780 --> 16:34.700
Because there are so many particles, we can assume the system is continuous

16:34.700 --> 16:38.780
and can write expressions known as differential equations to describe that pattern.

16:38.780 --> 16:43.020
The solution to such an equation, if it exists but that's a story for another time,

16:43.020 --> 16:45.500
then describes all those dynamics much more simply.

16:46.780 --> 16:48.620
But there is important nuance here.

16:49.180 --> 16:53.740
The equations assume continuity, that there is no smallest unit of the material,

16:53.740 --> 16:54.940
when in fact we know there is.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.900
Again, in practical terms, the particles are so small that our approximation is fine,

16:59.900 --> 17:04.220
but this does highlight how modellers must be aware of the assumptions inherent in their descriptions.

17:04.860 --> 17:08.380
We assumed that the outside of the material remains at a known temperature,

17:08.380 --> 17:10.860
that the material is of uniform density,

17:10.860 --> 17:15.180
that the laws of physics wouldn't change halfway through via sudden vacuum decay of the universe,

17:17.100 --> 17:19.180
psycho history may not be a law of physics,

17:19.900 --> 17:22.460
but that can't stop the power of mathematical models.

17:24.460 --> 17:29.020
The Prime Minister has announced the most drastic limits to our lives that the UK has

17:29.580 --> 17:31.420
ever seen in living memory.

17:31.420 --> 17:34.140
The NHS will be unable to handle it.

17:34.140 --> 17:36.860
A decision based on scientific projections

17:36.860 --> 17:40.860
for how many thousands the virus might kill in the coming months.

17:40.860 --> 17:45.180
Created scenarios will what might happen to the key metric of hospital admissions

17:45.180 --> 17:48.220
with three different assumptions on how quickly...

17:48.220 --> 17:51.660
Over the past two years, I've gone through several periods of near obsession

17:51.660 --> 17:54.300
following models of the Covid-19 pandemic,

17:54.300 --> 17:56.300
to the point that my mood on a given day

17:56.300 --> 17:59.660
would depend on how that day's Covid statistics affected their predictions.

18:00.300 --> 18:03.100
Unhealthy? Yeah, absolutely.

18:03.100 --> 18:05.580
I think at the darkest points I needed their assurance

18:05.580 --> 18:07.660
that there would be light at the end of the tunnel,

18:07.660 --> 18:10.060
but they weren't always predicting light, were they?

18:10.700 --> 18:13.180
My point is that population dynamics models,

18:13.180 --> 18:15.260
in this case for a virus population,

18:15.260 --> 18:17.500
held enormous sway over our lives recently.

18:18.060 --> 18:19.340
Their might is evident.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.100
Biological models make similar assumptions to physical ones.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.380
Ignore individuals, zoom out to approximate continuity.

18:27.100 --> 18:30.380
But because biological processes are arguably more complex

18:30.380 --> 18:32.380
and less controllable than physical ones,

18:32.380 --> 18:33.580
we need more assumptions.

18:34.220 --> 18:37.100
This is why pandemic models disagree so often.

18:37.100 --> 18:39.020
The maths never gives wrong answers.

18:39.100 --> 18:40.460
We just feed it the wrong questions.

18:41.660 --> 18:44.300
Outside of pandemics, we've used biological modelling

18:44.300 --> 18:46.620
to understand predator-prey interactions

18:46.620 --> 18:48.860
and humanity's effects on ecosystems,

18:48.860 --> 18:50.860
such as figuring out sustainable fishing rates.

18:51.420 --> 18:53.500
We're even simulating evolution itself.

18:54.140 --> 18:57.260
Mathematical biology has exploded over the last half century.

18:57.820 --> 19:01.580
More and more, we're finding biological systems are well suited to modelling,

19:01.580 --> 19:05.500
suggesting psycho-history isn't as far removed from reality as it first seems.

19:06.220 --> 19:08.460
I think if Asimov were writing Foundation Today,

19:08.460 --> 19:11.420
he'd base psycho-history more on this than the physical sciences.

19:12.140 --> 19:14.540
And as evidence, I present Jurassic Park.

19:15.420 --> 19:18.620
A few of you may be surprised to learn that the film is based on a book.

19:19.180 --> 19:23.260
Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park goes much harder into the biological maths,

19:23.260 --> 19:25.660
and is so far the only instance I've ever seen

19:25.660 --> 19:28.540
of a normal distribution being a major fictional plot point.

19:30.220 --> 19:31.260
Plot point.

19:31.260 --> 19:34.540
But Crichton took a much dimmer view of prediction than Asimov.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.300
His mathematician self-insert is Dr. Ian Malcolm.

19:38.780 --> 19:41.180
And we all know what he would think of psycho-history, don't we?

19:44.140 --> 19:45.660
That is one big pile of shit.

19:57.180 --> 19:58.940
In this land of many mysteries,

19:58.940 --> 20:03.100
it's a strange fact that the largest legends seem to collect around the smallest creatures.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.940
One of these is a mousy little rodent called the Lemming.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.540
Here's an actual living legend.

20:10.540 --> 20:14.140
For it's set of this tiny animal that it commits mass suicide

20:14.140 --> 20:15.900
by rushing into the sea in droves.

20:21.100 --> 20:25.100
In 1958, Disney put out a film called White Wilderness,

20:25.100 --> 20:27.740
a documentary of life at the poles.

20:28.620 --> 20:30.860
These days, it's infamous for one scene.

20:31.580 --> 20:33.740
Contrary to the narrator's insistence,

20:33.740 --> 20:37.660
the Lemmings were not voluntarily jumping from the cliff in a mass suicide attempt.

20:38.460 --> 20:39.180
They were pushed.

20:39.740 --> 20:41.020
The whole thing was fabricated.

20:42.140 --> 20:45.340
White Wilderness didn't invent the legend of suicidal Lemmings,

20:45.340 --> 20:47.180
that was part of existing folklore.

20:47.180 --> 20:48.780
But it did bring it to the masses.

20:49.500 --> 20:53.260
Nowadays, the word Lemming is synonymous with stupidity, death wishes,

20:53.260 --> 20:56.140
and a pretty good video game for the 1990s that,

20:56.140 --> 20:58.140
unfortunately still perpetuates the myth.

20:59.660 --> 21:03.820
The myth arose due to extraordinary volatility in Lemming populations.

21:03.820 --> 21:07.740
One year, a plague, the next near extinction, with no clear pattern.

21:08.620 --> 21:12.060
With admittedly a few documented cases of Lemmings accidentally

21:12.060 --> 21:14.300
driving each other off cliffs during migration,

21:14.300 --> 21:16.620
mass suicide appeared the only explanation.

21:17.660 --> 21:21.420
Though we're still not certain, today we have a much better guess.

21:21.420 --> 21:23.660
Thanks, once again, to mathematics.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.860
This is the Logistic Growth Map.

21:27.660 --> 21:30.540
It's one possible model we can use for animal populations.

21:31.180 --> 21:34.620
The population in year n is represented by xn,

21:34.620 --> 21:38.060
so the equation tells us how to update the population for next year.

21:38.060 --> 21:41.580
i.e. calculate xn plus 1, based on what it was last year.

21:42.300 --> 21:45.660
The term R here represents the basic growth rate,

21:45.660 --> 21:47.740
a measure of how quickly individuals reproduce.

21:49.260 --> 21:51.660
Given an initial population and a growth rate,

21:51.660 --> 21:54.460
we can hit the population with this map over and over again

21:54.460 --> 21:55.980
to see how it develops year on year.

21:56.620 --> 21:58.220
Notice it doesn't grow forever,

21:58.220 --> 22:01.260
as the 1-xn term represents pressure from the environment

22:01.260 --> 22:04.460
for the population to decline, such as a limit on food or space.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.940
You'll notice that for some values of R,

22:06.940 --> 22:09.260
the population eventually reaches a steady state.

22:09.820 --> 22:12.940
After some initial wobbling, it reaches a stable level,

22:12.940 --> 22:16.300
neither growing nor shrinking, as upward and downward pressures are balanced.

22:17.260 --> 22:20.300
For others, it might settle into a repeating pattern,

22:20.300 --> 22:23.420
up one year, down the next, oscillating between two values.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.220
We can plot this behaviour on a graph.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.180
The horizontal axis is the value of R,

22:29.180 --> 22:32.060
the vertical axis is the steady state we eventually reach.

22:32.700 --> 22:36.060
For R less than 1, all populations decline to extinction.

22:37.340 --> 22:41.660
For R between 1 and 3, all populations approach some steady non-zero value.

22:42.620 --> 22:45.340
Beyond 3, populations oscillate between two values.

22:45.340 --> 22:49.660
Extending further, we get oscillations between 4 values and so on.

22:50.220 --> 22:53.660
But beyond about 3.57, something rather silly happens.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.700
The population never approaches a steady value

22:56.700 --> 22:59.660
and instead jumps around unpredictably forever.

23:00.540 --> 23:06.140
And Dr. Ian Malcolm is licking his lips because we've just discovered chaos theory.

23:07.180 --> 23:09.100
Although Jurassic Park might give you the impression

23:09.100 --> 23:12.060
that chaos theory is for the cool kids who aren't doing serious maths,

23:12.060 --> 23:13.900
it is in fact a real field of study.

23:14.460 --> 23:17.020
I know because I took an exam in it last year.

23:17.020 --> 23:21.020
In 1961, Edward Lorenz was running calculations for weather forecasting

23:21.020 --> 23:22.940
on these newfangled things called computers.

23:23.820 --> 23:26.700
His forecast stored data to six decimal places.

23:27.260 --> 23:29.660
Lorenz wanted to run the same calculations again,

23:29.660 --> 23:33.020
but to save time, entered the data to only three decimal places.

23:33.900 --> 23:36.620
He was astonished to find the outcomes differed wildly.

23:37.180 --> 23:39.500
Sun became storms, storms became sun.

23:40.140 --> 23:43.900
Small changes in initial conditions made the entire system unpredictable.

23:44.860 --> 23:47.420
Lorenz published his findings in a paper that asked,

23:47.420 --> 23:51.660
does the flap of a butterfly swing in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas,

23:51.660 --> 23:54.060
enshrining the butterfly effect in the world's mind?

23:54.300 --> 23:59.500
It's also a great example of mathematicians making discoveries by being lazy.

24:00.140 --> 24:04.460
Chaotic systems like weather exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

24:05.020 --> 24:07.580
Despite being fully deterministic, that is,

24:07.580 --> 24:11.820
the future follows from the present by rigid laws, these systems appear random.

24:12.460 --> 24:15.100
You can't predict them without perfect measurements,

24:15.100 --> 24:16.940
which are effectively impossible to obtain.

24:18.060 --> 24:20.140
The logistic map is one such system.

24:20.780 --> 24:23.740
A growth rate beyond 3.57 produces chaos.

24:24.140 --> 24:26.620
Your predictions add the mercy of how precisely you know

24:26.620 --> 24:29.740
both the starting population and the reproduction rate,

24:29.740 --> 24:32.860
off by even one individual and you might as well be rolling dice.

24:33.820 --> 24:36.700
Here then, we find a potential solution to our lemming problem.

24:37.340 --> 24:40.380
Lemmings, you see, reproduce very quickly.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.460
The point is debated, but some estimates suggest their adjusted growth rate

24:44.460 --> 24:47.900
exceeds the chaos threshold, though usually in other models,

24:47.900 --> 24:50.620
I just used the logistic map as a simpler example.

24:50.700 --> 24:53.980
According to Wikipedia, lemmings are some of the few vertebrates

24:53.980 --> 24:57.660
which reproduce so quickly that their population fluctuations are chaotic.

24:58.460 --> 25:00.700
Hmm, and there's even a source for this claim.

25:01.580 --> 25:02.700
Fascinating.

25:02.700 --> 25:03.740
Thanks, Peter Turchin.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.740
Interesting name that.

25:05.740 --> 25:08.220
If lemming populations follow a suitable model,

25:08.220 --> 25:10.780
and if they do reproduce this quickly,

25:10.780 --> 25:14.540
then it seems reasonable for chaos theory to hold the true explanation.

25:15.500 --> 25:17.660
So if you take one thing from this video,

25:17.660 --> 25:21.100
let it be that lemmings only exists because of insatiable libido.

25:23.740 --> 25:27.500
Chaos theory may then be an insurmountable obstacle to psycho-history.

25:28.140 --> 25:30.300
If we can't predict the weather beyond a few days,

25:30.300 --> 25:33.580
what hope do we have to predict thousands of years of galactic society?

25:34.140 --> 25:35.980
If a butterfly can cause a tornado,

25:35.980 --> 25:38.300
why can't a single human change the course of history?

25:39.340 --> 25:41.820
But don't go thinking we've outwitted Asimov here,

25:41.820 --> 25:44.060
because Foundation asks the same question.

25:45.020 --> 25:48.780
The second half of Foundation and Empire introduces one of my favourite villains

25:48.780 --> 25:49.740
in all of literature.

25:50.380 --> 25:54.380
A space warlord forging a new empire from the ruins of the old,

25:54.380 --> 25:56.620
bringing countless star systems under his control

25:56.620 --> 25:59.020
and sowing paralyzing fear in those still standing.

25:59.660 --> 26:02.940
They call him The Mule, perhaps for his great strength.

26:03.900 --> 26:08.460
Citizens of the Foundation guess his rise to power must be the latest Seldon crisis,

26:08.460 --> 26:10.940
so they gather to listen to Seldon's hologram recording,

26:10.940 --> 26:14.380
which will tell them why they're destined to win and that they can sit back and relax.

26:15.100 --> 26:19.740
Everything goes a bit to pot when Seldon starts babbling about a non-existent civil war instead.

26:20.380 --> 26:20.780
Whoops.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.500
The Mule then conquers the entire Foundation.

26:24.540 --> 26:25.020
Whoops.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.940
We later learn the Mule's secret weapon is a genetic mutation,

26:28.940 --> 26:30.860
giving him some form of mind control.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.340
He can command others' emotions, manipulating them to build an empire for him.

26:36.220 --> 26:40.060
We also learn he was an unassuming clown called Magnifico the whole time.

26:40.060 --> 26:44.220
The protagonists only get to jump on him because one takes a genuine liking to him,

26:44.220 --> 26:46.860
and the Mule lets his guard down because he can't bring himself to interfere

26:46.860 --> 26:49.180
with the one piece of genuine affection anyone's ever felt for him

26:49.180 --> 26:51.980
in his life of disgust and derision that drove him to conquer the entire galaxy

26:51.980 --> 26:53.900
in a single-minded act of revenge for how it treated him.

26:55.180 --> 26:55.980
Well done, Azimov.

26:55.980 --> 26:57.420
You wrote a good character for once.

26:57.980 --> 27:01.980
Even more so because the Mule is Foundation's avatar for chaos theory,

27:01.980 --> 27:04.460
or at least the notion of it that existed in Azimov's time.

27:05.260 --> 27:09.820
Seldon did not and could not predict a random change to one person's DNA.

27:09.820 --> 27:13.420
That change nonetheless spiralled into a big old butterfly of an effect.

27:14.220 --> 27:18.380
Some critics have noted there are other aspects of chaos inherent in psycho history,

27:18.380 --> 27:19.500
such as technology.

27:20.060 --> 27:24.220
If Seldon could predict the date and impact of a galaxy-altering invention,

27:24.220 --> 27:26.460
he basically knew enough to invent it himself.

27:27.100 --> 27:30.780
Look at steampower or the internet and their radical impacts on our lives, for instance.

27:31.340 --> 27:35.660
Would someone living before the steam train have any hope of predicting modern social dynamics?

27:36.620 --> 27:38.860
But all hope is not yet lost.

27:38.860 --> 27:43.580
Because while chaos theory is a major hurdle, it's not always all it's cracked up to be.

27:44.300 --> 27:47.820
Even though I can't tell you exactly what the weather will do two weeks from now,

27:47.820 --> 27:51.500
I can reliably predict its average behaviour for quite a bit longer.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.820
For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, we'll see cold temperatures for the next few

27:55.820 --> 27:58.380
months before a gradual period of warming into the summer.

27:58.380 --> 28:01.340
Here in the UK, most of that period will be grey and miserable.

28:01.340 --> 28:05.420
There will be storms here or there, which may or may not be caused by colourful flying insects,

28:05.420 --> 28:08.460
but overall they will have little impact on most weather patterns.

28:09.740 --> 28:13.660
It's a bit like rolling dice. Each roll is chaotic, deterministic,

28:13.660 --> 28:19.180
but subject to incalculable tiny variations, yet enough together will always follow known statistics.

28:21.260 --> 28:25.580
Even one of the poster children for chaos theory, the Lorenza Tractor, features order

28:25.580 --> 28:31.180
among the chaos. It's a picture of airflow under convection inside a box. While the parts of the

28:31.180 --> 28:36.380
air particles vary wildly, they still remain on the two main swells. In other words,

28:36.380 --> 28:40.460
the specific trajectories can't be predicted, but the overall movement can.

28:41.420 --> 28:46.620
Again, we're talking about averages in the aggregate. One atom is highly unlikely to

28:46.620 --> 28:52.300
change the directions of trillions upon trillions. That's not to say it's impossible though,

28:52.300 --> 28:57.020
but only for some systems, and it's hard to tell whether a given real world phenomenon is one of

28:57.020 --> 29:03.660
them. But Harry Selden knew it was still a possibility. He accounted for it. Despite the

29:03.660 --> 29:10.220
mules won in a quadrillion paradigm shift, Selden still had the last laugh. To see how we need to

29:10.220 --> 29:16.060
move beyond atoms and lemmings. After all, they may be predictable, but we humans are so much more

29:16.060 --> 29:32.380
advanced. Right? Why don't we play a fun game of rock, paper, scissors? I'll count us in,

29:32.460 --> 29:42.140
we'll throw our hands on go, and you let me know who won in the comments. Ready? Three, two, one, go.

29:45.660 --> 29:50.860
On the face of it, rock, paper, scissors is a random game. The choices are equally powerful,

29:50.860 --> 29:56.540
and there's no inherent reason to choose one over another. Much like dice, with many trials,

29:56.540 --> 30:01.340
the results should average out. One third of you should have lost to me, one third should have won,

30:01.340 --> 30:06.300
and one third should have drawn. If that's the case though, why are there rock, paper, scissors

30:06.300 --> 30:13.020
world champions? Yes, those exist. It's possible to consistently beat the odds because, in the hands

30:13.020 --> 30:18.540
of humans, the game isn't random at all. Skilled players pick up on patterns and ticks and second

30:18.540 --> 30:23.900
guessing to exploit the flaws in their opponent's thought processes. It even worked with this video.

30:23.900 --> 30:28.380
If you know my patterns, you know I can't resist the temptation to make a terrible visual joke and

30:28.380 --> 30:33.900
would never throw Dwayne Johnson. On a more general level, our brains exhibit cognitive biases that

30:33.900 --> 30:38.460
make us more predictable than we'd like to believe, but I spoke about these at length in my diplomacy

30:38.460 --> 30:43.020
video so I'll say no more here. What we're interested in today is how we can cash in on

30:43.020 --> 30:47.740
these thought patterns with maths. And, perhaps unsurprisingly by now, there's a lot of scope

30:47.740 --> 30:54.300
here. Take, as a morbid example, crime. Unless they're taking specific steps to avoid it,

30:54.380 --> 30:59.020
criminals tend to commit crimes with a geographic pattern. When they commit multiple crimes,

30:59.020 --> 31:04.140
the pattern strengthens and we can use this to narrow down investigations. As one example,

31:04.140 --> 31:09.180
they may not act too close to home to avoid arousing suspicion, but don't want to put too

31:09.180 --> 31:13.900
much effort into travelling and hence have an upper limit on distance too. Put these into a

31:13.900 --> 31:19.100
formula and you generate a probability distribution that suggests the best places to find your suspects

31:19.180 --> 31:24.860
given their crime locations. This technique is called geographic profiling. On the rise for

31:24.860 --> 31:29.580
the last few decades, it's helped catch a fair number of serial criminals. Some have even used

31:29.580 --> 31:35.100
it to retroactively predict the home of Jack the Ripper. As another example, consider the flow of a

31:35.100 --> 31:41.820
crowd. Studies of ant swarms and fish shoals reveal that our movement isn't so different. We run on

31:41.820 --> 31:46.620
autopilots and there are simple rules behind our movement, so we can save mental energy for more

31:46.620 --> 31:51.420
important things like checking our phones. We can use these rules to design safer or more efficient

31:51.420 --> 31:56.380
buildings. My favourite example is that placing an obstacle in the middle of a large hall can

31:56.380 --> 32:01.980
actually improve traffic flow as it hacks like a roundabout. See America? It's completely natural.

32:03.340 --> 32:07.580
All this points to at least some capacity to predict human behaviour even at the level of

32:07.580 --> 32:12.780
individuals, which brings us to Asimov's next addition to the Foundation Universe, the second

32:12.780 --> 32:19.020
Foundation. In the third book of the main trilogy, we discover Selden established two foundations,

32:19.580 --> 32:25.180
one a blunt acts of technology and military might, the other a secretive puppet master scalpel.

32:25.740 --> 32:29.820
The second foundation was to develop psycho history beyond Selden's groundwork,

32:29.820 --> 32:33.580
making it more resilient to the whims of individuals and perhaps predicting actions

32:33.580 --> 32:38.380
at a more granular scale. To do this, they explored the science of the human mind,

32:38.380 --> 32:43.020
the ways it can be read and controlled. Unfortunately for this analysis, it does this

32:43.020 --> 32:49.100
by having its members all be telepathic. Bit of a cheat code there. When the mule threatens

32:49.100 --> 32:52.940
the Selden plan, the second foundation comes out of hiding to correct the aberration.

32:53.580 --> 32:58.460
By predicting and shifting the actions of single humans, the second foundation suggests a much

32:58.460 --> 33:05.340
finer version of psycho history and one that is self-correcting. But also telepathy, so yeah.

33:05.900 --> 33:11.740
Despite the highlighted cases, we're still pretty far off forecasting the future of individuals.

33:12.380 --> 33:16.540
Even if our brains exhibit patterns, our lives around them still appear for the most part

33:16.540 --> 33:21.180
too chaotic. Countless events every day shape our future in ways we may never know.

33:22.060 --> 33:26.700
We're forced then to retrace our steps back to psycho history proper, the prediction of

33:26.700 --> 33:31.820
larger incentive structures. With the mathematical tools we've developed, are we any closer to

33:31.820 --> 33:37.020
improving on Paul Krugman's substitutes of economics? Can we sidestep chaos theory to

33:37.020 --> 33:42.620
truly build a model for humanity? Well, this would be a pretty disappointing video if I hadn't found

33:42.620 --> 33:47.740
something, so ladies, gentlemen and others, please, put your hands together for the actual

33:47.740 --> 33:56.860
real-world manifestation of psycho history. Clio Dynamics. Alright, alright, I'll get to that,

33:56.860 --> 34:02.700
just let me explain what it is first. Guess I gotta cross Clio Dynamics off my controversial

34:02.700 --> 34:11.500
topics for a YouTube video bingo card. Coined in 2003, Clio Dynamics is the term for the field

34:11.500 --> 34:16.140
of study that mathematicalizes history. By collecting quantitative historical data,

34:16.140 --> 34:21.020
its aim is to use statistical and modelling techniques to find the laws that dictate societal

34:21.020 --> 34:26.460
progress. Much of the work on Clio Dynamics has been spearheaded by one man, Professor

34:26.460 --> 34:32.540
of Ecology, Anthropology and Mathematics at the University of Connecticut, Peter Turchin. Hold on.

34:36.620 --> 34:41.260
And there's even a source for this claim. Fascinating. Thanks, Peter Turchin.

34:42.220 --> 34:48.380
I swear I found these two things independently. Turchin's background is in Beatles. He cut

34:48.380 --> 34:51.900
his teeth studying their population dynamics, which of course we know all about now,

34:51.980 --> 34:57.420
and the dynamics of other species, like lemmings. And he does indeed suggest lemmings may be one

34:57.420 --> 35:02.060
of the few creatures exhibiting chaotic fluctuations. He moved on from ecology after

35:02.060 --> 35:06.380
deciding he knew everything there was to know about Beatles, now setting himself the loftier

35:06.380 --> 35:11.900
goal of studying humans. He believes that history, like biology, is ripe for being turned into

35:11.900 --> 35:18.140
mathematics, and founded the journal Clio Dynamics to begin the task. Turchin's notoriety rose in

35:18.140 --> 35:23.420
2010 when he announced that his work suggested a coming age of unrest in America. He became

35:23.420 --> 35:28.380
even more famous in 2020 because his 2010 prediction said that would be the year when things would

35:28.380 --> 35:36.140
get serious. Hmm. In Turchin's words, history as a subject is good at explaining the past.

35:36.860 --> 35:42.220
Too good, in fact, and he cites one historian who had collated 210 competing theories for the

35:42.220 --> 35:47.660
fall of Rome, making it incredibly difficult to choose between them. In my video Analyzing

35:47.660 --> 35:51.980
a Darkling Plane, I compared that book's portrayal of societal demise to the Bronze Age

35:51.980 --> 35:57.260
collapse, and we see a similar thing there. Theories ranging from spearmen emerging from the ocean,

35:57.260 --> 36:02.380
to earthquakes, to an overly complex society falling in on itself in a process historian

36:02.380 --> 36:07.740
Eric Klein calls systems collapse. This last one has a certain whiff of psycho history, if you ask me.

36:08.460 --> 36:13.580
Clio Dynamics takes such hypotheses, translates them into mathematical models, and tests them

36:13.580 --> 36:19.100
against databases spanning thousands of years. The hope is to identify the most plausible theories,

36:19.100 --> 36:24.380
and with them, the mathematical laws of history, much like we have laws of physics and, increasingly,

36:24.380 --> 36:30.460
laws of biology. Whether Clio Dynamics is really about predicting the future or only has use explaining

36:30.460 --> 36:36.860
past trends depends on where you look. Turchin sometimes says yes, but sometimes says no,

36:36.860 --> 36:41.260
citing some of the issues we've gone through already, while journalists representing his work

36:41.260 --> 36:45.820
side emphatically with yes. And while it lets you write clickbait headlines like

36:45.820 --> 36:51.100
the next decade could be even worse, can you really blame them? Because Clio Dynamics has

36:51.100 --> 36:56.460
borne fruit. Despite countless differences between cultures that could have chaos-style effects,

36:56.460 --> 37:02.540
there are, according to Turchin, consistent trends. Secular cycles are one such trend.

37:02.540 --> 37:07.660
Apparent rhythms in boom and bust across time, driven by processes like elite overproduction.

37:08.300 --> 37:13.020
Here, Clio Dynamics models suggest collapses are often preceded by a common social shift.

37:13.660 --> 37:18.060
Namely, the funneling of more people into elite positions than there are elite positions available.

37:18.780 --> 37:21.980
The theory goes that these shunned elites become the revolutionaries.

37:22.620 --> 37:26.700
Even if you claim not to be in the business of prediction, forming such a model leads you down

37:26.700 --> 37:31.580
that path. And yes, Turchin concludes that we're heading for the next crash as we speak.

37:32.220 --> 37:36.700
But he can't predict the spark. Only the accumulation of fuel it can ignite.

37:37.420 --> 37:43.820
Spoken like a true psycho-historian. As it happens, Foundation was a formative influence on Turchin.

37:43.820 --> 37:47.820
He surely sometimes believes he is making Seldon's dream a reality. But it's no

37:47.820 --> 37:52.380
surprise the man who considered chaotic lemmings has some criticisms of Asimov's predictive

37:52.380 --> 37:58.380
machinery. He says that chaos theory makes mules of all of us, wrecking any hope for true precision.

37:59.100 --> 38:02.940
He also takes issue with Seldon's insistence that his plan should remain a mystery.

38:03.900 --> 38:08.060
Asimov spends most of Second Foundation arguing that knowing psycho-history's

38:08.060 --> 38:13.020
prophecies ahead of time renders them useless. After coming out of hiding to defeat the mule,

38:13.020 --> 38:18.140
the Second Foundation must convince the galaxy it has itself been crushed, lest the Seldon plan go

38:18.140 --> 38:24.220
awry. In real life, this is called the uncertainty principle of the social sciences. Even with chaos

38:24.220 --> 38:28.540
in the mix, forecasting the weather won't change the weather. Make a prediction in economics,

38:28.540 --> 38:33.020
though, and you might bring about the crash you sought to prevent. Simplified to the point of

38:33.020 --> 38:37.820
irritating economists, that's all the field is. Things having value because they're forecast to

38:37.820 --> 38:42.860
have value. Game stop notwithstanding. But Turchin says clear dynamics can survive this,

38:42.860 --> 38:45.900
because who cares about one odd professor's thoughts on the future?

38:47.020 --> 38:52.780
The trouble is, quite a few people do. Right, you can bring back your pitchforks now.

38:54.700 --> 38:58.140
Historians have not taken kindly to a mathematician coming along to tell them

38:58.140 --> 39:02.300
they're all studying history wrong. And, weirdly, neither have the mathematicians.

39:02.300 --> 39:06.300
Now, I'm not qualified to say either way, but I've seen enough claims that

39:06.300 --> 39:11.420
Turchin's methodology is questionable to give them some weight. He's been accused of cherry

39:11.420 --> 39:15.660
picking data to suit his conclusions, for instance, and prophesising historical trends to

39:15.660 --> 39:21.580
shape policy recommendations has drawn someâ€¦ unwelcome comparisons. Plus, you can't ignore

39:21.580 --> 39:27.980
the survivorship bias. I can make a prediction that the world will end on the 9th of January

39:28.220 --> 39:33.900
2031, and I'll join the long list of very wrong doomsday profits throughout history.

39:34.780 --> 39:39.820
I hope. Turchin divined 2020, but we don't care about everyone who said 2019, do we?

39:40.380 --> 39:44.860
But far and away the most common critique is that reducing history to numbers removes all

39:44.860 --> 39:49.180
the nuance and context that's necessary to understand it at all. It's similar to the

39:49.180 --> 39:53.900
criticism leveled against creators of so-called mega-histories, accounts of the big picture

39:53.900 --> 39:58.060
which eschew the details in favour of high-level patterns. I need only mention guns,

39:58.060 --> 40:02.940
germs, and steel to be marked anti-history for life. In general, historians believe that

40:02.940 --> 40:07.900
society is simply too complex to predict. There are so many theories for the fall of Rome or

40:07.900 --> 40:11.980
the Bronze Age collapse because there are so many things that can affect it. Sure,

40:11.980 --> 40:16.300
we can plot a few of them on time series graphs, but none of them can ever come close to the full

40:16.300 --> 40:21.260
picture. I'm reminded here of the notorious study on the decline of modern music from a few

40:21.260 --> 40:27.180
years ago. It measured a few ill-chosen datasets without necessary context and called it a day.

40:27.180 --> 40:30.780
I direct you towards YouTuber Tantacruel's evisceration of it for more detail.

40:31.740 --> 40:35.740
But for any and all faults of Clear Dynamics as Turchin has created it,

40:35.740 --> 40:38.460
I can't help but see the appeal of his counter-argument here.

40:39.100 --> 40:43.660
Namely, that the complexity of society does not make maths a poor analysis tool.

40:43.660 --> 40:46.220
Rather, it makes it the perfect analysis tool.

40:47.180 --> 40:50.540
How did we predict the weather before maths? Cows and frogs mostly.

40:51.260 --> 40:55.500
Empirical forecasts were mocked when they were invented, yet today we can't do without them,

40:55.500 --> 40:59.820
even with chaos getting in the way. They do so much better than anything we had before.

41:00.620 --> 41:04.860
By phrasing problems like this in mathematical terms, we have been able to make complex systems

41:04.860 --> 41:11.100
palatable to our feeble and bias-ridden minds. But maybe it's all still too convoluted.

41:12.060 --> 41:15.180
In the conclusion to his talk on the reality of psycho-history,

41:15.180 --> 41:18.860
Dan Crissan states that he believes all the mathematical ingredients are there.

41:18.860 --> 41:24.700
We just need the recipe. What then if our big brains are simply too dumb to make that recipe?

41:25.340 --> 41:27.180
Is this all a lost cause regardless?

41:29.100 --> 41:33.660
Well, we aren't the only big brains on this planet anymore, are we?

41:34.860 --> 41:38.860
Actually, before we get to that, I'm going to interrupt with some stop-press. Sorry,

41:38.860 --> 41:42.380
it wouldn't fit anywhere else. As I was putting this final video together,

41:42.380 --> 41:47.020
the internet rediscovered a study which predicts the end of civilization in the 2040s.

41:47.100 --> 41:50.700
That study was a 2020 reassessment of a prediction from the 70s,

41:50.700 --> 41:53.900
which formed its conclusion with similar modelling approaches to cleodynamics.

41:54.540 --> 41:57.820
I suppose I can take this opportunity to emphasise that there are indeed many studies

41:57.820 --> 42:01.740
of this sort out there. Turchin's cleodynamics is just one of the more developed.

42:01.740 --> 42:04.620
According to the recent assessment, we've matched some of the more grim

42:04.620 --> 42:09.740
trajectories worryingly closely. Hence, you know, headlines claiming MIT predicts the end of the

42:09.740 --> 42:13.820
world. I haven't had time to look into this properly, but I do have two points to make.

42:14.460 --> 42:18.220
First, that these studies aren't immune to the problems of context and nuance that may hold

42:18.220 --> 42:23.500
back cleodynamics. Second, in my initial research, I found a few solid refutations of similar

42:23.500 --> 42:28.860
arguments also made in the 70s, such as forecasts of sudden population decline that decade due to

42:28.860 --> 42:33.820
mass starvation. As it turned out, new technologies improved the globe's agricultural output and

42:33.820 --> 42:39.260
stopped that happening, so technological chaos may in fact have saved us and could indeed save us again.

42:40.060 --> 42:42.460
But that's all I have to say on that. Back to the video.

42:44.460 --> 42:53.260
Consider Netflix.

42:54.860 --> 42:59.180
On opening Netflix, other streaming services are available. I'm greeted with a selection of

42:59.180 --> 43:03.420
films and TV shows that may be to my liking. It's in Netflix's interests that they're

43:03.420 --> 43:07.580
to my liking. If they get it wrong and show me stuff I don't like, I'll conclude the service

43:07.580 --> 43:12.780
has nothing of value and stop paying them. So Netflix needs to predict what films I will like.

43:13.820 --> 43:19.420
Humans have easy shorthands for decisions like this. We can identify genre, personnel, tone,

43:19.420 --> 43:23.580
and so on, and there's a strong chance that these will correlate with potential future favorites.

43:24.220 --> 43:27.980
But if you strip that information away, can you still make good predictions?

43:29.020 --> 43:34.540
This was the challenge Netflix posed in 2006. They ran a contest inviting people to improve

43:34.540 --> 43:39.980
their film recommendation algorithm based on nothing but an enormous set of user film ratings,

43:39.980 --> 43:44.940
over 2 million data points that each looked like this. Triples of user, film, and rating

43:44.940 --> 43:50.540
identifiers together with the date. The hammer you need for such a nail of a problem is machine

43:50.540 --> 43:55.820
learning. Using some complicated concepts I have no time to explain like higher dimensional graphs,

43:55.820 --> 43:59.580
gradient descent, and a whole bunch of linear algebra, machine learning is about designing

43:59.580 --> 44:04.540
computer algorithms that update their own inner workings. Feed them a massive amount of training

44:04.540 --> 44:08.140
data along with some way of telling them how good a job they did analyzing that data,

44:08.140 --> 44:12.860
and they will literally learn. With only a few years of work and petabytes of data,

44:12.860 --> 44:15.980
they can identify features it takes humans milliseconds to recognize.

44:17.020 --> 44:21.980
Ah, the concerning thing is that it's all a black box. The innards of the algorithm are known

44:21.980 --> 44:27.660
only to that algorithm. We provide the ingredients and eat the meal, but nobody knows the recipe.

44:28.620 --> 44:33.580
The most successful entries to Netflix's contest used machine learning or similar.

44:33.580 --> 44:37.660
They could correctly predict people's movie tastes with no understanding of those movies

44:37.660 --> 44:43.260
except other people's tastes. Like our usual top-down view, this bottom-up approach correctly

44:43.260 --> 44:49.020
classified recognizable features like genres without any human input. This proved a breakthrough

44:49.020 --> 44:54.140
in online content delivery. Nowadays, Netflix uses metrics like watch time, click rates,

44:54.140 --> 44:58.860
and other numerical viewing patterns to recommend content. Everything run by machines to deal with

44:58.860 --> 45:04.140
the enormous data load. But what's truly spooky and of use to us in this video is that these

45:04.140 --> 45:09.020
algorithms can identify features we don't recognize. Groupings of films that have no

45:09.020 --> 45:14.220
obvious connection yet have reliable predictive power. If I like one, I'll like the other.

45:14.220 --> 45:16.940
Even if, as far as we can tell, they're wildly different.

45:17.580 --> 45:21.420
The YouTube algorithm does something similar, which is why my analytics tell me I owe half

45:21.420 --> 45:25.100
the success of my channel to this one completely unrelated video by Luke Correa.

45:25.980 --> 45:29.660
On that note, don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe because the YouTube algorithm is

45:29.660 --> 45:34.700
a fickle mistress. Machine learning has already transformed the internet and how we experience

45:34.700 --> 45:39.100
it. It's certainly responsible for my YouTube success, the most important part,

45:39.100 --> 45:44.700
so I feel confident in saying that. So, can we harness this AI powerhouse to predict more than

45:44.700 --> 45:54.780
just videos? Can it predict everything? This is GDELT, the global database of events, language,

45:54.780 --> 46:00.620
and tone. Founded in 2013, the GDELT project aims to collect and analyze vast amounts of

46:00.620 --> 46:06.620
digital data pouring out from humanity. Its archives go back to 1979, but since 2013,

46:06.620 --> 46:11.580
it's been collecting data every single day. Today, you can access the GDELT dataset on the

46:11.580 --> 46:17.580
Google Cloud platform. The vision of its creator, Kalev Litaru, is forecasting the future based on

46:17.580 --> 46:22.860
patterns and connections identified on a grand scale. He claims, for example, that his data

46:22.940 --> 46:29.100
predicted the Arab Spring. After it had happened, but still, GDELT uses emerging techniques to

46:29.100 --> 46:34.220
translate news articles, social media posts, and photos into quantitative measures of events and

46:34.220 --> 46:39.500
our emotions about those events. It then hits all that with the big machine learning hammer to extract

46:39.500 --> 46:46.300
unseen insights and, just maybe, predict the future. It's a faintly terrifying thought.

46:46.300 --> 46:50.700
Everything we broadcast here on the internet will find its way to an enormous computer brain that

46:50.700 --> 46:56.140
may or may not know what we're about to do before we do it. GDELT isn't the only attempt to

46:56.140 --> 47:01.580
outsource societal prediction to the machines. There's Project Cassandra, run by a German team

47:01.580 --> 47:06.540
aiming to predict the future using novels. There's Guard, the Alan Turing Institute's contribution

47:06.540 --> 47:12.060
to military prediction in Britain. And in the US, there's the disturbingly named Global Information

47:12.060 --> 47:16.780
Dominance Experiment spearheaded by the Pentagon. And these are just the ones we know about.

47:17.420 --> 47:21.900
Really, with these projects and many others like them out there, we might as well be under AI

47:21.900 --> 47:25.980
governance already. The machines took control and we didn't even notice.

47:29.420 --> 47:32.300
This was not a development that escaped Isaac Asimov.

47:33.980 --> 47:38.300
The final two books of the Foundation series, Foundation's Edge and Foundation in Earth,

47:38.300 --> 47:43.100
take place hundreds of years after Second Foundation. In the latter, the characters make

47:43.100 --> 47:48.380
a startling discovery about the origins of psycho-history. On the moon of an abandoned and

47:48.380 --> 47:53.820
highly irradiated planet once called Earth, they find an ancient robot named Ar Daniel Olivore.

47:54.460 --> 47:59.180
Olivore reveals he's been manipulating humanity for millennia and that it was he who put the idea

47:59.180 --> 48:04.620
for psycho-history in Seldon's head in the first place. While it somewhat undermines the premise

48:04.620 --> 48:09.420
of the entire Foundation series, this does show Asimov new robots would take well to societal

48:09.420 --> 48:15.020
prediction. At the time he joined the Foundation series, Olivore was already a well-worn character.

48:15.660 --> 48:19.660
He appeared in several Asimov stories and is representative of Asimov's attempts

48:19.660 --> 48:23.260
in his later years to bring his works together into a single shared universe.

48:24.140 --> 48:27.980
iRobot in particular therefore takes place in the same continuity as Foundation,

48:27.980 --> 48:31.740
and the last story in that collection reveals similar thoughts on society-level AI

48:31.740 --> 48:37.020
much earlier in Asimov's work. It tells of how supercomputers proved so adept at running the

48:37.020 --> 48:41.820
world's economy that humans put them in charge, ushering in a new age of global utopia.

48:46.140 --> 48:51.020
Unfortunately it's not the 1950s anymore. For good or bad, it looks like planet-level

48:51.020 --> 48:56.300
prediction at the hands of AI is inevitable. And with enough data and computing power,

48:56.300 --> 49:01.340
surely the sky's the limit. We could find hidden connections impossible to see without AI everywhere.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.700
We could truly predict everything.

49:05.420 --> 49:11.420
Well, video's over people. The question has been answered. We are indeed predictable.

49:12.620 --> 49:14.060
Pack it up, we're done here.

49:18.380 --> 49:23.340
In June last year, some guy called Denny tweeted about a machine learning algorithm he'd designed

49:23.340 --> 49:29.420
for depixelating low-resolution faces. The program produced a fake but realistic human face that,

49:29.420 --> 49:32.060
when downscaled, would recover the original image.

49:32.300 --> 49:35.660
People on Twitter, ever the experimental bunch, had a bit of fun with it.

49:35.660 --> 49:41.100
Here's the doom guy, for instance, now a real boy. Not half as cursed as the laughing emojis

49:41.100 --> 49:47.660
true form, though. And of course, we all know who this is, right? I mean, even a child could tell you.

49:48.860 --> 49:50.860
Who's that Pokemon?

49:53.340 --> 49:57.100
Oh. Oh no.

49:57.180 --> 50:05.260
Oh no. Yeah, the algorithm kind of changed Barack Obama's entire racial profile? Every time?

50:06.380 --> 50:11.660
It isn't unique to Obama. Feed in anyone who isn't obviously white and you getâ€¦ well,

50:11.660 --> 50:16.060
you get a white person. The accuracy of machine learning depends on the quality of its training

50:16.060 --> 50:21.900
data. In this case, the dataset likely had inherent bias. The algorithm had not seen enough

50:21.900 --> 50:26.620
diverse faces to identify them. And if you think this problem is limited to funny missteps on

50:26.620 --> 50:31.420
the internet, consider the case of Robert Julian Borchuk Williams. He was arrested for a crime

50:31.420 --> 50:35.100
he didn't commit because a facial recognition algorithm couldn't tell the difference between

50:35.100 --> 50:40.860
him and another black man. This is far from the only case of machine learning getting it wrong.

50:40.860 --> 50:45.580
How about the turtle made out of pictures of guns that Google's AI thought was itself a gun?

50:46.140 --> 50:50.860
Or the US military's tank detection AI that actually detected the weather? All the photos

50:50.860 --> 50:55.340
of tanks that had been fed were taken on a sunny day and, because no one knew it's inner workings,

50:55.340 --> 51:00.220
nobody noticed that it was picking up on the wrong thing. Even Netflix's algorithm famously

51:00.220 --> 51:05.180
tripped up trying to classify Napoleon Dynamite. The film was so polarizing that its rating pattern

51:05.180 --> 51:09.980
didn't look like that of any other film in the database. But aren't all these problems simply

51:09.980 --> 51:15.500
a question of gathering more training data? Kind of, but there's a more fundamental problem at play.

51:16.300 --> 51:21.420
The no-free lunch theorem is a mathematical result that, essentially, states that there is no

51:21.420 --> 51:27.180
universal learning algorithm that can predict outcomes accurately in every scenario. No matter

51:27.180 --> 51:31.820
its training data, it will always be possible to cook up something to foil the machine. That

51:31.820 --> 51:35.980
something may be weird and pathological, but finding it out there in the real world is always

51:35.980 --> 51:43.020
a possibility. We have mathematical proof of it. So even if you solved the bias and diversity issues

51:43.020 --> 51:47.420
plaguing the AI industry, which is an enormous task in itself, you're out of luck in your hopes

51:47.420 --> 51:52.860
to build an infallible automated prognosticator. Sure, you can build a good one, but we don't yet

51:52.860 --> 51:59.820
know how good. Perhaps the utopia of AI running the world for us is, in fact, impossible.

52:00.620 --> 52:20.620
So, after all that, after attacking every angle through a multitude of perspectives,

52:21.180 --> 52:25.660
we are now ready to answer the question. Are we predictable?

52:25.660 --> 52:29.660
Probably not.

52:31.660 --> 52:35.580
Look, I'm not qualified to tell you what to think here, which begs the question of why

52:35.580 --> 52:39.340
I'm making a video about this in the first place. But in my opinion, from all the evidence we've

52:39.340 --> 52:44.780
looked at, I don't think psychohistory is possible. For all I've praised mathematics,

52:44.780 --> 52:49.740
it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Models require assumptions, and we're often terrible at phrasing

52:49.740 --> 52:54.060
them. Whether they're assumptions about continuity or datasets being representative,

52:54.060 --> 52:58.460
they can cause problems. And when we're dealing with the grandest scale there is,

52:58.460 --> 53:02.700
we have to make lots of assumptions. Chaos has the power to prey on them,

53:02.700 --> 53:08.060
to render predictions about complex systems moot. It can't kill every model, but we don't yet know

53:08.060 --> 53:13.340
where history itself lies on this spectrum. And while I like the philosophy of clear dynamics,

53:13.340 --> 53:17.900
using maths to break through these complex systems, in its current form it can be

53:17.900 --> 53:22.940
sketchy in places. And even its creator believes chaos will inevitably rip it apart.

53:24.300 --> 53:29.580
With all we've looked at, we've made progress. But psychohistory as Asimov imagined it appears,

53:29.580 --> 53:34.220
to me at least, forever too distant. You might have come to a different conclusion,

53:34.220 --> 53:39.180
and that's fine. As I said, take everything I say with a big pinch of salt. I welcome

53:39.180 --> 53:44.860
differing opinions in the comments. But since I don't want to end this video on that anti-climax,

53:44.940 --> 53:47.580
I'm going to devote this last section to something different.

53:48.220 --> 53:54.140
Because foundation isn't solely a mathematical theory. It's also, and hear me out on this,

53:54.860 --> 54:01.100
a book. We may or may not be predictable. But what about our fiction? What can foundation

54:01.100 --> 54:08.060
tell us about that? Fiction is full of structure. We like to think it's an unrestricted outpouring

54:08.060 --> 54:13.260
of creative invention, but in reality it has plenty of rules, both explicit and implicit.

54:13.820 --> 54:17.260
In the most extreme examples, you have things like La Dispassion,

54:17.260 --> 54:21.820
where Georges Perrec goes the entire book without a single letter E. But outside of

54:21.820 --> 54:26.300
novelties like this, we're still drawn to particular formats. Theories like The Hero's

54:26.300 --> 54:30.540
Journey save the cat and even Dan Harmon's story circle, try to figure out what these are,

54:30.540 --> 54:35.260
and have had tremendous influence on media. At the lower level, you can't even tell a joke

54:35.260 --> 54:39.820
without invoking some sort of predictable structure. We know Paul the Leverkronk must be

54:39.980 --> 54:44.780
followed by Wrong Lever, because it and similar jokes have conditioned us to expect it,

54:44.780 --> 54:50.300
and that's often what makes it funny. I even rely on predictable formats for these video essays,

54:50.300 --> 54:55.260
because they give easy shortcuts for clarity, rhythm and comedy. A good drinking game to play

54:55.260 --> 54:58.940
with them would be to drink every time I use the rule of three, for instance, or a long,

54:58.940 --> 55:02.780
stoic paragraph with a short, stupid quip at the end. Or this music.

55:03.260 --> 55:08.780
I'm contractually obliged to use that in every video essay.

55:08.780 --> 55:12.140
And although lol's so randomness can also work for humour,

55:12.140 --> 55:14.940
it's not usually an effective way to write a whole story.

55:15.660 --> 55:20.380
For example, if a story doesn't give a satisfying payoff at the very end, people don't tend to

55:20.380 --> 55:25.260
like it. We can therefore predict that there will be a satisfying payoff, or at least an attempt at

55:25.260 --> 55:30.060
one. Neither will audiences take kindly to coincidences, although these can work if handled

55:30.700 --> 55:34.540
well. But if unpredictable and convenient events keep appearing, it feels cheap.

55:34.540 --> 55:39.100
This is, however, reserved for fiction only, and as evidence I present Dave Gorman's Google

55:39.100 --> 55:44.300
Wacadventure, the greatest exploration of coincidence ever put to film. And on that note,

55:44.300 --> 55:48.860
Googling prediction in fiction shows you a load of children's activities meant to teach them

55:48.860 --> 55:53.180
what to expect in a story. From a young age, we're all aware of how it should work.

55:54.140 --> 55:58.860
But blindly sticking to such rules everywhere is one surefire way to make something horrendously

55:58.860 --> 56:03.820
boring and of no artistic value to anyone ever. There are predictable aspects to fiction,

56:03.820 --> 56:09.180
but to survive, it has to embrace unpredictability as well. It's a constant tug-of-war between

56:09.180 --> 56:15.100
meeting expectations and, yes, subverting expectations. It's a bit like music. On one

56:15.100 --> 56:19.820
extreme, you have repetitive monocodal corporate elevator music, and on the other you have Arnold

56:19.820 --> 56:31.100
Schoenberg. Most people can't stand either. They arguably prefer a happy medium where the

56:31.100 --> 56:36.300
flow feels natural, yet unexpected at the same time. One where each moment teeters on the edge

56:36.300 --> 56:42.060
of our expectations, sometimes meeting them, sometimes not. You can't have a story go exactly

56:42.060 --> 56:47.340
to a preordained plan, just as much as you can't keep throwing random fluff around. Most of the

56:47.340 --> 56:52.540
time, storytelling lives in this limbo between narratives recycled and narratives invented,

56:52.540 --> 56:58.940
and Foundation exemplifies this more than anything. Foundation is a story about history that recycles

56:58.940 --> 57:05.820
history itself, but even today its structure seems odd. It's not a gripping yarn of human

57:05.820 --> 57:10.300
drama and the arcs of individuals, separating it from most of the fiction we recognize,

57:10.300 --> 57:15.020
and that does make it a difficult read for some people. No great heroes to root for or

57:15.020 --> 57:21.020
villains to hate. No deep or emotional examinations of characters' psyches. Just the march of history.

57:21.900 --> 57:28.300
The approach is certainly unconventional in fiction. How, then, can one possibly go about

57:28.300 --> 57:34.300
adapting such a thing for television? Yes, the elephant can come out from hiding in the corner.

57:35.260 --> 57:40.300
I've heard and read many opinions on the TV show, but to talk about it I decided I should at least

57:40.300 --> 57:45.740
watch some of it myself. Yes, I subscribed to Apple TV just to make this video. Let's

57:45.740 --> 57:51.180
hope my ad revenue can cover that. I don't envy the creators. Merging as a mob's giant but

57:51.180 --> 57:56.540
rather sterile vision with the intimate personal drama expected of TV shows sounds painful.

57:57.340 --> 58:05.500
Unfortunately for my money it all came out a bitâ€¦ meh. I mean, space elevator. Big yes.

58:05.500 --> 58:10.060
Less homogenous characters. Big yes. Straining to live up to its own mega historical aims

58:10.060 --> 58:13.740
when so much of it hinges on the generally uninteresting private lives of a few characters.

58:14.940 --> 58:19.740
Not so much. I wouldn't fault anyone for liking it, but I do agree with criticisms

58:19.740 --> 58:23.580
that the essence of Foundation turned mildly mushy somewhere along the way.

58:24.700 --> 58:28.700
Could this have been predicted? Was there any sign that we should have seen this coming?

58:29.420 --> 58:35.020
If ever there were a company that was hoping to sort of better people's lives through technology,

58:35.020 --> 58:39.740
through connectivity, it's Apple, and that's something very much that Asimov was hoping to do.

58:41.340 --> 58:46.700
Truly a mystery of the universe. Nah, but really this was probably inevitable,

58:46.700 --> 58:51.100
and Asimov's as much to blame as anyone. A century-hopping thought piece on the

58:51.100 --> 58:56.060
maths of history is a hard story to tell in any medium. We're too wedded to predictable

58:56.060 --> 59:01.020
structures of fiction for it to be easy. But we're also too wedded to the volatility of

59:01.020 --> 59:05.900
fiction to accept a story that predicts its own cause. So how does Foundation avoid that?

59:07.580 --> 59:12.140
This isn't a hollow question. John Campbell asked the same one after Asimov's first few

59:12.140 --> 59:17.260
Foundation stories, fearing the premise was getting stale. He ordered Asimov to disrupt

59:17.260 --> 59:22.620
the seldom plan, and Asimov gave him the mule. Asimov eventually grew to view Foundation as

59:22.620 --> 59:27.980
another writing challenge, attacking the premise from all sides. Given a plan based on iron laws

59:27.980 --> 59:34.460
of history, how could it still go wrong? What holes would go unnoticed? And this is really the

59:34.460 --> 59:40.380
value of science fiction. It explores questions science can't yet answer, but one day might have

59:40.380 --> 59:46.460
to. Fiction gives us incredible power to speculate and wonder, and Asimov more than most knew how

59:46.460 --> 59:51.500
to wield it. Foundation stands as a towering achievement in appreciating both the maths of

59:51.500 --> 59:56.060
history and, through the many who were inspired by the story it tells, the myth of history too.

59:56.620 --> 01:00:01.180
If historians' responses to cleodynamics have taught me anything, it's that we're at our best

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:06.940
when we strive to understand them together. Mathematics is a tool more powerful than any other,

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:11.580
but if we don't appreciate the human context when applying it, it won't get us anywhere.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:21.740
Personally, I'm content to believe that both our lives and our fiction remain unpredictable,

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:25.900
because that way, we never know what wonders lie in store for us in the future.

01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:37.260
Ah, Jesus, why? Was that even funny? Well, this is what's become of my attempts at

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:43.660
comedy now? Jesus Christ, it's not funny, it just hurts. Every time I try to make something new

01:00:43.660 --> 01:00:48.540
and original and I just revert to the same tired formulas over and over again.

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:55.820
Hmm, well, I am putting my foot down. This video will not be derailed like all the others,

01:00:55.820 --> 01:01:00.700
you hear me? I will break the eternal and depressive mould. No more of this format.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:04.700
No longer will we cower in fear of sudden, non-secretarial disaster.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.740
I forgot about a cannonball.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.660
Hey, so does anyone remember when you didn't know what this video was about?

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:20.940
Ah, those were the days. I said that someone had guessed the topic correctly in my 10,000

01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:25.820
subscribers Q&A and turned it into something intensely meta, and I had a lot of fun with that.

01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:31.660
Everyone at my Discord thought it would be Leviathan. I've never read Leviathan. Sorry.

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:36.540
But yeah, Discord, I have one. Joined for updates on and discussions about my videos,

01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:38.860
along with many other things. See you there.

01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:47.660
Thank you very much for watching, everybody. This video began as a love letter to Foundation

01:01:47.660 --> 01:01:51.260
and seems to have ended as a love letter to maths, which sounds good to me.

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:56.620
Either way, that was a lot of work. You can find all my research sources in the description,

01:01:56.620 --> 01:02:01.180
and I have to give particular credit to Marcus DeSotois, as I may have cribbed a disproportionate

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:06.380
amount of the maths in this video from his books and TV programs. Anyway, hope you enjoyed this

01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:11.580
video and learned something from it. Stay tuned for whatever comes next. Maybe now you'll know

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.860
how to predict it. Goodbye.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:45.980
Is an apple orchard in the imperial gardens that's older than the robot wars?
