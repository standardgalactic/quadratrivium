0	11520	Hey, so does anyone remember Jurassic Park?
11520	14320	Jurassic Park is a film about many things.
14320	17520	Dinosaurs obviously quite a big one, but then it's also about the risks of unchecked
17520	22280	science, the value of fatherhood, paying your software engineers a representative salary
22280	28320	that so destroy everything you know and love, and, most harrowing of all, mathematics.
28320	34080	Elegantly summarizing the last half-century on the topic with its iconic line, life, uh,
34080	38720	finds a way, Jurassic Park introduced a blockbuster audience to the subfield of mathematics known
38720	40400	as chaos theory.
40400	45200	You know, the butterfly effect, small changes leading to large changes, ergo, dinosaur-themed
45200	46760	butt-goat splat.
46760	50920	But did it strike anyone else as odd how certain Dr. Malcolm was in his predictions about something
50920	54120	that he himself argued was unpredictable?
54120	57080	How did he actually know it wouldn't have turned out fine?
57080	58760	Where were the calculations?
58760	61880	Could it be that he couldn't predict anything after all?
61880	65560	I knew he wasn't a real mathematician, mathematicians don't have sex appeal.
65560	69360	In truth, there are some things we can predict with considerable precision.
69360	72240	We know how well a plane will fly before it even takes off.
72240	75200	We know where the planets will be millions of years into the future.
75200	79840	And we know Paul the Lever, Cronk, must inevitably be followed by...
79840	84600	Wrong Lever!
90600	92520	Why do I even have that Lever?
92520	96840	Anyway, hey, so does anyone remember Foundation?
99960	105120	Foundation is a book series written by acclaimed science fiction author Isaac Asimov.
105120	110160	Depending on how long it takes me to make this video, it will be, is, or was also a TV
110160	116280	series, created for Apple's new, current, or long-defunct streaming service, Apple TV.
116280	119080	Many view Foundation as Asimov's magnum opus.
119080	123320	Indeed, it beat Lord of the Rings to the Hugo Award for Best Ever Series.
123320	127880	An award Asimov himself believed was created specifically for Lord of the Rings to win.
127880	131760	Which is all the more amazing when you realise the central premise of the book is a mathematical
131760	132760	theory.
132760	139040	This time, though, it's less life finds a way, and more life doesn't.
139040	143760	Asimov imagined a field of study called psycho-history, which would plug the current state of a galactic
143760	147320	society into a model and predict its future.
147320	151280	Foundation explores the consequences of psycho-history across hundreds of years, the tantalising
151280	154920	prospect of society itself being predictable.
154920	158160	But would psycho-history actually hold up in the real world?
158160	161840	How do we square it with chaos theory in all those butterflies?
161840	165760	As someone who knows a fair bit about maths, and, incidentally, someone with exceptionally
165760	170800	low sex appeal, checkmate Spielberg, today I am on a mission to find out.
170800	174520	I've assembled some of the latest research into predicting human behaviour with maths,
174520	178280	along with the frightening reality of it that may already be happening, to understand where
178280	181360	we're heading in the field of understanding where we're heading, as well as to learn
181360	185200	what it takes to write fiction about prediction in the first place.
185200	190480	So I predict you are going to sit right there for the next 50-ish minutes and join me as
190480	207200	we ask, Foundation, are we predictable?
207200	212000	This video contains major spoilers for the Foundation book series, as well as minor spoilers
212000	232840	for the media currently on screen.
232840	239000	Few other names, nay, few other words, are so laden with science fiction mystique.
239000	243320	It almost sounds like a name from another planet, that of the planet being the Soviet
243320	244320	Union.
244320	248240	Well, not quite, it was the Soviet Union's weird teenage phase when I hadn't quite
248240	252840	decided what it wanted to be yet, but whatever you call it, it was where Isaac Asimov was
252840	254000	born.
254000	257920	And if you thought the where was unclear, don't get me started on the when.
257920	262440	Nobody, neither Asimov nor his own parents, knew the exact date.
262440	266640	The best they could do was arrange, so, without any better way to decide, Asimov chose his
266640	268340	birthday himself.
268340	272380	He went for the latest date possible, which, 25 years later, meant he was drafted into
272380	278100	World War II because he was only just inside the required age bracket.
278100	281580	Asimov's parents emigrated to the United States when he was three.
281580	286500	They opened a sweet shop selling, among other things, pulp sci-fi magazines.
286500	290140	No prizes for guessing where young Isaac found his influences.
290140	295100	Hell bent on writing sci-fi, at age 18, Asimov started submitting stories to John W. Campbell's
295100	297220	astounding science fiction.
297220	301020	His first few were rejected, but Campbell insisted that Asimov should continue submitting
301020	304860	to hone his craft, even agreeing to regular meetings together with the hope that one day
304860	306940	he'd write something successful.
306940	310820	I wish the employers who rejected me would do that, but it's not the 1930s anymore.
310820	316020	Asimov's first published story appeared in 1939, but it was 1941's Nightfall that
316020	317340	made his name.
317340	321500	The story of a planet that has but one night every few millennia, where everyone goes mad
321500	326820	because they don't know about stars, propelled him to sci-fi stardom.
326940	329620	And from there, the guy went a bit nuts.
329620	335220	Few authors in any genre have been so prolific, so inventive, and so influential.
335220	336900	Take iRobot.
336900	342060	Asimov found the robot subgenre a tired shadow, endlessly rehashing stories of creations turning
342060	346580	on creator that did little Mary Shelley's Frankenstein hadn't done a hundred years earlier.
346580	350060	He left it an ethically expansive world of new questions and possibilities that shape
350060	352780	our treatment of real AI to this day.
352780	356220	But then the film version came along and sent us all backwards again, soâ€¦
356220	357220	Eh.
357220	361460	iRobot exemplifies the emphasis Asimov puts on big ideas.
361460	366820	It's a series of disconnected short stories that dissect a single topic from many angles,
366820	370460	poking and prodding his three laws of robotics to find the holes still present in a system
370460	374020	that does prevent robot uprisings.
374020	378540	The last question, possibly my favourite short story of all time, is similar.
378540	382500	Humanity returns to one question over and over in otherwise disparate vignettes throughout
382500	386900	the future, and is a pretty giant question to put it mildly.
386900	388900	But we aren't answering that one today.
388900	392020	Still a big one, but not that big.
392020	396140	Even my hubris has limits.
396140	399940	In 1941, Asimov was working at the Philadelphia Dockyard.
399940	402660	He hadn't had much time for writing.
402660	406340	He needed something new to show John Campbell in their upcoming meeting, something to blow
406340	409740	him away, but what?
409740	412340	Although he wasn't writing, he had been reading.
412340	416500	Specifically, reading Edward Gibbons' history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire,
416500	420740	a six-volume epic charting the fall of Rome and the factors responsible.
420740	424820	This gave him an idea, and led to a meeting that must have gone something like,
424820	443420	Alright Isaac, we need a new idea for a killer sapphire story.
443420	448620	Nobody had properly attempted a galactic empire before, much less than a count of its destruction.
448620	452260	We have foundation to thank for the empire in Star Wars, for instance, at least that's
452260	453900	what Asimov believed.
453900	458780	And being a space opera to film more recently than the 1970s, the Foundation TV show takes
458780	462820	obvious influence from Star Wars in return, proving we're all living in a big cultural
462820	463820	oraborus.
463820	468460	But Asimov wanted to go further than simply transposing the fall of Rome into space.
468460	471900	Gibbons theories had struck a chord with his love of examining human progress at the grandest
471900	477340	scale, and he couldn't help but ask himself, what if the fall had been predicted?
477340	481420	If, according to Gibbons, there were such clear factors in hindsight, would it not be possible
481460	484380	for someone to notice them at the time?
484380	489540	Combining the idea with his love for all things technological, Asimov went beyond even that.
489540	492740	What if someone applied the scientific method to such an insight?
492740	497260	What if they were able to turn history into a robust predictive science?
497260	501800	He called it psychohistory, that branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions
501800	506860	of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli.
506860	509460	Psychohistory can't predict an individual's behaviour.
509460	511740	It studies dynamics in aggregate.
511740	515300	The more people involved, the more accurate it becomes.
515300	519300	Asimov likened it to physical systems like gases which we'll look at in more detail
519300	520300	later.
520300	525180	Discrete particles, humans, move in any which way they like, but the emergent flow of institutions
525180	528620	and incentive structures is highly predictable.
528620	533580	In universe, psychohistory is the invention of mathematician Harry Selden, who is very
533580	535700	much Asimov's self-insert.
535700	540780	He predicts the Galactic Empire will fall into chaos for 30,000 years, but creates a plan
540780	546060	to shorten that dark age to only 1,000 by establishing the Foundation, a new settlement
546060	547700	at the edge of the galaxy.
547700	552340	Initially, we're told the Foundation's task is to compile all knowledge into an encyclopedia
552340	558220	galactica, preserving it beyond the decline, but Selden's true plan was much more subtle.
558220	562340	He placed the Foundation in precisely the right spot to course correct the future evolution
562340	567140	of the galaxy, meeting a series of pivotal events known as Selden crises.
567140	571380	It would prevail against these crises not through the acts of great men or random chance, but
571380	576100	the inevitable march of social trends.
576100	580700	In 1942, Asimov published the first story set in the Foundation universe.
580700	586380	It and four others were later combined into the full-length novel Foundation in 1951.
586380	590740	Then came Foundation and Empire in 52 and Second Foundation in 53.
590820	594740	Asimov returned to the series much later, adding two sequels and two prequels in the
594740	599620	80s and 90s, thus completing the Foundation...septilogy?
599620	603660	I have the main trilogy in book form, and it might well be the most gorgeous-looking book
603660	604660	I own.
604660	609060	Oh, shiny.
609060	614140	Much like iRobot, the series challenges its premise from multiple angles across a long-disconnected
614140	615140	time span.
615140	617420	Here's a good example.
617420	621780	At one point in the second book, the Foundation has defeated every enemy except the remnants
621780	626820	of the Old Empire, still powerful enough to crush the Foundation's feeble military.
626820	628260	But they needn't worry.
628260	631180	The Empire is in a stalemate with itself.
631180	636100	In short, any general who conquers a Foundation would become a threat to the Emperor himself,
636100	638380	so the Emperor can't allow this to happen.
638380	642300	The Foundation therefore does nothing and...wins.
642300	646140	Asimov based this event on the real story of one Roman Emperor and his general, found
646140	648540	in decline and fall.
648540	651860	Writing a series like this must have been immensely challenging.
651860	657540	Its characters are fleeting and ineffectual, its focus sociological rather than psychological.
657540	661060	And that's not even touching on how one can create an entertaining story where everything
661060	662900	is preordained right from the beginning.
662900	668540	Sure, fiction is full of structure like character arcs, climaxes and resolutions and brick jokes.
668540	669540	What's a brick joke?
669540	673660	You know what, it's not important right now, we'll get to it later.
673660	676940	But canon structure built on mathematical prediction really work.
676940	681620	Well, I'll be diving into this in more detail in part 6, so pin that thought.
681620	687940	The effect of writing Foundation as such is that, well, it has some issues.
687940	692300	With a few notable exceptions, the characters have less dimension than a piece of string,
692300	695740	and the prose is brimming with more Technobabble than baby Apex Twin.
695740	700020	Admittedly, Asimov Technobabble is my kryptonite, so I'm good with it, but you shouldn't go
700020	703380	dashing out to read it if you have different sensibilities.
703380	705780	He's famous for his ideas, alright?
705780	709660	Those ideas did, however, make Foundation an enormous success.
709660	714460	Along with winning the Best ever series award, it cemented Asimov as THE great science fiction
714460	715620	writer.
715620	717540	Its impact is extensive.
717540	719740	Science fiction hasn't been the same since.
719740	724420	It shaped Dune, Star Wars, Hitchhiker, it was in the glovebox of Elon Musk's space
724420	726500	Tesla for crying out loud.
726500	731340	Further afield, Nobel Prize winner Paul Crouppen credits it with pushing him into economics.
731340	737180	The closest field to psycho-history you could find in the real world, but can we do better?
737180	745180	Let's get to the meat of this video and ask, is Asimov's psycho-history actually possible?
745180	750020	And for that, I'm afraid we need to use math.
762340	764220	Hot take.
764220	766220	Mathematics is in many things.
766220	770300	I hesitate to say everything because some smart ass in the comments is gonna ask, what
770300	776380	about the set of all things that aren't mathematics and cause some kind of paradox, but I digress.
776380	780780	Maybe I'm biased, but maths helps us understand so much and has opened so many doors for our
780780	784940	modern world that it might well be humankind's greatest ever invention.
784940	790300	Science is maths, engineering is maths, economics is maths, politics is maths, video games are
790620	795820	languages maths, if you squinted it, even music is maths, but you've all heard that one already.
795820	801260	We use maths in all its forms to understand the world, often with eerily good results.
801260	805980	For example, we began by describing real world shapes with real world geometry,
805980	811100	but with time, the maths dared us to imagine new geometries that didn't exist in our universe.
811100	815260	Then, out of nowhere, some guy called Albert used those imaginary geometries to build the
815260	818460	most accurate theory of physical motion we've ever known.
818460	822380	You might recognise him, and that's because his theory correctly predicted the weird position of
822380	825260	some stars during an eclipse and that shot him to stardom.
826940	828380	I didn't even plan that.
828380	832060	All in all, it's quite astonishing the power maths has to portray the real world.
832700	836380	Not that I know. I'm writing my master's dissertation on category theory.
839820	841180	Co-kill me now.
841180	845660	And with Einstein's eclipse example, we see maths is particularly well suited to the
845660	850460	field of prediction. Accurate observation and insightful theories mean we can forecast
850460	852700	planetary dynamics with stunning precision.
853420	857340	Take a look at Wikipedia's timeline of the far future, one of my favourite places on the
857340	862460	internet, and you'll see just how many astronomical events we're aware of billions of years in advance.
863180	867820	But before we can predict large things like planets and societies, we need to start small.
867820	869500	So, here's a familiar example.
870380	873820	Consider a cannon at ground level, pointing 45 degrees upwards,
873820	877420	which instantaneously accelerates a cannonball to 100 meters per second.
878140	881180	Factoring in air resistance, how far will the cannonball travel?
882380	886220	Thanks to the work of generations of mathematicians and physicists before us,
886220	887340	we don't even have to think.
887900	892380	We can simply plug these numbers into a big formula and know for certain where the ball will land.
893020	895740	Our prediction then aligns perfectly with reality.
896540	906780	Oh, there must have been a random gust of virtual wind or something.
906780	908620	Well, guess we won't be seeing that ball again.
908620	910300	No matter, let's try once more.
916860	920940	These same laws of physics are so effective, they tell us a building can withstand an
920940	923420	earthquake before a single brick has been laid.
923500	926300	Or how well a plane will fly without anything leaving the ground.
926860	929500	In more general terms, this is mathematical modelling.
930060	934060	Writing and solving equations to study real-world systems and predict their behaviour.
934860	938620	Psycho-history brings mathematical modelling to bear against humanity itself.
939180	940540	How would such a model work?
941420	944620	Asimov's main inspiration was the ideal gas law.
944620	947580	Gases are composed of trillions upon trillions of molecules,
947580	949980	all bashing into each other like a microscopic mosh pit.
950620	953740	Predicting each particle's behaviour is nigh on impossible,
953740	957340	but put enough together and the discontinuities are averaged out,
957340	961020	leaving only the overall movement of the gas in response to external pressures.
962220	965020	There's a video on YouTube where Professor Dan Crisan compares
965020	967740	psychohistory to heat transfer, a similar concept.
968300	971660	At the microscopic level, we have what's called a stochastic process.
972300	976780	Particles with more energy move faster and impart their energy to others through collisions,
976780	980460	but in a given region of this size, these collisions are effectively random.
981260	984300	Again though, zooming out reveals the emergent structure.
984300	986380	Heat flows from hot areas to cold.
987020	989980	At the macroscopic level then, there is a clear pattern in play.
990780	994700	Because there are so many particles, we can assume the system is continuous
994700	998780	and can write expressions known as differential equations to describe that pattern.
998780	1003020	The solution to such an equation, if it exists but that's a story for another time,
1003020	1005500	then describes all those dynamics much more simply.
1006780	1008620	But there is important nuance here.
1009180	1013740	The equations assume continuity, that there is no smallest unit of the material,
1013740	1014940	when in fact we know there is.
1015500	1019900	Again, in practical terms, the particles are so small that our approximation is fine,
1019900	1024220	but this does highlight how modellers must be aware of the assumptions inherent in their descriptions.
1024860	1028380	We assumed that the outside of the material remains at a known temperature,
1028380	1030860	that the material is of uniform density,
1030860	1035180	that the laws of physics wouldn't change halfway through via sudden vacuum decay of the universe,
1037100	1039180	psycho history may not be a law of physics,
1039900	1042460	but that can't stop the power of mathematical models.
1044460	1049020	The Prime Minister has announced the most drastic limits to our lives that the UK has
1049580	1051420	ever seen in living memory.
1051420	1054140	The NHS will be unable to handle it.
1054140	1056860	A decision based on scientific projections
1056860	1060860	for how many thousands the virus might kill in the coming months.
1060860	1065180	Created scenarios will what might happen to the key metric of hospital admissions
1065180	1068220	with three different assumptions on how quickly...
1068220	1071660	Over the past two years, I've gone through several periods of near obsession
1071660	1074300	following models of the Covid-19 pandemic,
1074300	1076300	to the point that my mood on a given day
1076300	1079660	would depend on how that day's Covid statistics affected their predictions.
1080300	1083100	Unhealthy? Yeah, absolutely.
1083100	1085580	I think at the darkest points I needed their assurance
1085580	1087660	that there would be light at the end of the tunnel,
1087660	1090060	but they weren't always predicting light, were they?
1090700	1093180	My point is that population dynamics models,
1093180	1095260	in this case for a virus population,
1095260	1097500	held enormous sway over our lives recently.
1098060	1099340	Their might is evident.
1100300	1103100	Biological models make similar assumptions to physical ones.
1103660	1106380	Ignore individuals, zoom out to approximate continuity.
1107100	1110380	But because biological processes are arguably more complex
1110380	1112380	and less controllable than physical ones,
1112380	1113580	we need more assumptions.
1114220	1117100	This is why pandemic models disagree so often.
1117100	1119020	The maths never gives wrong answers.
1119100	1120460	We just feed it the wrong questions.
1121660	1124300	Outside of pandemics, we've used biological modelling
1124300	1126620	to understand predator-prey interactions
1126620	1128860	and humanity's effects on ecosystems,
1128860	1130860	such as figuring out sustainable fishing rates.
1131420	1133500	We're even simulating evolution itself.
1134140	1137260	Mathematical biology has exploded over the last half century.
1137820	1141580	More and more, we're finding biological systems are well suited to modelling,
1141580	1145500	suggesting psycho-history isn't as far removed from reality as it first seems.
1146220	1148460	I think if Asimov were writing Foundation Today,
1148460	1151420	he'd base psycho-history more on this than the physical sciences.
1152140	1154540	And as evidence, I present Jurassic Park.
1155420	1158620	A few of you may be surprised to learn that the film is based on a book.
1159180	1163260	Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park goes much harder into the biological maths,
1163260	1165660	and is so far the only instance I've ever seen
1165660	1168540	of a normal distribution being a major fictional plot point.
1170220	1171260	Plot point.
1171260	1174540	But Crichton took a much dimmer view of prediction than Asimov.
1175180	1178300	His mathematician self-insert is Dr. Ian Malcolm.
1178780	1181180	And we all know what he would think of psycho-history, don't we?
1184140	1185660	That is one big pile of shit.
1197180	1198940	In this land of many mysteries,
1198940	1203100	it's a strange fact that the largest legends seem to collect around the smallest creatures.
1204300	1206940	One of these is a mousy little rodent called the Lemming.
1208540	1210540	Here's an actual living legend.
1210540	1214140	For it's set of this tiny animal that it commits mass suicide
1214140	1215900	by rushing into the sea in droves.
1221100	1225100	In 1958, Disney put out a film called White Wilderness,
1225100	1227740	a documentary of life at the poles.
1228620	1230860	These days, it's infamous for one scene.
1231580	1233740	Contrary to the narrator's insistence,
1233740	1237660	the Lemmings were not voluntarily jumping from the cliff in a mass suicide attempt.
1238460	1239180	They were pushed.
1239740	1241020	The whole thing was fabricated.
1242140	1245340	White Wilderness didn't invent the legend of suicidal Lemmings,
1245340	1247180	that was part of existing folklore.
1247180	1248780	But it did bring it to the masses.
1249500	1253260	Nowadays, the word Lemming is synonymous with stupidity, death wishes,
1253260	1256140	and a pretty good video game for the 1990s that,
1256140	1258140	unfortunately still perpetuates the myth.
1259660	1263820	The myth arose due to extraordinary volatility in Lemming populations.
1263820	1267740	One year, a plague, the next near extinction, with no clear pattern.
1268620	1272060	With admittedly a few documented cases of Lemmings accidentally
1272060	1274300	driving each other off cliffs during migration,
1274300	1276620	mass suicide appeared the only explanation.
1277660	1281420	Though we're still not certain, today we have a much better guess.
1281420	1283660	Thanks, once again, to mathematics.
1284780	1286860	This is the Logistic Growth Map.
1287660	1290540	It's one possible model we can use for animal populations.
1291180	1294620	The population in year n is represented by xn,
1294620	1298060	so the equation tells us how to update the population for next year.
1298060	1301580	i.e. calculate xn plus 1, based on what it was last year.
1302300	1305660	The term R here represents the basic growth rate,
1305660	1307740	a measure of how quickly individuals reproduce.
1309260	1311660	Given an initial population and a growth rate,
1311660	1314460	we can hit the population with this map over and over again
1314460	1315980	to see how it develops year on year.
1316620	1318220	Notice it doesn't grow forever,
1318220	1321260	as the 1-xn term represents pressure from the environment
1321260	1324460	for the population to decline, such as a limit on food or space.
1324860	1326940	You'll notice that for some values of R,
1326940	1329260	the population eventually reaches a steady state.
1329820	1332940	After some initial wobbling, it reaches a stable level,
1332940	1336300	neither growing nor shrinking, as upward and downward pressures are balanced.
1337260	1340300	For others, it might settle into a repeating pattern,
1340300	1343420	up one year, down the next, oscillating between two values.
1344460	1346220	We can plot this behaviour on a graph.
1346780	1349180	The horizontal axis is the value of R,
1349180	1352060	the vertical axis is the steady state we eventually reach.
1352700	1356060	For R less than 1, all populations decline to extinction.
1357340	1361660	For R between 1 and 3, all populations approach some steady non-zero value.
1362620	1365340	Beyond 3, populations oscillate between two values.
1365340	1369660	Extending further, we get oscillations between 4 values and so on.
1370220	1373660	But beyond about 3.57, something rather silly happens.
1374220	1376700	The population never approaches a steady value
1376700	1379660	and instead jumps around unpredictably forever.
1380540	1386140	And Dr. Ian Malcolm is licking his lips because we've just discovered chaos theory.
1387180	1389100	Although Jurassic Park might give you the impression
1389100	1392060	that chaos theory is for the cool kids who aren't doing serious maths,
1392060	1393900	it is in fact a real field of study.
1394460	1397020	I know because I took an exam in it last year.
1397020	1401020	In 1961, Edward Lorenz was running calculations for weather forecasting
1401020	1402940	on these newfangled things called computers.
1403820	1406700	His forecast stored data to six decimal places.
1407260	1409660	Lorenz wanted to run the same calculations again,
1409660	1413020	but to save time, entered the data to only three decimal places.
1413900	1416620	He was astonished to find the outcomes differed wildly.
1417180	1419500	Sun became storms, storms became sun.
1420140	1423900	Small changes in initial conditions made the entire system unpredictable.
1424860	1427420	Lorenz published his findings in a paper that asked,
1427420	1431660	does the flap of a butterfly swing in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas,
1431660	1434060	enshrining the butterfly effect in the world's mind?
1434300	1439500	It's also a great example of mathematicians making discoveries by being lazy.
1440140	1444460	Chaotic systems like weather exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.
1445020	1447580	Despite being fully deterministic, that is,
1447580	1451820	the future follows from the present by rigid laws, these systems appear random.
1452460	1455100	You can't predict them without perfect measurements,
1455100	1456940	which are effectively impossible to obtain.
1458060	1460140	The logistic map is one such system.
1460780	1463740	A growth rate beyond 3.57 produces chaos.
1464140	1466620	Your predictions add the mercy of how precisely you know
1466620	1469740	both the starting population and the reproduction rate,
1469740	1472860	off by even one individual and you might as well be rolling dice.
1473820	1476700	Here then, we find a potential solution to our lemming problem.
1477340	1480380	Lemmings, you see, reproduce very quickly.
1480940	1484460	The point is debated, but some estimates suggest their adjusted growth rate
1484460	1487900	exceeds the chaos threshold, though usually in other models,
1487900	1490620	I just used the logistic map as a simpler example.
1490700	1493980	According to Wikipedia, lemmings are some of the few vertebrates
1493980	1497660	which reproduce so quickly that their population fluctuations are chaotic.
1498460	1500700	Hmm, and there's even a source for this claim.
1501580	1502700	Fascinating.
1502700	1503740	Thanks, Peter Turchin.
1504380	1505740	Interesting name that.
1505740	1508220	If lemming populations follow a suitable model,
1508220	1510780	and if they do reproduce this quickly,
1510780	1514540	then it seems reasonable for chaos theory to hold the true explanation.
1515500	1517660	So if you take one thing from this video,
1517660	1521100	let it be that lemmings only exists because of insatiable libido.
1523740	1527500	Chaos theory may then be an insurmountable obstacle to psycho-history.
1528140	1530300	If we can't predict the weather beyond a few days,
1530300	1533580	what hope do we have to predict thousands of years of galactic society?
1534140	1535980	If a butterfly can cause a tornado,
1535980	1538300	why can't a single human change the course of history?
1539340	1541820	But don't go thinking we've outwitted Asimov here,
1541820	1544060	because Foundation asks the same question.
1545020	1548780	The second half of Foundation and Empire introduces one of my favourite villains
1548780	1549740	in all of literature.
1550380	1554380	A space warlord forging a new empire from the ruins of the old,
1554380	1556620	bringing countless star systems under his control
1556620	1559020	and sowing paralyzing fear in those still standing.
1559660	1562940	They call him The Mule, perhaps for his great strength.
1563900	1568460	Citizens of the Foundation guess his rise to power must be the latest Seldon crisis,
1568460	1570940	so they gather to listen to Seldon's hologram recording,
1570940	1574380	which will tell them why they're destined to win and that they can sit back and relax.
1575100	1579740	Everything goes a bit to pot when Seldon starts babbling about a non-existent civil war instead.
1580380	1580780	Whoops.
1581580	1583500	The Mule then conquers the entire Foundation.
1584540	1585020	Whoops.
1585660	1588940	We later learn the Mule's secret weapon is a genetic mutation,
1588940	1590860	giving him some form of mind control.
1591500	1595340	He can command others' emotions, manipulating them to build an empire for him.
1596220	1600060	We also learn he was an unassuming clown called Magnifico the whole time.
1600060	1604220	The protagonists only get to jump on him because one takes a genuine liking to him,
1604220	1606860	and the Mule lets his guard down because he can't bring himself to interfere
1606860	1609180	with the one piece of genuine affection anyone's ever felt for him
1609180	1611980	in his life of disgust and derision that drove him to conquer the entire galaxy
1611980	1613900	in a single-minded act of revenge for how it treated him.
1615180	1615980	Well done, Azimov.
1615980	1617420	You wrote a good character for once.
1617980	1621980	Even more so because the Mule is Foundation's avatar for chaos theory,
1621980	1624460	or at least the notion of it that existed in Azimov's time.
1625260	1629820	Seldon did not and could not predict a random change to one person's DNA.
1629820	1633420	That change nonetheless spiralled into a big old butterfly of an effect.
1634220	1638380	Some critics have noted there are other aspects of chaos inherent in psycho history,
1638380	1639500	such as technology.
1640060	1644220	If Seldon could predict the date and impact of a galaxy-altering invention,
1644220	1646460	he basically knew enough to invent it himself.
1647100	1650780	Look at steampower or the internet and their radical impacts on our lives, for instance.
1651340	1655660	Would someone living before the steam train have any hope of predicting modern social dynamics?
1656620	1658860	But all hope is not yet lost.
1658860	1663580	Because while chaos theory is a major hurdle, it's not always all it's cracked up to be.
1664300	1667820	Even though I can't tell you exactly what the weather will do two weeks from now,
1667820	1671500	I can reliably predict its average behaviour for quite a bit longer.
1672620	1675820	For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, we'll see cold temperatures for the next few
1675820	1678380	months before a gradual period of warming into the summer.
1678380	1681340	Here in the UK, most of that period will be grey and miserable.
1681340	1685420	There will be storms here or there, which may or may not be caused by colourful flying insects,
1685420	1688460	but overall they will have little impact on most weather patterns.
1689740	1693660	It's a bit like rolling dice. Each roll is chaotic, deterministic,
1693660	1699180	but subject to incalculable tiny variations, yet enough together will always follow known statistics.
1701260	1705580	Even one of the poster children for chaos theory, the Lorenza Tractor, features order
1705580	1711180	among the chaos. It's a picture of airflow under convection inside a box. While the parts of the
1711180	1716380	air particles vary wildly, they still remain on the two main swells. In other words,
1716380	1720460	the specific trajectories can't be predicted, but the overall movement can.
1721420	1726620	Again, we're talking about averages in the aggregate. One atom is highly unlikely to
1726620	1732300	change the directions of trillions upon trillions. That's not to say it's impossible though,
1732300	1737020	but only for some systems, and it's hard to tell whether a given real world phenomenon is one of
1737020	1743660	them. But Harry Selden knew it was still a possibility. He accounted for it. Despite the
1743660	1750220	mules won in a quadrillion paradigm shift, Selden still had the last laugh. To see how we need to
1750220	1756060	move beyond atoms and lemmings. After all, they may be predictable, but we humans are so much more
1756060	1772380	advanced. Right? Why don't we play a fun game of rock, paper, scissors? I'll count us in,
1772460	1782140	we'll throw our hands on go, and you let me know who won in the comments. Ready? Three, two, one, go.
1785660	1790860	On the face of it, rock, paper, scissors is a random game. The choices are equally powerful,
1790860	1796540	and there's no inherent reason to choose one over another. Much like dice, with many trials,
1796540	1801340	the results should average out. One third of you should have lost to me, one third should have won,
1801340	1806300	and one third should have drawn. If that's the case though, why are there rock, paper, scissors
1806300	1813020	world champions? Yes, those exist. It's possible to consistently beat the odds because, in the hands
1813020	1818540	of humans, the game isn't random at all. Skilled players pick up on patterns and ticks and second
1818540	1823900	guessing to exploit the flaws in their opponent's thought processes. It even worked with this video.
1823900	1828380	If you know my patterns, you know I can't resist the temptation to make a terrible visual joke and
1828380	1833900	would never throw Dwayne Johnson. On a more general level, our brains exhibit cognitive biases that
1833900	1838460	make us more predictable than we'd like to believe, but I spoke about these at length in my diplomacy
1838460	1843020	video so I'll say no more here. What we're interested in today is how we can cash in on
1843020	1847740	these thought patterns with maths. And, perhaps unsurprisingly by now, there's a lot of scope
1847740	1854300	here. Take, as a morbid example, crime. Unless they're taking specific steps to avoid it,
1854380	1859020	criminals tend to commit crimes with a geographic pattern. When they commit multiple crimes,
1859020	1864140	the pattern strengthens and we can use this to narrow down investigations. As one example,
1864140	1869180	they may not act too close to home to avoid arousing suspicion, but don't want to put too
1869180	1873900	much effort into travelling and hence have an upper limit on distance too. Put these into a
1873900	1879100	formula and you generate a probability distribution that suggests the best places to find your suspects
1879180	1884860	given their crime locations. This technique is called geographic profiling. On the rise for
1884860	1889580	the last few decades, it's helped catch a fair number of serial criminals. Some have even used
1889580	1895100	it to retroactively predict the home of Jack the Ripper. As another example, consider the flow of a
1895100	1901820	crowd. Studies of ant swarms and fish shoals reveal that our movement isn't so different. We run on
1901820	1906620	autopilots and there are simple rules behind our movement, so we can save mental energy for more
1906620	1911420	important things like checking our phones. We can use these rules to design safer or more efficient
1911420	1916380	buildings. My favourite example is that placing an obstacle in the middle of a large hall can
1916380	1921980	actually improve traffic flow as it hacks like a roundabout. See America? It's completely natural.
1923340	1927580	All this points to at least some capacity to predict human behaviour even at the level of
1927580	1932780	individuals, which brings us to Asimov's next addition to the Foundation Universe, the second
1932780	1939020	Foundation. In the third book of the main trilogy, we discover Selden established two foundations,
1939580	1945180	one a blunt acts of technology and military might, the other a secretive puppet master scalpel.
1945740	1949820	The second foundation was to develop psycho history beyond Selden's groundwork,
1949820	1953580	making it more resilient to the whims of individuals and perhaps predicting actions
1953580	1958380	at a more granular scale. To do this, they explored the science of the human mind,
1958380	1963020	the ways it can be read and controlled. Unfortunately for this analysis, it does this
1963020	1969100	by having its members all be telepathic. Bit of a cheat code there. When the mule threatens
1969100	1972940	the Selden plan, the second foundation comes out of hiding to correct the aberration.
1973580	1978460	By predicting and shifting the actions of single humans, the second foundation suggests a much
1978460	1985340	finer version of psycho history and one that is self-correcting. But also telepathy, so yeah.
1985900	1991740	Despite the highlighted cases, we're still pretty far off forecasting the future of individuals.
1992380	1996540	Even if our brains exhibit patterns, our lives around them still appear for the most part
1996540	2001180	too chaotic. Countless events every day shape our future in ways we may never know.
2002060	2006700	We're forced then to retrace our steps back to psycho history proper, the prediction of
2006700	2011820	larger incentive structures. With the mathematical tools we've developed, are we any closer to
2011820	2017020	improving on Paul Krugman's substitutes of economics? Can we sidestep chaos theory to
2017020	2022620	truly build a model for humanity? Well, this would be a pretty disappointing video if I hadn't found
2022620	2027740	something, so ladies, gentlemen and others, please, put your hands together for the actual
2027740	2036860	real-world manifestation of psycho history. Clio Dynamics. Alright, alright, I'll get to that,
2036860	2042700	just let me explain what it is first. Guess I gotta cross Clio Dynamics off my controversial
2042700	2051500	topics for a YouTube video bingo card. Coined in 2003, Clio Dynamics is the term for the field
2051500	2056140	of study that mathematicalizes history. By collecting quantitative historical data,
2056140	2061020	its aim is to use statistical and modelling techniques to find the laws that dictate societal
2061020	2066460	progress. Much of the work on Clio Dynamics has been spearheaded by one man, Professor
2066460	2072540	of Ecology, Anthropology and Mathematics at the University of Connecticut, Peter Turchin. Hold on.
2076620	2081260	And there's even a source for this claim. Fascinating. Thanks, Peter Turchin.
2082220	2088380	I swear I found these two things independently. Turchin's background is in Beatles. He cut
2088380	2091900	his teeth studying their population dynamics, which of course we know all about now,
2091980	2097420	and the dynamics of other species, like lemmings. And he does indeed suggest lemmings may be one
2097420	2102060	of the few creatures exhibiting chaotic fluctuations. He moved on from ecology after
2102060	2106380	deciding he knew everything there was to know about Beatles, now setting himself the loftier
2106380	2111900	goal of studying humans. He believes that history, like biology, is ripe for being turned into
2111900	2118140	mathematics, and founded the journal Clio Dynamics to begin the task. Turchin's notoriety rose in
2118140	2123420	2010 when he announced that his work suggested a coming age of unrest in America. He became
2123420	2128380	even more famous in 2020 because his 2010 prediction said that would be the year when things would
2128380	2136140	get serious. Hmm. In Turchin's words, history as a subject is good at explaining the past.
2136860	2142220	Too good, in fact, and he cites one historian who had collated 210 competing theories for the
2142220	2147660	fall of Rome, making it incredibly difficult to choose between them. In my video Analyzing
2147660	2151980	a Darkling Plane, I compared that book's portrayal of societal demise to the Bronze Age
2151980	2157260	collapse, and we see a similar thing there. Theories ranging from spearmen emerging from the ocean,
2157260	2162380	to earthquakes, to an overly complex society falling in on itself in a process historian
2162380	2167740	Eric Klein calls systems collapse. This last one has a certain whiff of psycho history, if you ask me.
2168460	2173580	Clio Dynamics takes such hypotheses, translates them into mathematical models, and tests them
2173580	2179100	against databases spanning thousands of years. The hope is to identify the most plausible theories,
2179100	2184380	and with them, the mathematical laws of history, much like we have laws of physics and, increasingly,
2184380	2190460	laws of biology. Whether Clio Dynamics is really about predicting the future or only has use explaining
2190460	2196860	past trends depends on where you look. Turchin sometimes says yes, but sometimes says no,
2196860	2201260	citing some of the issues we've gone through already, while journalists representing his work
2201260	2205820	side emphatically with yes. And while it lets you write clickbait headlines like
2205820	2211100	the next decade could be even worse, can you really blame them? Because Clio Dynamics has
2211100	2216460	borne fruit. Despite countless differences between cultures that could have chaos-style effects,
2216460	2222540	there are, according to Turchin, consistent trends. Secular cycles are one such trend.
2222540	2227660	Apparent rhythms in boom and bust across time, driven by processes like elite overproduction.
2228300	2233020	Here, Clio Dynamics models suggest collapses are often preceded by a common social shift.
2233660	2238060	Namely, the funneling of more people into elite positions than there are elite positions available.
2238780	2241980	The theory goes that these shunned elites become the revolutionaries.
2242620	2246700	Even if you claim not to be in the business of prediction, forming such a model leads you down
2246700	2251580	that path. And yes, Turchin concludes that we're heading for the next crash as we speak.
2252220	2256700	But he can't predict the spark. Only the accumulation of fuel it can ignite.
2257420	2263820	Spoken like a true psycho-historian. As it happens, Foundation was a formative influence on Turchin.
2263820	2267820	He surely sometimes believes he is making Seldon's dream a reality. But it's no
2267820	2272380	surprise the man who considered chaotic lemmings has some criticisms of Asimov's predictive
2272380	2278380	machinery. He says that chaos theory makes mules of all of us, wrecking any hope for true precision.
2279100	2282940	He also takes issue with Seldon's insistence that his plan should remain a mystery.
2283900	2288060	Asimov spends most of Second Foundation arguing that knowing psycho-history's
2288060	2293020	prophecies ahead of time renders them useless. After coming out of hiding to defeat the mule,
2293020	2298140	the Second Foundation must convince the galaxy it has itself been crushed, lest the Seldon plan go
2298140	2304220	awry. In real life, this is called the uncertainty principle of the social sciences. Even with chaos
2304220	2308540	in the mix, forecasting the weather won't change the weather. Make a prediction in economics,
2308540	2313020	though, and you might bring about the crash you sought to prevent. Simplified to the point of
2313020	2317820	irritating economists, that's all the field is. Things having value because they're forecast to
2317820	2322860	have value. Game stop notwithstanding. But Turchin says clear dynamics can survive this,
2322860	2325900	because who cares about one odd professor's thoughts on the future?
2327020	2332780	The trouble is, quite a few people do. Right, you can bring back your pitchforks now.
2334700	2338140	Historians have not taken kindly to a mathematician coming along to tell them
2338140	2342300	they're all studying history wrong. And, weirdly, neither have the mathematicians.
2342300	2346300	Now, I'm not qualified to say either way, but I've seen enough claims that
2346300	2351420	Turchin's methodology is questionable to give them some weight. He's been accused of cherry
2351420	2355660	picking data to suit his conclusions, for instance, and prophesising historical trends to
2355660	2361580	shape policy recommendations has drawn someâ€¦ unwelcome comparisons. Plus, you can't ignore
2361580	2367980	the survivorship bias. I can make a prediction that the world will end on the 9th of January
2368220	2373900	2031, and I'll join the long list of very wrong doomsday profits throughout history.
2374780	2379820	I hope. Turchin divined 2020, but we don't care about everyone who said 2019, do we?
2380380	2384860	But far and away the most common critique is that reducing history to numbers removes all
2384860	2389180	the nuance and context that's necessary to understand it at all. It's similar to the
2389180	2393900	criticism leveled against creators of so-called mega-histories, accounts of the big picture
2393900	2398060	which eschew the details in favour of high-level patterns. I need only mention guns,
2398060	2402940	germs, and steel to be marked anti-history for life. In general, historians believe that
2402940	2407900	society is simply too complex to predict. There are so many theories for the fall of Rome or
2407900	2411980	the Bronze Age collapse because there are so many things that can affect it. Sure,
2411980	2416300	we can plot a few of them on time series graphs, but none of them can ever come close to the full
2416300	2421260	picture. I'm reminded here of the notorious study on the decline of modern music from a few
2421260	2427180	years ago. It measured a few ill-chosen datasets without necessary context and called it a day.
2427180	2430780	I direct you towards YouTuber Tantacruel's evisceration of it for more detail.
2431740	2435740	But for any and all faults of Clear Dynamics as Turchin has created it,
2435740	2438460	I can't help but see the appeal of his counter-argument here.
2439100	2443660	Namely, that the complexity of society does not make maths a poor analysis tool.
2443660	2446220	Rather, it makes it the perfect analysis tool.
2447180	2450540	How did we predict the weather before maths? Cows and frogs mostly.
2451260	2455500	Empirical forecasts were mocked when they were invented, yet today we can't do without them,
2455500	2459820	even with chaos getting in the way. They do so much better than anything we had before.
2460620	2464860	By phrasing problems like this in mathematical terms, we have been able to make complex systems
2464860	2471100	palatable to our feeble and bias-ridden minds. But maybe it's all still too convoluted.
2472060	2475180	In the conclusion to his talk on the reality of psycho-history,
2475180	2478860	Dan Crissan states that he believes all the mathematical ingredients are there.
2478860	2484700	We just need the recipe. What then if our big brains are simply too dumb to make that recipe?
2485340	2487180	Is this all a lost cause regardless?
2489100	2493660	Well, we aren't the only big brains on this planet anymore, are we?
2494860	2498860	Actually, before we get to that, I'm going to interrupt with some stop-press. Sorry,
2498860	2502380	it wouldn't fit anywhere else. As I was putting this final video together,
2502380	2507020	the internet rediscovered a study which predicts the end of civilization in the 2040s.
2507100	2510700	That study was a 2020 reassessment of a prediction from the 70s,
2510700	2513900	which formed its conclusion with similar modelling approaches to cleodynamics.
2514540	2517820	I suppose I can take this opportunity to emphasise that there are indeed many studies
2517820	2521740	of this sort out there. Turchin's cleodynamics is just one of the more developed.
2521740	2524620	According to the recent assessment, we've matched some of the more grim
2524620	2529740	trajectories worryingly closely. Hence, you know, headlines claiming MIT predicts the end of the
2529740	2533820	world. I haven't had time to look into this properly, but I do have two points to make.
2534460	2538220	First, that these studies aren't immune to the problems of context and nuance that may hold
2538220	2543500	back cleodynamics. Second, in my initial research, I found a few solid refutations of similar
2543500	2548860	arguments also made in the 70s, such as forecasts of sudden population decline that decade due to
2548860	2553820	mass starvation. As it turned out, new technologies improved the globe's agricultural output and
2553820	2559260	stopped that happening, so technological chaos may in fact have saved us and could indeed save us again.
2560060	2562460	But that's all I have to say on that. Back to the video.
2564460	2573260	Consider Netflix.
2574860	2579180	On opening Netflix, other streaming services are available. I'm greeted with a selection of
2579180	2583420	films and TV shows that may be to my liking. It's in Netflix's interests that they're
2583420	2587580	to my liking. If they get it wrong and show me stuff I don't like, I'll conclude the service
2587580	2592780	has nothing of value and stop paying them. So Netflix needs to predict what films I will like.
2593820	2599420	Humans have easy shorthands for decisions like this. We can identify genre, personnel, tone,
2599420	2603580	and so on, and there's a strong chance that these will correlate with potential future favorites.
2604220	2607980	But if you strip that information away, can you still make good predictions?
2609020	2614540	This was the challenge Netflix posed in 2006. They ran a contest inviting people to improve
2614540	2619980	their film recommendation algorithm based on nothing but an enormous set of user film ratings,
2619980	2624940	over 2 million data points that each looked like this. Triples of user, film, and rating
2624940	2630540	identifiers together with the date. The hammer you need for such a nail of a problem is machine
2630540	2635820	learning. Using some complicated concepts I have no time to explain like higher dimensional graphs,
2635820	2639580	gradient descent, and a whole bunch of linear algebra, machine learning is about designing
2639580	2644540	computer algorithms that update their own inner workings. Feed them a massive amount of training
2644540	2648140	data along with some way of telling them how good a job they did analyzing that data,
2648140	2652860	and they will literally learn. With only a few years of work and petabytes of data,
2652860	2655980	they can identify features it takes humans milliseconds to recognize.
2657020	2661980	Ah, the concerning thing is that it's all a black box. The innards of the algorithm are known
2661980	2667660	only to that algorithm. We provide the ingredients and eat the meal, but nobody knows the recipe.
2668620	2673580	The most successful entries to Netflix's contest used machine learning or similar.
2673580	2677660	They could correctly predict people's movie tastes with no understanding of those movies
2677660	2683260	except other people's tastes. Like our usual top-down view, this bottom-up approach correctly
2683260	2689020	classified recognizable features like genres without any human input. This proved a breakthrough
2689020	2694140	in online content delivery. Nowadays, Netflix uses metrics like watch time, click rates,
2694140	2698860	and other numerical viewing patterns to recommend content. Everything run by machines to deal with
2698860	2704140	the enormous data load. But what's truly spooky and of use to us in this video is that these
2704140	2709020	algorithms can identify features we don't recognize. Groupings of films that have no
2709020	2714220	obvious connection yet have reliable predictive power. If I like one, I'll like the other.
2714220	2716940	Even if, as far as we can tell, they're wildly different.
2717580	2721420	The YouTube algorithm does something similar, which is why my analytics tell me I owe half
2721420	2725100	the success of my channel to this one completely unrelated video by Luke Correa.
2725980	2729660	On that note, don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe because the YouTube algorithm is
2729660	2734700	a fickle mistress. Machine learning has already transformed the internet and how we experience
2734700	2739100	it. It's certainly responsible for my YouTube success, the most important part,
2739100	2744700	so I feel confident in saying that. So, can we harness this AI powerhouse to predict more than
2744700	2754780	just videos? Can it predict everything? This is GDELT, the global database of events, language,
2754780	2760620	and tone. Founded in 2013, the GDELT project aims to collect and analyze vast amounts of
2760620	2766620	digital data pouring out from humanity. Its archives go back to 1979, but since 2013,
2766620	2771580	it's been collecting data every single day. Today, you can access the GDELT dataset on the
2771580	2777580	Google Cloud platform. The vision of its creator, Kalev Litaru, is forecasting the future based on
2777580	2782860	patterns and connections identified on a grand scale. He claims, for example, that his data
2782940	2789100	predicted the Arab Spring. After it had happened, but still, GDELT uses emerging techniques to
2789100	2794220	translate news articles, social media posts, and photos into quantitative measures of events and
2794220	2799500	our emotions about those events. It then hits all that with the big machine learning hammer to extract
2799500	2806300	unseen insights and, just maybe, predict the future. It's a faintly terrifying thought.
2806300	2810700	Everything we broadcast here on the internet will find its way to an enormous computer brain that
2810700	2816140	may or may not know what we're about to do before we do it. GDELT isn't the only attempt to
2816140	2821580	outsource societal prediction to the machines. There's Project Cassandra, run by a German team
2821580	2826540	aiming to predict the future using novels. There's Guard, the Alan Turing Institute's contribution
2826540	2832060	to military prediction in Britain. And in the US, there's the disturbingly named Global Information
2832060	2836780	Dominance Experiment spearheaded by the Pentagon. And these are just the ones we know about.
2837420	2841900	Really, with these projects and many others like them out there, we might as well be under AI
2841900	2845980	governance already. The machines took control and we didn't even notice.
2849420	2852300	This was not a development that escaped Isaac Asimov.
2853980	2858300	The final two books of the Foundation series, Foundation's Edge and Foundation in Earth,
2858300	2863100	take place hundreds of years after Second Foundation. In the latter, the characters make
2863100	2868380	a startling discovery about the origins of psycho-history. On the moon of an abandoned and
2868380	2873820	highly irradiated planet once called Earth, they find an ancient robot named Ar Daniel Olivore.
2874460	2879180	Olivore reveals he's been manipulating humanity for millennia and that it was he who put the idea
2879180	2884620	for psycho-history in Seldon's head in the first place. While it somewhat undermines the premise
2884620	2889420	of the entire Foundation series, this does show Asimov new robots would take well to societal
2889420	2895020	prediction. At the time he joined the Foundation series, Olivore was already a well-worn character.
2895660	2899660	He appeared in several Asimov stories and is representative of Asimov's attempts
2899660	2903260	in his later years to bring his works together into a single shared universe.
2904140	2907980	iRobot in particular therefore takes place in the same continuity as Foundation,
2907980	2911740	and the last story in that collection reveals similar thoughts on society-level AI
2911740	2917020	much earlier in Asimov's work. It tells of how supercomputers proved so adept at running the
2917020	2921820	world's economy that humans put them in charge, ushering in a new age of global utopia.
2926140	2931020	Unfortunately it's not the 1950s anymore. For good or bad, it looks like planet-level
2931020	2936300	prediction at the hands of AI is inevitable. And with enough data and computing power,
2936300	2941340	surely the sky's the limit. We could find hidden connections impossible to see without AI everywhere.
2941900	2944700	We could truly predict everything.
2945420	2951420	Well, video's over people. The question has been answered. We are indeed predictable.
2952620	2954060	Pack it up, we're done here.
2958380	2963340	In June last year, some guy called Denny tweeted about a machine learning algorithm he'd designed
2963340	2969420	for depixelating low-resolution faces. The program produced a fake but realistic human face that,
2969420	2972060	when downscaled, would recover the original image.
2972300	2975660	People on Twitter, ever the experimental bunch, had a bit of fun with it.
2975660	2981100	Here's the doom guy, for instance, now a real boy. Not half as cursed as the laughing emojis
2981100	2987660	true form, though. And of course, we all know who this is, right? I mean, even a child could tell you.
2988860	2990860	Who's that Pokemon?
2993340	2997100	Oh. Oh no.
2997180	3005260	Oh no. Yeah, the algorithm kind of changed Barack Obama's entire racial profile? Every time?
3006380	3011660	It isn't unique to Obama. Feed in anyone who isn't obviously white and you getâ€¦ well,
3011660	3016060	you get a white person. The accuracy of machine learning depends on the quality of its training
3016060	3021900	data. In this case, the dataset likely had inherent bias. The algorithm had not seen enough
3021900	3026620	diverse faces to identify them. And if you think this problem is limited to funny missteps on
3026620	3031420	the internet, consider the case of Robert Julian Borchuk Williams. He was arrested for a crime
3031420	3035100	he didn't commit because a facial recognition algorithm couldn't tell the difference between
3035100	3040860	him and another black man. This is far from the only case of machine learning getting it wrong.
3040860	3045580	How about the turtle made out of pictures of guns that Google's AI thought was itself a gun?
3046140	3050860	Or the US military's tank detection AI that actually detected the weather? All the photos
3050860	3055340	of tanks that had been fed were taken on a sunny day and, because no one knew it's inner workings,
3055340	3060220	nobody noticed that it was picking up on the wrong thing. Even Netflix's algorithm famously
3060220	3065180	tripped up trying to classify Napoleon Dynamite. The film was so polarizing that its rating pattern
3065180	3069980	didn't look like that of any other film in the database. But aren't all these problems simply
3069980	3075500	a question of gathering more training data? Kind of, but there's a more fundamental problem at play.
3076300	3081420	The no-free lunch theorem is a mathematical result that, essentially, states that there is no
3081420	3087180	universal learning algorithm that can predict outcomes accurately in every scenario. No matter
3087180	3091820	its training data, it will always be possible to cook up something to foil the machine. That
3091820	3095980	something may be weird and pathological, but finding it out there in the real world is always
3095980	3103020	a possibility. We have mathematical proof of it. So even if you solved the bias and diversity issues
3103020	3107420	plaguing the AI industry, which is an enormous task in itself, you're out of luck in your hopes
3107420	3112860	to build an infallible automated prognosticator. Sure, you can build a good one, but we don't yet
3112860	3119820	know how good. Perhaps the utopia of AI running the world for us is, in fact, impossible.
3120620	3140620	So, after all that, after attacking every angle through a multitude of perspectives,
3141180	3145660	we are now ready to answer the question. Are we predictable?
3145660	3149660	Probably not.
3151660	3155580	Look, I'm not qualified to tell you what to think here, which begs the question of why
3155580	3159340	I'm making a video about this in the first place. But in my opinion, from all the evidence we've
3159340	3164780	looked at, I don't think psychohistory is possible. For all I've praised mathematics,
3164780	3169740	it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Models require assumptions, and we're often terrible at phrasing
3169740	3174060	them. Whether they're assumptions about continuity or datasets being representative,
3174060	3178460	they can cause problems. And when we're dealing with the grandest scale there is,
3178460	3182700	we have to make lots of assumptions. Chaos has the power to prey on them,
3182700	3188060	to render predictions about complex systems moot. It can't kill every model, but we don't yet know
3188060	3193340	where history itself lies on this spectrum. And while I like the philosophy of clear dynamics,
3193340	3197900	using maths to break through these complex systems, in its current form it can be
3197900	3202940	sketchy in places. And even its creator believes chaos will inevitably rip it apart.
3204300	3209580	With all we've looked at, we've made progress. But psychohistory as Asimov imagined it appears,
3209580	3214220	to me at least, forever too distant. You might have come to a different conclusion,
3214220	3219180	and that's fine. As I said, take everything I say with a big pinch of salt. I welcome
3219180	3224860	differing opinions in the comments. But since I don't want to end this video on that anti-climax,
3224940	3227580	I'm going to devote this last section to something different.
3228220	3234140	Because foundation isn't solely a mathematical theory. It's also, and hear me out on this,
3234860	3241100	a book. We may or may not be predictable. But what about our fiction? What can foundation
3241100	3248060	tell us about that? Fiction is full of structure. We like to think it's an unrestricted outpouring
3248060	3253260	of creative invention, but in reality it has plenty of rules, both explicit and implicit.
3253820	3257260	In the most extreme examples, you have things like La Dispassion,
3257260	3261820	where Georges Perrec goes the entire book without a single letter E. But outside of
3261820	3266300	novelties like this, we're still drawn to particular formats. Theories like The Hero's
3266300	3270540	Journey save the cat and even Dan Harmon's story circle, try to figure out what these are,
3270540	3275260	and have had tremendous influence on media. At the lower level, you can't even tell a joke
3275260	3279820	without invoking some sort of predictable structure. We know Paul the Leverkronk must be
3279980	3284780	followed by Wrong Lever, because it and similar jokes have conditioned us to expect it,
3284780	3290300	and that's often what makes it funny. I even rely on predictable formats for these video essays,
3290300	3295260	because they give easy shortcuts for clarity, rhythm and comedy. A good drinking game to play
3295260	3298940	with them would be to drink every time I use the rule of three, for instance, or a long,
3298940	3302780	stoic paragraph with a short, stupid quip at the end. Or this music.
3303260	3308780	I'm contractually obliged to use that in every video essay.
3308780	3312140	And although lol's so randomness can also work for humour,
3312140	3314940	it's not usually an effective way to write a whole story.
3315660	3320380	For example, if a story doesn't give a satisfying payoff at the very end, people don't tend to
3320380	3325260	like it. We can therefore predict that there will be a satisfying payoff, or at least an attempt at
3325260	3330060	one. Neither will audiences take kindly to coincidences, although these can work if handled
3330700	3334540	well. But if unpredictable and convenient events keep appearing, it feels cheap.
3334540	3339100	This is, however, reserved for fiction only, and as evidence I present Dave Gorman's Google
3339100	3344300	Wacadventure, the greatest exploration of coincidence ever put to film. And on that note,
3344300	3348860	Googling prediction in fiction shows you a load of children's activities meant to teach them
3348860	3353180	what to expect in a story. From a young age, we're all aware of how it should work.
3354140	3358860	But blindly sticking to such rules everywhere is one surefire way to make something horrendously
3358860	3363820	boring and of no artistic value to anyone ever. There are predictable aspects to fiction,
3363820	3369180	but to survive, it has to embrace unpredictability as well. It's a constant tug-of-war between
3369180	3375100	meeting expectations and, yes, subverting expectations. It's a bit like music. On one
3375100	3379820	extreme, you have repetitive monocodal corporate elevator music, and on the other you have Arnold
3379820	3391100	Schoenberg. Most people can't stand either. They arguably prefer a happy medium where the
3391100	3396300	flow feels natural, yet unexpected at the same time. One where each moment teeters on the edge
3396300	3402060	of our expectations, sometimes meeting them, sometimes not. You can't have a story go exactly
3402060	3407340	to a preordained plan, just as much as you can't keep throwing random fluff around. Most of the
3407340	3412540	time, storytelling lives in this limbo between narratives recycled and narratives invented,
3412540	3418940	and Foundation exemplifies this more than anything. Foundation is a story about history that recycles
3418940	3425820	history itself, but even today its structure seems odd. It's not a gripping yarn of human
3425820	3430300	drama and the arcs of individuals, separating it from most of the fiction we recognize,
3430300	3435020	and that does make it a difficult read for some people. No great heroes to root for or
3435020	3441020	villains to hate. No deep or emotional examinations of characters' psyches. Just the march of history.
3441900	3448300	The approach is certainly unconventional in fiction. How, then, can one possibly go about
3448300	3454300	adapting such a thing for television? Yes, the elephant can come out from hiding in the corner.
3455260	3460300	I've heard and read many opinions on the TV show, but to talk about it I decided I should at least
3460300	3465740	watch some of it myself. Yes, I subscribed to Apple TV just to make this video. Let's
3465740	3471180	hope my ad revenue can cover that. I don't envy the creators. Merging as a mob's giant but
3471180	3476540	rather sterile vision with the intimate personal drama expected of TV shows sounds painful.
3477340	3485500	Unfortunately for my money it all came out a bitâ€¦ meh. I mean, space elevator. Big yes.
3485500	3490060	Less homogenous characters. Big yes. Straining to live up to its own mega historical aims
3490060	3493740	when so much of it hinges on the generally uninteresting private lives of a few characters.
3494940	3499740	Not so much. I wouldn't fault anyone for liking it, but I do agree with criticisms
3499740	3503580	that the essence of Foundation turned mildly mushy somewhere along the way.
3504700	3508700	Could this have been predicted? Was there any sign that we should have seen this coming?
3509420	3515020	If ever there were a company that was hoping to sort of better people's lives through technology,
3515020	3519740	through connectivity, it's Apple, and that's something very much that Asimov was hoping to do.
3521340	3526700	Truly a mystery of the universe. Nah, but really this was probably inevitable,
3526700	3531100	and Asimov's as much to blame as anyone. A century-hopping thought piece on the
3531100	3536060	maths of history is a hard story to tell in any medium. We're too wedded to predictable
3536060	3541020	structures of fiction for it to be easy. But we're also too wedded to the volatility of
3541020	3545900	fiction to accept a story that predicts its own cause. So how does Foundation avoid that?
3547580	3552140	This isn't a hollow question. John Campbell asked the same one after Asimov's first few
3552140	3557260	Foundation stories, fearing the premise was getting stale. He ordered Asimov to disrupt
3557260	3562620	the seldom plan, and Asimov gave him the mule. Asimov eventually grew to view Foundation as
3562620	3567980	another writing challenge, attacking the premise from all sides. Given a plan based on iron laws
3567980	3574460	of history, how could it still go wrong? What holes would go unnoticed? And this is really the
3574460	3580380	value of science fiction. It explores questions science can't yet answer, but one day might have
3580380	3586460	to. Fiction gives us incredible power to speculate and wonder, and Asimov more than most knew how
3586460	3591500	to wield it. Foundation stands as a towering achievement in appreciating both the maths of
3591500	3596060	history and, through the many who were inspired by the story it tells, the myth of history too.
3596620	3601180	If historians' responses to cleodynamics have taught me anything, it's that we're at our best
3601180	3606940	when we strive to understand them together. Mathematics is a tool more powerful than any other,
3606940	3611580	but if we don't appreciate the human context when applying it, it won't get us anywhere.
3617020	3621740	Personally, I'm content to believe that both our lives and our fiction remain unpredictable,
3621820	3625900	because that way, we never know what wonders lie in store for us in the future.
3630380	3637260	Ah, Jesus, why? Was that even funny? Well, this is what's become of my attempts at
3637260	3643660	comedy now? Jesus Christ, it's not funny, it just hurts. Every time I try to make something new
3643660	3648540	and original and I just revert to the same tired formulas over and over again.
3649500	3655820	Hmm, well, I am putting my foot down. This video will not be derailed like all the others,
3655820	3660700	you hear me? I will break the eternal and depressive mould. No more of this format.
3660700	3664700	No longer will we cower in fear of sudden, non-secretarial disaster.
3668140	3669740	I forgot about a cannonball.
3672700	3675660	Hey, so does anyone remember when you didn't know what this video was about?
3676300	3680940	Ah, those were the days. I said that someone had guessed the topic correctly in my 10,000
3680940	3685820	subscribers Q&A and turned it into something intensely meta, and I had a lot of fun with that.
3686700	3691660	Everyone at my Discord thought it would be Leviathan. I've never read Leviathan. Sorry.
3692300	3696540	But yeah, Discord, I have one. Joined for updates on and discussions about my videos,
3696540	3698860	along with many other things. See you there.
3699500	3707660	Thank you very much for watching, everybody. This video began as a love letter to Foundation
3707660	3711260	and seems to have ended as a love letter to maths, which sounds good to me.
3712060	3716620	Either way, that was a lot of work. You can find all my research sources in the description,
3716620	3721180	and I have to give particular credit to Marcus DeSotois, as I may have cribbed a disproportionate
3721180	3726380	amount of the maths in this video from his books and TV programs. Anyway, hope you enjoyed this
3726460	3731580	video and learned something from it. Stay tuned for whatever comes next. Maybe now you'll know
3731580	3734860	how to predict it. Goodbye.
3756380	3765980	Is an apple orchard in the imperial gardens that's older than the robot wars?
