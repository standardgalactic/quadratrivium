1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,520
Hey, so does anyone remember Jurassic Park?

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,320
Jurassic Park is a film about many things.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
Dinosaurs obviously quite a big one, but then it's also about the risks of unchecked

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,280
science, the value of fatherhood, paying your software engineers a representative salary

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:28,320
that so destroy everything you know and love, and, most harrowing of all, mathematics.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,080
Elegantly summarizing the last half-century on the topic with its iconic line, life, uh,

7
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,720
finds a way, Jurassic Park introduced a blockbuster audience to the subfield of mathematics known

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,400
as chaos theory.

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,200
You know, the butterfly effect, small changes leading to large changes, ergo, dinosaur-themed

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,760
butt-goat splat.

11
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,920
But did it strike anyone else as odd how certain Dr. Malcolm was in his predictions about something

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,120
that he himself argued was unpredictable?

13
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,080
How did he actually know it wouldn't have turned out fine?

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,760
Where were the calculations?

15
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,880
Could it be that he couldn't predict anything after all?

16
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,560
I knew he wasn't a real mathematician, mathematicians don't have sex appeal.

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,360
In truth, there are some things we can predict with considerable precision.

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,240
We know how well a plane will fly before it even takes off.

19
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,200
We know where the planets will be millions of years into the future.

20
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,840
And we know Paul the Lever, Cronk, must inevitably be followed by...

21
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,600
Wrong Lever!

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,520
Why do I even have that Lever?

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,840
Anyway, hey, so does anyone remember Foundation?

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,120
Foundation is a book series written by acclaimed science fiction author Isaac Asimov.

25
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:50,160
Depending on how long it takes me to make this video, it will be, is, or was also a TV

26
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:56,280
series, created for Apple's new, current, or long-defunct streaming service, Apple TV.

27
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,080
Many view Foundation as Asimov's magnum opus.

28
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,320
Indeed, it beat Lord of the Rings to the Hugo Award for Best Ever Series.

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,880
An award Asimov himself believed was created specifically for Lord of the Rings to win.

30
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,760
Which is all the more amazing when you realise the central premise of the book is a mathematical

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,760
theory.

32
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,040
This time, though, it's less life finds a way, and more life doesn't.

33
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,760
Asimov imagined a field of study called psycho-history, which would plug the current state of a galactic

34
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,320
society into a model and predict its future.

35
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,280
Foundation explores the consequences of psycho-history across hundreds of years, the tantalising

36
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,920
prospect of society itself being predictable.

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,160
But would psycho-history actually hold up in the real world?

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,840
How do we square it with chaos theory in all those butterflies?

39
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,760
As someone who knows a fair bit about maths, and, incidentally, someone with exceptionally

40
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,800
low sex appeal, checkmate Spielberg, today I am on a mission to find out.

41
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,520
I've assembled some of the latest research into predicting human behaviour with maths,

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,280
along with the frightening reality of it that may already be happening, to understand where

43
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,360
we're heading in the field of understanding where we're heading, as well as to learn

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,200
what it takes to write fiction about prediction in the first place.

45
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,480
So I predict you are going to sit right there for the next 50-ish minutes and join me as

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:27,200
we ask, Foundation, are we predictable?

47
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,000
This video contains major spoilers for the Foundation book series, as well as minor spoilers

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:52,840
for the media currently on screen.

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,000
Few other names, nay, few other words, are so laden with science fiction mystique.

50
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,320
It almost sounds like a name from another planet, that of the planet being the Soviet

51
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Union.

52
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,240
Well, not quite, it was the Soviet Union's weird teenage phase when I hadn't quite

53
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,840
decided what it wanted to be yet, but whatever you call it, it was where Isaac Asimov was

54
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,000
born.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,920
And if you thought the where was unclear, don't get me started on the when.

56
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,440
Nobody, neither Asimov nor his own parents, knew the exact date.

57
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,640
The best they could do was arrange, so, without any better way to decide, Asimov chose his

58
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,340
birthday himself.

59
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,380
He went for the latest date possible, which, 25 years later, meant he was drafted into

60
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:38,100
World War II because he was only just inside the required age bracket.

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:41,580
Asimov's parents emigrated to the United States when he was three.

62
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:46,500
They opened a sweet shop selling, among other things, pulp sci-fi magazines.

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,140
No prizes for guessing where young Isaac found his influences.

64
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,100
Hell bent on writing sci-fi, at age 18, Asimov started submitting stories to John W. Campbell's

65
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,220
astounding science fiction.

66
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,020
His first few were rejected, but Campbell insisted that Asimov should continue submitting

67
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,860
to hone his craft, even agreeing to regular meetings together with the hope that one day

68
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,940
he'd write something successful.

69
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,820
I wish the employers who rejected me would do that, but it's not the 1930s anymore.

70
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,020
Asimov's first published story appeared in 1939, but it was 1941's Nightfall that

71
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,340
made his name.

72
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,500
The story of a planet that has but one night every few millennia, where everyone goes mad

73
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,820
because they don't know about stars, propelled him to sci-fi stardom.

74
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,620
And from there, the guy went a bit nuts.

75
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:35,220
Few authors in any genre have been so prolific, so inventive, and so influential.

76
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,900
Take iRobot.

77
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:42,060
Asimov found the robot subgenre a tired shadow, endlessly rehashing stories of creations turning

78
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,580
on creator that did little Mary Shelley's Frankenstein hadn't done a hundred years earlier.

79
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:50,060
He left it an ethically expansive world of new questions and possibilities that shape

80
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,780
our treatment of real AI to this day.

81
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:56,220
But then the film version came along and sent us all backwards again, so…

82
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Eh.

83
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,460
iRobot exemplifies the emphasis Asimov puts on big ideas.

84
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,820
It's a series of disconnected short stories that dissect a single topic from many angles,

85
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,460
poking and prodding his three laws of robotics to find the holes still present in a system

86
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,020
that does prevent robot uprisings.

87
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,540
The last question, possibly my favourite short story of all time, is similar.

88
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,500
Humanity returns to one question over and over in otherwise disparate vignettes throughout

89
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,900
the future, and is a pretty giant question to put it mildly.

90
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
But we aren't answering that one today.

91
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,020
Still a big one, but not that big.

92
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,140
Even my hubris has limits.

93
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,940
In 1941, Asimov was working at the Philadelphia Dockyard.

94
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,660
He hadn't had much time for writing.

95
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,340
He needed something new to show John Campbell in their upcoming meeting, something to blow

96
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,740
him away, but what?

97
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,340
Although he wasn't writing, he had been reading.

98
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,500
Specifically, reading Edward Gibbons' history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire,

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,740
a six-volume epic charting the fall of Rome and the factors responsible.

100
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,820
This gave him an idea, and led to a meeting that must have gone something like,

101
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:23,420
Alright Isaac, we need a new idea for a killer sapphire story.

102
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:28,620
Nobody had properly attempted a galactic empire before, much less than a count of its destruction.

103
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,260
We have foundation to thank for the empire in Star Wars, for instance, at least that's

104
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,900
what Asimov believed.

105
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:38,780
And being a space opera to film more recently than the 1970s, the Foundation TV show takes

106
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,820
obvious influence from Star Wars in return, proving we're all living in a big cultural

107
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
oraborus.

108
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,460
But Asimov wanted to go further than simply transposing the fall of Rome into space.

109
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:51,900
Gibbons theories had struck a chord with his love of examining human progress at the grandest

110
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,340
scale, and he couldn't help but ask himself, what if the fall had been predicted?

111
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,420
If, according to Gibbons, there were such clear factors in hindsight, would it not be possible

112
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,380
for someone to notice them at the time?

113
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,540
Combining the idea with his love for all things technological, Asimov went beyond even that.

114
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,740
What if someone applied the scientific method to such an insight?

115
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:17,260
What if they were able to turn history into a robust predictive science?

116
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,800
He called it psychohistory, that branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions

117
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,860
of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli.

118
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:29,460
Psychohistory can't predict an individual's behaviour.

119
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,740
It studies dynamics in aggregate.

120
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,300
The more people involved, the more accurate it becomes.

121
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Asimov likened it to physical systems like gases which we'll look at in more detail

122
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,300
later.

123
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:45,180
Discrete particles, humans, move in any which way they like, but the emergent flow of institutions

124
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,620
and incentive structures is highly predictable.

125
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:53,580
In universe, psychohistory is the invention of mathematician Harry Selden, who is very

126
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,700
much Asimov's self-insert.

127
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:00,780
He predicts the Galactic Empire will fall into chaos for 30,000 years, but creates a plan

128
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:06,060
to shorten that dark age to only 1,000 by establishing the Foundation, a new settlement

129
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,700
at the edge of the galaxy.

130
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,340
Initially, we're told the Foundation's task is to compile all knowledge into an encyclopedia

131
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:18,220
galactica, preserving it beyond the decline, but Selden's true plan was much more subtle.

132
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:22,340
He placed the Foundation in precisely the right spot to course correct the future evolution

133
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,140
of the galaxy, meeting a series of pivotal events known as Selden crises.

134
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:31,380
It would prevail against these crises not through the acts of great men or random chance, but

135
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,100
the inevitable march of social trends.

136
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,700
In 1942, Asimov published the first story set in the Foundation universe.

137
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:46,380
It and four others were later combined into the full-length novel Foundation in 1951.

138
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,740
Then came Foundation and Empire in 52 and Second Foundation in 53.

139
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:54,740
Asimov returned to the series much later, adding two sequels and two prequels in the

140
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,620
80s and 90s, thus completing the Foundation...septilogy?

141
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:03,660
I have the main trilogy in book form, and it might well be the most gorgeous-looking book

142
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,660
I own.

143
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,060
Oh, shiny.

144
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,140
Much like iRobot, the series challenges its premise from multiple angles across a long-disconnected

145
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,140
time span.

146
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,420
Here's a good example.

147
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,780
At one point in the second book, the Foundation has defeated every enemy except the remnants

148
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,820
of the Old Empire, still powerful enough to crush the Foundation's feeble military.

149
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,260
But they needn't worry.

150
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,180
The Empire is in a stalemate with itself.

151
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,100
In short, any general who conquers a Foundation would become a threat to the Emperor himself,

152
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,380
so the Emperor can't allow this to happen.

153
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,300
The Foundation therefore does nothing and...wins.

154
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,140
Asimov based this event on the real story of one Roman Emperor and his general, found

155
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,540
in decline and fall.

156
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,860
Writing a series like this must have been immensely challenging.

157
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,540
Its characters are fleeting and ineffectual, its focus sociological rather than psychological.

158
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,060
And that's not even touching on how one can create an entertaining story where everything

159
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,900
is preordained right from the beginning.

160
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,540
Sure, fiction is full of structure like character arcs, climaxes and resolutions and brick jokes.

161
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
What's a brick joke?

162
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,660
You know what, it's not important right now, we'll get to it later.

163
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,940
But canon structure built on mathematical prediction really work.

164
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,620
Well, I'll be diving into this in more detail in part 6, so pin that thought.

165
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:27,940
The effect of writing Foundation as such is that, well, it has some issues.

166
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,300
With a few notable exceptions, the characters have less dimension than a piece of string,

167
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,740
and the prose is brimming with more Technobabble than baby Apex Twin.

168
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:40,020
Admittedly, Asimov Technobabble is my kryptonite, so I'm good with it, but you shouldn't go

169
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,380
dashing out to read it if you have different sensibilities.

170
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,780
He's famous for his ideas, alright?

171
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,660
Those ideas did, however, make Foundation an enormous success.

172
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,460
Along with winning the Best ever series award, it cemented Asimov as THE great science fiction

173
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,620
writer.

174
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,540
Its impact is extensive.

175
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,740
Science fiction hasn't been the same since.

176
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,420
It shaped Dune, Star Wars, Hitchhiker, it was in the glovebox of Elon Musk's space

177
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,500
Tesla for crying out loud.

178
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,340
Further afield, Nobel Prize winner Paul Crouppen credits it with pushing him into economics.

179
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,180
The closest field to psycho-history you could find in the real world, but can we do better?

180
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:25,180
Let's get to the meat of this video and ask, is Asimov's psycho-history actually possible?

181
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,020
And for that, I'm afraid we need to use math.

182
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,220
Hot take.

183
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,220
Mathematics is in many things.

184
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:50,300
I hesitate to say everything because some smart ass in the comments is gonna ask, what

185
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,380
about the set of all things that aren't mathematics and cause some kind of paradox, but I digress.

186
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,780
Maybe I'm biased, but maths helps us understand so much and has opened so many doors for our

187
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,940
modern world that it might well be humankind's greatest ever invention.

188
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:10,300
Science is maths, engineering is maths, economics is maths, politics is maths, video games are

189
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:15,820
languages maths, if you squinted it, even music is maths, but you've all heard that one already.

190
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:21,260
We use maths in all its forms to understand the world, often with eerily good results.

191
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,980
For example, we began by describing real world shapes with real world geometry,

192
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,100
but with time, the maths dared us to imagine new geometries that didn't exist in our universe.

193
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,260
Then, out of nowhere, some guy called Albert used those imaginary geometries to build the

194
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:38,460
most accurate theory of physical motion we've ever known.

195
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,380
You might recognise him, and that's because his theory correctly predicted the weird position of

196
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,260
some stars during an eclipse and that shot him to stardom.

197
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,380
I didn't even plan that.

198
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,060
All in all, it's quite astonishing the power maths has to portray the real world.

199
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,380
Not that I know. I'm writing my master's dissertation on category theory.

200
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,180
Co-kill me now.

201
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,660
And with Einstein's eclipse example, we see maths is particularly well suited to the

202
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,460
field of prediction. Accurate observation and insightful theories mean we can forecast

203
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,700
planetary dynamics with stunning precision.

204
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,340
Take a look at Wikipedia's timeline of the far future, one of my favourite places on the

205
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,460
internet, and you'll see just how many astronomical events we're aware of billions of years in advance.

206
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,820
But before we can predict large things like planets and societies, we need to start small.

207
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,500
So, here's a familiar example.

208
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,820
Consider a cannon at ground level, pointing 45 degrees upwards,

209
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,420
which instantaneously accelerates a cannonball to 100 meters per second.

210
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,180
Factoring in air resistance, how far will the cannonball travel?

211
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:46,220
Thanks to the work of generations of mathematicians and physicists before us,

212
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,340
we don't even have to think.

213
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,380
We can simply plug these numbers into a big formula and know for certain where the ball will land.

214
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,740
Our prediction then aligns perfectly with reality.

215
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:06,780
Oh, there must have been a random gust of virtual wind or something.

216
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,620
Well, guess we won't be seeing that ball again.

217
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,300
No matter, let's try once more.

218
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,940
These same laws of physics are so effective, they tell us a building can withstand an

219
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,420
earthquake before a single brick has been laid.

220
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,300
Or how well a plane will fly without anything leaving the ground.

221
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,500
In more general terms, this is mathematical modelling.

222
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:34,060
Writing and solving equations to study real-world systems and predict their behaviour.

223
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,620
Psycho-history brings mathematical modelling to bear against humanity itself.

224
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,540
How would such a model work?

225
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,620
Asimov's main inspiration was the ideal gas law.

226
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,580
Gases are composed of trillions upon trillions of molecules,

227
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,980
all bashing into each other like a microscopic mosh pit.

228
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,740
Predicting each particle's behaviour is nigh on impossible,

229
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,340
but put enough together and the discontinuities are averaged out,

230
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:01,020
leaving only the overall movement of the gas in response to external pressures.

231
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,020
There's a video on YouTube where Professor Dan Crisan compares

232
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,740
psychohistory to heat transfer, a similar concept.

233
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,660
At the microscopic level, we have what's called a stochastic process.

234
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,780
Particles with more energy move faster and impart their energy to others through collisions,

235
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:20,460
but in a given region of this size, these collisions are effectively random.

236
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,300
Again though, zooming out reveals the emergent structure.

237
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,380
Heat flows from hot areas to cold.

238
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,980
At the macroscopic level then, there is a clear pattern in play.

239
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:34,700
Because there are so many particles, we can assume the system is continuous

240
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,780
and can write expressions known as differential equations to describe that pattern.

241
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,020
The solution to such an equation, if it exists but that's a story for another time,

242
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,500
then describes all those dynamics much more simply.

243
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,620
But there is important nuance here.

244
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,740
The equations assume continuity, that there is no smallest unit of the material,

245
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:54,940
when in fact we know there is.

246
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,900
Again, in practical terms, the particles are so small that our approximation is fine,

247
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,220
but this does highlight how modellers must be aware of the assumptions inherent in their descriptions.

248
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,380
We assumed that the outside of the material remains at a known temperature,

249
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,860
that the material is of uniform density,

250
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:15,180
that the laws of physics wouldn't change halfway through via sudden vacuum decay of the universe,

251
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,180
psycho history may not be a law of physics,

252
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,460
but that can't stop the power of mathematical models.

253
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,020
The Prime Minister has announced the most drastic limits to our lives that the UK has

254
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,420
ever seen in living memory.

255
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,140
The NHS will be unable to handle it.

256
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,860
A decision based on scientific projections

257
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,860
for how many thousands the virus might kill in the coming months.

258
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,180
Created scenarios will what might happen to the key metric of hospital admissions

259
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:48,220
with three different assumptions on how quickly...

260
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,660
Over the past two years, I've gone through several periods of near obsession

261
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,300
following models of the Covid-19 pandemic,

262
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
to the point that my mood on a given day

263
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,660
would depend on how that day's Covid statistics affected their predictions.

264
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,100
Unhealthy? Yeah, absolutely.

265
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,580
I think at the darkest points I needed their assurance

266
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,660
that there would be light at the end of the tunnel,

267
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,060
but they weren't always predicting light, were they?

268
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,180
My point is that population dynamics models,

269
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,260
in this case for a virus population,

270
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,500
held enormous sway over our lives recently.

271
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,340
Their might is evident.

272
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,100
Biological models make similar assumptions to physical ones.

273
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,380
Ignore individuals, zoom out to approximate continuity.

274
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,380
But because biological processes are arguably more complex

275
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,380
and less controllable than physical ones,

276
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,580
we need more assumptions.

277
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,100
This is why pandemic models disagree so often.

278
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,020
The maths never gives wrong answers.

279
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,460
We just feed it the wrong questions.

280
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,300
Outside of pandemics, we've used biological modelling

281
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,620
to understand predator-prey interactions

282
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,860
and humanity's effects on ecosystems,

283
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
such as figuring out sustainable fishing rates.

284
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,500
We're even simulating evolution itself.

285
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,260
Mathematical biology has exploded over the last half century.

286
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,580
More and more, we're finding biological systems are well suited to modelling,

287
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,500
suggesting psycho-history isn't as far removed from reality as it first seems.

288
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,460
I think if Asimov were writing Foundation Today,

289
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,420
he'd base psycho-history more on this than the physical sciences.

290
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,540
And as evidence, I present Jurassic Park.

291
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:18,620
A few of you may be surprised to learn that the film is based on a book.

292
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:23,260
Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park goes much harder into the biological maths,

293
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,660
and is so far the only instance I've ever seen

294
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,540
of a normal distribution being a major fictional plot point.

295
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,260
Plot point.

296
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,540
But Crichton took a much dimmer view of prediction than Asimov.

297
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,300
His mathematician self-insert is Dr. Ian Malcolm.

298
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,180
And we all know what he would think of psycho-history, don't we?

299
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,660
That is one big pile of shit.

300
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,940
In this land of many mysteries,

301
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,100
it's a strange fact that the largest legends seem to collect around the smallest creatures.

302
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,940
One of these is a mousy little rodent called the Lemming.

303
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,540
Here's an actual living legend.

304
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:14,140
For it's set of this tiny animal that it commits mass suicide

305
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,900
by rushing into the sea in droves.

306
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,100
In 1958, Disney put out a film called White Wilderness,

307
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,740
a documentary of life at the poles.

308
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,860
These days, it's infamous for one scene.

309
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,740
Contrary to the narrator's insistence,

310
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,660
the Lemmings were not voluntarily jumping from the cliff in a mass suicide attempt.

311
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,180
They were pushed.

312
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,020
The whole thing was fabricated.

313
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,340
White Wilderness didn't invent the legend of suicidal Lemmings,

314
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,180
that was part of existing folklore.

315
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,780
But it did bring it to the masses.

316
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,260
Nowadays, the word Lemming is synonymous with stupidity, death wishes,

317
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:56,140
and a pretty good video game for the 1990s that,

318
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,140
unfortunately still perpetuates the myth.

319
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,820
The myth arose due to extraordinary volatility in Lemming populations.

320
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:07,740
One year, a plague, the next near extinction, with no clear pattern.

321
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,060
With admittedly a few documented cases of Lemmings accidentally

322
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,300
driving each other off cliffs during migration,

323
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,620
mass suicide appeared the only explanation.

324
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,420
Though we're still not certain, today we have a much better guess.

325
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,660
Thanks, once again, to mathematics.

326
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,860
This is the Logistic Growth Map.

327
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,540
It's one possible model we can use for animal populations.

328
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,620
The population in year n is represented by xn,

329
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,060
so the equation tells us how to update the population for next year.

330
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,580
i.e. calculate xn plus 1, based on what it was last year.

331
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,660
The term R here represents the basic growth rate,

332
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,740
a measure of how quickly individuals reproduce.

333
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,660
Given an initial population and a growth rate,

334
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,460
we can hit the population with this map over and over again

335
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,980
to see how it develops year on year.

336
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,220
Notice it doesn't grow forever,

337
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,260
as the 1-xn term represents pressure from the environment

338
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,460
for the population to decline, such as a limit on food or space.

339
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,940
You'll notice that for some values of R,

340
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,260
the population eventually reaches a steady state.

341
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:12,940
After some initial wobbling, it reaches a stable level,

342
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,300
neither growing nor shrinking, as upward and downward pressures are balanced.

343
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,300
For others, it might settle into a repeating pattern,

344
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,420
up one year, down the next, oscillating between two values.

345
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,220
We can plot this behaviour on a graph.

346
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,180
The horizontal axis is the value of R,

347
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:32,060
the vertical axis is the steady state we eventually reach.

348
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,060
For R less than 1, all populations decline to extinction.

349
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,660
For R between 1 and 3, all populations approach some steady non-zero value.

350
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,340
Beyond 3, populations oscillate between two values.

351
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:49,660
Extending further, we get oscillations between 4 values and so on.

352
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,660
But beyond about 3.57, something rather silly happens.

353
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,700
The population never approaches a steady value

354
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,660
and instead jumps around unpredictably forever.

355
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:06,140
And Dr. Ian Malcolm is licking his lips because we've just discovered chaos theory.

356
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,100
Although Jurassic Park might give you the impression

357
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,060
that chaos theory is for the cool kids who aren't doing serious maths,

358
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,900
it is in fact a real field of study.

359
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,020
I know because I took an exam in it last year.

360
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,020
In 1961, Edward Lorenz was running calculations for weather forecasting

361
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,940
on these newfangled things called computers.

362
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,700
His forecast stored data to six decimal places.

363
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,660
Lorenz wanted to run the same calculations again,

364
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,020
but to save time, entered the data to only three decimal places.

365
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,620
He was astonished to find the outcomes differed wildly.

366
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,500
Sun became storms, storms became sun.

367
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,900
Small changes in initial conditions made the entire system unpredictable.

368
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,420
Lorenz published his findings in a paper that asked,

369
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,660
does the flap of a butterfly swing in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas,

370
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,060
enshrining the butterfly effect in the world's mind?

371
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,500
It's also a great example of mathematicians making discoveries by being lazy.

372
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,460
Chaotic systems like weather exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions.

373
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,580
Despite being fully deterministic, that is,

374
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:11,820
the future follows from the present by rigid laws, these systems appear random.

375
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,100
You can't predict them without perfect measurements,

376
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,940
which are effectively impossible to obtain.

377
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,140
The logistic map is one such system.

378
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,740
A growth rate beyond 3.57 produces chaos.

379
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,620
Your predictions add the mercy of how precisely you know

380
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,740
both the starting population and the reproduction rate,

381
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,860
off by even one individual and you might as well be rolling dice.

382
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,700
Here then, we find a potential solution to our lemming problem.

383
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,380
Lemmings, you see, reproduce very quickly.

384
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,460
The point is debated, but some estimates suggest their adjusted growth rate

385
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,900
exceeds the chaos threshold, though usually in other models,

386
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,620
I just used the logistic map as a simpler example.

387
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,980
According to Wikipedia, lemmings are some of the few vertebrates

388
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:57,660
which reproduce so quickly that their population fluctuations are chaotic.

389
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,700
Hmm, and there's even a source for this claim.

390
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,700
Fascinating.

391
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:03,740
Thanks, Peter Turchin.

392
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,740
Interesting name that.

393
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,220
If lemming populations follow a suitable model,

394
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,780
and if they do reproduce this quickly,

395
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:14,540
then it seems reasonable for chaos theory to hold the true explanation.

396
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,660
So if you take one thing from this video,

397
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,100
let it be that lemmings only exists because of insatiable libido.

398
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,500
Chaos theory may then be an insurmountable obstacle to psycho-history.

399
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,300
If we can't predict the weather beyond a few days,

400
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,580
what hope do we have to predict thousands of years of galactic society?

401
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,980
If a butterfly can cause a tornado,

402
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,300
why can't a single human change the course of history?

403
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,820
But don't go thinking we've outwitted Asimov here,

404
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,060
because Foundation asks the same question.

405
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,780
The second half of Foundation and Empire introduces one of my favourite villains

406
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,740
in all of literature.

407
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,380
A space warlord forging a new empire from the ruins of the old,

408
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,620
bringing countless star systems under his control

409
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,020
and sowing paralyzing fear in those still standing.

410
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,940
They call him The Mule, perhaps for his great strength.

411
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:08,460
Citizens of the Foundation guess his rise to power must be the latest Seldon crisis,

412
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,940
so they gather to listen to Seldon's hologram recording,

413
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,380
which will tell them why they're destined to win and that they can sit back and relax.

414
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,740
Everything goes a bit to pot when Seldon starts babbling about a non-existent civil war instead.

415
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,780
Whoops.

416
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,500
The Mule then conquers the entire Foundation.

417
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,020
Whoops.

418
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:28,940
We later learn the Mule's secret weapon is a genetic mutation,

419
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,860
giving him some form of mind control.

420
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,340
He can command others' emotions, manipulating them to build an empire for him.

421
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,060
We also learn he was an unassuming clown called Magnifico the whole time.

422
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:44,220
The protagonists only get to jump on him because one takes a genuine liking to him,

423
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,860
and the Mule lets his guard down because he can't bring himself to interfere

424
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,180
with the one piece of genuine affection anyone's ever felt for him

425
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,980
in his life of disgust and derision that drove him to conquer the entire galaxy

426
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,900
in a single-minded act of revenge for how it treated him.

427
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,980
Well done, Azimov.

428
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,420
You wrote a good character for once.

429
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Even more so because the Mule is Foundation's avatar for chaos theory,

430
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,460
or at least the notion of it that existed in Azimov's time.

431
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,820
Seldon did not and could not predict a random change to one person's DNA.

432
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,420
That change nonetheless spiralled into a big old butterfly of an effect.

433
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,380
Some critics have noted there are other aspects of chaos inherent in psycho history,

434
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,500
such as technology.

435
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,220
If Seldon could predict the date and impact of a galaxy-altering invention,

436
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,460
he basically knew enough to invent it himself.

437
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,780
Look at steampower or the internet and their radical impacts on our lives, for instance.

438
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,660
Would someone living before the steam train have any hope of predicting modern social dynamics?

439
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,860
But all hope is not yet lost.

440
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,580
Because while chaos theory is a major hurdle, it's not always all it's cracked up to be.

441
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,820
Even though I can't tell you exactly what the weather will do two weeks from now,

442
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,500
I can reliably predict its average behaviour for quite a bit longer.

443
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,820
For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, we'll see cold temperatures for the next few

444
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,380
months before a gradual period of warming into the summer.

445
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,340
Here in the UK, most of that period will be grey and miserable.

446
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,420
There will be storms here or there, which may or may not be caused by colourful flying insects,

447
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,460
but overall they will have little impact on most weather patterns.

448
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,660
It's a bit like rolling dice. Each roll is chaotic, deterministic,

449
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:19,180
but subject to incalculable tiny variations, yet enough together will always follow known statistics.

450
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,580
Even one of the poster children for chaos theory, the Lorenza Tractor, features order

451
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:31,180
among the chaos. It's a picture of airflow under convection inside a box. While the parts of the

452
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:36,380
air particles vary wildly, they still remain on the two main swells. In other words,

453
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,460
the specific trajectories can't be predicted, but the overall movement can.

454
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:46,620
Again, we're talking about averages in the aggregate. One atom is highly unlikely to

455
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,300
change the directions of trillions upon trillions. That's not to say it's impossible though,

456
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,020
but only for some systems, and it's hard to tell whether a given real world phenomenon is one of

457
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:03,660
them. But Harry Selden knew it was still a possibility. He accounted for it. Despite the

458
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:10,220
mules won in a quadrillion paradigm shift, Selden still had the last laugh. To see how we need to

459
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:16,060
move beyond atoms and lemmings. After all, they may be predictable, but we humans are so much more

460
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:32,380
advanced. Right? Why don't we play a fun game of rock, paper, scissors? I'll count us in,

461
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:42,140
we'll throw our hands on go, and you let me know who won in the comments. Ready? Three, two, one, go.

462
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:50,860
On the face of it, rock, paper, scissors is a random game. The choices are equally powerful,

463
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,540
and there's no inherent reason to choose one over another. Much like dice, with many trials,

464
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,340
the results should average out. One third of you should have lost to me, one third should have won,

465
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:06,300
and one third should have drawn. If that's the case though, why are there rock, paper, scissors

466
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:13,020
world champions? Yes, those exist. It's possible to consistently beat the odds because, in the hands

467
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:18,540
of humans, the game isn't random at all. Skilled players pick up on patterns and ticks and second

468
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:23,900
guessing to exploit the flaws in their opponent's thought processes. It even worked with this video.

469
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:28,380
If you know my patterns, you know I can't resist the temptation to make a terrible visual joke and

470
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,900
would never throw Dwayne Johnson. On a more general level, our brains exhibit cognitive biases that

471
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,460
make us more predictable than we'd like to believe, but I spoke about these at length in my diplomacy

472
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,020
video so I'll say no more here. What we're interested in today is how we can cash in on

473
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,740
these thought patterns with maths. And, perhaps unsurprisingly by now, there's a lot of scope

474
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:54,300
here. Take, as a morbid example, crime. Unless they're taking specific steps to avoid it,

475
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,020
criminals tend to commit crimes with a geographic pattern. When they commit multiple crimes,

476
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:04,140
the pattern strengthens and we can use this to narrow down investigations. As one example,

477
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,180
they may not act too close to home to avoid arousing suspicion, but don't want to put too

478
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,900
much effort into travelling and hence have an upper limit on distance too. Put these into a

479
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,100
formula and you generate a probability distribution that suggests the best places to find your suspects

480
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:24,860
given their crime locations. This technique is called geographic profiling. On the rise for

481
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,580
the last few decades, it's helped catch a fair number of serial criminals. Some have even used

482
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,100
it to retroactively predict the home of Jack the Ripper. As another example, consider the flow of a

483
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:41,820
crowd. Studies of ant swarms and fish shoals reveal that our movement isn't so different. We run on

484
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:46,620
autopilots and there are simple rules behind our movement, so we can save mental energy for more

485
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:51,420
important things like checking our phones. We can use these rules to design safer or more efficient

486
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:56,380
buildings. My favourite example is that placing an obstacle in the middle of a large hall can

487
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:01,980
actually improve traffic flow as it hacks like a roundabout. See America? It's completely natural.

488
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:07,580
All this points to at least some capacity to predict human behaviour even at the level of

489
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,780
individuals, which brings us to Asimov's next addition to the Foundation Universe, the second

490
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:19,020
Foundation. In the third book of the main trilogy, we discover Selden established two foundations,

491
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:25,180
one a blunt acts of technology and military might, the other a secretive puppet master scalpel.

492
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,820
The second foundation was to develop psycho history beyond Selden's groundwork,

493
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,580
making it more resilient to the whims of individuals and perhaps predicting actions

494
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:38,380
at a more granular scale. To do this, they explored the science of the human mind,

495
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,020
the ways it can be read and controlled. Unfortunately for this analysis, it does this

496
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:49,100
by having its members all be telepathic. Bit of a cheat code there. When the mule threatens

497
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:52,940
the Selden plan, the second foundation comes out of hiding to correct the aberration.

498
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:58,460
By predicting and shifting the actions of single humans, the second foundation suggests a much

499
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:05,340
finer version of psycho history and one that is self-correcting. But also telepathy, so yeah.

500
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:11,740
Despite the highlighted cases, we're still pretty far off forecasting the future of individuals.

501
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:16,540
Even if our brains exhibit patterns, our lives around them still appear for the most part

502
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:21,180
too chaotic. Countless events every day shape our future in ways we may never know.

503
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,700
We're forced then to retrace our steps back to psycho history proper, the prediction of

504
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:31,820
larger incentive structures. With the mathematical tools we've developed, are we any closer to

505
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:37,020
improving on Paul Krugman's substitutes of economics? Can we sidestep chaos theory to

506
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:42,620
truly build a model for humanity? Well, this would be a pretty disappointing video if I hadn't found

507
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:47,740
something, so ladies, gentlemen and others, please, put your hands together for the actual

508
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:56,860
real-world manifestation of psycho history. Clio Dynamics. Alright, alright, I'll get to that,

509
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:02,700
just let me explain what it is first. Guess I gotta cross Clio Dynamics off my controversial

510
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:11,500
topics for a YouTube video bingo card. Coined in 2003, Clio Dynamics is the term for the field

511
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:16,140
of study that mathematicalizes history. By collecting quantitative historical data,

512
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:21,020
its aim is to use statistical and modelling techniques to find the laws that dictate societal

513
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:26,460
progress. Much of the work on Clio Dynamics has been spearheaded by one man, Professor

514
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:32,540
of Ecology, Anthropology and Mathematics at the University of Connecticut, Peter Turchin. Hold on.

515
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:41,260
And there's even a source for this claim. Fascinating. Thanks, Peter Turchin.

516
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:48,380
I swear I found these two things independently. Turchin's background is in Beatles. He cut

517
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:51,900
his teeth studying their population dynamics, which of course we know all about now,

518
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,420
and the dynamics of other species, like lemmings. And he does indeed suggest lemmings may be one

519
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,060
of the few creatures exhibiting chaotic fluctuations. He moved on from ecology after

520
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:06,380
deciding he knew everything there was to know about Beatles, now setting himself the loftier

521
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:11,900
goal of studying humans. He believes that history, like biology, is ripe for being turned into

522
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:18,140
mathematics, and founded the journal Clio Dynamics to begin the task. Turchin's notoriety rose in

523
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:23,420
2010 when he announced that his work suggested a coming age of unrest in America. He became

524
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:28,380
even more famous in 2020 because his 2010 prediction said that would be the year when things would

525
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:36,140
get serious. Hmm. In Turchin's words, history as a subject is good at explaining the past.

526
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:42,220
Too good, in fact, and he cites one historian who had collated 210 competing theories for the

527
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:47,660
fall of Rome, making it incredibly difficult to choose between them. In my video Analyzing

528
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,980
a Darkling Plane, I compared that book's portrayal of societal demise to the Bronze Age

529
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:57,260
collapse, and we see a similar thing there. Theories ranging from spearmen emerging from the ocean,

530
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:02,380
to earthquakes, to an overly complex society falling in on itself in a process historian

531
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:07,740
Eric Klein calls systems collapse. This last one has a certain whiff of psycho history, if you ask me.

532
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,580
Clio Dynamics takes such hypotheses, translates them into mathematical models, and tests them

533
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:19,100
against databases spanning thousands of years. The hope is to identify the most plausible theories,

534
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,380
and with them, the mathematical laws of history, much like we have laws of physics and, increasingly,

535
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:30,460
laws of biology. Whether Clio Dynamics is really about predicting the future or only has use explaining

536
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,860
past trends depends on where you look. Turchin sometimes says yes, but sometimes says no,

537
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,260
citing some of the issues we've gone through already, while journalists representing his work

538
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:45,820
side emphatically with yes. And while it lets you write clickbait headlines like

539
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:51,100
the next decade could be even worse, can you really blame them? Because Clio Dynamics has

540
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:56,460
borne fruit. Despite countless differences between cultures that could have chaos-style effects,

541
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:02,540
there are, according to Turchin, consistent trends. Secular cycles are one such trend.

542
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,660
Apparent rhythms in boom and bust across time, driven by processes like elite overproduction.

543
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:13,020
Here, Clio Dynamics models suggest collapses are often preceded by a common social shift.

544
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:18,060
Namely, the funneling of more people into elite positions than there are elite positions available.

545
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,980
The theory goes that these shunned elites become the revolutionaries.

546
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,700
Even if you claim not to be in the business of prediction, forming such a model leads you down

547
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:31,580
that path. And yes, Turchin concludes that we're heading for the next crash as we speak.

548
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:36,700
But he can't predict the spark. Only the accumulation of fuel it can ignite.

549
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:43,820
Spoken like a true psycho-historian. As it happens, Foundation was a formative influence on Turchin.

550
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:47,820
He surely sometimes believes he is making Seldon's dream a reality. But it's no

551
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:52,380
surprise the man who considered chaotic lemmings has some criticisms of Asimov's predictive

552
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,380
machinery. He says that chaos theory makes mules of all of us, wrecking any hope for true precision.

553
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:02,940
He also takes issue with Seldon's insistence that his plan should remain a mystery.

554
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,060
Asimov spends most of Second Foundation arguing that knowing psycho-history's

555
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:13,020
prophecies ahead of time renders them useless. After coming out of hiding to defeat the mule,

556
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,140
the Second Foundation must convince the galaxy it has itself been crushed, lest the Seldon plan go

557
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:24,220
awry. In real life, this is called the uncertainty principle of the social sciences. Even with chaos

558
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,540
in the mix, forecasting the weather won't change the weather. Make a prediction in economics,

559
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:33,020
though, and you might bring about the crash you sought to prevent. Simplified to the point of

560
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,820
irritating economists, that's all the field is. Things having value because they're forecast to

561
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:42,860
have value. Game stop notwithstanding. But Turchin says clear dynamics can survive this,

562
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,900
because who cares about one odd professor's thoughts on the future?

563
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:52,780
The trouble is, quite a few people do. Right, you can bring back your pitchforks now.

564
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,140
Historians have not taken kindly to a mathematician coming along to tell them

565
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,300
they're all studying history wrong. And, weirdly, neither have the mathematicians.

566
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,300
Now, I'm not qualified to say either way, but I've seen enough claims that

567
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:11,420
Turchin's methodology is questionable to give them some weight. He's been accused of cherry

568
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,660
picking data to suit his conclusions, for instance, and prophesising historical trends to

569
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:21,580
shape policy recommendations has drawn some… unwelcome comparisons. Plus, you can't ignore

570
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:27,980
the survivorship bias. I can make a prediction that the world will end on the 9th of January

571
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:33,900
2031, and I'll join the long list of very wrong doomsday profits throughout history.

572
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:39,820
I hope. Turchin divined 2020, but we don't care about everyone who said 2019, do we?

573
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:44,860
But far and away the most common critique is that reducing history to numbers removes all

574
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:49,180
the nuance and context that's necessary to understand it at all. It's similar to the

575
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:53,900
criticism leveled against creators of so-called mega-histories, accounts of the big picture

576
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,060
which eschew the details in favour of high-level patterns. I need only mention guns,

577
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,940
germs, and steel to be marked anti-history for life. In general, historians believe that

578
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:07,900
society is simply too complex to predict. There are so many theories for the fall of Rome or

579
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,980
the Bronze Age collapse because there are so many things that can affect it. Sure,

580
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,300
we can plot a few of them on time series graphs, but none of them can ever come close to the full

581
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,260
picture. I'm reminded here of the notorious study on the decline of modern music from a few

582
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:27,180
years ago. It measured a few ill-chosen datasets without necessary context and called it a day.

583
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,780
I direct you towards YouTuber Tantacruel's evisceration of it for more detail.

584
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,740
But for any and all faults of Clear Dynamics as Turchin has created it,

585
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,460
I can't help but see the appeal of his counter-argument here.

586
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,660
Namely, that the complexity of society does not make maths a poor analysis tool.

587
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,220
Rather, it makes it the perfect analysis tool.

588
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,540
How did we predict the weather before maths? Cows and frogs mostly.

589
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:55,500
Empirical forecasts were mocked when they were invented, yet today we can't do without them,

590
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,820
even with chaos getting in the way. They do so much better than anything we had before.

591
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:04,860
By phrasing problems like this in mathematical terms, we have been able to make complex systems

592
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:11,100
palatable to our feeble and bias-ridden minds. But maybe it's all still too convoluted.

593
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,180
In the conclusion to his talk on the reality of psycho-history,

594
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:18,860
Dan Crissan states that he believes all the mathematical ingredients are there.

595
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:24,700
We just need the recipe. What then if our big brains are simply too dumb to make that recipe?

596
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,180
Is this all a lost cause regardless?

597
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,660
Well, we aren't the only big brains on this planet anymore, are we?

598
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:38,860
Actually, before we get to that, I'm going to interrupt with some stop-press. Sorry,

599
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,380
it wouldn't fit anywhere else. As I was putting this final video together,

600
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:47,020
the internet rediscovered a study which predicts the end of civilization in the 2040s.

601
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:50,700
That study was a 2020 reassessment of a prediction from the 70s,

602
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,900
which formed its conclusion with similar modelling approaches to cleodynamics.

603
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:57,820
I suppose I can take this opportunity to emphasise that there are indeed many studies

604
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:01,740
of this sort out there. Turchin's cleodynamics is just one of the more developed.

605
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,620
According to the recent assessment, we've matched some of the more grim

606
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:09,740
trajectories worryingly closely. Hence, you know, headlines claiming MIT predicts the end of the

607
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,820
world. I haven't had time to look into this properly, but I do have two points to make.

608
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:18,220
First, that these studies aren't immune to the problems of context and nuance that may hold

609
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,500
back cleodynamics. Second, in my initial research, I found a few solid refutations of similar

610
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:28,860
arguments also made in the 70s, such as forecasts of sudden population decline that decade due to

611
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:33,820
mass starvation. As it turned out, new technologies improved the globe's agricultural output and

612
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:39,260
stopped that happening, so technological chaos may in fact have saved us and could indeed save us again.

613
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:42,460
But that's all I have to say on that. Back to the video.

614
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:53,260
Consider Netflix.

615
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,180
On opening Netflix, other streaming services are available. I'm greeted with a selection of

616
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,420
films and TV shows that may be to my liking. It's in Netflix's interests that they're

617
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,580
to my liking. If they get it wrong and show me stuff I don't like, I'll conclude the service

618
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:12,780
has nothing of value and stop paying them. So Netflix needs to predict what films I will like.

619
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,420
Humans have easy shorthands for decisions like this. We can identify genre, personnel, tone,

620
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:23,580
and so on, and there's a strong chance that these will correlate with potential future favorites.

621
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,980
But if you strip that information away, can you still make good predictions?

622
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,540
This was the challenge Netflix posed in 2006. They ran a contest inviting people to improve

623
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:39,980
their film recommendation algorithm based on nothing but an enormous set of user film ratings,

624
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:44,940
over 2 million data points that each looked like this. Triples of user, film, and rating

625
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,540
identifiers together with the date. The hammer you need for such a nail of a problem is machine

626
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:55,820
learning. Using some complicated concepts I have no time to explain like higher dimensional graphs,

627
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,580
gradient descent, and a whole bunch of linear algebra, machine learning is about designing

628
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:04,540
computer algorithms that update their own inner workings. Feed them a massive amount of training

629
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:08,140
data along with some way of telling them how good a job they did analyzing that data,

630
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,860
and they will literally learn. With only a few years of work and petabytes of data,

631
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,980
they can identify features it takes humans milliseconds to recognize.

632
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,980
Ah, the concerning thing is that it's all a black box. The innards of the algorithm are known

633
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:27,660
only to that algorithm. We provide the ingredients and eat the meal, but nobody knows the recipe.

634
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:33,580
The most successful entries to Netflix's contest used machine learning or similar.

635
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:37,660
They could correctly predict people's movie tastes with no understanding of those movies

636
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:43,260
except other people's tastes. Like our usual top-down view, this bottom-up approach correctly

637
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:49,020
classified recognizable features like genres without any human input. This proved a breakthrough

638
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:54,140
in online content delivery. Nowadays, Netflix uses metrics like watch time, click rates,

639
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:58,860
and other numerical viewing patterns to recommend content. Everything run by machines to deal with

640
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:04,140
the enormous data load. But what's truly spooky and of use to us in this video is that these

641
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,020
algorithms can identify features we don't recognize. Groupings of films that have no

642
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:14,220
obvious connection yet have reliable predictive power. If I like one, I'll like the other.

643
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,940
Even if, as far as we can tell, they're wildly different.

644
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,420
The YouTube algorithm does something similar, which is why my analytics tell me I owe half

645
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,100
the success of my channel to this one completely unrelated video by Luke Correa.

646
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:29,660
On that note, don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe because the YouTube algorithm is

647
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,700
a fickle mistress. Machine learning has already transformed the internet and how we experience

648
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:39,100
it. It's certainly responsible for my YouTube success, the most important part,

649
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:44,700
so I feel confident in saying that. So, can we harness this AI powerhouse to predict more than

650
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:54,780
just videos? Can it predict everything? This is GDELT, the global database of events, language,

651
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:00,620
and tone. Founded in 2013, the GDELT project aims to collect and analyze vast amounts of

652
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:06,620
digital data pouring out from humanity. Its archives go back to 1979, but since 2013,

653
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:11,580
it's been collecting data every single day. Today, you can access the GDELT dataset on the

654
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:17,580
Google Cloud platform. The vision of its creator, Kalev Litaru, is forecasting the future based on

655
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:22,860
patterns and connections identified on a grand scale. He claims, for example, that his data

656
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:29,100
predicted the Arab Spring. After it had happened, but still, GDELT uses emerging techniques to

657
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:34,220
translate news articles, social media posts, and photos into quantitative measures of events and

658
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:39,500
our emotions about those events. It then hits all that with the big machine learning hammer to extract

659
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:46,300
unseen insights and, just maybe, predict the future. It's a faintly terrifying thought.

660
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,700
Everything we broadcast here on the internet will find its way to an enormous computer brain that

661
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:56,140
may or may not know what we're about to do before we do it. GDELT isn't the only attempt to

662
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:01,580
outsource societal prediction to the machines. There's Project Cassandra, run by a German team

663
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:06,540
aiming to predict the future using novels. There's Guard, the Alan Turing Institute's contribution

664
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:12,060
to military prediction in Britain. And in the US, there's the disturbingly named Global Information

665
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:16,780
Dominance Experiment spearheaded by the Pentagon. And these are just the ones we know about.

666
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,900
Really, with these projects and many others like them out there, we might as well be under AI

667
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,980
governance already. The machines took control and we didn't even notice.

668
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,300
This was not a development that escaped Isaac Asimov.

669
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:38,300
The final two books of the Foundation series, Foundation's Edge and Foundation in Earth,

670
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:43,100
take place hundreds of years after Second Foundation. In the latter, the characters make

671
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:48,380
a startling discovery about the origins of psycho-history. On the moon of an abandoned and

672
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:53,820
highly irradiated planet once called Earth, they find an ancient robot named Ar Daniel Olivore.

673
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:59,180
Olivore reveals he's been manipulating humanity for millennia and that it was he who put the idea

674
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:04,620
for psycho-history in Seldon's head in the first place. While it somewhat undermines the premise

675
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,420
of the entire Foundation series, this does show Asimov new robots would take well to societal

676
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:15,020
prediction. At the time he joined the Foundation series, Olivore was already a well-worn character.

677
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,660
He appeared in several Asimov stories and is representative of Asimov's attempts

678
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:23,260
in his later years to bring his works together into a single shared universe.

679
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,980
iRobot in particular therefore takes place in the same continuity as Foundation,

680
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,740
and the last story in that collection reveals similar thoughts on society-level AI

681
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:37,020
much earlier in Asimov's work. It tells of how supercomputers proved so adept at running the

682
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,820
world's economy that humans put them in charge, ushering in a new age of global utopia.

683
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:51,020
Unfortunately it's not the 1950s anymore. For good or bad, it looks like planet-level

684
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:56,300
prediction at the hands of AI is inevitable. And with enough data and computing power,

685
00:48:56,300 --> 00:49:01,340
surely the sky's the limit. We could find hidden connections impossible to see without AI everywhere.

686
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,700
We could truly predict everything.

687
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:11,420
Well, video's over people. The question has been answered. We are indeed predictable.

688
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,060
Pack it up, we're done here.

689
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,340
In June last year, some guy called Denny tweeted about a machine learning algorithm he'd designed

690
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:29,420
for depixelating low-resolution faces. The program produced a fake but realistic human face that,

691
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,060
when downscaled, would recover the original image.

692
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,660
People on Twitter, ever the experimental bunch, had a bit of fun with it.

693
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:41,100
Here's the doom guy, for instance, now a real boy. Not half as cursed as the laughing emojis

694
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:47,660
true form, though. And of course, we all know who this is, right? I mean, even a child could tell you.

695
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,860
Who's that Pokemon?

696
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,100
Oh. Oh no.

697
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:05,260
Oh no. Yeah, the algorithm kind of changed Barack Obama's entire racial profile? Every time?

698
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,660
It isn't unique to Obama. Feed in anyone who isn't obviously white and you get… well,

699
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,060
you get a white person. The accuracy of machine learning depends on the quality of its training

700
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,900
data. In this case, the dataset likely had inherent bias. The algorithm had not seen enough

701
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:26,620
diverse faces to identify them. And if you think this problem is limited to funny missteps on

702
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:31,420
the internet, consider the case of Robert Julian Borchuk Williams. He was arrested for a crime

703
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:35,100
he didn't commit because a facial recognition algorithm couldn't tell the difference between

704
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:40,860
him and another black man. This is far from the only case of machine learning getting it wrong.

705
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:45,580
How about the turtle made out of pictures of guns that Google's AI thought was itself a gun?

706
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:50,860
Or the US military's tank detection AI that actually detected the weather? All the photos

707
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:55,340
of tanks that had been fed were taken on a sunny day and, because no one knew it's inner workings,

708
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:00,220
nobody noticed that it was picking up on the wrong thing. Even Netflix's algorithm famously

709
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:05,180
tripped up trying to classify Napoleon Dynamite. The film was so polarizing that its rating pattern

710
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:09,980
didn't look like that of any other film in the database. But aren't all these problems simply

711
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:15,500
a question of gathering more training data? Kind of, but there's a more fundamental problem at play.

712
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,420
The no-free lunch theorem is a mathematical result that, essentially, states that there is no

713
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:27,180
universal learning algorithm that can predict outcomes accurately in every scenario. No matter

714
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,820
its training data, it will always be possible to cook up something to foil the machine. That

715
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,980
something may be weird and pathological, but finding it out there in the real world is always

716
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:43,020
a possibility. We have mathematical proof of it. So even if you solved the bias and diversity issues

717
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:47,420
plaguing the AI industry, which is an enormous task in itself, you're out of luck in your hopes

718
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:52,860
to build an infallible automated prognosticator. Sure, you can build a good one, but we don't yet

719
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:59,820
know how good. Perhaps the utopia of AI running the world for us is, in fact, impossible.

720
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:20,620
So, after all that, after attacking every angle through a multitude of perspectives,

721
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,660
we are now ready to answer the question. Are we predictable?

722
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:29,660
Probably not.

723
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:35,580
Look, I'm not qualified to tell you what to think here, which begs the question of why

724
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:39,340
I'm making a video about this in the first place. But in my opinion, from all the evidence we've

725
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,780
looked at, I don't think psychohistory is possible. For all I've praised mathematics,

726
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,740
it doesn't exist in a vacuum. Models require assumptions, and we're often terrible at phrasing

727
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,060
them. Whether they're assumptions about continuity or datasets being representative,

728
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:58,460
they can cause problems. And when we're dealing with the grandest scale there is,

729
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,700
we have to make lots of assumptions. Chaos has the power to prey on them,

730
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:08,060
to render predictions about complex systems moot. It can't kill every model, but we don't yet know

731
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:13,340
where history itself lies on this spectrum. And while I like the philosophy of clear dynamics,

732
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:17,900
using maths to break through these complex systems, in its current form it can be

733
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,940
sketchy in places. And even its creator believes chaos will inevitably rip it apart.

734
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,580
With all we've looked at, we've made progress. But psychohistory as Asimov imagined it appears,

735
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:34,220
to me at least, forever too distant. You might have come to a different conclusion,

736
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:39,180
and that's fine. As I said, take everything I say with a big pinch of salt. I welcome

737
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:44,860
differing opinions in the comments. But since I don't want to end this video on that anti-climax,

738
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,580
I'm going to devote this last section to something different.

739
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:54,140
Because foundation isn't solely a mathematical theory. It's also, and hear me out on this,

740
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:01,100
a book. We may or may not be predictable. But what about our fiction? What can foundation

741
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:08,060
tell us about that? Fiction is full of structure. We like to think it's an unrestricted outpouring

742
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:13,260
of creative invention, but in reality it has plenty of rules, both explicit and implicit.

743
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:17,260
In the most extreme examples, you have things like La Dispassion,

744
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:21,820
where Georges Perrec goes the entire book without a single letter E. But outside of

745
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:26,300
novelties like this, we're still drawn to particular formats. Theories like The Hero's

746
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:30,540
Journey save the cat and even Dan Harmon's story circle, try to figure out what these are,

747
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,260
and have had tremendous influence on media. At the lower level, you can't even tell a joke

748
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,820
without invoking some sort of predictable structure. We know Paul the Leverkronk must be

749
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:44,780
followed by Wrong Lever, because it and similar jokes have conditioned us to expect it,

750
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:50,300
and that's often what makes it funny. I even rely on predictable formats for these video essays,

751
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:55,260
because they give easy shortcuts for clarity, rhythm and comedy. A good drinking game to play

752
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,940
with them would be to drink every time I use the rule of three, for instance, or a long,

753
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:02,780
stoic paragraph with a short, stupid quip at the end. Or this music.

754
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:08,780
I'm contractually obliged to use that in every video essay.

755
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,140
And although lol's so randomness can also work for humour,

756
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,940
it's not usually an effective way to write a whole story.

757
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:20,380
For example, if a story doesn't give a satisfying payoff at the very end, people don't tend to

758
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:25,260
like it. We can therefore predict that there will be a satisfying payoff, or at least an attempt at

759
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:30,060
one. Neither will audiences take kindly to coincidences, although these can work if handled

760
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,540
well. But if unpredictable and convenient events keep appearing, it feels cheap.

761
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:39,100
This is, however, reserved for fiction only, and as evidence I present Dave Gorman's Google

762
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:44,300
Wacadventure, the greatest exploration of coincidence ever put to film. And on that note,

763
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,860
Googling prediction in fiction shows you a load of children's activities meant to teach them

764
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,180
what to expect in a story. From a young age, we're all aware of how it should work.

765
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:58,860
But blindly sticking to such rules everywhere is one surefire way to make something horrendously

766
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:03,820
boring and of no artistic value to anyone ever. There are predictable aspects to fiction,

767
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:09,180
but to survive, it has to embrace unpredictability as well. It's a constant tug-of-war between

768
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:15,100
meeting expectations and, yes, subverting expectations. It's a bit like music. On one

769
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:19,820
extreme, you have repetitive monocodal corporate elevator music, and on the other you have Arnold

770
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:31,100
Schoenberg. Most people can't stand either. They arguably prefer a happy medium where the

771
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:36,300
flow feels natural, yet unexpected at the same time. One where each moment teeters on the edge

772
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:42,060
of our expectations, sometimes meeting them, sometimes not. You can't have a story go exactly

773
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:47,340
to a preordained plan, just as much as you can't keep throwing random fluff around. Most of the

774
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:52,540
time, storytelling lives in this limbo between narratives recycled and narratives invented,

775
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:58,940
and Foundation exemplifies this more than anything. Foundation is a story about history that recycles

776
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:05,820
history itself, but even today its structure seems odd. It's not a gripping yarn of human

777
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,300
drama and the arcs of individuals, separating it from most of the fiction we recognize,

778
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:15,020
and that does make it a difficult read for some people. No great heroes to root for or

779
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:21,020
villains to hate. No deep or emotional examinations of characters' psyches. Just the march of history.

780
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:28,300
The approach is certainly unconventional in fiction. How, then, can one possibly go about

781
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:34,300
adapting such a thing for television? Yes, the elephant can come out from hiding in the corner.

782
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:40,300
I've heard and read many opinions on the TV show, but to talk about it I decided I should at least

783
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:45,740
watch some of it myself. Yes, I subscribed to Apple TV just to make this video. Let's

784
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:51,180
hope my ad revenue can cover that. I don't envy the creators. Merging as a mob's giant but

785
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:56,540
rather sterile vision with the intimate personal drama expected of TV shows sounds painful.

786
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:05,500
Unfortunately for my money it all came out a bit… meh. I mean, space elevator. Big yes.

787
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:10,060
Less homogenous characters. Big yes. Straining to live up to its own mega historical aims

788
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,740
when so much of it hinges on the generally uninteresting private lives of a few characters.

789
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:19,740
Not so much. I wouldn't fault anyone for liking it, but I do agree with criticisms

790
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,580
that the essence of Foundation turned mildly mushy somewhere along the way.

791
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:28,700
Could this have been predicted? Was there any sign that we should have seen this coming?

792
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:35,020
If ever there were a company that was hoping to sort of better people's lives through technology,

793
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:39,740
through connectivity, it's Apple, and that's something very much that Asimov was hoping to do.

794
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:46,700
Truly a mystery of the universe. Nah, but really this was probably inevitable,

795
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:51,100
and Asimov's as much to blame as anyone. A century-hopping thought piece on the

796
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:56,060
maths of history is a hard story to tell in any medium. We're too wedded to predictable

797
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:01,020
structures of fiction for it to be easy. But we're also too wedded to the volatility of

798
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:05,900
fiction to accept a story that predicts its own cause. So how does Foundation avoid that?

799
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:12,140
This isn't a hollow question. John Campbell asked the same one after Asimov's first few

800
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,260
Foundation stories, fearing the premise was getting stale. He ordered Asimov to disrupt

801
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:22,620
the seldom plan, and Asimov gave him the mule. Asimov eventually grew to view Foundation as

802
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:27,980
another writing challenge, attacking the premise from all sides. Given a plan based on iron laws

803
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:34,460
of history, how could it still go wrong? What holes would go unnoticed? And this is really the

804
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:40,380
value of science fiction. It explores questions science can't yet answer, but one day might have

805
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:46,460
to. Fiction gives us incredible power to speculate and wonder, and Asimov more than most knew how

806
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:51,500
to wield it. Foundation stands as a towering achievement in appreciating both the maths of

807
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,060
history and, through the many who were inspired by the story it tells, the myth of history too.

808
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:01,180
If historians' responses to cleodynamics have taught me anything, it's that we're at our best

809
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:06,940
when we strive to understand them together. Mathematics is a tool more powerful than any other,

810
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:11,580
but if we don't appreciate the human context when applying it, it won't get us anywhere.

811
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:21,740
Personally, I'm content to believe that both our lives and our fiction remain unpredictable,

812
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:25,900
because that way, we never know what wonders lie in store for us in the future.

813
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:37,260
Ah, Jesus, why? Was that even funny? Well, this is what's become of my attempts at

814
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:43,660
comedy now? Jesus Christ, it's not funny, it just hurts. Every time I try to make something new

815
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:48,540
and original and I just revert to the same tired formulas over and over again.

816
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:55,820
Hmm, well, I am putting my foot down. This video will not be derailed like all the others,

817
01:00:55,820 --> 01:01:00,700
you hear me? I will break the eternal and depressive mould. No more of this format.

818
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:04,700
No longer will we cower in fear of sudden, non-secretarial disaster.

819
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,740
I forgot about a cannonball.

820
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:15,660
Hey, so does anyone remember when you didn't know what this video was about?

821
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:20,940
Ah, those were the days. I said that someone had guessed the topic correctly in my 10,000

822
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,820
subscribers Q&A and turned it into something intensely meta, and I had a lot of fun with that.

823
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,660
Everyone at my Discord thought it would be Leviathan. I've never read Leviathan. Sorry.

824
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,540
But yeah, Discord, I have one. Joined for updates on and discussions about my videos,

825
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:38,860
along with many other things. See you there.

826
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:47,660
Thank you very much for watching, everybody. This video began as a love letter to Foundation

827
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:51,260
and seems to have ended as a love letter to maths, which sounds good to me.

828
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:56,620
Either way, that was a lot of work. You can find all my research sources in the description,

829
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:01,180
and I have to give particular credit to Marcus DeSotois, as I may have cribbed a disproportionate

830
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:06,380
amount of the maths in this video from his books and TV programs. Anyway, hope you enjoyed this

831
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:11,580
video and learned something from it. Stay tuned for whatever comes next. Maybe now you'll know

832
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:14,860
how to predict it. Goodbye.

833
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:45,980
Is an apple orchard in the imperial gardens that's older than the robot wars?
