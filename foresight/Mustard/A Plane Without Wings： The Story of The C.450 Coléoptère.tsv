11440	19320	In the 1950s, the French set aside conventional aircraft building wisdom to design a plane
19320	22960	unlike anything recognizable today.
22960	28240	With a cylindrical wing, plans for ramjet propulsion and the ability to take off and
28240	34160	land vertically on its tail, this plane would lay the foundation for a new way to protect
34160	40240	French airspace, with planes that could take off from anywhere, rising up to meet the enemy
40240	50000	like a swarm of angry bees.
50000	55320	Conventional airplanes need runways to get airborne, accelerating until their wings generate
55320	57760	enough lift to take off.
57760	62200	One way to reduce the length of runway needed is to give the plane more power so that it
62200	65840	can get up to speed faster and lift off earlier.
65840	71680	But in the 1950s, aircraft designers realized that with enough power, planes might not need
71680	73200	runways at all.
73200	78960	Instead of powering down a runway, they could instead be oriented towards the sky and use
78960	84240	engine power alone to lift off and accelerate until their wings generate lift.
84240	89360	The advent of more powerful engines gave rise to a new category of experimental aircraft
89360	95280	called tail-sitters, a configuration that could potentially revolutionize air forces.
95280	100000	In any conflict, runways were going to be the first targets and their destruction could
100000	105520	render entire air forces inoperable, but tail-sitting planes wouldn't need runways.
105520	109840	They could instead be hidden or deployed to defend vulnerable targets.
109840	114840	If engineers could get the configuration to work, tail-sitting planes promised to fundamentally
114840	121560	change how and where aircraft could be used.
121560	127660	In 1954, a French aerospace firm renowned for aircraft engines began developing wingless
127660	132240	test rigs to prove the feasibility of the tail-sitting concept.
132240	137040	Getting a tail-sitting plane to work would require more than just powerful engines.
137040	142120	Entirely new control systems were needed to make vertical takeoff and landings possible.
142120	146600	It was a daunting engineering challenge for the time, but the French weren't the only
146600	148480	ones pursuing the idea.
148480	153520	The Americans had also developed tail-sitting prototypes, and with each plane they experimented
153520	158640	with a different combination of propulsion, wing configuration, and flight control.
158640	162000	But the French had something a little more radical in mind.
162000	167160	The C450 Collie-Auptaire would barely even resemble an airplane, because its powerful
167160	172880	turbojet engine would be surrounded by a 10.5 foot diameter cylindrical wing.
172880	179200	The highly unconventional wing promised greater efficiency by reducing wasteful wingtip fortices,
179200	183840	which occur on conventional wings, and its compact shape would reduce the amount of space
183840	186280	needed for takeoff and landings.
186280	191240	But the French also theorized that the radical wing could eventually be engineered to function
191240	196960	as a ramjet, compressing incoming air, mixing it with fuel, and igniting it to power the
196960	200520	plane to supersonic speeds beyond Mach 2.
200520	205360	The wing would be a radical combination of lifting device, airframe, and propulsion all
205360	206360	in one.
206360	211360	To control the aircraft during takeoff and landings, thrust would be vectored using deflecting
211360	213760	vanes in the engine's exhaust.
213760	218800	During conventional forward flight, triangular winglets would provide directional control.
218800	223520	And to help transition back to horizontal flight, small retractable fins would deploy
223520	225760	on the fuselage nose.
225760	228840	But landing the Collie-Auptaire would be challenging.
228840	232720	With the pilots back to the ground, they'd have to look over their shoulder.
232720	237840	So designers innovated a cockpit with a seat that could swivel 90 degrees, to remain upright
237840	240640	regardless of the aircraft's orientation.
240640	245560	The Collie-Auptaire would look straight out of science fiction, but as an aircraft designed
245560	251400	in the 1950s, long before computer simulations, daring test pilots would have to play just
251400	259280	as much of a role as engineers in getting it to work.
259280	265880	The Collie-Auptaire began flight testing in April of 1959, first undergoing tethered evaluation
265880	268360	before progressing to free flight.
268360	273320	By May, the plane had proven its ability to hover for minutes on end, and had even flown
273320	276200	up to an altitude of 800 meters.
276200	280500	The radical machine made waves throughout France and around the world.
280500	285000	The Americans who had keenly followed the progress of the French from the very beginning
285000	289740	reached out to aerospace firms to study cylindrical wings for themselves.
289740	294320	But as with most novel designs, flaws soon emerged.
294320	298800	Without the benefit of a conventional wing to counter rolling tendencies, the Collie-Auptaire
298800	304040	slowly spun on its axis during hover, making control extremely difficult.
304040	309040	And perched high on top of a vertically oriented plane, pilots struggled to judge just how
309040	314120	far the aircraft was from the ground, and in an emergency conventional planes could still
314120	319560	land without engine power, unlike the Collie-Auptaire which would always need its engine to land
319560	320560	safely.
320560	325400	But the French pressed on, confident that they could sort out the prototype's flaws.
325400	331280	By July of 1959, engineers were ready to tackle the more challenging procedure of transitioning
331280	334440	from vertical to conventional forward flight.
334440	337320	It would be a pivotal moment for the program.
337320	342400	On July 25th, the Collie-Auptaire lifted off vertically, but during its transition it suddenly
342400	346360	became too inclined and slow moving to maintain altitude.
346360	351760	The plane started tumbling back to Earth, and the pilots struggled to regain control,
351760	354720	only barely managing to eject in time.
354720	360480	In an instant, the prototype was destroyed, and development suddenly ground to a halt.
360480	365240	To continue, the program would need to secure additional funding to build a second prototype.
365240	370480	But the funding would never materialize, because the Collie-Auptaire would be the last major
370480	373840	effort at building a piloted tail-sitting plane.
373840	378360	By 1960, the Americans had abandoned development of their own tail-sitters.
378360	383120	The configuration was a dead end, simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload
383120	386400	and range, and far too dangerous to pilot.
386400	391000	And as it turns out, directing engine exhaust to lift the aircraft instead of tilting an
391000	395480	entire aircraft was a more practical and safer solution.
395480	400160	The Collie-Auptaire's cylindrical wing also proved to be an elusive concept.
400160	404800	With less induced drag, it was in theory more efficient than a conventional wing.
404800	410120	But in practice, parasitic drag from the wing structure largely canceled out benefits,
410120	417920	and introduced a host of other aerodynamic challenges.
417920	423440	Setting aside conventional aircraft building wisdom often results in dead ends.
423440	426640	But every so often, it leads to a breakthrough.
426640	430400	In a few weeks, I'll be releasing my second Nebula original.
430400	434680	This time about a plane that for years was America's best kept secret.
434680	440480	A plane so revolutionary, it fundamentally changed military aircraft design.
440480	446400	I'll be releasing it on Nebula because covering military topics on YouTube is just too risky.
