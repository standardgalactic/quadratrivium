3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:19,320
In the 1950s, the French set aside conventional aircraft building wisdom to design a plane

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,960
unlike anything recognizable today.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,240
With a cylindrical wing, plans for ramjet propulsion and the ability to take off and

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,160
land vertically on its tail, this plane would lay the foundation for a new way to protect

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,240
French airspace, with planes that could take off from anywhere, rising up to meet the enemy

8
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:50,000
like a swarm of angry bees.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,320
Conventional airplanes need runways to get airborne, accelerating until their wings generate

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,760
enough lift to take off.

11
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,200
One way to reduce the length of runway needed is to give the plane more power so that it

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,840
can get up to speed faster and lift off earlier.

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,680
But in the 1950s, aircraft designers realized that with enough power, planes might not need

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,200
runways at all.

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,960
Instead of powering down a runway, they could instead be oriented towards the sky and use

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,240
engine power alone to lift off and accelerate until their wings generate lift.

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,360
The advent of more powerful engines gave rise to a new category of experimental aircraft

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,280
called tail-sitters, a configuration that could potentially revolutionize air forces.

19
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,000
In any conflict, runways were going to be the first targets and their destruction could

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,520
render entire air forces inoperable, but tail-sitting planes wouldn't need runways.

21
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,840
They could instead be hidden or deployed to defend vulnerable targets.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,840
If engineers could get the configuration to work, tail-sitting planes promised to fundamentally

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:01,560
change how and where aircraft could be used.

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,660
In 1954, a French aerospace firm renowned for aircraft engines began developing wingless

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,240
test rigs to prove the feasibility of the tail-sitting concept.

26
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,040
Getting a tail-sitting plane to work would require more than just powerful engines.

27
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,120
Entirely new control systems were needed to make vertical takeoff and landings possible.

28
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,600
It was a daunting engineering challenge for the time, but the French weren't the only

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,480
ones pursuing the idea.

30
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,520
The Americans had also developed tail-sitting prototypes, and with each plane they experimented

31
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,640
with a different combination of propulsion, wing configuration, and flight control.

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
But the French had something a little more radical in mind.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,160
The C450 Collie-Auptaire would barely even resemble an airplane, because its powerful

34
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,880
turbojet engine would be surrounded by a 10.5 foot diameter cylindrical wing.

35
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,200
The highly unconventional wing promised greater efficiency by reducing wasteful wingtip fortices,

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,840
which occur on conventional wings, and its compact shape would reduce the amount of space

37
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,280
needed for takeoff and landings.

38
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,240
But the French also theorized that the radical wing could eventually be engineered to function

39
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,960
as a ramjet, compressing incoming air, mixing it with fuel, and igniting it to power the

40
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,520
plane to supersonic speeds beyond Mach 2.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,360
The wing would be a radical combination of lifting device, airframe, and propulsion all

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
in one.

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,360
To control the aircraft during takeoff and landings, thrust would be vectored using deflecting

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
vanes in the engine's exhaust.

45
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,800
During conventional forward flight, triangular winglets would provide directional control.

46
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,520
And to help transition back to horizontal flight, small retractable fins would deploy

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,760
on the fuselage nose.

48
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,840
But landing the Collie-Auptaire would be challenging.

49
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,720
With the pilots back to the ground, they'd have to look over their shoulder.

50
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,840
So designers innovated a cockpit with a seat that could swivel 90 degrees, to remain upright

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,640
regardless of the aircraft's orientation.

52
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,560
The Collie-Auptaire would look straight out of science fiction, but as an aircraft designed

53
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,400
in the 1950s, long before computer simulations, daring test pilots would have to play just

54
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,280
as much of a role as engineers in getting it to work.

55
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,880
The Collie-Auptaire began flight testing in April of 1959, first undergoing tethered evaluation

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,360
before progressing to free flight.

57
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,320
By May, the plane had proven its ability to hover for minutes on end, and had even flown

58
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,200
up to an altitude of 800 meters.

59
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,500
The radical machine made waves throughout France and around the world.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,000
The Americans who had keenly followed the progress of the French from the very beginning

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,740
reached out to aerospace firms to study cylindrical wings for themselves.

62
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,320
But as with most novel designs, flaws soon emerged.

63
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,800
Without the benefit of a conventional wing to counter rolling tendencies, the Collie-Auptaire

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,040
slowly spun on its axis during hover, making control extremely difficult.

65
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:09,040
And perched high on top of a vertically oriented plane, pilots struggled to judge just how

66
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:14,120
far the aircraft was from the ground, and in an emergency conventional planes could still

67
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,560
land without engine power, unlike the Collie-Auptaire which would always need its engine to land

68
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
safely.

69
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,400
But the French pressed on, confident that they could sort out the prototype's flaws.

70
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:31,280
By July of 1959, engineers were ready to tackle the more challenging procedure of transitioning

71
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,440
from vertical to conventional forward flight.

72
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,320
It would be a pivotal moment for the program.

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,400
On July 25th, the Collie-Auptaire lifted off vertically, but during its transition it suddenly

74
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,360
became too inclined and slow moving to maintain altitude.

75
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,760
The plane started tumbling back to Earth, and the pilots struggled to regain control,

76
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,720
only barely managing to eject in time.

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,480
In an instant, the prototype was destroyed, and development suddenly ground to a halt.

78
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:05,240
To continue, the program would need to secure additional funding to build a second prototype.

79
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,480
But the funding would never materialize, because the Collie-Auptaire would be the last major

80
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,840
effort at building a piloted tail-sitting plane.

81
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,360
By 1960, the Americans had abandoned development of their own tail-sitters.

82
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,120
The configuration was a dead end, simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload

83
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,400
and range, and far too dangerous to pilot.

84
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,000
And as it turns out, directing engine exhaust to lift the aircraft instead of tilting an

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,480
entire aircraft was a more practical and safer solution.

86
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,160
The Collie-Auptaire's cylindrical wing also proved to be an elusive concept.

87
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,800
With less induced drag, it was in theory more efficient than a conventional wing.

88
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,120
But in practice, parasitic drag from the wing structure largely canceled out benefits,

89
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,920
and introduced a host of other aerodynamic challenges.

90
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,440
Setting aside conventional aircraft building wisdom often results in dead ends.

91
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,640
But every so often, it leads to a breakthrough.

92
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,400
In a few weeks, I'll be releasing my second Nebula original.

93
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,680
This time about a plane that for years was America's best kept secret.

94
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,480
A plane so revolutionary, it fundamentally changed military aircraft design.

95
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:26,400
I'll be releasing it on Nebula because covering military topics on YouTube is just too risky.

96
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,600
Too often, educational content is needlessly demonetized.

97
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,160
But with Nebula, I'm free to make the content I want to create.

98
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,320
