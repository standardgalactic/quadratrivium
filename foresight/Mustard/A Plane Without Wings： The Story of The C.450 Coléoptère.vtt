00:11.440 --> 00:19.320
In the 1950s, the French set aside conventional aircraft building wisdom to design a plane

00:19.320 --> 00:22.960
unlike anything recognizable today.

00:22.960 --> 00:28.240
With a cylindrical wing, plans for ramjet propulsion and the ability to take off and

00:28.240 --> 00:34.160
land vertically on its tail, this plane would lay the foundation for a new way to protect

00:34.160 --> 00:40.240
French airspace, with planes that could take off from anywhere, rising up to meet the enemy

00:40.240 --> 00:50.000
like a swarm of angry bees.

00:50.000 --> 00:55.320
Conventional airplanes need runways to get airborne, accelerating until their wings generate

00:55.320 --> 00:57.760
enough lift to take off.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.200
One way to reduce the length of runway needed is to give the plane more power so that it

01:02.200 --> 01:05.840
can get up to speed faster and lift off earlier.

01:05.840 --> 01:11.680
But in the 1950s, aircraft designers realized that with enough power, planes might not need

01:11.680 --> 01:13.200
runways at all.

01:13.200 --> 01:18.960
Instead of powering down a runway, they could instead be oriented towards the sky and use

01:18.960 --> 01:24.240
engine power alone to lift off and accelerate until their wings generate lift.

01:24.240 --> 01:29.360
The advent of more powerful engines gave rise to a new category of experimental aircraft

01:29.360 --> 01:35.280
called tail-sitters, a configuration that could potentially revolutionize air forces.

01:35.280 --> 01:40.000
In any conflict, runways were going to be the first targets and their destruction could

01:40.000 --> 01:45.520
render entire air forces inoperable, but tail-sitting planes wouldn't need runways.

01:45.520 --> 01:49.840
They could instead be hidden or deployed to defend vulnerable targets.

01:49.840 --> 01:54.840
If engineers could get the configuration to work, tail-sitting planes promised to fundamentally

01:54.840 --> 02:01.560
change how and where aircraft could be used.

02:01.560 --> 02:07.660
In 1954, a French aerospace firm renowned for aircraft engines began developing wingless

02:07.660 --> 02:12.240
test rigs to prove the feasibility of the tail-sitting concept.

02:12.240 --> 02:17.040
Getting a tail-sitting plane to work would require more than just powerful engines.

02:17.040 --> 02:22.120
Entirely new control systems were needed to make vertical takeoff and landings possible.

02:22.120 --> 02:26.600
It was a daunting engineering challenge for the time, but the French weren't the only

02:26.600 --> 02:28.480
ones pursuing the idea.

02:28.480 --> 02:33.520
The Americans had also developed tail-sitting prototypes, and with each plane they experimented

02:33.520 --> 02:38.640
with a different combination of propulsion, wing configuration, and flight control.

02:38.640 --> 02:42.000
But the French had something a little more radical in mind.

02:42.000 --> 02:47.160
The C450 Collie-Auptaire would barely even resemble an airplane, because its powerful

02:47.160 --> 02:52.880
turbojet engine would be surrounded by a 10.5 foot diameter cylindrical wing.

02:52.880 --> 02:59.200
The highly unconventional wing promised greater efficiency by reducing wasteful wingtip fortices,

02:59.200 --> 03:03.840
which occur on conventional wings, and its compact shape would reduce the amount of space

03:03.840 --> 03:06.280
needed for takeoff and landings.

03:06.280 --> 03:11.240
But the French also theorized that the radical wing could eventually be engineered to function

03:11.240 --> 03:16.960
as a ramjet, compressing incoming air, mixing it with fuel, and igniting it to power the

03:16.960 --> 03:20.520
plane to supersonic speeds beyond Mach 2.

03:20.520 --> 03:25.360
The wing would be a radical combination of lifting device, airframe, and propulsion all

03:25.360 --> 03:26.360
in one.

03:26.360 --> 03:31.360
To control the aircraft during takeoff and landings, thrust would be vectored using deflecting

03:31.360 --> 03:33.760
vanes in the engine's exhaust.

03:33.760 --> 03:38.800
During conventional forward flight, triangular winglets would provide directional control.

03:38.800 --> 03:43.520
And to help transition back to horizontal flight, small retractable fins would deploy

03:43.520 --> 03:45.760
on the fuselage nose.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.840
But landing the Collie-Auptaire would be challenging.

03:48.840 --> 03:52.720
With the pilots back to the ground, they'd have to look over their shoulder.

03:52.720 --> 03:57.840
So designers innovated a cockpit with a seat that could swivel 90 degrees, to remain upright

03:57.840 --> 04:00.640
regardless of the aircraft's orientation.

04:00.640 --> 04:05.560
The Collie-Auptaire would look straight out of science fiction, but as an aircraft designed

04:05.560 --> 04:11.400
in the 1950s, long before computer simulations, daring test pilots would have to play just

04:11.400 --> 04:19.280
as much of a role as engineers in getting it to work.

04:19.280 --> 04:25.880
The Collie-Auptaire began flight testing in April of 1959, first undergoing tethered evaluation

04:25.880 --> 04:28.360
before progressing to free flight.

04:28.360 --> 04:33.320
By May, the plane had proven its ability to hover for minutes on end, and had even flown

04:33.320 --> 04:36.200
up to an altitude of 800 meters.

04:36.200 --> 04:40.500
The radical machine made waves throughout France and around the world.

04:40.500 --> 04:45.000
The Americans who had keenly followed the progress of the French from the very beginning

04:45.000 --> 04:49.740
reached out to aerospace firms to study cylindrical wings for themselves.

04:49.740 --> 04:54.320
But as with most novel designs, flaws soon emerged.

04:54.320 --> 04:58.800
Without the benefit of a conventional wing to counter rolling tendencies, the Collie-Auptaire

04:58.800 --> 05:04.040
slowly spun on its axis during hover, making control extremely difficult.

05:04.040 --> 05:09.040
And perched high on top of a vertically oriented plane, pilots struggled to judge just how

05:09.040 --> 05:14.120
far the aircraft was from the ground, and in an emergency conventional planes could still

05:14.120 --> 05:19.560
land without engine power, unlike the Collie-Auptaire which would always need its engine to land

05:19.560 --> 05:20.560
safely.

05:20.560 --> 05:25.400
But the French pressed on, confident that they could sort out the prototype's flaws.

05:25.400 --> 05:31.280
By July of 1959, engineers were ready to tackle the more challenging procedure of transitioning

05:31.280 --> 05:34.440
from vertical to conventional forward flight.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.320
It would be a pivotal moment for the program.

05:37.320 --> 05:42.400
On July 25th, the Collie-Auptaire lifted off vertically, but during its transition it suddenly

05:42.400 --> 05:46.360
became too inclined and slow moving to maintain altitude.

05:46.360 --> 05:51.760
The plane started tumbling back to Earth, and the pilots struggled to regain control,

05:51.760 --> 05:54.720
only barely managing to eject in time.

05:54.720 --> 06:00.480
In an instant, the prototype was destroyed, and development suddenly ground to a halt.

06:00.480 --> 06:05.240
To continue, the program would need to secure additional funding to build a second prototype.

06:05.240 --> 06:10.480
But the funding would never materialize, because the Collie-Auptaire would be the last major

06:10.480 --> 06:13.840
effort at building a piloted tail-sitting plane.

06:13.840 --> 06:18.360
By 1960, the Americans had abandoned development of their own tail-sitters.

06:18.360 --> 06:23.120
The configuration was a dead end, simply too much of a compromise when it came to payload

06:23.120 --> 06:26.400
and range, and far too dangerous to pilot.

06:26.400 --> 06:31.000
And as it turns out, directing engine exhaust to lift the aircraft instead of tilting an

06:31.000 --> 06:35.480
entire aircraft was a more practical and safer solution.

06:35.480 --> 06:40.160
The Collie-Auptaire's cylindrical wing also proved to be an elusive concept.

06:40.160 --> 06:44.800
With less induced drag, it was in theory more efficient than a conventional wing.

06:44.800 --> 06:50.120
But in practice, parasitic drag from the wing structure largely canceled out benefits,

06:50.120 --> 06:57.920
and introduced a host of other aerodynamic challenges.

06:57.920 --> 07:03.440
Setting aside conventional aircraft building wisdom often results in dead ends.

07:03.440 --> 07:06.640
But every so often, it leads to a breakthrough.

07:06.640 --> 07:10.400
In a few weeks, I'll be releasing my second Nebula original.

07:10.400 --> 07:14.680
This time about a plane that for years was America's best kept secret.

07:14.680 --> 07:20.480
A plane so revolutionary, it fundamentally changed military aircraft design.

07:20.480 --> 07:26.400
I'll be releasing it on Nebula because covering military topics on YouTube is just too risky.

07:26.400 --> 07:30.600
Too often, educational content is needlessly demonetized.

07:30.600 --> 07:34.160
