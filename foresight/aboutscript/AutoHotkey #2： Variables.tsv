0	5120	Hello, this is Frankie and we're making another tutorial.
5120	10720	We're going to go in-depth into AutoHotKey, I've been using it for a while and I think
10720	17120	I know my way around, so this is going to be a fairly long series of tutorials that you
17120	23760	can pick and choose what you want to learn and I'll post about how I think it should
23760	29320	be used on my blog probably after I finish this video.
29320	36440	So what we're going to do today is we're going to start with variables and in programming
36440	41920	variables are, they're essential, it's like the main, it's probably the most important
41920	47960	part of programming is having things that you can update and change and look at and
47960	52800	do all sorts of things with so that it's not just you just do something and then it's
52800	55280	as if it never happened, alright?
55280	62200	So we're going to make a very simple variable, we're going to call it my there and then we're
62200	67880	going to use an assignment operator, this is the expression assignment operator, we'll
67880	73280	cover that in maybe like five or six tutorials for now, okay?
73280	83520	And we're going to put my string and whenever you type a string in AutoHotKey, well most
83600	89320	of the time, but that's a little past this tutorial, you put it in double quotes as if
89320	91920	you were quoting someone saying something.
91920	98720	So if I said, that guy said my string, well I'm quoting that string and then it goes
98720	103560	from here into this variable, okay?
103560	107360	And if you watch the tutorial before this, which was the really basic one, the Hello
107360	116880	World tutorial, we showed how we could do a message box and have it say Hello World,
116880	122600	but instead of saying Hello World, we're going to have it say whatever we put in my there,
122600	123600	okay?
123600	134000	So the way we do that in a message box, so type my there in percentage signs and when
134000	140160	we run this, what it should do is it should say my string in a little message box that
140160	141600	pops up, okay?
141600	148960	So we're going to click run and you see now we have my string in a message box, but it's
148960	154120	not on the same line, it doesn't say my string anywhere on this line, we could actually put
154120	159760	a bunch of other stuff in here, we could put a equals, I don't know, whatever.
159760	165320	And even though my string was defined up here, we can still access it somewhere else
165320	171720	in our script, okay?
171720	178760	And there's two types of things that you can put in variables, you can put string, well
178760	185760	three types, there's strings and there's numbers, we could have the number five and then we
185760	201840	could have another variable, v2 equals my there plus five and if we check v2 down here,
201840	203440	see it says ten.
203440	208480	So you can do all sorts of things with variables, you can do math and store it for later use
208480	212080	and really whatever you need to do.
212080	217040	The only other thing that variables can store is objects, but that's going to be in either
217040	221640	the intermediate or the advanced section of these tutorials.
221640	227360	So now you can play around with this a little bit, you may run into some problems because
227360	233640	the stuff is confusing when you first learn it, but just try making assigning variables
233640	240600	and then displaying them in a message box as you see here and I'll post this code exactly
240600	245200	as it is on the blog in case you want to use it as a reference.
245200	245640	Thank you.
