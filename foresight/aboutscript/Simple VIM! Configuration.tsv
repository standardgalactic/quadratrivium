0	4240	This is Frankie and in this video we are going to talk about configuring Vim.
4880	11120	So just like the previous video, if you haven't seen it, nothing crazy, nothing complicated,
11120	18640	just the stuff that you need to be somewhat productive in Vim. Okay, so this is my Vim
18640	27360	RC, which goes in your home directory. It's slash dot Vim RC. You can just edit it. It should
27360	33280	already exist if you have Vim installed. So we'll just go over this one line at a time.
34880	41280	Set tab stop for, set shift width for, set expand tab. So we're just going to look at these three
41280	48960	first. This means by default indent with four spaces and when I press the tab key I want you to use
48960	57280	spaces. The ruler is, I believe it just displays a ruler and we want everything to be saved as you
57280	64320	TF8 by default. Great. So now what we have down here, I don't actually know what auto CMD file type
64320	72320	means. All I know is that when the file type is YAML or YML, I want you to use two spaces and
73440	80160	when it's fish or make, I want you to not, when I press tab, actually insert a tab.
81040	84800	It is important in make and it's just what people do in fish.
87280	92720	So then down here we get into a little bit of complicated stuff that I copied and pasted
93600	103520	from here to here. So what this does is it trims white spaces at the end of line.
104880	110720	I don't know. I guess there's no way, no button for this in Vim by default. Okay. So trim white spaces
111280	118000	and then when I press F2 it calls trim white space and it gets rid of white spaces at the
118000	125760	end of lines. So I can just go down here add some white space at the end of the line and then press
125760	134560	F2 and it gets rid of it. Pretty self-explanatory. And then what this does here is it displays,
134560	138720	you saw those characters when there's, when you have just like random white space hanging around
138720	144720	at the end of lines, it just lets you know, so you know you have to clear it. That's, that's all that
144720	152000	does. And here's the most complicated thing. I actually wrote this myself. So what it does is
152000	158400	it's a function called toggle with and it checks if the shift width is four and if it is it sets it
158400	164880	to two and then it displays a little thing at the bottom. I'm going to press this set indent to two,
164880	169680	set indent to four, so it just toggles back and forth between them based on whatever the
169680	177360	current shift width is. So if I'm in a file and it's using two indents or I want to use two indents,
177920	184800	I just hit F3 and then it'll use two indents for everything. And down here I just bind it to F3.
185920	190720	Now this is the important part. We're using pathogen, which is the easiest way to install
190720	197200	plugins for Vim and Vim is very light by default. It doesn't have a lot of the useful things you
197200	204720	want. So you need a way to have plugins installed. So we're just going to pop over to Chrome and see
204720	212960	what pathogen is. So it's just a thing and you just run the command and it installs and then you
212960	220560	just put the stuff in your Vim RC, fairly straightforward. And then when you want to
220560	224400	install a plugin, like let's say we want to install Vim Go, which I don't have installed currently,
225120	232080	you just google you know Vim Go because you want to use Go in Vim and then you scroll down
233520	238800	and you see install and then it tells you how to install it with pathogen and you copy
239040	250560	and you paste and it will install Vim Go and it's done. So in your home directory
251200	257680	slash dot Vim is where all this stuff is. So you see you have the pathogen plugin thing here,
257680	262800	which is automatically loaded. And then you have your other plugins, including Vim Go,
262800	273120	which we just installed. So these plugins are anything varying from just here's how you should
273120	280240	highlight this to this Go one, which looks very complicated from this picture here. It looks
280240	284560	like it has a lot of crazy stuff in it. So that's going to be significantly different.
285520	291360	Um, let's see. All of these things for the most part are syntax highlighting
292480	296320	and editor config, which doesn't even work. I don't even know. I should probably just get
296320	303760	rid of that. And you complete me is just, it's just like a general file completion,
303760	309440	like probably if I were to type toggle, yeah, it just like pops up. There's nothing like this
309440	315760	by default in Vim. And I just wanted something that more or less works. So that's just my generic
315760	320960	file completion. It works in especially things that are seed like, it'll actually look across
320960	327120	multiple files in the directory and find things that you probably meant to type there. So it's
327120	335120	cool. And that's it. That's literally everything. A lot of people have like 5000 line VAMRCs and
335200	341840	it's just crazy, but this is all I need at least. I hope this helped you and I hope you can use this
341840	346960	and not too much more to have them working for you. I'll see you in the next video.
