00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,240
This is Frankie and in this video we are going to talk about configuring Vim.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,120
So just like the previous video, if you haven't seen it, nothing crazy, nothing complicated,

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,640
just the stuff that you need to be somewhat productive in Vim. Okay, so this is my Vim

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:27,360
RC, which goes in your home directory. It's slash dot Vim RC. You can just edit it. It should

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:33,280
already exist if you have Vim installed. So we'll just go over this one line at a time.

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,280
Set tab stop for, set shift width for, set expand tab. So we're just going to look at these three

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,960
first. This means by default indent with four spaces and when I press the tab key I want you to use

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,280
spaces. The ruler is, I believe it just displays a ruler and we want everything to be saved as you

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,320
TF8 by default. Great. So now what we have down here, I don't actually know what auto CMD file type

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:12,320
means. All I know is that when the file type is YAML or YML, I want you to use two spaces and

11
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,160
when it's fish or make, I want you to not, when I press tab, actually insert a tab.

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,800
It is important in make and it's just what people do in fish.

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,720
So then down here we get into a little bit of complicated stuff that I copied and pasted

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:43,520
from here to here. So what this does is it trims white spaces at the end of line.

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,720
I don't know. I guess there's no way, no button for this in Vim by default. Okay. So trim white spaces

16
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:58,000
and then when I press F2 it calls trim white space and it gets rid of white spaces at the

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,760
end of lines. So I can just go down here add some white space at the end of the line and then press

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:14,560
F2 and it gets rid of it. Pretty self-explanatory. And then what this does here is it displays,

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
you saw those characters when there's, when you have just like random white space hanging around

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,720
at the end of lines, it just lets you know, so you know you have to clear it. That's, that's all that

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,000
does. And here's the most complicated thing. I actually wrote this myself. So what it does is

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,400
it's a function called toggle with and it checks if the shift width is four and if it is it sets it

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,880
to two and then it displays a little thing at the bottom. I'm going to press this set indent to two,

24
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,680
set indent to four, so it just toggles back and forth between them based on whatever the

25
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,360
current shift width is. So if I'm in a file and it's using two indents or I want to use two indents,

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,800
I just hit F3 and then it'll use two indents for everything. And down here I just bind it to F3.

27
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,720
Now this is the important part. We're using pathogen, which is the easiest way to install

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:17,200
plugins for Vim and Vim is very light by default. It doesn't have a lot of the useful things you

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,720
want. So you need a way to have plugins installed. So we're just going to pop over to Chrome and see

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,960
what pathogen is. So it's just a thing and you just run the command and it installs and then you

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:40,560
just put the stuff in your Vim RC, fairly straightforward. And then when you want to

32
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
install a plugin, like let's say we want to install Vim Go, which I don't have installed currently,

33
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,080
you just google you know Vim Go because you want to use Go in Vim and then you scroll down

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,800
and you see install and then it tells you how to install it with pathogen and you copy

35
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:10,560
and you paste and it will install Vim Go and it's done. So in your home directory

36
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,680
slash dot Vim is where all this stuff is. So you see you have the pathogen plugin thing here,

37
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,800
which is automatically loaded. And then you have your other plugins, including Vim Go,

38
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:33,120
which we just installed. So these plugins are anything varying from just here's how you should

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,240
highlight this to this Go one, which looks very complicated from this picture here. It looks

40
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,560
like it has a lot of crazy stuff in it. So that's going to be significantly different.

41
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,360
Um, let's see. All of these things for the most part are syntax highlighting

42
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,320
and editor config, which doesn't even work. I don't even know. I should probably just get

43
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,760
rid of that. And you complete me is just, it's just like a general file completion,

44
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:09,440
like probably if I were to type toggle, yeah, it just like pops up. There's nothing like this

45
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,760
by default in Vim. And I just wanted something that more or less works. So that's just my generic

46
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,960
file completion. It works in especially things that are seed like, it'll actually look across

47
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,120
multiple files in the directory and find things that you probably meant to type there. So it's

48
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:35,120
cool. And that's it. That's literally everything. A lot of people have like 5000 line VAMRCs and

49
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,840
it's just crazy, but this is all I need at least. I hope this helped you and I hope you can use this

50
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,960
and not too much more to have them working for you. I'll see you in the next video.
