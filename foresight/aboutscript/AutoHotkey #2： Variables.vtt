Hello, this is Frankie and we're making another tutorial.

00:05.120 --> 00:10.720
We're going to go in-depth into AutoHotKey, I've been using it for a while and I think

00:10.720 --> 00:17.120
I know my way around, so this is going to be a fairly long series of tutorials that you

00:17.120 --> 00:23.760
can pick and choose what you want to learn and I'll post about how I think it should

00:23.760 --> 00:29.320
be used on my blog probably after I finish this video.

00:29.320 --> 00:36.440
So what we're going to do today is we're going to start with variables and in programming

00:36.440 --> 00:41.920
variables are, they're essential, it's like the main, it's probably the most important

00:41.920 --> 00:47.960
part of programming is having things that you can update and change and look at and

00:47.960 --> 00:52.800
do all sorts of things with so that it's not just you just do something and then it's

00:52.800 --> 00:55.280
as if it never happened, alright?

00:55.280 --> 01:02.200
So we're going to make a very simple variable, we're going to call it my there and then we're

01:02.200 --> 01:07.880
going to use an assignment operator, this is the expression assignment operator, we'll

01:07.880 --> 01:13.280
cover that in maybe like five or six tutorials for now, okay?

01:13.280 --> 01:23.520
And we're going to put my string and whenever you type a string in AutoHotKey, well most

01:23.600 --> 01:29.320
of the time, but that's a little past this tutorial, you put it in double quotes as if

01:29.320 --> 01:31.920
you were quoting someone saying something.

01:31.920 --> 01:38.720
So if I said, that guy said my string, well I'm quoting that string and then it goes

01:38.720 --> 01:43.560
from here into this variable, okay?

01:43.560 --> 01:47.360
And if you watch the tutorial before this, which was the really basic one, the Hello

01:47.360 --> 01:56.880
World tutorial, we showed how we could do a message box and have it say Hello World,

01:56.880 --> 02:02.600
but instead of saying Hello World, we're going to have it say whatever we put in my there,

02:02.600 --> 02:03.600
okay?

02:03.600 --> 02:14.000
So the way we do that in a message box, so type my there in percentage signs and when

02:14.000 --> 02:20.160
we run this, what it should do is it should say my string in a little message box that

02:20.160 --> 02:21.600
pops up, okay?

02:21.600 --> 02:28.960
So we're going to click run and you see now we have my string in a message box, but it's

02:28.960 --> 02:34.120
not on the same line, it doesn't say my string anywhere on this line, we could actually put

02:34.120 --> 02:39.760
a bunch of other stuff in here, we could put a equals, I don't know, whatever.

02:39.760 --> 02:45.320
And even though my string was defined up here, we can still access it somewhere else

02:45.320 --> 02:51.720
in our script, okay?

02:51.720 --> 02:58.760
And there's two types of things that you can put in variables, you can put string, well

02:58.760 --> 03:05.760
three types, there's strings and there's numbers, we could have the number five and then we

03:05.760 --> 03:21.840
could have another variable, v2 equals my there plus five and if we check v2 down here,

03:21.840 --> 03:23.440
see it says ten.

03:23.440 --> 03:28.480
So you can do all sorts of things with variables, you can do math and store it for later use

03:28.480 --> 03:32.080
and really whatever you need to do.

03:32.080 --> 03:37.040
The only other thing that variables can store is objects, but that's going to be in either

03:37.040 --> 03:41.640
the intermediate or the advanced section of these tutorials.

03:41.640 --> 03:47.360
So now you can play around with this a little bit, you may run into some problems because

03:47.360 --> 03:53.640
the stuff is confusing when you first learn it, but just try making assigning variables

03:53.640 --> 04:00.600
and then displaying them in a message box as you see here and I'll post this code exactly

04:00.600 --> 04:05.200
as it is on the blog in case you want to use it as a reference.

04:05.200 --> 04:05.640
Thank you.
