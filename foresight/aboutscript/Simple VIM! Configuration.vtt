This is Frankie and in this video we are going to talk about configuring Vim.

00:04.880 --> 00:11.120
So just like the previous video, if you haven't seen it, nothing crazy, nothing complicated,

00:11.120 --> 00:18.640
just the stuff that you need to be somewhat productive in Vim. Okay, so this is my Vim

00:18.640 --> 00:27.360
RC, which goes in your home directory. It's slash dot Vim RC. You can just edit it. It should

00:27.360 --> 00:33.280
already exist if you have Vim installed. So we'll just go over this one line at a time.

00:34.880 --> 00:41.280
Set tab stop for, set shift width for, set expand tab. So we're just going to look at these three

00:41.280 --> 00:48.960
first. This means by default indent with four spaces and when I press the tab key I want you to use

00:48.960 --> 00:57.280
spaces. The ruler is, I believe it just displays a ruler and we want everything to be saved as you

00:57.280 --> 01:04.320
TF8 by default. Great. So now what we have down here, I don't actually know what auto CMD file type

01:04.320 --> 01:12.320
means. All I know is that when the file type is YAML or YML, I want you to use two spaces and

01:13.440 --> 01:20.160
when it's fish or make, I want you to not, when I press tab, actually insert a tab.

01:21.040 --> 01:24.800
It is important in make and it's just what people do in fish.

01:27.280 --> 01:32.720
So then down here we get into a little bit of complicated stuff that I copied and pasted

01:33.600 --> 01:43.520
from here to here. So what this does is it trims white spaces at the end of line.

01:44.880 --> 01:50.720
I don't know. I guess there's no way, no button for this in Vim by default. Okay. So trim white spaces

01:51.280 --> 01:58.000
and then when I press F2 it calls trim white space and it gets rid of white spaces at the

01:58.000 --> 02:05.760
end of lines. So I can just go down here add some white space at the end of the line and then press

02:05.760 --> 02:14.560
F2 and it gets rid of it. Pretty self-explanatory. And then what this does here is it displays,

02:14.560 --> 02:18.720
you saw those characters when there's, when you have just like random white space hanging around

02:18.720 --> 02:24.720
at the end of lines, it just lets you know, so you know you have to clear it. That's, that's all that

02:24.720 --> 02:32.000
does. And here's the most complicated thing. I actually wrote this myself. So what it does is

02:32.000 --> 02:38.400
it's a function called toggle with and it checks if the shift width is four and if it is it sets it

02:38.400 --> 02:44.880
to two and then it displays a little thing at the bottom. I'm going to press this set indent to two,

02:44.880 --> 02:49.680
set indent to four, so it just toggles back and forth between them based on whatever the

02:49.680 --> 02:57.360
current shift width is. So if I'm in a file and it's using two indents or I want to use two indents,

02:57.920 --> 03:04.800
I just hit F3 and then it'll use two indents for everything. And down here I just bind it to F3.

03:05.920 --> 03:10.720
Now this is the important part. We're using pathogen, which is the easiest way to install

03:10.720 --> 03:17.200
plugins for Vim and Vim is very light by default. It doesn't have a lot of the useful things you

03:17.200 --> 03:24.720
want. So you need a way to have plugins installed. So we're just going to pop over to Chrome and see

03:24.720 --> 03:32.960
what pathogen is. So it's just a thing and you just run the command and it installs and then you

03:32.960 --> 03:40.560
just put the stuff in your Vim RC, fairly straightforward. And then when you want to

03:40.560 --> 03:44.400
install a plugin, like let's say we want to install Vim Go, which I don't have installed currently,

03:45.120 --> 03:52.080
you just google you know Vim Go because you want to use Go in Vim and then you scroll down

03:53.520 --> 03:58.800
and you see install and then it tells you how to install it with pathogen and you copy

03:59.040 --> 04:10.560
and you paste and it will install Vim Go and it's done. So in your home directory

04:11.200 --> 04:17.680
slash dot Vim is where all this stuff is. So you see you have the pathogen plugin thing here,

04:17.680 --> 04:22.800
which is automatically loaded. And then you have your other plugins, including Vim Go,

04:22.800 --> 04:33.120
which we just installed. So these plugins are anything varying from just here's how you should

04:33.120 --> 04:40.240
highlight this to this Go one, which looks very complicated from this picture here. It looks

04:40.240 --> 04:44.560
like it has a lot of crazy stuff in it. So that's going to be significantly different.

04:45.520 --> 04:51.360
Um, let's see. All of these things for the most part are syntax highlighting

04:52.480 --> 04:56.320
and editor config, which doesn't even work. I don't even know. I should probably just get

04:56.320 --> 05:03.760
rid of that. And you complete me is just, it's just like a general file completion,

05:03.760 --> 05:09.440
like probably if I were to type toggle, yeah, it just like pops up. There's nothing like this

05:09.440 --> 05:15.760
by default in Vim. And I just wanted something that more or less works. So that's just my generic

05:15.760 --> 05:20.960
file completion. It works in especially things that are seed like, it'll actually look across

05:20.960 --> 05:27.120
multiple files in the directory and find things that you probably meant to type there. So it's

05:27.120 --> 05:35.120
cool. And that's it. That's literally everything. A lot of people have like 5000 line VAMRCs and

05:35.200 --> 05:41.840
it's just crazy, but this is all I need at least. I hope this helped you and I hope you can use this

05:41.840 --> 05:46.960
and not too much more to have them working for you. I'll see you in the next video.
