1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Megan asks, how much of you are creating content versus making appearances and attending social

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
things like parties?

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,080
Megan, this is a great question.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,000
I often say that money and fame don't change anybody.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,960
They just expose who someone actually is at a bigger scale.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,560
And there's an enormous part of me that believes there's a lot of truth in that in technology

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,760
as well, right?

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,800
We're not making, you know, people like, I had this funny argument with this guy at

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,120
Wine Library the other day where he was like, you know, all these phones, the art of like

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,960
talking to each other, he goes, I was in Starbucks, this was great, I was in Starbucks and everybody

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,960
was head down.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,120
Nobody was talking to each other.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,640
I was like, where were you?

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,640
He's like, New York.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,520
I'm like, all right, let's talk about this for a second.

16
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,960
I'm like, do you think 13 years ago at Starbucks that people were just yapping with each other?

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,080
Like, hey brother, great shirt.

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,440
That's not how New York rolls, my man.

19
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,280
And so I think that all that technology is doing is making more visible what we actually

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
were going to do.

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,280
I mean, I do believe the far majority of people are introverted at first, at scale, by math.

22
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,760
If you asked me or any, I think, common sense person in society, I think we'd all agree

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,440
I'm looking for some reformation here, like, there's way more people that are going to

24
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,240
sit either timid or middle timid or somewhat timid than somebody who's just going to roll

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
up.

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:37,600
The reason we love and hate the people that just roll up and are loud, you got them?

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
Really?

28
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
On that angle, you get them?

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
You got Gabe right there?

30
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,520
Like, the reason Gabe, who works at VaynerMedia, is someone that so many people know is because

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,840
he's loud as shit, right?

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,040
And some people love it, and some people hate it, right?

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,440
But that's why he's an extrovert extreme.

34
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,080
He's probably like singing his song right now.

35
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,080
Looks like he's in a meeting.

36
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,960
He's probably just doing some Drake lyrics while he works.

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,560
And so I think that it's important for us to understand that, first of all, could you

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,560
be having an addiction?

39
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,560
Sure.

40
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,920
I mean, look, I think everybody's addicted to their cellular device.

41
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,120
I fully believe that every single person's addicted to their cell phone, like straight

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,120
up.

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,680
So, maybe, but I would say this.

44
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,160
I think that it's great for all the introverts or the people that don't like the party and

45
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,840
don't like to go out.

46
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,160
What they were doing before where they were interacting with the television.

47
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,640
I mean, let's call it what it is.

48
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,840
Or with like a very small group of one or two friends who equally were close in location

49
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,960
to them and were like that.

50
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:47,160
Now people can really communicate at scale with the people that have similar interests,

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,880
find new people and all that kind of stuff.

52
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,640
And so, I think that you are fine.

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,680
I think your picture is rad.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,920
I think you and I are friends.
