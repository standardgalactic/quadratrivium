Megan asks, how much of you are creating content versus making appearances and attending social

00:07.000 --> 00:08.000
things like parties?

00:08.000 --> 00:11.080
Megan, this is a great question.

00:11.080 --> 00:16.000
I often say that money and fame don't change anybody.

00:16.000 --> 00:20.960
They just expose who someone actually is at a bigger scale.

00:20.960 --> 00:25.560
And there's an enormous part of me that believes there's a lot of truth in that in technology

00:25.560 --> 00:27.760
as well, right?

00:27.760 --> 00:31.800
We're not making, you know, people like, I had this funny argument with this guy at

00:31.800 --> 00:36.120
Wine Library the other day where he was like, you know, all these phones, the art of like

00:36.120 --> 00:41.960
talking to each other, he goes, I was in Starbucks, this was great, I was in Starbucks and everybody

00:41.960 --> 00:42.960
was head down.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.120
Nobody was talking to each other.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.640
I was like, where were you?

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
He's like, New York.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.520
I'm like, all right, let's talk about this for a second.

00:48.520 --> 00:54.960
I'm like, do you think 13 years ago at Starbucks that people were just yapping with each other?

00:54.960 --> 00:57.080
Like, hey brother, great shirt.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.440
That's not how New York rolls, my man.

00:59.440 --> 01:05.280
And so I think that all that technology is doing is making more visible what we actually

01:05.280 --> 01:06.280
were going to do.

01:06.280 --> 01:12.280
I mean, I do believe the far majority of people are introverted at first, at scale, by math.

01:12.280 --> 01:16.760
If you asked me or any, I think, common sense person in society, I think we'd all agree

01:16.760 --> 01:20.440
I'm looking for some reformation here, like, there's way more people that are going to

01:20.440 --> 01:25.240
sit either timid or middle timid or somewhat timid than somebody who's just going to roll

01:25.240 --> 01:26.240
up.

01:26.400 --> 01:37.600
The reason we love and hate the people that just roll up and are loud, you got them?

01:37.600 --> 01:38.600
Really?

01:38.600 --> 01:39.600
On that angle, you get them?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.600
You got Gabe right there?

01:40.600 --> 01:46.520
Like, the reason Gabe, who works at VaynerMedia, is someone that so many people know is because

01:46.520 --> 01:49.840
he's loud as shit, right?

01:49.840 --> 01:54.040
And some people love it, and some people hate it, right?

01:54.040 --> 01:57.440
But that's why he's an extrovert extreme.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.080
He's probably like singing his song right now.

01:59.080 --> 02:00.080
Looks like he's in a meeting.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.960
He's probably just doing some Drake lyrics while he works.

02:02.960 --> 02:07.560
And so I think that it's important for us to understand that, first of all, could you

02:07.560 --> 02:08.560
be having an addiction?

02:08.560 --> 02:09.560
Sure.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.920
I mean, look, I think everybody's addicted to their cellular device.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.120
I fully believe that every single person's addicted to their cell phone, like straight

02:15.120 --> 02:16.120
up.

02:16.120 --> 02:21.680
So, maybe, but I would say this.

02:21.680 --> 02:27.160
I think that it's great for all the introverts or the people that don't like the party and

02:27.160 --> 02:28.840
don't like to go out.

02:28.840 --> 02:32.160
What they were doing before where they were interacting with the television.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.640
I mean, let's call it what it is.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.840
Or with like a very small group of one or two friends who equally were close in location

02:39.840 --> 02:41.960
to them and were like that.

02:41.960 --> 02:47.160
Now people can really communicate at scale with the people that have similar interests,

02:47.160 --> 02:49.880
find new people and all that kind of stuff.

02:49.880 --> 02:53.640
And so, I think that you are fine.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.680
I think your picture is rad.

02:55.680 --> 02:57.920
I think you and I are friends.
