0	7000	Megan asks, how much of you are creating content versus making appearances and attending social
7000	8000	things like parties?
8000	11080	Megan, this is a great question.
11080	16000	I often say that money and fame don't change anybody.
16000	20960	They just expose who someone actually is at a bigger scale.
20960	25560	And there's an enormous part of me that believes there's a lot of truth in that in technology
25560	27760	as well, right?
27760	31800	We're not making, you know, people like, I had this funny argument with this guy at
31800	36120	Wine Library the other day where he was like, you know, all these phones, the art of like
36120	41960	talking to each other, he goes, I was in Starbucks, this was great, I was in Starbucks and everybody
41960	42960	was head down.
42960	44120	Nobody was talking to each other.
44120	45640	I was like, where were you?
45640	46640	He's like, New York.
46640	48520	I'm like, all right, let's talk about this for a second.
48520	54960	I'm like, do you think 13 years ago at Starbucks that people were just yapping with each other?
54960	57080	Like, hey brother, great shirt.
57080	59440	That's not how New York rolls, my man.
59440	65280	And so I think that all that technology is doing is making more visible what we actually
65280	66280	were going to do.
66280	72280	I mean, I do believe the far majority of people are introverted at first, at scale, by math.
72280	76760	If you asked me or any, I think, common sense person in society, I think we'd all agree
76760	80440	I'm looking for some reformation here, like, there's way more people that are going to
80440	85240	sit either timid or middle timid or somewhat timid than somebody who's just going to roll
85240	86240	up.
86400	97600	The reason we love and hate the people that just roll up and are loud, you got them?
97600	98600	Really?
98600	99600	On that angle, you get them?
99600	100600	You got Gabe right there?
100600	106520	Like, the reason Gabe, who works at VaynerMedia, is someone that so many people know is because
106520	109840	he's loud as shit, right?
109840	114040	And some people love it, and some people hate it, right?
114040	117440	But that's why he's an extrovert extreme.
117440	119080	He's probably like singing his song right now.
119080	120080	Looks like he's in a meeting.
120080	122960	He's probably just doing some Drake lyrics while he works.
122960	127560	And so I think that it's important for us to understand that, first of all, could you
127560	128560	be having an addiction?
128560	129560	Sure.
129560	131920	I mean, look, I think everybody's addicted to their cellular device.
131920	135120	I fully believe that every single person's addicted to their cell phone, like straight
135120	136120	up.
136120	141680	So, maybe, but I would say this.
141680	147160	I think that it's great for all the introverts or the people that don't like the party and
147160	148840	don't like to go out.
148840	152160	What they were doing before where they were interacting with the television.
152160	154640	I mean, let's call it what it is.
154640	159840	Or with like a very small group of one or two friends who equally were close in location
159840	161960	to them and were like that.
161960	167160	Now people can really communicate at scale with the people that have similar interests,
167160	169880	find new people and all that kind of stuff.
169880	173640	And so, I think that you are fine.
173640	175680	I think your picture is rad.
175680	177920	I think you and I are friends.
