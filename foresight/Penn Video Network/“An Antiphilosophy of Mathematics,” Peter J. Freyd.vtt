WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:09.480
So, on behalf of the School of Arts and Sciences and Penn Engineering, I am very pleased to

00:09.480 --> 00:15.460
welcome you to the seventh annual Thomas and Yvonne Williams Lecture for the Advancement

00:15.460 --> 00:17.880
of Logic and Philosophy.

00:17.880 --> 00:24.120
We are most grateful for the generosity and vision that Tom and Yvonne have shown in establishing

00:24.120 --> 00:29.660
the fund that supports this series of lectures and that makes possible other educational

00:29.660 --> 00:35.620
activities at the university and at upper schools in our region.

00:35.620 --> 00:41.020
It was a great pleasure to work with Tom when I first arrived at Penn and to watch him develop

00:41.020 --> 00:47.140
through the study of Logic and Philosophy that clarity of mind which he has so successfully

00:47.140 --> 00:53.620
brought to bear in the sphere of practical affairs and that sustains his ongoing passion

00:53.620 --> 00:56.100
for the life of the mind.

00:56.100 --> 01:01.060
And it remains a great pleasure to work with him now on a range of activities that will

01:01.060 --> 01:08.140
advance a general appreciation of the power of reason to clarify problems both practical

01:08.140 --> 01:10.380
and theoretical.

01:10.380 --> 01:16.060
I am delighted to introduce this year's Williams Lecturer, Peter Fried.

01:16.060 --> 01:21.020
Peter is an internationally renowned expert on category theory and its applications in

01:21.020 --> 01:22.940
computer science.

01:22.940 --> 01:29.380
He pioneered the development of Topos theory and its use in articulating precise semantics

01:29.380 --> 01:31.980
for programming languages.

01:31.980 --> 01:39.980
In 2010, he was awarded the Lix Test of Time Award for his 1990 paper, Recursive Types

01:39.980 --> 01:43.140
Reduced to Inductive Types.

01:43.140 --> 01:48.980
Peter is professor of mathematics and of computer and information science here at Penn.

01:48.980 --> 01:56.140
He has played a leading role in the university's logic and computation group since its inception.

01:56.140 --> 02:04.180
His deep insights and fierce intellectual honesty have inspired the group for many years.

02:04.180 --> 02:10.580
Please join me in warmly welcoming Peter Fried who will speak to us about an anti-philosophy

02:10.580 --> 02:20.700
of mathematics.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.900
I received an email which is what I want to show you.

02:23.900 --> 02:27.900
The author refused to let me use his name.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.780
I will be talking about an anti-philosophy of mathematics but that's just one tiny thing

02:32.780 --> 02:38.740
compared with other things which are more in the realm of philosophy of mathematics.

02:38.900 --> 02:42.540
You will also hear that I have some things to say about anti-philosophies maybe of some

02:42.540 --> 02:44.500
other subjects.

02:44.500 --> 02:51.060
But I have to say this list of people, the first four names are from Brown University.

02:51.060 --> 02:55.780
By the way, there are names that are there that shouldn't be and some that shouldn't

02:55.780 --> 03:00.260
be but aren't and there are names that aren't there that shouldn't be.

03:00.260 --> 03:01.260
That's the very first one.

03:01.260 --> 03:06.980
Kurt Dukas, is that name still a name to contend with in the world of philosophy?

03:06.980 --> 03:12.380
He was well known in his day and I'm afraid that when I knew him, he was the grand old

03:12.380 --> 03:19.860
man of the Brown Philosophy Department, meaning he was about a year younger than I am now.

03:19.860 --> 03:30.220
His subject I'm afraid was a paranormal phenomena and I never sat at his feet.

03:30.220 --> 03:38.380
It wasn't until years later, like maybe ten years ago, that I find out that this is the

03:38.380 --> 03:44.220
founder of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, the first president of the Association of Symbolic

03:44.220 --> 03:46.580
Logic.

03:46.580 --> 03:49.100
There was no trace of that when I knew him.

03:49.100 --> 03:55.980
The next three are people from whom I took graduate courses in philosophy at Brown.

03:55.980 --> 04:03.700
Leslie Salmon has gone, I mean he was then something of a logician.

04:03.700 --> 04:06.500
He's progressed beyond that since.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.820
Stefan Koerner from England was there for just a year.

04:08.820 --> 04:12.580
It was essentially the beginning of his interest in the philosophy of mathematics.

04:12.580 --> 04:19.740
There were three, as I say, three, when I said graduate courses, they were in fact all seminars.

04:19.740 --> 04:21.860
Archism was the important one.

04:21.860 --> 04:25.860
He did have a strong influence on me over the years.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.500
I do have a copy of this.

04:28.500 --> 04:32.060
Oh, I've got one right here.

04:32.060 --> 04:34.980
Carl Hemple doesn't belong there.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.540
This now starts with a few names from Princeton.

04:38.540 --> 04:40.500
I had very little contact with him.

04:40.500 --> 04:47.180
Alonzo Church, the mystery to me about Alonzo Church is why he insisted I wasn't able to

04:47.300 --> 04:51.740
effest for his retirement.

04:51.740 --> 04:57.420
I finally received word years later, I mean I did listen to him occasionally, but I certainly

04:57.420 --> 05:00.340
never sat at his feet.

05:00.340 --> 05:07.300
Years later I found out from an organizer that he not only once made me, I made him

05:07.300 --> 05:13.500
laugh out loud, I did it twice and he thought that this was a remarkable achievement and

05:13.500 --> 05:20.100
therefore I should.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.620
Kurt Gertl, I never really had, but maybe the time will come.

05:23.620 --> 05:28.580
In fact, a number of the names now, mysteriously enough, even though I first met them or talked

05:28.580 --> 05:31.300
to them somewhere else, re-emerge as important figures.

05:31.300 --> 05:36.620
I have two microphones here at the moment.

05:36.620 --> 05:39.620
Here with connection with Penn, now there's a long story.

05:39.620 --> 05:44.140
When I received this email and looked at it, I realized that a whole bunch of stories

05:44.140 --> 05:55.140
to tell you about Penn in philosophy in the 1960s and nobody's left except me and to some

05:55.140 --> 06:00.460
good extent Eriven, who was attending about as many philosophy colloquy as I was, meaning

06:00.460 --> 06:02.500
all of them actually.

06:02.500 --> 06:09.500
Eriven has been at Penn since 1954 and was on the member of the faculty since 1961.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.580
I came in 62.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.940
If this were a year earlier, I could say that Jim Ross is part of that crowd.

06:15.940 --> 06:19.740
He also came in 62 and we attended the same graduate seminars.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.620
I should make that inclusion the right way.

06:22.620 --> 06:29.940
He attended the same graduate seminars that I did at Brown.

06:29.940 --> 06:34.420
Ernest Nagel, I talked to a bit at Columbia, but again, he comes up in connection with Penn.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.780
Now we come to the Penn part.

06:36.780 --> 06:39.820
We're represented actually by just a few names.

06:39.820 --> 06:43.260
Let me go back to 1962.

06:43.260 --> 06:48.300
It was a seller's market in those days, meaning that when you went to a math meeting, people

06:48.300 --> 06:52.180
started offering you jobs before they even knew your name.

06:52.180 --> 06:57.620
That's literally the correct.

06:57.620 --> 07:05.500
I agreed to come down to Penn as a favor to a young person in the faculty whom I knew.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.980
They did a sales job on me.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.580
Penn was in a state of receivership.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.820
That's not my word.

07:11.820 --> 07:12.820
That is my word.

07:12.820 --> 07:13.820
Sorry, it's not there.

07:13.820 --> 07:18.620
There was a receivership committee chaired, if I'm pretty sure, by Britt Chance.

07:18.620 --> 07:22.460
Is that right, Murray?

07:22.460 --> 07:25.820
Was Britt Chance the chair of the receivership committee for mathematics?

07:25.820 --> 07:27.060
You think about it.

07:27.060 --> 07:35.380
There was only one mathematician on the committee and they wanted to rebuild mathematics at Penn.

07:35.380 --> 07:39.780
They seemed to have what they considered a lot of money, and they insisted that I could

07:39.780 --> 07:44.860
build a department at Penn that I was 26 years old at that point.

07:44.860 --> 07:46.820
Actually they talked me into coming up.

07:46.820 --> 07:51.380
Penn's status in the Ivy League in those days was quite iffy.

07:51.380 --> 07:57.860
The phrase you would see in a number of publications was that Penn was de classe.

07:57.860 --> 07:59.980
How much of this is known anymore?

07:59.980 --> 08:03.780
Penn started, of course, as a football league, hence the word league.

08:04.780 --> 08:08.060
The Ivy League started as a football league.

08:08.060 --> 08:10.180
Penn had moved away from it.

08:10.180 --> 08:14.140
It was often considered the 11th Big Ten.

08:14.140 --> 08:18.820
The 11th Big Ten finally did come into formal existence and it turned out to be Penn State,

08:18.820 --> 08:21.700
but that's a different matter.

08:21.700 --> 08:26.820
Somewhere along the line, just a few years earlier, fortunately for all of us here, the

08:26.820 --> 08:34.180
university decided to renew its Ivy League football league status, which meant that they

08:34.180 --> 08:36.780
had to go along with all those rules.

08:36.780 --> 08:40.420
This has clearly had a tremendously good effect.

08:40.420 --> 08:45.100
It also gave Penn something of an advantage in hiring people.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.340
I did come.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.420
Now let's go back a bit.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.180
What was Penn known for in those days?

08:51.180 --> 08:55.380
I knew that it had a good medical division.

08:55.380 --> 09:00.700
Beyond that, it had four departments, just four.

09:00.700 --> 09:05.940
Anthropology, archaeology, they had been the best departments essentially in their subject

09:05.940 --> 09:09.660
from essentially the beginning.

09:09.660 --> 09:14.140
Linguistics and Nelson Goodman.

09:14.140 --> 09:17.020
That was it, meaning the philosophy department.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.300
I arrive here and guess what?

09:18.300 --> 09:21.620
Nelson Goodman isn't here.

09:21.620 --> 09:22.620
He was on leave.

09:22.620 --> 09:24.420
He was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

09:24.420 --> 09:27.020
It was clear that he had some very attractive offers, at least one.

09:27.020 --> 09:29.500
I'm not sure how many he actually had.

09:29.500 --> 09:34.900
A chairman had been hired away from the University of Buffalo.

09:34.900 --> 09:36.860
Marvin Farber.

09:36.860 --> 09:38.060
He should not be in this list.

09:38.060 --> 09:39.620
I certainly never sat at his feet.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.180
You'll hear quite the opposite in a moment.

09:41.180 --> 09:45.980
Well, he didn't sit at my feet, that's for sure.

09:45.980 --> 09:51.900
As it was with Ducasse, I was flabbergasted to learn later some aspects about Marvin Farber,

09:51.900 --> 09:56.380
such as the fact that he was, quote, and I'm quoting directly from the literature, a protégé

09:56.380 --> 09:58.260
of Zermelo.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.780
I learned that within the last week.

10:00.780 --> 10:05.020
That's absolutely flabbergasting to me.

10:05.020 --> 10:13.060
At those days, the University was run from the faculty club bar starting about five o'clock.

10:13.060 --> 10:17.380
The provost would arrive, fantastically good provost, David Goddard.

10:17.380 --> 10:20.820
You could do a lot of business if you were willing to go to the faculty club bar at that

10:20.820 --> 10:21.820
hour.

10:21.820 --> 10:26.180
I found myself there one evening, sitting at a table with the provost on one side, the

10:26.180 --> 10:32.100
dean of the, what they then called the dean of the college, and the other side, Otto Springer.

10:32.100 --> 10:34.300
His subject was German.

10:34.300 --> 10:40.100
The dean told the provost that much to his surprise, the department didn't want to keep

10:40.100 --> 10:43.060
Nelson Goodman.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.700
I didn't say a word.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.980
I thought I'd better check.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.140
I'd been going to Colloquy.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.540
I knew a good part of the department at that point.

10:51.540 --> 10:55.260
The next morning at about 8.30 in the morning in the provost's office, outer office, there

10:55.260 --> 10:56.340
was a crowd of us.

10:56.340 --> 10:59.780
I was the one nonmember of the department.

10:59.780 --> 11:00.780
Marvin Farber had lied.

11:00.780 --> 11:02.980
It was a straight out and out lie.

11:02.980 --> 11:06.940
He thought, why he thought he could get by with it is beyond my comprehension.

11:06.940 --> 11:12.380
We went into the provost's office for some reason, I guess precisely because I was the

11:12.380 --> 11:14.700
one nonmember of the department.

11:14.700 --> 11:20.940
People turned to me and I said, good boy, I said, we're here to recommend a university

11:20.940 --> 11:24.260
professorship for Nelson Goodman.

11:24.260 --> 11:25.260
That worked.

11:25.260 --> 11:30.100
He came back the next year, but only for one year he eventually did go back to Cambridge.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.220
But I was a, as I said, I was attending all the colloquy.

11:33.220 --> 11:39.740
I gave a number of colloquy in those years.

11:39.740 --> 11:46.540
And a receivership committee, again, not their word, my word, was set up under the

11:46.540 --> 11:53.580
chairmanship of the dean of the graduate school, Roy Nichols, historian.

11:53.580 --> 11:57.260
The very first meeting I was there, there was one philosopher, Joseph Clark, if that

11:57.260 --> 12:02.620
means Francis Clark, sorry, if that means anything to anybody, who never said a word

12:02.660 --> 12:05.140
in the entire history of that committee.

12:05.140 --> 12:10.980
On the opening day of the committee, the chairman said, of course we're going to go

12:10.980 --> 12:11.980
very slowly here.

12:11.980 --> 12:15.500
We're not going to make any rapid decisions.

12:15.500 --> 12:21.420
An hour later, the committee unanimously voted that we should make every effort to get Hao

12:21.420 --> 12:24.700
Wang to come to Penn.

12:24.700 --> 12:29.500
I was aware that Wang was movable for some family or personal reason from Harvard.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.940
And he damn near came, by the way.

12:31.940 --> 12:37.580
Rockefeller University got him from us at the end.

12:37.580 --> 12:45.900
But then I was hiring, at the age of 26, I was hiring people for temporary, well, yes,

12:45.900 --> 12:46.900
I was.

12:46.900 --> 12:47.900
I was hiring young people, actually.

12:47.900 --> 12:53.780
And the next name, Stanley Tenenbaum, is a part of that list.

12:53.780 --> 12:57.940
He was sane at that point.

12:57.940 --> 13:02.780
The next few years, we did see Paul Bernays, and now an interesting sequence of people

13:02.780 --> 13:07.220
who aren't on this list somehow were around here at Penn.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.300
One was John Mayhill.

13:09.300 --> 13:13.820
He was being kept alive, and that's literally the case, not by the philosophy department,

13:13.820 --> 13:17.500
but the computer scientists.

13:17.500 --> 13:22.940
That was, the computer science department didn't officially exist until 1972, but there

13:22.940 --> 13:30.740
was a graduate group in computer science.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.140
Mario Boonga was here.

13:32.140 --> 13:39.020
Now, I didn't have anything to do with that, but he was here.

13:39.020 --> 13:47.220
And at least from that, if I didn't sit at his feet, I at least got my first PhD student,

13:47.220 --> 13:48.220
namely his wife.

13:49.220 --> 13:53.260
Well, anyway, no, it's not a hoax, but it's not the way it appears.

13:53.260 --> 14:01.100
I do want to talk about a philosophy, a possible philosophy for mathematics, and so now I get

14:01.100 --> 14:04.540
a bit more serious.

14:04.540 --> 14:09.220
So by the way, just before I leave it, as I said, as far as I can tell, only one person

14:09.220 --> 14:14.500
left who was actually part of that receivership committee and all that sort of thing.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.900
Well, that I know for sure.

14:17.900 --> 14:24.260
It's a strange, weird little piece of history that you had a philosophy department a few

14:24.260 --> 14:30.540
years earlier, had an international renown in which a 26-year-old, two years out of his

14:30.540 --> 14:35.860
own PhD was hiring people from the philosophy department.

14:35.860 --> 14:40.700
Well, Jim Ross became chairman, and the rest is history.

14:40.700 --> 14:46.460
By the way, the first person presently here to come after that was Charles Kahn.

14:47.180 --> 14:48.900
That was 1964.

14:52.780 --> 15:00.340
So, yes, so as any mathematician knows, if you're going to talk about something you need

15:00.340 --> 15:06.420
a definition, as just about every philosopher knows, if you're lucky, you'll end up with

15:06.420 --> 15:11.620
definitions, not start out with them, and that, of course, is the case with mathematics,

15:11.620 --> 15:15.380
and there's the central question, how in hell do you define mathematics?

15:15.380 --> 15:17.020
And I want to start there.

15:19.660 --> 15:26.740
It was, there's an informal reason for wanting something like a definition, as you all know,

15:26.740 --> 15:30.940
that you try to communicate to people who aren't mathematicians what it is that mathematicians

15:30.940 --> 15:32.940
do.

15:32.940 --> 15:37.820
And I was, and so I wouldn't consider this to be anything serious, but it was just effort

15:37.820 --> 15:40.180
of communication.

15:40.180 --> 15:45.460
If I'm in the right mood, I found over the years, if you want an interesting time, casually

15:45.460 --> 15:51.740
say that, oh, you invent mathematics and watch the reaction, but if you're not in the mood

15:51.740 --> 15:57.060
for that, that you have to be in a special mood for.

15:57.060 --> 16:03.380
You want to communicate that mathematics is a subject matter, that it's not just a body

16:03.380 --> 16:09.420
of techniques, so one wants to distinguish between mathematics on one hand and the mathematical

16:09.420 --> 16:16.020
on the other hand, albeit mathematics presumably is one of the mathematical subjects.

16:16.020 --> 16:22.100
And in that process, I find, I found myself saying like things, it is a subject matter.

16:22.100 --> 16:27.140
I would use the phrase, it is about something.

16:27.140 --> 16:36.380
1969, the summertime, in the city of Brunswick, Maine, I was saying that to a group of people.

16:36.380 --> 16:41.820
And another mathematician, now dead, named John Isbill, interrupted me and said, I don't

16:41.820 --> 16:48.540
know if it's about something, but I do know that it's not arbitrary.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.140
And he instantly stopped me.

16:51.140 --> 16:55.380
Now John didn't want to go so far as to say that you could define that mathematics.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.620
You could use that to define mathematics.

16:57.620 --> 17:02.300
I'm not sure if you can, as you'll hear that we have to keep poking the definition to get

17:02.300 --> 17:04.820
something that actually works.

17:04.820 --> 17:10.380
But the way I first wanted to phrase it was, if there were a word in English that stood

17:10.380 --> 17:16.500
as the opposite of arbitrary, I could use that word to say what mathematics was, what

17:16.500 --> 17:19.740
the subject matter of mathematics was.

17:19.740 --> 17:24.860
And in fact, English may have that word, the word may be mathematics.

17:24.860 --> 17:26.260
And there's a lot that stems from this.

17:26.260 --> 17:32.620
I mean, you can proceed, in fact, in the next half hour or so, I will try to give some examples

17:32.620 --> 17:39.380
of answering some typical questions, such as, for instance, the unreasonable effectiveness

17:39.380 --> 17:47.300
of mathematics to use Wigner's wonderful title of his paper.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.020
But now let me jump right now.

17:49.020 --> 17:52.980
This isn't all I have to say about it, but where this notion of anti-philosophy comes

17:52.980 --> 17:53.980
from.

17:53.980 --> 18:00.220
There's the possibility, if that's the case, that mathematics is that which is least arbitrary,

18:00.460 --> 18:08.740
when you ask the question, what is the meaning of a sentence in mathematics, you're asking

18:08.740 --> 18:14.540
for something, if you think about it, necessarily more arbitrary than mathematics.

18:14.540 --> 18:17.940
And therefore, it may not be a well-posed question.

18:17.940 --> 18:22.980
Now, there are many anti-philosophies in this sense of the word, meaning, in fact, I've

18:22.980 --> 18:26.740
been predicting for years that somebody is going to come along and prove a girdle-like

18:26.780 --> 18:35.380
theorem to the effect that any language sufficiently rich, that to be defined, necessarily allows

18:35.380 --> 18:43.140
you to ask questions which don't have any conceivable answer, but sound as if they should.

18:43.140 --> 18:46.820
We're used to that in a number of special cases.

18:46.820 --> 18:52.620
We're used, for instance, in mathematics, except this is a very applied mathematics,

18:52.660 --> 18:58.340
to know that to ask what frequencies are present in a signal at a given instance, it just doesn't

18:58.340 --> 18:59.340
make sense.

18:59.340 --> 19:02.740
You can't, I mean, the definition of frequency or how you would measure it is such that you

19:02.740 --> 19:08.620
can't ask that question without specifying a non-zero interval.

19:08.620 --> 19:14.260
And this indeterminacy between time and frequency, of course, can be used to explain just about

19:14.260 --> 19:17.380
all the physical indeterminacies.

19:17.380 --> 19:20.900
Or some other ones, for instance, the curvature of space.

19:20.900 --> 19:26.500
To ask what's the curvature of space, you can't expect to get an answer unless you

19:26.500 --> 19:30.020
start talking about how you're going to use physics to measure it.

19:30.020 --> 19:33.620
So you need to know the physics you're assuming in order to answer the question, what's the

19:33.620 --> 19:38.460
curvature of space, meaning real space, the space we live in.

19:38.460 --> 19:44.820
And there are a whole bunch of things like that that we're already used to.

19:44.820 --> 19:50.100
There's one which I like to throw at mathematicians as an example.

19:50.100 --> 19:54.000
But I warn you, people can get very upset at this one.

19:54.000 --> 19:58.900
If somebody takes set theory as a serious foundational language for mathematics, I can

19:58.900 --> 20:04.300
pose to him, because of its untyped nature, the question, are there any simple groups

20:04.300 --> 20:07.180
that appear as zeros of the zeta function?

20:07.180 --> 20:09.660
I've seen people get very angry at this.

20:09.660 --> 20:11.980
I've seen people forget why I mentioned it.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.380
I didn't really ask it.

20:13.380 --> 20:14.260
I only mentioned it.

20:17.260 --> 20:22.340
I've had people come back to me two weeks later swearing at me for bringing up such

20:22.340 --> 20:23.980
an absurd question.

20:23.980 --> 20:26.860
Okay, that's transparently absurd.

20:26.860 --> 20:29.900
Notice, by the way, you have no way of answering it at all, even if you took it for

20:29.900 --> 20:34.580
the moment seriously, until you specify what definition of group you have in mind and

20:34.580 --> 20:37.660
what definition of complex number.

20:37.660 --> 20:41.540
And then after somebody specifies them, I've challenged people, now proved to me that

20:41.580 --> 20:43.420
there aren't any simple groups that he's got.

20:46.420 --> 20:47.940
Look, as I say, there are a lot of these.

20:47.940 --> 20:52.660
And one of them may be, one of these questions I'm suggesting may be,

20:52.660 --> 20:56.140
what is the meaning of a mathematical sentence?

20:56.140 --> 20:57.100
Well, let me come back to that.

20:59.540 --> 21:01.780
But that's the only thing that anti-philosophy means there.

21:04.140 --> 21:09.460
The idea that the non-arbitraryness of mathematics might be its defining characteristic.

21:10.460 --> 21:14.500
Maybe, I'm not sure about defining characteristic, but it's certainly an important aspect that

21:14.500 --> 21:17.460
of it, of course, has been anticipated any number of times.

21:17.460 --> 21:22.460
Indeed, the most famous definition of mathematics that exists is right here.

21:23.460 --> 21:24.500
See if I can scale it down.

21:25.940 --> 21:26.860
I can't scale it down.

21:27.860 --> 21:28.460
Can I move it?

21:31.860 --> 21:32.820
There we go, let's see.

21:33.940 --> 21:36.860
I seem not to be able to scale that down, or now it's too small.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.020
Leave it like that.

21:38.020 --> 21:38.900
Leave it like this, okay.

21:40.460 --> 21:43.860
You notice that, except it's not there.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.900
There must have been an easier way of doing this.

21:49.900 --> 21:53.060
Anyway, it's mathematics is the science which draws necessary conclusions.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.060
Why is it in handwriting?

21:55.060 --> 21:57.380
Okay, another little story about Penn from the 60s.

21:58.380 --> 22:00.060
In fact, this is 1962.

22:00.060 --> 22:03.460
The graduate students in the math department came to me with this funny looking book.

22:03.460 --> 22:04.900
It was about this size, very thin.

22:05.980 --> 22:09.060
And each page looked like this, except for the title page.

22:10.060 --> 22:13.060
The damn thing was hand lithographed.

22:14.700 --> 22:18.460
It turns out from a single lithograph stone that they kept cleaning for

22:18.460 --> 22:20.860
the next 100 copies, there are only 100 editions.

22:22.460 --> 22:26.700
This is the first publication, official publication of the National Academy of

22:26.700 --> 22:29.260
Sciences that hadn't been founded that much earlier.

22:30.860 --> 22:34.460
It was finally, I think, appeared around 1872.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.860
The lecture was 1870.

22:36.860 --> 22:38.860
And it is the book and title.

22:38.860 --> 22:40.260
The title is there visible here.

22:41.260 --> 22:43.060
A Linear Associate of Algebra.

22:43.060 --> 22:44.460
Let me just talk about it for a moment.

22:44.460 --> 22:46.260
It doesn't really have anything to do with the philosophy.

22:46.260 --> 22:50.460
But it's fascinating that this book was just stacked in the,

22:50.460 --> 22:55.060
appeared in the stacks at the Penn Library one floor down.

22:55.060 --> 22:58.860
I actually kept it in my house for a year, enjoyed showing it to people.

22:58.860 --> 23:01.860
And wondering if they'd ever noticed that it was missing.

23:01.860 --> 23:02.860
They never did.

23:03.860 --> 23:10.860
I took it to the rare books side of the library where it still resides,

23:10.860 --> 23:11.860
I'm pretty sure.

23:12.860 --> 23:14.860
As far as I could tell in the last week,

23:14.860 --> 23:18.860
I can find no evidence that any copy of it has ever been sold, amazingly.

23:19.860 --> 23:23.860
Apparently, at least there isn't any record of any, so nobody knows the value of it.

23:25.860 --> 23:28.860
Benjamin Purse's son, I haven't given the name yet, have I?

23:33.860 --> 23:34.860
I can't.

23:35.860 --> 23:37.860
Unfortunately, I have no control over here.

23:37.860 --> 23:40.860
There are other pages I could look at, but I can't at the moment.

23:42.860 --> 23:43.860
Benjamin Purse.

23:43.860 --> 23:46.860
So since his name isn't here, let me at least write it.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.860
And indeed, this is about the end of it.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.860
This was the only thing I wanted this for.

23:52.860 --> 23:56.860
So why don't we kill this and get rid of the screens?

23:59.860 --> 24:00.860
No, it didn't work.

24:00.860 --> 24:02.860
Turn off left projector.

24:02.860 --> 24:03.860
Turn off right projector.

24:06.860 --> 24:07.860
And let's take these down.

24:08.860 --> 24:09.860
Let's take them up.

24:09.860 --> 24:12.860
I used to think I only had left, right confusion.

24:21.860 --> 24:23.860
I am not misspelling it.

24:24.860 --> 24:33.860
I once had two signed recommendations on my desk, both from Harvard Purse instructors,

24:33.860 --> 24:36.860
both of whom thought that they were Pierce instructors.

24:36.860 --> 24:39.860
Next time I saw Barry Mazer, in fact, he was that.

24:39.860 --> 24:40.860
I said, here, I've got to show you these.

24:40.860 --> 24:41.860
He said, I don't want to see.

24:41.860 --> 24:42.860
I've given up.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.860
You can't do it.

24:44.860 --> 24:46.860
The name is spelled that way, and it is Purse.

24:46.860 --> 24:51.860
The book, which I was just showing is, by the way, for the mathematicians in the crowd,

24:51.860 --> 24:57.860
is the first known instance of such words as it impotent, neopotent.

24:57.860 --> 24:59.860
The person's decomposition is there.

24:59.860 --> 25:02.860
Of course, he doesn't give it a name.

25:02.860 --> 25:08.860
It is commonly said to be the first book in mathematics ever published in America.

25:08.860 --> 25:14.860
His son, far better known than Benjamin Charles Sanders, got it reprinted about 10 years later

25:14.860 --> 25:18.860
after his father had died, and then, in fact, put it into a book form made a number of changes

25:18.860 --> 25:22.860
where it did gain some frequency, particularly in Europe.

25:22.860 --> 25:30.860
I've even seen the statement that it is the first work in science to come out of the United States,

25:30.860 --> 25:38.860
which meant that whoever wrote that hadn't heard of Benjamin Franklin, but that's a different issue.

25:38.860 --> 25:43.860
There was a wonderful period when I could go around, and then the question became too well-known,

25:43.860 --> 25:47.860
and I really enjoyed doing this with electrical engineers in this building,

25:47.860 --> 25:52.860
and I'd say, who's the greatest electrical engineer ever associated with Penn?

25:52.860 --> 25:53.860
And they wouldn't know.

25:53.860 --> 25:58.860
And, of course, it was the inventor of the lightning rod and the words positive and negative

25:58.860 --> 26:01.860
and conductance and resistance and all those words.

26:01.860 --> 26:03.860
So, sorry.

26:03.860 --> 26:07.860
Go on here.

26:07.860 --> 26:09.860
Where was I?

26:09.860 --> 26:13.860
Oh, just how the first book came in, but where was I?

26:13.860 --> 26:15.860
I've lost track of what I was saying.

26:15.860 --> 26:19.860
There's his name, at least.

26:19.860 --> 26:21.860
That book, that sentence, rather.

26:21.860 --> 26:23.860
I had no idea it was in that book.

26:23.860 --> 26:24.860
That sentence.

26:24.860 --> 26:26.860
Oh, let me say a little bit more about this.

26:26.860 --> 26:27.860
Sorry about that book.

26:27.860 --> 26:32.860
It's fascinating because Benjamin Purse did have a lot to say about the philosophy of mathematics,

26:32.860 --> 26:37.860
and his book is a counter-example to almost everything he said.

26:37.860 --> 26:43.860
He amazingly was dedicated to applied mathematicians, mathematics.

26:43.860 --> 26:46.860
This book, the linear associative algebra, I should tell you,

26:46.860 --> 26:53.860
classified all associative algebras over the reels up to dimension six.

26:53.860 --> 26:55.860
It created a subject.

26:55.860 --> 26:56.860
Well, not quite the subject.

26:56.860 --> 26:59.860
It may be in that generality it created it.

26:59.860 --> 27:03.860
And it's the only thing that he did that was, the only important thing that he did that was actually

27:03.860 --> 27:06.860
in pure mathematics as opposed to applied mathematics.

27:07.860 --> 27:16.860
Quite remarkable how that work, which has his most famous single statement about the nature of mathematics,

27:16.860 --> 27:21.860
was in fact a counter-example to his philosophy of mathematics.

27:21.860 --> 27:26.860
Now, there's a word in that line, which I want to take quite seriously.

27:26.860 --> 27:28.860
Let me pause for a moment.

27:28.860 --> 27:31.860
Gratton Guinness has published a very nice history of the work.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.860
He got hold of some original manuscripts and whatnot.

27:33.860 --> 27:37.860
And the word necessary comes in quite late.

27:37.860 --> 27:44.860
For a while, it was mathematics is the subject which draws conclusions,

27:44.860 --> 27:46.860
tried inferences, a few other things.

27:46.860 --> 27:53.860
And apparently from some correspondence, he was troubled by the fact that the same thing could be said about law.

27:53.860 --> 27:56.860
So he decided to put the word necessary in there.

27:56.860 --> 27:59.860
Word necessary is not the same as arbitrary.

27:59.860 --> 28:02.860
And in fact, of course, the words are different.

28:02.860 --> 28:05.860
But in fact, it's easy to find counter-examples in each direction.

28:05.860 --> 28:06.860
But it's similar.

28:06.860 --> 28:08.860
It's in that nature.

28:08.860 --> 28:13.860
But the more important word from my point of view is the word conclusions.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.860
Because without theorems, there's no mathematics.

28:16.860 --> 28:19.860
And so that has to be added to the mix.

28:19.860 --> 28:22.860
It's not enough to say you're non-arbitrary.

28:22.860 --> 28:25.860
You also have to have theorems.

28:25.860 --> 28:28.860
So let me give an outrageous example.

28:28.860 --> 28:34.860
If you want a lot of theorems, sorry, the other way,

28:34.860 --> 28:39.860
if you want a lot of non-arbitraryness, just start with an empty theory, right?

28:39.860 --> 28:41.860
And then you're totally non-arbitrary.

28:41.860 --> 28:43.860
You don't have to worry about anything.

28:43.860 --> 28:48.860
So clearly you have to have some criterion for having theorems.

28:48.860 --> 28:50.860
Couple that in.

28:50.860 --> 28:54.860
The existence of theorems in the non-arbitraryness.

28:54.860 --> 29:00.860
I don't think there's a huge mystery about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.

29:00.860 --> 29:05.860
First of all, it's worth noting that very small part of mathematics, I think,

29:05.860 --> 29:07.860
ever finds an application.

29:07.860 --> 29:09.860
See, there's a problem of perception here.

29:09.860 --> 29:13.860
There's all sorts of areas of mathematics we've now totally forgotten about

29:13.860 --> 29:17.860
because they've stopped doing theorems and they never found an application.

29:18.860 --> 29:24.860
So one which I like to take as an example is finite geometry.

29:24.860 --> 29:27.860
Finite projective planes, for instance.

29:27.860 --> 29:32.860
I don't think anybody has ever talked about a conceivable application for that subject.

29:32.860 --> 29:38.860
The last, with one exception, the last theorem was proven probably well over 100 years ago.

29:38.860 --> 29:44.860
The big question is, why is it that all finite projective planes have prime power order?

29:44.860 --> 29:46.860
That's a matter of observation.

29:46.860 --> 29:48.860
Nobody's found a counter example.

29:48.860 --> 29:53.860
Since I am talking about, let me say, the one exception was that about 20 years ago,

29:53.860 --> 29:58.860
they did prove that there are no projective planes of order 10.

29:58.860 --> 30:01.860
Six is easy, comparatively.

30:01.860 --> 30:04.860
10 is, took one hell of a lot of work.

30:04.860 --> 30:06.860
Tremendous amount of computer time.

30:06.860 --> 30:08.860
I have a personal story.

30:08.860 --> 30:14.860
I was having breakfast at John Thompson's place in, it was a Sunday morning in Cambridge

30:14.860 --> 30:16.860
when, what's his first name?

30:16.860 --> 30:19.860
He pronounces it McCoy, spells it McKay.

30:19.860 --> 30:25.860
John McCoy came with a wonderful news that because of a lot of work of John Thompson,

30:25.860 --> 30:29.860
they had reduced the question down to something that wouldn't cost more in computer time

30:29.860 --> 30:31.860
than it had cost to get a man in the moon.

30:31.860 --> 30:35.860
And so therefore one knows that we could do it, right?

30:35.860 --> 30:38.860
In the next 10 years or so, actually it was about eight years,

30:38.860 --> 30:43.860
the improvement of computers and the improvement of the method for search got down

30:43.860 --> 30:45.860
so that in fact they got an answer.

30:45.860 --> 30:47.860
12 is still open.

30:47.860 --> 30:51.860
So it's a subject with essentially no theorems left.

30:51.860 --> 30:56.860
And the other hand has consumed tremendous amount of time

30:56.860 --> 30:59.860
on the part of mathematicians over the ages,

30:59.860 --> 31:04.860
including what was almost certainly the history's greatest group theorist, John Thompson.

31:04.860 --> 31:08.860
And in fact he will come in occasionally in the morning, he used to, and come in and said,

31:08.860 --> 31:10.860
I was thinking about the problem again.

31:10.860 --> 31:15.860
And the problem meant a projective geometry, finite projective geometry.

31:15.860 --> 31:18.860
If you don't know what finite projective geometry is,

31:18.860 --> 31:21.860
it doesn't matter, it has actually no relevance to what I've just been saying,

31:21.860 --> 31:25.860
since it's never found an application.

31:25.860 --> 31:30.860
But a certain minority of mathematics does find applications and it looks remarkable.

31:30.860 --> 31:35.860
If you look at Wigner's paper, he points to these branches of mathematics

31:35.860 --> 31:38.860
that had nothing to do with physics in the beginning,

31:38.860 --> 31:42.860
nothing to do with the real world, and yet they became important in physics.

31:42.860 --> 31:44.860
But they were non-arbitrary.

31:44.860 --> 31:46.860
Number one, number two, they had theorems.

31:46.860 --> 31:50.860
Now the importance of theorems I think should be clear, but let's pause for a moment.

31:50.860 --> 31:55.860
The group theory has had incredible number of applications.

31:55.860 --> 31:58.860
And it's a subject which has just incredible theorems, right?

31:58.860 --> 32:00.860
I mean, I think it strikes everybody.

32:00.860 --> 32:03.860
Amazing, starting with so little, how much you get.

32:03.860 --> 32:06.860
Well, group theory is officially a part of semi-group theory.

32:06.860 --> 32:08.860
There is something called semi-group theory.

32:08.860 --> 32:11.860
It has very few theorems that aren't about groups,

32:11.860 --> 32:15.860
and yet the world has far more semi-groups than groups.

32:15.860 --> 32:21.860
They're all over the place, and it's never become anything close to an applied subject.

32:21.860 --> 32:26.860
Not peculiarly enough, if you even further generalize it,

32:26.860 --> 32:31.860
and it's possible to view categories as a generalization of semi-groups,

32:31.860 --> 32:34.860
then amazingly it finds applications.

32:34.860 --> 32:38.860
Now having lived through this, having lived in a subject which was criticized

32:38.860 --> 32:42.860
for being so far abstract that it couldn't possibly have anything to do with anything,

32:42.860 --> 32:45.860
and then watching two different subjects, quite disparate,

32:45.860 --> 32:48.860
physics, theoretical physics on one hand and computer science on the other,

32:48.860 --> 32:51.860
finding applications of it,

32:51.860 --> 32:54.860
but of course it was the theorems that got applied, not just the language.

32:54.860 --> 32:59.860
It was the fact that there were theorems in each subject that were looked at

32:59.860 --> 33:06.860
after the fact as if they were tailor-made for the application.

33:06.860 --> 33:12.860
So I don't consider that a huge mystery, is what I'm saying.

33:12.860 --> 33:16.860
But notice now that I've slipped in something here.

33:16.860 --> 33:20.860
Notice that Purse's word was conclusions.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.860
My word is theorems.

33:22.860 --> 33:23.860
What's the difference?

33:23.860 --> 33:25.860
There is certainly a difference.

33:25.860 --> 33:33.860
There are all sorts of conclusions that none of us would call theorems.

33:33.860 --> 33:35.860
And so what's the difference?

33:35.860 --> 33:38.860
Well, interesting, interest.

33:38.860 --> 33:44.860
So there's an aesthetic issue involved here.

33:44.860 --> 33:47.860
Does it all come down to aesthetics?

33:47.860 --> 33:49.860
I mean, what makes a theorem interesting?

33:50.860 --> 33:52.860
Why do we tend to agree?

33:52.860 --> 33:56.860
Which is a remarkable amount of agreement compared with other subjects

33:56.860 --> 34:00.860
on what's interesting and what isn't.

34:00.860 --> 34:04.860
There could well be a philosophy of the aesthetics of mathematics.

34:04.860 --> 34:07.860
I'm not aware of it.

34:07.860 --> 34:11.860
People are making aesthetic judgments all the time.

34:11.860 --> 34:17.860
It's constantly being made while you're doing mathematics, while you're learning mathematics.

34:17.860 --> 34:18.860
It is different.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.860
Making the aesthetic judgment strikes me as something different

34:21.860 --> 34:24.860
from studying the philosophy of such judgments.

34:24.860 --> 34:28.860
That seems to be true everywhere you use the word aesthetics.

34:28.860 --> 34:34.860
Let me pause just for a moment here, by the way, about what I intended to say this earlier,

34:34.860 --> 34:37.860
since the notion of aesthetics has arisen.

34:37.860 --> 34:44.860
That same line that John Isbell used, I don't know about that, but it is an arbitrary,

34:44.860 --> 34:48.860
it can be used other places besides mathematics, you know, and I found it useful.

34:48.860 --> 34:55.860
So right on this campus a few years ago, I discovered that architects are used to

34:55.860 --> 35:04.860
explaining what they feel about aesthetics with the line that aesthetics are innate.

35:04.860 --> 35:09.860
I said, I don't know if they're innate, I just quoted Isbell, it just changed the subject.

35:09.860 --> 35:13.860
I don't know if aesthetics are innate, but I do know they're non-arbitrary.

35:13.860 --> 35:16.860
And that's, of course, what they meant.

35:16.860 --> 35:20.860
There's no need for them to be innate, they might be, who knows, it's irrelevant.

35:20.860 --> 35:26.860
So let me, the notion of arbitrariness, of course, now I haven't paused over it.

35:26.860 --> 35:30.860
I do need some special properties on this.

35:30.860 --> 35:33.860
First of all, notice it's not dichotomous.

35:33.860 --> 35:38.860
Some things are more arbitrary than others.

35:38.860 --> 35:41.860
Chess is more arbitrary than go.

35:41.860 --> 35:45.860
I found people who don't see that right away.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.860
But think of the opening position in chess.

35:48.860 --> 35:54.860
The whole bunch of arbitrary decisions were made in order to invent that opening position.

35:54.860 --> 35:59.860
You could ask why are the bishops closer to the center of the board than the knights.

35:59.860 --> 36:06.860
I don't think anybody ever, if there's any evidence that anybody ever experimented with the other possible opening positions, I've not found it.

36:06.860 --> 36:10.860
And notice an experiment would be almost unbelievably difficult

36:10.860 --> 36:18.860
because you'd have to wait a few hundred years to find out whether those opening positions led to interesting games, right?

36:18.860 --> 36:26.860
Go seems to be almost entirely, there's one clearly arbitrary aspect of it, and that's the size of the board, 19 by 19.

36:26.860 --> 36:29.860
There are some others, by the way, just to be sure here.

36:29.860 --> 36:32.860
There are different ways of scoring.

36:32.860 --> 36:37.860
They almost always agree on who the winner is, but there are different ways.

36:37.860 --> 36:43.860
There are different ways of resolving the possibility of periodicities.

36:43.860 --> 36:50.860
You might have a game that goes around in circles, and so you want something to prevent that, and there are some different choices.

36:50.860 --> 37:02.860
But interesting, in my looking at the literature on go, people who are serious about go seem to take those as variations of the game of go.

37:02.860 --> 37:10.860
There are standard things, standard ways in which international championships are decided, but whatnot, but they are viewed as arbitrary.

37:10.860 --> 37:20.860
So here's a case, notice that the notion of arbitrariness is you enhance the non-arbitrariness by generalizing,

37:20.860 --> 37:24.860
but please keep in mind there are plenty of cases where it goes just the other way.

37:24.860 --> 37:29.860
Clearly the single most non-arbitrary thing we study is the natural numbers.

37:29.860 --> 37:34.860
And that's one, you know, it's categorical in the old-fashioned sense of the word.

37:34.860 --> 37:42.860
There aren't any variations of what natural numbers means in the sense of number theory without an adjective in front of the word number.

37:42.860 --> 37:52.860
So one has to tinker a bit with the notion of arbitrariness to begin to make this work.

37:53.860 --> 38:03.860
There is a thought experiment, but every so often I do meet somebody who I find resistant to this notion of what do I mean by arbitrariness.

38:03.860 --> 38:10.860
Well there's a clear thought experiment which I know that I use, I'm not sure other people want to use it,

38:10.860 --> 38:20.860
but the thought experiment I'm talking about is what do you expect when you talk to another intelligence species in another solar system?

38:21.860 --> 38:27.860
You pretty much expect them to have a game of chess, but it won't be our game of chess, right?

38:27.860 --> 38:30.860
I mean that sounds highly improbable that they would.

38:30.860 --> 38:38.860
In fact, I think if we had chess with the same opening position we would immediately have evidence that we had a common ancestor somehow.

38:38.860 --> 38:45.860
One other alternative you have to hold in mind, it is possible that there was an evolutionary process that games were experimented with

38:45.860 --> 38:48.860
and it was settled on this one other than by accident.

38:48.860 --> 38:52.860
Same thing by the way when it comes of course to physics, that's the better known case,

38:52.860 --> 39:00.860
that the things that are arbitrary in physics like the certain constants and things like that, this has received a lot of attention of course.

39:00.860 --> 39:11.860
There's the anthropic view that we happen to be in one of many, many universes in which the constants are well designed for us to be in it and therefore to observe it.

39:11.860 --> 39:17.860
There's the other possibility which I find much more enticing, but apparently it hasn't led anywhere,

39:17.860 --> 39:23.860
that you want to define a structure which could evolve into the right constants.

39:23.860 --> 39:29.860
So the one that first attracted me early enough, I mean it seems awfully arbitrary to me initially,

39:29.860 --> 39:33.860
that the dimension of the space we live in is three.

39:33.860 --> 39:40.860
Now what we mean by dimension has radically changed, so mathematicians want to say dimension in the small or in the large or something.

39:40.860 --> 39:43.860
This turns out to be dimension in the middle somewhere, right?

39:43.860 --> 39:49.860
So the perceptual dimension I guess is what I want to say, is one possible way of saying it.

39:49.860 --> 40:00.860
You can argue easily enough that if the dimension went three then you wouldn't expect something like the inverse square law for a force.

40:00.860 --> 40:08.860
But if you're thinking of dimension as only integer valued as not something that can vary continuously in some sense,

40:08.860 --> 40:12.860
then that sounds too arbitrary.

40:12.860 --> 40:17.860
So therefore have some nature of space in which you can have fractional dimensions,

40:17.860 --> 40:22.860
and of course the relevant notion is something called Hausdorff dimension, whatever that is.

40:22.860 --> 40:30.860
Yeah, it's essentially the relationship between the radius of a sphere and the amount of how much it contains.

40:30.860 --> 40:36.860
And that you would like some picture, some system in which you could argue that if it varied away from dimension three,

40:36.860 --> 40:41.860
things would cause it to bounce back, to come back to dimension three,

40:41.860 --> 40:49.860
that if you got over dimension three then the forces would dissipate too quickly, that sort of thing.

40:49.860 --> 40:56.860
And you would then maybe end up with a picture of space, of all the physics maybe, in which nothing was arbitrary.

40:57.860 --> 41:02.860
And in that case I would say we would start thinking of it as a branch of mathematics.

41:02.860 --> 41:04.860
That hasn't happened yet.

41:04.860 --> 41:08.860
So we have to patch up the notion of arbitrary to make this work,

41:08.860 --> 41:13.860
and you can't escape the fact that you're going to end up deciding that things are interesting or not,

41:13.860 --> 41:15.860
and that that's an important part of it.

41:15.860 --> 41:19.860
The importance of by the way of being interesting,

41:19.860 --> 41:22.860
if you want one hell of a lot of theorems,

41:22.860 --> 41:25.860
and you don't care, maybe I should say conclusions,

41:25.860 --> 41:28.860
and not care about the interest,

41:28.860 --> 41:30.860
then it's perfectly simple what you want to do.

41:30.860 --> 41:32.860
You want to adopt an inconsistent theory,

41:32.860 --> 41:34.860
and then you can prove everything, right?

41:39.860 --> 41:44.860
You'd have all the theorems you ever could, conclusions perhaps I should say you'll ever need.

41:44.860 --> 41:47.860
So there's an interplay there,

41:47.860 --> 41:51.860
and so the whole thing may be a cheat, what I'm preaching.

41:51.860 --> 41:54.860
And that's a possibility that I'm afraid does occur to me.

41:56.860 --> 41:58.860
I want shortly to open up to questions,

41:58.860 --> 42:03.860
because I think that'll be a lot more interesting than me keep expounding on these things.

42:03.860 --> 42:06.860
But I do want to mention, maybe I know, let me do that.

42:06.860 --> 42:09.860
I have a coda that can come later.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.860
So let me stop now,

42:11.860 --> 42:15.860
and nobody is objected yet to anything I've said.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.860
Let's object or do something.

42:18.860 --> 42:20.860
No questions?

42:20.860 --> 42:22.860
Yeah, Zeldin.

42:22.860 --> 42:25.860
You mentioned mathematics is not arbitrary.

42:25.860 --> 42:26.860
Right.

42:26.860 --> 42:30.860
That's a slick description of the object that I'm now addressing you.

42:30.860 --> 42:34.860
Could you say, well, it's objected in some sense.

42:34.860 --> 42:39.860
So not arbitrary, but a little more like objected in some point or another.

42:39.860 --> 42:42.860
So the question is, for the record,

42:42.860 --> 42:44.860
what's this have to do with objectivity?

42:44.860 --> 42:46.860
I haven't the slightest idea.

42:46.860 --> 42:48.860
What does that mean in this context?

42:48.860 --> 42:53.860
It just means that now we can talk about mathematical truth and other things,

42:53.860 --> 42:58.860
similar to what we've talked about in the experiment last time.

42:58.860 --> 43:04.860
Truth, as opposed to having necessary conclusions.

43:04.860 --> 43:05.860
Exactly.

43:08.860 --> 43:11.860
It strikes me as a separate question.

43:11.860 --> 43:16.860
I think you're asking what's the validity of logic for something.

43:16.860 --> 43:23.860
I mean, is there some kind of a, I don't know, let's say, continuum hypothesis.

43:23.860 --> 43:32.860
Somehow, should we have a way which we would say is correct?

43:32.860 --> 43:37.860
Okay, I'm going to have to answer the question again for the record is,

43:37.860 --> 43:41.860
do I have anything to say about, say, the truth of the continuum hypothesis?

43:41.860 --> 43:42.860
Exactly.

43:42.860 --> 43:43.860
That would be an application.

43:43.860 --> 43:45.860
That would be a nice one.

43:45.860 --> 43:48.860
So let me expound just a bit on that.

43:48.860 --> 43:53.860
I have, as Zoltan surely knows, a view about the foundations of mathematics that may not,

43:53.860 --> 43:57.860
I think, is becoming standard over time.

43:57.860 --> 44:00.860
So let me just talk about this just for a moment.

44:00.860 --> 44:05.860
By and large, the practice of mathematics was remarkably free of foundations.

44:05.860 --> 44:09.860
The semantics of the subject matter for most mathematicians was irrelevant.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.860
They had a semantics.

44:12.860 --> 44:17.860
They felt they knew what they were talking about when they were talking about the natural numbers, for instance.

44:17.860 --> 44:23.860
Albeit, there were some areas that came up particularly in analysis roughly 100 years ago

44:23.860 --> 44:26.860
that seemed to be more complicated than that.

44:26.860 --> 44:30.860
When we came, and this turned out not to be mathematics,

44:30.860 --> 44:36.860
but when there arose a subject in which the semantics was not at all clear,

44:36.860 --> 44:41.860
namely computer science, set theory was found to be useless.

44:41.860 --> 44:45.860
And so we had to look entirely elsewhere for semantics,

44:45.860 --> 44:49.860
in which the continuum hypothesis appears to be totally irrelevant.

44:49.860 --> 44:52.860
Okay, so that's that first thing.

44:52.860 --> 45:01.860
Now, I was, as indicated in the introduction, in the business of building devices where you can vary.

45:01.860 --> 45:06.860
So I usually describe it as what happened to geometry in the 19th century,

45:06.860 --> 45:10.860
happened to foundations in the 20th century.

45:10.860 --> 45:12.860
You took a much more expansive view.

45:12.860 --> 45:14.860
It wasn't a single foundations.

45:14.860 --> 45:16.860
There were many foundations.

45:16.860 --> 45:20.860
You would pick the one that you wanted to make interesting theorems.

45:20.860 --> 45:24.860
So watch what happened.

45:24.860 --> 45:28.860
I mean, look what happened in the 19th century for geometry.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.860
It started, I think it's fair to say,

45:30.860 --> 45:33.860
it turns out you can find some earlier antecedents for this,

45:33.860 --> 45:38.860
but by and large it was the case that in the year 1800 there was Euclidean,

45:38.860 --> 45:39.860
they didn't need the word Euclidean.

45:39.860 --> 45:40.860
There was geometry.

45:40.860 --> 45:42.860
It's what we now call Euclidean geometry.

45:42.860 --> 45:44.860
You didn't have to worry about alternatives.

45:44.860 --> 45:47.860
In the middle of the century, people found that there were,

45:47.860 --> 45:50.860
wanted to explore alternative geometries.

45:50.860 --> 45:53.860
And by the end of the century, people no longer believe

45:53.860 --> 45:57.860
that the original one was describing this real world.

45:57.860 --> 46:01.860
Which I think I pointed out actually is a not a well posed question

46:01.860 --> 46:03.860
until you say which physics you're going to use

46:03.860 --> 46:06.860
to decide whether it's describing it or not.

46:06.860 --> 46:09.860
But now let me point out that Kant was essentially right,

46:09.860 --> 46:12.860
albeit not when it came to the specific things about

46:12.860 --> 46:16.860
the analyticity and synthetic and all that stuff.

46:16.860 --> 46:19.860
There was something special about Euclidean geometry.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.860
It was, in fact, it is.

46:21.860 --> 46:22.860
Let me use the present tense.

46:22.860 --> 46:26.860
It is less arbitrary than the other geometries.

46:26.860 --> 46:29.860
I don't think you have to say it's innate.

46:29.860 --> 46:35.860
I think it is simply the fact that it's reasonably clear to me

46:35.860 --> 46:37.860
that this may be peculiar.

46:37.860 --> 46:39.860
I may have trouble defending this,

46:39.860 --> 46:43.860
but to say that space is positively curved or negatively curved,

46:43.860 --> 46:45.860
they both sound like arbitrary decisions where to say

46:45.860 --> 46:48.860
it has no curvature, it all sounds unarbitrary.

46:48.860 --> 46:51.860
I do know that as a very young kid,

46:51.860 --> 46:55.860
a friend and I measured the circumference of a tree

46:55.860 --> 46:58.860
and wondered what the diameter was,

46:58.860 --> 47:03.860
and said, well, we took a little fruit juice glass

47:03.860 --> 47:05.860
and measured it there and saw it was about three to one,

47:05.860 --> 47:07.860
and we're happy with that answer.

47:07.860 --> 47:09.860
It never occurred to either of us,

47:09.860 --> 47:11.860
and we had to be told years later

47:11.860 --> 47:13.860
that we could have been living in a space

47:13.860 --> 47:16.860
in which that ratio between diameter and circumference

47:16.860 --> 47:20.860
was dependent on scale, that it wasn't constant.

47:20.860 --> 47:24.860
So that sounded arbitrary, right?

47:24.860 --> 47:26.860
Whereas sort of the neutral decision

47:26.860 --> 47:28.860
was to say that it's constant.

47:28.860 --> 47:30.860
And it seems to me there are a lot of things like that

47:30.860 --> 47:34.860
that tell you that classical geometry was the least arbitrary.

47:34.860 --> 47:38.860
If you had to settle on one, that would be it.

47:38.860 --> 47:40.860
I don't think it has to do with...

47:40.860 --> 47:42.860
Well, it's reasonably clear to me

47:42.860 --> 47:46.860
that if we lived in a space of non-zero curvature,

47:46.860 --> 47:49.860
we would build our blackboards to have zero curvature.

47:49.860 --> 47:51.860
We would need it to teach calculus.

47:51.860 --> 47:54.860
That's right.

47:54.860 --> 48:00.860
That requires a zero curvature plane.

48:00.860 --> 48:04.860
So back to the continuum hypothesis.

48:04.860 --> 48:07.860
I don't think it's a well-posed question, as stated.

48:07.860 --> 48:11.860
I think there is a non-arbitrary notion of a minimal set theory,

48:11.860 --> 48:14.860
which allows things like the axioms of ZF,

48:14.860 --> 48:16.860
and I'm willing to bet anybody

48:16.860 --> 48:20.860
that will eventually be shown to satisfy the continuum hypothesis.

48:20.860 --> 48:22.860
At that last, I'm not sure of,

48:22.860 --> 48:27.860
but I reasonably would expect it, I think.

48:27.860 --> 48:30.860
I'd put odds on it, put it that way.

48:30.860 --> 48:32.860
But you are making an arbitrary decision

48:32.860 --> 48:35.860
when you say, which set theory are you looking at?

48:35.860 --> 48:40.860
And so it is not an absolute question, as posed.

48:40.860 --> 48:43.860
It seems to me that the continuum hypothesis,

48:43.860 --> 48:46.860
you do need some other stuff you have to state

48:46.860 --> 48:49.860
to ask whether or not it's true.

48:50.860 --> 48:56.860
So these relationships in and out of the subject.

48:56.860 --> 49:00.860
So no, I'm not sure what I have to say about objectivity.

49:00.860 --> 49:03.860
I think you still will strive for non-arbitrary.

49:03.860 --> 49:05.860
And in fact, it would appear to,

49:05.860 --> 49:07.860
when you listen to the people in that business,

49:07.860 --> 49:12.860
as we had this conference on set theory last term,

49:12.860 --> 49:14.860
and in previous ones, people are looking for,

49:14.860 --> 49:18.860
if you look at it, are looking for non-arbitrary principles

49:18.860 --> 49:20.860
that would give you an answer.

49:20.860 --> 49:22.860
Because the continuum hypothesis, as it is,

49:22.860 --> 49:24.860
sounds too arbitrary.

49:24.860 --> 49:27.860
You have to say what it is you want your set theory to do

49:27.860 --> 49:29.860
before you're going to be able to answer the question.

49:29.860 --> 49:31.860
Yeah, yeah.

49:31.860 --> 49:35.860
So you can tell me as people that are skeptical

49:35.860 --> 49:36.860
about non-arbitrary.

49:36.860 --> 49:38.860
So when you first described it,

49:38.860 --> 49:40.860
it sounded like you had a theory about,

49:40.860 --> 49:41.860
you know, a goal versus chess,

49:41.860 --> 49:42.860
and it sounded like this,

49:42.860 --> 49:44.860
and I do symmetry and degeneracy and things like this.

49:44.860 --> 49:46.860
But now in response to Zoltan, you said,

49:46.860 --> 49:49.860
well, you certainly have the feeling of mess in us.

49:49.860 --> 49:51.860
But we know, you know, there's all these experiments

49:51.860 --> 49:54.860
that show, for example, most people find

49:54.860 --> 49:58.860
a risk between physics more natural than any physics.

49:58.860 --> 50:00.860
So if you show them, you know, a ball going through a pipe,

50:00.860 --> 50:02.860
or a water going through a pipe that's curved,

50:02.860 --> 50:04.860
they'll think it's going to keep being curved when it comes out.

50:04.860 --> 50:07.860
We know that people find teleological explanations

50:07.860 --> 50:11.860
more natural than they make realistic ones.

50:11.860 --> 50:13.860
So why trust our judgment about,

50:13.860 --> 50:16.860
I mean, we really come down to what we take to be natural.

50:16.860 --> 50:18.860
Why trust that this is relevant to the subject

50:18.860 --> 50:20.860
that we're talking about?

50:20.860 --> 50:22.860
I didn't use the word natural.

50:22.860 --> 50:24.860
I don't think...

50:29.860 --> 50:33.860
This real world is very arbitrary.

50:33.860 --> 50:34.860
So I guess I didn't say that.

50:34.860 --> 50:35.860
Perhaps I should have.

50:35.860 --> 50:38.860
When you talk about what's true in this particular world,

50:38.860 --> 50:40.860
that strikes me already as an arbitrary decision

50:40.860 --> 50:42.860
having been made.

50:43.860 --> 50:46.860
That at the moment is the difference between physics,

50:46.860 --> 50:51.860
the most clear difference between physics and mathematics,

50:51.860 --> 50:52.860
is precisely that.

50:52.860 --> 50:54.860
Physics is about a particular world

50:54.860 --> 50:58.860
in which you can do experiments and things like that.

50:58.860 --> 51:00.860
I said it's possible that physics will develop

51:00.860 --> 51:03.860
to a point where all the peculiarities of this real world,

51:03.860 --> 51:06.860
well, maybe not all, but a huge amount of them

51:06.860 --> 51:10.860
can be explained away as arbitrary, non-arbitrary.

51:13.860 --> 51:21.860
So yes, somebody better hold of what is meant by arbitrary.

51:21.860 --> 51:26.860
So this is work in process.

51:26.860 --> 51:29.860
In process, whatever the right word is there.

51:33.860 --> 51:36.860
The fact that the ordinary human brain

51:36.860 --> 51:38.860
has certain funny ways of doing it strikes me

51:38.860 --> 51:41.860
as an arbitrary fact about the nature of human brains

51:41.860 --> 51:43.860
more than that, so it doesn't bother me terribly.

51:43.860 --> 51:46.860
In fact, one can make a very good argument

51:46.860 --> 51:48.860
that most of the history of science

51:48.860 --> 51:50.860
is to refute common sense.

51:53.860 --> 51:59.860
But in doing so, you're trying to go by the folklore aspect of it.

51:59.860 --> 52:00.860
That's arbitrary.

52:00.860 --> 52:02.860
Whereas when it reaches by trying to use it

52:02.860 --> 52:04.860
based on some sort of experimental evidence,

52:04.860 --> 52:07.860
I think you're reaching there for less arbitrariness.

52:07.860 --> 52:09.860
But again, that's not mathematics.

52:12.860 --> 52:14.860
If you want to allow the possibility

52:14.860 --> 52:17.860
that there's another intelligent species somewhere

52:17.860 --> 52:20.860
that can include, their number theory will have different,

52:20.860 --> 52:22.860
some of their theorems and number theory

52:22.860 --> 52:25.860
will contradict our theorems and number theory,

52:25.860 --> 52:27.860
then I don't know what I could say to you.

52:27.860 --> 52:30.860
I mean, that is a possibility, I suppose.

52:30.860 --> 52:34.860
But I wouldn't consider it a realistic one.

52:34.860 --> 52:38.860
So that's not, I'm saying why I'm not answering the question.

52:39.860 --> 52:40.860
Yeah.

52:40.860 --> 52:41.860
I have a slightly different question

52:41.860 --> 52:42.860
towards that argument.

52:42.860 --> 52:44.860
So you started off saying mathematics is one way of thinking

52:44.860 --> 52:46.860
about mathematics as being non-arbitrary.

52:46.860 --> 52:48.860
So that's from sort of the data,

52:48.860 --> 52:51.860
sort of continuum of cases with like KS and Go.

52:51.860 --> 52:52.860
Right.

52:52.860 --> 52:54.860
So I guess the question now is,

52:54.860 --> 52:56.860
in my mind, is the boundary around mathematics,

52:56.860 --> 52:58.860
you know, how arbitrary counts as mathematics,

52:58.860 --> 53:00.860
is that arbitrary?

53:00.860 --> 53:01.860
Well, as I said.

53:01.860 --> 53:02.860
Where do we start?

53:02.860 --> 53:03.860
Where do we start with the game?

53:03.860 --> 53:04.860
No, no.

53:04.860 --> 53:05.860
There's no problems.

53:05.860 --> 53:08.860
If you forget about the necessity for theorems,

53:08.860 --> 53:11.860
then I pointed out you could go all the way to non-arbitrary

53:11.860 --> 53:12.860
and have no theorems.

53:12.860 --> 53:14.860
All the way to non-arbitrary.

53:14.860 --> 53:17.860
And then if you forget about the interest involved,

53:17.860 --> 53:19.860
you can do the same thing.

53:19.860 --> 53:23.860
Let me go back to chess and Go and whatnot.

53:23.860 --> 53:28.860
If you proved, this isn't precisely an answer to your question,

53:28.860 --> 53:32.860
but if somebody proved that, say,

53:32.860 --> 53:36.860
there was a strategy to win in chess for the first player,

53:36.860 --> 53:39.860
for white.

53:39.860 --> 53:42.860
And the fact that you could prove that existence

53:42.860 --> 53:44.860
doesn't mean that you could actually get hold of it, right?

53:44.860 --> 53:46.860
I mean, there are games that you can prove

53:46.860 --> 53:48.860
there's a strategy for one player or the other,

53:48.860 --> 53:51.860
and yet you have no idea what the strategy is.

53:51.860 --> 53:54.860
I don't think that would be considered a mathematical result.

53:54.860 --> 53:58.860
I don't think it would be considered a result in mathematics,

53:58.860 --> 54:01.860
in fact, in ordinary usage.

54:01.860 --> 54:05.860
Same with Go unless you remove the 19.

54:05.860 --> 54:09.860
If you had a theorem about Go which was for an arbitrary shape,

54:09.860 --> 54:13.860
well, I said shape there, let's start with a square board,

54:13.860 --> 54:15.860
but of arbitrary size.

54:15.860 --> 54:17.860
It would begin to sound more like mathematics,

54:17.860 --> 54:19.860
still not mathematics.

54:19.860 --> 54:23.860
If you then had a theorem about Go played on an arbitrary graph

54:23.860 --> 54:27.860
on a plane, and if you have the necessary and sufficient

54:27.860 --> 54:30.860
conditions, a nice statement of the necessary and sufficient

54:30.860 --> 54:34.860
conditions for that graph to determine who has a strategy.

54:34.860 --> 54:39.860
That, I think, would be accepted as a result in mathematics.

54:39.860 --> 54:42.860
Would we expect to do that for some kind of extra threshold

54:42.860 --> 54:45.860
and then we might properly division in the second place?

54:45.860 --> 54:46.860
Yeah.

54:46.860 --> 54:50.860
Yeah, I would.

54:50.860 --> 54:52.860
It's a hand that it wasn't.

54:52.860 --> 54:55.860
So again, I'm not sure if I'm answering your questions,

54:55.860 --> 54:59.860
but as I said, this is a work in progress or process,

54:59.860 --> 55:05.860
whichever word is relevant there.

55:05.860 --> 55:07.860
Is that a hand?

55:07.860 --> 55:09.860
Do I have to answer a question?

55:09.860 --> 55:10.860
Ask a question?

55:10.860 --> 55:11.860
Yeah.

55:11.860 --> 55:12.860
Very.

55:12.860 --> 55:14.860
Maybe I'm mishearing you, but there seem to be say,

55:14.860 --> 55:19.860
sorry, set of mathematics is defined by the questions you ask.

55:19.860 --> 55:21.860
I just said it was the theorems you end up with.

55:21.860 --> 55:22.860
Oh, OK.

55:22.860 --> 55:25.860
So, yes, I certainly am.

55:25.860 --> 55:28.860
I think that's unavoidable.

55:28.860 --> 55:31.860
I mean, I don't know a human endeavor, which isn't,

55:31.860 --> 55:34.860
intellectual endeavor, which isn't so defined.

55:34.860 --> 55:37.860
By the way, for the record, is mathematics defined by the questions

55:37.860 --> 55:38.860
that are asked?

55:38.860 --> 55:39.860
Yeah, of course.

55:39.860 --> 56:08.860
Yeah, the questions that pose themselves are the non-arbitrary ones.

56:08.860 --> 56:11.860
That's what makes them, that's how you know that they're posed,

56:11.860 --> 56:13.860
that they answer, that they pose themselves.

56:13.860 --> 56:16.860
It's because of their very non-arbitraryness.

56:16.860 --> 56:21.860
The questions we end up asking for practice, the finger exercises,

56:21.860 --> 56:26.860
those are arbitrary until we get to the really good questions.

56:26.860 --> 56:42.860
In theory.

56:42.860 --> 56:47.860
Of course, I wouldn't, in fact, I, well, OK, now,

56:47.860 --> 56:50.860
see, there's another huge problem,

56:50.860 --> 56:54.860
which I thought I would try to subsume by that notion of interest,

56:54.860 --> 56:57.860
maybe.

56:57.860 --> 57:01.860
You know, everything in mathematics is a totology.

57:01.860 --> 57:03.860
And that's not, of course, at all what we mean.

57:03.860 --> 57:05.860
That's a different subject.

57:05.860 --> 57:08.860
There is a huge difference between arbitrary totologies

57:08.860 --> 57:10.860
and the things that we call, maybe in theory,

57:10.860 --> 57:13.860
all the theorems are totologies.

57:13.860 --> 57:17.860
But not all totologies are theorems, right?

57:17.860 --> 57:21.860
So, yes, I mean, so let's take the example people usually point to,

57:21.860 --> 57:26.860
and that's the game invented, among others, by John Nash.

57:26.860 --> 57:30.860
In fact, by the way, just for the, just since we're on the subject,

57:30.860 --> 57:36.860
there is a scene in the movie where they don't say they're playing go.

57:36.860 --> 57:38.860
You're supposed to assume they're playing go.

57:38.860 --> 57:41.860
And Nash, the young Nash as a student at Princeton is upset

57:41.860 --> 57:44.860
because the first player should win.

57:44.860 --> 57:51.860
Now, it's, what's clear at the go board is it has far too many stones on it.

57:51.860 --> 57:57.860
So it can't be go, because serious go players would never still be playing

57:57.860 --> 58:00.860
without many stones left on the board.

58:00.860 --> 58:03.860
So I thought, oh, this is, that Nash must have,

58:03.860 --> 58:08.860
when Nash invented his game, which I won't try to describe here,

58:08.860 --> 58:12.860
he did play it on a go board, and he supplied the proof

58:12.860 --> 58:17.860
using some algebraic topology that there had to be a strategy for the first player.

58:17.860 --> 58:23.860
I actually got hold of the scriptwriters on that one, and I was wrong.

58:23.860 --> 58:28.860
They said they put that many stones on the go board because they looked nicer,

58:28.860 --> 58:32.860
and they said, but in fact they did film some other scenes

58:32.860 --> 58:36.860
in which Nash goes and invents the game of go, of Nash.

58:36.860 --> 58:42.860
And so they, I was wrong in my inference on it.

58:42.860 --> 58:45.860
Let me describe a game that's simpler to describe.

58:45.860 --> 58:48.860
In fact, you've all played it.

58:48.860 --> 58:54.860
It's Japanese name is Gomoku, and it's a wonderful pun there.

58:54.860 --> 58:57.860
The word go is the Japanese word for five.

58:57.860 --> 58:59.860
It is also the word for small stones.

58:59.860 --> 59:03.860
And it's, in the first case, it describes the standard game of go.

59:03.860 --> 59:07.860
This is a different game played with the same stones on the same board, right?

59:07.860 --> 59:09.860
And it's five in a row.

59:09.860 --> 59:13.860
You've all played it by every culture, I think, that's around to inventing that game.

59:13.860 --> 59:15.860
You play on a rectilinear grid.

59:15.860 --> 59:17.860
You don't have to specify the size.

59:17.860 --> 59:19.860
Take it to be unbounded size.

59:19.860 --> 59:23.860
And first player who gets five in a row of his color wins.

59:23.860 --> 59:25.860
This is one in which it's easy to prove.

59:25.860 --> 59:30.860
Sorry, chances are probably there's a strategy for both sides to draw.

59:30.860 --> 59:32.860
So let me be careful how I state this.

59:32.860 --> 59:36.860
It's easy to prove that there is no strategy for the second player to win.

59:36.860 --> 59:41.860
Because you have a little construction, you take any possible strategy for the second player to win,

59:41.860 --> 59:44.860
and you can quickly convert it into one for the first player to win.

59:44.860 --> 59:47.860
So therefore, there couldn't have been one for the second player to win.

59:47.860 --> 59:51.860
If you could supply the fact that the game must terminate,

59:51.860 --> 59:53.860
then you would have a strategy for the first player.

59:53.860 --> 59:55.860
The game of Nash has that nice feature.

59:55.860 --> 59:57.860
Again, because of a little algebraic topology,

59:57.860 --> 01:00:00.860
you know that there has to be a winner if they play long enough.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:05.860
And that's where the algebraic topology comes in.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.860
Notice there's nothing like an enumeration here.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.860
And therefore, these are mildly interesting theorems.

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:14.860
If they were obtained by enumeration, they wouldn't be interesting theorems.

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:19.860
So part of the word interest there has to do with the proof, the nature of the proof.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:28.860
And since, I mean, there should be someday a philosophy of the aesthetics of mathematics,

01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:33.860
the most people would ask, what's the word of aesthetics that mathematicians are most apt to use,

01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:35.860
say, well, the word is clearly elegant.

01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.860
Well, not true if you think about it.

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.860
The word is interesting.

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.860
You're using it so often, you don't even notice it as an aesthetic judgment.

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:48.860
And there are all sorts of theorems that are very interesting, which are totally inelegant,

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:54.860
because the interest will tend to come from the fact that they have a lot of nice corollaries,

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.860
and they tell you about a lot.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:01:00.860
And then there are a few things, like the theorem I just described, without going into the details,

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:06.860
in which the interest is very limited, but it has a nice, elegant little proof comes out.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:10.860
I mean, Nash as a student came up with.

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:16.860
By and large, if a speaker in mathematics starts with the fact that the theorem I'm going to prove

01:01:16.860 --> 01:01:23.860
isn't all that interesting, but the proof is interesting, you know that you might find an excuse to get out of the room.

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:28.860
This is usually a cop-out for not having an interesting theorem.

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:30.860
But this is a good part of it.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:38.860
So the complication coming in from this notion of interest is going to be a devious complication.

01:01:38.860 --> 01:01:41.860
It can rest on the nature of the proof.

01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:46.860
There are things that mathematicians, theorems that mathematicians in particular like to tell each other,

01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:50.860
and the theorems are uninteresting, but they have wonderful little proofs.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:55.860
And so this is a part of it.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:00.860
And as I say, it's one that I can only say, well, maybe this isn't even philosophical anymore.

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:06.860
Maybe aesthetic judgments themselves, the actual judgments, aren't part of philosophy.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.860
Yeah?

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.860
Not easy.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.860
Take some work.

01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:17.860
That's okay, right?

01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:20.860
I mean, but you quite right.

01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:25.860
It may not be anywhere near as arbitrary as we think, but you certainly in hell can strive for it.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:27.860
That's clear.

01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:36.860
So yes, if you want to, I would be willing to modify or put this in as a caveat that quite possibly is all terribly arbitrary.

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:41.860
But what you're trying to be as unarbitrary as possible.

01:02:41.860 --> 01:02:47.860
I don't, well, if I'm prepared to say that that is the same as non-arbitrary,

01:02:47.860 --> 01:02:50.860
now that's not what Platonism meant.

01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:53.860
So I don't think I need Platonism there.

01:02:53.860 --> 01:03:00.860
For the, I mean, the fact that mathematicians often become Platonists,

01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:08.860
it's the same phenomenon that a playwright, let's say, more, let me say scriptwriter rather than playwright,

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:14.860
often finds that the dialogue is writing itself, particularly if you're doing soap operas and things like that, right?

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.860
I mean, he's sitting there in the dialogues writing itself.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.860
They never fall into the trap of thinking therefore the characters exist.

01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:25.860
Mathematicians do.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:32.860
I mean, leave me, I do have a coda as it were.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:39.860
So let me just be, before we, let's stop the questioning a little bit before, ah, it's 20 of 6 already.

01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.860
Yeah, there was a hand up there.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:01.860
Well, for, okay, first of all, no, you can't.

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.860
I mean, nobody's got a good theorem proving program.

01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:06.860
There are profound problems there.

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:11.860
They're usually most understood to be or summarized by the phrase problem of equality.

01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:16.860
Mathematicians are constantly saying this is the same as that when they don't, when you don't, you know,

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:19.860
it's very nebulous what they're saying at that point.

01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:22.860
There are two uses of the word proof.

01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:32.860
When, when I say I can prove or let's be more accurate, Tarski proved that there is a proof that, um,

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.860
we have to be careful, Tarski didn't prove it.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:45.860
A corollary of what Tarski proved proves that there aren't any 16 dimensional division algebras

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.860
associative or not over the algebraic reels.

01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.860
Why? Because Tarski proved that that's a decidable theory,

01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:56.860
and the decisions only depend upon the definition of real closed field,

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.860
and it was proven for the real field using a lot of topology.

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.860
That's right. So, which wouldn't apply at all to the algebraic reels.

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:07.860
Okay, so the inner proof is a technical notion.

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:10.860
You find out, you notice that this is a first order statement and all that.

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:16.860
The outer thing, Tarski proved, that's the, that's the, the, the real notion, the, the public notion,

01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:19.860
or you're usually using, and we're nowhere near that.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:27.860
Um, I have this peculiar assertion that that proof, those proofs, the ones that live in real life,

01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:32.860
exist in fact only in their performance and what's written as a score thereof.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.860
And that's why, well, that's, that's a whole nother lecture.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:38.860
But, but, that's a very informal notion.

01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.860
So, in fact, the proofs we actually use to convince each other that, that proofs may exist.

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:46.860
Uh, yes, I would like to see a program doing something.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.860
I would like to see a machine develop a personnel.

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:51.860
I would like to see persons reciting in machines.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:56.860
I don't, I think they're of the same, they'll happen about the same time.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:01.860
I would guess that we'll have machines that can make us the same, similar aesthetic judgments

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.860
about theorems as humans that, when we have theorems that we recognize as persons,

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:08.860
when we have machines that we recognize as persons.

01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:13.860
Um, one, one more hand.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.860
Then I've got my coda, yeah.

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:24.860
You've anticipated my coda.

01:06:24.860 --> 01:06:29.860
I will not repeat the question for the record because it will sound like it's a total.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.860
Okay, so the coda is the following.

01:06:32.860 --> 01:06:36.860
There was a name, there was a name missing from that list.

01:06:37.860 --> 01:06:40.860
Um, that I started with.

01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:45.860
There was a philosopher, professor of philosophy at Brown University named John Ladd.

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:50.860
Over the years, I've met a remarkable number of people who were strongly influenced by John Ladd

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:53.860
in all sorts of subjects, by the way.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.860
I never took a course from him.

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.860
Uh, never really sat at his feet.

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:01.860
But he, I was one of many that he had a something of a good influence on.

01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:05.860
I think the second week I was at Brown,

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:09.860
he sat down next to me, he was chief resident fellow,

01:07:09.860 --> 01:07:17.860
and he considered it part of his job to eat lunch with the students in the big dining room we all ate lunch in

01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:19.860
in those days.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:23.860
Uh, and so he sat down next to me.

01:07:23.860 --> 01:07:31.860
Now, I, I begin by talking about, we have, we have to find ways to explain to other people what it is that

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.860
mathematicians do.

01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:35.860
Philosophers have to do the same thing, of course.

01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:41.860
Uh, there's a huge difference between the public view of, well, if you, I did an inadvertent experiment years ago,

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:46.860
which I've repeated a number of times, say to the first time it was with some high school students,

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:54.860
and I was casually mentioned a philosopher I knew, I said a professional, professional philosopher,

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.860
and that phrase got a rise, professional philosopher.

01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:59.860
How could there be such things, right?

01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.860
I mean, they were aware of some great philosophers, but you know a, you know, that same sort of thing.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:16.860
And I think, uh, so let's see, by the time I was a freshman, I think I had some awareness that professors of philosophy wrote papers,

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:23.860
and as far as I could tell, though, all they did was refute other philosophers.

01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:25.860
And so I said that.

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:34.860
What I said to him was, what's it like being a member of a profession in which your reputation rests on your ability to refute others?

01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:41.860
And he proceeded to tell me about synthesis and tithesis, I should say, thesis and tithesis and synthesis,

01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:49.860
taking as his main example Thomas, synthesizing essentially the Greek thought and the Christian thought.

01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:55.860
Um, well, that's just the beginning of the story.

01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:00.860
Some weeks later, but again, it was my first semester at Brown.

01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:06.860
Also at lunch, but a more formal occasion, I find myself sitting next to someone.

01:09:06.860 --> 01:09:09.860
No, I don't know who it was.

01:09:09.860 --> 01:09:11.860
I didn't know who it was even the next day.

01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:14.860
I don't think I ever saw him again.

01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.860
I'm assuming he was a philosopher.

01:09:17.860 --> 01:09:25.860
To make conversation with me, he said, what do you think about logicism and formalism and intuitionism?

01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:32.860
And I said, oh, I think they should be synthesized.

01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:36.860
And he immediately got a different expression on his face.

01:09:36.860 --> 01:09:42.860
He actually started, you know, maybe I should listen to this person's sort of expression.

01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:45.860
And he said, that's very interesting.

01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:49.860
And there was a quietness.

01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:54.860
I mean, I was supposed to say something and so, I didn't know really what the words meant.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:10:00.860
I think I had heard the words and I had some very vague idea of what they referred to.

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:09.860
But I did know that in the 19th century, they had learned to model these different kinds of geometry in each other.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:18.860
So I said, well, I said, surely we will learn to reduce each of them to any of the other two, right?

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:25.860
I mean, so any question of one can be translated into a question in the other.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:38.860
Yeah, I mean, it turns out that to make that process easy turned out to be a good hunk of the research of Alex of Andre Shedroff and I.

01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:44.860
Just to do that sort of thing.

01:10:44.860 --> 01:10:46.860
But I didn't know that then.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:50.860
But then I did say, I only recently remembered all this again.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:55.860
I mean, I didn't remember it over and over the years.

01:10:55.860 --> 01:11:02.860
I said, of course, when you translate a question from one place to the other, it can look quite different.

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:07.860
And in fact, if you didn't know what the original question is, it wouldn't look interesting.

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:17.860
And so I said, but of course, that shows you that the real issue is what do you find interesting?

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:20.860
I'd forgotten temporarily this for you.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:28.860
So in other words, I've just come back to where I was at the age of, I mean, the first freshman year, which also, of course, might mean that I didn't come back to it.

01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:31.860
It was always there and this is biased my whole approach, right?

01:11:31.860 --> 01:11:42.860
But I'm prepared, at least for the near future, to continue to defend the principle that finally what we really have to do is say, what do we find interesting and why?

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:46.860
And that should be the rest of the subject of mathematics.

01:11:46.860 --> 01:11:48.860
I guess that's the end.

01:11:48.860 --> 01:11:50.860
Thank you.

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.860
Good.

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.860
Center time.
