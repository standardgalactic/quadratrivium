0	9480	So, on behalf of the School of Arts and Sciences and Penn Engineering, I am very pleased to
9480	15460	welcome you to the seventh annual Thomas and Yvonne Williams Lecture for the Advancement
15460	17880	of Logic and Philosophy.
17880	24120	We are most grateful for the generosity and vision that Tom and Yvonne have shown in establishing
24120	29660	the fund that supports this series of lectures and that makes possible other educational
29660	35620	activities at the university and at upper schools in our region.
35620	41020	It was a great pleasure to work with Tom when I first arrived at Penn and to watch him develop
41020	47140	through the study of Logic and Philosophy that clarity of mind which he has so successfully
47140	53620	brought to bear in the sphere of practical affairs and that sustains his ongoing passion
53620	56100	for the life of the mind.
56100	61060	And it remains a great pleasure to work with him now on a range of activities that will
61060	68140	advance a general appreciation of the power of reason to clarify problems both practical
68140	70380	and theoretical.
70380	76060	I am delighted to introduce this year's Williams Lecturer, Peter Fried.
76060	81020	Peter is an internationally renowned expert on category theory and its applications in
81020	82940	computer science.
82940	89380	He pioneered the development of Topos theory and its use in articulating precise semantics
89380	91980	for programming languages.
91980	99980	In 2010, he was awarded the Lix Test of Time Award for his 1990 paper, Recursive Types
99980	103140	Reduced to Inductive Types.
103140	108980	Peter is professor of mathematics and of computer and information science here at Penn.
108980	116140	He has played a leading role in the university's logic and computation group since its inception.
116140	124180	His deep insights and fierce intellectual honesty have inspired the group for many years.
124180	130580	Please join me in warmly welcoming Peter Fried who will speak to us about an anti-philosophy
130580	140700	of mathematics.
140700	143900	I received an email which is what I want to show you.
143900	147900	The author refused to let me use his name.
147900	152780	I will be talking about an anti-philosophy of mathematics but that's just one tiny thing
152780	158740	compared with other things which are more in the realm of philosophy of mathematics.
158900	162540	You will also hear that I have some things to say about anti-philosophies maybe of some
162540	164500	other subjects.
164500	171060	But I have to say this list of people, the first four names are from Brown University.
171060	175780	By the way, there are names that are there that shouldn't be and some that shouldn't
175780	180260	be but aren't and there are names that aren't there that shouldn't be.
180260	181260	That's the very first one.
181260	186980	Kurt Dukas, is that name still a name to contend with in the world of philosophy?
186980	192380	He was well known in his day and I'm afraid that when I knew him, he was the grand old
192380	199860	man of the Brown Philosophy Department, meaning he was about a year younger than I am now.
199860	210220	His subject I'm afraid was a paranormal phenomena and I never sat at his feet.
210220	218380	It wasn't until years later, like maybe ten years ago, that I find out that this is the
218380	224220	founder of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, the first president of the Association of Symbolic
224220	226580	Logic.
226580	229100	There was no trace of that when I knew him.
229100	235980	The next three are people from whom I took graduate courses in philosophy at Brown.
235980	243700	Leslie Salmon has gone, I mean he was then something of a logician.
243700	246500	He's progressed beyond that since.
246500	248820	Stefan Koerner from England was there for just a year.
248820	252580	It was essentially the beginning of his interest in the philosophy of mathematics.
252580	259740	There were three, as I say, three, when I said graduate courses, they were in fact all seminars.
259740	261860	Archism was the important one.
261860	265860	He did have a strong influence on me over the years.
265860	268500	I do have a copy of this.
268500	272060	Oh, I've got one right here.
272060	274980	Carl Hemple doesn't belong there.
274980	278540	This now starts with a few names from Princeton.
278540	280500	I had very little contact with him.
280500	287180	Alonzo Church, the mystery to me about Alonzo Church is why he insisted I wasn't able to
287300	291740	effest for his retirement.
291740	297420	I finally received word years later, I mean I did listen to him occasionally, but I certainly
297420	300340	never sat at his feet.
300340	307300	Years later I found out from an organizer that he not only once made me, I made him
307300	313500	laugh out loud, I did it twice and he thought that this was a remarkable achievement and
313500	320100	therefore I should.
320100	323620	Kurt Gertl, I never really had, but maybe the time will come.
323620	328580	In fact, a number of the names now, mysteriously enough, even though I first met them or talked
328580	331300	to them somewhere else, re-emerge as important figures.
331300	336620	I have two microphones here at the moment.
336620	339620	Here with connection with Penn, now there's a long story.
339620	344140	When I received this email and looked at it, I realized that a whole bunch of stories
344140	355140	to tell you about Penn in philosophy in the 1960s and nobody's left except me and to some
355140	360460	good extent Eriven, who was attending about as many philosophy colloquy as I was, meaning
360460	362500	all of them actually.
362500	369500	Eriven has been at Penn since 1954 and was on the member of the faculty since 1961.
369500	372580	I came in 62.
372580	375940	If this were a year earlier, I could say that Jim Ross is part of that crowd.
375940	379740	He also came in 62 and we attended the same graduate seminars.
379740	382620	I should make that inclusion the right way.
382620	389940	He attended the same graduate seminars that I did at Brown.
389940	394420	Ernest Nagel, I talked to a bit at Columbia, but again, he comes up in connection with Penn.
394420	396780	Now we come to the Penn part.
396780	399820	We're represented actually by just a few names.
399820	403260	Let me go back to 1962.
403260	408300	It was a seller's market in those days, meaning that when you went to a math meeting, people
408300	412180	started offering you jobs before they even knew your name.
412180	417620	That's literally the correct.
417620	425500	I agreed to come down to Penn as a favor to a young person in the faculty whom I knew.
425500	428980	They did a sales job on me.
428980	430580	Penn was in a state of receivership.
430580	431820	That's not my word.
431820	432820	That is my word.
432820	433820	Sorry, it's not there.
433820	438620	There was a receivership committee chaired, if I'm pretty sure, by Britt Chance.
438620	442460	Is that right, Murray?
442460	445820	Was Britt Chance the chair of the receivership committee for mathematics?
445820	447060	You think about it.
447060	455380	There was only one mathematician on the committee and they wanted to rebuild mathematics at Penn.
455380	459780	They seemed to have what they considered a lot of money, and they insisted that I could
459780	464860	build a department at Penn that I was 26 years old at that point.
464860	466820	Actually they talked me into coming up.
466820	471380	Penn's status in the Ivy League in those days was quite iffy.
471380	477860	The phrase you would see in a number of publications was that Penn was de classe.
477860	479980	How much of this is known anymore?
479980	483780	Penn started, of course, as a football league, hence the word league.
484780	488060	The Ivy League started as a football league.
488060	490180	Penn had moved away from it.
490180	494140	It was often considered the 11th Big Ten.
494140	498820	The 11th Big Ten finally did come into formal existence and it turned out to be Penn State,
498820	501700	but that's a different matter.
501700	506820	Somewhere along the line, just a few years earlier, fortunately for all of us here, the
506820	514180	university decided to renew its Ivy League football league status, which meant that they
514180	516780	had to go along with all those rules.
516780	520420	This has clearly had a tremendously good effect.
520420	525100	It also gave Penn something of an advantage in hiring people.
525100	527340	I did come.
527340	528420	Now let's go back a bit.
528420	531180	What was Penn known for in those days?
531180	535380	I knew that it had a good medical division.
535380	540700	Beyond that, it had four departments, just four.
540700	545940	Anthropology, archaeology, they had been the best departments essentially in their subject
545940	549660	from essentially the beginning.
549660	554140	Linguistics and Nelson Goodman.
554140	557020	That was it, meaning the philosophy department.
557020	558300	I arrive here and guess what?
558300	561620	Nelson Goodman isn't here.
561620	562620	He was on leave.
562620	564420	He was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
564420	567020	It was clear that he had some very attractive offers, at least one.
567020	569500	I'm not sure how many he actually had.
569500	574900	A chairman had been hired away from the University of Buffalo.
574900	576860	Marvin Farber.
576860	578060	He should not be in this list.
578060	579620	I certainly never sat at his feet.
579620	581180	You'll hear quite the opposite in a moment.
581180	585980	Well, he didn't sit at my feet, that's for sure.
585980	591900	As it was with Ducasse, I was flabbergasted to learn later some aspects about Marvin Farber,
591900	596380	such as the fact that he was, quote, and I'm quoting directly from the literature, a protégé
596380	598260	of Zermelo.
598260	600780	I learned that within the last week.
600780	605020	That's absolutely flabbergasting to me.
605020	613060	At those days, the University was run from the faculty club bar starting about five o'clock.
613060	617380	The provost would arrive, fantastically good provost, David Goddard.
617380	620820	You could do a lot of business if you were willing to go to the faculty club bar at that
620820	621820	hour.
621820	626180	I found myself there one evening, sitting at a table with the provost on one side, the
626180	632100	dean of the, what they then called the dean of the college, and the other side, Otto Springer.
632100	634300	His subject was German.
634300	640100	The dean told the provost that much to his surprise, the department didn't want to keep
640100	643060	Nelson Goodman.
643060	644700	I didn't say a word.
644700	646980	I thought I'd better check.
646980	648140	I'd been going to Colloquy.
648140	651540	I knew a good part of the department at that point.
651540	655260	The next morning at about 8.30 in the morning in the provost's office, outer office, there
655260	656340	was a crowd of us.
656340	659780	I was the one nonmember of the department.
659780	660780	Marvin Farber had lied.
660780	662980	It was a straight out and out lie.
662980	666940	He thought, why he thought he could get by with it is beyond my comprehension.
666940	672380	We went into the provost's office for some reason, I guess precisely because I was the
672380	674700	one nonmember of the department.
674700	680940	People turned to me and I said, good boy, I said, we're here to recommend a university
680940	684260	professorship for Nelson Goodman.
684260	685260	That worked.
685260	690100	He came back the next year, but only for one year he eventually did go back to Cambridge.
690100	693220	But I was a, as I said, I was attending all the colloquy.
693220	699740	I gave a number of colloquy in those years.
699740	706540	And a receivership committee, again, not their word, my word, was set up under the
706540	713580	chairmanship of the dean of the graduate school, Roy Nichols, historian.
713580	717260	The very first meeting I was there, there was one philosopher, Joseph Clark, if that
717260	722620	means Francis Clark, sorry, if that means anything to anybody, who never said a word
722660	725140	in the entire history of that committee.
725140	730980	On the opening day of the committee, the chairman said, of course we're going to go
730980	731980	very slowly here.
731980	735500	We're not going to make any rapid decisions.
735500	741420	An hour later, the committee unanimously voted that we should make every effort to get Hao
741420	744700	Wang to come to Penn.
744700	749500	I was aware that Wang was movable for some family or personal reason from Harvard.
749500	751940	And he damn near came, by the way.
751940	757580	Rockefeller University got him from us at the end.
757580	765900	But then I was hiring, at the age of 26, I was hiring people for temporary, well, yes,
765900	766900	I was.
766900	767900	I was hiring young people, actually.
767900	773780	And the next name, Stanley Tenenbaum, is a part of that list.
773780	777940	He was sane at that point.
777940	782780	The next few years, we did see Paul Bernays, and now an interesting sequence of people
782780	787220	who aren't on this list somehow were around here at Penn.
787220	789300	One was John Mayhill.
789300	793820	He was being kept alive, and that's literally the case, not by the philosophy department,
793820	797500	but the computer scientists.
797500	802940	That was, the computer science department didn't officially exist until 1972, but there
802940	810740	was a graduate group in computer science.
810740	812140	Mario Boonga was here.
812140	819020	Now, I didn't have anything to do with that, but he was here.
819020	827220	And at least from that, if I didn't sit at his feet, I at least got my first PhD student,
827220	828220	namely his wife.
829220	833260	Well, anyway, no, it's not a hoax, but it's not the way it appears.
833260	841100	I do want to talk about a philosophy, a possible philosophy for mathematics, and so now I get
841100	844540	a bit more serious.
844540	849220	So by the way, just before I leave it, as I said, as far as I can tell, only one person
849220	854500	left who was actually part of that receivership committee and all that sort of thing.
854500	856900	Well, that I know for sure.
857900	864260	It's a strange, weird little piece of history that you had a philosophy department a few
864260	870540	years earlier, had an international renown in which a 26-year-old, two years out of his
870540	875860	own PhD was hiring people from the philosophy department.
875860	880700	Well, Jim Ross became chairman, and the rest is history.
880700	886460	By the way, the first person presently here to come after that was Charles Kahn.
887180	888900	That was 1964.
892780	900340	So, yes, so as any mathematician knows, if you're going to talk about something you need
900340	906420	a definition, as just about every philosopher knows, if you're lucky, you'll end up with
906420	911620	definitions, not start out with them, and that, of course, is the case with mathematics,
911620	915380	and there's the central question, how in hell do you define mathematics?
915380	917020	And I want to start there.
919660	926740	It was, there's an informal reason for wanting something like a definition, as you all know,
926740	930940	that you try to communicate to people who aren't mathematicians what it is that mathematicians
930940	932940	do.
932940	937820	And I was, and so I wouldn't consider this to be anything serious, but it was just effort
937820	940180	of communication.
940180	945460	If I'm in the right mood, I found over the years, if you want an interesting time, casually
945460	951740	say that, oh, you invent mathematics and watch the reaction, but if you're not in the mood
951740	957060	for that, that you have to be in a special mood for.
957060	963380	You want to communicate that mathematics is a subject matter, that it's not just a body
963380	969420	of techniques, so one wants to distinguish between mathematics on one hand and the mathematical
969420	976020	on the other hand, albeit mathematics presumably is one of the mathematical subjects.
976020	982100	And in that process, I find, I found myself saying like things, it is a subject matter.
982100	987140	I would use the phrase, it is about something.
987140	996380	1969, the summertime, in the city of Brunswick, Maine, I was saying that to a group of people.
996380	1001820	And another mathematician, now dead, named John Isbill, interrupted me and said, I don't
1001820	1008540	know if it's about something, but I do know that it's not arbitrary.
1008540	1011140	And he instantly stopped me.
1011140	1015380	Now John didn't want to go so far as to say that you could define that mathematics.
1015380	1017620	You could use that to define mathematics.
1017620	1022300	I'm not sure if you can, as you'll hear that we have to keep poking the definition to get
1022300	1024820	something that actually works.
1024820	1030380	But the way I first wanted to phrase it was, if there were a word in English that stood
1030380	1036500	as the opposite of arbitrary, I could use that word to say what mathematics was, what
1036500	1039740	the subject matter of mathematics was.
1039740	1044860	And in fact, English may have that word, the word may be mathematics.
1044860	1046260	And there's a lot that stems from this.
1046260	1052620	I mean, you can proceed, in fact, in the next half hour or so, I will try to give some examples
1052620	1059380	of answering some typical questions, such as, for instance, the unreasonable effectiveness
1059380	1067300	of mathematics to use Wigner's wonderful title of his paper.
1067300	1069020	But now let me jump right now.
1069020	1072980	This isn't all I have to say about it, but where this notion of anti-philosophy comes
1072980	1073980	from.
1073980	1080220	There's the possibility, if that's the case, that mathematics is that which is least arbitrary,
1080460	1088740	when you ask the question, what is the meaning of a sentence in mathematics, you're asking
1088740	1094540	for something, if you think about it, necessarily more arbitrary than mathematics.
1094540	1097940	And therefore, it may not be a well-posed question.
1097940	1102980	Now, there are many anti-philosophies in this sense of the word, meaning, in fact, I've
1102980	1106740	been predicting for years that somebody is going to come along and prove a girdle-like
1106780	1115380	theorem to the effect that any language sufficiently rich, that to be defined, necessarily allows
1115380	1123140	you to ask questions which don't have any conceivable answer, but sound as if they should.
1123140	1126820	We're used to that in a number of special cases.
1126820	1132620	We're used, for instance, in mathematics, except this is a very applied mathematics,
1132660	1138340	to know that to ask what frequencies are present in a signal at a given instance, it just doesn't
1138340	1139340	make sense.
1139340	1142740	You can't, I mean, the definition of frequency or how you would measure it is such that you
1142740	1148620	can't ask that question without specifying a non-zero interval.
1148620	1154260	And this indeterminacy between time and frequency, of course, can be used to explain just about
1154260	1157380	all the physical indeterminacies.
1157380	1160900	Or some other ones, for instance, the curvature of space.
1160900	1166500	To ask what's the curvature of space, you can't expect to get an answer unless you
1166500	1170020	start talking about how you're going to use physics to measure it.
1170020	1173620	So you need to know the physics you're assuming in order to answer the question, what's the
1173620	1178460	curvature of space, meaning real space, the space we live in.
1178460	1184820	And there are a whole bunch of things like that that we're already used to.
1184820	1190100	There's one which I like to throw at mathematicians as an example.
1190100	1194000	But I warn you, people can get very upset at this one.
1194000	1198900	If somebody takes set theory as a serious foundational language for mathematics, I can
1198900	1204300	pose to him, because of its untyped nature, the question, are there any simple groups
1204300	1207180	that appear as zeros of the zeta function?
1207180	1209660	I've seen people get very angry at this.
1209660	1211980	I've seen people forget why I mentioned it.
1212420	1213380	I didn't really ask it.
1213380	1214260	I only mentioned it.
1217260	1222340	I've had people come back to me two weeks later swearing at me for bringing up such
1222340	1223980	an absurd question.
1223980	1226860	Okay, that's transparently absurd.
1226860	1229900	Notice, by the way, you have no way of answering it at all, even if you took it for
1229900	1234580	the moment seriously, until you specify what definition of group you have in mind and
1234580	1237660	what definition of complex number.
1237660	1241540	And then after somebody specifies them, I've challenged people, now proved to me that
1241580	1243420	there aren't any simple groups that he's got.
1246420	1247940	Look, as I say, there are a lot of these.
1247940	1252660	And one of them may be, one of these questions I'm suggesting may be,
1252660	1256140	what is the meaning of a mathematical sentence?
1256140	1257100	Well, let me come back to that.
1259540	1261780	But that's the only thing that anti-philosophy means there.
1264140	1269460	The idea that the non-arbitraryness of mathematics might be its defining characteristic.
1270460	1274500	Maybe, I'm not sure about defining characteristic, but it's certainly an important aspect that
1274500	1277460	of it, of course, has been anticipated any number of times.
1277460	1282460	Indeed, the most famous definition of mathematics that exists is right here.
1283460	1284500	See if I can scale it down.
1285940	1286860	I can't scale it down.
1287860	1288460	Can I move it?
1291860	1292820	There we go, let's see.
1293940	1296860	I seem not to be able to scale that down, or now it's too small.
1296860	1298020	Leave it like that.
1298020	1298900	Leave it like this, okay.
1300460	1303860	You notice that, except it's not there.
1307860	1309900	There must have been an easier way of doing this.
1309900	1313060	Anyway, it's mathematics is the science which draws necessary conclusions.
1313060	1314060	Why is it in handwriting?
1315060	1317380	Okay, another little story about Penn from the 60s.
1318380	1320060	In fact, this is 1962.
1320060	1323460	The graduate students in the math department came to me with this funny looking book.
1323460	1324900	It was about this size, very thin.
1325980	1329060	And each page looked like this, except for the title page.
1330060	1333060	The damn thing was hand lithographed.
1334700	1338460	It turns out from a single lithograph stone that they kept cleaning for
1338460	1340860	the next 100 copies, there are only 100 editions.
1342460	1346700	This is the first publication, official publication of the National Academy of
1346700	1349260	Sciences that hadn't been founded that much earlier.
1350860	1354460	It was finally, I think, appeared around 1872.
1354460	1355860	The lecture was 1870.
1356860	1358860	And it is the book and title.
1358860	1360260	The title is there visible here.
1361260	1363060	A Linear Associate of Algebra.
1363060	1364460	Let me just talk about it for a moment.
1364460	1366260	It doesn't really have anything to do with the philosophy.
1366260	1370460	But it's fascinating that this book was just stacked in the,
1370460	1375060	appeared in the stacks at the Penn Library one floor down.
1375060	1378860	I actually kept it in my house for a year, enjoyed showing it to people.
1378860	1381860	And wondering if they'd ever noticed that it was missing.
1381860	1382860	They never did.
1383860	1390860	I took it to the rare books side of the library where it still resides,
1390860	1391860	I'm pretty sure.
1392860	1394860	As far as I could tell in the last week,
1394860	1398860	I can find no evidence that any copy of it has ever been sold, amazingly.
1399860	1403860	Apparently, at least there isn't any record of any, so nobody knows the value of it.
1405860	1408860	Benjamin Purse's son, I haven't given the name yet, have I?
1413860	1414860	I can't.
1415860	1417860	Unfortunately, I have no control over here.
1417860	1420860	There are other pages I could look at, but I can't at the moment.
1422860	1423860	Benjamin Purse.
1423860	1426860	So since his name isn't here, let me at least write it.
1426860	1428860	And indeed, this is about the end of it.
1430860	1432860	This was the only thing I wanted this for.
1432860	1436860	So why don't we kill this and get rid of the screens?
1439860	1440860	No, it didn't work.
1440860	1442860	Turn off left projector.
1442860	1443860	Turn off right projector.
1446860	1447860	And let's take these down.
1448860	1449860	Let's take them up.
1449860	1452860	I used to think I only had left, right confusion.
1461860	1463860	I am not misspelling it.
1464860	1473860	I once had two signed recommendations on my desk, both from Harvard Purse instructors,
1473860	1476860	both of whom thought that they were Pierce instructors.
1476860	1479860	Next time I saw Barry Mazer, in fact, he was that.
1479860	1480860	I said, here, I've got to show you these.
1480860	1481860	He said, I don't want to see.
1481860	1482860	I've given up.
1482860	1484860	You can't do it.
1484860	1486860	The name is spelled that way, and it is Purse.
1486860	1491860	The book, which I was just showing is, by the way, for the mathematicians in the crowd,
1491860	1497860	is the first known instance of such words as it impotent, neopotent.
1497860	1499860	The person's decomposition is there.
1499860	1502860	Of course, he doesn't give it a name.
1502860	1508860	It is commonly said to be the first book in mathematics ever published in America.
1508860	1514860	His son, far better known than Benjamin Charles Sanders, got it reprinted about 10 years later
1514860	1518860	after his father had died, and then, in fact, put it into a book form made a number of changes
1518860	1522860	where it did gain some frequency, particularly in Europe.
1522860	1530860	I've even seen the statement that it is the first work in science to come out of the United States,
1530860	1538860	which meant that whoever wrote that hadn't heard of Benjamin Franklin, but that's a different issue.
1538860	1543860	There was a wonderful period when I could go around, and then the question became too well-known,
1543860	1547860	and I really enjoyed doing this with electrical engineers in this building,
1547860	1552860	and I'd say, who's the greatest electrical engineer ever associated with Penn?
1552860	1553860	And they wouldn't know.
1553860	1558860	And, of course, it was the inventor of the lightning rod and the words positive and negative
1558860	1561860	and conductance and resistance and all those words.
1561860	1563860	So, sorry.
1563860	1567860	Go on here.
1567860	1569860	Where was I?
1569860	1573860	Oh, just how the first book came in, but where was I?
1573860	1575860	I've lost track of what I was saying.
1575860	1579860	There's his name, at least.
1579860	1581860	That book, that sentence, rather.
1581860	1583860	I had no idea it was in that book.
1583860	1584860	That sentence.
1584860	1586860	Oh, let me say a little bit more about this.
1586860	1587860	Sorry about that book.
1587860	1592860	It's fascinating because Benjamin Purse did have a lot to say about the philosophy of mathematics,
1592860	1597860	and his book is a counter-example to almost everything he said.
1597860	1603860	He amazingly was dedicated to applied mathematicians, mathematics.
1603860	1606860	This book, the linear associative algebra, I should tell you,
1606860	1613860	classified all associative algebras over the reels up to dimension six.
1613860	1615860	It created a subject.
1615860	1616860	Well, not quite the subject.
1616860	1619860	It may be in that generality it created it.
1619860	1623860	And it's the only thing that he did that was, the only important thing that he did that was actually
1623860	1626860	in pure mathematics as opposed to applied mathematics.
1627860	1636860	Quite remarkable how that work, which has his most famous single statement about the nature of mathematics,
1636860	1641860	was in fact a counter-example to his philosophy of mathematics.
1641860	1646860	Now, there's a word in that line, which I want to take quite seriously.
1646860	1648860	Let me pause for a moment.
1648860	1651860	Gratton Guinness has published a very nice history of the work.
1651860	1653860	He got hold of some original manuscripts and whatnot.
1653860	1657860	And the word necessary comes in quite late.
1657860	1664860	For a while, it was mathematics is the subject which draws conclusions,
1664860	1666860	tried inferences, a few other things.
1666860	1673860	And apparently from some correspondence, he was troubled by the fact that the same thing could be said about law.
1673860	1676860	So he decided to put the word necessary in there.
1676860	1679860	Word necessary is not the same as arbitrary.
1679860	1682860	And in fact, of course, the words are different.
1682860	1685860	But in fact, it's easy to find counter-examples in each direction.
1685860	1686860	But it's similar.
1686860	1688860	It's in that nature.
1688860	1693860	But the more important word from my point of view is the word conclusions.
1693860	1696860	Because without theorems, there's no mathematics.
1696860	1699860	And so that has to be added to the mix.
1699860	1702860	It's not enough to say you're non-arbitrary.
1702860	1705860	You also have to have theorems.
1705860	1708860	So let me give an outrageous example.
1708860	1714860	If you want a lot of theorems, sorry, the other way,
1714860	1719860	if you want a lot of non-arbitraryness, just start with an empty theory, right?
1719860	1721860	And then you're totally non-arbitrary.
1721860	1723860	You don't have to worry about anything.
1723860	1728860	So clearly you have to have some criterion for having theorems.
1728860	1730860	Couple that in.
1730860	1734860	The existence of theorems in the non-arbitraryness.
1734860	1740860	I don't think there's a huge mystery about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.
1740860	1745860	First of all, it's worth noting that very small part of mathematics, I think,
1745860	1747860	ever finds an application.
1747860	1749860	See, there's a problem of perception here.
1749860	1753860	There's all sorts of areas of mathematics we've now totally forgotten about
1753860	1757860	because they've stopped doing theorems and they never found an application.
1758860	1764860	So one which I like to take as an example is finite geometry.
1764860	1767860	Finite projective planes, for instance.
1767860	1772860	I don't think anybody has ever talked about a conceivable application for that subject.
1772860	1778860	The last, with one exception, the last theorem was proven probably well over 100 years ago.
1778860	1784860	The big question is, why is it that all finite projective planes have prime power order?
1784860	1786860	That's a matter of observation.
1786860	1788860	Nobody's found a counter example.
1788860	1793860	Since I am talking about, let me say, the one exception was that about 20 years ago,
1793860	1798860	they did prove that there are no projective planes of order 10.
1798860	1801860	Six is easy, comparatively.
1801860	1804860	10 is, took one hell of a lot of work.
1804860	1806860	Tremendous amount of computer time.
1806860	1808860	I have a personal story.
1808860	1814860	I was having breakfast at John Thompson's place in, it was a Sunday morning in Cambridge
1814860	1816860	when, what's his first name?
1816860	1819860	He pronounces it McCoy, spells it McKay.
1819860	1825860	John McCoy came with a wonderful news that because of a lot of work of John Thompson,
1825860	1829860	they had reduced the question down to something that wouldn't cost more in computer time
1829860	1831860	than it had cost to get a man in the moon.
1831860	1835860	And so therefore one knows that we could do it, right?
1835860	1838860	In the next 10 years or so, actually it was about eight years,
1838860	1843860	the improvement of computers and the improvement of the method for search got down
1843860	1845860	so that in fact they got an answer.
1845860	1847860	12 is still open.
1847860	1851860	So it's a subject with essentially no theorems left.
1851860	1856860	And the other hand has consumed tremendous amount of time
1856860	1859860	on the part of mathematicians over the ages,
1859860	1864860	including what was almost certainly the history's greatest group theorist, John Thompson.
1864860	1868860	And in fact he will come in occasionally in the morning, he used to, and come in and said,
1868860	1870860	I was thinking about the problem again.
1870860	1875860	And the problem meant a projective geometry, finite projective geometry.
1875860	1878860	If you don't know what finite projective geometry is,
1878860	1881860	it doesn't matter, it has actually no relevance to what I've just been saying,
1881860	1885860	since it's never found an application.
1885860	1890860	But a certain minority of mathematics does find applications and it looks remarkable.
1890860	1895860	If you look at Wigner's paper, he points to these branches of mathematics
1895860	1898860	that had nothing to do with physics in the beginning,
1898860	1902860	nothing to do with the real world, and yet they became important in physics.
1902860	1904860	But they were non-arbitrary.
1904860	1906860	Number one, number two, they had theorems.
1906860	1910860	Now the importance of theorems I think should be clear, but let's pause for a moment.
1910860	1915860	The group theory has had incredible number of applications.
1915860	1918860	And it's a subject which has just incredible theorems, right?
1918860	1920860	I mean, I think it strikes everybody.
1920860	1923860	Amazing, starting with so little, how much you get.
1923860	1926860	Well, group theory is officially a part of semi-group theory.
1926860	1928860	There is something called semi-group theory.
1928860	1931860	It has very few theorems that aren't about groups,
1931860	1935860	and yet the world has far more semi-groups than groups.
1935860	1941860	They're all over the place, and it's never become anything close to an applied subject.
1941860	1946860	Not peculiarly enough, if you even further generalize it,
1946860	1951860	and it's possible to view categories as a generalization of semi-groups,
1951860	1954860	then amazingly it finds applications.
1954860	1958860	Now having lived through this, having lived in a subject which was criticized
1958860	1962860	for being so far abstract that it couldn't possibly have anything to do with anything,
1962860	1965860	and then watching two different subjects, quite disparate,
1965860	1968860	physics, theoretical physics on one hand and computer science on the other,
1968860	1971860	finding applications of it,
1971860	1974860	but of course it was the theorems that got applied, not just the language.
1974860	1979860	It was the fact that there were theorems in each subject that were looked at
1979860	1986860	after the fact as if they were tailor-made for the application.
1986860	1992860	So I don't consider that a huge mystery, is what I'm saying.
1992860	1996860	But notice now that I've slipped in something here.
1996860	2000860	Notice that Purse's word was conclusions.
2000860	2002860	My word is theorems.
2002860	2003860	What's the difference?
2003860	2005860	There is certainly a difference.
2005860	2013860	There are all sorts of conclusions that none of us would call theorems.
2013860	2015860	And so what's the difference?
2015860	2018860	Well, interesting, interest.
2018860	2024860	So there's an aesthetic issue involved here.
2024860	2027860	Does it all come down to aesthetics?
2027860	2029860	I mean, what makes a theorem interesting?
2030860	2032860	Why do we tend to agree?
2032860	2036860	Which is a remarkable amount of agreement compared with other subjects
2036860	2040860	on what's interesting and what isn't.
2040860	2044860	There could well be a philosophy of the aesthetics of mathematics.
2044860	2047860	I'm not aware of it.
2047860	2051860	People are making aesthetic judgments all the time.
2051860	2057860	It's constantly being made while you're doing mathematics, while you're learning mathematics.
2057860	2058860	It is different.
2058860	2061860	Making the aesthetic judgment strikes me as something different
2061860	2064860	from studying the philosophy of such judgments.
2064860	2068860	That seems to be true everywhere you use the word aesthetics.
2068860	2074860	Let me pause just for a moment here, by the way, about what I intended to say this earlier,
2074860	2077860	since the notion of aesthetics has arisen.
2077860	2084860	That same line that John Isbell used, I don't know about that, but it is an arbitrary,
2084860	2088860	it can be used other places besides mathematics, you know, and I found it useful.
2088860	2095860	So right on this campus a few years ago, I discovered that architects are used to
2095860	2104860	explaining what they feel about aesthetics with the line that aesthetics are innate.
2104860	2109860	I said, I don't know if they're innate, I just quoted Isbell, it just changed the subject.
2109860	2113860	I don't know if aesthetics are innate, but I do know they're non-arbitrary.
2113860	2116860	And that's, of course, what they meant.
2116860	2120860	There's no need for them to be innate, they might be, who knows, it's irrelevant.
2120860	2126860	So let me, the notion of arbitrariness, of course, now I haven't paused over it.
2126860	2130860	I do need some special properties on this.
2130860	2133860	First of all, notice it's not dichotomous.
2133860	2138860	Some things are more arbitrary than others.
2138860	2141860	Chess is more arbitrary than go.
2141860	2145860	I found people who don't see that right away.
2145860	2148860	But think of the opening position in chess.
2148860	2154860	The whole bunch of arbitrary decisions were made in order to invent that opening position.
2154860	2159860	You could ask why are the bishops closer to the center of the board than the knights.
2159860	2166860	I don't think anybody ever, if there's any evidence that anybody ever experimented with the other possible opening positions, I've not found it.
2166860	2170860	And notice an experiment would be almost unbelievably difficult
2170860	2178860	because you'd have to wait a few hundred years to find out whether those opening positions led to interesting games, right?
2178860	2186860	Go seems to be almost entirely, there's one clearly arbitrary aspect of it, and that's the size of the board, 19 by 19.
2186860	2189860	There are some others, by the way, just to be sure here.
2189860	2192860	There are different ways of scoring.
2192860	2197860	They almost always agree on who the winner is, but there are different ways.
2197860	2203860	There are different ways of resolving the possibility of periodicities.
2203860	2210860	You might have a game that goes around in circles, and so you want something to prevent that, and there are some different choices.
2210860	2222860	But interesting, in my looking at the literature on go, people who are serious about go seem to take those as variations of the game of go.
2222860	2230860	There are standard things, standard ways in which international championships are decided, but whatnot, but they are viewed as arbitrary.
2230860	2240860	So here's a case, notice that the notion of arbitrariness is you enhance the non-arbitrariness by generalizing,
2240860	2244860	but please keep in mind there are plenty of cases where it goes just the other way.
2244860	2249860	Clearly the single most non-arbitrary thing we study is the natural numbers.
2249860	2254860	And that's one, you know, it's categorical in the old-fashioned sense of the word.
2254860	2262860	There aren't any variations of what natural numbers means in the sense of number theory without an adjective in front of the word number.
2262860	2272860	So one has to tinker a bit with the notion of arbitrariness to begin to make this work.
2273860	2283860	There is a thought experiment, but every so often I do meet somebody who I find resistant to this notion of what do I mean by arbitrariness.
2283860	2290860	Well there's a clear thought experiment which I know that I use, I'm not sure other people want to use it,
2290860	2300860	but the thought experiment I'm talking about is what do you expect when you talk to another intelligence species in another solar system?
2301860	2307860	You pretty much expect them to have a game of chess, but it won't be our game of chess, right?
2307860	2310860	I mean that sounds highly improbable that they would.
2310860	2318860	In fact, I think if we had chess with the same opening position we would immediately have evidence that we had a common ancestor somehow.
2318860	2325860	One other alternative you have to hold in mind, it is possible that there was an evolutionary process that games were experimented with
2325860	2328860	and it was settled on this one other than by accident.
2328860	2332860	Same thing by the way when it comes of course to physics, that's the better known case,
2332860	2340860	that the things that are arbitrary in physics like the certain constants and things like that, this has received a lot of attention of course.
2340860	2351860	There's the anthropic view that we happen to be in one of many, many universes in which the constants are well designed for us to be in it and therefore to observe it.
2351860	2357860	There's the other possibility which I find much more enticing, but apparently it hasn't led anywhere,
2357860	2363860	that you want to define a structure which could evolve into the right constants.
2363860	2369860	So the one that first attracted me early enough, I mean it seems awfully arbitrary to me initially,
2369860	2373860	that the dimension of the space we live in is three.
2373860	2380860	Now what we mean by dimension has radically changed, so mathematicians want to say dimension in the small or in the large or something.
2380860	2383860	This turns out to be dimension in the middle somewhere, right?
2383860	2389860	So the perceptual dimension I guess is what I want to say, is one possible way of saying it.
2389860	2400860	You can argue easily enough that if the dimension went three then you wouldn't expect something like the inverse square law for a force.
2400860	2408860	But if you're thinking of dimension as only integer valued as not something that can vary continuously in some sense,
2408860	2412860	then that sounds too arbitrary.
2412860	2417860	So therefore have some nature of space in which you can have fractional dimensions,
2417860	2422860	and of course the relevant notion is something called Hausdorff dimension, whatever that is.
2422860	2430860	Yeah, it's essentially the relationship between the radius of a sphere and the amount of how much it contains.
2430860	2436860	And that you would like some picture, some system in which you could argue that if it varied away from dimension three,
2436860	2441860	things would cause it to bounce back, to come back to dimension three,
2441860	2449860	that if you got over dimension three then the forces would dissipate too quickly, that sort of thing.
2449860	2456860	And you would then maybe end up with a picture of space, of all the physics maybe, in which nothing was arbitrary.
2457860	2462860	And in that case I would say we would start thinking of it as a branch of mathematics.
2462860	2464860	That hasn't happened yet.
2464860	2468860	So we have to patch up the notion of arbitrary to make this work,
2468860	2473860	and you can't escape the fact that you're going to end up deciding that things are interesting or not,
2473860	2475860	and that that's an important part of it.
2475860	2479860	The importance of by the way of being interesting,
2479860	2482860	if you want one hell of a lot of theorems,
2482860	2485860	and you don't care, maybe I should say conclusions,
2485860	2488860	and not care about the interest,
2488860	2490860	then it's perfectly simple what you want to do.
2490860	2492860	You want to adopt an inconsistent theory,
2492860	2494860	and then you can prove everything, right?
2499860	2504860	You'd have all the theorems you ever could, conclusions perhaps I should say you'll ever need.
2504860	2507860	So there's an interplay there,
2507860	2511860	and so the whole thing may be a cheat, what I'm preaching.
2511860	2514860	And that's a possibility that I'm afraid does occur to me.
2516860	2518860	I want shortly to open up to questions,
2518860	2523860	because I think that'll be a lot more interesting than me keep expounding on these things.
2523860	2526860	But I do want to mention, maybe I know, let me do that.
2526860	2529860	I have a coda that can come later.
2529860	2531860	So let me stop now,
2531860	2535860	and nobody is objected yet to anything I've said.
2535860	2538860	Let's object or do something.
2538860	2540860	No questions?
2540860	2542860	Yeah, Zeldin.
2542860	2545860	You mentioned mathematics is not arbitrary.
2545860	2546860	Right.
2546860	2550860	That's a slick description of the object that I'm now addressing you.
2550860	2554860	Could you say, well, it's objected in some sense.
2554860	2559860	So not arbitrary, but a little more like objected in some point or another.
2559860	2562860	So the question is, for the record,
2562860	2564860	what's this have to do with objectivity?
2564860	2566860	I haven't the slightest idea.
2566860	2568860	What does that mean in this context?
2568860	2573860	It just means that now we can talk about mathematical truth and other things,
2573860	2578860	similar to what we've talked about in the experiment last time.
2578860	2584860	Truth, as opposed to having necessary conclusions.
2584860	2585860	Exactly.
2588860	2591860	It strikes me as a separate question.
2591860	2596860	I think you're asking what's the validity of logic for something.
2596860	2603860	I mean, is there some kind of a, I don't know, let's say, continuum hypothesis.
2603860	2612860	Somehow, should we have a way which we would say is correct?
2612860	2617860	Okay, I'm going to have to answer the question again for the record is,
2617860	2621860	do I have anything to say about, say, the truth of the continuum hypothesis?
2621860	2622860	Exactly.
2622860	2623860	That would be an application.
2623860	2625860	That would be a nice one.
2625860	2628860	So let me expound just a bit on that.
2628860	2633860	I have, as Zoltan surely knows, a view about the foundations of mathematics that may not,
2633860	2637860	I think, is becoming standard over time.
2637860	2640860	So let me just talk about this just for a moment.
2640860	2645860	By and large, the practice of mathematics was remarkably free of foundations.
2645860	2649860	The semantics of the subject matter for most mathematicians was irrelevant.
2649860	2651860	They had a semantics.
2652860	2657860	They felt they knew what they were talking about when they were talking about the natural numbers, for instance.
2657860	2663860	Albeit, there were some areas that came up particularly in analysis roughly 100 years ago
2663860	2666860	that seemed to be more complicated than that.
2666860	2670860	When we came, and this turned out not to be mathematics,
2670860	2676860	but when there arose a subject in which the semantics was not at all clear,
2676860	2681860	namely computer science, set theory was found to be useless.
2681860	2685860	And so we had to look entirely elsewhere for semantics,
2685860	2689860	in which the continuum hypothesis appears to be totally irrelevant.
2689860	2692860	Okay, so that's that first thing.
2692860	2701860	Now, I was, as indicated in the introduction, in the business of building devices where you can vary.
2701860	2706860	So I usually describe it as what happened to geometry in the 19th century,
2706860	2710860	happened to foundations in the 20th century.
2710860	2712860	You took a much more expansive view.
2712860	2714860	It wasn't a single foundations.
2714860	2716860	There were many foundations.
2716860	2720860	You would pick the one that you wanted to make interesting theorems.
2720860	2724860	So watch what happened.
2724860	2728860	I mean, look what happened in the 19th century for geometry.
2728860	2730860	It started, I think it's fair to say,
2730860	2733860	it turns out you can find some earlier antecedents for this,
2733860	2738860	but by and large it was the case that in the year 1800 there was Euclidean,
2738860	2739860	they didn't need the word Euclidean.
2739860	2740860	There was geometry.
2740860	2742860	It's what we now call Euclidean geometry.
2742860	2744860	You didn't have to worry about alternatives.
2744860	2747860	In the middle of the century, people found that there were,
2747860	2750860	wanted to explore alternative geometries.
2750860	2753860	And by the end of the century, people no longer believe
2753860	2757860	that the original one was describing this real world.
2757860	2761860	Which I think I pointed out actually is a not a well posed question
2761860	2763860	until you say which physics you're going to use
2763860	2766860	to decide whether it's describing it or not.
2766860	2769860	But now let me point out that Kant was essentially right,
2769860	2772860	albeit not when it came to the specific things about
2772860	2776860	the analyticity and synthetic and all that stuff.
2776860	2779860	There was something special about Euclidean geometry.
2779860	2781860	It was, in fact, it is.
2781860	2782860	Let me use the present tense.
2782860	2786860	It is less arbitrary than the other geometries.
2786860	2789860	I don't think you have to say it's innate.
2789860	2795860	I think it is simply the fact that it's reasonably clear to me
2795860	2797860	that this may be peculiar.
2797860	2799860	I may have trouble defending this,
2799860	2803860	but to say that space is positively curved or negatively curved,
2803860	2805860	they both sound like arbitrary decisions where to say
2805860	2808860	it has no curvature, it all sounds unarbitrary.
2808860	2811860	I do know that as a very young kid,
2811860	2815860	a friend and I measured the circumference of a tree
2815860	2818860	and wondered what the diameter was,
2818860	2823860	and said, well, we took a little fruit juice glass
2823860	2825860	and measured it there and saw it was about three to one,
2825860	2827860	and we're happy with that answer.
2827860	2829860	It never occurred to either of us,
2829860	2831860	and we had to be told years later
2831860	2833860	that we could have been living in a space
2833860	2836860	in which that ratio between diameter and circumference
2836860	2840860	was dependent on scale, that it wasn't constant.
2840860	2844860	So that sounded arbitrary, right?
2844860	2846860	Whereas sort of the neutral decision
2846860	2848860	was to say that it's constant.
2848860	2850860	And it seems to me there are a lot of things like that
2850860	2854860	that tell you that classical geometry was the least arbitrary.
2854860	2858860	If you had to settle on one, that would be it.
2858860	2860860	I don't think it has to do with...
2860860	2862860	Well, it's reasonably clear to me
2862860	2866860	that if we lived in a space of non-zero curvature,
2866860	2869860	we would build our blackboards to have zero curvature.
2869860	2871860	We would need it to teach calculus.
2871860	2874860	That's right.
2874860	2880860	That requires a zero curvature plane.
2880860	2884860	So back to the continuum hypothesis.
2884860	2887860	I don't think it's a well-posed question, as stated.
2887860	2891860	I think there is a non-arbitrary notion of a minimal set theory,
2891860	2894860	which allows things like the axioms of ZF,
2894860	2896860	and I'm willing to bet anybody
2896860	2900860	that will eventually be shown to satisfy the continuum hypothesis.
2900860	2902860	At that last, I'm not sure of,
2902860	2907860	but I reasonably would expect it, I think.
2907860	2910860	I'd put odds on it, put it that way.
2910860	2912860	But you are making an arbitrary decision
2912860	2915860	when you say, which set theory are you looking at?
2915860	2920860	And so it is not an absolute question, as posed.
2920860	2923860	It seems to me that the continuum hypothesis,
2923860	2926860	you do need some other stuff you have to state
2926860	2929860	to ask whether or not it's true.
2930860	2936860	So these relationships in and out of the subject.
2936860	2940860	So no, I'm not sure what I have to say about objectivity.
2940860	2943860	I think you still will strive for non-arbitrary.
2943860	2945860	And in fact, it would appear to,
2945860	2947860	when you listen to the people in that business,
2947860	2952860	as we had this conference on set theory last term,
2952860	2954860	and in previous ones, people are looking for,
2954860	2958860	if you look at it, are looking for non-arbitrary principles
2958860	2960860	that would give you an answer.
2960860	2962860	Because the continuum hypothesis, as it is,
2962860	2964860	sounds too arbitrary.
2964860	2967860	You have to say what it is you want your set theory to do
2967860	2969860	before you're going to be able to answer the question.
2969860	2971860	Yeah, yeah.
2971860	2975860	So you can tell me as people that are skeptical
2975860	2976860	about non-arbitrary.
2976860	2978860	So when you first described it,
2978860	2980860	it sounded like you had a theory about,
2980860	2981860	you know, a goal versus chess,
2981860	2982860	and it sounded like this,
2982860	2984860	and I do symmetry and degeneracy and things like this.
2984860	2986860	But now in response to Zoltan, you said,
2986860	2989860	well, you certainly have the feeling of mess in us.
2989860	2991860	But we know, you know, there's all these experiments
2991860	2994860	that show, for example, most people find
2994860	2998860	a risk between physics more natural than any physics.
2998860	3000860	So if you show them, you know, a ball going through a pipe,
3000860	3002860	or a water going through a pipe that's curved,
3002860	3004860	they'll think it's going to keep being curved when it comes out.
3004860	3007860	We know that people find teleological explanations
3007860	3011860	more natural than they make realistic ones.
3011860	3013860	So why trust our judgment about,
3013860	3016860	I mean, we really come down to what we take to be natural.
3016860	3018860	Why trust that this is relevant to the subject
3018860	3020860	that we're talking about?
3020860	3022860	I didn't use the word natural.
3022860	3024860	I don't think...
3029860	3033860	This real world is very arbitrary.
3033860	3034860	So I guess I didn't say that.
3034860	3035860	Perhaps I should have.
3035860	3038860	When you talk about what's true in this particular world,
3038860	3040860	that strikes me already as an arbitrary decision
3040860	3042860	having been made.
3043860	3046860	That at the moment is the difference between physics,
3046860	3051860	the most clear difference between physics and mathematics,
3051860	3052860	is precisely that.
3052860	3054860	Physics is about a particular world
3054860	3058860	in which you can do experiments and things like that.
3058860	3060860	I said it's possible that physics will develop
3060860	3063860	to a point where all the peculiarities of this real world,
3063860	3066860	well, maybe not all, but a huge amount of them
3066860	3070860	can be explained away as arbitrary, non-arbitrary.
3073860	3081860	So yes, somebody better hold of what is meant by arbitrary.
3081860	3086860	So this is work in process.
3086860	3089860	In process, whatever the right word is there.
3093860	3096860	The fact that the ordinary human brain
3096860	3098860	has certain funny ways of doing it strikes me
3098860	3101860	as an arbitrary fact about the nature of human brains
3101860	3103860	more than that, so it doesn't bother me terribly.
3103860	3106860	In fact, one can make a very good argument
3106860	3108860	that most of the history of science
3108860	3110860	is to refute common sense.
3113860	3119860	But in doing so, you're trying to go by the folklore aspect of it.
3119860	3120860	That's arbitrary.
3120860	3122860	Whereas when it reaches by trying to use it
3122860	3124860	based on some sort of experimental evidence,
3124860	3127860	I think you're reaching there for less arbitrariness.
3127860	3129860	But again, that's not mathematics.
3132860	3134860	If you want to allow the possibility
3134860	3137860	that there's another intelligent species somewhere
3137860	3140860	that can include, their number theory will have different,
3140860	3142860	some of their theorems and number theory
3142860	3145860	will contradict our theorems and number theory,
3145860	3147860	then I don't know what I could say to you.
3147860	3150860	I mean, that is a possibility, I suppose.
3150860	3154860	But I wouldn't consider it a realistic one.
3154860	3158860	So that's not, I'm saying why I'm not answering the question.
3159860	3160860	Yeah.
3160860	3161860	I have a slightly different question
3161860	3162860	towards that argument.
3162860	3164860	So you started off saying mathematics is one way of thinking
3164860	3166860	about mathematics as being non-arbitrary.
3166860	3168860	So that's from sort of the data,
3168860	3171860	sort of continuum of cases with like KS and Go.
3171860	3172860	Right.
3172860	3174860	So I guess the question now is,
3174860	3176860	in my mind, is the boundary around mathematics,
3176860	3178860	you know, how arbitrary counts as mathematics,
3178860	3180860	is that arbitrary?
3180860	3181860	Well, as I said.
3181860	3182860	Where do we start?
3182860	3183860	Where do we start with the game?
3183860	3184860	No, no.
3184860	3185860	There's no problems.
3185860	3188860	If you forget about the necessity for theorems,
3188860	3191860	then I pointed out you could go all the way to non-arbitrary
3191860	3192860	and have no theorems.
3192860	3194860	All the way to non-arbitrary.
3194860	3197860	And then if you forget about the interest involved,
3197860	3199860	you can do the same thing.
3199860	3203860	Let me go back to chess and Go and whatnot.
3203860	3208860	If you proved, this isn't precisely an answer to your question,
3208860	3212860	but if somebody proved that, say,
3212860	3216860	there was a strategy to win in chess for the first player,
3216860	3219860	for white.
3219860	3222860	And the fact that you could prove that existence
3222860	3224860	doesn't mean that you could actually get hold of it, right?
3224860	3226860	I mean, there are games that you can prove
3226860	3228860	there's a strategy for one player or the other,
3228860	3231860	and yet you have no idea what the strategy is.
3231860	3234860	I don't think that would be considered a mathematical result.
3234860	3238860	I don't think it would be considered a result in mathematics,
3238860	3241860	in fact, in ordinary usage.
3241860	3245860	Same with Go unless you remove the 19.
3245860	3249860	If you had a theorem about Go which was for an arbitrary shape,
3249860	3253860	well, I said shape there, let's start with a square board,
3253860	3255860	but of arbitrary size.
3255860	3257860	It would begin to sound more like mathematics,
3257860	3259860	still not mathematics.
3259860	3263860	If you then had a theorem about Go played on an arbitrary graph
3263860	3267860	on a plane, and if you have the necessary and sufficient
3267860	3270860	conditions, a nice statement of the necessary and sufficient
3270860	3274860	conditions for that graph to determine who has a strategy.
3274860	3279860	That, I think, would be accepted as a result in mathematics.
3279860	3282860	Would we expect to do that for some kind of extra threshold
3282860	3285860	and then we might properly division in the second place?
3285860	3286860	Yeah.
3286860	3290860	Yeah, I would.
3290860	3292860	It's a hand that it wasn't.
3292860	3295860	So again, I'm not sure if I'm answering your questions,
3295860	3299860	but as I said, this is a work in progress or process,
3299860	3305860	whichever word is relevant there.
3305860	3307860	Is that a hand?
3307860	3309860	Do I have to answer a question?
3309860	3310860	Ask a question?
3310860	3311860	Yeah.
3311860	3312860	Very.
3312860	3314860	Maybe I'm mishearing you, but there seem to be say,
3314860	3319860	sorry, set of mathematics is defined by the questions you ask.
3319860	3321860	I just said it was the theorems you end up with.
3321860	3322860	Oh, OK.
3322860	3325860	So, yes, I certainly am.
3325860	3328860	I think that's unavoidable.
3328860	3331860	I mean, I don't know a human endeavor, which isn't,
3331860	3334860	intellectual endeavor, which isn't so defined.
3334860	3337860	By the way, for the record, is mathematics defined by the questions
3337860	3338860	that are asked?
3338860	3339860	Yeah, of course.
3339860	3368860	Yeah, the questions that pose themselves are the non-arbitrary ones.
3368860	3371860	That's what makes them, that's how you know that they're posed,
3371860	3373860	that they answer, that they pose themselves.
3373860	3376860	It's because of their very non-arbitraryness.
3376860	3381860	The questions we end up asking for practice, the finger exercises,
3381860	3386860	those are arbitrary until we get to the really good questions.
3386860	3402860	In theory.
3402860	3407860	Of course, I wouldn't, in fact, I, well, OK, now,
3407860	3410860	see, there's another huge problem,
3410860	3414860	which I thought I would try to subsume by that notion of interest,
3414860	3417860	maybe.
3417860	3421860	You know, everything in mathematics is a totology.
3421860	3423860	And that's not, of course, at all what we mean.
3423860	3425860	That's a different subject.
3425860	3428860	There is a huge difference between arbitrary totologies
3428860	3430860	and the things that we call, maybe in theory,
3430860	3433860	all the theorems are totologies.
3433860	3437860	But not all totologies are theorems, right?
3437860	3441860	So, yes, I mean, so let's take the example people usually point to,
3441860	3446860	and that's the game invented, among others, by John Nash.
3446860	3450860	In fact, by the way, just for the, just since we're on the subject,
3450860	3456860	there is a scene in the movie where they don't say they're playing go.
3456860	3458860	You're supposed to assume they're playing go.
3458860	3461860	And Nash, the young Nash as a student at Princeton is upset
3461860	3464860	because the first player should win.
3464860	3471860	Now, it's, what's clear at the go board is it has far too many stones on it.
3471860	3477860	So it can't be go, because serious go players would never still be playing
3477860	3480860	without many stones left on the board.
3480860	3483860	So I thought, oh, this is, that Nash must have,
3483860	3488860	when Nash invented his game, which I won't try to describe here,
3488860	3492860	he did play it on a go board, and he supplied the proof
3492860	3497860	using some algebraic topology that there had to be a strategy for the first player.
3497860	3503860	I actually got hold of the scriptwriters on that one, and I was wrong.
3503860	3508860	They said they put that many stones on the go board because they looked nicer,
3508860	3512860	and they said, but in fact they did film some other scenes
3512860	3516860	in which Nash goes and invents the game of go, of Nash.
3516860	3522860	And so they, I was wrong in my inference on it.
3522860	3525860	Let me describe a game that's simpler to describe.
3525860	3528860	In fact, you've all played it.
3528860	3534860	It's Japanese name is Gomoku, and it's a wonderful pun there.
3534860	3537860	The word go is the Japanese word for five.
3537860	3539860	It is also the word for small stones.
3539860	3543860	And it's, in the first case, it describes the standard game of go.
3543860	3547860	This is a different game played with the same stones on the same board, right?
3547860	3549860	And it's five in a row.
3549860	3553860	You've all played it by every culture, I think, that's around to inventing that game.
3553860	3555860	You play on a rectilinear grid.
3555860	3557860	You don't have to specify the size.
3557860	3559860	Take it to be unbounded size.
3559860	3563860	And first player who gets five in a row of his color wins.
3563860	3565860	This is one in which it's easy to prove.
3565860	3570860	Sorry, chances are probably there's a strategy for both sides to draw.
3570860	3572860	So let me be careful how I state this.
3572860	3576860	It's easy to prove that there is no strategy for the second player to win.
3576860	3581860	Because you have a little construction, you take any possible strategy for the second player to win,
3581860	3584860	and you can quickly convert it into one for the first player to win.
3584860	3587860	So therefore, there couldn't have been one for the second player to win.
3587860	3591860	If you could supply the fact that the game must terminate,
3591860	3593860	then you would have a strategy for the first player.
3593860	3595860	The game of Nash has that nice feature.
3595860	3597860	Again, because of a little algebraic topology,
3597860	3600860	you know that there has to be a winner if they play long enough.
3600860	3605860	And that's where the algebraic topology comes in.
3605860	3608860	Notice there's nothing like an enumeration here.
3608860	3611860	And therefore, these are mildly interesting theorems.
3611860	3614860	If they were obtained by enumeration, they wouldn't be interesting theorems.
3614860	3619860	So part of the word interest there has to do with the proof, the nature of the proof.
3620860	3628860	And since, I mean, there should be someday a philosophy of the aesthetics of mathematics,
3628860	3633860	the most people would ask, what's the word of aesthetics that mathematicians are most apt to use,
3633860	3635860	say, well, the word is clearly elegant.
3635860	3637860	Well, not true if you think about it.
3637860	3639860	The word is interesting.
3639860	3643860	You're using it so often, you don't even notice it as an aesthetic judgment.
3643860	3648860	And there are all sorts of theorems that are very interesting, which are totally inelegant,
3648860	3654860	because the interest will tend to come from the fact that they have a lot of nice corollaries,
3654860	3656860	and they tell you about a lot.
3656860	3660860	And then there are a few things, like the theorem I just described, without going into the details,
3660860	3666860	in which the interest is very limited, but it has a nice, elegant little proof comes out.
3666860	3670860	I mean, Nash as a student came up with.
3670860	3676860	By and large, if a speaker in mathematics starts with the fact that the theorem I'm going to prove
3676860	3683860	isn't all that interesting, but the proof is interesting, you know that you might find an excuse to get out of the room.
3683860	3688860	This is usually a cop-out for not having an interesting theorem.
3688860	3690860	But this is a good part of it.
3690860	3698860	So the complication coming in from this notion of interest is going to be a devious complication.
3698860	3701860	It can rest on the nature of the proof.
3701860	3706860	There are things that mathematicians, theorems that mathematicians in particular like to tell each other,
3706860	3710860	and the theorems are uninteresting, but they have wonderful little proofs.
3710860	3715860	And so this is a part of it.
3715860	3720860	And as I say, it's one that I can only say, well, maybe this isn't even philosophical anymore.
3720860	3726860	Maybe aesthetic judgments themselves, the actual judgments, aren't part of philosophy.
3726860	3728860	Yeah?
3729860	3733860	Not easy.
3733860	3735860	Take some work.
3735860	3737860	That's okay, right?
3737860	3740860	I mean, but you quite right.
3740860	3745860	It may not be anywhere near as arbitrary as we think, but you certainly in hell can strive for it.
3745860	3747860	That's clear.
3747860	3756860	So yes, if you want to, I would be willing to modify or put this in as a caveat that quite possibly is all terribly arbitrary.
3756860	3761860	But what you're trying to be as unarbitrary as possible.
3761860	3767860	I don't, well, if I'm prepared to say that that is the same as non-arbitrary,
3767860	3770860	now that's not what Platonism meant.
3770860	3773860	So I don't think I need Platonism there.
3773860	3780860	For the, I mean, the fact that mathematicians often become Platonists,
3781860	3788860	it's the same phenomenon that a playwright, let's say, more, let me say scriptwriter rather than playwright,
3788860	3794860	often finds that the dialogue is writing itself, particularly if you're doing soap operas and things like that, right?
3794860	3797860	I mean, he's sitting there in the dialogues writing itself.
3797860	3802860	They never fall into the trap of thinking therefore the characters exist.
3802860	3805860	Mathematicians do.
3806860	3812860	I mean, leave me, I do have a coda as it were.
3812860	3819860	So let me just be, before we, let's stop the questioning a little bit before, ah, it's 20 of 6 already.
3819860	3822860	Yeah, there was a hand up there.
3836860	3841860	Well, for, okay, first of all, no, you can't.
3841860	3844860	I mean, nobody's got a good theorem proving program.
3844860	3846860	There are profound problems there.
3846860	3851860	They're usually most understood to be or summarized by the phrase problem of equality.
3851860	3856860	Mathematicians are constantly saying this is the same as that when they don't, when you don't, you know,
3856860	3859860	it's very nebulous what they're saying at that point.
3859860	3862860	There are two uses of the word proof.
3862860	3872860	When, when I say I can prove or let's be more accurate, Tarski proved that there is a proof that, um,
3872860	3875860	we have to be careful, Tarski didn't prove it.
3875860	3885860	A corollary of what Tarski proved proves that there aren't any 16 dimensional division algebras
3885860	3888860	associative or not over the algebraic reels.
3888860	3892860	Why? Because Tarski proved that that's a decidable theory,
3892860	3896860	and the decisions only depend upon the definition of real closed field,
3896860	3900860	and it was proven for the real field using a lot of topology.
3900860	3903860	That's right. So, which wouldn't apply at all to the algebraic reels.
3903860	3907860	Okay, so the inner proof is a technical notion.
3907860	3910860	You find out, you notice that this is a first order statement and all that.
3910860	3916860	The outer thing, Tarski proved, that's the, that's the, the, the real notion, the, the public notion,
3916860	3919860	or you're usually using, and we're nowhere near that.
3919860	3927860	Um, I have this peculiar assertion that that proof, those proofs, the ones that live in real life,
3927860	3932860	exist in fact only in their performance and what's written as a score thereof.
3932860	3935860	And that's why, well, that's, that's a whole nother lecture.
3935860	3938860	But, but, that's a very informal notion.
3938860	3943860	So, in fact, the proofs we actually use to convince each other that, that proofs may exist.
3943860	3946860	Uh, yes, I would like to see a program doing something.
3946860	3949860	I would like to see a machine develop a personnel.
3949860	3951860	I would like to see persons reciting in machines.
3951860	3956860	I don't, I think they're of the same, they'll happen about the same time.
3956860	3961860	I would guess that we'll have machines that can make us the same, similar aesthetic judgments
3961860	3965860	about theorems as humans that, when we have theorems that we recognize as persons,
3965860	3968860	when we have machines that we recognize as persons.
3969860	3973860	Um, one, one more hand.
3973860	3975860	Then I've got my coda, yeah.
3975860	3984860	You've anticipated my coda.
3984860	3989860	I will not repeat the question for the record because it will sound like it's a total.
3989860	3992860	Okay, so the coda is the following.
3992860	3996860	There was a name, there was a name missing from that list.
3997860	4000860	Um, that I started with.
4000860	4005860	There was a philosopher, professor of philosophy at Brown University named John Ladd.
4005860	4010860	Over the years, I've met a remarkable number of people who were strongly influenced by John Ladd
4010860	4013860	in all sorts of subjects, by the way.
4013860	4015860	I never took a course from him.
4015860	4017860	Uh, never really sat at his feet.
4017860	4021860	But he, I was one of many that he had a something of a good influence on.
4021860	4025860	I think the second week I was at Brown,
4025860	4029860	he sat down next to me, he was chief resident fellow,
4029860	4037860	and he considered it part of his job to eat lunch with the students in the big dining room we all ate lunch in
4037860	4039860	in those days.
4039860	4043860	Uh, and so he sat down next to me.
4043860	4051860	Now, I, I begin by talking about, we have, we have to find ways to explain to other people what it is that
4051860	4052860	mathematicians do.
4052860	4055860	Philosophers have to do the same thing, of course.
4055860	4061860	Uh, there's a huge difference between the public view of, well, if you, I did an inadvertent experiment years ago,
4061860	4066860	which I've repeated a number of times, say to the first time it was with some high school students,
4066860	4074860	and I was casually mentioned a philosopher I knew, I said a professional, professional philosopher,
4074860	4077860	and that phrase got a rise, professional philosopher.
4077860	4079860	How could there be such things, right?
4079860	4084860	I mean, they were aware of some great philosophers, but you know a, you know, that same sort of thing.
4084860	4096860	And I think, uh, so let's see, by the time I was a freshman, I think I had some awareness that professors of philosophy wrote papers,
4096860	4103860	and as far as I could tell, though, all they did was refute other philosophers.
4104860	4105860	And so I said that.
4105860	4114860	What I said to him was, what's it like being a member of a profession in which your reputation rests on your ability to refute others?
4114860	4121860	And he proceeded to tell me about synthesis and tithesis, I should say, thesis and tithesis and synthesis,
4121860	4129860	taking as his main example Thomas, synthesizing essentially the Greek thought and the Christian thought.
4130860	4135860	Um, well, that's just the beginning of the story.
4135860	4140860	Some weeks later, but again, it was my first semester at Brown.
4140860	4146860	Also at lunch, but a more formal occasion, I find myself sitting next to someone.
4146860	4149860	No, I don't know who it was.
4149860	4151860	I didn't know who it was even the next day.
4151860	4154860	I don't think I ever saw him again.
4154860	4157860	I'm assuming he was a philosopher.
4157860	4165860	To make conversation with me, he said, what do you think about logicism and formalism and intuitionism?
4165860	4172860	And I said, oh, I think they should be synthesized.
4172860	4176860	And he immediately got a different expression on his face.
4176860	4182860	He actually started, you know, maybe I should listen to this person's sort of expression.
4182860	4185860	And he said, that's very interesting.
4185860	4189860	And there was a quietness.
4189860	4194860	I mean, I was supposed to say something and so, I didn't know really what the words meant.
4194860	4200860	I think I had heard the words and I had some very vague idea of what they referred to.
4200860	4209860	But I did know that in the 19th century, they had learned to model these different kinds of geometry in each other.
4209860	4218860	So I said, well, I said, surely we will learn to reduce each of them to any of the other two, right?
4218860	4225860	I mean, so any question of one can be translated into a question in the other.
4225860	4238860	Yeah, I mean, it turns out that to make that process easy turned out to be a good hunk of the research of Alex of Andre Shedroff and I.
4239860	4244860	Just to do that sort of thing.
4244860	4246860	But I didn't know that then.
4246860	4250860	But then I did say, I only recently remembered all this again.
4250860	4255860	I mean, I didn't remember it over and over the years.
4255860	4262860	I said, of course, when you translate a question from one place to the other, it can look quite different.
4262860	4267860	And in fact, if you didn't know what the original question is, it wouldn't look interesting.
4268860	4277860	And so I said, but of course, that shows you that the real issue is what do you find interesting?
4277860	4280860	I'd forgotten temporarily this for you.
4280860	4288860	So in other words, I've just come back to where I was at the age of, I mean, the first freshman year, which also, of course, might mean that I didn't come back to it.
4288860	4291860	It was always there and this is biased my whole approach, right?
4291860	4302860	But I'm prepared, at least for the near future, to continue to defend the principle that finally what we really have to do is say, what do we find interesting and why?
4302860	4306860	And that should be the rest of the subject of mathematics.
4306860	4308860	I guess that's the end.
4308860	4310860	Thank you.
4310860	4312860	Good.
4312860	4314860	Center time.
