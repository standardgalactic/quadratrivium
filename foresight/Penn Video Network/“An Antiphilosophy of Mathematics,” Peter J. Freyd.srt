1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,480
So, on behalf of the School of Arts and Sciences and Penn Engineering, I am very pleased to

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,460
welcome you to the seventh annual Thomas and Yvonne Williams Lecture for the Advancement

3
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:17,880
of Logic and Philosophy.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,120
We are most grateful for the generosity and vision that Tom and Yvonne have shown in establishing

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:29,660
the fund that supports this series of lectures and that makes possible other educational

6
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,620
activities at the university and at upper schools in our region.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:41,020
It was a great pleasure to work with Tom when I first arrived at Penn and to watch him develop

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:47,140
through the study of Logic and Philosophy that clarity of mind which he has so successfully

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:53,620
brought to bear in the sphere of practical affairs and that sustains his ongoing passion

10
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,100
for the life of the mind.

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,060
And it remains a great pleasure to work with him now on a range of activities that will

12
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:08,140
advance a general appreciation of the power of reason to clarify problems both practical

13
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,380
and theoretical.

14
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,060
I am delighted to introduce this year's Williams Lecturer, Peter Fried.

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,020
Peter is an internationally renowned expert on category theory and its applications in

16
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,940
computer science.

17
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:29,380
He pioneered the development of Topos theory and its use in articulating precise semantics

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,980
for programming languages.

19
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:39,980
In 2010, he was awarded the Lix Test of Time Award for his 1990 paper, Recursive Types

20
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,140
Reduced to Inductive Types.

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,980
Peter is professor of mathematics and of computer and information science here at Penn.

22
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:56,140
He has played a leading role in the university's logic and computation group since its inception.

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:04,180
His deep insights and fierce intellectual honesty have inspired the group for many years.

24
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:10,580
Please join me in warmly welcoming Peter Fried who will speak to us about an anti-philosophy

25
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:20,700
of mathematics.

26
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,900
I received an email which is what I want to show you.

27
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,900
The author refused to let me use his name.

28
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,780
I will be talking about an anti-philosophy of mathematics but that's just one tiny thing

29
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,740
compared with other things which are more in the realm of philosophy of mathematics.

30
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,540
You will also hear that I have some things to say about anti-philosophies maybe of some

31
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,500
other subjects.

32
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:51,060
But I have to say this list of people, the first four names are from Brown University.

33
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,780
By the way, there are names that are there that shouldn't be and some that shouldn't

34
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,260
be but aren't and there are names that aren't there that shouldn't be.

35
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,260
That's the very first one.

36
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,980
Kurt Dukas, is that name still a name to contend with in the world of philosophy?

37
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,380
He was well known in his day and I'm afraid that when I knew him, he was the grand old

38
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:19,860
man of the Brown Philosophy Department, meaning he was about a year younger than I am now.

39
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:30,220
His subject I'm afraid was a paranormal phenomena and I never sat at his feet.

40
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:38,380
It wasn't until years later, like maybe ten years ago, that I find out that this is the

41
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,220
founder of the Journal of Symbolic Logic, the first president of the Association of Symbolic

42
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,580
Logic.

43
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,100
There was no trace of that when I knew him.

44
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:55,980
The next three are people from whom I took graduate courses in philosophy at Brown.

45
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:03,700
Leslie Salmon has gone, I mean he was then something of a logician.

46
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,500
He's progressed beyond that since.

47
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,820
Stefan Koerner from England was there for just a year.

48
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:12,580
It was essentially the beginning of his interest in the philosophy of mathematics.

49
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:19,740
There were three, as I say, three, when I said graduate courses, they were in fact all seminars.

50
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,860
Archism was the important one.

51
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,860
He did have a strong influence on me over the years.

52
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,500
I do have a copy of this.

53
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,060
Oh, I've got one right here.

54
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,980
Carl Hemple doesn't belong there.

55
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:38,540
This now starts with a few names from Princeton.

56
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,500
I had very little contact with him.

57
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,180
Alonzo Church, the mystery to me about Alonzo Church is why he insisted I wasn't able to

58
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,740
effest for his retirement.

59
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:57,420
I finally received word years later, I mean I did listen to him occasionally, but I certainly

60
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,340
never sat at his feet.

61
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,300
Years later I found out from an organizer that he not only once made me, I made him

62
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,500
laugh out loud, I did it twice and he thought that this was a remarkable achievement and

63
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:20,100
therefore I should.

64
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,620
Kurt Gertl, I never really had, but maybe the time will come.

65
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,580
In fact, a number of the names now, mysteriously enough, even though I first met them or talked

66
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,300
to them somewhere else, re-emerge as important figures.

67
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,620
I have two microphones here at the moment.

68
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,620
Here with connection with Penn, now there's a long story.

69
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,140
When I received this email and looked at it, I realized that a whole bunch of stories

70
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:55,140
to tell you about Penn in philosophy in the 1960s and nobody's left except me and to some

71
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,460
good extent Eriven, who was attending about as many philosophy colloquy as I was, meaning

72
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,500
all of them actually.

73
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Eriven has been at Penn since 1954 and was on the member of the faculty since 1961.

74
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,580
I came in 62.

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,940
If this were a year earlier, I could say that Jim Ross is part of that crowd.

76
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,740
He also came in 62 and we attended the same graduate seminars.

77
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,620
I should make that inclusion the right way.

78
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:29,940
He attended the same graduate seminars that I did at Brown.

79
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,420
Ernest Nagel, I talked to a bit at Columbia, but again, he comes up in connection with Penn.

80
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,780
Now we come to the Penn part.

81
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:39,820
We're represented actually by just a few names.

82
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,260
Let me go back to 1962.

83
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,300
It was a seller's market in those days, meaning that when you went to a math meeting, people

84
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,180
started offering you jobs before they even knew your name.

85
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,620
That's literally the correct.

86
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:05,500
I agreed to come down to Penn as a favor to a young person in the faculty whom I knew.

87
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,980
They did a sales job on me.

88
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,580
Penn was in a state of receivership.

89
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,820
That's not my word.

90
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
That is my word.

91
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,820
Sorry, it's not there.

92
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:18,620
There was a receivership committee chaired, if I'm pretty sure, by Britt Chance.

93
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,460
Is that right, Murray?

94
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,820
Was Britt Chance the chair of the receivership committee for mathematics?

95
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,060
You think about it.

96
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:35,380
There was only one mathematician on the committee and they wanted to rebuild mathematics at Penn.

97
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,780
They seemed to have what they considered a lot of money, and they insisted that I could

98
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,860
build a department at Penn that I was 26 years old at that point.

99
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,820
Actually they talked me into coming up.

100
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,380
Penn's status in the Ivy League in those days was quite iffy.

101
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:57,860
The phrase you would see in a number of publications was that Penn was de classe.

102
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,980
How much of this is known anymore?

103
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,780
Penn started, of course, as a football league, hence the word league.

104
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:08,060
The Ivy League started as a football league.

105
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,180
Penn had moved away from it.

106
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,140
It was often considered the 11th Big Ten.

107
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:18,820
The 11th Big Ten finally did come into formal existence and it turned out to be Penn State,

108
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,700
but that's a different matter.

109
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,820
Somewhere along the line, just a few years earlier, fortunately for all of us here, the

110
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:34,180
university decided to renew its Ivy League football league status, which meant that they

111
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,780
had to go along with all those rules.

112
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,420
This has clearly had a tremendously good effect.

113
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,100
It also gave Penn something of an advantage in hiring people.

114
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,340
I did come.

115
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,420
Now let's go back a bit.

116
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,180
What was Penn known for in those days?

117
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:55,380
I knew that it had a good medical division.

118
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,700
Beyond that, it had four departments, just four.

119
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:05,940
Anthropology, archaeology, they had been the best departments essentially in their subject

120
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,660
from essentially the beginning.

121
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,140
Linguistics and Nelson Goodman.

122
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,020
That was it, meaning the philosophy department.

123
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,300
I arrive here and guess what?

124
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,620
Nelson Goodman isn't here.

125
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,620
He was on leave.

126
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,420
He was in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

127
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,020
It was clear that he had some very attractive offers, at least one.

128
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,500
I'm not sure how many he actually had.

129
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,900
A chairman had been hired away from the University of Buffalo.

130
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,860
Marvin Farber.

131
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:38,060
He should not be in this list.

132
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,620
I certainly never sat at his feet.

133
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,180
You'll hear quite the opposite in a moment.

134
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:45,980
Well, he didn't sit at my feet, that's for sure.

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,900
As it was with Ducasse, I was flabbergasted to learn later some aspects about Marvin Farber,

136
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,380
such as the fact that he was, quote, and I'm quoting directly from the literature, a protégé

137
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,260
of Zermelo.

138
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,780
I learned that within the last week.

139
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,020
That's absolutely flabbergasting to me.

140
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:13,060
At those days, the University was run from the faculty club bar starting about five o'clock.

141
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,380
The provost would arrive, fantastically good provost, David Goddard.

142
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,820
You could do a lot of business if you were willing to go to the faculty club bar at that

143
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,820
hour.

144
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,180
I found myself there one evening, sitting at a table with the provost on one side, the

145
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:32,100
dean of the, what they then called the dean of the college, and the other side, Otto Springer.

146
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,300
His subject was German.

147
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,100
The dean told the provost that much to his surprise, the department didn't want to keep

148
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,060
Nelson Goodman.

149
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,700
I didn't say a word.

150
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,980
I thought I'd better check.

151
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,140
I'd been going to Colloquy.

152
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,540
I knew a good part of the department at that point.

153
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,260
The next morning at about 8.30 in the morning in the provost's office, outer office, there

154
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,340
was a crowd of us.

155
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,780
I was the one nonmember of the department.

156
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Marvin Farber had lied.

157
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,980
It was a straight out and out lie.

158
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,940
He thought, why he thought he could get by with it is beyond my comprehension.

159
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:12,380
We went into the provost's office for some reason, I guess precisely because I was the

160
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,700
one nonmember of the department.

161
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:20,940
People turned to me and I said, good boy, I said, we're here to recommend a university

162
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,260
professorship for Nelson Goodman.

163
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
That worked.

164
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,100
He came back the next year, but only for one year he eventually did go back to Cambridge.

165
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,220
But I was a, as I said, I was attending all the colloquy.

166
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,740
I gave a number of colloquy in those years.

167
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:46,540
And a receivership committee, again, not their word, my word, was set up under the

168
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:53,580
chairmanship of the dean of the graduate school, Roy Nichols, historian.

169
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:57,260
The very first meeting I was there, there was one philosopher, Joseph Clark, if that

170
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:02,620
means Francis Clark, sorry, if that means anything to anybody, who never said a word

171
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,140
in the entire history of that committee.

172
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:10,980
On the opening day of the committee, the chairman said, of course we're going to go

173
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:11,980
very slowly here.

174
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,500
We're not going to make any rapid decisions.

175
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,420
An hour later, the committee unanimously voted that we should make every effort to get Hao

176
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,700
Wang to come to Penn.

177
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,500
I was aware that Wang was movable for some family or personal reason from Harvard.

178
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,940
And he damn near came, by the way.

179
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:37,580
Rockefeller University got him from us at the end.

180
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:45,900
But then I was hiring, at the age of 26, I was hiring people for temporary, well, yes,

181
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,900
I was.

182
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,900
I was hiring young people, actually.

183
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,780
And the next name, Stanley Tenenbaum, is a part of that list.

184
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,940
He was sane at that point.

185
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:02,780
The next few years, we did see Paul Bernays, and now an interesting sequence of people

186
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:07,220
who aren't on this list somehow were around here at Penn.

187
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,300
One was John Mayhill.

188
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,820
He was being kept alive, and that's literally the case, not by the philosophy department,

189
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:17,500
but the computer scientists.

190
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,940
That was, the computer science department didn't officially exist until 1972, but there

191
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:30,740
was a graduate group in computer science.

192
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,140
Mario Boonga was here.

193
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:39,020
Now, I didn't have anything to do with that, but he was here.

194
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:47,220
And at least from that, if I didn't sit at his feet, I at least got my first PhD student,

195
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,220
namely his wife.

196
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,260
Well, anyway, no, it's not a hoax, but it's not the way it appears.

197
00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:01,100
I do want to talk about a philosophy, a possible philosophy for mathematics, and so now I get

198
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,540
a bit more serious.

199
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,220
So by the way, just before I leave it, as I said, as far as I can tell, only one person

200
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,500
left who was actually part of that receivership committee and all that sort of thing.

201
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,900
Well, that I know for sure.

202
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:24,260
It's a strange, weird little piece of history that you had a philosophy department a few

203
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:30,540
years earlier, had an international renown in which a 26-year-old, two years out of his

204
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:35,860
own PhD was hiring people from the philosophy department.

205
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,700
Well, Jim Ross became chairman, and the rest is history.

206
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:46,460
By the way, the first person presently here to come after that was Charles Kahn.

207
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,900
That was 1964.

208
00:14:52,780 --> 00:15:00,340
So, yes, so as any mathematician knows, if you're going to talk about something you need

209
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:06,420
a definition, as just about every philosopher knows, if you're lucky, you'll end up with

210
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,620
definitions, not start out with them, and that, of course, is the case with mathematics,

211
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:15,380
and there's the central question, how in hell do you define mathematics?

212
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,020
And I want to start there.

213
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:26,740
It was, there's an informal reason for wanting something like a definition, as you all know,

214
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,940
that you try to communicate to people who aren't mathematicians what it is that mathematicians

215
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,940
do.

216
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,820
And I was, and so I wouldn't consider this to be anything serious, but it was just effort

217
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,180
of communication.

218
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,460
If I'm in the right mood, I found over the years, if you want an interesting time, casually

219
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:51,740
say that, oh, you invent mathematics and watch the reaction, but if you're not in the mood

220
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:57,060
for that, that you have to be in a special mood for.

221
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:03,380
You want to communicate that mathematics is a subject matter, that it's not just a body

222
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:09,420
of techniques, so one wants to distinguish between mathematics on one hand and the mathematical

223
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:16,020
on the other hand, albeit mathematics presumably is one of the mathematical subjects.

224
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:22,100
And in that process, I find, I found myself saying like things, it is a subject matter.

225
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:27,140
I would use the phrase, it is about something.

226
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:36,380
1969, the summertime, in the city of Brunswick, Maine, I was saying that to a group of people.

227
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:41,820
And another mathematician, now dead, named John Isbill, interrupted me and said, I don't

228
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,540
know if it's about something, but I do know that it's not arbitrary.

229
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,140
And he instantly stopped me.

230
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,380
Now John didn't want to go so far as to say that you could define that mathematics.

231
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,620
You could use that to define mathematics.

232
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,300
I'm not sure if you can, as you'll hear that we have to keep poking the definition to get

233
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,820
something that actually works.

234
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,380
But the way I first wanted to phrase it was, if there were a word in English that stood

235
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,500
as the opposite of arbitrary, I could use that word to say what mathematics was, what

236
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,740
the subject matter of mathematics was.

237
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,860
And in fact, English may have that word, the word may be mathematics.

238
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,260
And there's a lot that stems from this.

239
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,620
I mean, you can proceed, in fact, in the next half hour or so, I will try to give some examples

240
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:39,380
of answering some typical questions, such as, for instance, the unreasonable effectiveness

241
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:47,300
of mathematics to use Wigner's wonderful title of his paper.

242
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,020
But now let me jump right now.

243
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,980
This isn't all I have to say about it, but where this notion of anti-philosophy comes

244
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,980
from.

245
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,220
There's the possibility, if that's the case, that mathematics is that which is least arbitrary,

246
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:08,740
when you ask the question, what is the meaning of a sentence in mathematics, you're asking

247
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,540
for something, if you think about it, necessarily more arbitrary than mathematics.

248
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:17,940
And therefore, it may not be a well-posed question.

249
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,980
Now, there are many anti-philosophies in this sense of the word, meaning, in fact, I've

250
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,740
been predicting for years that somebody is going to come along and prove a girdle-like

251
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:35,380
theorem to the effect that any language sufficiently rich, that to be defined, necessarily allows

252
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:43,140
you to ask questions which don't have any conceivable answer, but sound as if they should.

253
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,820
We're used to that in a number of special cases.

254
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,620
We're used, for instance, in mathematics, except this is a very applied mathematics,

255
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:58,340
to know that to ask what frequencies are present in a signal at a given instance, it just doesn't

256
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,340
make sense.

257
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,740
You can't, I mean, the definition of frequency or how you would measure it is such that you

258
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:08,620
can't ask that question without specifying a non-zero interval.

259
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:14,260
And this indeterminacy between time and frequency, of course, can be used to explain just about

260
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,380
all the physical indeterminacies.

261
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,900
Or some other ones, for instance, the curvature of space.

262
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:26,500
To ask what's the curvature of space, you can't expect to get an answer unless you

263
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,020
start talking about how you're going to use physics to measure it.

264
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,620
So you need to know the physics you're assuming in order to answer the question, what's the

265
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:38,460
curvature of space, meaning real space, the space we live in.

266
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:44,820
And there are a whole bunch of things like that that we're already used to.

267
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,100
There's one which I like to throw at mathematicians as an example.

268
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,000
But I warn you, people can get very upset at this one.

269
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,900
If somebody takes set theory as a serious foundational language for mathematics, I can

270
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:04,300
pose to him, because of its untyped nature, the question, are there any simple groups

271
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,180
that appear as zeros of the zeta function?

272
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,660
I've seen people get very angry at this.

273
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,980
I've seen people forget why I mentioned it.

274
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,380
I didn't really ask it.

275
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,260
I only mentioned it.

276
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:22,340
I've had people come back to me two weeks later swearing at me for bringing up such

277
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,980
an absurd question.

278
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,860
Okay, that's transparently absurd.

279
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,900
Notice, by the way, you have no way of answering it at all, even if you took it for

280
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,580
the moment seriously, until you specify what definition of group you have in mind and

281
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,660
what definition of complex number.

282
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,540
And then after somebody specifies them, I've challenged people, now proved to me that

283
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,420
there aren't any simple groups that he's got.

284
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,940
Look, as I say, there are a lot of these.

285
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:52,660
And one of them may be, one of these questions I'm suggesting may be,

286
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,140
what is the meaning of a mathematical sentence?

287
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,100
Well, let me come back to that.

288
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,780
But that's the only thing that anti-philosophy means there.

289
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:09,460
The idea that the non-arbitraryness of mathematics might be its defining characteristic.

290
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,500
Maybe, I'm not sure about defining characteristic, but it's certainly an important aspect that

291
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,460
of it, of course, has been anticipated any number of times.

292
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,460
Indeed, the most famous definition of mathematics that exists is right here.

293
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,500
See if I can scale it down.

294
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,860
I can't scale it down.

295
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,460
Can I move it?

296
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,820
There we go, let's see.

297
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:36,860
I seem not to be able to scale that down, or now it's too small.

298
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,020
Leave it like that.

299
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:38,900
Leave it like this, okay.

300
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,860
You notice that, except it's not there.

301
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,900
There must have been an easier way of doing this.

302
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,060
Anyway, it's mathematics is the science which draws necessary conclusions.

303
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,060
Why is it in handwriting?

304
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,380
Okay, another little story about Penn from the 60s.

305
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,060
In fact, this is 1962.

306
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,460
The graduate students in the math department came to me with this funny looking book.

307
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,900
It was about this size, very thin.

308
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:09,060
And each page looked like this, except for the title page.

309
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:13,060
The damn thing was hand lithographed.

310
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,460
It turns out from a single lithograph stone that they kept cleaning for

311
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:20,860
the next 100 copies, there are only 100 editions.

312
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,700
This is the first publication, official publication of the National Academy of

313
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,260
Sciences that hadn't been founded that much earlier.

314
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,460
It was finally, I think, appeared around 1872.

315
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,860
The lecture was 1870.

316
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,860
And it is the book and title.

317
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,260
The title is there visible here.

318
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,060
A Linear Associate of Algebra.

319
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,460
Let me just talk about it for a moment.

320
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,260
It doesn't really have anything to do with the philosophy.

321
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,460
But it's fascinating that this book was just stacked in the,

322
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,060
appeared in the stacks at the Penn Library one floor down.

323
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,860
I actually kept it in my house for a year, enjoyed showing it to people.

324
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,860
And wondering if they'd ever noticed that it was missing.

325
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,860
They never did.

326
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,860
I took it to the rare books side of the library where it still resides,

327
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
I'm pretty sure.

328
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,860
As far as I could tell in the last week,

329
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,860
I can find no evidence that any copy of it has ever been sold, amazingly.

330
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Apparently, at least there isn't any record of any, so nobody knows the value of it.

331
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Benjamin Purse's son, I haven't given the name yet, have I?

332
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
I can't.

333
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,860
Unfortunately, I have no control over here.

334
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,860
There are other pages I could look at, but I can't at the moment.

335
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Benjamin Purse.

336
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,860
So since his name isn't here, let me at least write it.

337
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,860
And indeed, this is about the end of it.

338
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
This was the only thing I wanted this for.

339
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,860
So why don't we kill this and get rid of the screens?

340
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,860
No, it didn't work.

341
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,860
Turn off left projector.

342
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
Turn off right projector.

343
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,860
And let's take these down.

344
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,860
Let's take them up.

345
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,860
I used to think I only had left, right confusion.

346
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,860
I am not misspelling it.

347
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:33,860
I once had two signed recommendations on my desk, both from Harvard Purse instructors,

348
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,860
both of whom thought that they were Pierce instructors.

349
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,860
Next time I saw Barry Mazer, in fact, he was that.

350
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
I said, here, I've got to show you these.

351
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
He said, I don't want to see.

352
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:42,860
I've given up.

353
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,860
You can't do it.

354
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,860
The name is spelled that way, and it is Purse.

355
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,860
The book, which I was just showing is, by the way, for the mathematicians in the crowd,

356
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,860
is the first known instance of such words as it impotent, neopotent.

357
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,860
The person's decomposition is there.

358
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,860
Of course, he doesn't give it a name.

359
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:08,860
It is commonly said to be the first book in mathematics ever published in America.

360
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:14,860
His son, far better known than Benjamin Charles Sanders, got it reprinted about 10 years later

361
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,860
after his father had died, and then, in fact, put it into a book form made a number of changes

362
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,860
where it did gain some frequency, particularly in Europe.

363
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:30,860
I've even seen the statement that it is the first work in science to come out of the United States,

364
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:38,860
which meant that whoever wrote that hadn't heard of Benjamin Franklin, but that's a different issue.

365
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,860
There was a wonderful period when I could go around, and then the question became too well-known,

366
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,860
and I really enjoyed doing this with electrical engineers in this building,

367
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:52,860
and I'd say, who's the greatest electrical engineer ever associated with Penn?

368
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
And they wouldn't know.

369
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:58,860
And, of course, it was the inventor of the lightning rod and the words positive and negative

370
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:01,860
and conductance and resistance and all those words.

371
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,860
So, sorry.

372
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,860
Go on here.

373
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Where was I?

374
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Oh, just how the first book came in, but where was I?

375
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,860
I've lost track of what I was saying.

376
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:19,860
There's his name, at least.

377
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
That book, that sentence, rather.

378
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,860
I had no idea it was in that book.

379
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
That sentence.

380
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,860
Oh, let me say a little bit more about this.

381
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Sorry about that book.

382
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,860
It's fascinating because Benjamin Purse did have a lot to say about the philosophy of mathematics,

383
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,860
and his book is a counter-example to almost everything he said.

384
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:43,860
He amazingly was dedicated to applied mathematicians, mathematics.

385
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,860
This book, the linear associative algebra, I should tell you,

386
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:53,860
classified all associative algebras over the reels up to dimension six.

387
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
It created a subject.

388
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,860
Well, not quite the subject.

389
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,860
It may be in that generality it created it.

390
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:03,860
And it's the only thing that he did that was, the only important thing that he did that was actually

391
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,860
in pure mathematics as opposed to applied mathematics.

392
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:16,860
Quite remarkable how that work, which has his most famous single statement about the nature of mathematics,

393
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,860
was in fact a counter-example to his philosophy of mathematics.

394
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Now, there's a word in that line, which I want to take quite seriously.

395
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,860
Let me pause for a moment.

396
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,860
Gratton Guinness has published a very nice history of the work.

397
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
He got hold of some original manuscripts and whatnot.

398
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,860
And the word necessary comes in quite late.

399
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:44,860
For a while, it was mathematics is the subject which draws conclusions,

400
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,860
tried inferences, a few other things.

401
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:53,860
And apparently from some correspondence, he was troubled by the fact that the same thing could be said about law.

402
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,860
So he decided to put the word necessary in there.

403
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,860
Word necessary is not the same as arbitrary.

404
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,860
And in fact, of course, the words are different.

405
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,860
But in fact, it's easy to find counter-examples in each direction.

406
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,860
But it's similar.

407
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:08,860
It's in that nature.

408
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,860
But the more important word from my point of view is the word conclusions.

409
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,860
Because without theorems, there's no mathematics.

410
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,860
And so that has to be added to the mix.

411
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,860
It's not enough to say you're non-arbitrary.

412
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,860
You also have to have theorems.

413
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,860
So let me give an outrageous example.

414
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:34,860
If you want a lot of theorems, sorry, the other way,

415
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:39,860
if you want a lot of non-arbitraryness, just start with an empty theory, right?

416
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,860
And then you're totally non-arbitrary.

417
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860
You don't have to worry about anything.

418
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:48,860
So clearly you have to have some criterion for having theorems.

419
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,860
Couple that in.

420
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,860
The existence of theorems in the non-arbitraryness.

421
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:00,860
I don't think there's a huge mystery about the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.

422
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,860
First of all, it's worth noting that very small part of mathematics, I think,

423
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,860
ever finds an application.

424
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,860
See, there's a problem of perception here.

425
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,860
There's all sorts of areas of mathematics we've now totally forgotten about

426
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,860
because they've stopped doing theorems and they never found an application.

427
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:24,860
So one which I like to take as an example is finite geometry.

428
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Finite projective planes, for instance.

429
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,860
I don't think anybody has ever talked about a conceivable application for that subject.

430
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,860
The last, with one exception, the last theorem was proven probably well over 100 years ago.

431
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:44,860
The big question is, why is it that all finite projective planes have prime power order?

432
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,860
That's a matter of observation.

433
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Nobody's found a counter example.

434
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,860
Since I am talking about, let me say, the one exception was that about 20 years ago,

435
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,860
they did prove that there are no projective planes of order 10.

436
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Six is easy, comparatively.

437
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,860
10 is, took one hell of a lot of work.

438
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Tremendous amount of computer time.

439
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,860
I have a personal story.

440
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:14,860
I was having breakfast at John Thompson's place in, it was a Sunday morning in Cambridge

441
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
when, what's his first name?

442
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,860
He pronounces it McCoy, spells it McKay.

443
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,860
John McCoy came with a wonderful news that because of a lot of work of John Thompson,

444
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:29,860
they had reduced the question down to something that wouldn't cost more in computer time

445
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
than it had cost to get a man in the moon.

446
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,860
And so therefore one knows that we could do it, right?

447
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,860
In the next 10 years or so, actually it was about eight years,

448
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:43,860
the improvement of computers and the improvement of the method for search got down

449
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
so that in fact they got an answer.

450
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
12 is still open.

451
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,860
So it's a subject with essentially no theorems left.

452
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,860
And the other hand has consumed tremendous amount of time

453
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,860
on the part of mathematicians over the ages,

454
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,860
including what was almost certainly the history's greatest group theorist, John Thompson.

455
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,860
And in fact he will come in occasionally in the morning, he used to, and come in and said,

456
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
I was thinking about the problem again.

457
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,860
And the problem meant a projective geometry, finite projective geometry.

458
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,860
If you don't know what finite projective geometry is,

459
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,860
it doesn't matter, it has actually no relevance to what I've just been saying,

460
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,860
since it's never found an application.

461
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:30,860
But a certain minority of mathematics does find applications and it looks remarkable.

462
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:35,860
If you look at Wigner's paper, he points to these branches of mathematics

463
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,860
that had nothing to do with physics in the beginning,

464
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,860
nothing to do with the real world, and yet they became important in physics.

465
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,860
But they were non-arbitrary.

466
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Number one, number two, they had theorems.

467
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,860
Now the importance of theorems I think should be clear, but let's pause for a moment.

468
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,860
The group theory has had incredible number of applications.

469
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,860
And it's a subject which has just incredible theorems, right?

470
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,860
I mean, I think it strikes everybody.

471
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,860
Amazing, starting with so little, how much you get.

472
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,860
Well, group theory is officially a part of semi-group theory.

473
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:08,860
There is something called semi-group theory.

474
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,860
It has very few theorems that aren't about groups,

475
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:15,860
and yet the world has far more semi-groups than groups.

476
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:21,860
They're all over the place, and it's never become anything close to an applied subject.

477
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:26,860
Not peculiarly enough, if you even further generalize it,

478
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,860
and it's possible to view categories as a generalization of semi-groups,

479
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,860
then amazingly it finds applications.

480
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,860
Now having lived through this, having lived in a subject which was criticized

481
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,860
for being so far abstract that it couldn't possibly have anything to do with anything,

482
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,860
and then watching two different subjects, quite disparate,

483
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,860
physics, theoretical physics on one hand and computer science on the other,

484
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:51,860
finding applications of it,

485
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,860
but of course it was the theorems that got applied, not just the language.

486
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,860
It was the fact that there were theorems in each subject that were looked at

487
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:06,860
after the fact as if they were tailor-made for the application.

488
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:12,860
So I don't consider that a huge mystery, is what I'm saying.

489
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:16,860
But notice now that I've slipped in something here.

490
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:20,860
Notice that Purse's word was conclusions.

491
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,860
My word is theorems.

492
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
What's the difference?

493
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,860
There is certainly a difference.

494
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:33,860
There are all sorts of conclusions that none of us would call theorems.

495
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
And so what's the difference?

496
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:38,860
Well, interesting, interest.

497
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:44,860
So there's an aesthetic issue involved here.

498
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,860
Does it all come down to aesthetics?

499
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,860
I mean, what makes a theorem interesting?

500
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,860
Why do we tend to agree?

501
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Which is a remarkable amount of agreement compared with other subjects

502
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,860
on what's interesting and what isn't.

503
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,860
There could well be a philosophy of the aesthetics of mathematics.

504
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I'm not aware of it.

505
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,860
People are making aesthetic judgments all the time.

506
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:17,860
It's constantly being made while you're doing mathematics, while you're learning mathematics.

507
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,860
It is different.

508
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,860
Making the aesthetic judgment strikes me as something different

509
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,860
from studying the philosophy of such judgments.

510
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,860
That seems to be true everywhere you use the word aesthetics.

511
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:34,860
Let me pause just for a moment here, by the way, about what I intended to say this earlier,

512
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,860
since the notion of aesthetics has arisen.

513
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:44,860
That same line that John Isbell used, I don't know about that, but it is an arbitrary,

514
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,860
it can be used other places besides mathematics, you know, and I found it useful.

515
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:55,860
So right on this campus a few years ago, I discovered that architects are used to

516
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:04,860
explaining what they feel about aesthetics with the line that aesthetics are innate.

517
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,860
I said, I don't know if they're innate, I just quoted Isbell, it just changed the subject.

518
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,860
I don't know if aesthetics are innate, but I do know they're non-arbitrary.

519
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,860
And that's, of course, what they meant.

520
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:20,860
There's no need for them to be innate, they might be, who knows, it's irrelevant.

521
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:26,860
So let me, the notion of arbitrariness, of course, now I haven't paused over it.

522
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,860
I do need some special properties on this.

523
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:33,860
First of all, notice it's not dichotomous.

524
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,860
Some things are more arbitrary than others.

525
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,860
Chess is more arbitrary than go.

526
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:45,860
I found people who don't see that right away.

527
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:48,860
But think of the opening position in chess.

528
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:54,860
The whole bunch of arbitrary decisions were made in order to invent that opening position.

529
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,860
You could ask why are the bishops closer to the center of the board than the knights.

530
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:06,860
I don't think anybody ever, if there's any evidence that anybody ever experimented with the other possible opening positions, I've not found it.

531
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:10,860
And notice an experiment would be almost unbelievably difficult

532
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:18,860
because you'd have to wait a few hundred years to find out whether those opening positions led to interesting games, right?

533
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:26,860
Go seems to be almost entirely, there's one clearly arbitrary aspect of it, and that's the size of the board, 19 by 19.

534
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:29,860
There are some others, by the way, just to be sure here.

535
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,860
There are different ways of scoring.

536
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:37,860
They almost always agree on who the winner is, but there are different ways.

537
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,860
There are different ways of resolving the possibility of periodicities.

538
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:50,860
You might have a game that goes around in circles, and so you want something to prevent that, and there are some different choices.

539
00:36:50,860 --> 00:37:02,860
But interesting, in my looking at the literature on go, people who are serious about go seem to take those as variations of the game of go.

540
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:10,860
There are standard things, standard ways in which international championships are decided, but whatnot, but they are viewed as arbitrary.

541
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:20,860
So here's a case, notice that the notion of arbitrariness is you enhance the non-arbitrariness by generalizing,

542
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:24,860
but please keep in mind there are plenty of cases where it goes just the other way.

543
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:29,860
Clearly the single most non-arbitrary thing we study is the natural numbers.

544
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:34,860
And that's one, you know, it's categorical in the old-fashioned sense of the word.

545
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:42,860
There aren't any variations of what natural numbers means in the sense of number theory without an adjective in front of the word number.

546
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:52,860
So one has to tinker a bit with the notion of arbitrariness to begin to make this work.

547
00:37:53,860 --> 00:38:03,860
There is a thought experiment, but every so often I do meet somebody who I find resistant to this notion of what do I mean by arbitrariness.

548
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:10,860
Well there's a clear thought experiment which I know that I use, I'm not sure other people want to use it,

549
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:20,860
but the thought experiment I'm talking about is what do you expect when you talk to another intelligence species in another solar system?

550
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:27,860
You pretty much expect them to have a game of chess, but it won't be our game of chess, right?

551
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,860
I mean that sounds highly improbable that they would.

552
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:38,860
In fact, I think if we had chess with the same opening position we would immediately have evidence that we had a common ancestor somehow.

553
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:45,860
One other alternative you have to hold in mind, it is possible that there was an evolutionary process that games were experimented with

554
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,860
and it was settled on this one other than by accident.

555
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,860
Same thing by the way when it comes of course to physics, that's the better known case,

556
00:38:52,860 --> 00:39:00,860
that the things that are arbitrary in physics like the certain constants and things like that, this has received a lot of attention of course.

557
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:11,860
There's the anthropic view that we happen to be in one of many, many universes in which the constants are well designed for us to be in it and therefore to observe it.

558
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:17,860
There's the other possibility which I find much more enticing, but apparently it hasn't led anywhere,

559
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:23,860
that you want to define a structure which could evolve into the right constants.

560
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:29,860
So the one that first attracted me early enough, I mean it seems awfully arbitrary to me initially,

561
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:33,860
that the dimension of the space we live in is three.

562
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:40,860
Now what we mean by dimension has radically changed, so mathematicians want to say dimension in the small or in the large or something.

563
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,860
This turns out to be dimension in the middle somewhere, right?

564
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:49,860
So the perceptual dimension I guess is what I want to say, is one possible way of saying it.

565
00:39:49,860 --> 00:40:00,860
You can argue easily enough that if the dimension went three then you wouldn't expect something like the inverse square law for a force.

566
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:08,860
But if you're thinking of dimension as only integer valued as not something that can vary continuously in some sense,

567
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,860
then that sounds too arbitrary.

568
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,860
So therefore have some nature of space in which you can have fractional dimensions,

569
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:22,860
and of course the relevant notion is something called Hausdorff dimension, whatever that is.

570
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:30,860
Yeah, it's essentially the relationship between the radius of a sphere and the amount of how much it contains.

571
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:36,860
And that you would like some picture, some system in which you could argue that if it varied away from dimension three,

572
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:41,860
things would cause it to bounce back, to come back to dimension three,

573
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:49,860
that if you got over dimension three then the forces would dissipate too quickly, that sort of thing.

574
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:56,860
And you would then maybe end up with a picture of space, of all the physics maybe, in which nothing was arbitrary.

575
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:02,860
And in that case I would say we would start thinking of it as a branch of mathematics.

576
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:04,860
That hasn't happened yet.

577
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,860
So we have to patch up the notion of arbitrary to make this work,

578
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:13,860
and you can't escape the fact that you're going to end up deciding that things are interesting or not,

579
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,860
and that that's an important part of it.

580
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,860
The importance of by the way of being interesting,

581
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,860
if you want one hell of a lot of theorems,

582
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,860
and you don't care, maybe I should say conclusions,

583
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:28,860
and not care about the interest,

584
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,860
then it's perfectly simple what you want to do.

585
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,860
You want to adopt an inconsistent theory,

586
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,860
and then you can prove everything, right?

587
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:44,860
You'd have all the theorems you ever could, conclusions perhaps I should say you'll ever need.

588
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:47,860
So there's an interplay there,

589
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,860
and so the whole thing may be a cheat, what I'm preaching.

590
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,860
And that's a possibility that I'm afraid does occur to me.

591
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,860
I want shortly to open up to questions,

592
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,860
because I think that'll be a lot more interesting than me keep expounding on these things.

593
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,860
But I do want to mention, maybe I know, let me do that.

594
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:09,860
I have a coda that can come later.

595
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,860
So let me stop now,

596
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,860
and nobody is objected yet to anything I've said.

597
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,860
Let's object or do something.

598
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,860
No questions?

599
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,860
Yeah, Zeldin.

600
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,860
You mentioned mathematics is not arbitrary.

601
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,860
Right.

602
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:30,860
That's a slick description of the object that I'm now addressing you.

603
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,860
Could you say, well, it's objected in some sense.

604
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:39,860
So not arbitrary, but a little more like objected in some point or another.

605
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:42,860
So the question is, for the record,

606
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,860
what's this have to do with objectivity?

607
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
I haven't the slightest idea.

608
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
What does that mean in this context?

609
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,860
It just means that now we can talk about mathematical truth and other things,

610
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,860
similar to what we've talked about in the experiment last time.

611
00:42:58,860 --> 00:43:04,860
Truth, as opposed to having necessary conclusions.

612
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Exactly.

613
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,860
It strikes me as a separate question.

614
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:16,860
I think you're asking what's the validity of logic for something.

615
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:23,860
I mean, is there some kind of a, I don't know, let's say, continuum hypothesis.

616
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:32,860
Somehow, should we have a way which we would say is correct?

617
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:37,860
Okay, I'm going to have to answer the question again for the record is,

618
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,860
do I have anything to say about, say, the truth of the continuum hypothesis?

619
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,860
Exactly.

620
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,860
That would be an application.

621
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,860
That would be a nice one.

622
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,860
So let me expound just a bit on that.

623
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:53,860
I have, as Zoltan surely knows, a view about the foundations of mathematics that may not,

624
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,860
I think, is becoming standard over time.

625
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,860
So let me just talk about this just for a moment.

626
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,860
By and large, the practice of mathematics was remarkably free of foundations.

627
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,860
The semantics of the subject matter for most mathematicians was irrelevant.

628
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,860
They had a semantics.

629
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:17,860
They felt they knew what they were talking about when they were talking about the natural numbers, for instance.

630
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:23,860
Albeit, there were some areas that came up particularly in analysis roughly 100 years ago

631
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:26,860
that seemed to be more complicated than that.

632
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,860
When we came, and this turned out not to be mathematics,

633
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:36,860
but when there arose a subject in which the semantics was not at all clear,

634
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,860
namely computer science, set theory was found to be useless.

635
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:45,860
And so we had to look entirely elsewhere for semantics,

636
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,860
in which the continuum hypothesis appears to be totally irrelevant.

637
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,860
Okay, so that's that first thing.

638
00:44:52,860 --> 00:45:01,860
Now, I was, as indicated in the introduction, in the business of building devices where you can vary.

639
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:06,860
So I usually describe it as what happened to geometry in the 19th century,

640
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,860
happened to foundations in the 20th century.

641
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,860
You took a much more expansive view.

642
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,860
It wasn't a single foundations.

643
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,860
There were many foundations.

644
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:20,860
You would pick the one that you wanted to make interesting theorems.

645
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,860
So watch what happened.

646
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:28,860
I mean, look what happened in the 19th century for geometry.

647
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,860
It started, I think it's fair to say,

648
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:33,860
it turns out you can find some earlier antecedents for this,

649
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:38,860
but by and large it was the case that in the year 1800 there was Euclidean,

650
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:39,860
they didn't need the word Euclidean.

651
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:40,860
There was geometry.

652
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,860
It's what we now call Euclidean geometry.

653
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,860
You didn't have to worry about alternatives.

654
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:47,860
In the middle of the century, people found that there were,

655
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,860
wanted to explore alternative geometries.

656
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:53,860
And by the end of the century, people no longer believe

657
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:57,860
that the original one was describing this real world.

658
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,860
Which I think I pointed out actually is a not a well posed question

659
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,860
until you say which physics you're going to use

660
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:06,860
to decide whether it's describing it or not.

661
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:09,860
But now let me point out that Kant was essentially right,

662
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:12,860
albeit not when it came to the specific things about

663
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,860
the analyticity and synthetic and all that stuff.

664
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,860
There was something special about Euclidean geometry.

665
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,860
It was, in fact, it is.

666
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:22,860
Let me use the present tense.

667
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:26,860
It is less arbitrary than the other geometries.

668
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:29,860
I don't think you have to say it's innate.

669
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:35,860
I think it is simply the fact that it's reasonably clear to me

670
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,860
that this may be peculiar.

671
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,860
I may have trouble defending this,

672
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,860
but to say that space is positively curved or negatively curved,

673
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:45,860
they both sound like arbitrary decisions where to say

674
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,860
it has no curvature, it all sounds unarbitrary.

675
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:51,860
I do know that as a very young kid,

676
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:55,860
a friend and I measured the circumference of a tree

677
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:58,860
and wondered what the diameter was,

678
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:03,860
and said, well, we took a little fruit juice glass

679
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,860
and measured it there and saw it was about three to one,

680
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,860
and we're happy with that answer.

681
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,860
It never occurred to either of us,

682
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,860
and we had to be told years later

683
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,860
that we could have been living in a space

684
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,860
in which that ratio between diameter and circumference

685
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:20,860
was dependent on scale, that it wasn't constant.

686
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:24,860
So that sounded arbitrary, right?

687
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,860
Whereas sort of the neutral decision

688
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,860
was to say that it's constant.

689
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:30,860
And it seems to me there are a lot of things like that

690
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:34,860
that tell you that classical geometry was the least arbitrary.

691
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:38,860
If you had to settle on one, that would be it.

692
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,860
I don't think it has to do with...

693
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,860
Well, it's reasonably clear to me

694
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:46,860
that if we lived in a space of non-zero curvature,

695
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,860
we would build our blackboards to have zero curvature.

696
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,860
We would need it to teach calculus.

697
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:54,860
That's right.

698
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:00,860
That requires a zero curvature plane.

699
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:04,860
So back to the continuum hypothesis.

700
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,860
I don't think it's a well-posed question, as stated.

701
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:11,860
I think there is a non-arbitrary notion of a minimal set theory,

702
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,860
which allows things like the axioms of ZF,

703
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,860
and I'm willing to bet anybody

704
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:20,860
that will eventually be shown to satisfy the continuum hypothesis.

705
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,860
At that last, I'm not sure of,

706
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:27,860
but I reasonably would expect it, I think.

707
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:30,860
I'd put odds on it, put it that way.

708
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,860
But you are making an arbitrary decision

709
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,860
when you say, which set theory are you looking at?

710
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,860
And so it is not an absolute question, as posed.

711
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:43,860
It seems to me that the continuum hypothesis,

712
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:46,860
you do need some other stuff you have to state

713
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,860
to ask whether or not it's true.

714
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:56,860
So these relationships in and out of the subject.

715
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,860
So no, I'm not sure what I have to say about objectivity.

716
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,860
I think you still will strive for non-arbitrary.

717
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,860
And in fact, it would appear to,

718
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,860
when you listen to the people in that business,

719
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,860
as we had this conference on set theory last term,

720
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,860
and in previous ones, people are looking for,

721
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:18,860
if you look at it, are looking for non-arbitrary principles

722
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,860
that would give you an answer.

723
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,860
Because the continuum hypothesis, as it is,

724
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,860
sounds too arbitrary.

725
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,860
You have to say what it is you want your set theory to do

726
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,860
before you're going to be able to answer the question.

727
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:31,860
Yeah, yeah.

728
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,860
So you can tell me as people that are skeptical

729
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,860
about non-arbitrary.

730
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,860
So when you first described it,

731
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,860
it sounded like you had a theory about,

732
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:41,860
you know, a goal versus chess,

733
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,860
and it sounded like this,

734
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,860
and I do symmetry and degeneracy and things like this.

735
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,860
But now in response to Zoltan, you said,

736
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:49,860
well, you certainly have the feeling of mess in us.

737
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,860
But we know, you know, there's all these experiments

738
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,860
that show, for example, most people find

739
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:58,860
a risk between physics more natural than any physics.

740
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,860
So if you show them, you know, a ball going through a pipe,

741
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,860
or a water going through a pipe that's curved,

742
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,860
they'll think it's going to keep being curved when it comes out.

743
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,860
We know that people find teleological explanations

744
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,860
more natural than they make realistic ones.

745
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,860
So why trust our judgment about,

746
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,860
I mean, we really come down to what we take to be natural.

747
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:18,860
Why trust that this is relevant to the subject

748
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:20,860
that we're talking about?

749
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:22,860
I didn't use the word natural.

750
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,860
I don't think...

751
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,860
This real world is very arbitrary.

752
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,860
So I guess I didn't say that.

753
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:35,860
Perhaps I should have.

754
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,860
When you talk about what's true in this particular world,

755
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,860
that strikes me already as an arbitrary decision

756
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:42,860
having been made.

757
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,860
That at the moment is the difference between physics,

758
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,860
the most clear difference between physics and mathematics,

759
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:52,860
is precisely that.

760
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,860
Physics is about a particular world

761
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:58,860
in which you can do experiments and things like that.

762
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,860
I said it's possible that physics will develop

763
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,860
to a point where all the peculiarities of this real world,

764
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,860
well, maybe not all, but a huge amount of them

765
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:10,860
can be explained away as arbitrary, non-arbitrary.

766
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:21,860
So yes, somebody better hold of what is meant by arbitrary.

767
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,860
So this is work in process.

768
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,860
In process, whatever the right word is there.

769
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:36,860
The fact that the ordinary human brain

770
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,860
has certain funny ways of doing it strikes me

771
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,860
as an arbitrary fact about the nature of human brains

772
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,860
more than that, so it doesn't bother me terribly.

773
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:46,860
In fact, one can make a very good argument

774
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,860
that most of the history of science

775
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:50,860
is to refute common sense.

776
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:59,860
But in doing so, you're trying to go by the folklore aspect of it.

777
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,860
That's arbitrary.

778
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,860
Whereas when it reaches by trying to use it

779
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:04,860
based on some sort of experimental evidence,

780
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:07,860
I think you're reaching there for less arbitrariness.

781
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,860
But again, that's not mathematics.

782
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,860
If you want to allow the possibility

783
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,860
that there's another intelligent species somewhere

784
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:20,860
that can include, their number theory will have different,

785
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:22,860
some of their theorems and number theory

786
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,860
will contradict our theorems and number theory,

787
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,860
then I don't know what I could say to you.

788
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:30,860
I mean, that is a possibility, I suppose.

789
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:34,860
But I wouldn't consider it a realistic one.

790
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:38,860
So that's not, I'm saying why I'm not answering the question.

791
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,860
Yeah.

792
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
I have a slightly different question

793
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:42,860
towards that argument.

794
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,860
So you started off saying mathematics is one way of thinking

795
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:46,860
about mathematics as being non-arbitrary.

796
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,860
So that's from sort of the data,

797
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,860
sort of continuum of cases with like KS and Go.

798
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:52,860
Right.

799
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,860
So I guess the question now is,

800
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,860
in my mind, is the boundary around mathematics,

801
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:58,860
you know, how arbitrary counts as mathematics,

802
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:00,860
is that arbitrary?

803
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:01,860
Well, as I said.

804
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,860
Where do we start?

805
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:03,860
Where do we start with the game?

806
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:04,860
No, no.

807
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:05,860
There's no problems.

808
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:08,860
If you forget about the necessity for theorems,

809
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,860
then I pointed out you could go all the way to non-arbitrary

810
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:12,860
and have no theorems.

811
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,860
All the way to non-arbitrary.

812
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,860
And then if you forget about the interest involved,

813
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,860
you can do the same thing.

814
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,860
Let me go back to chess and Go and whatnot.

815
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:28,860
If you proved, this isn't precisely an answer to your question,

816
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:32,860
but if somebody proved that, say,

817
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,860
there was a strategy to win in chess for the first player,

818
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,860
for white.

819
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,860
And the fact that you could prove that existence

820
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,860
doesn't mean that you could actually get hold of it, right?

821
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,860
I mean, there are games that you can prove

822
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,860
there's a strategy for one player or the other,

823
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,860
and yet you have no idea what the strategy is.

824
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:54,860
I don't think that would be considered a mathematical result.

825
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,860
I don't think it would be considered a result in mathematics,

826
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:01,860
in fact, in ordinary usage.

827
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:05,860
Same with Go unless you remove the 19.

828
00:54:05,860 --> 00:54:09,860
If you had a theorem about Go which was for an arbitrary shape,

829
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,860
well, I said shape there, let's start with a square board,

830
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,860
but of arbitrary size.

831
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,860
It would begin to sound more like mathematics,

832
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,860
still not mathematics.

833
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:23,860
If you then had a theorem about Go played on an arbitrary graph

834
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,860
on a plane, and if you have the necessary and sufficient

835
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,860
conditions, a nice statement of the necessary and sufficient

836
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,860
conditions for that graph to determine who has a strategy.

837
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,860
That, I think, would be accepted as a result in mathematics.

838
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,860
Would we expect to do that for some kind of extra threshold

839
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,860
and then we might properly division in the second place?

840
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:46,860
Yeah.

841
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:50,860
Yeah, I would.

842
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,860
It's a hand that it wasn't.

843
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,860
So again, I'm not sure if I'm answering your questions,

844
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,860
but as I said, this is a work in progress or process,

845
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:05,860
whichever word is relevant there.

846
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,860
Is that a hand?

847
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:09,860
Do I have to answer a question?

848
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,860
Ask a question?

849
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,860
Yeah.

850
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,860
Very.

851
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,860
Maybe I'm mishearing you, but there seem to be say,

852
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:19,860
sorry, set of mathematics is defined by the questions you ask.

853
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,860
I just said it was the theorems you end up with.

854
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,860
Oh, OK.

855
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,860
So, yes, I certainly am.

856
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,860
I think that's unavoidable.

857
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,860
I mean, I don't know a human endeavor, which isn't,

858
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:34,860
intellectual endeavor, which isn't so defined.

859
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,860
By the way, for the record, is mathematics defined by the questions

860
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:38,860
that are asked?

861
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:39,860
Yeah, of course.

862
00:55:39,860 --> 00:56:08,860
Yeah, the questions that pose themselves are the non-arbitrary ones.

863
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,860
That's what makes them, that's how you know that they're posed,

864
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,860
that they answer, that they pose themselves.

865
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,860
It's because of their very non-arbitraryness.

866
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:21,860
The questions we end up asking for practice, the finger exercises,

867
00:56:21,860 --> 00:56:26,860
those are arbitrary until we get to the really good questions.

868
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:42,860
In theory.

869
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:47,860
Of course, I wouldn't, in fact, I, well, OK, now,

870
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,860
see, there's another huge problem,

871
00:56:50,860 --> 00:56:54,860
which I thought I would try to subsume by that notion of interest,

872
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:57,860
maybe.

873
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:01,860
You know, everything in mathematics is a totology.

874
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,860
And that's not, of course, at all what we mean.

875
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,860
That's a different subject.

876
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,860
There is a huge difference between arbitrary totologies

877
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,860
and the things that we call, maybe in theory,

878
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,860
all the theorems are totologies.

879
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,860
But not all totologies are theorems, right?

880
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,860
So, yes, I mean, so let's take the example people usually point to,

881
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:26,860
and that's the game invented, among others, by John Nash.

882
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,860
In fact, by the way, just for the, just since we're on the subject,

883
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:36,860
there is a scene in the movie where they don't say they're playing go.

884
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,860
You're supposed to assume they're playing go.

885
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:41,860
And Nash, the young Nash as a student at Princeton is upset

886
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,860
because the first player should win.

887
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:51,860
Now, it's, what's clear at the go board is it has far too many stones on it.

888
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:57,860
So it can't be go, because serious go players would never still be playing

889
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:00,860
without many stones left on the board.

890
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,860
So I thought, oh, this is, that Nash must have,

891
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:08,860
when Nash invented his game, which I won't try to describe here,

892
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,860
he did play it on a go board, and he supplied the proof

893
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:17,860
using some algebraic topology that there had to be a strategy for the first player.

894
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:23,860
I actually got hold of the scriptwriters on that one, and I was wrong.

895
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,860
They said they put that many stones on the go board because they looked nicer,

896
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,860
and they said, but in fact they did film some other scenes

897
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,860
in which Nash goes and invents the game of go, of Nash.

898
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:42,860
And so they, I was wrong in my inference on it.

899
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:45,860
Let me describe a game that's simpler to describe.

900
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,860
In fact, you've all played it.

901
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:54,860
It's Japanese name is Gomoku, and it's a wonderful pun there.

902
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,860
The word go is the Japanese word for five.

903
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,860
It is also the word for small stones.

904
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,860
And it's, in the first case, it describes the standard game of go.

905
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,860
This is a different game played with the same stones on the same board, right?

906
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,860
And it's five in a row.

907
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:13,860
You've all played it by every culture, I think, that's around to inventing that game.

908
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,860
You play on a rectilinear grid.

909
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,860
You don't have to specify the size.

910
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:19,860
Take it to be unbounded size.

911
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:23,860
And first player who gets five in a row of his color wins.

912
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,860
This is one in which it's easy to prove.

913
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:30,860
Sorry, chances are probably there's a strategy for both sides to draw.

914
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,860
So let me be careful how I state this.

915
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,860
It's easy to prove that there is no strategy for the second player to win.

916
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:41,860
Because you have a little construction, you take any possible strategy for the second player to win,

917
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,860
and you can quickly convert it into one for the first player to win.

918
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,860
So therefore, there couldn't have been one for the second player to win.

919
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:51,860
If you could supply the fact that the game must terminate,

920
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,860
then you would have a strategy for the first player.

921
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:55,860
The game of Nash has that nice feature.

922
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,860
Again, because of a little algebraic topology,

923
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,860
you know that there has to be a winner if they play long enough.

924
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:05,860
And that's where the algebraic topology comes in.

925
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:08,860
Notice there's nothing like an enumeration here.

926
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,860
And therefore, these are mildly interesting theorems.

927
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,860
If they were obtained by enumeration, they wouldn't be interesting theorems.

928
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:19,860
So part of the word interest there has to do with the proof, the nature of the proof.

929
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:28,860
And since, I mean, there should be someday a philosophy of the aesthetics of mathematics,

930
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:33,860
the most people would ask, what's the word of aesthetics that mathematicians are most apt to use,

931
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,860
say, well, the word is clearly elegant.

932
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,860
Well, not true if you think about it.

933
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,860
The word is interesting.

934
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:43,860
You're using it so often, you don't even notice it as an aesthetic judgment.

935
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:48,860
And there are all sorts of theorems that are very interesting, which are totally inelegant,

936
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:54,860
because the interest will tend to come from the fact that they have a lot of nice corollaries,

937
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,860
and they tell you about a lot.

938
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,860
And then there are a few things, like the theorem I just described, without going into the details,

939
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:06,860
in which the interest is very limited, but it has a nice, elegant little proof comes out.

940
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,860
I mean, Nash as a student came up with.

941
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:16,860
By and large, if a speaker in mathematics starts with the fact that the theorem I'm going to prove

942
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:23,860
isn't all that interesting, but the proof is interesting, you know that you might find an excuse to get out of the room.

943
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:28,860
This is usually a cop-out for not having an interesting theorem.

944
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,860
But this is a good part of it.

945
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:38,860
So the complication coming in from this notion of interest is going to be a devious complication.

946
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,860
It can rest on the nature of the proof.

947
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:46,860
There are things that mathematicians, theorems that mathematicians in particular like to tell each other,

948
01:01:46,860 --> 01:01:50,860
and the theorems are uninteresting, but they have wonderful little proofs.

949
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:55,860
And so this is a part of it.

950
01:01:55,860 --> 01:02:00,860
And as I say, it's one that I can only say, well, maybe this isn't even philosophical anymore.

951
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:06,860
Maybe aesthetic judgments themselves, the actual judgments, aren't part of philosophy.

952
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,860
Yeah?

953
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,860
Not easy.

954
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,860
Take some work.

955
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:17,860
That's okay, right?

956
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:20,860
I mean, but you quite right.

957
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:25,860
It may not be anywhere near as arbitrary as we think, but you certainly in hell can strive for it.

958
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,860
That's clear.

959
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:36,860
So yes, if you want to, I would be willing to modify or put this in as a caveat that quite possibly is all terribly arbitrary.

960
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:41,860
But what you're trying to be as unarbitrary as possible.

961
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:47,860
I don't, well, if I'm prepared to say that that is the same as non-arbitrary,

962
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,860
now that's not what Platonism meant.

963
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:53,860
So I don't think I need Platonism there.

964
01:02:53,860 --> 01:03:00,860
For the, I mean, the fact that mathematicians often become Platonists,

965
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:08,860
it's the same phenomenon that a playwright, let's say, more, let me say scriptwriter rather than playwright,

966
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:14,860
often finds that the dialogue is writing itself, particularly if you're doing soap operas and things like that, right?

967
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,860
I mean, he's sitting there in the dialogues writing itself.

968
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,860
They never fall into the trap of thinking therefore the characters exist.

969
01:03:22,860 --> 01:03:25,860
Mathematicians do.

970
01:03:26,860 --> 01:03:32,860
I mean, leave me, I do have a coda as it were.

971
01:03:32,860 --> 01:03:39,860
So let me just be, before we, let's stop the questioning a little bit before, ah, it's 20 of 6 already.

972
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,860
Yeah, there was a hand up there.

973
01:03:56,860 --> 01:04:01,860
Well, for, okay, first of all, no, you can't.

974
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:04,860
I mean, nobody's got a good theorem proving program.

975
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:06,860
There are profound problems there.

976
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:11,860
They're usually most understood to be or summarized by the phrase problem of equality.

977
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:16,860
Mathematicians are constantly saying this is the same as that when they don't, when you don't, you know,

978
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,860
it's very nebulous what they're saying at that point.

979
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,860
There are two uses of the word proof.

980
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:32,860
When, when I say I can prove or let's be more accurate, Tarski proved that there is a proof that, um,

981
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:35,860
we have to be careful, Tarski didn't prove it.

982
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:45,860
A corollary of what Tarski proved proves that there aren't any 16 dimensional division algebras

983
01:04:45,860 --> 01:04:48,860
associative or not over the algebraic reels.

984
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:52,860
Why? Because Tarski proved that that's a decidable theory,

985
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:56,860
and the decisions only depend upon the definition of real closed field,

986
01:04:56,860 --> 01:05:00,860
and it was proven for the real field using a lot of topology.

987
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:03,860
That's right. So, which wouldn't apply at all to the algebraic reels.

988
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:07,860
Okay, so the inner proof is a technical notion.

989
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:10,860
You find out, you notice that this is a first order statement and all that.

990
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:16,860
The outer thing, Tarski proved, that's the, that's the, the, the real notion, the, the public notion,

991
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,860
or you're usually using, and we're nowhere near that.

992
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:27,860
Um, I have this peculiar assertion that that proof, those proofs, the ones that live in real life,

993
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:32,860
exist in fact only in their performance and what's written as a score thereof.

994
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,860
And that's why, well, that's, that's a whole nother lecture.

995
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:38,860
But, but, that's a very informal notion.

996
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:43,860
So, in fact, the proofs we actually use to convince each other that, that proofs may exist.

997
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,860
Uh, yes, I would like to see a program doing something.

998
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,860
I would like to see a machine develop a personnel.

999
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:51,860
I would like to see persons reciting in machines.

1000
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:56,860
I don't, I think they're of the same, they'll happen about the same time.

1001
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:01,860
I would guess that we'll have machines that can make us the same, similar aesthetic judgments

1002
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:05,860
about theorems as humans that, when we have theorems that we recognize as persons,

1003
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:08,860
when we have machines that we recognize as persons.

1004
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:13,860
Um, one, one more hand.

1005
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:15,860
Then I've got my coda, yeah.

1006
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:24,860
You've anticipated my coda.

1007
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:29,860
I will not repeat the question for the record because it will sound like it's a total.

1008
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:32,860
Okay, so the coda is the following.

1009
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,860
There was a name, there was a name missing from that list.

1010
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:40,860
Um, that I started with.

1011
01:06:40,860 --> 01:06:45,860
There was a philosopher, professor of philosophy at Brown University named John Ladd.

1012
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:50,860
Over the years, I've met a remarkable number of people who were strongly influenced by John Ladd

1013
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:53,860
in all sorts of subjects, by the way.

1014
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:55,860
I never took a course from him.

1015
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:57,860
Uh, never really sat at his feet.

1016
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,860
But he, I was one of many that he had a something of a good influence on.

1017
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:05,860
I think the second week I was at Brown,

1018
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:09,860
he sat down next to me, he was chief resident fellow,

1019
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:17,860
and he considered it part of his job to eat lunch with the students in the big dining room we all ate lunch in

1020
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:19,860
in those days.

1021
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,860
Uh, and so he sat down next to me.

1022
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:31,860
Now, I, I begin by talking about, we have, we have to find ways to explain to other people what it is that

1023
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:32,860
mathematicians do.

1024
01:07:32,860 --> 01:07:35,860
Philosophers have to do the same thing, of course.

1025
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:41,860
Uh, there's a huge difference between the public view of, well, if you, I did an inadvertent experiment years ago,

1026
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:46,860
which I've repeated a number of times, say to the first time it was with some high school students,

1027
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:54,860
and I was casually mentioned a philosopher I knew, I said a professional, professional philosopher,

1028
01:07:54,860 --> 01:07:57,860
and that phrase got a rise, professional philosopher.

1029
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,860
How could there be such things, right?

1030
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:04,860
I mean, they were aware of some great philosophers, but you know a, you know, that same sort of thing.

1031
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:16,860
And I think, uh, so let's see, by the time I was a freshman, I think I had some awareness that professors of philosophy wrote papers,

1032
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:23,860
and as far as I could tell, though, all they did was refute other philosophers.

1033
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:25,860
And so I said that.

1034
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:34,860
What I said to him was, what's it like being a member of a profession in which your reputation rests on your ability to refute others?

1035
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:41,860
And he proceeded to tell me about synthesis and tithesis, I should say, thesis and tithesis and synthesis,

1036
01:08:41,860 --> 01:08:49,860
taking as his main example Thomas, synthesizing essentially the Greek thought and the Christian thought.

1037
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:55,860
Um, well, that's just the beginning of the story.

1038
01:08:55,860 --> 01:09:00,860
Some weeks later, but again, it was my first semester at Brown.

1039
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:06,860
Also at lunch, but a more formal occasion, I find myself sitting next to someone.

1040
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,860
No, I don't know who it was.

1041
01:09:09,860 --> 01:09:11,860
I didn't know who it was even the next day.

1042
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:14,860
I don't think I ever saw him again.

1043
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:17,860
I'm assuming he was a philosopher.

1044
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:25,860
To make conversation with me, he said, what do you think about logicism and formalism and intuitionism?

1045
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:32,860
And I said, oh, I think they should be synthesized.

1046
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:36,860
And he immediately got a different expression on his face.

1047
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:42,860
He actually started, you know, maybe I should listen to this person's sort of expression.

1048
01:09:42,860 --> 01:09:45,860
And he said, that's very interesting.

1049
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:49,860
And there was a quietness.

1050
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:54,860
I mean, I was supposed to say something and so, I didn't know really what the words meant.

1051
01:09:54,860 --> 01:10:00,860
I think I had heard the words and I had some very vague idea of what they referred to.

1052
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:09,860
But I did know that in the 19th century, they had learned to model these different kinds of geometry in each other.

1053
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:18,860
So I said, well, I said, surely we will learn to reduce each of them to any of the other two, right?

1054
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:25,860
I mean, so any question of one can be translated into a question in the other.

1055
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:38,860
Yeah, I mean, it turns out that to make that process easy turned out to be a good hunk of the research of Alex of Andre Shedroff and I.

1056
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:44,860
Just to do that sort of thing.

1057
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,860
But I didn't know that then.

1058
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:50,860
But then I did say, I only recently remembered all this again.

1059
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:55,860
I mean, I didn't remember it over and over the years.

1060
01:10:55,860 --> 01:11:02,860
I said, of course, when you translate a question from one place to the other, it can look quite different.

1061
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:07,860
And in fact, if you didn't know what the original question is, it wouldn't look interesting.

1062
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:17,860
And so I said, but of course, that shows you that the real issue is what do you find interesting?

1063
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:20,860
I'd forgotten temporarily this for you.

1064
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:28,860
So in other words, I've just come back to where I was at the age of, I mean, the first freshman year, which also, of course, might mean that I didn't come back to it.

1065
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,860
It was always there and this is biased my whole approach, right?

1066
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:42,860
But I'm prepared, at least for the near future, to continue to defend the principle that finally what we really have to do is say, what do we find interesting and why?

1067
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,860
And that should be the rest of the subject of mathematics.

1068
01:11:46,860 --> 01:11:48,860
I guess that's the end.

1069
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,860
Thank you.

1070
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:52,860
Good.

1071
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,860
Center time.
