Checking multiverses/Thinking Beyond Language â€” Anna Ivanova on what LLMs can learn from the Brain.txt
1. **Language Models' Capabilities**: Recent advancements in language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 demonstrate an impressive ability to understand and generate human-like text, showcasing the complexity of language and the potential of AI to learn from data without strict internal rules.

2. **Modularity in AI**: The debate on whether LLMs should be built with architectural modularity (separate modules for different tasks) or if modules can emerge from training (emergent modularity) is ongoing. Human brains serve as an example of complex functions arising from a modular but not predefined architecture.

3. **Emergent Modularity**: This approach involves training a single network and allowing it to self-specialize into different functional areas, which might require adjustments in the architecture, objectives, or training data to promote specialized performance.

4. **AI Field's Evolution**: The AI field has shifted from simple scaling up of models towards specialized fine tuning, coupling LLMs with external modules, and adopting systems like RAG, which aligns with the suggestions made in the paper on formal and functional competence.

5. **Balanced Perspective**: It's crucial to maintain a balanced view of AI capabilities, recognizing both the strengths and limitations of current models. Overemphasis on either the positive or negative aspects can lead to unrealistic expectations or unnecessary caution.

6. **Future Directions**: The future of LLMs seems promising as researchers continue to explore the best methods for evaluating and improving these models, ensuring they are used effectively and responsibly.

In summary, the progress in language models is a testament to the power of data-driven learning, but as we move forward, it's essential to consider how modularity can enhance AI's capabilities and ensure that our evaluations of these models remain grounded in a realistic understanding of their strengths and weaknesses.
