00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,960
Hello and welcome. Today I will be extending my coverage of the CTMU a long overdue video

2
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,120
on what is the real breakthrough of the CTMU in terms of metaphysics, in terms of science,

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:32,360
in terms of philosophy, in terms of all fields of science and reality theory. The big breakthrough

4
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:40,240
of the CTMU, the title of the tazer, will be the CTMU breakthrough. Reality is a language.

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,960
The thesis is that the CTMU is a living model of reality, a model which is the same as reality

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,720
itself, which provides a breakthrough for all fields of science and philosophy as well

7
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:59,280
as theology, being a super tautology of all of reality itself. The key insight, the key insight

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,800
is that reality is a language and language is a reality. Reality is a language and language is

9
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:14,320
reality. This insight has three main components that I think are critical to it, and there's many

10
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,200
more things in the CTMU itself to describe this, but I break it down into three components. The

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,240
first one is isomorphism, I will describe each of these below, but the first point is isomorphism,

12
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,960
I'll describe this below. Second, distribution of logic over dualisms, distribution of language or

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,920
logic over dualisms, and three, the coupling of objects with universe or multiplex unity,

14
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:43,920
Hologi. Before I get bogged down into the details, I like to say that this is very difficult. It's

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,840
very, if you understand these three components though, then you understand the key breakthrough

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,800
to the CTMU, and to simplify it, and if you want to press your friends by saying it, just say,

17
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:57,600
the CTMU holds that reality is a language and language is a reality. But the first point,

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,040
isomorphism. So Langen gets into a saying called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics,

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,760
the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. So how is the mathematics can describe the way a

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,240
rocket launches, or can describe the way the economy functions, or the way the tide comes in

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,000
physics, or the way that a bicycle accelerates, or a car accelerates, or a runner, or a football,

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,520
or a tennis ball. How does mathematics describe all these physical events so well? How does it,

23
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:34,080
if it were, if it were decoupled from these events, then it would have no way of communicating the

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,520
ideas into your mind. And then what the phrase I like to say is, how is there isomorphism between

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,680
chicken, and I'll describe it with isomorphism. But how is there isomorphism between chicken

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
scratches writing, chicken scratch writing, like my handwriting looks like chicken scratches,

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,200
it's very messy. How is there isomorphism between chicken scratch writing and rocket launches?

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,480
So if I'm a physicist writing out a formula, how do I, how do my chicken, the squeal lines I make

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,280
on a piece of paper, how do they comport to the rocket launch? How do they communicate to me

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,880
what's happening in the rocket launch, or what's happening in my local grocery store with the,

31
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:18,000
with an economic function, or spline man curve? How does it work so well? We know that they are

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,160
more than just chicken scratches, they are more than just gibberish, they are a language, a

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,320
functioning language. So this language that you write out is isomorphic to the physical events

34
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,880
that surrounds you, and it communicates these events to you. What is isomorphism, isomorphism

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:42,320
I mean, I might prescribe a diagram perhaps here of what isomorphism is, I S O M O R P H I S M isomorphism.

36
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,960
So it has a block, so you have a block and a pyramid, the points at these aren't these aren't

37
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,960
language term, these aren't language terms, but I'll just use them here, the points attributes

38
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:58,160
and properties of the block correspond verbatim to the points attributes and properties of the

39
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,680
pyramid. So it's using mathematics, if you have a block and a pyramid, the points attributes and

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,680
properties of the block comport or translate verbatim to the points attributes and properties of the

41
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,160
pyramid, that's isomorphism. So as it comes to language, excuse me,

42
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:24,400
as it comes to language, how do these square lines, this language that I'm writing out,

43
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,560
this formula, this equation that I'm writing out for economics or rocket launches or acceleration

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,080
of cars or planes, airplanes or bicycles or tennis balls or soccer balls, this language that

45
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,800
I'm writing out with my chicken scratches isomorphically verbatim describes the rocket launch

46
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,400
or the physical event that I'm describing, the rocket launch, the tennis ball being thrown,

47
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,400
the airplane taking off, the car driving forward, or the economics model, or the statistical

48
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,760
distribution, right? It describes the distribution of weight, height and IQ in the general population.

49
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,880
So there's unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics, just think about this and Langen says this,

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:09,360
if there is a separation between the language and the event, then the language cannot communicate

51
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,360
what's happening in the event. So because the chicken scratches can perfectly communicate,

52
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,320
they're isomorphic to the event and they perfectly describe, communicate in my mind what's happening

53
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,800
in the event. So that's isomorphism, keep that in mind, that's point one, point two,

54
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,600
a little bit more difficult. Langen extends or distributes formal logic over the dualisms,

55
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,400
mind, matter, subject, object, observer, universe, that is, language bridges these dualisms as it

56
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,160
distributes over them with the ultimate microscale being classical logic, true,

57
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,840
verse, false, or bit information. So there's, with RenÃ© Descartes, there was the major

58
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,600
preeminent explication of dualism, the mind, matter, dualism, but the problem that science

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
and philosophy have been running into since Descartes made this mind, matter, distinction

60
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,800
is that how do mind and matter touch and interact and move and affect each other?

61
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,320
If they're separated, if they're distinguished, if they're separate, if they're different

62
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,480
substance, how do mind and matter touch? What Langen does is he takes these dualisms

63
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,640
and he says that actually my language extends over the dualism. So if you have the separation,

64
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,600
the language bridges the gap, extends over the dualism and the language that he's using is called

65
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,960
the metaformal language or metaformal system and there's an extension of classical logic

66
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,760
and it's ultimate building blocks, the ultimate microscale, this language is true, verse, false.

67
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,560
So even in spoken English languages, the ultimate logic is true, verse, false, this wall is standing

68
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,520
or it's not standing, true, false, it's standing or not standing, the lamp is on or not on,

69
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,640
the chair is working or not working, the door works or it doesn't work, the water is on or it's

70
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:59,520
not on. All language, most languages can be reduced as formal logic and Langen takes this

71
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,880
formal logic, extends it, calls it the metaformal system, metaformal language, and extends it over

72
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,400
the dualisms. How does this work? How does it, how does it, how does that work? How does it

73
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,360
distribute over? How does it bridge the gap? Well if you take mind and matter, let's say mind and

74
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:25,120
matter are X and Y. X and Y are differentiated, yes. X and Y, X and Y are differentiated, yes,

75
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:32,160
but they're on the same medium. It's called syndifionesis, syndifionesis. I think I'm

76
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,800
pronouncing that right. The fact that they're synchronized, they're synchronized on the same

77
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
medium. There's differences, yes, they're differentiated, yes, but they're synchronized.

78
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,520
So if mind and matter, mind and matter, even though they can't call them separate, they're

79
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,520
actually not separate, they're actually on the same reality plane. They're both part of reality,

80
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,200
they're both on the physical plane of strong weak forces, gravitational pull, space time,

81
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,520
fabric of space time. Mind and matter on the same reality plane that they are,

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,840
even though they're differentiated, formal logic distributes over this medium. So if mind and

83
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,160
matter are part of the same medium, or subject and object, or observer and universe are part

84
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,200
of the same reality plane, then the language can distribute over that medium. That plane is the

85
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,680
medium. Let me just phrase this right. Mind and matter, subject, object, observer, universe

86
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:28,080
are like X and Y and syn-difionesis, they're on the same medium. This medium is reality,

87
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,160
reality is the medium, and the language distributes over this medium, and thus bridges the gap between

88
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:40,000
the dualisms. That's the easiest way that I can state it. And remember, it comports the

89
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,600
classical logic, but that way the metaphorical system language that Chris Lange uses in CTME

90
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,280
distributes over the medium that is reality, and reality covers the dualism. Reality,

91
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,840
mind and matter, subject, object, or observer, universe are part of the same reality plane,

92
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,120
the same reality medium, and the formal logic of language distributes over that medium. And that's

93
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,520
how Lange and his language bridges the gap of dualism and eliminates the dualism entirely.

94
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:14,400
Point three, and this will be even more complex to explain. It's like a marathon,

95
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,760
let's see if I can do it. All in one take, by the way.

96
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,640
Three, there is a coupling of objects and syntactic operators, humans with the universe in multiplex

97
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,040
unity, and the whole G-Principle. Remember the syn-difionesis, X, Y. So with syn-difionesis,

98
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,520
as I used in the second point, X and Y are in the same, they're differentiated, but they're on the

99
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,240
same medium, so they're synchronicity with a difference. They're in the same medium, and because

100
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,800
the metaphorical system of logic can extend over that medium, it can bridge the gap between

101
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,040
the dualisms. Point three is that we know how they're on the same medium, we know how the medium

102
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,320
contains the objects, the objects X and Y, but how do the objects X and Y contain the medium?

103
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,600
So we know that we all exist in the universe, the universe contains us, but how do we contain the

104
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,840
universe? And this gets down to the multiplex unity. So you as, whether it be an object to rock,

105
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,240
or more importantly, you as a syntactic operator, remember, there's a primary syntactic operator

106
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,480
in the language theory, which is God, there's secondary syntactic operators, which are humans,

107
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,680
and there's tertiary, which may be animals or rocks or objects. So as the secondary, I'll just

108
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,640
call them syntactic operators, as they're called, there is multiplex unity, and multiplex unity

109
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:36,480
means that there's an intersect between reality and the syntactic operator, and multiplex unity

110
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:44,320
describes how there's an internal boundary to the syntactic operator that had that there's a

111
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,720
boundary of a boundary, there's a circle, so it's like the subject, you're a circle, you're the subject,

112
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,960
and you have an internal boundary that contains your that contains your syntax and your descriptive

113
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,640
internal consistency. And then there's the outside of the there's the outside of you in the universe.

114
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,280
And how does this, how do you contain the universe? Think of it as you are part of the

115
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,560
universe, you're part of the medium, the strongly force of strongly force of physics of gravity,

116
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,800
all the fields of physics operate through your electromagnetism operate through you all the time.

117
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,400
You'll have an internal boundary, yes, there's a boundary around your subjectivity, but your

118
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,600
subjectivity enters unisex, he calls it unisex with the universe through information and syntax

119
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,560
and state. If the universe is topological, which means it's a state of objects and things and

120
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,120
places of things and a landscape, then you are intersecting with this on a mult on a unisex,

121
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,160
and it's called multiplex unity. And this takes into account the whole of your principle, so just

122
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,080
like in Halo, how Cortana as she's called is a holograph that comes out, it's a three-dimensional

123
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:59,680
physical thing. Your body and your mind are a holograph that come into the physical universe.

124
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:10,480
How do you describe this? So, you unisex with reality, the hologee means that you're projected

125
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,240
out into space, right? Hologee. The universe, like Cindy Fionnis says, is the universe contains you,

126
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,840
but you also contain the universe, you have an internal boundary that's multiplex unity,

127
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:28,720
unisex with the universe. And a hologee is the fact that you come up in the space, essentially.

128
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:38,400
You occupy space. You're holographic to yourself as a syntactic operator. And this hologee,

129
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,760
this hologee is how you interact with, this is how you come into space, and this is how you

130
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,960
interact with the outside world. So, the outside world comports the syntax and information and

131
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,840
it's topological. Multiplex unity means that you unisex with this universe, and hologee means

132
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:06,320
that you're out into a occupied space, and your hologee is like you contain the information and

133
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,840
self of your internal syntax in general states, and you contain it within yourself, but then,

134
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:16,800
you output into the world, and the world inputs into you. That's the best way, I think, I can

135
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:22,160
describe it. I may have garbled it a bit, but there's... think of it as there's a coupling

136
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,440
with multiplex unity and haulogy there's a coupling of you as a syntactic operator or object

137
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,960
with the universe you're coupled with the universe and it's like this and it's how it's how you

138
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,400
contain the universe as well as the universe contains you you're coupled with the universe

139
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,880
you're coupled with the universe there's a unisex and the haulogy means you you come out and you

140
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,920
output as well as input and you have an internal boundary

141
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,240
and it's just as a mathematical way of describing how you

142
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,440
couple with the universe that's the simplest way I can describe it so let me reiterate the summary

143
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,000
first there's unreasonable funness of mathematics how do chicken scratches become a rocket launch

144
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,680
but they have isomorphism between them which means the properties are attributes and points of the

145
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,440
language that you write down once your chicken scratches can comport to the

146
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,920
way the rocket takes off or the airplane takes off or the economy works point two

147
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,320
point two the distribution of formal logic over the dualism so these dualisms even though

148
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,920
that even though there's mind matter subject object of very universe you have it so that

149
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,240
the dualism they're on the same medium which is reality and because it's the same medium logic

150
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,840
distributes over it as a language the language really language distributes over the dualisms

151
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,880
counters what science has held for close to 400 years and finally there's a coupling of objects

152
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,800
or you as a syntactic operator with the universe there's a unisex between you you have an internal

153
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,520
boundary and the holograph means that you occupy space or you output or you output language and

154
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,800
you input language so these are the three points this is a big breakthrough so you can remember

155
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:05,120
the breakthrough is that reality is a language it's isomorphic it distributes over dualisms

156
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,160
and it couples yourself with your universe remember to repeat that reality is language

157
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,040
language is reality it's isomorphic with reality it distributes over reality and it couples

158
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,080
yourself as a syntactic operator with the universe this is the big breakthrough the ctmu

159
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:28,400
if and only confusion i confuse you i'm sorry uh i'm trying to come to better terms of that

160
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:32,080
myself and i'm trying to come to better terms that by explaining it i'll be putting out future

161
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:37,680
videos like one an italic principle and one on state versus syntax as building blocks of the ctmu

162
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,920
and finally have a secret project in the works that i got to read the ctmu a couple times over

163
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:46,560
but a secret project in the works that i think it's going to be big on the ctmu it'll long

164
00:15:46,560 --> 00:16:03,040
overdue series on the ctmu so until next time take care bye-bye

165
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,440
you
