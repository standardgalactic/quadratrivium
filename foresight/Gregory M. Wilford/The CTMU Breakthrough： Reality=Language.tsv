0	20960	Hello and welcome. Today I will be extending my coverage of the CTMU a long overdue video
20960	27120	on what is the real breakthrough of the CTMU in terms of metaphysics, in terms of science,
27120	32360	in terms of philosophy, in terms of all fields of science and reality theory. The big breakthrough
32360	40240	of the CTMU, the title of the tazer, will be the CTMU breakthrough. Reality is a language.
40240	45960	The thesis is that the CTMU is a living model of reality, a model which is the same as reality
45960	50720	itself, which provides a breakthrough for all fields of science and philosophy as well
50720	59280	as theology, being a super tautology of all of reality itself. The key insight, the key insight
59280	67800	is that reality is a language and language is a reality. Reality is a language and language is
67800	74320	reality. This insight has three main components that I think are critical to it, and there's many
74320	79200	more things in the CTMU itself to describe this, but I break it down into three components. The
79200	84240	first one is isomorphism, I will describe each of these below, but the first point is isomorphism,
84800	90960	I'll describe this below. Second, distribution of logic over dualisms, distribution of language or
90960	95920	logic over dualisms, and three, the coupling of objects with universe or multiplex unity,
95920	103920	Hologi. Before I get bogged down into the details, I like to say that this is very difficult. It's
103920	107840	very, if you understand these three components though, then you understand the key breakthrough
107840	112800	to the CTMU, and to simplify it, and if you want to press your friends by saying it, just say,
112800	117600	the CTMU holds that reality is a language and language is a reality. But the first point,
117600	123040	isomorphism. So Langen gets into a saying called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics,
124880	131760	the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. So how is the mathematics can describe the way a
131760	136240	rocket launches, or can describe the way the economy functions, or the way the tide comes in
136480	142000	physics, or the way that a bicycle accelerates, or a car accelerates, or a runner, or a football,
142000	147520	or a tennis ball. How does mathematics describe all these physical events so well? How does it,
147520	154080	if it were, if it were decoupled from these events, then it would have no way of communicating the
154080	161520	ideas into your mind. And then what the phrase I like to say is, how is there isomorphism between
161600	165680	chicken, and I'll describe it with isomorphism. But how is there isomorphism between chicken
165680	170000	scratches writing, chicken scratch writing, like my handwriting looks like chicken scratches,
170000	175200	it's very messy. How is there isomorphism between chicken scratch writing and rocket launches?
175200	180480	So if I'm a physicist writing out a formula, how do I, how do my chicken, the squeal lines I make
180480	185280	on a piece of paper, how do they comport to the rocket launch? How do they communicate to me
185280	188880	what's happening in the rocket launch, or what's happening in my local grocery store with the,
189440	198000	with an economic function, or spline man curve? How does it work so well? We know that they are
198000	202160	more than just chicken scratches, they are more than just gibberish, they are a language, a
202160	208320	functioning language. So this language that you write out is isomorphic to the physical events
208320	212880	that surrounds you, and it communicates these events to you. What is isomorphism, isomorphism
213360	222320	I mean, I might prescribe a diagram perhaps here of what isomorphism is, I S O M O R P H I S M isomorphism.
223600	228960	So it has a block, so you have a block and a pyramid, the points at these aren't these aren't
228960	232960	language term, these aren't language terms, but I'll just use them here, the points attributes
232960	238160	and properties of the block correspond verbatim to the points attributes and properties of the
238160	243680	pyramid. So it's using mathematics, if you have a block and a pyramid, the points attributes and
243680	249680	properties of the block comport or translate verbatim to the points attributes and properties of the
251120	256160	pyramid, that's isomorphism. So as it comes to language, excuse me,
259520	264400	as it comes to language, how do these square lines, this language that I'm writing out,
264400	268560	this formula, this equation that I'm writing out for economics or rocket launches or acceleration
268560	274080	of cars or planes, airplanes or bicycles or tennis balls or soccer balls, this language that
274080	280800	I'm writing out with my chicken scratches isomorphically verbatim describes the rocket launch
280800	284400	or the physical event that I'm describing, the rocket launch, the tennis ball being thrown,
285360	290400	the airplane taking off, the car driving forward, or the economics model, or the statistical
290480	295760	distribution, right? It describes the distribution of weight, height and IQ in the general population.
297120	300880	So there's unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics, just think about this and Langen says this,
301440	309360	if there is a separation between the language and the event, then the language cannot communicate
309360	315360	what's happening in the event. So because the chicken scratches can perfectly communicate,
315360	320320	they're isomorphic to the event and they perfectly describe, communicate in my mind what's happening
320400	324800	in the event. So that's isomorphism, keep that in mind, that's point one, point two,
324800	331600	a little bit more difficult. Langen extends or distributes formal logic over the dualisms,
331600	338400	mind, matter, subject, object, observer, universe, that is, language bridges these dualisms as it
338400	342160	distributes over them with the ultimate microscale being classical logic, true,
342160	349840	verse, false, or bit information. So there's, with Ren√© Descartes, there was the major
350400	357600	preeminent explication of dualism, the mind, matter, dualism, but the problem that science
357600	360960	and philosophy have been running into since Descartes made this mind, matter, distinction
362240	366800	is that how do mind and matter touch and interact and move and affect each other?
366800	370320	If they're separated, if they're distinguished, if they're separate, if they're different
370400	376480	substance, how do mind and matter touch? What Langen does is he takes these dualisms
377280	382640	and he says that actually my language extends over the dualism. So if you have the separation,
382640	387600	the language bridges the gap, extends over the dualism and the language that he's using is called
387600	392960	the metaformal language or metaformal system and there's an extension of classical logic
392960	397760	and it's ultimate building blocks, the ultimate microscale, this language is true, verse, false.
397760	402560	So even in spoken English languages, the ultimate logic is true, verse, false, this wall is standing
402560	407520	or it's not standing, true, false, it's standing or not standing, the lamp is on or not on,
407520	412640	the chair is working or not working, the door works or it doesn't work, the water is on or it's
412640	419520	not on. All language, most languages can be reduced as formal logic and Langen takes this
419520	424880	formal logic, extends it, calls it the metaformal system, metaformal language, and extends it over
424880	430400	the dualisms. How does this work? How does it, how does it, how does that work? How does it
430400	435360	distribute over? How does it bridge the gap? Well if you take mind and matter, let's say mind and
435360	445120	matter are X and Y. X and Y are differentiated, yes. X and Y, X and Y are differentiated, yes,
445120	452160	but they're on the same medium. It's called syndifionesis, syndifionesis. I think I'm
452160	456800	pronouncing that right. The fact that they're synchronized, they're synchronized on the same
456800	460800	medium. There's differences, yes, they're differentiated, yes, but they're synchronized.
460800	465520	So if mind and matter, mind and matter, even though they can't call them separate, they're
465520	469520	actually not separate, they're actually on the same reality plane. They're both part of reality,
469520	473200	they're both on the physical plane of strong weak forces, gravitational pull, space time,
473200	477520	fabric of space time. Mind and matter on the same reality plane that they are,
478000	485840	even though they're differentiated, formal logic distributes over this medium. So if mind and
485840	490160	matter are part of the same medium, or subject and object, or observer and universe are part
490160	495200	of the same reality plane, then the language can distribute over that medium. That plane is the
495200	501680	medium. Let me just phrase this right. Mind and matter, subject, object, observer, universe
502320	508080	are like X and Y and syn-difionesis, they're on the same medium. This medium is reality,
508080	514160	reality is the medium, and the language distributes over this medium, and thus bridges the gap between
514160	520000	the dualisms. That's the easiest way that I can state it. And remember, it comports the
520000	525600	classical logic, but that way the metaphorical system language that Chris Lange uses in CTME
525600	531280	distributes over the medium that is reality, and reality covers the dualism. Reality,
532160	535840	mind and matter, subject, object, or observer, universe are part of the same reality plane,
535840	541120	the same reality medium, and the formal logic of language distributes over that medium. And that's
541120	547520	how Lange and his language bridges the gap of dualism and eliminates the dualism entirely.
548080	554400	Point three, and this will be even more complex to explain. It's like a marathon,
554400	557760	let's see if I can do it. All in one take, by the way.
560000	566640	Three, there is a coupling of objects and syntactic operators, humans with the universe in multiplex
566640	573040	unity, and the whole G-Principle. Remember the syn-difionesis, X, Y. So with syn-difionesis,
573040	577520	as I used in the second point, X and Y are in the same, they're differentiated, but they're on the
577520	582240	same medium, so they're synchronicity with a difference. They're in the same medium, and because
582720	586800	the metaphorical system of logic can extend over that medium, it can bridge the gap between
586800	593040	the dualisms. Point three is that we know how they're on the same medium, we know how the medium
593040	598320	contains the objects, the objects X and Y, but how do the objects X and Y contain the medium?
599040	603600	So we know that we all exist in the universe, the universe contains us, but how do we contain the
603600	609840	universe? And this gets down to the multiplex unity. So you as, whether it be an object to rock,
609840	614240	or more importantly, you as a syntactic operator, remember, there's a primary syntactic operator
614240	618480	in the language theory, which is God, there's secondary syntactic operators, which are humans,
618480	623680	and there's tertiary, which may be animals or rocks or objects. So as the secondary, I'll just
623680	628640	call them syntactic operators, as they're called, there is multiplex unity, and multiplex unity
628640	636480	means that there's an intersect between reality and the syntactic operator, and multiplex unity
636480	644320	describes how there's an internal boundary to the syntactic operator that had that there's a
644320	650720	boundary of a boundary, there's a circle, so it's like the subject, you're a circle, you're the subject,
650720	654960	and you have an internal boundary that contains your that contains your syntax and your descriptive
654960	660640	internal consistency. And then there's the outside of the there's the outside of you in the universe.
660640	665280	And how does this, how do you contain the universe? Think of it as you are part of the
665280	670560	universe, you're part of the medium, the strongly force of strongly force of physics of gravity,
670560	674800	all the fields of physics operate through your electromagnetism operate through you all the time.
675920	680400	You'll have an internal boundary, yes, there's a boundary around your subjectivity, but your
680400	687600	subjectivity enters unisex, he calls it unisex with the universe through information and syntax
688320	694560	and state. If the universe is topological, which means it's a state of objects and things and
694560	701120	places of things and a landscape, then you are intersecting with this on a mult on a unisex,
701120	706160	and it's called multiplex unity. And this takes into account the whole of your principle, so just
706160	712080	like in Halo, how Cortana as she's called is a holograph that comes out, it's a three-dimensional
712080	719680	physical thing. Your body and your mind are a holograph that come into the physical universe.
720240	730480	How do you describe this? So, you unisex with reality, the hologee means that you're projected
730480	738240	out into space, right? Hologee. The universe, like Cindy Fionnis says, is the universe contains you,
738240	741840	but you also contain the universe, you have an internal boundary that's multiplex unity,
741840	748720	unisex with the universe. And a hologee is the fact that you come up in the space, essentially.
749440	758400	You occupy space. You're holographic to yourself as a syntactic operator. And this hologee,
760560	765760	this hologee is how you interact with, this is how you come into space, and this is how you
765760	770960	interact with the outside world. So, the outside world comports the syntax and information and
770960	775840	it's topological. Multiplex unity means that you unisex with this universe, and hologee means
775920	786320	that you're out into a occupied space, and your hologee is like you contain the information and
786320	791840	self of your internal syntax in general states, and you contain it within yourself, but then,
791840	796800	you output into the world, and the world inputs into you. That's the best way, I think, I can
796800	802160	describe it. I may have garbled it a bit, but there's... think of it as there's a coupling
802160	807440	with multiplex unity and haulogy there's a coupling of you as a syntactic operator or object
807440	812960	with the universe you're coupled with the universe and it's like this and it's how it's how you
812960	816400	contain the universe as well as the universe contains you you're coupled with the universe
818720	822880	you're coupled with the universe there's a unisex and the haulogy means you you come out and you
823440	825920	output as well as input and you have an internal boundary
826480	830240	and it's just as a mathematical way of describing how you
832160	837440	couple with the universe that's the simplest way I can describe it so let me reiterate the summary
837440	842000	first there's unreasonable funness of mathematics how do chicken scratches become a rocket launch
842000	845680	but they have isomorphism between them which means the properties are attributes and points of the
846240	849440	language that you write down once your chicken scratches can comport to the
849440	853920	way the rocket takes off or the airplane takes off or the economy works point two
854240	860320	point two the distribution of formal logic over the dualism so these dualisms even though
860320	865920	that even though there's mind matter subject object of very universe you have it so that
867840	872240	the dualism they're on the same medium which is reality and because it's the same medium logic
872240	877840	distributes over it as a language the language really language distributes over the dualisms
878800	884880	counters what science has held for close to 400 years and finally there's a coupling of objects
884880	888800	or you as a syntactic operator with the universe there's a unisex between you you have an internal
888800	893520	boundary and the holograph means that you occupy space or you output or you output language and
893520	898800	you input language so these are the three points this is a big breakthrough so you can remember
898800	905120	the breakthrough is that reality is a language it's isomorphic it distributes over dualisms
905200	910160	and it couples yourself with your universe remember to repeat that reality is language
910160	917040	language is reality it's isomorphic with reality it distributes over reality and it couples
917040	922080	yourself as a syntactic operator with the universe this is the big breakthrough the ctmu
922080	928400	if and only confusion i confuse you i'm sorry uh i'm trying to come to better terms of that
928400	932080	myself and i'm trying to come to better terms that by explaining it i'll be putting out future
932080	937680	videos like one an italic principle and one on state versus syntax as building blocks of the ctmu
937680	941920	and finally have a secret project in the works that i got to read the ctmu a couple times over
941920	946560	but a secret project in the works that i think it's going to be big on the ctmu it'll long
946560	963040	overdue series on the ctmu so until next time take care bye-bye
976560	977440	you
