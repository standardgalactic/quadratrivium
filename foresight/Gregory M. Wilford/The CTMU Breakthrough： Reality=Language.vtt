00:00.000 --> 00:20.960
Hello and welcome. Today I will be extending my coverage of the CTMU a long overdue video

00:20.960 --> 00:27.120
on what is the real breakthrough of the CTMU in terms of metaphysics, in terms of science,

00:27.120 --> 00:32.360
in terms of philosophy, in terms of all fields of science and reality theory. The big breakthrough

00:32.360 --> 00:40.240
of the CTMU, the title of the tazer, will be the CTMU breakthrough. Reality is a language.

00:40.240 --> 00:45.960
The thesis is that the CTMU is a living model of reality, a model which is the same as reality

00:45.960 --> 00:50.720
itself, which provides a breakthrough for all fields of science and philosophy as well

00:50.720 --> 00:59.280
as theology, being a super tautology of all of reality itself. The key insight, the key insight

00:59.280 --> 01:07.800
is that reality is a language and language is a reality. Reality is a language and language is

01:07.800 --> 01:14.320
reality. This insight has three main components that I think are critical to it, and there's many

01:14.320 --> 01:19.200
more things in the CTMU itself to describe this, but I break it down into three components. The

01:19.200 --> 01:24.240
first one is isomorphism, I will describe each of these below, but the first point is isomorphism,

01:24.800 --> 01:30.960
I'll describe this below. Second, distribution of logic over dualisms, distribution of language or

01:30.960 --> 01:35.920
logic over dualisms, and three, the coupling of objects with universe or multiplex unity,

01:35.920 --> 01:43.920
Hologi. Before I get bogged down into the details, I like to say that this is very difficult. It's

01:43.920 --> 01:47.840
very, if you understand these three components though, then you understand the key breakthrough

01:47.840 --> 01:52.800
to the CTMU, and to simplify it, and if you want to press your friends by saying it, just say,

01:52.800 --> 01:57.600
the CTMU holds that reality is a language and language is a reality. But the first point,

01:57.600 --> 02:03.040
isomorphism. So Langen gets into a saying called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics,

02:04.880 --> 02:11.760
the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics. So how is the mathematics can describe the way a

02:11.760 --> 02:16.240
rocket launches, or can describe the way the economy functions, or the way the tide comes in

02:16.480 --> 02:22.000
physics, or the way that a bicycle accelerates, or a car accelerates, or a runner, or a football,

02:22.000 --> 02:27.520
or a tennis ball. How does mathematics describe all these physical events so well? How does it,

02:27.520 --> 02:34.080
if it were, if it were decoupled from these events, then it would have no way of communicating the

02:34.080 --> 02:41.520
ideas into your mind. And then what the phrase I like to say is, how is there isomorphism between

02:41.600 --> 02:45.680
chicken, and I'll describe it with isomorphism. But how is there isomorphism between chicken

02:45.680 --> 02:50.000
scratches writing, chicken scratch writing, like my handwriting looks like chicken scratches,

02:50.000 --> 02:55.200
it's very messy. How is there isomorphism between chicken scratch writing and rocket launches?

02:55.200 --> 03:00.480
So if I'm a physicist writing out a formula, how do I, how do my chicken, the squeal lines I make

03:00.480 --> 03:05.280
on a piece of paper, how do they comport to the rocket launch? How do they communicate to me

03:05.280 --> 03:08.880
what's happening in the rocket launch, or what's happening in my local grocery store with the,

03:09.440 --> 03:18.000
with an economic function, or spline man curve? How does it work so well? We know that they are

03:18.000 --> 03:22.160
more than just chicken scratches, they are more than just gibberish, they are a language, a

03:22.160 --> 03:28.320
functioning language. So this language that you write out is isomorphic to the physical events

03:28.320 --> 03:32.880
that surrounds you, and it communicates these events to you. What is isomorphism, isomorphism

03:33.360 --> 03:42.320
I mean, I might prescribe a diagram perhaps here of what isomorphism is, I S O M O R P H I S M isomorphism.

03:43.600 --> 03:48.960
So it has a block, so you have a block and a pyramid, the points at these aren't these aren't

03:48.960 --> 03:52.960
language term, these aren't language terms, but I'll just use them here, the points attributes

03:52.960 --> 03:58.160
and properties of the block correspond verbatim to the points attributes and properties of the

03:58.160 --> 04:03.680
pyramid. So it's using mathematics, if you have a block and a pyramid, the points attributes and

04:03.680 --> 04:09.680
properties of the block comport or translate verbatim to the points attributes and properties of the

04:11.120 --> 04:16.160
pyramid, that's isomorphism. So as it comes to language, excuse me,

04:19.520 --> 04:24.400
as it comes to language, how do these square lines, this language that I'm writing out,

04:24.400 --> 04:28.560
this formula, this equation that I'm writing out for economics or rocket launches or acceleration

04:28.560 --> 04:34.080
of cars or planes, airplanes or bicycles or tennis balls or soccer balls, this language that

04:34.080 --> 04:40.800
I'm writing out with my chicken scratches isomorphically verbatim describes the rocket launch

04:40.800 --> 04:44.400
or the physical event that I'm describing, the rocket launch, the tennis ball being thrown,

04:45.360 --> 04:50.400
the airplane taking off, the car driving forward, or the economics model, or the statistical

04:50.480 --> 04:55.760
distribution, right? It describes the distribution of weight, height and IQ in the general population.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.880
So there's unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics, just think about this and Langen says this,

05:01.440 --> 05:09.360
if there is a separation between the language and the event, then the language cannot communicate

05:09.360 --> 05:15.360
what's happening in the event. So because the chicken scratches can perfectly communicate,

05:15.360 --> 05:20.320
they're isomorphic to the event and they perfectly describe, communicate in my mind what's happening

05:20.400 --> 05:24.800
in the event. So that's isomorphism, keep that in mind, that's point one, point two,

05:24.800 --> 05:31.600
a little bit more difficult. Langen extends or distributes formal logic over the dualisms,

05:31.600 --> 05:38.400
mind, matter, subject, object, observer, universe, that is, language bridges these dualisms as it

05:38.400 --> 05:42.160
distributes over them with the ultimate microscale being classical logic, true,

05:42.160 --> 05:49.840
verse, false, or bit information. So there's, with RenÃ© Descartes, there was the major

05:50.400 --> 05:57.600
preeminent explication of dualism, the mind, matter, dualism, but the problem that science

05:57.600 --> 06:00.960
and philosophy have been running into since Descartes made this mind, matter, distinction

06:02.240 --> 06:06.800
is that how do mind and matter touch and interact and move and affect each other?

06:06.800 --> 06:10.320
If they're separated, if they're distinguished, if they're separate, if they're different

06:10.400 --> 06:16.480
substance, how do mind and matter touch? What Langen does is he takes these dualisms

06:17.280 --> 06:22.640
and he says that actually my language extends over the dualism. So if you have the separation,

06:22.640 --> 06:27.600
the language bridges the gap, extends over the dualism and the language that he's using is called

06:27.600 --> 06:32.960
the metaformal language or metaformal system and there's an extension of classical logic

06:32.960 --> 06:37.760
and it's ultimate building blocks, the ultimate microscale, this language is true, verse, false.

06:37.760 --> 06:42.560
So even in spoken English languages, the ultimate logic is true, verse, false, this wall is standing

06:42.560 --> 06:47.520
or it's not standing, true, false, it's standing or not standing, the lamp is on or not on,

06:47.520 --> 06:52.640
the chair is working or not working, the door works or it doesn't work, the water is on or it's

06:52.640 --> 06:59.520
not on. All language, most languages can be reduced as formal logic and Langen takes this

06:59.520 --> 07:04.880
formal logic, extends it, calls it the metaformal system, metaformal language, and extends it over

07:04.880 --> 07:10.400
the dualisms. How does this work? How does it, how does it, how does that work? How does it

07:10.400 --> 07:15.360
distribute over? How does it bridge the gap? Well if you take mind and matter, let's say mind and

07:15.360 --> 07:25.120
matter are X and Y. X and Y are differentiated, yes. X and Y, X and Y are differentiated, yes,

07:25.120 --> 07:32.160
but they're on the same medium. It's called syndifionesis, syndifionesis. I think I'm

07:32.160 --> 07:36.800
pronouncing that right. The fact that they're synchronized, they're synchronized on the same

07:36.800 --> 07:40.800
medium. There's differences, yes, they're differentiated, yes, but they're synchronized.

07:40.800 --> 07:45.520
So if mind and matter, mind and matter, even though they can't call them separate, they're

07:45.520 --> 07:49.520
actually not separate, they're actually on the same reality plane. They're both part of reality,

07:49.520 --> 07:53.200
they're both on the physical plane of strong weak forces, gravitational pull, space time,

07:53.200 --> 07:57.520
fabric of space time. Mind and matter on the same reality plane that they are,

07:58.000 --> 08:05.840
even though they're differentiated, formal logic distributes over this medium. So if mind and

08:05.840 --> 08:10.160
matter are part of the same medium, or subject and object, or observer and universe are part

08:10.160 --> 08:15.200
of the same reality plane, then the language can distribute over that medium. That plane is the

08:15.200 --> 08:21.680
medium. Let me just phrase this right. Mind and matter, subject, object, observer, universe

08:22.320 --> 08:28.080
are like X and Y and syn-difionesis, they're on the same medium. This medium is reality,

08:28.080 --> 08:34.160
reality is the medium, and the language distributes over this medium, and thus bridges the gap between

08:34.160 --> 08:40.000
the dualisms. That's the easiest way that I can state it. And remember, it comports the

08:40.000 --> 08:45.600
classical logic, but that way the metaphorical system language that Chris Lange uses in CTME

08:45.600 --> 08:51.280
distributes over the medium that is reality, and reality covers the dualism. Reality,

08:52.160 --> 08:55.840
mind and matter, subject, object, or observer, universe are part of the same reality plane,

08:55.840 --> 09:01.120
the same reality medium, and the formal logic of language distributes over that medium. And that's

09:01.120 --> 09:07.520
how Lange and his language bridges the gap of dualism and eliminates the dualism entirely.

09:08.080 --> 09:14.400
Point three, and this will be even more complex to explain. It's like a marathon,

09:14.400 --> 09:17.760
let's see if I can do it. All in one take, by the way.

09:20.000 --> 09:26.640
Three, there is a coupling of objects and syntactic operators, humans with the universe in multiplex

09:26.640 --> 09:33.040
unity, and the whole G-Principle. Remember the syn-difionesis, X, Y. So with syn-difionesis,

09:33.040 --> 09:37.520
as I used in the second point, X and Y are in the same, they're differentiated, but they're on the

09:37.520 --> 09:42.240
same medium, so they're synchronicity with a difference. They're in the same medium, and because

09:42.720 --> 09:46.800
the metaphorical system of logic can extend over that medium, it can bridge the gap between

09:46.800 --> 09:53.040
the dualisms. Point three is that we know how they're on the same medium, we know how the medium

09:53.040 --> 09:58.320
contains the objects, the objects X and Y, but how do the objects X and Y contain the medium?

09:59.040 --> 10:03.600
So we know that we all exist in the universe, the universe contains us, but how do we contain the

10:03.600 --> 10:09.840
universe? And this gets down to the multiplex unity. So you as, whether it be an object to rock,

10:09.840 --> 10:14.240
or more importantly, you as a syntactic operator, remember, there's a primary syntactic operator

10:14.240 --> 10:18.480
in the language theory, which is God, there's secondary syntactic operators, which are humans,

10:18.480 --> 10:23.680
and there's tertiary, which may be animals or rocks or objects. So as the secondary, I'll just

10:23.680 --> 10:28.640
call them syntactic operators, as they're called, there is multiplex unity, and multiplex unity

10:28.640 --> 10:36.480
means that there's an intersect between reality and the syntactic operator, and multiplex unity

10:36.480 --> 10:44.320
describes how there's an internal boundary to the syntactic operator that had that there's a

10:44.320 --> 10:50.720
boundary of a boundary, there's a circle, so it's like the subject, you're a circle, you're the subject,

10:50.720 --> 10:54.960
and you have an internal boundary that contains your that contains your syntax and your descriptive

10:54.960 --> 11:00.640
internal consistency. And then there's the outside of the there's the outside of you in the universe.

11:00.640 --> 11:05.280
And how does this, how do you contain the universe? Think of it as you are part of the

11:05.280 --> 11:10.560
universe, you're part of the medium, the strongly force of strongly force of physics of gravity,

11:10.560 --> 11:14.800
all the fields of physics operate through your electromagnetism operate through you all the time.

11:15.920 --> 11:20.400
You'll have an internal boundary, yes, there's a boundary around your subjectivity, but your

11:20.400 --> 11:27.600
subjectivity enters unisex, he calls it unisex with the universe through information and syntax

11:28.320 --> 11:34.560
and state. If the universe is topological, which means it's a state of objects and things and

11:34.560 --> 11:41.120
places of things and a landscape, then you are intersecting with this on a mult on a unisex,

11:41.120 --> 11:46.160
and it's called multiplex unity. And this takes into account the whole of your principle, so just

11:46.160 --> 11:52.080
like in Halo, how Cortana as she's called is a holograph that comes out, it's a three-dimensional

11:52.080 --> 11:59.680
physical thing. Your body and your mind are a holograph that come into the physical universe.

12:00.240 --> 12:10.480
How do you describe this? So, you unisex with reality, the hologee means that you're projected

12:10.480 --> 12:18.240
out into space, right? Hologee. The universe, like Cindy Fionnis says, is the universe contains you,

12:18.240 --> 12:21.840
but you also contain the universe, you have an internal boundary that's multiplex unity,

12:21.840 --> 12:28.720
unisex with the universe. And a hologee is the fact that you come up in the space, essentially.

12:29.440 --> 12:38.400
You occupy space. You're holographic to yourself as a syntactic operator. And this hologee,

12:40.560 --> 12:45.760
this hologee is how you interact with, this is how you come into space, and this is how you

12:45.760 --> 12:50.960
interact with the outside world. So, the outside world comports the syntax and information and

12:50.960 --> 12:55.840
it's topological. Multiplex unity means that you unisex with this universe, and hologee means

12:55.920 --> 13:06.320
that you're out into a occupied space, and your hologee is like you contain the information and

13:06.320 --> 13:11.840
self of your internal syntax in general states, and you contain it within yourself, but then,

13:11.840 --> 13:16.800
you output into the world, and the world inputs into you. That's the best way, I think, I can

13:16.800 --> 13:22.160
describe it. I may have garbled it a bit, but there's... think of it as there's a coupling

13:22.160 --> 13:27.440
with multiplex unity and haulogy there's a coupling of you as a syntactic operator or object

13:27.440 --> 13:32.960
with the universe you're coupled with the universe and it's like this and it's how it's how you

13:32.960 --> 13:36.400
contain the universe as well as the universe contains you you're coupled with the universe

13:38.720 --> 13:42.880
you're coupled with the universe there's a unisex and the haulogy means you you come out and you

13:43.440 --> 13:45.920
output as well as input and you have an internal boundary

13:46.480 --> 13:50.240
and it's just as a mathematical way of describing how you

13:52.160 --> 13:57.440
couple with the universe that's the simplest way I can describe it so let me reiterate the summary

13:57.440 --> 14:02.000
first there's unreasonable funness of mathematics how do chicken scratches become a rocket launch

14:02.000 --> 14:05.680
but they have isomorphism between them which means the properties are attributes and points of the

14:06.240 --> 14:09.440
language that you write down once your chicken scratches can comport to the

14:09.440 --> 14:13.920
way the rocket takes off or the airplane takes off or the economy works point two

14:14.240 --> 14:20.320
point two the distribution of formal logic over the dualism so these dualisms even though

14:20.320 --> 14:25.920
that even though there's mind matter subject object of very universe you have it so that

14:27.840 --> 14:32.240
the dualism they're on the same medium which is reality and because it's the same medium logic

14:32.240 --> 14:37.840
distributes over it as a language the language really language distributes over the dualisms

14:38.800 --> 14:44.880
counters what science has held for close to 400 years and finally there's a coupling of objects

14:44.880 --> 14:48.800
or you as a syntactic operator with the universe there's a unisex between you you have an internal

14:48.800 --> 14:53.520
boundary and the holograph means that you occupy space or you output or you output language and

14:53.520 --> 14:58.800
you input language so these are the three points this is a big breakthrough so you can remember

14:58.800 --> 15:05.120
the breakthrough is that reality is a language it's isomorphic it distributes over dualisms

15:05.200 --> 15:10.160
and it couples yourself with your universe remember to repeat that reality is language

15:10.160 --> 15:17.040
language is reality it's isomorphic with reality it distributes over reality and it couples

15:17.040 --> 15:22.080
yourself as a syntactic operator with the universe this is the big breakthrough the ctmu

15:22.080 --> 15:28.400
if and only confusion i confuse you i'm sorry uh i'm trying to come to better terms of that

15:28.400 --> 15:32.080
myself and i'm trying to come to better terms that by explaining it i'll be putting out future

15:32.080 --> 15:37.680
videos like one an italic principle and one on state versus syntax as building blocks of the ctmu

15:37.680 --> 15:41.920
and finally have a secret project in the works that i got to read the ctmu a couple times over

15:41.920 --> 15:46.560
but a secret project in the works that i think it's going to be big on the ctmu it'll long

15:46.560 --> 16:03.040
overdue series on the ctmu so until next time take care bye-bye

16:16.560 --> 16:17.440
you
