0	9040	In today's video, we're going to take a look at answering the big question.
9040	21360	What is calculus?
21360	36320	And really, calculus is going to be the answer to three questions.
36320	40200	The first question that we're going to attempt to answer, and we're going to focus on here
40200	55280	in chapter two, is what is it getting close to?
55280	62880	And this in calculus, we're going to affectionately call the limit.
62880	66640	The second question we're going to attempt to answer, and it's really the focus of chapter
66640	76680	three, is what is the slope?
76680	80840	Specifically what is the slope at this given point?
80840	90480	And there we're going to call that in calculus the derivative.
90480	102360	The third question we're going to attempt to answer is what is the area?
102360	107400	And we're not going to really dive into that question until we get to calc two next term,
107400	118200	but for now I'll just tell you that that is the integral of the function.
118200	136640	So to kind of set this up, we're going to take a look at first the tangent problem.
136640	159360	For the tangent problem, I want to first consider how fast these lines are changing.
159360	167000	And we really call that our rate of change.
167000	169440	So I'm going to put three graphs up here.
169440	178600	First graph is going to be y equals two-thirds x minus one.
178600	188120	And this graph, I'll have a y intercept at negative one, and it'll rise two and run three
188120	189120	to another point.
189120	193880	So it's going to look something like that.
193880	208040	The second graph we're going to look at is y equals negative three x plus two.
208040	215960	And so that graph has a y intercept at two, and it slopes down three over one, and it
215960	218440	looks like this guy.
218440	227640	And the third graph we're going to look at is y equals negative one.
227640	233320	And that's just a flat line right at negative one.
233320	237840	And the question here that we're considering is how fast are these lines changing?
237840	239600	How are these lines changing?
239600	245280	The first graph here, the two-thirds x minus one, we see it is going uphill from left to
245280	249720	right, but it's going uphill slowly.
249720	258160	It's kind of gradually working its way uphill, which is different than the second graph because
258160	263040	not only is it going downhill, but it's also going down much quicker.
263040	271280	It's going downhill quickly.
271280	275720	And that's going to be different than this third graph, which really isn't going up or
275720	276720	down.
276720	279040	It's kind of flat lined.
279040	289640	So we'll say this is a flat or no change.
289640	294200	Now what's interesting here is these lines are really easy to see how the graph is changing
294200	295520	because they're just a straight line.
295520	297240	They're always changing at the same rate.
297360	302400	A is always going up slowly, B is always going down quickly, and C is always flat without
302400	303400	any change.
303400	306600	But this is not always the case.
307480	331640	Actually, most functions do not have a constant rate of change.
331640	351720	For example, if we consider the graph, y equals x squared plus two.
351720	358240	Now y equals x squared plus two has a vertex rate at two, it's got the point at one three
358240	370840	and negative one three and then six and negative six, or I'm sorry, three six and three negative
370840	374840	three six.
374840	382560	So here is the graph of x squared plus two.
382560	392480	Now if we consider at the point zero where x is equal to zero, if I were to look at
392480	396680	that graph, it's kind of leveled out there at the bottom, we could draw a line that's
396680	401520	tangent to that point, and right now it has a slope of zero.
401520	403320	It's really not changing at that point.
403320	407400	It's not going up or down, it's kind of leveled out at the bottom.
407400	413040	It's a little different than if I consider the point that's just one to the right, because
413040	418640	at that point it's actually got a much steeper tangent line that could be drawn that barely
418640	421240	attaches it.
421240	426440	And there, the slope of that graph, it's going uphill, it's actually rising two and running
426440	427440	one.
427440	434040	If I could grab a different color, we could look at this point at negative one, or negative
434040	435440	two.
435440	441600	Looking at the point at negative two, we see it's very, very, very steep.
441600	448240	In fact, the slope there is going to be negative four, and we'll talk later about how we can
448240	450720	actually calculate those exact slopes.
450720	455800	But what's interesting here is this graph starts out with a very steep negative slope,
455800	462080	and then it levels out and turns into a positive slope, which gets steeper and steeper.
462080	481600	I've already hinted at this, but the lines that touch the graph
481600	493120	are what we're going to call tangent lines, where they touch the graph in one point and
493120	499920	then go off into the distance.
499920	506960	So the question we're going to attempt to find out is, what is the slope of these tangent
506960	510620	lines?
510620	515060	To do that, we're going to set up another thing called the secant line.
515060	531580	We can actually approximate the rate of change
531580	555180	for a tangent line with what we're going to call a secant line.
555180	560540	Here's what we mean by that.
560540	567500	So we've got some graph here, we're going to say it comes in, goes up, and levels off,
567500	574900	and right here we're going to say is A, means if we go up, this point here is going to be
574900	583740	at F of A, and then a little bit over from A is B, and if we go up from B, that point
583740	599300	right there will be at F of B. If we connect A and B with a line, that is called a secant
599300	600300	line.
600300	603500	A secant line is going to go through two points on the line.
603500	609260	In fact, we know what those two points are, let's go ahead and label those in brown.
609260	615500	The x-coordinate of this first point is A, and the y-coordinate is F of A, and the second
615500	625140	one with B, the x-coordinate is B, and the y-coordinate is F of B. If we wanted to calculate
625140	632740	the slope, which we always use M for slope, of the secant line, we know it's y2 minus
632740	635260	y1 over x2 minus x1.
635260	648940	That would be F of B minus F of A over the B minus the A. This is going to be an important
648940	656420	formula for us, the formula for the slope of the secant line.
656420	671220	What's interesting about this is as A and B get closer and closer together, let's draw
671220	692500	another graph, as A and B get close, let's see if I can draw that same graph on here approximately,
692500	702300	and if we keep A at about the same spot, and so F of A is still at the same spot, but if
702300	712100	we put B right next to it, notice it's closer now for F of B, the secant line that connects
712100	718500	them is starting to look like a tangent line that only touches in one spot.
718500	735460	In other words, as A and B get closer together, we get closer to the tangent line.
735460	740540	This is the big idea that we're going to go after today, is can we get A and B close enough
740540	752900	together so that we can estimate what is the tangent line.
752900	758020	Let's try it though with some numbers in there to make things a little clearer.
758020	772620	So let's do number four, we're going to do an example here, we're going to estimate
772620	793300	the slope and equation, while we're at it, of the tangent line to the function F of x
793300	805220	equals two x squared minus three at the point two comma five.
805220	815260	Now the idea here is we want to estimate what it is using a different x and y point
815260	822060	where we're going to try and get closer and closer and closer to our actual point of two.
822060	826980	So we know at two the y coordinates five, so we'll start kind of close to two, maybe
826980	832980	we'll start at two point one, then we'll get a little closer, two point oh one, then we'll
832980	838420	get a little closer, two point oh oh one, and then finally a little bit closer, two point
838420	843660	oh oh one, and we're going to see what y equals at each of these points.
843660	848940	We know at two it's going to hit five, but what's it going to hit as we get close to
848940	854020	two, as we pull B closer and closer to our A. Fortunately this is going to be really
854020	863500	easy to do on our calculators, so if we turn our calculators on and hit the y equals button,
863500	874700	we can type in our function in y equals, and our function is two x squared minus three.
874700	879260	Then what we're going to do is if we hit the second button, and then right above graph
879260	888540	we see in blue it says table, and we should be able to delete these values out of here.
888540	893740	If you cannot delete the values out of your table, first hit second and then above window
893740	900020	you see it says table set, and we're going to change the independent variable the x to
900020	905620	ask, so that we can pick what we want that x to be equal to.
905620	911140	Now go back to second table, and now we can enter in our values we want for x. The first
911140	918780	value we want is two point one, the second value is two point oh one, the third value
918780	929540	is two point oh one, and the third value is two point oh oh one.
929540	935500	And we start to see we get these values for y. Let's record them in our y column here.
935500	943020	That's five point eighty two, the next one was five point oh eight oh two, the next one
943020	956260	was five point oh oh eight, and then finally it was five point oh oh eight.
956260	962420	So now what we really end up with is a third column, let me label it in black here, x comma
962420	966860	y is going to be our third column, these are going to be our points that we're going to
966860	969660	be compared to the original point of two five.
969660	976500	So x comma y is two point one comma five point eighty two, then we had two point oh one comma
976500	985100	five point oh eight oh two, then we had two point oh oh one comma five point oh oh eight,
985100	994820	and then finally two point oh oh oh one comma five point oh oh oh eight.
994820	1001580	We're going to use these points and the original point, the two comma five, to calculate a
1001580	1008500	whole bunch of slopes of the secant line, and again we're going to use the calculator
1008500	1013220	to help us out with that to make some of these calculations easier.
1013220	1018420	If we hit second quit, it'll take us back to the home screen, quit is right above the
1018420	1024580	mode button, and then we're just going to type in our slope formula where the numerator
1024580	1027340	and denominator need to be in parentheses.
1027340	1033700	So the y two we calculated from the first point was five point eighty two minus the
1033700	1042100	y one was five, because we always go back to the original point, divided by the x one
1042100	1048180	from the point we found, the two point one, whoops need to put it in parentheses, two
1048180	1055100	point one minus the two, close the parentheses, and when we hit enter we find our slope right
1055100	1058220	now is eight point two.
1058220	1065080	So let's go ahead and record that, our slope right now is eight point two, but then we're
1065080	1068460	going to move a little bit closer.
1068460	1072180	Now we're going to use our second point, which is the two point oh one comma five point
1072180	1081340	oh eight oh two, again y two minus y one, so five point oh eight oh two minus the y from
1081340	1089780	our original point of five, divided by the two point oh one minus the two, again remember
1089780	1102160	numerator and denominator in parentheses, and now we have a slope of eight point oh two.
1102160	1110620	Let's try our third point, our third point was five point oh eight minus the five, divided
1110620	1119720	by the two point oh one minus the two, and now we're going to get this nice pretty eight,
1119720	1122960	our slope right now is eight.
1122960	1126080	In fact when we do it again for the third point we're going to get the exact same thing
1126080	1132300	because we are so close, the difference is going to be minuscule, five point oh oh eight
1132300	1142500	minus the five, divided by the two point oh oh one minus the two, and again we get eight
1142500	1148920	for the slope.
1148920	1157700	So we can use this fact to estimate the slope of the tangent line now.
1157700	1162500	We see the slope of the secant line is getting closer and closer to eight point oh, so the
1162500	1167740	slope of the tangent line is probably that eight point oh that we're getting closer and
1167740	1171060	closer to.
1171060	1178960	So if it is eight point oh then we're ready to actually calculate the equation at that
1178960	1183880	point, and going back to our algebra days a good equation to remember that the equation
1183880	1193720	of the line is equal to y equals m times x minus x one plus y one, where x one and y
1193720	1203340	one are a point we know that's on the line, and m is the slope.
1203340	1208580	This is a good equation to commit to memory because we are going to use this equation
1208580	1213660	a lot in this course.
1213660	1218220	So for our purposes we've got y equals m, the slope of the tangent line we just found
1218220	1224440	out was eight times x minus x one, going back to our original point the x coordinate was
1224440	1229400	two plus the y coordinate of five.
1229400	1236080	The equation of our tangent line two x squared minus three at two five is this guy y equals
1236080	1245080	eight times x minus two plus five.
1245080	1253060	We can use this concept in physics to look at what's called the average velocity and
1253060	1256820	the instantaneous velocity.
1256820	1262700	Velocity is really talking about speed, so if we're talking about the average velocity
1262700	1275880	or the average speed, speed doesn't really have direction and velocity does have direction,
1275880	1277040	it's only real different.
1277040	1298940	The average velocity of an object can be found by the velocity average is equal to the function
1298940	1306340	at the first point at the initial point of time minus the function at the final point
1306340	1311680	in time, all over the difference in the times.
1311680	1316040	And really you'll notice that this equation, while I mark it as an important equation that
1316040	1325720	we need to know for our course, it really is the same equation as the secant that we've
1325720	1327400	already worked with.
1327400	1332760	And then if that's the average velocity over an amount of time, we can find the instantaneous
1332760	1345260	velocity
1345260	1349740	or how fast the object is moving at a specific point in time instead of an average over a
1349740	1370480	range, it is found by making T2 closer to T1.
1370480	1374480	In other words, the same idea we did before, if we try closer and closer and closer numbers,
1374480	1378800	we'll get closer and closer to the actual instantaneous velocity, which is the slope
1378800	1381260	of a tangent line.
1381260	1391020	So let's try an example problem where we can see that actually done.
1391020	1415800	Let's see, an object is dropped from the top of a 144 foot cliff
1415800	1431100	and it will land three seconds later.
1431100	1434880	We can actually find the function for its height.
1434880	1450200	Its height is given by the function f of x equals negative, actually let's not do f
1450200	1454560	of x, let's make it more descriptive, we're doing height, so let's say height of T or
1454560	1466240	height of time is equal to negative 16 T squared plus 144.
1466240	1492480	We're going to find the average velocity between 2 seconds and 2.01 seconds and between 1.99
1492480	1494600	seconds and 2 seconds.
1494600	1499960	So the average velocity just after 2 seconds and the average velocity just before 2 seconds
1499960	1504120	and see what we can learn about that.
1504120	1510280	So first for the first point, I'll do this first point in blue, the average velocity,
1510280	1513560	we need to know what the height is at those two points.
1513560	1522280	So we'll say h of 2 and I'm just going to plug this into our calculator.
1522280	1534520	Negative 16 times 2 squared plus 144, when I do that on the calculator we get 80.
1534520	1543120	So the height of 2 is 80 and the height just afterwards at 2.01, again if I plug that into
1543120	1564080	my calculator, negative 16 times 2.01 squared plus 144, that's going to equal 79.3584, 79.35,
1564080	1567240	let's just round it to 8.
1567240	1573400	So the average velocity then is going to be the slope between these two points.
1573400	1586320	So the average velocity is equal to y2, which is 80, minus y1, 79.358 over the difference
1586320	1590640	in the x's, 2 minus 2.01.
1590640	1603680	The average velocity here is negative 64.2 feet per second.
1603680	1609720	So just after 2 seconds the object is moving at 64.2 feet per second, it's negative because
1609720	1611120	it's going down.
1611120	1615080	Let's see what's happening just before, we'll do this in green off to the right here so
1615080	1616600	we can keep these separate.
1616600	1623120	So we need to know what the height is at 1.99 and what the height is at 2, fortunately we
1623120	1627440	already calculated the height at 2, that's 80.
1627440	1635280	If we put the 1.99 in our calculator we'll end up with approximately 80.638, so to find
1635280	1642920	the average velocity here we'll subtract the y's divided by subtracting the x's.
1642920	1654680	So 80.638 minus 80 divided by 1.99 minus 2, and when we do this we find out the average
1654680	1665560	velocity just before 2 seconds is negative 63.8 feet per second.
1665560	1672000	And what you'll notice is both of these are really close, 0.2 away of each side of the
1672040	1694640	negative 64, so we can actually find out or estimate the instantaneous velocity
1694640	1700920	to be somewhere in the middle of these two guys, so between 64.2 and 63.8 it's probably
1700920	1707440	at 2 seconds at that exact moment in time moving approximately negative 64 feet per
1707440	1717560	second, that would be the tangent line or the instantaneous velocity.
1717560	1721280	So with this preview so far we've answered really the first two questions, we've been
1721280	1727360	looking at what is the slope or the tangent and then also what is that secant line getting
1727360	1732800	close to, let's take a look at a little preview of the third question of calculus, we won't
1732800	1736240	spend much time on this because it's really a second quarter calculus question, but the
1736240	1750960	question is what is the area, here's what that looks like in calculus.
1750960	1760480	And back to part C addressing the area problem.
1760480	1775680	We are going to consider, actually let's make this number one, consider the area under y
1775680	1791400	equals x minus three squared plus one between the x values of zero to three.
1791400	1796480	We're going to need a really tall graph for this, that shouldn't be too bad, we've got
1796480	1808800	plenty of space here, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
1808800	1813200	So we know x squared is the parabola shape, the minus three moves it to the right three,
1813200	1826760	the plus one moves it up one.
1826760	1837480	So the graph is going to look something like this, and it wants the area between zero and
1837480	1845800	three, so between zero and three what we're really doing is saying what is the area that
1845800	1858680	fills in underneath the graph, what we want is the area shaded in green here, is how much
1858680	1863800	area is underneath the graph.
1863800	1871480	So we can estimate it, and the way we're going to estimate it is we're going to say, hey,
1871480	1874480	it's really easy to find the area of a rectangle.
1874480	1887360	So we can use rectangles where the right corner of the rectangle actually touches the graph
1887360	1888880	that we're talking about.
1889880	1891880	So let me see if I can recreate the graph here.
1902880	1907880	So it hits at nine, three, one.
1913880	1914880	Is that right?
1914880	1926880	It hits at ten.
1926880	1932160	So here's our graph, roughly drawn, and what we're going to do is we're going to take each
1932160	1942680	point and make it into a rectangle where the right corner of the rectangle touches the graph.
1942680	1951160	So each rectangle is one wide, and the first rectangle is one high, the second rectangle
1951160	1959680	you see is too high, and the third rectangle, I think it's five high?
1959680	1963160	Yeah, it's five high.
1963160	1974520	So we could say that the area under here is five plus two plus one, or the area is approximately
1974520	1984720	eight when we use rectangles on the right side, where the right corner hits the graph.
1984720	1988440	But we could also do it the other way because the problem here is we end up a little bit
1988440	1991640	short.
1991640	1994440	Let's use just some gray space for the short.
1994440	1999760	Notice we miss this gray triangle, and another gray triangle, and another gray triangle.
1999760	2002880	We're short because we went to the right.
2002880	2016880	So to avoid being short, we could draw rectangles that the left corner touches the graph.
2016880	2018640	And see how that compares.
2018640	2024240	So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and one, two, three, four,
2024240	2025240	five.
2025240	2032920	Putting our key points on here of three, one, move over one and up one, over one and up one,
2032920	2044440	two, three, and then finally the nine.
2044440	2049800	So if I wanted to draw rectangles where the left corner touched the graph, we would start
2049800	2056320	at the top point and say, okay, come out from the left corner, and there is my first rectangle.
2056320	2061600	Then come out from the left corner, go over one unit, and there's your next.
2061600	2064520	And come out from the left, and there's our next rectangle.
2064520	2068600	And so we end up with three rectangles again.
2068600	2072080	And we can find the area of those rectangles.
2072080	2076280	The first rectangle on the left has a height of ten.
2076280	2088480	Actually, let's put, whoops, let's put, ah, wrong color.
2088480	2093480	Let's put the heights on the right here.
2093480	2097880	The height of ten, the second rectangle is a height of one, two, three, four, five, and
2097880	2102200	the third rectangle has a height of two.
2102200	2109160	So when we add those together, the area that we end up with is going to be ten plus five
2109160	2110760	plus two.
2110760	2117640	The area comes out to be approximately seventeen.
2117640	2120380	But again, we've got a problem.
2120380	2124120	Because now instead of having too little area, we end up with too much area.
2124120	2128760	We've kind of got this area that I'm going to color in in gray that sticks up above the
2128760	2131160	graph.
2131160	2136040	So the first time we were too low, the second time we're too high.
2136040	2142920	How are we going to estimate what the actual value is?
2142920	2152000	Well, we could estimate, since we're just estimating, the actual area is in the middle
2152000	2156480	of these two values.
2156480	2162720	So we could just average the eight and seventeen, eight plus seventeen divided by two.
2162720	2168520	When we do that, we get a twelve point five.
2168520	2175760	So we're going to say our final estimate is that the area underneath y equals x minus
2175760	2177960	three squared plus one between zero and three.
2177960	2181040	We're going to estimate that it's about twelve point five.
2181040	2193600	Well, as you might expect, this process is not perfect because actually the actual area
2193600	2195880	is twelve exactly.
2195880	2199400	So we've got an extra point five out of it, but that's not a bad estimate for just kind
2199400	2203840	of drawing rectangles and estimating and making a guess at it.
2203840	2209200	Now in calc two, we'll talk about some methods to find that exact area of twelve, but for
2209200	2214200	now I just want to kind of expose you, this whole lesson today is just a preview of calculus.
2214200	2221140	Just expose you to the idea of the three questions that we're going to be addressing in calculus.
2221140	2222800	What is it getting close to?
2222800	2224040	We call that a limit.
2224040	2226640	We're going to focus on that in chapter two.
2226640	2227980	What is the slope?
2227980	2232240	We call that the derivative and we'll focus on finding that in chapter three.
2232240	2234040	And then finally, what is the area?
2234040	2239040	We call that the integral and we're going to find that in calc two.
2239040	2241560	So I hope you enjoyed this preview of calculus.
2241560	2245440	Take a look at the practice problems in the book and I'll look forward to seeing you in
2245440	2248480	class.
2248480	2254360	As we dive into our study of calculus, we need to answer the first foundational question
2254360	2261600	of what is a limit?
2261600	2266080	So we're going to answer that question kind of broadly today and then a little bit later
2266080	2268600	we'll answer it more precisely.
2268600	2285880	So we're going to kind of say the intuitive definition of a limit.
2285880	2295360	So the general idea that we're going for when we say a limit, we're saying what value,
2295360	2315520	what should be there, even if it is not there?
2315520	2320520	What should be in the function, even if it's not actually in the function at that point?
2320520	2332760	And symbolically how we'll represent that is we will say that the limit as x approaches
2332760	2342040	some number of f of x equals l or the limit.
2342040	2350960	So again, mathematically or in words what those symbols up above there mean is that
2350960	2371080	as x gets closer to a, the f of x gets closer to l.
2371080	2377360	So we're trying to figure out what is the function approaching?
2377360	2389080	What is it getting closer to as our x gets closer to some value of a?
2389080	2393240	So there's two main ways that we're going to do this.
2393240	2405000	The first way that we can find a limit is what we're going to call the table method,
2405000	2409760	where we basically take that definition that says as x gets closer to a, well let's try
2409760	2412120	and get closer to a.
2412120	2425640	We're going to try values closer and closer to a or to that number that x is supposed to
2425640	2427280	get close to.
2427280	2438240	So what I mean by that is we are going to find the limit as x approaches two of x squared
2438240	2443600	minus four over x minus two.
2443600	2449920	Now if I were to just try and find what two actually equals in this function, you'll notice
2449920	2451920	it's going to end up being undefined.
2451920	2455160	There's actually nothing at two.
2455160	2458680	But we're not interested in what's actually happening at two.
2458680	2465240	We're interested in what should be at two, even if it's not at two.
2465240	2469800	So to set this up, we're going to make a table where we're going to take various values of
2469800	2475720	x that are going to get closer and closer to two, and we're going to see how that compares
2475720	2479400	to f of x or our function.
2479400	2485120	So we'll start maybe at 1.9, that's a little shy of two, and then we'll get closer, 1.99.
2485120	2491920	And then a little closer, 1.999, and even closer, 1.9999, we're going to get really
2491920	2496080	close to two and see what happens to f.
2496080	2500160	Now an important part of a limit is it has to work on both sides.
2500160	2503840	So we can't just do values a little bit smaller than two.
2503840	2510360	We need to pick values for x and calculate f of x that are a little bit bigger than two.
2510360	2517560	So we might start with 2.1, go a little bit closer, 2.01, a little bit closer, 2.001,
2517560	2522840	and a little bit closer, 2.001.
2522840	2527600	Now fortunately our calculators' table settings are going to make these calculations quite
2527600	2529440	nice for us.
2529440	2535520	So if we turn on our calculator and go into the y equals function, I can hit clear to
2535520	2538440	delete anything that might be in there already.
2538440	2542800	And the function we're working with is x squared minus four over x minus two.
2542800	2547160	Now to preserve the order of operations, I need to put in parentheses the numerator
2547160	2548280	and denominator.
2548280	2558120	So x squared minus four, close the parentheses, divided by, open up parentheses, x minus two,
2558120	2561080	and close the parentheses.
2561080	2567280	And now we'll go to our table by hitting second table, and there's values in here from a previous
2567280	2572200	problem we don't need, so I'm going to delete those all out.
2572200	2582720	Our x's here, go start at 1.9, enter, then we've got 1.99, oops, too many nines, enter,
2582720	2601080	then three nines, 1.999, and then finally 1.999, four nines.
2601080	2603280	There we go.
2603280	2607960	And what we see is we get 3.9, 3.99, 3.999, so let's record these.
2607960	2616800	So first we start with 3.9, then f of x becomes 3.99, then it became 3.999, then it became
2616800	2619800	3.999.
2619800	2624960	You can kind of see that's getting closer and closer to a very clear number, but to
2624960	2627680	check it we have to go on the other side.
2627680	2635080	So let's delete out what's in the table here, and let's check these other values.
2635080	2648920	The 2.1, the 2.01, the 2.001, oops, too many zeros again, and then the 2.0001.
2648920	2652280	And we kind of see the same pattern here, it won't always be a clear pattern like this,
2652280	2661480	but this one's kind of nice, so we can record our f of x became 4.1, 4.01, 4.001, and then
2661480	2666720	finally 4.0001.
2666720	2672240	And what we see is from the left side these numbers are getting closer to four, growing
2672240	2674000	and growing and growing to four.
2674000	2678200	From the right side these values are also getting closer and closer, shrinking and shrinking
2678200	2681560	down to four as we shrink and shrink down to two.
2681560	2690880	And so what we can say then is that the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus four
2690880	2697240	over x minus two seems to be from this table equal to four.
2697240	2702040	Now this doesn't mean that x squared minus four over x minus two is equal to four when
2702040	2704600	x is two, because it's undefined at that point.
2704600	2706040	There's nothing there.
2706040	2710180	The limit is just what should be there even if it's not.
2710180	2713240	So we'd say four probably should be in there, but it's not.
2713240	2718680	As we get really close to two we're getting really close to four.
2718680	2725360	Let's try another example.
2725360	2731640	The table method's really nice when it works, but it doesn't always work as beautifully as
2731640	2733120	we would hope.
2733120	2744200	We're going to find the limit as x approaches zero of the cosine of one over x.
2744200	2748480	And again, just like before, we're going to take some values for x that are a little
2748480	2749480	bit smaller.
2749480	2750960	It's a little bit smaller than zero.
2750960	2756560	Might be negative point one, negative point oh one, negative point oh oh one, negative
2756560	2762360	point oh oh oh one, and we're going to find what f of x equals.
2762360	2767080	And then we'll try some values for x that are just to the right of zero.
2767080	2773800	Point one, point oh one, point oh oh one, and point oh oh oh one.
2773800	2779760	Getting closer and closer to zero from each side.
2779760	2782880	Again we're going to have our calculator do the dirty work for us, but we need to change
2782880	2786480	the function so we'll clear out the old function.
2786480	2795160	Starting with our function is cosine of one over x, close the parentheses.
2795160	2799920	Now something to check if I hit the mode button, which is right next to second, I should see
2799920	2802200	that radians is highlighted.
2802200	2807620	We will always be in radians in this course, so make sure the radians is highlighted.
2807620	2812680	So we've got the cosine of one over x, and then when we go to our table, hit second table,
2812680	2816200	I've got to delete out the old values.
2816200	2826160	And for the first column we've got negative point one, negative point oh one, then we've
2826160	2834440	got negative point oh oh one, whoops got an extra zero, negative point oh oh one, and
2834440	2840840	finally negative point oh oh oh one.
2840840	2845080	And this guy seems quite all over the board.
2845080	2851320	What you see is f of x begins by equaling negative point eight three nine one, then it was positive
2851320	2858940	point eight six two three, then it was positive point five six two three eight, then it was
2858940	2867840	negative again at point nine five two two.
2867840	2872400	Let's try, delete these out, let's try the other side, see what patterns we see on the
2872400	2873600	other side.
2873600	2885440	Point one, point oh one, point oh oh one, and point oh oh oh one.
2885440	2891860	We get actually the exact same numbers with the exact same randomness, f of x seems to
2891860	2901540	be negative point eight three nine one, point eight six two three two, and then point five
2901540	2910020	six two three eight, and then finally negative point nine five two two.
2910020	2915460	Now in the first example, coming from the left we started approaching a number, and coming
2915460	2920660	from the right we started approaching a number, but this time we don't seem to be doing that,
2920660	2936900	we are not approaching any one value, which actually if we were to graph this function
2936900	2944300	using a graphing calculator or maybe a great website is Desmos where you can graph it,
2944300	2948580	this graph kind of goes up and down and then it starts to become really crazy as it gets
2948580	2952460	next to zero and then it just becomes really crazy.
2952460	2960140	So it's really hard to see what's happening because it's going crazy, it's not approaching
2960140	2967940	any one value, so in this case when our table method fails we say the limit as x equals
2967940	2980140	zero, actually let's do this in red, we will say the limit as x equals zero or x approaches
2980140	2987300	zero of cosine of one over x equals d and e which is going to be an abbreviation for
2987300	2998780	does not exist because it's not approaching any one value, it's kind of going all over
2998780	3006580	the place, we're going to say this limit does not exist.
3006580	3011740	So our first strategy for finding the limit is what's called the table method, we take
3011740	3020140	values that are closer and closer to the number we want and see what the function is getting
3020140	3024500	closer and closer to on both the left and right side.
3024500	3029500	The second method is what's called the graph method where we can actually look at the
3029500	3050060	graph and see what y value is the graph approaching.
3050060	3074700	So let's draw a graph here that we can play with and let's see we're going to put a vertical
3074700	3085740	asymptote here at two, I'm going to put a point at negative one comma three, I'm going to put
3085740	3091820	a whole at one comma two but I'm also going to put a point at one comma negative one,
3091820	3102420	I'm also going to put a point at two comma one and then an open point at two comma negative
3102420	3110780	one, I'm going to bring the graph down from that two comma negative one starting at the
3110780	3124260	asymptote, I'm going to come up from the asymptote and then kind of go through my points.
3124260	3129700	So we got this funky looking graph, a lot of weird things happening but that's okay.
3129700	3133780	The first question we're going to attempt to answer is to see if we can find the limit
3133780	3139980	as x approaches negative one of this function.
3139980	3147540	So as x approaches negative one what we see is the graph is really approaching a y value
3147540	3149780	of three.
3149780	3158820	So we will say the limit as x approaches negative one on this graph is three.
3158820	3166500	What's the limit as x approaches positive one of this graph?
3166500	3172460	Now it's interesting to note that positive one, this graph clearly is equal to negative
3172460	3174740	one because that's where the solid dot is.
3174740	3181660	There is an open dot on the graph which means there's a hole that's not actually there but
3181660	3186700	with limits we're interested in what actually should be there even if it's missing and you
3186700	3192900	see the graph coming in from both the left and the right are really getting close to
3192900	3196840	a height of two.
3196840	3202100	And so we'll say this graph is getting closer and closer to two as we get closer and closer
3202100	3204420	to one.
3204420	3209540	Even though if I were to ask what f of one is, f of one is actually equal to negative
3209540	3213540	one but it doesn't matter what the point actually is.
3213540	3221540	What matters is what is the point getting closer and closer to?
3221540	3222540	One more.
3222540	3228580	Let's take the limit as x approaches two of f of x.
3228580	3232740	Now at two this is interesting because at two from the left side, let me see if I can
3232740	3243420	get rid of some of this red, it's kind of getting in the way.
3243420	3249020	At two we see from the left side the graph is getting close to one but when we come in
3249020	3255420	from the right side it seems the graph is getting closer and closer to negative one.
3255420	3260620	Since those are not the same values, it's not approaching the same value from both sides,
3260620	3265420	we have to say that this limit does not exist because we're not approaching one value.
3265420	3270580	We can't say there's one value that should be there because it's really approaching two
3270580	3274100	different values.
3274100	3278900	Which kind of sets up the idea that if we're approaching one value on the left and one value
3278900	3285300	on the right, why don't we call those two different limits?
3285300	3295700	And that sets up this idea of what we're going to call a one-sided limit.
3295700	3303420	Where we have this notation of the limit as x approaches some number a and we'll put a
3303420	3310500	little negative sign like a superscript of f of x and when we see that negative sign,
3310500	3319900	that negative sign means I'm only interested in coming from the left side, coming from
3319900	3328700	where all the negatives are on the left side of the graph versus if I want the limit as
3328700	3336940	x approaches a with a little positive subscript, that positive superscript means I only want
3336940	3346220	to come from the right side.
3346220	3368580	So for example, if I have a graph like this, let's say it comes down kind of like x squared
3368580	3374060	up until we have a gap at one, an empty hole at one, and it's going to drop down to negative
3374060	3385220	two and become a straight line from there.
3385220	3389300	So now I can ask, what is the limit as x approaches one?
3389300	3395140	Even though it approaches two different values at one, if I put a little negative superscript,
3395140	3399780	that means I'm only interested in coming in from the left side.
3399780	3408220	And so when I come in from the left side, we see it's approaching positive one, which
3408220	3413060	is different than if I ask for the limit as x approaches one from the right side of the
3413060	3415460	function.
3415460	3421220	Coming in from the right side of the function, it's going down here to a y value of negative
3421220	3425660	two.
3425660	3431620	So now we can calculate the limits if we specify if we're coming from the left or the right
3431620	3434340	side.
3434340	3439980	Notice however, we still cannot say the limit as x approaches one because these are not
3439980	3441620	approaching the same value.
3441620	3447660	From one side it's one, from the other side it's negative two, it does not exist.
3447660	3465780	In fact it only exists if the left and right are the same.
3465780	3469380	Now if they happen to both be the same, that's great, then it exists.
3469380	3475460	But if they're not the same, then it's not going to work.
3475460	3479940	Let's look at the idea of one-sided limits, not with the graph method, but with the table
3479940	3485500	method that we did at the beginning of this lecture.
3485500	3492280	Number two, let's make what's called a piecewise function.
3492280	3500340	If f of x is equal to, and it's got two parts, it's equal to x minus two if x is less than
3500340	3509540	one, and it's equal to x squared plus one if x is greater than or equal to one.
3509540	3513660	So just like before it's got one part on the left and one part on the right, we use one
3513660	3521440	equation for small values of x, we use another equation for bigger values of x.
3521440	3532160	So we're going to use a table to find three things.
3532160	3541280	The limit as x goes to one from the left of f of x, the limit as x goes to one from the
3541280	3550400	right of f of x, and then we're going to use that to decide if the limit as x goes to one
3550400	3559120	of f of x actually exists, and if it exists, what is that number?
3559120	3565800	So let's start with the table on the left side.
3565800	3570440	We're going to look at values of x from the left of one, which means we want to be a little
3570440	3579760	bit less than one, so maybe 0.9, getting closer 0.99, getting closer 0.99, and then even closer
3579760	3589840	0.9999 to see what the f of x equals.
3589840	3595120	So on our calculator we'll hit y equals, clear out the old equation.
3595120	3602200	When we're on the left, we're smaller than one, so smaller than one is going to be x
3602200	3608480	minus two, because x is smaller than one, and we'll hit second table to weed out the
3608480	3612680	old values, because they aren't doing us any good.
3612680	3629360	The new values are 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, and 0.499.
3629360	3636400	And what we see is essentially what we're ending up with is negative 1.1, negative 1.01, negative
3636400	3647040	1.001, and ultimately pretty much negative one when we round it off.
3647040	3656080	So what that tells me then is that the limit as x approaches one from the left, using numbers
3656080	3666360	slightly smaller of f of x, we're approaching or getting closer to negative one.
3666360	3671760	Now let's look at the right side.
3671760	3680480	Using x values to the right, slightly higher than one, we might start with 1.1, 1.01, 1.001,
3680480	3688840	and 1.001, and we're going to see what happens to f of x.
3688840	3693820	The key here now is I have to go to y equals and delete out my old function, or clear out
3693820	3699420	my old function, because now that x is bigger than one, we have to use the other equation,
3699420	3705220	the second equation, which is x squared plus one.
3705220	3717540	And when we hit second table and clear out the old values, our new values are 1.1, 1.01,
3718380	3732260	and 1.001, and we see a definite pattern emerging as we fill in our f of x column.
3732260	3745540	That was 2.21, 2.0201, 2.002, and 2.0002, but we see those are definitely approaching
3745540	3754060	a clear number, so we can announce that the limit as x approaches one from the right of
3754060	3763540	f of x using slightly bigger numbers, we're getting closer and closer to two.
3763540	3770140	So what does it all mean about the limit as x approaches one of f of x overall?
3770140	3774140	Well because the left and right are approaching different numbers, one's approaching negative
3774140	3782460	one and one's approaching positive two, these are not the same, so the limit does not exist
3782460	3789700	purely at one.
3789700	3794980	Now there is another case that I want to look at of what can happen as you're trying to
3794980	3812300	make your table, like we're up to E now, what I'm going to call infinite limits.
3812300	3828420	For example, if I take the limit as x approaches three, we'll go from the left this time of
3828420	3836900	one over x minus three, didn't need to be in parentheses, but it will be in parentheses
3836900	3841420	for our calculator anyways, so we're going to look at values for x and see how our f
3841420	3843420	of x compares.
3843420	3847540	I set only on the left, so we need a little bit smaller than three, we'll start at two
3847540	3853580	point nine, then we'll try two point nine nine, two point nine nine, and two point nine
3853580	3860540	nine nine to get us really, really close.
3860540	3867300	Hit y equals, clear out the function one divided by in parentheses, so we don't lose our order
3867300	3877060	of operations, x minus three, close the parentheses, and then we'll head to our table, second table,
3877060	3884500	clear out these numbers because we're interested in two point nine, two point nine nine, two
3884500	3895340	point nine nine nine, and two point nine nine nine nine, and there's a clear pattern here,
3895340	3908900	we go from negative ten to negative a hundred to negative one thousand to negative ten thousand,
3908900	3914020	so when we're trying to calculate the limit as x goes to three from the left of one over
3914020	3918660	x minus three, we see it's not necessarily approaching any one number, but it's definitely
3918660	3923060	going somewhere specifically, it's getting bigger and bigger, or more and more negative
3923060	3927780	would be a better way to say it, so what I'm going to say is this is actually going to
3927780	3932780	negative infinity, because as I get closer and closer to three, I'm going to get a more
3932780	3940220	and more negative number, in fact a similar thing happens if we go to the other side of
3940220	3945700	the function, let's take the limit as x goes to three from the right of one over x minus
3945700	3954100	three, and look at various values for x and how f of x compares, from the right we need
3954100	3958980	to be slightly bigger than three, so we'll start at three point one, get a little closer,
3958980	3968140	three point oh one, closer three point oh oh one, and closer three point oh oh oh one,
3968140	3974660	and let's see how this compares on our calculator, same function so I don't have to type it in
3974660	3983620	again, but for my x values we're going from three point one to three point oh one to three
3983620	3992660	point oh oh one, whoops got an extra zero, three point oh oh one, and then finally three
3992660	4001100	point oh oh oh one, and we see the exact same pattern starting to happen here, we've got
4001100	4009700	ten, one hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand, the only difference is now the graph is not
4009700	4016440	negative instead it's positive, so the limit as x goes to three from the right of one over
4016440	4023620	x minus three, it's getting bigger and bigger and positive so we will say it's going to
4023620	4033100	be positive infinity, so our limits can actually be infinite, positive or negative infinity
4033100	4039060	if it truly is getting bigger and bigger or negative bigger and bigger without bound,
4039060	4054900	and what this actually means about the graph, this means the graph has a vertical asymptote
4054900	4074200	at three, or x equals three would be a better way to say it, in other words if I were to
4074200	4078740	sketch a graph of this guy really quick and I'll just make a small version of it one,
4078740	4085860	two, three, at three there's going to be a vertical asymptote and the graph is going
4085860	4092100	to bend around that vertical asymptote, and so you see when we're approaching from the
4092100	4096420	left it's going down to negative infinity and when we're approaching three from the
4096420	4110540	right it goes to positive infinity, before we wrap up here let's do one more problem
4110540	4119780	where we just find a bunch of limits just to practice, so I'm going to draw a graph
4119780	4139020	on here, we're going to go four each direction, and at negative three comma three we're going
4139020	4149260	to put a point and from that point it's going to curve up to the left, we're also at negative
4149340	4158780	three two going to put an open point, then at negative one comma four we're going to put
4158780	4166860	an open point, and then at two we're going to put a vertical asymptote, so we're going
4166860	4175020	to connect the open point to open point is the maximum and then come down to the asymptote,
4175020	4182660	and then at three comma two we'll put another point and kind of bring the graph down and
4182660	4191340	into that point, I want to put one more point on this graph at negative one comma one, we
4191340	4198460	have that open dot at negative one, the closed point means where the point actually is, might
4198460	4203740	not be where it's supposed to be but that's where it actually is, so I've got nine of
4203740	4211140	these, I want to see if we can calculate, first we're going to find the limit as x approaches
4211140	4222860	negative one of f of x, now at negative one what is the graph getting close to, not where
4222860	4227540	the graph is actually, you'll see from the left and the right the graph is getting closer
4227540	4237340	and closer to a height of four, so we say the limit at negative one is four because that's
4237340	4246900	what should be there even if it's not, notice that's different than asking what is f at
4246900	4252940	negative one, where is f actually at negative one, and at negative one on the curve there's
4252940	4262860	a hole at negative one, the actual negative one point is at a height of one, how about
4262860	4278180	this one, the limit as x approaches negative three from the left of f of x, well at negative
4278180	4287900	three from the left we see this graph is approaching a height of three, we can compare that with
4287900	4296020	the limit as x approaches negative three from the right of f of x, when we come from the
4296020	4303820	right or the positive side notice it comes down a bit lower to a height of two, so the
4303900	4316380	limit there is approaching two, which means if I asked what the limit as x approaches
4316380	4323260	negative three of f of x is, we can see already from the left and the right we're approaching
4323260	4330140	two different values, they're not the same, because they're not the same this limit does
4330140	4345620	not exist, it must be the same to exist, how about the limit as x approaches two from
4345620	4355580	the left of f of x, as we get closer from the left side to two notice this graph is
4355580	4363100	going down to a vertical asymptote, because we're going down all the way this is actually
4363100	4368940	equal to negative infinity, it goes down all the way to infinity before it actually gets
4368940	4379780	to two because it will never touch that vertical asymptote, similarly the limit as x approaches
4379780	4388220	two from the right of f of x, looking at the right side we see the graph is going up, up
4388220	4402580	and up and up without bound or stopping, it's going to be equal to positive infinity, what's
4402580	4414980	the limit as x approaches three of f of x, now three is right where this point is on the
4414980	4419700	right side and notice when we come in from the left or the right it's going to that same
4419700	4426700	height of two, so we'll say the limit is approaching two and what you might also notice is the
4426700	4434820	point that should be there actually is there, so we can also say that f of three is also
4434820	4441860	equal to two, and so when the limit and the point are equal to each other that's significant
4441860	4447900	to us, we say that means the graph is continuous at that point because the limit and the point
4447900	4452500	are the same, but we're going to spend a whole day on continuity a little bit later, right
4452500	4457580	now what's important is that you get very comfortable finding limits both from the graph
4457580	4464260	method and also from the table method, so take a look at some of the assignments in the book
4464260	4473140	and I look forward to seeing you in class so that we can discuss these limits in more detail.
4473140	4488820	Today we're going to take a look at the question, how can we evaluate limits?
4488820	4492980	In our last lesson we looked at how we can use a table or a graph to evaluate a limit
4492980	4497700	by getting closer and closer to a specific value, what we're going to do today is take
4497700	4506340	a look at some limit laws that we can use to help us find limits quicker and more accurately.
4506340	4517620	First there are two basic limit laws.
4517620	4527100	The first is that the limit as x approaches a of x, since x is a straight line with no
4527100	4532500	holds or gaps or any funny actions happening on the graph, we can say that that limit is
4532500	4539380	going to equal whatever number we're checking on the graph.
4539380	4547460	The second limit is as x approaches a of some constant where c is just any number but there's
4547460	4556420	no x's in there, then that is going to always approach that constant or c.
4556420	4562060	These two are our basic limit laws and important that we should be very comfortable calculating
4562060	4566500	those limits as soon as we see them.
4566500	4573980	So for example if I ask what is the limit as x goes to negative four of x, we should
4573980	4580300	know right away that's going to equal the number or the negative four.
4580300	4587300	Similarly if I want to know what the limit is as x approaches seven of two, two is just
4587300	4589780	a number or a constant.
4589780	4595540	This function is always equal to two regardless of what x is, so even at seven x is still
4595540	4600420	or the function is still equal to two.
4600420	4608340	In addition to the basic limit laws, there are six other properties of limits or limit
4608340	4617300	laws that we should be comfortable working with.
4617300	4621380	We'll list all six here and then we'll look at some examples of how these limit laws can
4621380	4623860	be worked out.
4623860	4631900	First is the sum or difference as they both work the same.
4631900	4637460	And the idea here is if we take the limit as x approaches some number a of two parts
4637460	4645380	that are added together, maybe f of x plus g of x, that is actually the same as if we
4645380	4652100	took the limits of the two parts individually, the limit as x approaches a of the f of x,
4652100	4657780	and added the limit as x approaches a of g of x.
4657780	4663620	If we take the two parts individually, we'll get the same result and it works for subtraction
4663620	4669980	also, so I'm going to change this to plus or minus.
4669980	4680020	The next limit law is what we call the constant multiplier, where we're going to take the
4680020	4690780	limit as x approaches a of some constant times something with x in it.
4690780	4695860	The way we can work here is that constant actually is multiplied by whatever the limit
4695860	4705540	as x approaches a of that function actually is.
4705540	4716740	We also have the product rule, which says if I want the limit as x approaches a of f
4716740	4725180	of x times g of x, two things multiplied together, we can actually take the limits of the two
4725180	4733060	parts, the limit as x approaches a of the first part, times the limit as x approaches
4733060	4739500	a of the second part, or the g of x.
4739500	4747500	Same idea works for a quotient, because really multiplication and division are just inverse
4747500	4757500	reciprocals of each other, so limit as x approaches a of f of x divided by g of x, that is equal
4757500	4774580	to the limit as x approaches a of f of x divided by the limit as x approaches a of g of x.
4774580	4778140	We also have what's called the power rule.
4779140	4788780	The power rule says if I'm interested in finding a limit as x approaches a of some function
4788780	4796260	that is raised to some type of exponent, we can find the limit first and then raise the
4796260	4811300	answer to some exponent, and because exponents and radicals are really the same thing, we
4811300	4820280	can extend this to number six, what we call the radical rule, which is that the limit
4820280	4828680	as x approaches a of the square root of some function is equal to the square root of the
4828680	4840400	limit, so I'm going to highlight all six of these limit laws as important limit laws that
4840400	4847400	we know and understand, but this is a case, as is often the case with calculus, is it's
4847400	4853880	more important that we understand how to use the six rules than it is that we can actually
4853880	4859520	quote the six rules from memory, because if we understand the process of what we're doing,
4859520	4864360	we just have to straight out solve the problems instead of going through memorizing a whole
4864360	4869840	bunch of formulas, which should not be the goal in any calculus class.
4869840	4875600	Basically what we're saying here is that we can take the limits of the pieces we can,
4875600	4879760	and we can add and subtract them, we've got constant multipliers, limit pieces can be
4879760	4886080	multiplied, divided, exponents, radicals, we can just take the limits of the individual
4886080	4888600	pieces.
4888600	4899400	Maybe it's easier to explain with some examples.
4899400	4912200	If we want the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus three x plus four.
4912200	4917260	We know from our limit laws that this added and subtracted can be broken into three pieces.
4917260	4922120	We also know that the exponents and constants can be pulled outside of the limit, so what
4922120	4931280	this really means we can do is we can take the limit as x approaches two of the x and
4931280	4947200	then square it minus three times the limit as x approaches two of the x and add four.
4947200	4955920	We add the limit as x approaches two of the four.
4955920	4963320	We have the two basic limit laws that says the limit of x is the number and that the
4963320	4966760	limit of a constant is equal to the constant.
4966760	4976160	If we plug that in, the limit as x approaches two of x becomes two squared minus three times
4976160	4982120	the limit as x approaches two of x is just two plus four.
4982120	4991640	I can plug this into my calculator and we'll end up with two.
4991640	4994960	Let's try another one.
4994960	5003720	The limit as x approaches negative one of the square root of x plus five.
5003800	5010320	Limits go through exponents, radicals, pluses, minuses, fractions, so what we really can
5010320	5020320	say is this is the square root of the limit as x goes to negative one of x plus the limit
5020320	5028120	as x goes to negative one of five.
5028120	5033280	We know the limit of x is the number, the limit of a constant is the constant.
5033280	5041720	This is the square root of negative one plus five, which is the square root of four or
5041720	5049480	also two.
5049480	5053040	What you might notice here is instead of doing all the work of putting that limit through
5053040	5059400	all the pieces, what we're really doing is whenever possible, we're taking the number
5059400	5065720	we're working with and plugging it in to the x.
5065720	5083160	In summary, what we're really doing is what's called direct substitution.
5083160	5090920	In other words, if I had an example like the limit as x approaches one of x squared minus
5090920	5100680	four over x squared plus two x plus one, what that really means is we can put the one in
5100680	5104080	for the x to see what's happening around one.
5104880	5113440	If I put the one in, we get one squared minus four over one squared plus two times one plus
5113440	5115900	one.
5115900	5122560	One minus four is negative three and one plus two plus one is four and so the limit as x
5122560	5128240	approaches one is negative three-fourths.
5128240	5135560	In summary, the easiest way we can calculate a limit is to directly plug that number into
5135560	5137080	the function.
5137080	5141920	However, that doesn't always work perfectly.
5141920	5148560	We've got a couple techniques to handle what we do if direct substitution doesn't quite
5148560	5149560	work.
5149560	5168640	First let's call this additional techniques that we will use when substitution does not
5168640	5176520	work.
5176520	5186600	First we're going to find the limit as x approaches negative three of x squared plus four x plus
5186600	5198040	three over two x squared plus five x minus three.
5198040	5204600	What I want to notice is when we plug negative three in, especially interested in the denominator,
5204600	5214280	we get two times nine minus fifteen minus three which is zero.
5214280	5230280	What we're noticing is substitution divides by zero.
5230280	5231600	We can't divide by zero.
5231600	5235640	We can't have zero in the denominator.
5235640	5238920	We need an additional technique.
5238920	5252480	Our additional technique is going to be to factor and reduce.
5252480	5258080	Hopefully when we do this, we'll be able to actually take the limit through direct substitution.
5258080	5262400	We're going to take the limit as x goes to negative three.
5262400	5264160	The numerator factors nicely.
5264160	5265920	X squared is x times x.
5265920	5270320	Three is three times one.
5270320	5275280	Both positive gives us four x in the middle.
5275280	5279440	In the denominator, two x squared is two x times x.
5279440	5281680	Three is three times one.
5281680	5284040	Is that the right order?
5284040	5285520	Six and one.
5285960	5290880	If we do plus six and a minus one, it will work.
5290880	5297080	What's really nice there is now you see that x plus three reduces out.
5297080	5309680	We're left with the limit as x goes to negative three of x plus one over two x minus one.
5309680	5315480	Now direct substitution works great because no longer does our denominator equal zero.
5315480	5317360	We're no longer dividing by zero.
5317360	5325160	Instead, we have negative three plus one over two times negative three minus one, which
5325160	5334040	is negative two over negative seven, and a negative divided by a negative is a positive.
5334040	5342320	For our final answer, this limit equals two sevenths.
5342320	5347920	Our first technique, if we're dividing by zero, we can factor and hopefully reduce
5347920	5353160	out the part that equals zero.
5353160	5356400	Here's a second problem.
5356400	5366600	The limit as x goes to eight of the square root of x plus one minus three over x minus
5366600	5368160	eight.
5369160	5374600	Again, we have the same note.
5374600	5382400	If we substitute in the denominator, eight minus eight will be zero.
5382400	5395800	Substitution divides by zero.
5395800	5397040	We can't do that.
5397120	5400080	We need another trick.
5400080	5403520	This time we can't factor because there's a radical in there.
5403520	5409560	However, there's a trick that we use with radicals.
5409560	5419520	If radicals are getting inconvenient, we'll get rid of the radicals by multiplying by
5419520	5424360	the conjugate.
5424360	5428320	This is similar to what we did in pre-calculus and algebra.
5428320	5432360	When we were rationalizing the denominator, we multiplied by the conjugate.
5432360	5437000	This time we're going to rationalize the numerator and see if that helps us.
5437000	5440360	We'll change the sign in the middle.
5440360	5441360	Everything else is the same.
5441360	5445320	The square root of x plus one and three is the same, but instead of subtracting, we're
5445320	5452360	going to add the numerator and the denominator.
5452360	5458200	When we do that, the numerator becomes nice, limit as x goes to eight still.
5458200	5462720	Because these are conjugates, a sum and a difference, the first part is squared.
5462720	5468720	When we square a square root, we just get the inside stuff, x plus one.
5468720	5475760	Then it's always a minus, and then we square the last part, three squared is nine.
5475760	5478720	Over, let's keep the denominator factored.
5478720	5487400	X minus eight times the square root of x plus one plus three.
5487400	5494680	That's nice because in the numerator, we can simplify and notice one minus nine is x minus
5494680	5500320	eight.
5500320	5503080	We still have the same denominator.
5503080	5507280	Don't need to multiply that out because we want to stay factored so we can divide out
5507280	5510800	that x minus eight.
5510800	5516200	Remember if everything divides out, there's still a one up there that doesn't disappear.
5516200	5526640	Now we're taking the limit as x goes to eight of one over the square root of x plus one
5526640	5531560	plus three.
5531560	5540360	Now we can plug our number in because the denominator no longer will equal zero.
5540360	5547160	We have one over the square root, plugging eight in, eight plus one plus three equals
5547160	5552720	one over the square root of nine is three plus three is sixth.
5552720	5563560	We now know our limit is one sixth.
5563560	5578000	Another example, let's find the limit as x approaches three of one over x plus two minus
5578000	5586960	one over five all over x minus three.
5586960	5592560	Again we have the same notes, the same problem.
5592560	5600080	Substitution means we're dividing by zero, we can't divide by zero.
5600920	5607960	However we've dealt with complex fractions, fractions and fractions before.
5607960	5623760	We multiply top and bottom by the least common denominator which in this case is a five and
5623760	5625760	an x plus two.
5625760	5632440	So we'll multiply by five x plus two and just distribute it through five x plus two and
5632440	5639600	the denominator also by five x plus two.
5639600	5645680	When we do that the x plus twos and the fives divide out, be careful with the negative,
5645680	5649920	it's going to have to distribute through the parentheses, don't get in trouble with that
5649920	5650920	negative.
5650920	5656600	Get us some more whiteboard space.
5656600	5664840	So now we have the limit as x goes to three of five minus x minus two distributing the
5664840	5677400	negative all the way through all over x minus three times five times x plus two.
5677400	5686400	Line up by combining like terms in the numerator, the limit as x goes to three of three minus
5686400	5697520	x over x minus three times five times x plus two.
5697520	5702320	We've got our subtraction backwards with the three minus x and the x minus three but that's
5702320	5706520	okay because if we remember from pre-calc those can reduce out if there's a negative
5706520	5713440	one left behind, the negative one swaps the order of the subtraction.
5713440	5724400	So now we have the limit as x goes to three of negative one over five times x plus two.
5724400	5730520	Now we can do direct substitution because no longer are we dividing by zero.
5730520	5739400	So negative one over five times three plus two which is negative one over five times five
5739400	5742880	or twenty-five.
5742880	5746000	So there's three tricks here and these three tricks are going to come back again when we're
5746000	5750720	talking about derivatives so it's good to take a moment to go over what we just did.
5750720	5757400	The first trick we did is we can find a limit by factoring and reducing.
5757400	5764520	We also can get rid of radicals by multiplying by conjugates and we also can get rid of complex
5764520	5769760	fractions by multiplying top and bottom by the LCD.
5769760	5776520	Three tricks that are going to be very useful to us so that we can use that direct substitution
5776520	5784640	in order to find a limit.
5784640	5788660	So we're talking about finding limits though, I want to go back to the discussion we had
5788660	5795880	about the two-sided limits and how we can handle those.
5795880	5802440	If you remember in our previous lesson we talked about coming in from the left and coming
5802440	5804080	in from the right.
5804080	5818240	So for a two-sided limits the left and the right must be equal.
5818240	5827920	So if we're working with a piecewise function like f of x is equal to x plus three if x
5827920	5835800	is greater than negative three and it's equal to x squared if x is less than or equal to
5835800	5843520	negative three, we need to consider at negative three what's happening on the left and the
5843520	5846080	right.
5846080	5857120	So first let's look at the limit as x approaches negative three from the left of f of x.
5857120	5862320	From the left we're dealing with smaller values of negative three, smaller values less than
5862320	5864560	or equal to three is x squared.
5864560	5870720	So we'll directly plug in the negative three into the x squared or negative three squared
5870720	5873560	which is nine.
5873560	5882520	Let's compare that with the limit as x approaches negative three from the right of f of x.
5882520	5887960	And from the right we're talking about bigger values or x is greater than negative three.
5887960	5898360	So that's the x plus three direct substitution, negative three plus three is equal to zero
5898360	5905400	and what you'll notice is those two limits are not the same.
5905400	5913520	So what does that mean about the limit as x approaches three of f of x?
5913520	5921400	Well we know it does not exist.
5921400	5932440	Let's do one more example of a two-sided limit with a piecewise function.
5932440	5945280	Let's look at f of x equals two x if x is less than two and x squared if x is greater
5945280	5948880	than or equal to two.
5948880	5950760	So what's the limit at two?
5950760	5954480	Well we've got to come in from each side.
5954480	5960840	The limit as x approaches two from the left of f of x, from the left those are the smaller
5960840	5963120	values where x is less than two.
5963120	5965160	So let's plug in two.
5965160	5971080	Two times two is equal to four.
5971080	5978200	Looking at the other side the limit as x approaches two from the right of f of x, coming from
5978200	5983200	the right means we want bigger values or when x is greater than or equal to two.
5983200	5986640	So we'll plug it into x squared.
5986640	5991760	Two squared is equal to four.
5991760	5999720	This time you notice we have the same value for both the left and the right-sided limits.
5999720	6005920	When we have the same value then we can say the limit as x approaches two of f of x still
6005920	6007720	does exist.
6007720	6011320	In fact that limit is four.
6011320	6016520	Whatever is the same on both the left and the right side.
6016520	6020800	So the important thing with piecewise functions is we have to be equal to the same number
6020800	6027960	on both sides of the function.
6027960	6031440	With our limit discussion we talked a bit about infinite limits.
6031440	6039760	So let's look at how we can work with infinite limits, calculating them with this whole
6039760	6044200	idea of substitution.
6044200	6056080	With infinite limits there are two properties that will help us calculate the infinite limits.
6056080	6066800	First property is that the limit as x approaches a from the left of one over x minus a.
6066800	6075560	And for coming in from the left on this guide this function will always go to negative infinity.
6075560	6081200	Because all the pieces are positive it's going to go down to negative infinity.
6081200	6088280	Similarly as x approaches a from the right of one over x minus a, coming in from the
6088280	6097240	right we're going to go up to positive infinity.
6097240	6104600	These two limits are going to be the key to finding infinite limits by hand rather than
6104600	6111840	going through the table method or the graph method.
6111840	6122460	Let's first look at the limit as x approaches two from the left of x plus one over x squared
6122460	6128620	minus four.
6128620	6132920	We can't directly plug two in because it makes it undefined so we would start to factor
6132920	6138800	to see if that helps us to see if we can remove the discontinuity.
6138800	6147080	So x plus one over x squared minus four is x plus two times x minus two but the frustrating
6147080	6155480	part there is that x minus two doesn't divide out so we can't divide out the bad part.
6155480	6165360	So what we'll do is we'll isolate the bad part in a separate fraction one over the bad
6165360	6168160	part.
6168160	6176640	This is going to give us the limit as x approaches two from the left of x plus one over x plus
6176640	6187440	two times one over x minus two.
6187440	6197320	Now we can do direct substitution on the good part and for the bad part that's been isolated
6197320	6203240	we're coming in from the left and we know when we come in from the left that's going
6203240	6209280	to go to a negative infinity.
6209280	6211560	So let's look at each of these pieces.
6211560	6224800	In two-in we've got two plus one over two plus two times the negative infinity.
6224800	6236800	Well two plus one is three, two plus two is four times the negative infinity.
6236800	6241120	The answer here is going to be infinity but what we have to decide is we've got a positive
6241120	6248860	times a negative is going to equal a negative and so we end up with this function going
6248860	6254960	out to negative infinity.
6254960	6260320	Let's do that one more time where we isolate the bad part.
6260320	6262040	Let's come in from the other direction.
6262040	6268400	Let's take the limit as x goes to two from the right of the x plus one over x squared
6268400	6270800	minus four.
6270800	6281680	And again we start out the same as x going to two from the right by factoring the denominator
6281680	6291000	to x plus two x minus two and then isolating the bad part as a fraction one over that and
6291000	6299400	so we end up with the limit as x goes to two from the right of x plus one over x plus
6299400	6309280	two times the bad part of one over x minus two.
6309280	6314440	This time we're going in from the plus or positive side that's the second property that's
6314440	6321200	now going to go to a positive infinity.
6321200	6326120	So when we make our substitution step we're going to plug positive infinity in for that
6326120	6328560	second part.
6328560	6337360	Plugging two in we have two plus one over two plus two times positive infinity which is three
6337360	6340920	fourths times positive infinity.
6340920	6346640	A positive times a positive is positive.
6346640	6352520	This graph is going to positive infinity from the right.
6352520	6361040	I have one more limit trick that I want to look at.
6361040	6369040	We call this guy the squeeze theorem and it's particularly useful to find limits with trig
6369040	6374160	properties.
6374160	6384080	The idea with the squeeze theorem is if I've got some function and I don't know what the
6384080	6394760	limit is but I can find a function that goes above it and a function that goes below it
6394760	6400640	so that they all meet in the center at the same exact point.
6400640	6415760	So we've got one that's always above, one that's always below, but they all meet together
6415760	6418160	in the same point.
6418160	6427640	At that same point they will all have the same limit.
6427640	6435120	If they all meet at the same point.
6435120	6439040	My picture doesn't show them meeting at the same point really well but the idea is the
6439040	6444360	top one, the bottom one, and the middle function all converge together at that same point in
6444360	6446000	the center.
6446000	6452680	Then they all have the same exact limit.
6452680	6454920	Let me show you what this looks like.
6454920	6462400	Let's say we want to know the limit as x goes to zero of x squared times the cosine of x.
6462400	6467640	We don't have a limit rule yet that says we can just plug the number into the cosine just
6467640	6475480	into polynomials, into fractions, into multiplication, into radicals, but not into cosine so we need
6475480	6479120	to use the squeeze theorem to get at it.
6479120	6484760	How the squeeze theorem works is we're going to look particularly at the cosine and say
6484760	6492280	one thing we know about the cosine, not the sine, the cosine.
6492280	6496760	The cosine of x has a very bounded domain.
6496760	6501760	It's always between a negative one and a positive one.
6501760	6504840	Same thing for the sine.
6504840	6511760	So what we want to do is manipulate this inequality so that it looks like the entire function
6511760	6516000	x squared times the cosine.
6516000	6520760	Well the center is just missing a multiply by x squared.
6520760	6529040	So if we do that on all three parts, we end up with negative x squared is less than or
6529040	6540520	equal to x squared cosine x, which is less than or equal to x squared.
6540520	6548040	We can take the limit of each of these parts, the limit as x goes to zero of negative x
6548040	6555000	squared is less than or equal to the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x, which
6555000	6560000	is less than or equal to the limit as x goes to zero of x squared.
6560000	6567200	And what's nice about this is the left and the right we can do direct substitution on.
6567200	6574480	If I plug in zero we get negative zero squared, which is just zero, is less than or equal
6574480	6583320	to the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x, which is less than or equal to here
6583320	6585360	we have a polynomial.
6585360	6591660	Direct substitution we plug zero in, zero squared is just zero.
6591660	6599060	So if the limit is less than zero and greater than zero or equal to it must be equal to
6599060	6601980	zero.
6601980	6614020	So the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x is equal to zero because it's been
6614020	6622460	squeezed in between these other two functions that both go to zero.
6622460	6626580	They all are at the same point, they all have the same limit.
6626580	6632180	One is always below and one is always above.
6632180	6634940	So that wraps up our discussion of all of the limit tricks.
6634940	6637340	The basic idea is direct substitution.
6637340	6644700	We want to plug the number that we have for the limit into the function and simplify.
6644700	6649660	We have a couple tricks we did if that doesn't work to get it to a point that it does work.
6649660	6660140	But ultimately if we can plug the number in it's very easy to take the limit.
6660140	6664500	Working with limits leads us directly into an important conversation around the topic
6664500	6666100	of continuity.
6666100	6682820	So we're going to answer the question when is a function continuous?
6682820	6687980	Well in order to determine when the function is or is not continuous we need to know what
6687980	6694700	continuous means.
6694700	6698620	First kind of an informal definition.
6698620	6719420	The idea of continuous means basically I can draw the graph without lifting my pencil.
6719420	6728020	It's just a continuous curve without lifting the pencil for a gap or a jump or an asymptote.
6728020	6731180	It's just continuous.
6731180	6743020	Now a more formal mathematical definition states that a continuous function will satisfy
6743020	6757860	three conditions for all points and we'll call those points A.
6757860	6764900	The first condition is that F of A is defined.
6764900	6769860	So the function can't be undefined at the given point.
6769860	6783460	In addition we need the limit as X approaches A of F of X to exist.
6783460	6788100	So for example if the function is approaching two different numbers from two different sides
6788100	6790820	the limit does not exist.
6790820	6795380	But the all important one that we probably go to to check the most for continuity is
6795380	6805380	that the limit as X approaches A of F of X is actually equal to whatever F of A is.
6805380	6811100	In other words we can do the direct substitution to calculate the limit because the limit is
6811100	6816700	equal to the point itself.
6816700	6822220	These three definitions and specifically this last one being the most important are what
6822220	6827660	makes a function continuous.
6827660	6833020	So what does it mean to be discontinuous or not a continuous function?
6833020	6847420	Well there are actually three types of discontinuity which means not continuous.
6847420	6859300	The first type of discontinuity is what we call a removable discontinuity.
6859300	6862300	And here's what a removable discontinuity looks like.
6862300	6875300	It's something like F of X equals X squared plus X minus 12 over X minus 3.
6875300	6883840	Notice if we tried to calculate F of 3 or just directly substitute the 3 in we would
6883840	6892420	get 3 squared plus 3 minus 12 which is 0 divided by, the important part, 3 minus 3 is 0 and
6892420	6897660	we can't divide by 0.
6897660	6904620	So F of X or F of A, F of 3 is undefined.
6904620	6914340	However if I took my function and I factored it, we'd get what, 4 and 3 plus 4 and minus
6914340	6925660	3 over X minus 3, we can then divide out the X minus 3 and we've removed the discontinuity
6925660	6927780	or the problem.
6927780	6939020	Now because we've been able to remove the discontinuity we could calculate the limit.
6939020	6945540	So this is a removable discontinuity because we were able to algebraically remove the part
6945540	6949540	that was discontinuous.
6949540	6961060	Now the way this looks on a graph, and we'll go ahead and just graph this same function,
6961060	6966980	not to scale here, so we'll come up and call this 4 here.
6966980	6973660	But the idea is this graph is going to go through 4 and it's going to have a hole that's
6973660	6979000	been removed right at 3 that it goes around.
6979000	6986320	We can't graph this without lifting our pencil because we have to lift our pencil at the
6986320	6989840	hole in the graph.
6989840	7000280	So we could say that the hole in the graph is removable.
7000280	7004520	It is a removable discontinuity.
7004520	7009920	The first type of discontinuity.
7009920	7021880	The second type of discontinuity that we're going to look at is called an infinite discontinuity.
7021880	7039400	And the example we're going to use here is f of x is equal to x minus 3 over x plus 1.
7039400	7049500	We would end up with a vertical asymptote at 1.
7049500	7051860	And there's actually also a horizontal asymptote at 1.
7051860	7062820	So this graph looks like this, no it doesn't, it looks like this.
7062820	7083260	But specifically what we find is the infinite discontinuity.
7083260	7088260	So that is our second type of discontinuity.
7088260	7096660	The third type of discontinuity is what we call a jump discontinuity.
7096660	7102020	And it does exactly what you'd expect the graph to do, it jumps.
7102020	7110820	So if we have f of x equals the piecewise function x squared minus 1 for x less than
7110820	7124620	1 and x plus 1 for x greater than or equal to 1, what we're going to find is the limit
7124620	7127260	again is not going to exist.
7127260	7134900	Because if we take the limit as x goes to 1 from the left, or smaller values, we use
7134900	7137500	the first equation.
7137500	7145740	So we'll directly substitute 1 into x squared minus 1, and we get 1 squared minus 1, which
7145740	7147820	is 0.
7147820	7154700	And we compare that to the limit coming in from the right of 1.
7154700	7157100	Well coming in from the right we want the bigger values.
7157100	7164700	So we'll plug it into x plus 1 or 1 plus 1, which is 2.
7164700	7174940	And because these are not the same, we have a jump in the graph.
7174940	7185380	And the limit as x approaches 1 again does not exist.
7185380	7188340	What does this look like as a graph?
7188340	7192340	Looks like you'd expect it to.
7192340	7203820	It's x squared minus 1, so it's going to come down.
7203820	7211140	And then we've got a jump at 1, and then it turns into the line.
7211140	7219300	That's specifically what we're interested in is the graph jumps.
7219300	7225900	So again the whole idea of discontinuity versus continuity is can you draw the graph without
7225900	7227860	lifting your pencil?
7227860	7237820	Specifically does the function at a equal to limit as x approaches a?
7237820	7244100	Kind of a corollary that comes out of this idea of continuity is this idea of what we
7244100	7257260	call the intermediate value theorem, which is often abbreviated with the first letters
7257260	7261980	IVT, intermediate value theorem.
7261980	7273620	And what the intermediate value theorem says is that if a function f of x is continuous,
7273620	7283540	if the function always equals its limit on some interval from a to b, and there's another
7283540	7306820	number z that's between f of a and f of b, then there exists another number, we'll call
7306820	7324100	it c, that is NAB such that f of c will equal that z.
7324100	7325980	Okay that definition is really weird.
7325980	7332220	Let's draw a picture that really illustrates what this means.
7332220	7342620	I've got a graph, we're going to go from a to c, a to b, sorry.
7342620	7346140	So the graph goes from a to b.
7346140	7353300	Say a is down low, b is up high, and it might do something interesting and crazy, but it's
7353300	7360900	continuous so I can draw it without lifting my pencil and go all the way from a to b.
7360900	7368420	Well a hits at f of a and b hits up on top at f of b.
7368420	7376620	The idea of the intermediate value theorem is I can pick any z that is between f of a
7376620	7382820	and f of b, any z I want.
7382820	7398940	And wherever I pick that z, there is a guarantee that there will be a solution, some c that
7398940	7403020	will get me that solution.
7403020	7409340	In fact there could be more than one solution, if I pick a z kind of down towards the center
7409340	7413140	you see there's three solutions in there.
7413140	7422900	But there's always at least one solution for any z that's in the middle of those.
7422900	7428140	Basically we're going to hit every single value all the way up from f of a to f of b
7428140	7433500	because there's no other way to connect the dots.
7433500	7441700	Now there's a couple of cautions about what this theorem actually says.
7441700	7448780	So before we get to an example of how to use it, I want to make sure we clearly understand
7448780	7453460	what this is actually saying.
7453460	7460060	First the definition started out that if f is continuous.
7460060	7477700	This does not work if f is not continuous.
7477700	7483580	But it could.
7483580	7488740	We just don't have the guarantee that we get from continuity.
7488740	7493100	So drawing a picture of what I mean by that.
7493100	7498020	Here we've got a, here we've got b.
7498020	7502860	So there's a point at a and there's a point at b.
7502860	7507640	So we've got f of b and f of a.
7507640	7513100	The intermediate value theorem says that I can pick any z in between f of a and f of
7513100	7517820	b, as long as it's continuous.
7517820	7528620	But if this function just kind of goes like this, and then there's a jump discontinuity
7528620	7537040	and it goes like that, notice if I pick a z right in the middle of that jump discontinuity
7537040	7541180	I do not get a solution.
7541180	7546460	I could if I picked a z up high enough that it actually hit the graph.
7546460	7554140	I could get a result, but I'm not guaranteed a result because of that jump discontinuity.
7554140	7563020	So it does not work if f is not continuous.
7563020	7587980	The other important thing is it does not work if z is outside of f of a and f of b.
7587980	7591940	But it could.
7591940	7593180	Again it could work.
7593180	7598500	We just don't have that guarantee.
7598500	7608860	So again we're going to go from a to b, a's here, b's here, which means f of a is at the
7608860	7615300	lower point where a is, f of b at the higher point.
7615300	7626900	And if f of a is connected somehow, but my z is too low or too high, I'm not guaranteed
7626900	7630980	that it's going to work, that I'm going to cross the graph.
7630980	7635280	It doesn't necessarily mean no though because if the graph did go up and down and really
7635280	7639860	wiggle it could go down and hit z.
7639860	7643940	But I don't have any guarantee that it does.
7643940	7650220	So it's really important for the intermediate value theorem that z has to be between the
7650220	7657220	two y values.
7657220	7680800	The one other thing this tells us, this theorem only tells us there is at least one solution.
7680800	7690500	There may or may not be more.
7690500	7698380	And I kind of hinted at this with my original drawing.
7698380	7707180	But again we've got a and we've got b, put a down low and b up high and the graph is
7707180	7718640	going to wiggle, but specifically f of a aligns with a and f of b aligns with b.
7718640	7726120	And if I pick z in the middle of this graph, what you'll see is I actually get one, two,
7726120	7727240	three solutions.
7727240	7735040	So there's actually three points that work that could be our c.
7735040	7740420	We are guaranteed with the intermediate value theorem that there is at least one solution
7740420	7743020	for z.
7743020	7754560	There could be more, but we have no way of knowing if there is or is not more.
7754560	7764940	So that's really what this intermediate value theorem is trying to say is if f of x is continuous
7764940	7774640	and our z is somewhere between those y values of f of a and f of b, then there exists at
7774640	7786600	least one c such that when we plug c into the function we get z for a solution.
7786600	7791680	How do we use this?
7791680	7793400	Well here's how we use this.
7793400	7804660	We use this to show that we do have solutions to functions even if we can't solve them.
7804660	7828820	We can show that zero equals one over x plus sine x has at least one solution.
7828820	7834040	We know this function is continuous except at zero.
7834040	7842700	So we're going to stay away from zero so that we're continuous between our a and our b.
7842700	7849580	In order to show that it has one solution, what we're going to attempt to do, a solution
7849580	7855100	happens at zero it says, what we're going to attempt to do is find the point where the
7855100	7858400	graph crosses zero.
7858400	7865600	Notice before zero the graph is negative.
7865600	7873480	After zero this graph is positive.
7873480	7878680	Zero is going to be between negative and positive.
7878680	7888180	So if I can show that there is a solution that's negative and that this guy has a solution
7888180	7897380	that's positive, everything between it including zero must exist.
7897380	7904820	One thing we know about sine is where is sine positive?
7904820	7908420	We're going to add sine of x.
7908800	7915160	Sine is the y-coordinate on the unit circle, so I imagine my unit circle.
7915160	7922800	The y-coordinate is positive, so let's make a note of what we're doing here.
7923300	7946780	We need to find a negative and positive solution or better than saying solution let's say output
7946780	7959360	four f of x and then zero between it must exist as an output.
7959360	7964440	So on the unit circle sine, sine is the y-coordinate.
7964440	7971600	The y-coordinate I notice is very positive up here on top, that's at pi over two and
7971600	7979260	it's also very negative down here at the bottom at three pi over two.
7979260	7984620	Let's see what those give us when we plug them in.
7984620	7992900	So let's find f of pi over two which is equal to one over pi over two plus the sine of pi
7992900	7998220	over two.
7998220	8005480	One over pi over two that's the reciprocal, so we have two over pi plus the sine of pi
8005480	8008720	over two is one.
8008720	8017640	That's definitely positive, actually if I put it in my calculator I get 1.64 or so.
8017640	8021720	Then the other point to try and get negative, we said the most negative point for sine is
8021720	8024320	at three pi over two.
8024320	8027400	So let's see what that gives us.
8027400	8040860	One over three pi over two plus the sine of three pi over two is equal to one of the reciprocal
8040860	8051260	of three pi over two is two over three pi plus the sine of three pi over two is negative
8051260	8053060	one.
8053200	8061400	Sure enough that's negative point seven eight eight.
8061400	8066800	Therefore, by the way these three triangles, these three dots in a triangle that means
8066800	8073320	therefore, it's a nice shorthand for mathematicians.
8073320	8090420	Therefore we know that all outputs between 1.64 and negative point seven eight eight are
8090420	8096020	possible.
8096020	8117760	Probably they're possible when x is between three pi over two and pi over two.
8117760	8131520	Therefore zero, which is between those values, is a solution.
8131520	8137340	The intermediate value theorem tells us that there has to be a result in output between
8137340	8144140	1.64 and negative point seven eight eight.
8145140	8154040	Therefore zero is a solution.
8154040	8157740	That's a quick look at continuity and the intermediate value theorem.
8157740	8161480	Take a look at some of the problems in your book to practice this a bit, but I'll look
8161480	8169580	forward to seeing you in class so we can talk about continuity a little bit more.
8169580	8173960	Thus far in our studies of limit, we have kind of been waving our hands over the definition
8173960	8179620	of a limit and talking more generally about the definition rather than the precise definition.
8179620	8181820	That's what we're going to take a look at today.
8181820	8198460	The question is what is the precise definition of a limit?
8198460	8209680	First we're going to look at the definition and then we'll take a look at the meat of
8209680	8215120	this lesson, which is how do we show that a value actually is the limit of some type
8215120	8217120	of function.
8217120	8225000	First graphically to get an idea of what we're going to be talking about here, let's say
8225000	8236860	we've got some graph, maybe it curves up like this.
8236860	8248540	We want to know what is the limit of f of x as x approaches some number, actually let's
8248540	8257760	call it a not c as x approaches a of f of x.
8257760	8265400	The way we actually define the derivative is we're going to move from a out a little
8265400	8270120	bit each direction because remember our limit, we need both sides.
8270120	8275420	That little tiny change that we move, we call delta.
8275420	8285140	We add delta and we subtract delta to get to two more spots.
8285140	8297060	The idea is if I go up to the point on the graph, what I can do is I can box in the actual
8297060	8305600	point on the graph within that range.
8305600	8309960	The point on the graph in green here where a actually hits or where a should be, it might
8309960	8310960	not actually be there.
8310960	8314360	We're going to call that l the limit.
8314360	8325120	The idea is that the deltas will box it in within some epsilon above or epsilon below.
8325120	8329860	The challenge that we're going to have is to find the connection between the delta that
8329860	8336900	we move left and right on the bottom and the epsilon that we move up and down from the
8336900	8339260	right.
8339260	8344740	The idea is if we zoom in and zoom in and zoom in and get closer and closer to the actual
8344740	8350420	point, we'll continue to be boxed in around some epsilon.
8350420	8353620	That box is what allows us to not actually have a point there because we just have to
8353620	8355360	be around the point.
8355360	8360760	Basically infinitely close to the point but not actually at the point, what are we at?
8360760	8366840	For every epsilon, we need to be able to find a delta.
8366840	8375920	This is what gives rise to, in words, the precise definition for the limit.
8375920	8389180	We say that for all epsilon, greater than zero, that there exists a delta greater than
8389180	8404300	zero, another Greek letter, such that if the absolute value of x minus a is less than delta,
8404600	8413000	remember a is that x-coordinate that we want to find the limit at, then the absolute value,
8413000	8418520	we do absolute value because we can do plus or minus, the absolute value of f of x minus
8418520	8425520	l is less than epsilon.
8425520	8435580	In other words, on the right side, we're within an epsilon of the actual limit.
8435580	8440060	Because mathematicians like to show off and make things more complicated than they really
8440060	8450500	are, we actually can represent this entire definition symbolically.
8450500	8455800	This is a neat party trick is to just be able to write down really quick the precise definition
8455800	8459120	of a limit without writing a single word.
8459120	8462000	Here is symbolically the precise definition of a limit.
8462000	8463400	This is a thing of beauty.
8463400	8474640	The limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l implies that for all epsilon greater than
8474640	8482100	zero, there exists a delta greater than zero such that the absolute value of x minus a
8482100	8491400	is less than delta implies that the absolute value of f of x minus the limit is less than
8491400	8495900	epsilon.
8495900	8502820	So a great party trick is the precise definition of a limit.
8502820	8513160	I enjoy putting this on the test for extra credit, but it is quite fancy looking.
8513160	8516920	What we really want to be able to do with this definition, though, is actually be able
8516920	8521800	to take a limit and say, hey, if this is the limit, I can prove it's actually the limit
8521800	8526400	by identifying this relationship between epsilon and delta.
8526400	8532820	We call these our epsilon delta proofs, and every single proof looks identical.
8532820	8544340	And so to help you set up your proofs, I'm going to show you the structure of the proof
8544340	8552020	that the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l.
8552020	8556760	We're going to do four steps, and three of the four steps are really scripted, and the
8556760	8561720	fourth one is just a little bit of algebra that's actually quite easy.
8561720	8569920	The first step is you're always going to say, we let epsilon be greater than zero.
8569920	8572760	That has to be true, and that's always the same.
8572760	8575280	Every proof, let epsilon be greater than zero.
8575280	8583900	Then you'll say, choose a delta that is equal to something, and actually we're going to
8583900	8586900	find this later.
8586900	8598420	I should do that in a different color because it's not actually part of the proof.
8598420	8601620	Usually that something is going to have the epsilon in it because it's going to show the
8601620	8604500	relationship between epsilon and delta.
8604500	8610880	Just leave it blank temporarily because the next thing you do is you assume the absolute
8610880	8620960	value of x minus a is less than the delta.
8620960	8629600	Then you say the absolute value of f of x minus the limit is equal to, and then you
8629600	8637700	do some algebra.
8637700	8644360	After some algebra, you're going to ultimately say that's less than something, which is going
8644360	8652520	to require you to do some more algebra.
8652520	8655520	That will ultimately equal epsilon.
8655520	8660320	Move that arrow so it's a little nicer.
8660320	8666760	Maybe make it blue.
8666760	8669560	Every single proof is going to look exactly the same.
8669560	8673920	The only place where you actually have to do any work is in this dot, dot, dot.
8673920	8678840	While you do that dot, dot, dot of algebra, it's going to tell you what you're ultimately
8678840	8685000	going to put in back in step number two for that delta.
8685000	8688320	Three steps one, two, and three, we usually throw out on one line because they are so
8688320	8690720	straightforward.
8690720	8691720	Let's do a couple examples.
8691720	8695520	I've got four examples of proofs, and then you can practice some on your own.
8695520	8702560	First let's do some linear examples.
8702560	8708200	Just kind of as a tip, if we're dealing with a linear equation like y equals mx plus b,
8708200	8716040	with linear examples, the delta is generally equal to epsilon divided by something.
8716040	8722280	You have to figure out what that something is.
8722280	8731920	Following that same structure, first we're going to prove that the limit as x approaches
8731920	8739800	three of four x minus seven equals five.
8739800	8751440	Notice that three is the a, what x is approaching, five is the limit or l, and the four x minus
8751440	8755560	seven, that's the function.
8755560	8758200	So here's our proof.
8758200	8763680	We always say let epsilon be greater than zero.
8763680	8775880	Choose a delta that's equal to something, we'll leave that blank, and then we will assume
8775880	8785520	the absolute value of x minus a, a is what the limit is approaching, is less than delta.
8785520	8789880	That part's really scripted, the only gap is we don't know what delta equals yet.
8789880	8793240	We're going to go back and fill that in in a minute.
8793240	8798960	Now we're going to take the absolute value of f of x minus l, let's put f of x in there
8798960	8804880	actually, f of x is the function, four x minus seven, and then subtract the limit, which
8804880	8812400	is five, and now we're going to play with this and do some algebra.
8812400	8816280	What you might see immediately is we can combine like terms on the seven and the five, so we
8816280	8824720	have the absolute value of four x minus twelve, and then what we ultimately want to do is
8824720	8831400	we want to find some absolute value of x minus three, so we can use what we assumed.
8831400	8836120	What you might see here is all we have to do is factor out the four, and we get the
8836120	8841520	absolute value of x minus three.
8841520	8849800	We know that the absolute value of x minus three is less than delta, so we're ready
8849800	8854160	to do our less than statement.
8854160	8865840	It's less than four times the absolute value, which is less than delta.
8865840	8873120	This is where we know now what we want delta to be, because what we ultimately want to
8873120	8881560	do is when we multiply by four, all that's left is epsilon, so delta then is going to
8881560	8885440	be the reciprocal of what we're multiplying by.
8885440	8894500	The reciprocal of four is one over four, so delta is equal to epsilon over four, and we
8894500	8898260	stick that into the first line.
8898260	8902740	That might not be very clear, but it becomes clear why that's useful in the very next step,
8902740	8910220	because now we have four times delta is equal to epsilon over four, and now the fours divide
8910220	8916620	out leaving just the epsilon.
8916620	8928100	If we're able to simplify the f of x minus l and say it is less than epsilon, we have
8928100	8936300	proven that this limit is actually equal to what we said it was equal to.
8936300	8940980	When we're done with the proof, there's a couple ways we show that we're done in mathematics.
8940980	8946580	The most common way is we write at the end QED.
8946580	8951740	That's Latin for queterum dimestratum, that was what we wished to show.
8951740	8955940	Another thing I see a lot of times is people put a little box and color it in, as if to
8955940	8959220	check off that it's done.
8959220	8967940	Another thing I've seen is W to the fifth, which stands for which was what we wanted.
8967940	8971860	Now acknowledge though that you've gotten to the end of the proof, QED is really nice
8971860	8976580	because it looks like you know Latin and it looks smart.
8976580	8980540	Let's do one more linear example so that we can see kind of how another similar problem
8980540	8985260	works, but every problem kind of has the same general setup.
8985260	8995140	For this example we're going to prove that the limit as x goes to negative one of x squared
8995140	9005180	plus four x plus three over x plus one is equal to two.
9005180	9010500	Like before, identifying the pieces, what x is approaching, that's my A, what's inside
9010500	9017540	the limit, that's the function, and the answer, that's my limit L.
9017540	9021260	The first line is pretty scripted of every delta epsilon proof.
9021260	9024600	We let epsilon be greater than zero.
9024600	9030360	We choose a delta that's equal to something, leave some space, we'll come back, it's going
9030360	9038160	to be the reciprocal of whatever we're multiplying delta by with an epsilon in the numerator.
9038160	9044440	Then we will assume the absolute value of x minus A, which is negative one, minus the
9044440	9055160	negative ones, the same as plus one, is less than delta.
9055160	9057880	Now the next line is where we do our algebra.
9057880	9063040	We take the absolute value of the function, which is x squared plus four x plus three
9063040	9070080	over x plus one, and subtract the limit of two, and hopefully after massaging it a bit
9070160	9075720	we end up saying this is less than epsilon.
9075720	9079720	With rational expressions, we're really comfortable with factoring to reduce, so when we factor
9079720	9086080	we get x plus three times x plus one over the x plus one, and we still have the minus
9086080	9089920	two at the end.
9089920	9096400	This is really nice because the x plus ones divide out, which leaves us with the absolute
9096400	9102360	value of x plus three minus two.
9102360	9108040	I'm going to run out of space on my next statement, so let's go ahead and use the next line and
9108040	9115040	say equals the absolute value combining like terms of x plus one.
9117960	9122760	This is actually really nice because this already is the part that's less than delta.
9122760	9125960	This time we don't have to factor anything out.
9126000	9129800	Just to keep things consistent though, I'm going to factor out a one, and say that's
9129800	9136800	one times the absolute value, because we know that delta has to be the reciprocal of that
9138960	9141600	number times epsilon.
9141600	9148100	The reciprocal of one is just one, so we have epsilon over one, or just epsilon.
9148100	9155100	Delta equals epsilon, because now I know that the x plus one is less than one.
9156560	9162440	That's from my assume statement.
9162440	9169440	X plus one is less than the delta, and we know that the delta is equal to the epsilon,
9170200	9177200	which is what we defined at the beginning, and QED, we have proven that this limit equals
9179880	9183440	two.
9183720	9188400	Linear examples, our general strategy as we work through the steps is to make delta equal
9188400	9195400	to the reciprocal of whatever is multiplied by delta.
9195400	9200160	But we can also do quadratic examples pretty nicely.
9200160	9207160	Let's do a couple of those quadratic examples.
9214220	9219880	With quadratics, what we're going to have to do is we're going to need a little bit
9219880	9225640	of help to make delta come out right, and so we're going to actually give delta two
9225640	9227360	options.
9227360	9234360	Delta is always going to be equal to the minimum of one, and epsilon divided by something.
9238840	9243080	We need that one to kind of set up what the divided by something is, and I'll show you
9243120	9247120	in just a minute, but with quadratics, when you see x squared, delta is going to be the
9247120	9254120	minimum of one and the reciprocal, again, of what's being multiplied by delta.
9256320	9263320	So let's see if we can prove that the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus three
9264320	9271320	x is equal to negative two.
9275080	9282080	Again, x is approaching our a value, the function is what's inside the limit, and l, the limit
9282360	9289360	is the answer, and we start filling in our proof structure.
9290360	9297360	First we let epsilon be greater than zero, then we choose a delta that's going to be
9301200	9305840	equal to something we don't know yet, but we know with quadratics we have to do the
9305840	9310400	minimum of one and something.
9310400	9317400	We don't know what the something is yet, and then we will assume that the absolute value
9318160	9325160	of x minus two, or our a that x is approaching, is less than delta.
9333020	9336120	Then we go to that absolute value statement.
9336120	9342480	The absolute value of our function, x squared minus three x, minus the limit, minus the
9342480	9347680	negative two, means plus two, and hopefully we'll work this down and ultimately say it's
9347680	9352640	less than an epsilon.
9352640	9356840	With quadratics we're probably very familiar with factoring.
9356840	9361680	With absolute value we just keep the absolute values around each factor, so x squared is
9361680	9368680	x times x, and if we do a minus two and a minus one, we're completely factored.
9369520	9376520	What's nice here is that we've got the x minus two that we know is less than delta.
9377960	9383040	So we're going to be able to say this is less than something times delta, but we need to
9383040	9390040	know what to do with the x minus one bit.
9391720	9396240	This is where it's going to take a little creativeness.
9396240	9402600	How we're going to get to that creativeness is we're going to play with the algebra on
9402600	9409600	x minus two is less than delta, and the fact that we said delta's going to be at most one.
9410160	9416360	It's the minimum of one and something else.
9416360	9422120	Let's see, we're going to play off to the side here, I guess I'll put it underneath.
9422120	9429120	The absolute value of x minus two is less than delta, but delta's no bigger than one.
9431760	9435840	If the absolute value is less than a number, what that really means is that the x minus
9435840	9442840	two is between negative one and positive one.
9444400	9449640	We want to know what to do with the x minus one, so we're going to try and change this
9449680	9456680	middle stuff to become x minus one. To get x minus two to become x minus one, we're going
9457280	9464280	to add one. Of course, if we add one there, we have to add one to all three parts. When
9464400	9471400	we do, we get zero is less than x minus one, which is less than two.
9471400	9478400	Now, we're going to change this back to an absolute value statement that the absolute
9480000	9487000	value of x minus one is less than something. We can either say the absolute value is less
9487000	9494000	than zero or less than two. We always will take the most extreme value because we want
9494200	9499240	to be less than. We want to keep epsilon as small as possible, so we'll take the worst
9499240	9505520	case scenario and say, worst case scenario, the two is more extreme. The worst case scenario,
9505520	9512520	the absolute value of x minus one is less than two. That is what we're going to multiply
9514880	9521880	delta by. x minus one, worst case scenario is two. x minus two, worst case scenario is
9522880	9529880	delta. At least, we know that the absolute value of x minus two times x minus one is
9533960	9540960	less than two times delta. Now, we know what to do with the epsilon. Epsilon divided by
9543760	9549760	two, the reciprocal of the two, because it's multiplied by delta, to make the rest of the
9549920	9555760	proof work. We have two times delta, which is epsilon over two. Two's divide out and
9555760	9562760	we're just left with epsilon. We're done because we've said that the function minus
9565520	9572520	the limit is less than epsilon. We can now say we're done. QED. I'm probably pronouncing
9572520	9579520	that wrong, but you don't know Latin, so you can't prove me wrong. Let's do one more quadratic
9585160	9590360	because these take a little bit more trying to manipulate that second factor in order
9590360	9597360	to figure out what our delta is going to equal. Let's prove that the limit as x approaches
9598360	9605360	negative one of two x squared minus x plus one is equal to four. Again, identifying the
9615760	9622760	pieces, x is approaching our A. The function is what we're taking the limit of and the
9623160	9630160	answer that is L, our limit. The first three statements of our proof are pretty prescribed
9631560	9638560	to us. Let epsilon be greater than zero. We will choose a delta that's equal to, we don't
9641800	9645840	know exactly what it equals yet, but we do know because this is a quadratic, we're going
9645840	9652840	to do the minimum of one and something, the reciprocal of whatever delta is multiplied
9653600	9660600	by. Then we assume the absolute value of x minus our A, or what x is approaching, minus
9666680	9673680	negative one means plus one is less than delta. Now, our algebraic statement is that the
9675840	9682840	step, the function, two x squared minus x plus one minus the limit of four, a little
9685760	9692760	bit of cleanup, the absolute value of two x squared minus x minus three. Hopefully,
9695600	9702600	we can work with this and say it is ultimately less than epsilon. Well, we know we can factor
9703320	9710320	it, two x and x. To kind of help my factoring, I know I'm ultimately going to try and get
9714280	9720080	an x plus one. Hopefully, that x is an x plus one, which means the other one is probably
9720080	9726080	a minus three. When I check that out, it does work. Plus two minus three is the minus one.
9726520	9732800	Nice, that's what we wanted. Now, we have the x plus one that we like. We know that's
9732800	9739800	less than delta, but we have to figure out what delta is multiplied by. We need to play
9740560	9747560	with the two x minus three. Using what we assume, so kind of off to the side in our
9747640	9754640	work, we assumed, going back to that assumption statement, we assume that x plus one is less
9754800	9761800	than delta, which worst case scenario, it's going to be a one, the absolute value. We
9763040	9769880	remove the absolute values by saying that's between positive one and negative one. Then,
9769880	9776380	we want to massage this so that it looks like two x minus three, so we can figure out how
9776380	9783380	extreme our situation is. I recommend doing the two x part first. We get it to equal
9785080	9792080	two x by multiplying by two on all three parts. Make sure we distribute, so we get negative
9792440	9799440	two is less than two x plus two, which is less than two. Bias number white board space.
9804000	9809880	We want it to have a minus three, two x minus three. Right now, it's plus two. To get that
9809880	9814880	to be minus three, we need to subtract five. Two minus five will be the minus three. We
9814880	9821880	subtract five from all three parts, and we get negative seven is less than two x minus
9821880	9828880	three, which is less than negative three. Changing it back to an absolute value expression, two
9832160	9839160	x minus three is less than, and then we pick the most extreme case, so we're always ready
9839160	9843920	for a worst case scenario. This time, the most extreme case is on the right side, seven
9843920	9850920	being more extreme than the three, and positive because we're talking about absolute value.
9851720	9858720	So two x minus three is less than seven. That is what is being multiplied by our delta,
9861440	9868440	which also tells us the reciprocal means divide by seven, so our delta is epsilon over seven.
9870080	9876920	So we have seven times delta, which is epsilon over seven. The sevens divide out, and we're
9876920	9883920	just left with epsilon. So we've shown that f of x minus l is less than epsilon, which
9890240	9897240	QED is what we wanted, that which was to be demonstrated.
9900160	9907160	So that is your general proof for limit. We're just going to work with linear examples
9909640	9914440	and quadratic examples. In this class, you can take more advanced classes if you really
9914440	9919760	want to prove a whole bunch of delta epsilons, but you should be very familiar with how to
9919760	9926240	set up the proof. Always let epsilon be greater than zero. Choose a delta equal to something,
9926240	9931800	and then assume that x minus a is less than delta, and then ultimately we play with f
9931800	9938800	of x minus l, that f of x minus l is less than epsilon, and if you do that, you've got
9941360	9947600	a perfect delta epsilon proof. Practice a few of these. We will see you in class where
9947600	9954280	we can talk more about these proofs in more detail.
9954280	9958240	Number three is going to be all about the derivatives. So to start off, we really need
9958240	9964000	to know what is the derivative. Specifically, when we say the derivative, what we're talking
9964000	9971000	about is the slope of a tangent line to a function. So the question we're going to answer
9971240	9978240	is how do we find the slope of a tangent line?
9985280	9993000	And really, to answer this question, when we want the slope of a tangent line through
9993000	9999840	a specific point, there are two methods. Both work equally well. Sometimes one is better
9999840	10006840	than the other to find the slope of a tangent line.
10015280	10020680	Also, by way of vocabulary, when we say the slope of a tangent line, what we're talking
10020680	10027680	about is what is called in calculus the derivative, the rate of change instantaneously at that
10029280	10036840	point. So the first method we're going to look at, kind of to set it up graphically,
10036840	10043840	say we've got some curve going on here, and we've got some point that we want to look
10044280	10048200	at. We want to know what is the slope, what is the rate of change of the tangent line at
10048200	10055200	that point. So if I go up from a, we get a point on the line, and that is at f of a.
10056920	10061120	Well to get a slope, we need a second point that we can calculate it off of. So we'll
10061120	10068120	go off to the right here, and we'll pick some other random x, which has a point on the line
10068960	10075960	and some f of x solution to that. So the coordinates of that second point in red are x, f of x,
10079360	10086360	and the coordinates of the point in green are a, f of a. And the tangent line is the
10087000	10093840	line that connects those two dots. Actually that's a secant line. But the way we make
10093840	10099120	that secant line, actually let's first talk about the secant line. What is the slope of
10099120	10106120	the secant line? Well to get the slope of the secant line, it's just the slope of the
10107000	10111520	slope formula that we know already, y2 minus y1, and then we divide it by subtract the
10111520	10118520	x's. So for the slope of the secant line, that's going to be f of x minus f of a, subtracting
10119520	10126520	the y's, divided by x minus a, subtracting the x coordinates. And the way we make that
10129280	10136280	secant line into a tangent line is we take x and move it closer and closer to a. We move
10136280	10143280	x to a, and then that line is going to become less secant and more tangent. Well we know
10144280	10151280	how to express that, that the slope of the tangent line then is the limit as x approaches
10151560	10158560	a of that same function, f of x minus f of a, all over x minus a. So that is our first
10165760	10171320	possible formula. It's going to be an important one for us for how to find the slope of the
10171320	10178080	tangent line. There is a second way that's used quite often, and in fact we'll probably
10178080	10185080	use it more often overall in the course, that is similar to what we just did. So again,
10188600	10195600	we'll make our little graph, and we've got some curve going on. And we'll have some
10195600	10202600	a, which goes up to a point at f of a. But instead of going over to some x randomly,
10208360	10214320	we're going to increase what we call h. So we end up with a point over here that's a
10214320	10221320	plus h. And actually let me do that in red. A plus h. And so the a plus h gets this point
10222040	10229040	up here, and so what we actually end up with is f of a plus h. So if we want the slope
10237540	10244540	of the secant line that connects these two together, just like before, the slope of the
10245040	10249960	secant line is going to be equal to the difference in the y's divided by the difference in the
10249960	10255560	x's. Let's go ahead and label that. This red point, the x coordinate is a plus h, and
10255560	10262560	the y coordinate is f of a plus h. And then the green point is a comma f of a again. So
10266760	10273760	for the slope, subtract the y's, f of a plus h, minus f of a, all over the x coordinates
10274120	10281120	a plus h, minus a, which is nice because the a's actually subtract out to zero. So we really
10285320	10292320	have is f of a plus h, minus f of a, all over h. And the way we make this slope into a,
10292320	10299320	or the secant line into a tangent line, is we say we want that h, the amount we move
10304240	10311240	over to be basically zero. So we make the h go to zero. Or we say that the slope of the
10311240	10318240	tangent line is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of that function, f of a plus h, minus
10329360	10336360	f of a, all over h. And that is the second way we can find the derivative at a point.
10337360	10343240	And both of these functions are going to give us the same answer, but it's two ways to
10343240	10350240	get at that same value. And sometimes one way will be easier than another way. So what
10351200	10355240	we're going to do is we're going to work through three examples where we calculate the slope
10355240	10360280	of the tangent line, and also the equation of the tangent line while we're at it. But
10360280	10365120	we're going to solve it both ways so we can kind of compare how the two formulas work
10365160	10372160	together. So our first example that we're going to do is a polynomial. First we're going
10375120	10379680	to find the slope, and then we'll find the equation of the tangent line. Our polynomial
10379680	10386680	is f of x equals x squared minus 3x. And we're going to find the slope of the tangent
10387680	10394680	line at x equals 1. The first thing we need to know is what's the y-coordinate that we're
10396680	10403680	working with. So f of 1 is equal to 1 squared minus 3 times 1, which is 1 minus 3 or negative
10405680	10412680	2. So we're really working with 1 comma negative 2 as our point.
10417460	10422880	So using our first formula to solve for the slope of the tangent line, we know that the
10422880	10429880	slope is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a all over x minus
10430080	10437080	a. Plugging in what we have then, we've got the limit as x this time is going to 1. Of
10438600	10445600	f of x, which is x squared minus 3x, subtract the f of a, which is what we just found, f
10446680	10453000	of 1 is negative 2, so subtracting negative 2 is the same as adding 2, all over x minus
10453000	10460000	the 1. What we see here is we can't do direct substitution
10460000	10464360	because if we do, we divide by 0. But we worked with this problem a lot with limits in our
10464360	10470860	previous unit, so we know we need to factor that numerator. It's going to be x minus 2
10470860	10477860	times x minus 1 over the x minus 1. And when we do that, the x minus 1's can divide out.
10479500	10486340	And now that we've removed that discontinuity, we can plug into our function the limit value
10486340	10493340	of 1. So x minus 2 becomes 1 minus 2, which means we have a slope of negative 1. Now,
10493340	10500340	I did say there were two definitions. Remember, the second definition would be as we took
10505900	10512900	the limit as h goes to 0 of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h. So we have the limit
10513680	10520680	as h goes to 0 of f of a plus h. Remember, a in this case is 1, so that really means
10528080	10535080	1 plus h. So x squared becomes 1 plus h squared minus 3x, which is 1 plus h. And then we
10536080	10543080	subtract f of a, which we've already figured out in blue up above, is negative 2. So minus
10543080	10550580	negative 2 means plus 2 all over h. Multiplying out the pieces here, we've got the limit as
10550580	10557580	h goes to 0. Squaring it, we get 1 plus 2h plus h squared minus 3 minus 3h plus 2. And
10566080	10573080	all over h. What's nice here is if we do the 1 minus 3 plus 2, 1 plus 2 is 3 minus 3
10577000	10584000	is 0. So now, we've got 2, or the limit, as h goes to 0 of 2h plus h squared minus 3
10595200	10602200	h all over h. Every single term there has an h in it that we can factor out to remove
10603760	10610760	our discontinuity. H times 2 plus h minus 3 all over h. I probably could have combined
10614400	10621400	the 2 and 3, wouldn't matter. But ultimately, those h's divide out, and now we can plug
10622120	10629120	in the 0 for h. So we have 2 plus 0 minus 3, which is negative 1. We get the same slope
10635680	10642680	of the tangent line. The slope at 1 is negative 1. Now that we know the slope, we can find
10642800	10649800	the equation. Remember, the equation is y equals m times x minus 1. Now that we know
10651680	10658680	minus x1 plus y1. So plugging in the pieces, y equals the slope of negative 1 times x minus
10661040	10668040	the x-coordinate is 1, and the y-coordinate is negative 2. We have the equation of our
10668640	10675640	tangent line. Let's try another example where we work through both of the formulas. Let's
10675640	10682640	do a fraction. Let's say f of x is equal to 3 over x plus 1, and we want the slope of
10694040	10701040	the tangent line at x equals 2. Well, first we need to know what the y-coordinate is at
10701640	10708640	2. So we'll find f of a, or f of 2, remember that's the a, is equal to 3 over 2 plus 1,
10716240	10723240	and 3 over 3 is just equal to 1. So we have the point x is 2, y is 1, or a is 2, and
10723800	10730800	f of a is 1. We had two formulas to find the derivative, or the slope of the tangent line
10733800	10738400	at 2. Both of them work, give you the same answer. We're going to do both just so that
10738400	10744900	we can see it worked out both ways. The first is the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus
10745200	10752200	f of a, all over x minus a. So for this function, we're doing the limit as x minus x minus x
10753320	10760320	approaches 2 this time of the function, 3 over x plus 1, minus f of a. We've already found
10762280	10769280	out that f of a is equal to 1, all over x minus the a, which is 2. What we see here is we've
10772720	10777700	got a complex fraction inside a limit, but we've seen this before. We know we can get
10777700	10784700	rid of that by multiplying by the x plus 1, distributing it through on top and bottom.
10788660	10792980	And when we do, be careful with that negative sign. The x plus 1's are gone, and we get
10792980	10799980	the limit as x goes to 2 of 3 minus 1x minus 1, all over x minus 2 times x plus 1.
10808220	10815220	The limit as x goes to 2 of 2 minus x over x minus 2 times x plus 1. And we know 2 minus
10820620	10825420	x and x minus 2 can divide out as long as there's a negative 1 left over, because the
10825420	10831420	subtraction's in the wrong order. And now that we've removed that discontinuity, we
10831420	10836700	can do direct substitution and plug 2 into the fraction. So we have negative 1 over x,
10836700	10843700	which is 2 plus 1, and this gives us negative 1 third for our slope. The slope at 2 is
10847620	10854620	negative 1 third. Let's try and work that out again, this time using our second definition
10857860	10863860	of the derivative at a point, and that's the one where we take the limit as h goes to 0
10863860	10870860	of f of a plus h minus f of a, all over h. So the limit as h goes to 0 of, this time we're
10877140	10884140	going to take a plus h, a is 2, because we're at 2, so 2 plus h, of 3 over x, which is 2
10886620	10893620	plus h plus 1 minus the f of the a. We can do direct substitution and plug 2 into the
10893860	10900860	numerator. We know that's 1, all over x, or all over h. The simplifying step is going
10903420	10907580	to feel almost exactly the same. We need to get rid of that denominator, so we're going
10907580	10914580	to multiply by 2 plus h plus 1 all the way across the numerator and the denominator.
10917340	10922540	We're going to leave the denominator factored, however, because that's going to reduce out
10922540	10929120	the h in just a minute. First fraction, we're just left with 3 minus, distribute the negative
10929120	10936120	one through, minus 2, minus h, minus 1, all over h, don't forget the limit as h goes
10938620	10945620	to 0, all over h times 2 plus h plus 1, and we could have combined the 2 and the 1 if
10945620	10952620	we wanted to. It's not going to make much difference. What's nice now, though, is if
10953860	10960860	we do 3 minus 2 minus 1, that's completely gone. Why don't we do that simplifying? We
10962460	10969460	have the limit as h goes to 0 of negative h over h times 2 plus 1 is 3 plus h. We notice
10969460	10976460	those h's are gone. We've removed the discontinuity, and so we're able to just plug 0 in. We have
10981540	10988540	negative 1 over 3 plus 0, which is negative 1 third.
10988540	10995540	Same answer both times, so I'm feeling pretty confident going into my equation of the tangent
11003380	11010380	line here. The equation is y equals my slope, negative 1 third times x minus the x coordinate,
11011220	11018220	minus the x coordinate, which is 2, plus the y coordinate, which is 1. The equation of
11018220	11025380	the tangent line to 3 over x plus 1 at x equals 2 is y equals negative 1 third times x minus
11025380	11032860	2 plus 1. One more example that I want to work through using both equations. This one
11032860	11039860	is going to be finding the derivative with a radical. We're going to find the derivative
11040660	11047660	or the slope of the tangent line of f of x equals the square root of x plus 1 at x equals
11050580	11057580	3. x equals 8, sorry, at x equals 8. So to do that, we first need to know the y coordinate.
11057580	11064580	So f of 8 is equal to the square root of 8 plus 1. 8 plus 1 is 9. Square root is 3,
11064580	11071580	so we're talking about the 0.8 comma 3. We have two ways to find the derivative. We're
11072580	11081580	going to do both here, so you can see how they both work out. The first is the limit as x
11082580	11089580	approaches a of f of x minus f of a all over x minus a. So for our problem, the limit as
11092220	11099220	x is going to an x coordinate of 8 of f of x, which is the square root of x plus 1, minus
11103660	11110660	f of a, and we just found out that f of 8 is 3, all over x minus a, and that a value
11111580	11118580	was 8. Now we've worked with limits with removable discontinuities and radicals before. Our strategy
11120460	11125940	in the past was we get rid of the radical by multiplying by the conjugate, and so we'll
11125940	11132940	do just that. We'll multiply by the square root of x plus 1, change it to a plus 3 over
11133060	11139060	the square root of x plus 1 plus 3, and that's going to remove the radical in the numerator
11139060	11146060	and hopefully set up something we can reduce. So we now have the limit as x goes to 8. In
11147420	11152580	the numerator, conjugates will just square both of them and put minus between them. When
11152580	11158020	we square a square root, we're just left with the stuff x plus 1. Always a minus between
11158020	11164520	them and 3 squared is 9. Over, we've got the x minus 8 times the square root of x plus
11164520	11171520	1 plus 3. Clean up a bit to combine like terms in the numerator. We've got the limit as x
11173000	11180000	approaches 8 of x minus 8 over x minus 8 times the square root of x plus 1 plus 3, and that's
11184800	11191300	nice because the x minus 8s divide out. Always remember when we divide out everything, there's
11191300	11197260	still a 1 in the numerator, and what's really nice is we've removed that discontinuity. So
11197260	11204260	we're ready to plug that 8 into x. We've got 1 over the square root of 8 plus 1 plus 3.
11206140	11213140	8 plus 1 is 9, the square root of 9 is 3, plus 3 is 6. We seem to be getting a slope
11214140	11221140	of 1 sixth at x equals 8. Now just to practice the other definition as well, we've got the
11227980	11234980	limit as h approaches 0 of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h. I like writing it every
11235980	11240980	time until you get this ingrained in your head. It's an important formula to know for
11240980	11247980	the rest of this unit and beyond. So we've got the limit as h goes to 0 of f of a. This
11250540	11257540	time a is 8, so we're going to plug 8 plus h into the x, the square root of 8 plus h,
11258540	11265540	and there's a plus 1 minus f of a. We've already calculated that to be 3 all over h. Same strategy
11273380	11277260	from here. We're going to get rid of the radical by multiplying by the conjugate, which is
11277260	11283620	the square root of, let's go ahead and combine the light terms. 8 plus 1 is 9 plus h. We're
11283620	11290620	going to make it a plus 3, square root of 9 plus h plus 3, and when we do that, let's
11292780	11299780	go on to the next line. We've got the limit as h goes to 0 of square the square root.
11300100	11307100	We get 9 plus h, negative 3 plus 3 is negative 9 over h times the square root of 9 plus h
11307100	11314100	plus 3, which is really nice because 9 minus 9 is 0 and that leaves us with the limit as
11318500	11325500	h goes to 0 of h over h times the square root of 9 plus h plus 3. Reduce out the h's, remembering
11325500	11332500	that leaves us with 1, but what's important there is we have removed our discontinuity,
11338140	11345140	so we're ready to plug 0 in for h. We've got 1 over the square root of 9 plus 0 plus 3,
11346260	11353260	which is 1 over 9 plus 0 is 9, the square root of 9 is 3, plus 3 is 6, and we get the
11354020	11361020	exact same slope. We are ready to write the equation of our tangent line at 8 is y equals
11368700	11375700	m, the slope of 1 sixth times x minus the x coordinate of 8 plus the y coordinate of
11376100	11383100	3, y equals 1 sixth times x minus 8 plus 3. That's how we can find the equation of the
11391620	11396140	tangent line at a point. We can use one of these two formulas. I believe the homework
11396140	11400580	assignment tells you which formula to use for a given problem, so you get practice using
11400580	11407060	both formulas with similar types of problems. But once you find the slope of the tangent
11407060	11411180	line from one of those points, we just plug it into our equation formula. Take a look at
11411180	11418180	some problems and we will see you in class. In our previous lesson, we talked about how
11419300	11424860	we could find the derivative at a specific point, but today we're going to extend that
11424860	11431860	discussion and answer the question of how can we calculate the derivative at every point?
11431860	11438860	So, to set this up, we are going to expand our definition of the derivative to, instead
11455540	11458940	of just calculating the slope of the tangent line at a specific point, we're going to
11459020	11466020	start to look at the derivative as a function. And specifically, that function is going to
11471860	11477300	be written as f with a little mark that we call prime, f prime of x. That means it's
11477300	11484300	the derivative of f at x. f prime of x is equal to the limit as h goes to 0. And we're
11485300	11491820	going to take that second definition of a derivative and kind of generalize it to f
11491820	11498820	of x plus h minus f of x all over h. And this is going to be our equation to calculate
11503420	11510420	the derivative as a function for all points x. So, if we can just calculate this thing,
11510860	11517860	we just have to plug in the x value to get the actual derivative at any point we're interested
11517860	11524860	in. So, let's see if we can actually use this formula to find the derivative of, let's start
11524980	11531980	with f of x equals x squared minus 4x plus 1. So, to calculate the derivative f prime
11532980	11539980	of x, we're going to replace each of the x's with the x plus h. So, x plus h, it becomes
11545300	11551940	x plus h squared. Oops, forgot the limit part. Don't forget the limit part, that's important.
11551940	11558940	Limit as h goes to 0 of x plus h squared minus 4 times x, which is now x plus h, plus 1,
11562500	11569140	and then the derivative function says subtract the entire function f of x. It's very important
11569140	11574100	when you do this, you put the function in parentheses because otherwise we're going
11574100	11581100	to run into a sin air. We're not just subtracting the first term. Now, we want to make sure
11581340	11587980	we subtract the entire thing. That negative is going to ultimately, in our next step,
11587980	11594700	compute through that parentheses onto the entire polynomial there. We'll get there in
11594700	11601700	a minute, but don't forget to put the function in parentheses, and it's all over h. So, cleaning
11603900	11610900	this up then, we're going to end up with the limit as h goes to 0 of, and when we square,
11611500	11618500	we get x squared plus 2xh plus h squared. Distribute the negative 4 through, we get
11619100	11626100	negative 4x minus 4h, plus a 1. Then distributing the negative through, we get negative x squared,
11628260	11634460	positive 4x and a negative 1, distributing that negative all the way through, all over
11634460	11641460	h. But what's nice now is this is as ugly as it gets because you'll start to see lots
11641720	11646260	of things are going to disappear. We've got x squared and a negative x squared. Those
11646260	11653260	go to 0. We've got a negative 4x and a positive 4x. Those go to 0. We've got a positive 1
11654780	11661380	and a negative 1. Those go to 0. So, when we clean up, we just have left the limit as
11661380	11668380	h goes to 0 of 2xh plus h squared, minus 4h, all over h. We want to remove the discontinuity
11675280	11682440	at h, and it's nice because we can factor out in h. So, we have the limit as h goes
11682440	11689440	to 0 of h times 2x plus h minus 4, all over h. And now, we're going to get a negative
11692160	11699160	we divide out the h's. We've removed the discontinuity so we can replace h with what it's approaching,
11699880	11706880	0, 2x plus 0 minus 4, or just 2x minus 4, is the equation for the derivative of the tangent
11713140	11720140	line of x squared minus 4x plus 1. Now, if we wanted to know the derivative at any value
11722100	11725640	we just plug in that number. If we want to know what the derivative is when x equals
11725640	11731440	0, plug 0 in, we get negative 4. If we want to know what the derivative is at 10, we
11731440	11737640	plug 10 in, we get 20 minus 4, which is 16. And it's really quick to calculate the derivative
11737640	11744640	now that we have a function to describe it. Let's try one more example. Let's take f of
11745420	11752420	x is equal to the square root of 2x plus 1 and see if we can calculate her derivative.
11759460	11764940	So to calculate the derivative, f prime of x, it's equal to the limit as h approaches
11764940	11771940	0 of f of x plus h. We're going to replace the x with x plus h. That gives us the square
11772940	11779940	root of 2 times x plus h plus 1 minus the function itself, which is the square root
11780540	11787540	of 2x plus 1, all over the h. Well, we've seen square roots before. We know to get rid
11789860	11794300	of them. We multiply by the conjugate. So we have the square root of, and I'm going
11794300	11801300	to go ahead and distribute just to save us the work, 2x plus 2h plus 1. We use plus
11802180	11809180	the opposite sign, the square root of 2x plus 1, and do the same thing in the denominator.
11809220	11816220	2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1. When we do that, we have the limit
11819140	11824420	as h goes to 0. We square the square roots. They're gone. We've got a minus in between
11824420	11831420	them. So we have 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus 2h plus 1 plus 2h plus 2h plus 1 plus 2h plus
11832700	11839300	minus between them. Don't forget the minus between them. Minus, and I'm going to go ahead
11839300	11843860	and distribute that negative onto both parts. Make sure it goes onto both parts. Negative
11843860	11850860	2x minus 1 all over h times, and we'll leave this factor because we want to be able to
11851180	11858180	reduce the square root of 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1. And then
11862460	11869460	things become nice for us. 2x minus 2x is 0. 1 minus 1 is 0. And so we just have the
11872260	11879260	limit as h goes to 0 of 2h over h times the square root of 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the
11883100	11890100	square root of 2x plus 1. And ultimately those h's divide out and we have removed the
11892700	11899700	discontinuity. Now we're ready to plug in what we know. h is 0. So we have 2 over the square
11903900	11910900	root of 2x plus 2 times 0 plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1. What's nice is that
11910900	11917900	square root of 2x plus 1, what's nice is that 2 times 0 is actually equal to 0. So we have
11920100	11927100	matching radicals in the denominator. 2x plus 1 times 2x plus 1. So we've got 2 of those.
11929560	11936560	So we have 2 over 2 square roots of 2x plus 1. And actually we can reduce out the 2's.
11940900	11947900	Which is going to leave behind a 1. So for our final function 1 over the square root
11948340	11955340	of 2x plus 1. So now that we know kind of how to calculate derivatives, and there will
11958660	11963220	be a lot to practice on the assignment and in class, I want to talk a little bit about
11963220	11969100	how the derivative is connected to the graph of the function. We're going to see if we
11969100	11976100	can sketch a graph of a derivative. Because remember the derivative describes the slope
11984140	11991140	or the rate of change of the tangent line. In fact, let's write that down. The derivative
11991580	11998580	is the slope of the tangent line. So if the graph is increasing, if the graph is going
11998580	12005580	uphill, then it's got a positive slope. Because the slope is going uphill. So if we're going
12029020	12036020	in other words, f prime of x has to be greater than zero. That means the graph must be going
12038180	12045180	uphill somehow. You see it's going uphill from left to right. It's got a positive slope.
12048060	12055060	If the slope, or if the graph, is decreasing, the graph is going downhill, and the graph
12058860	12065860	the tangent line will also go downhill. So the slope of the tangent line is negative.
12067060	12073860	In other words, the derivative f prime of x is negative. It's less than zero. The graph
12073860	12080860	is going downhill. So the graph of the tangent line is also negative, showing the downhill
12081860	12088340	slope. I guess we could also say the neutral statement, that if the graph hits a flat
12088420	12095420	point, the graph is flat, then we could say the slope is zero. In other words, we would
12102340	12109060	say f prime of x is equal to zero. That could happen a couple of ways. It could be going
12109060	12114940	up and level out. So there's your slope zero right on top. It could be going down and
12114940	12120900	leveling out. So your slope is zero down there on the bottom. It's completely flat. Or it
12120900	12126460	could make a trough where it comes up, levels out, and keeps going up, or keeps going down.
12126460	12131180	But you notice right in the middle there, the tangent line does level out as it changes
12131180	12135580	direction.
12135580	12150220	So what this looks like then on a graph is, for an example, as if I have a function here,
12150220	12164220	we'll call this f of x. And let's see, we're going to put a point on the graph at, let's
12164820	12171820	give it some height, two. We'll put a point on this graph at negative three, negative
12171820	12186820	two. And another point at negative one, comma two. Then a point at two, comma negative two.
12187500	12192500	And then we'll connect it by coming in from the top, hitting the first point and going
12192500	12196860	up, hitting the second point and going down. And we're going to make a trough where we
12196860	12203360	level out and keep going down at the third point. Let me see if I can make that a little
12203360	12210860	better here. Down, maximum, level off. There we go. Maybe. We'll call that good enough.
12210860	12217860	In order to draw a graph of the derivative of this function, a graph of f prime of x,
12219860	12226860	what we'll do is we'll kind of make some observations about this graph. The first observation that's
12227980	12234980	going to be helpful to us is, identify a graph of f prime of x. What we'll do is we'll kind
12234980	12239820	of make some observations about this graph. The first observation that's going to be helpful
12239820	12246820	to us is identifying where the tangent line is completely flat. Because at all of those
12247460	12254460	points where the tangent line is flat, we know the slope is equal to zero. Which means
12255540	12262340	we've got a zero on our graph at each of those points. So the slope is zero here at negative
12262340	12269340	three. At negative three there's a zero. At negative one the slope is zero. And at positive
12272740	12278940	two the slope is zero. That's where we've got our x intercepts of zero. Because the
12278940	12285940	graph is describing the slope. The next thing I notice is the graph starts going downhill.
12286940	12293940	The slope is negative. So we need to start negative on our graph until we hit that point.
12296380	12301980	After that the graph starts going uphill. It's increasing. The slope is positive until
12301980	12308180	the next zero. So we need to make sure our graph is positive until we hit the next zero.
12308180	12314100	Notice the green line is now all above the x axis positive to the next zero. Then we're
12314100	12320540	decreasing to the next zero. So we're going to be negative. We need to be negative to
12320540	12327540	the next zero. But afterwards it's still decreasing. Which means after the next zero
12328860	12335860	we still need to be decreasing. We still need to be negative. So the graph starts negative,
12336740	12343740	turns positive, turns negative, and then stays negative. And so we've sketched approximately
12344420	12350500	not exactly but pretty close to what the derivative of this first function looks like. Because
12350500	12357500	we know that if the graph is increasing the derivative is positive. If the graph is decreasing
12357860	12364860	the derivative is negative. And if the graph is flat the derivative is zero. I have one
12367540	12372100	more extension I want to put onto this lesson. And it's really just more of the same of
12372100	12378460	what we saw at the beginning along with a little bit of notation. And it's this idea
12378460	12385460	of what we call higher ordered derivatives. And the idea here is if we take a function
12393620	12399740	and we can find its derivative, which is also a function, we should be able to take its
12399820	12405500	derivative to get another function. And then take its derivative to get another function
12405500	12412500	and just keep taking derivatives of derivatives. Derivatives of derivatives. And to set this
12419140	12425740	up I want to talk a little bit about notation and one of the challenges of calculus that
12425740	12432500	came out of it. Calculus was developed simultaneously by both Newton who gets all the credit and
12432500	12437700	Leibniz, I'm probably pronouncing his name wrong, but both of them used a different notation
12437700	12444380	for how to express the derivative. And so as a result we have two different notations
12444380	12451380	for how to express the derivative. Newton used f of x and his compadre used y. And so
12452380	12457900	when we're talking about the first derivative, the derivative that we just take, Newton would
12457900	12464900	just put a prime on it. So we'd see f prime of x to represent the first derivative. Alternatively
12465780	12472780	with just the y we could call that dy dx, which is the derivative of y with respect
12473580	12480580	to x. What the variable is that we're working with. The second derivative then, the derivative
12481500	12486620	of the derivative, with f of x notation we just do a double prime to show the derivative
12486620	12493500	has been taken twice. However with the dy dx notation we say we take the derivatives
12493500	12500500	twice of y with respect to x twice. And so we get d2y over dx2. And then we kind of
12503520	12508660	extend that to the third, fourth, fifth, and beyond derivatives where you'll see three
12508660	12514620	primes to represent the third derivative. And then it's d3y for the third derivative
12514620	12521620	of y with respect to x three times. So that's kind of the notation you might see. But really
12522540	12529540	it just means take the same formula for the same idea. In other words the derivative of
12529540	12536540	the derivative, or f prime prime of x, is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of f prime
12537540	12544540	of x plus h minus f prime of x all over h. In fact I'm not even going to mark this as
12546020	12553020	a key formula because it's the exact same derivative formula. This time we're just working with
12553020	12560020	the derivative to calculate the second derivative. Let's do an example where we can see that
12560020	12569020	worked out. We're going to find the second derivative of 3x squared minus 3x squared minus 3x squared.
12583020	12590020	Minus 4x plus 1. Well in order to find the second derivative we first have to know what
12592380	12598060	the first derivative is. So let's find the first derivative f prime of x is equal to
12598060	12605060	the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h. I'm going to replace the x's with x plus
12605060	12612060	h. 3 times x plus h squared minus 4 times x plus h plus 1 minus the f of x which we're
12620500	12625700	going to put in parentheses so we don't forget to distribute the negative through minus 3x
12625700	12632700	squared minus 4x plus 1 all over h. Which is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of
12635060	12642060	with this first part we have to square the x plus h and then distribute a 3 through. So
12642060	12649060	I'm just going to square it off to the side here. x squared plus 2xh plus h squared. And
12649060	12656060	then I'll distribute the 3 into that. So we have 3x squared plus 6xh plus 3h squared.
12656380	12663380	Distribute the negative to get negative 4x minus 4h plus 1. Distribute the negative through
12672780	12679780	to get negative 3x squared plus 4x minus 1 all over h. Hopefully we can clean this up
12680020	12687020	a bit. 3x squared minus 3x squared is 0. Negative 4x plus 4x is 0. 1 minus 1 is 0. And so we
12701860	12708860	have the limit as h goes to zero of 6xh plus 3h squared. And so we have the limit as h
12709780	12716780	squared minus 4h all over h. And we remove that discontinuity by factoring out the h.
12722860	12729860	Times 6x plus 3h minus 4 all over the h. The h is divided out and now we can just plug
12730860	12737860	in the 0. So we have 6x plus 3 times 0 minus 4 which is equal to just 6x minus 4. But that
12749100	12756100	is just the first derivative. This problem wanted us to find the second derivative. So
12756540	12763540	using our new function we take the derivative again. f prime prime of x is equal to the
12767340	12774340	limit as h goes to 0 of f of x plus h. We are going to replace the x with x plus h. So
12774660	12781660	we have 6 times x plus h minus 4. Subtract the function or subtract the 6x minus 4 and
12782660	12789660	put it all over h. Distributing through we get the limit as h goes to 0 of 6x plus 6h
12795380	12802380	minus 4 minus 6x plus 4. Distributing that negative through all over h. Fortunately we
12803380	12810380	can subtract some things out. 6 minus 6x is 0. Negative 4 plus 4 is 0. And so we have
12816220	12823220	the limit as h goes to 0 of 6h over h. Which is really nice because the h is divided out.
12824220	12831220	And we are just left with a single simple number 6 as our second derivative of 3x squared
12836340	12843340	minus 4x plus 1. If I wanted to find the third derivative we would just run through the formula
12843980	12850020	again. But ultimately with this lesson today the important key thing is that you know the
12850020	12857020	function for the derivative is the limit as h goes to 0 of f of x plus h minus f of x
12859260	12865260	all over h. Try a few and practice this. We will take a look at it more in class and we
12865260	12871260	will see you then. Now that we have gotten comfortable with the definition of the derivative
12871260	12877540	the common frustration is how tedious that formula is. So the question that starts to
12877540	12884540	come up is what are some derivative shortcuts so that we don't have to go through that formula
12893620	12900620	every time. And you can imagine as a function becomes very complicated the derivative function
12900880	12906500	could become very tedious to work through. Well there is lots of derivative shortcuts
12906500	12910260	we are going to look at over the next several lessons. We are going to look today at four
12910260	12917260	basic shortcuts. And then after that we will take a look at two important shortcuts that
12922580	12929580	are a little bit more involved. The most basic is the constant shortcut. And the idea of
12929820	12936820	the constant shortcut is if we take the derivative d dx is the alternative notation for a derivative
12939740	12946740	the derivative of some constant or some number we are going to always get 0 for our answer
12947740	12954740	because if a constant is a straight line the derivative of a straight flat line is 0. So
12954740	12961740	for example if I wanted to calculate the derivative of 5 a constant well that is just going to
12967060	12974060	be 0 because 5 is not changing it has a slope of 0. The second basic shortcut is the power
12974460	12981460	rule and this is probably the one we will use the most. And the idea is if we are taking
12981460	12988460	the derivative of x raised to some exponent. When we have x raised to some exponent we
12991580	12998580	will pull that exponent out in front and then we will reduce the exponent by 1. And this
12999580	13006580	is probably the most used derivative shortcut. With polynomials we pull the exponent out
13008340	13015340	front and then decrease the exponent by 1. So for example if I wanted the derivative
13015340	13022340	of x to the 7th power all I have to do is I move that 7th power out front and then I
13023340	13030340	reduce the exponent by 1 and we get 7x to the 6th. A third rule I am going to call it
13036820	13041740	the sum rule it is often called the difference rule as well because it works with plus or
13041740	13048740	minus and the idea is if I take the derivative of some function plus or minus another function
13049740	13056740	where I know the derivative of the individual pieces all I have to do is take the derivative
13057420	13064420	of the individual pieces and it is f prime plus g prime of x. So for example combining
13069140	13074980	the power rule and the sum rule together it should be plus or minus. If I wanted the
13074980	13081980	derivative of x to the 5th minus x squared plus x plus 2 we just take the derivatives
13087120	13092460	of the individual pieces. The power rule says we move the exponent out front and subtract
13092460	13098960	1. So we get 5x to the 4th minus x squared bring the 2 out front, subtract 1 from the
13098960	13105840	exponent we just have x plus with x that is really x to the 1st so we pull the 1 out
13105840	13112840	front and drop it by 1 so x to the 0 is just 1 and then the derivative of 2 a constant
13113480	13120480	is just 0 so all that we are left with is the 5x to the 4th minus 2x plus 1. The final
13120480	13127480	basic shortcut is the constant multiplier which says if I am taking the derivative of
13127480	13134480	some constant times a function we keep that constant in front and multiply it by the derivative
13136040	13143040	of that constant and then we multiply it by the derivative of that constant and then we
13150480	13157480	get the inside function and that is the 4th basic shortcut. So for example if I wanted
13166000	13173000	the derivative now of 3x to the 5th minus 2x to the 4th plus 5x squared minus 7x plus
13174000	13181000	1. Let's get us a little more white board space so we can put it right underneath it.
13186200	13192560	The 3 can just be multiplied by whatever the derivative is of x to the 5th. Well we know
13192560	13199560	we pulled that exponent out front so 3 times 5 is 15, x to the 1 less 4th power minus bringing
13200560	13207560	the exponent out front 2 times 4 is 8, x cubed shrinking the exponent by 1 plus 2 times 5
13209920	13216920	is 10, x shrinking the exponent by 1 minus 7 times 1 is 7. Shrink the exponent by 1 and
13218560	13224200	the x disappears and the derivative of the constant is 0 so now we have our new derivative
13224200	13231200	of that polynomial. These 4 basic rules of differentiation will save us a lot of work
13233320	13240320	and time on that derivative formula. Now in fact we should be able to quite quickly find
13240320	13247320	the equation of the tangent line to f of x equals 4x cubed minus 2x squared plus 2x squared
13270320	13277320	plus 5x minus 1 at x equals negative 1. Well first we need to know what the y coordinate
13281520	13287920	is that we're going to end up with. Actually no, first let's actually find the derivative
13287920	13294920	at 1. So first we're going to take the derivative f prime of x is equal to 4 times 3 is 12,
13295920	13302920	x squared subtract 1 from the exponent minus 2 times 2 is 4, x plus 5 and the x disappears.
13309920	13315520	We want it at specifically x equals negative 1 so we'll do f prime of negative 1 which
13315520	13322520	is 12 times negative 1 squared minus 4 times negative 1 plus 5 and if we work that out
13323520	13330520	it becomes 12 plus 4 plus 5 is 21. So the slope we now know is 21. We do need to know
13344840	13351520	the y coordinate of this point when x is 1 what is y equal? So we do need to plug the
13351520	13358520	negative 1 into the original function as well. f of negative 1 is equal to 4 times negative
13358520	13365520	1 cubed minus 2 times negative 1 squared plus 5 times negative 1 minus 1. So our y coordinate
13367600	13374600	is equal to negative 4 plus 2 minus 5 minus 1 which gives us negative 12. So we're going
13382200	13389200	to take the derivative at 1 minus 12. So for the equation of our line, y equals the slope
13390400	13397400	we found out was 21 times x minus x1 minus negative 1 is plus 1 minus 12 and our line
13402200	13409200	tangent to our function is 21 times x plus 1 minus 12. So those are our basic equations
13412520	13417560	to help with differentiation. The next two are a little more involved and they take a
13417560	13423320	bit of practice to get used to using. We'll see a lot of errors with this one particularly
13423320	13430320	which is the product rule. The product rule says that the derivative of two pieces that
13434120	13440720	are multiplied by each other f of x times g of x. The common error I see is people just
13440920	13446720	take the derivative of both and multiply and they say f prime times g prime. That is incorrect
13446720	13453400	and it does not work. What we actually do is the derivative of the first part times the
13453400	13460400	second part plus the derivative of the second part times the first part. So there's two
13464480	13469400	parts to it and we take the derivative of the first part in the first part and the derivative
13469400	13476400	of the second part in the second part. So for example if I wanted to take the derivative
13477360	13484360	of 3x squared minus 5x plus 1 times 2x squared plus 4x minus 7 we've got two individual parts.
13484640	13491640	So the formula says we take the derivative of the first part. The first part, the 3x
13500520	13504280	squared, let's color code these. We'll do the first part in blue and the second part
13504280	13509000	in green just so we can see how this works out. So in blue the derivative of the first
13509000	13516000	part is 6x minus 5. Then that is multiplied by the second part 2x squared plus 4x minus
13519840	13526840	7. Plus then we take the derivative of the second part. The derivative of the second
13530880	13537880	part is 4x plus 4 times the second part. 3x squared plus 4x plus 4 times the second part
13539000	13546000	of 5x squared minus 5x plus 1. And this then as ugly as it looks is the correct answer
13549120	13556120	for the derivative of that product. The derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative
13558920	13565920	of the second times the first. Let's look at one more. Let's do the derivative of 5 over
13566360	13573360	x squared plus 3 over x times 2x cubed minus 7. Whoa, we don't really have a derivative
13581720	13587480	trick for x as being in the denominator. Actually we do. We just need to tweak this
13587480	13592960	problem a little bit and rewrite it as the derivative of and think about what type of
13593040	13600040	exponent sticks things in the denominator. Well a negative exponent does that. This is
13600040	13607040	really 5x to the negative 2 plus 3x to the negative 1 times the 2x cubed minus 7. So
13612120	13619120	again now we are multiplying two polynomials. A first part times the second part. And the
13619720	13626720	formula says it's equal to the derivative of the first. 5 times negative 2 is negative
13626720	13633720	10x. And if we subtract 1 from negative 2 the new exponent is negative 3. 3 times negative
13634960	13641960	1 is negative 3x. Subtract 1 from the exponent and we get negative 2. The derivative of the
13641960	13648960	first times the second 2x cubed minus 7 plus the derivative of the second 2 times 3 is
13656480	13663480	6x squared and the negative 7 is a constant so there is nothing there. Times the first
13664480	13671480	5x to the negative 1. I'm sorry 5x to the negative 2 plus 3x to the negative 1. And
13676400	13683400	this then is the derivative of that product. That is the product rule. Similar to the product
13683400	13690400	rule is what we are going to call the quotient rule. And I should probably label this as C. The quotient
13700360	13707360	rule. And it's got two tweaks to make it different. But it's very similar. If I'm taking the
13707520	13714520	derivative of two things that are divided. F of x divided by g of x. Be careful this is
13715080	13722080	not f prime divided by g prime. We can't just divide the derivatives. Instead we will take
13724000	13731000	the derivative of the first times the second. And because this is division we will actually
13731000	13738000	subtract the derivative of the second times the first. And the big difference here is
13738720	13745720	we have to divide by the denominator squared. Which is kind of interesting. We end up with
13746840	13753840	the square denominator in the denominator. So for example if I'm being asked to find
13754480	13761480	the derivative of 4x squared minus 5x plus 1. Over x squared minus 7. We've got a top
13765240	13772240	piece. And we've got a bottom piece. Keeping track of that then we take the derivative
13774440	13781440	of the first piece. 4 times 2 is 8x minus 5. Times the denominator just like it is.
13784400	13791400	x squared minus 7. Then we subtract the derivative of the denominator. x squared becomes 2x.
13797240	13804240	Times the numerator which is 4x squared minus 5x plus 1. And then in the denominator we
13805180	13812180	take the old denominator. x squared minus 7. And we square it. To get our final result
13813840	13820840	we take the final big ugly but correct derivative. This formula takes a little bit of practice
13823360	13830360	to get really comfortable with. But it certainly is much nicer than doing it with the derivative
13830360	13836360	formula. Let's do another one. Let's take the derivative of the square root of x over
13836360	13843360	2x cubed minus 7 over x. We get the derivative of the derivative of the square root of x
13843960	13850960	one thing you might notice right away is that we need to rewrite that so it's that friendly
13851880	13858880	polynomial so we can use our exponent trick. So we're going to actually find the derivative.
13858880	13865880	Square root is really just a one half power over 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one
13866880	13873880	which is what moved that x into the denominator. Now we have a clear numerator and denominator
13876160	13883160	to use in our formula. We take the derivative of the first one. Pull the exponent out front.
13885080	13892080	x subtract one from one half. One half minus one is negative one half. Times the denominator
13892360	13899360	which is 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one. Subtract and then we take the derivative
13905360	13911720	of the denominator. Two times three is six x squared. Negative seven times negative one
13911720	13918720	is positive seven x to the now negative two times the first function which is x to the
13918720	13925720	one half. And this is all over that denominator 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one squared.
13933320	13940320	And we now have the derivative of our quotient. And we now have the derivative of our quotient
13949720	13954040	Now that we have a couple derivative rules we can actually take a look at some applications
13954040	13960280	of the derivative and solve some more interesting problems. And one of the most common applications
13960280	13967280	of the derivative is the relationship between the position of an object, the velocity of
13968120	13975120	that object, and that object's acceleration. All three of these things are connected by
13989360	13996360	derivatives because the derivative is the rate of change. And so the velocity does not
13997680	14001880	describe how the position is changing. The acceleration describes how the velocity is
14001880	14008880	changing. So these three variables or functions really we can make for each of them. The position
14014320	14021320	describes where the object is at time t. And we will use the derivative of the derivative
14027280	14034280	to use the function s of t to represent the object's position at a given moment of time.
14034840	14041840	But it's moving. And so to describe the speed or rate at which it's moving we have the velocity.
14043880	14050880	Which the velocity can be thought of as speed, but speed doesn't really have a direction.
14051240	14056000	Velocity does have a direction. Positive, generally meaning to the right. Negative, generally meaning
14056000	14063000	to the left. So speed with direction. Or the rate of change at which the position is
14064280	14071280	changing. So the change in position. So we will use v of t to represent the velocity
14076240	14081040	at a specific point in time. But because it's the change in position we say that it's
14081040	14088040	the derivative of the position. Finally we have the acceleration. Or how fast the velocity
14095920	14102920	is changing. The change in velocity. And we use a of t to represent the acceleration.
14103920	14110760	And we use a of t to represent the acceleration. And because that's describing the change in
14110760	14117760	velocity that's the derivative of the velocity. Or the second derivative of the position.
14120420	14125200	So knowing that we have this relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration
14125200	14132200	all connected by the derivative we can solve problems in relationship to these three questions.
14132920	14140800	So for example if the position of an object in feet after t seconds is given by s of t
14162920	14170920	is equal to t cubed divided by 5 minus 3 over t squared. What is its velocity and acceleration?
14193800	14200800	After two seconds. First thing I'm going to do with this function is I'm going to change
14213200	14218040	it to be a nicer polynomial because I don't like having the, or a nicer rational expression.
14218040	14222200	I don't like having the fraction in a fraction. So I'm going to write that as t to the negative
14222200	14229200	2. So s of t is equal to t cubed over 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2 power. And then we can
14235040	14242040	take the derivative of this function to find the velocity function. So the velocity at
14243360	14250360	time t, this is a quotient. So we take the derivative of the top which is 3 t squared
14251360	14258360	times the denominator which is 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2 minus the derivative of
14259000	14266000	the denominator which is negative 3 times negative 2 is positive 6 t to the negative
14266400	14273400	3 times the numerator t cubed all over the denominator 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2
14274400	14281400	squared. I'm going to clean that up a little bit just so that we can take a second derivative
14286360	14292200	of it because we're also being asked about the acceleration. So when we distribute through
14292200	14299200	we get 3 times 5 is 15 t squared minus 9 and when we add the exponents we get 0 t's.
14304400	14311400	And then minus 6 and we have 0 t's. Since we have negative 9 minus 6 I'm going to write
14314320	14321320	that as negative 15 over and I'm going to go ahead and square this out. We've got 25
14325480	14332480	minus 30 t to the negative 2 plus 9 t to the negative 4.
14333400	14340400	So we should be able to calculate the velocity after 2 seconds by plugging 2 into this formula
14348360	14355360	15 times 2 squared minus 15 over 25 minus 30 times not t but 2 to the negative 2 plus
14355360	14362360	9 t which is 2 to the negative 4 power. And we can plug this into our handy dandy calculator.
14366360	14373360	Second quit to get me to the home screen. We need a parenthesis around the numerator 15
14376080	14383080	times 2 squared minus 15 close the parenthesis the velocity.
14385560	14392560	Divided by parenthesis for the denominator 25 minus 30 times 2 raised to the negative
14393480	14400480	2 power plus 9 times 2 raised to the negative 4 power and then close the parenthesis on
14403320	14410320	the denominator and my velocity at 2 seconds seems to be about 2.49.
14416360	14423360	Feet per second almost 2.5 feet every second this guy is going to travel. That's the velocity.
14429080	14433960	But the problem is also asking for the acceleration so let's scroll down to give us some more white
14433960	14440960	board space. The acceleration then at t is going to be the derivative of the velocity.
14441960	14448960	So we've got this derivative of a velocity function. So we'll take the derivative of
14451120	14458120	the numerator which is 30 t times the denominator which is 25 minus 30 t to the negative 2 plus
14460480	14467480	9 t to the negative 4 minus the derivative of the denominator negative 30 times negative
14467480	14474480	2 is positive 60 t to the negative 3 minus 36 t to the negative 5 times the numerator
14484280	14491280	which is 15 t squared minus 15 and then that is all over the denominator squared 25 minus
14492280	14499280	30 t to the negative 2 plus 9 t to the negative 4 all squared. Now the problem was asking
14503360	14508040	us what's the acceleration at 2 seconds. So in order to get that we're going to need
14508040	14512680	to go back to our calculators. I'm not going to write it out I'm just going to put 2 in
14512680	14519680	for everything all the way across here. So we've got the numerator parenthesis 30 times
14520640	14527640	2 open a parenthesis 25 minus 30 times 2 raised to the negative 2 power plus 9 times 2 raised
14535360	14542360	to the negative 4 power close the parenthesis minus open a parenthesis 60 times 2 raised
14543360	14550360	to the negative 3 power minus 36 times 2 raised to the negative 5 power close the parenthesis
14560880	14567880	open a parenthesis 15 times 2 squared minus 15 close the parenthesis and close the parenthesis
14568320	14575320	on the numerator divided by denominator open a parenthesis 25 minus 30 t which we know
14579840	14586840	is 2 raised to the negative 2 power plus 9 times 2 raised to the negative 4 power close
14590720	14597720	the parenthesis on the denominator and square the denominator and hit enter the denominator
14597880	14604880	to find out our acceleration is 2.44 feet per second squared. So it might have been ugly
14611920	14616720	to type in the calculator but it just took time it wasn't difficult plugging 2 in for
14616720	14623160	all those t's. So that's velocity, acceleration and position derivatives of each other but
14623160	14627440	the big thing that I want you to practice with these differentiation rules specifically
14627440	14633240	focus on the product rule and the quotient rule. The sooner you master those the more
14633240	14638960	advantage you will have moving forward in our calculus class. So take a look at those practice
14638960	14645960	practice practice and we will see you in class to practice some more.
14645960	14651280	Now that we're able to quickly calculate derivatives we're able to look at some applications of
14651280	14658280	how we can use the derivative to model some real world situations. So our question is
14658480	14665480	what are some applications of the derivative? And the first one we've already kind of hinted
14666000	14673000	at over the past couple of lessons but we're going to formalize our discussion around position
14674440	14681440	which we use s of t as a function to represent position over time. Velocity is a function
14682840	14688840	of the derivative. And the first one we've already kind of hinted at over the past couple
14688840	14695840	of lessons. Where we use s of t as a function to represent position over time. Velocity
14697720	14704720	where we use v of t to represent the velocity over time. And acceleration. Where we use
14709120	14716120	a of t to represent the acceleration at some point in time. Now we've already discussed
14716760	14723760	the fact that the velocity is the derivative of position. Or more specifically v of t is
14735720	14742720	equal to the s prime of t. And we've also discussed that the acceleration of the derivative
14746120	14753120	is the derivative of the velocity. Or a of t is equal to v prime of t or the second derivative
14767600	14774600	of the position s prime prime of t. But what we haven't discussed is how velocity and acceleration
14776680	14783680	work together or against each other. For example, I want to look at if the acceleration is in
14792400	14799400	the same direction as the velocity. And if the acceleration is in the same direction,
14807120	14814120	in other words, we're getting more and more push in the direction that we're going. If
14814240	14819520	you think about the football player who's trying to get the first down on third and
14819520	14825160	inches, the players on his own team are pushing him as he accelerates in the same direction
14825160	14832160	as the push. He's going to end up going further and faster. So the object is going to, let
14833160	14840160	me put the word behind the front, the object will speed up because we're being pushed
14848160	14853780	in the direction we're running so we will run faster. And the opposite is also true
14853780	14860780	if they are in opposite directions. And the opposite is also true if they are in opposite
14862160	14869160	directions. Sticking with the football player analogy, you've got a football player running
14870640	14876840	down field and the defender grabs him and pulls him backwards. It doesn't necessarily
14876840	14881440	mean he's going to go backwards, but he's not going to go forward at the same speed
14881440	14888440	because those forces are in opposite directions. So because the push and the speed are in opposite
14888520	14895520	directions, it or the person slows down. So the acceleration pushes or pulls to either
14901400	14908400	speed up or slow down. The question is, are they going in the same direction? So let's
14909880	14916880	look at an example. The position of an object, the position of an object, the position of
14918440	14922440	an object, actually that's, we're going to have two examples. So let's say number three's
14922440	14929440	examples and example A is going to be the position of an object in t seconds is given
14929440	14936440	by s of t equals t cubed minus three t squared minus forty five t plus seven. So this is
14960440	14967440	the question we want to know is when is it speeding up? And when is it slowing down?
14983360	14987400	When are the acceleration and velocity pushing in the same direction? And when are they pushing
14987440	14994440	pulling against each other in opposite directions? Let's get us some space to work on that and
14995360	15001480	we'll attempt to answer that by first finding the function for the velocity, which is the
15001480	15008480	derivative of the s of t. And the derivative there is going to be three t squared minus
15009200	15016200	six t minus forty five. The acceleration then is going to be the derivative of the velocity,
15025800	15032800	which is going to be six t minus six. So we need to know when these are changing directions.
15033800	15038800	When does the velocity change directions from left to right? When does the acceleration
15038800	15043800	change from speed up to slow down or push to pull? And so really what we need to know
15043800	15049800	is when do they each cross the threshold of zero? Because that's when they change directions
15049800	15055800	from positive to negative, from push to pull, from faster to slower. So for each of these
15055800	15061800	we're going to solve for when they equal zero. So with the velocity zero equals three t squared
15062240	15068920	minus six t minus forty five. And we can solve that by first factoring out the gcf of three
15068920	15075920	t squared minus two t minus fifteen. And then continuing to factor that's t minus five
15076840	15083840	t plus three. And so setting each factor equal to zero, t is equal to five, or negative
15084220	15091220	three. Now generally we don't talk about negative times, so we're going to start at zero for
15091220	15096300	all of our time references, so really we don't care about the three. But at five, things
15096300	15103300	are probably changing at five because the velocity is changing direction at five.
15104980	15108020	Same thing with the acceleration, we want to know when that changes, so we'll make that
15108020	15115020	equal to zero, six t minus six. Add six to both sides, and six t equals six, divide by
15116020	15123020	six and t equals one, so something else of note is happening at one. So what we want
15123840	15130840	to know is if I make a little timeline here, something happens at one, and something happens
15131900	15138900	at five. We're going to look at how the velocity and the acceleration are behaving in these
15139420	15146420	time ranges. Specifically what we're interested in is are they positive or are they negative?
15152080	15155700	Because that's going to tell us if they're pushing each other or if they're pulling against
15155700	15161700	each other. Fortunately this is really easy to do on our calculators. What we're going
15161700	15168700	to do is we're going to type in the function for the velocity in y one, and then we'll
15170980	15177980	type in the function for the acceleration in y two. So y one, the velocity is three
15178780	15185780	t squared, we don't really have a t so we're going to use x, minus six t, or x, minus 45.
15186380	15193380	And in y two it's six t, or six x, minus six. Then we're going to go to the table settings.
15199500	15206340	Second table, and we can delete out whatever we were working on before. And what we'll
15206340	15213340	do for our x is we're going to pick an x that falls within each range on this number line.
15214300	15220100	So first we need something between zero and one, because our graph really starts at zero,
15220100	15227100	and we want to know what's happening in the middle of each of these areas. So between
15227100	15233300	zero and one, a good number is point five. Hit enter. And looking at that I see that
15233300	15239580	they're both negative. Remember the first, the middle column, the y one is the velocity,
15239580	15244660	the next one, the y two is the acceleration. But they're both negative, and that's what's
15244660	15251660	important to me right now, is they are negative between zero and one. Now let's pick something
15254060	15260660	between one and five, maybe three, three falls between one and five. Notice there the first
15260660	15267660	one, the velocity is negative, but the acceleration is positive. So the velocity is negative, but
15268580	15275580	the acceleration is positive. Finally we need something past five, maybe eight. We can
15278120	15284560	pick any number past five. And when I do that I see that they are both positive. So the
15284560	15291560	velocity is positive, and the acceleration is positive. Now we're ready to kind of interpret
15292120	15298120	what we've got here. When the velocity and the acceleration are both going in the same
15298280	15304280	direction, notice between zero and one they're both negative. That means the velocity it's
15304280	15309280	going backwards, and the acceleration is pushing further backwards, same direction,
15309280	15315780	we're going backwards at a faster and faster rate, we're actually speeding up between zero
15316220	15323220	and one. Then between one and five we see they're going in opposite directions. The
15325380	15330260	velocity is negative, so we're going backwards, but the acceleration is pulling it forward,
15330260	15335420	so it's starting to slow down and slow down and slow down because they're pulling in
15335420	15341620	opposite directions. Until finally the acceleration wins and gets the velocity going in the other
15341660	15347020	direction, and now they're both going in the positive direction with the acceleration pushing
15347020	15353220	in the positive direction, so we're going faster and faster. So again when they're the
15353220	15360220	same we're speeding up, when they're different we're slowing down. So giving it as a range
15361620	15368420	this item is speeding up between zero and one second, union five all the way to infinity,
15368420	15375420	and we'll always speed up while it's going to slow down between one and five.
15379300	15383140	Let's do another example where we can take a look at how the position of an object is
15383140	15390140	changing whether it's being pushed or pulled in the same direction or in the opposite direction.
15391140	15398140	So let's say the position of an object in seconds, using t for seconds, is given by s of t equals
15398420	15405420	x cubed minus 9x squared plus 24x minus 3, and so our question, our theme, is given
15409820	15416820	by s of t equals x cubed minus 9x squared plus 24x minus 3, and so our question is
15428460	15435460	when is it speeding up and slowing down? And we can decide that by looking at the velocity
15444340	15450780	function and the acceleration function, and determine when they're pushing or pulling
15450780	15457380	in the same direction or opposite directions. So the velocity, that's just the derivative
15457380	15464380	of the position, which is 3x squared minus 18x plus 24, the acceleration, it's the derivative
15469060	15476060	of the velocity, so that's 6x minus 18, and we're specifically interested when both of
15476060	15482560	these are changing between positive and negative because that's where things are going to change,
15482560	15489560	and they change at 0. So 0 equals 3x squared minus 18x plus 24 on the velocity, we'll factor
15493520	15500520	out a 3x squared minus 6x plus 4, nope, plus 8, sorry, 24 divided by 3 is 8, 0 equals 3
15500520	15507520	times x minus 4 times x minus 2, and so this time we have two solutions, x equals 4 and
15514800	15521800	x equals 2. With the acceleration we get our other key point by making it equal to 0, 6x
15522680	15529680	minus 18. If we add 18 to both sides and divide by 6, we get x is equal to 3. So something
15530520	15537520	is probably happening at 2, 3, and 4. So we'll make our little number line here, 0, 2, 3,
15544160	15551160	and 4, and we're going to be interested in what happens to the velocity and what happens
15551160	15558160	to the acceleration. Again, we'll use our calculator to help us do this a little quick,
15560520	15567640	quicker, hit y equals, and we're going to clear out the functions that are in here, make
15567640	15573640	sure you clear them out so you don't accidentally get the previous problem in here. The velocity
15573640	15580640	was 3x squared minus 18x, oops, x, 18x, there we go, plus 24, and we're going to be interested
15590520	15597520	in 4, and the acceleration is 6x minus 18, hit second table, delete out the old points,
15607440	15613160	and we need something between 0 and 2, 1 is between 0 and 2, and we've got a positive,
15613160	15618760	then a negative. The velocity is positive, the acceleration is negative, they're going
15618800	15625800	in opposite directions to begin with. Between 2 and 3, let's try 2.5, now they're both negative.
15628480	15633480	Looks like the acceleration ended up winning here, so the velocity is negative and the
15633480	15640480	acceleration is negative. Pick something between 3 and 4, maybe 3.5. Now notice the velocity
15641480	15648480	is negative, but the acceleration has changed to positive, so the velocity is still negative,
15651440	15657940	but the acceleration is now pulling it in the positive direction. Finally, bigger than
15657940	15665440	4, we can pick any number bigger than 4, I picked 5, we see they're both positive, so
15665440	15672440	now the velocity is positive and the acceleration is positive, and it's going to stay that way
15672720	15679720	all the way up to infinity. So we see initially the velocity is positive, the acceleration
15682960	15687800	is negative, they're in opposite directions, it's going to slow down there. Between 2 and
15687800	15693160	3 they're in the same direction, it's going to speed up. Between 3 and 4 they're in opposite
15693200	15699120	directions, slowing down, and then 4 on up it's going to speed up. So writing that as
15699120	15706120	a range, we're speeding up between 2 and 3, union from 4 to infinity, and we're slowing
15709880	15716880	down from 0 to 2, union from 3 to 4, this particle is actually slowing down to ultimately
15716960	15723960	change directions. So that's one application of the derivative, position, velocity, acceleration,
15731480	15738480	speeding up, and slowing down. A second application that we're going to take a look at is in business,
15738900	15745900	with the idea of revenue, cost, profit, and what are called marginal changes. When we
15746120	15753120	say a marginal change in business, that is the change for revenue, cost, profit, and what
15753540	15760540	are called marginal changes. When we say a marginal change in business, that is the change
15760540	15767540	for one more. And usually this is on the large scale, so once I make 1,000 widgets, if I make
15770340	15777340	one more widget, 1,001 widgets, is it more profitable or less profitable, more cost, less cost,
15777340	15784340	making one more, how's that going to affect my bottom line? And that can help us make
15785140	15792140	the decision if it's worth expanding or shrinking the business at this given time. Because we're
15792540	15798540	talking about change, a marginal change, which is a very small change, we are going to make
15798540	15805540	one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more,
15807340	15814340	we can estimate the marginal change with the derivative. Let's break down some of these
15824620	15831620	business terms. We've got cost, which we normally represent with c of x, and we've got marginal
15832540	15839540	cost. For marginal cost, we do m c of x for marginal cost, which is actually estimated,
15848500	15855500	not actually, but estimated by the derivative of the cost function. We've also got revenue.
15862460	15868740	Revenue, we usually use r of x for revenue, and often we have to find that because what
15868740	15874940	we actually have is some price function that needs to be multiplied by the number of things
15874940	15881940	that we sell. So if the price is $5 and we sell $7, 5 times 7, we've made $21 in revenue.
15882940	15889940	This price function, the price per item, is often a function because the price is going
15900420	15907420	to be dependent on various variables. So we've got the revenue, and we've also got marginal
15908100	15915100	revenue, and as you might expect, we use mr for marginal revenue of x, which can be estimated
15919620	15926620	using the derivative of the revenue. Finally, what we're always interested in in business
15929740	15936740	is the profit. The profit is p of x, which is simply calculated by taking the revenue
15937540	15944540	or the amount of money we took in and subtracting the cost that it took to bring in that money.
15946020	15953020	And we also have a marginal profit, or how much more money do we make for selling one
15955340	15961340	more? So marginal profit of x, as you might expect, is equal to the derivative of the
15961340	15968340	profit at x. So those are kind of the parts of the profit function. Let's take a look
15974300	15981300	at some examples and see if we can wrap our head around what is this marginal profit, marginal
15982260	15989260	cost, and marginal revenue. First, the cost of the profit is p of x, which is equal to
15992340	15999340	to develop a product is c of x is equal to 500 plus 12x. Startup cost of 500, and then
16010420	16017420	each one costs $12. You want to know what is the marginal cost
16021340	16028340	of the 100 first item. Now, a nice way to estimate the marginal cost of x is to simply
16038940	16044980	take the derivative of the cost function. Well, this is really nice because the derivative
16044980	16051980	of 500 plus 12x is just 12. So we will estimate that the 12th item will cost 12 extra dollars.
16055260	16060420	I'm sorry, the 100th item will cost 12 extra dollars because every single one we add to
16060420	16067420	it costs 12 extra dollars. That is probably a less exciting example. So let's try a price
16067420	16075220	function. The price function for the product, same product, is p equals 126 minus 0.16 x.
16098100	16105100	We want to know what is the marginal revenue for the 100 first item. So first we need
16105100	16112100	to know what is the revenue function. Remember, revenue is always x times the price function.
16112100	16119820	The number of things we sell times the price for each one of those. That is 126 minus 0.16x.
16142860	16149860	If I distribute to make the derivative easier, 126x minus 0.16x squared. So then the marginal
16154500	16161500	revenue of x is pretty darn close to the derivative of the revenue. So that is 126 minus 0.32x.
16161500	16168500	So that is 126 minus 0.32x. And we want to know the marginal revenue of the 100 first
16173900	16180900	item. So we can plug 101 into this function to estimate it. 126 minus 0.32 times 101.
16183780	16190780	And quickly typing that in my calculator we will get 93 dollars and 68 cents. Which means
16191500	16198500	after I've sold 100 items the 101st item is going to make me another 93 dollars and 68
16198900	16205900	cents. Or so. How accurate is that estimate? Because remember I did say it is an estimate.
16210620	16217620	Let's find out. Note the actual. Because the derivative is just an estimate, it's going
16218380	16225880	to be off by a bit. Because the tangent line touches at 100. But not necessarily at 101,
16225880	16232060	it's off by a little bit. So we could calculate the revenue at 100. How much revenue we've
16232060	16239060	already made at 100? So the revenue equation was 126 times 100 minus 0.16 times 100 squared.
16240060	16247060	And plug that into my calculator we actually make $11,000. The revenue at 101 is 126 times
16255100	16262100	101 minus 0.16 times 101 squared. We make $11,093.84. And so if we want the marginal revenue that
16269180	16276180	is how much more we made for the 101st item. We subtract these. 11,093.84 minus 11,000.
16279420	16286180	We actually get 93 dollars and 84 cents is the actual marginal revenue. The 101st item
16286180	16293180	actually brings us in 93.84. But much quicker with the derivative we estimated 93.68 which
16294180	16299180	is pretty darn close and probably good enough for this business to make a decision based
16299180	16306180	on. We're not going to care about less than about 15 cents, 16 cents of a difference when
16306540	16312180	we're trying to make decisions on our product whether to expand or contract. So that's why
16312180	16319180	it's always better to use the derivative because it's quicker, it's easier, it's clearer
16319180	16325180	to understand. The actuals just take too long to calculate and really don't make much of
16325180	16332180	a difference. So we've done costs and we've done revenue. Let's add one more though. What's
16332820	16339820	the marginal profit? For the 101st item.
16349180	16356180	Well, remember P of X, the profit is equal to the revenue function minus the cost function.
16365500	16372000	And the revenue function, we've got it up here above on part B. It's 126X minus 0.16X
16372000	16379000	squared minus the cost function which was given to us up here in part A, 500 plus 12X.
16385560	16391760	So distributing that minus, because we have to subtract the whole thing, minus 500 minus
16391760	16398760	12X. And then actually combining like terms we get negative 0.16X squared plus 0.16X
16402520	16409520	114X minus 16X. Oops, minus 500. Keep things in the right order. And so if we want the
16415040	16421240	marginal profit, we take the derivative. The marginal profit of X is equal to the derivative
16421240	16428240	of the profit function which is negative 0.32X plus 114. And then we get the marginal profit
16433000	16440000	and we want the marginal profit of the 101st item. So plugging 101 in there, negative 0.32
16442720	16449720	times 101 plus 114. If we were to make one more item, we would make an additional $81.68
16454480	16461480	our marginal profit. I want to make a difference in the marginal profit.
16462000	16467600	We want to do one more application of the derivative based on where we're at right now.
16467600	16474600	And that is in population change. Truth is anytime you see the word change, we're really
16477880	16484880	dealing with a derivative in action. Anything that changes is the derivative. So with population
16485540	16492540	change, if we use P of t to represent the population at time t, then the derivative
16501040	16508040	P prime of t is the rate of change of the population. And so if we use P of t to represent
16514880	16521880	the population, so for example, if I have a bacteria population that is growing according
16535080	16542080	to the function, P of t is equal to X cubed. So if I have a bacteria population that is
16544880	16551880	cubed minus 18 X squared plus 96 X plus 20, where t is in hours, when is the population
16551880	16558880	growing and shrinking. And so if we use P of t to represent the population at time t,
16582880	16587040	we want to know when it's growing and shrinking, we're talking about the derivative. We're
16587040	16593880	talking about the change. So the change in the population, P prime of t, the derivative
16593880	16600880	of that function is 3 X squared minus 36 X plus 96. And where the change happens between
16604440	16610520	growth and shrinking, growth the derivative is positive because it's going up. Shrinking
16610520	16616840	the derivative is negative, it's going down. So it changes when the derivative is equal
16616840	16623840	to zero. So zero equals 3 X squared minus 36 X plus 96. And we know we can solve this
16625640	16632640	by factoring. Factor out the GCF of 3 times X squared minus 12 X plus 32. Zero equals
16633360	16640360	3 times X minus 8 and X minus 4. I probably should have t's not X's because it's P of
16648240	16655240	t. I'll change to P of X then it works. P of X. So X is equal to 8 and 4 hours. So
16655880	16662880	at 8 and 4 things are changing. So if we got a timeline here, at 4 things change and at
16666320	16673320	8 things change. What is happening with P prime of X? What is happening to the derivative?
16674120	16681120	Are we increasing or decreasing? Is the derivative positive or negative? So again we'll go to
16681120	16688120	our calculator, hit Y equals, clear out these other formulas, and our population is changing
16688520	16695520	according to 3 X squared minus 36 X plus 96. And if we hit second table, we can try out
16701680	16708180	a few values for time and see if this is, the derivative is positive or negative. If
16708260	16714060	it's positive it's increasing. If it's negative it's decreasing. Between 0 and 4 we'll try
16714060	16721060	2. We see it's positive. Between 4 and 8 we'll try 5. Negative. Bigger than 8, 9. It's positive.
16725260	16732260	So it goes positive, negative, positive. Positive, negative, positive. So what that means is
16733000	16740000	the population is growing wherever the derivative is positive. Between 0 and 4 hours, union,
16744260	16751260	and then from 8 to infinite hours it's never going to stop growing. And it's shrinking in
16751900	16758900	between 4 and 8 hours because the derivative is negative. So we're talking about population,
16758900	16765900	business, and physics with velocity and acceleration. A couple key applications of the derivative. We'll
16765900	16769780	talk about more as the course develops, but that's enough to get you going for now. We
16769780	16776780	will see you in class to dive into these a little bit deeper. Up until now we've avoided
16778780	16783420	really talking about trigonometric functions and the derivatives. So today we're going
16784100	16791100	to attempt to answer the question of what are the derivatives of the trig functions,
16801460	16808460	sine, cosine, tangent, and also the less used ones of cosecant, secant, and cotangent.
16808920	16815920	And to begin setting this up we're going to look at the graph of f of x equals sine x.
16818340	16825340	And you'll remember from your days of trigonometry it has a maximum of 1 and a minimum at negative
16825340	16832340	1. And then at pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over 2, and 2 pi, things get excited. So we're going
16839140	16846140	to go in the other direction, same thing, negative pi over 2, negative pi, negative 3 pi over
16846140	16853140	2, and negative 2 pi. And if you remember the sine of x starts at 0, it reaches a maximum
16855180	16862180	at pi over 2, back to 0, minimum at 3 pi over 2, and back to 0, doing kind of the same
16863180	16870180	exact thing in the opposite direction when we are on the other side. So the sine of x
16871580	16878580	is this familiar graph. If that's the sine of x, then what I want to graph next to it
16884820	16891820	is see if we can graph the derivative of the sine of x.
16892460	16899460	Using kind of the same scale we had before with pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over 2, 2 pi, negative
16904740	16911740	pi over 2, negative pi, negative 3 pi over 2, and negative 2 pi. And what I want to
16912980	16919980	notice as we graph the derivative, f prime of x, as we graph the derivative I want to
16920580	16927580	notice first off where the derivative is 0. Notice the derivative is 0 at negative 3
16927580	16934580	pi over 2, it's 0 at negative pi over 2, it's 0 at positive pi over 2, and it's 0 at 3 pi
16937820	16944820	over 2. And also I want to notice it starts out increasing, starts out increasing, starts
16945740	16952740	out increasing from the negative 2 pi up to the 0. So that means it's going to start
16956260	16963260	positive down to our negative 3 pi over 2. Then it's decreasing, meaning our derivative
16963900	16970900	is negative up until it reaches pi over 2. Then we're going uphill and we're positive
16971260	16978260	again up until the graph equals pi over 2, then decreasing all the way until we equal
16981060	16988060	3 pi over 2, then increasing or positive all the way up to 2 pi. And so we end up with
16989540	16994000	this derivative graph, and what's interesting is this derivative graph should look familiar
16994000	17000840	to us. Notice at 0 it starts at 1 and it's got the same shape as our familiar cosine,
17001780	17008280	cosine of x function. So in other words what we've discovered here is that the derivative
17008280	17015280	of sine appears at least from the graph to be the cosine of x. Well let's take the derivative
17016720	17023720	of this graph, just a little too tall, want to have room for a label, and doing the same
17023880	17030880	thing now. Oops, let's try that again. Let's see if we get something else familiar when
17043600	17050200	we take the second derivative, f prime prime of x, or the derivative of cosine to see what
17050200	17057200	we end up with here. Let's label here we've got negative pi over 2, negative pi, negative
17057200	17064200	3 pi over 2, and negative 2 pi. Going the other direction we have pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over
17064320	17071320	2, and 2 pi. And again noticing where the derivative is 0 at negative 2 pi, it's 0 at
17072240	17079240	negative pi, it's 0 at 0, and it's 0 at pi, and again it's going to be 0 at 2 pi. But
17087360	17093960	this time the graph starts out decreasing, which means it has to start off negative.
17093960	17100960	So it's going to start off negative up until it reaches the negative pi. Then between the
17101440	17108440	zeroes it's increasing, so the derivative has to be positive until it reaches the 0, decreasing,
17110440	17116440	indicating the derivative is negative, and then increasing, indicating the derivative
17116440	17123440	is positive, up until the 0. Now what we might hope is that there's this relationship
17125200	17128520	that the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of cosine is sine, but that's
17128520	17134920	not quite the case because sine starts out increasing, this one starts out decreasing.
17134920	17141120	It's actually flipped over the x-axis from the sine graph. In other words this red graph
17141120	17148120	here is actually the graph of negative sine of x. And so really what we found is that
17150000	17157000	the derivative of the sine of x is equal to the cosine of x, and that the derivative
17158000	17165000	of the cosine of x turned out to be the negative sine of x, at least graphically. So can we
17169760	17176760	use that information then to learn what the derivative is of the tangent of x? Well what's
17178380	17185380	nice about the tangent is we know that tangent is actually the sine of x divided by the cosine.
17187420	17192980	Of x, we have that property from trig, which means really all we have to do is use the
17192980	17199980	quotient rule. The derivative of sine, we said was cosine x, times the denominator, cosine
17201300	17208300	x, minus the derivative of the denominator, the derivative of cosine is negative sine,
17209380	17215880	negative negative makes it positive, times the numerator which is the sine of x, all
17215900	17222900	over the denominator, squared. So what we have really is cosine squared of x, plus sine
17227020	17234020	squared of x, all over cosine squared of x, but that numerator should look really familiar
17236220	17243220	to us. We should recognize from our trig days that sine squared plus cosine squared is
17243540	17250540	one. So we have one over cosine squared of x, but cosine is just the reciprocal of secant,
17254080	17261080	and so we end up with secant squared of x. The derivative of tangent is secant squared.
17266640	17269920	Well similar to what we just did with the tangent of x and using the quotient rule,
17269940	17276940	we can work our way through all the other trig derivatives, so similarly we complete all
17284220	17291220	the trig derivatives. In fact, the remaining three are left to a homework assignment, but
17292220	17299220	here they are in their properties. The derivative of the sine of x is equal to the cosine of x,
17306860	17313860	the derivative of the cosine of x is the negative sine of x, the derivative of the tangent
17314180	17321180	of x is the secant squared of x. Those are the ones we just played with, but the other
17323420	17327920	three which are left to an exercise in the homework, the derivative of the secant of
17327920	17334920	x, turns out to be the secant of x times the tangent of x, the derivative of the reciprocal
17335280	17342280	of cosine, or the derivative of the reciprocal of sine, which is cosecant of x, is negative
17350100	17357100	cosecant of x, cotangent of x, and the derivative of the cotangent of x is equal to negative
17357220	17364220	cosecant squared of x. These six trig identities, at least sine and cosine you should have memorized,
17374660	17381660	but ultimately we're going to have to be able to use all six of these trig derivatives.
17387540	17394540	Six important formulas for us to learn. That's what we're going to focus on today. Actually
17397300	17401380	that's all there is that's new. We can just combine all of this with things like our
17401380	17408380	product rule, our quotient rule, our polynomial rules, and calculate a whole bunch of derivatives.
17408780	17415780	So let's see if we can use these in a couple examples.
17417700	17424700	First we're going to look at f of x equals three x to the fourth sine of x plus seven
17428700	17435700	over x. Now one thing you might notice is that seven over x we can rewrite. So let's
17436420	17443100	rewrite it as three x to the fourth sine x plus seven x to the negative one so we can
17443100	17450100	use our polynomial formulas. And then we'll start calculating the derivative of f of x.
17453340	17457540	First thing I notice is we really have a product rule to start us off. We've got three x to
17457540	17463780	the fourth times the sine of x. So to do the product rule we take the derivative of the
17463780	17470780	first which is twelve x cubed times the second sine of x plus the derivative of the second
17474060	17479660	the derivative of sine is cosine x times the first and I'll just put it in front to make
17479660	17486660	it obvious that it's not inside the cosine. And then after the product rule we still have
17486660	17492100	to take care of the plus seven x to the negative one. Seven times negative one is negative seven
17492100	17499100	x to the negative two and we've got our derivative. Let's try another one that might be a little
17499620	17506620	more involved. Let's say f of x is equal to the cosine of x minus x to the fifth times
17509780	17516780	the cotangent of x plus the secant of x. Now it should be clear here we're working with
17517540	17524540	a product. Two pieces multiplied together so we have to do the product rule for f prime
17529980	17536180	of x for the derivative. So we'll take the derivative of the first term or the first
17536180	17543180	factor. The derivative of cosine x is negative sine x minus x to the fifth becomes five
17543380	17550380	x to the fourth times the second cotangent x plus secant of x plus the derivative of
17557780	17564780	the second. The derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared of x plus the derivative
17564780	17571780	of secant is secant x tangent x and then we have to multiply by the first part, the cosine
17581020	17588020	x minus x to the fifth. And we've got our derivative. One more for this video.
17595500	17602500	f of x is equal to tangent of x minus three x to the fourth over cosecant of x minus seven.
17612940	17619940	Now we're dividing two functions. With division we know we need to use the quotient rule just
17620780	17627780	like we always have before. The quotient rule says we take the derivative of the top. The
17628180	17635180	derivative of tangent we now know is secant squared of x minus three times four is twelve
17636300	17643300	x cubed. The derivative of the top times the bottom cosecant x minus seven minus the derivative
17643780	17650780	of the bottom. The derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant, so a negative negative
17655020	17662020	makes it positive, cosecant x cotangent x times the numerator times the first part. Tangent
17662020	17669020	x minus three x to the fourth. And that's all over the denominator squared, cosecant
17679100	17686100	x minus seven squared. So today's video is really short because there's not a lot of
17686820	17693820	new stuff to add. All we have now is we've added the six trig derivatives, and then we
17694220	17699220	kind of tie them into all the other derivative rules that we've seen before. The quotient
17699220	17705220	rule, the product rule, the polynomial rules, and just continue to practice taking these
17705220	17711220	important derivatives. With calculus and derivatives, practice, practice, practice is the key until
17712140	17719140	you can do these derivatives in your sleep. So go ahead and try some of these off the
17719420	17724140	homework assignment. This video is shorter to give you more time to get into the practice,
17724140	17731140	and we'll dive into these more in class. I'll look forward to seeing you then.
17732340	17736780	Quite often when we're trying to find the derivative of a function, we find that we
17736820	17743820	actually have a composite function, or a function inside a function. And so that's the question
17743820	17750820	we're going to address today is how do we take a derivative of a composite function?
17767540	17774540	A function inside of a function. And really the short answer to that is we use something
17778340	17785340	that is called the chain rule, which officially is written that the derivative of a function
17789460	17796460	with another function inside it is equal to the derivative of the outside function, which
17796780	17803780	is where the inside stays the same. Actually, I should use square brackets there, times
17804980	17811980	the derivative of the inside function. So in words, it's probably easier to remember
17812740	17819740	the chain rule is we take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the outside
17827780	17834780	of the inside. And that's what we're going to take a look at today. I've got seven examples
17837300	17841460	where we basically do this process over and over again. We take the derivative of the
17841460	17848460	outside times the derivative of the inside. But this chain rule is one that you should
17848980	17855980	be very comfortable with completing, working through, in order to take derivatives. So
17857420	17864420	let's take a look at some examples where we take the derivative of the outside times the
17871500	17878500	derivative of the inside. Let's say we've got a function f of x equals one over 4x minus
17878700	17885700	seven cubed. Now one thing I notice with this to make it easier to remember is that
17886780	17890260	it's really easier to take the derivative. We could use the quotient rule, but that's
17890260	17895140	just way too much work for what we need to do, because we've just got a one in the numerator.
17895140	17900900	This is really 4x minus seven with a negative three exponent, because the negative exponent
17900900	17907900	makes it a reciprocal one over that. So what we see we've actually got here is the 4x
17908900	17915900	minus three as a block is all raised to the negative three power. If this was just x to
17924460	17931060	the negative three, we know the derivative of that is negative three x to the negative
17931060	17937340	four. So that's kind of what we're going to do here, but we're going to use the 4x minus
17937340	17944340	seven in place of that x. So we pull the exponent out front, and f prime of x is equal to negative
17950100	17957100	three times the base, the 4x minus seven, all to the negative four power. Now the only
17957380	17964380	thing we have to do is multiply by the derivative of the inside, and the derivative of 4x minus
17964580	17971580	seven is just four. We'll clean that up a bit. Let's see the negative three times four
17977260	17982260	is negative twelve, so we've got negative twelve times 4x minus seven to the negative
17982260	17989260	four power as our final derivative. But the idea here is we identified that we've got
17990940	17997940	that 4x minus seven inside another function, which is the x to the negative three. So we
17999220	18006220	took the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside. So let's look at
18007140	18014140	another one. Let's say we had f of x equals the square root of 3x squared minus seven
18016020	18023020	x plus one. Now again, we recognize square root is really an exponent. We've really got
18025420	18032420	3x squared minus 7x plus one to the one half power. And so what we need to recognize here
18032420	18039420	is we have a function inside of a function. What we really have is the 3x squared minus
18041260	18048260	7x plus one, that function sitting inside a one half power. In other words, this is kind
18049780	18054820	of the same idea as if we had x to the one half power. We know how to take the derivative
18054820	18060820	of x to the one half power, that's one half x to the negative one half, bringing the x
18060820	18066460	exponent out front and then reducing the exponent by one. The only difference is instead of
18066460	18073460	having an x, we're going to have the 3x squared minus 7x plus one. So our derivative is we
18078100	18085100	pull the exponent out front, it's one half times the stuff, 3x squared minus 7x plus
18085580	18092580	one, and then we reduce the exponent by one, giving us negative one half. The only thing
18094260	18101260	we have to do in addition is multiply by the derivative of what's inside. The derivative
18102620	18109620	of 3x squared minus 7x plus one is 6x minus seven, and there we have our final answer.
18110620	18115220	The only thing we might want to do is clean up a bit because we've got that negative
18115220	18121580	exponent in a fraction going on. I'll leave the 6x minus seven in the numerator, the two
18121580	18128580	is in a denominator, and the 3x squared minus 7x plus one with the negative exponent moves
18128940	18135100	down. That just cleans it up, it's not really a needed step, but it does make it a little
18135100	18142100	prettier. But now we have our derivative. Let's try to increase in complexity a little
18144820	18151820	bit as we continue working through these problems. Let's go to a trig problem. What if we have
18153220	18160220	f of x equals the cosine of 5x squared? What if we have the cosine of 5x squared?
18165300	18172300	With this one, what you notice is we have got the 5x squared sitting inside of a cosine.
18176660	18183660	So we'll take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside. The derivative
18184460	18191460	of cosine is, let's mark this as f prime of x equals, the derivative of cosine is negative
18192380	18199380	sine of the stuff, 5x squared, and then we multiply by the derivative of the inside,
18203420	18210420	which is 10x. Clean this up a little bit and we'll move the 10x to the front so we just
18212260	18219260	see negative 10x sine of 5x squared, and we've got r.
18222060	18229060	The derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside. What about this one? f of x
18235940	18242940	equals secant squared of x. What's the outside and what's the inside function?
18242940	18249940	Another way to think about secant squared of x is, that's really secant of x squared.
18250940	18257940	So actually our inside function is the secant of x. The outside function is that we're squaring
18259220	18266220	it. So we're going to take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside
18266820	18273820	the outside function is that we're squaring it. So if we're squaring it, we know we bring
18276500	18283500	for f prime of x, we bring the exponent out front, and then reduce the exponent by 1.
18287060	18294060	And we multiply by the derivative of the inside. The derivative of secant is secant
18295060	18302060	tangent. Just to clean this up a bit, secant times secant is secant squared. So we have
18305660	18312660	two secant squared x tangent x. And we've got r derivative. And then we're going to
18324660	18331660	try another one. How about if we had f of x is equal to cosecant of 3x squared minus
18340620	18347620	5x? Again, we've got a function inside of a function. Identifying what's inside of
18354060	18361060	the inside is the 3x squared minus 5x. So we'll take the derivative of the outside times
18363820	18370820	the derivative of the inside. And the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent.
18372340	18379340	So we have f prime of x equals negative cosecant of the stuff 3x squared minus 5x times the
18384060	18391060	cotangent of the stuff 3x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside. Well
18396060	18403060	the derivative of the inside using our power rule is 6x minus 5. There's not much to clean
18407340	18412980	up on this one. The only thing we might be able to do is move the 6x minus 5 to the front
18413000	18419500	so it's really clear that that part is not part of the cotangent or cosecant. So we have
18419500	18426500	negative 6x minus 5, don't lose the parenthesis, cosecant of 3x squared minus 5, cotangent
18429420	18436420	of 3x squared minus 5. And we've found r derivative. And we've found r derivative.
18443980	18450980	To make these a little more exciting, we can combine different rules together to find derivatives.
18455020	18462020	Number 6 is an example of this, where we have f of x equals 4x plus 5 cubed times 2x squared
18465020	18472020	minus 6x plus 1 to the seventh power. This one is a little bit more complicated.
18472980	18479980	This problem is going to combine the chain rule along with the product rule. So we see
18482100	18489100	we're working with a product, but the product is of functions within functions. On the
18490020	18497020	left side we see 4x plus 5 is inside the cube function. On the right side we see 2x squared
18498020	18505020	minus 6x plus 1 is inside the seventh power function. So let's use our product rule along
18515540	18522540	with our chain rule in order to find the derivative. The product rule says we take the derivative
18523540	18529740	of the first part times the second part. So the derivative of the first part, we bring
18529740	18536740	the exponent out front, 3 times 4x plus 5, reduce the exponent by 1, so it's squared.
18539540	18546540	And then we multiply by the derivative of the inside, which is just 4. Then that's the
18547060	18554060	derivative of the first part, we still need to multiply by the second part, 2x squared
18555820	18562820	minus 6x plus 1 to the seventh power. Plus, now the product rule says we take the derivative
18567840	18574840	of the second part times the first part. The second part is a chain rule again, we bring
18575000	18582000	the 7 out front times 2x squared minus 6x plus 1. Now to the sixth power, because we've
18583960	18590960	reduced the exponent by 1, times the derivative of the inside. The inside has a derivative
18593080	18600080	of 4x minus 6, and that part is the derivative of the second part. We still have to multiply
18605480	18612480	by the first part, which is 4x plus 5, cubed. From here, there's just a little bit of cleanup.
18616880	18623880	I'm going to multiply 3 times 4 to get 12 times 4x plus 5 squared times 2x squared minus
18625760	18632760	6x plus 1 to the seventh power. The second part doesn't really have any cleanup to do,
18635160	18642160	so we'll just keep that all the same, 7 times 2x squared minus 6x plus 1 to the sixth power
18642240	18649240	times 4x minus 6 times 4x plus 5 cubed. That big ugly thing is the derivative of our function.
18649240	18656240	Notice to get that derivative, we had to combine both the chain rule and the product rule.
18664960	18670320	We knew the product rule was the derivative of the first times the second, plus the derivative
18670320	18676200	of the second times the first, but in order to take those derivatives in each of those
18676200	18682560	parts, we had to use the chain rule, where we took the derivative of the outside times
18682560	18689560	the derivative of the inside. We not only can combine the chain rule with other rules,
18694680	18701680	we can combine the chain rule with the chain rule. If we've got functions inside of functions,
18702200	18708700	we can just keep applying the chain rule, taking the derivative of the outside times the derivative
18708700	18713940	of the inside, times the derivative of what's inside that, times the derivative of what's
18713940	18720940	inside that, until we run out of things to take the derivative of. For our final example,
18723600	18730600	if f of x is equal to the tangent cubed of 5x squared minus 7 times the derivative of
18732560	18739560	x, what you'll see we have here, and maybe we should rewrite, remember tangent cubed
18740320	18747320	means we really have the tangent of 5x squared minus 7 to the third power. So we've got
18752580	18759580	a tangent inside of cubed, but then we've also got a 5x squared minus 7 times the derivative
18761960	18767480	of 7 inside of the tangent, and those colors are overlapping, making it very difficult
18767480	18774480	to see, but you get the idea. So we're going to first take the derivative of the outside
18778320	18785320	function, which is cubed. So for the derivative of a cubed, we pull the 3 outside, and reduce
18785320	18792320	the exponent by 1, now it's tangent squared of 5x squared minus 7. Then we take the derivative
18799980	18806980	of the inside, well the derivative of tangent is the secant squared of the inside stuff,
18806980	18813980	5x squared minus 7. But we're still not done, because we can take the derivative of the
18818620	18825620	inside stuff, which is going to be the 5x squared minus 7, the derivative of that is
18825780	18832780	just 10x. Cleaning up a little bit, 3 times 10 is 30, so f prime of x is equal to the
18837580	18844580	30x tangent squared of 5x squared minus 7 times secant squared of 5x squared minus 7.
18851940	18858940	And now we've got our derivative, which required us to use the chain rule on the chain rule,
18859940	18866940	which all we do is just start peeling off layers, like peeling the layers off an onion,
18866940	18872300	derivative of the outside, times the derivative of what's in that, times the derivative of
18872300	18879300	what's in that, times the derivative of what's in that, until we finally reach the end.
18880020	18884620	So that's the chain rule, the chain rule is we just keep taking derivatives and multiplying
18884620	18890780	until we reach the far inside of our function. This video is a little bit shorter because
18890780	18896940	it's going to give you time to practice this on your own before you come to class, and
18896940	18901300	then we'll dive into it a little deeper in class and answer any questions. I'll look
18901300	18908300	forward to seeing you then, so that we can work on the chain rule.
18909900	18914420	As we continue to work with derivatives, we want to continue to expand the types of functions
18914420	18918900	we can take the derivative of, and there's another one that we've missed, and that is
18918900	18925900	the inverse trig functions. So the question we're going to answer is what are the derivatives
18932620	18939620	of the inverse trig functions?
18940500	18947500	And before we can actually answer the question about what are the derivatives of the inverse
18948060	18955060	trig functions, we really have to understand how derivatives of inverses work.
18961980	18968980	And there's a nice little theorem that says that if f inverse of x is equal to x, then
18969620	18976620	is the inverse of f of x, then the derivative of f inverse at x is simply the reciprocal
18989020	18996020	of the derivative at that inverse point. Maybe a better way to say that is the inverse
18999620	19006620	point is to say that that's not so mathematical is if a comma b is a point on f of x, then
19015300	19022300	the slope of the tangent line,
19030500	19037500	is f prime of a. We stick that x coordinate into the derivative. We already know that
19037700	19041980	though, that's just our basic definition of the slope of a tangent line that we've been
19041980	19048980	working with thus far. So if a b is a point on f of x, then b comma a, switching the x
19050900	19057900	and y coordinates, is on f inverse of x, and the slope is on f inverse of x, and the slope
19059620	19066620	of the tangent line is, and it turns out to be, just the reciprocal of the slope of the
19074020	19081020	standard function. So the slope of the inverse is the reciprocal of the slope of the function.
19081300	19088300	We'll say 1 over f prime of a, and that's probably an important slope of the slope of
19089820	19096820	the slope to know 1 over the derivative at that point. So let's take a look at how we
19099020	19106020	can do some of these reciprocals of slopes or derivatives to calculate some tangent lines
19110740	19117740	on inverse functions. So for example, we're going to find the equation for the slope of
19119620	19127040	a tangent line of the inverse of f of x equals x cubed minus 7x plus 5 at 5.
19150620	19157620	So we're going to break this down into three parts. First, it's really important as we're
19161580	19167900	talking about this, we keep track of our five, is that the x coordinate or the y coordinate
19167900	19172260	of the function or of the inverse, because the function and the inverse have the same
19172260	19176420	x and y coordinates, they're just switched and backwards, and it's really easy to get
19176420	19183420	those confused. So let's take a moment to really clearly say that 5 is the x coordinate
19185140	19192140	of the inverse. We're finding the equation of the tangent line of the inverse at 5. So
19196380	19203380	5 is the x coordinate of the inverse, which means it is the y or the f of x for the ratio
19206660	19213660	function. Maybe I should say y for the f of x. So it's the x of the inverse and it's
19214580	19221580	the y for the function, which means we need to still find the other coordinate, the x
19225700	19232700	of the f of x. So if f of x is x cubed minus 7x plus 5, then we're going to find the x
19236420	19243420	of 5, and 5 is that y coordinate, this is like saying it equals 5. And we can solve this
19245940	19252940	really quickly for x. We'll subtract 5 from both sides to make it equal to 0, x cubed
19253140	19260140	minus 7x equals 0, factoring out the x from both sides, and then subtracting out the x
19267420	19274420	of both terms, we get x squared minus 7 equals 0. Let's scroll down a little more here, give
19277380	19283380	me some more space. And we'll set each factor equal to 0, so x equals 0, and x squared minus
19283380	19290380	7 equals 0. So x is equal to plus or minus the square root of 7. So we've got three
19290580	19297580	possible values for our x coordinate to make the y coordinate 5, 0, square root of 7, or
19299660	19306660	negative square root of 7. In fact, let's clearly state that on f of x, the point we're
19310420	19317420	talking about is 0, 5, square root of 7, 5, and negative square root of 7, 5, and negative
19317420	19324420	square root of 7, 5. We've got three points, which means on the inverse, we're talking
19326180	19333180	about the opposites, 5, 0, 5, square root of 7, and 5, negative square root of 7. Keeping
19335340	19342340	track of what's x, what's y on which function. Probably the most challenging part of this
19343340	19349820	section is keeping track of what is what. Next thing we're ready to do is, now that we
19349820	19354620	know what our x and y coordinates are that we're working with, we still need to find
19354620	19361620	the slope of the tangent line of f of x, because we know that the slope of the tangent line
19362020	19369020	of the inverse is just the reciprocal of this slope. Just because it's off my screen,
19370020	19377020	I'm going to write the function again x cubed minus 7x plus 5, so that we can take the derivative
19378140	19385140	at 3x squared minus 7. We need to find the slope at each of the three points, at each
19385140	19392140	of the three x coordinates that we just found. We're going to find f prime of 0, f prime
19398980	19405980	of the square root of 7, and f prime of negative square root of 7. We're going to have 3 because
19406020	19409680	we're dealing with three points. I think the homework assignment specifies a specific
19409680	19414600	range, so you're only doing one of the points, but the process is the same. Let's take the
19414620	19420500	extra practice. First, plugging 0 into the derivative, we have 3 times 0 squared minus
19420500	19427500	7, and that's just going to equal negative 7. Plugging square root of 7 in, we've got
19429240	19436240	3 times the square root of 7 squared minus 7. That's 3 times 7, or 21 minus 7, and that's
19437080	19443200	equal to 14. Really similar with the negative square root of 7, because squaring a negative
19443200	19450200	is the same as squaring the positive, so we've got 3 times 7, or 21 minus 7 is 14. Now we can make the equations of the tangent line.
19473200	19480200	Remember, with f inverse, we have to switch coordinates, because x is y and y is x on the inverse. We
19495320	19502320	also have to do the reciprocal slopes. We're going to have to do the reciprocal slope.
19503640	19510640	For our first point, let's see if I can get the points on the screen here. On the inverse,
19513460	19520460	the first point was 5 comma 0, and at that point we found the slope was equal to negative
19521500	19528500	1 seventh, the reciprocal of the negative 7. We have y equals negative 1 seventh times
19529100	19536100	x minus 5 plus the 0. That's the equation of the tangent line at 5-0. What if we wanted
19541060	19547060	to do it at 5 square root of 7? Actually, let's do this in a different color, just to
19547060	19553020	keep the different colors separate. Second point was 5 square root of 7. There the slope
19553020	19560020	is the reciprocal of 14, or 1 over 14. We have y equals 1 14th times x minus 5 plus
19564300	19571300	the square root of 7. We had a third point. Our third point was at 5 comma negative square
19574220	19581220	root of 7. That slope is going to be the reciprocal of 14, which is 1 over 14. For that equation,
19583340	19590340	we've got y equals 1 14th times x minus 5 minus the square root of 7.
19593420	19599300	Now we've got our three tangent lines that are tangent at an x coordinate of 5 to paint
19599300	19603380	on the y coordinate, because this inverse isn't actually a function. We probably should
19603380	19608100	have restricted the domain, but it provided us the chance to practice three times with
19608180	19615180	this process of finding the slope of the tangent line to the function, knowing the inverse
19616900	19623900	is the reciprocal slope. Let's try one more example that uses this idea before we get
19624740	19631740	to trig. How about this example? The point 4 comma 1 is 4 comma 1 minus 4 over 4.
19638240	19649240	It is on the inverse of f of x equals x to the 5th minus 3x squared plus 4 squared.
19649240	19656380	Find the equation of the tangent line. We know that the tangent line is going to have
19679540	19686540	the reciprocal slope of the function's tangent line slope. Let's find the function's tangent
19687040	19692160	line slope, f prime of x equals, this is a chain rule here. We'll take the derivative
19692160	19699160	of the outside, which is 2 times x to the 5th minus 3x squared plus 4 times the derivative
19699920	19706920	of the inside, which is 5x to the 4th minus 6x. Remember, 4 1 is on the inverse of x
19709240	19716240	to the 5th minus 6x. The point we want that's on the standard function before the inverse
19717160	19724160	is actually reversed. It's actually 1 comma 4. We want to make our x equal to 1 because
19724760	19731760	we're dealing with the standard function, not its inverse. F prime of 1 is equal to 2 times
19732040	19739040	1 to the 5th minus 3 times 1 squared plus 4 times 5 times 1 to the 4th minus 5 times
19739640	19746640	6 times 1. Maybe use a calculator to do that real quick.
19749600	19754080	1 is nice because it's not going to do anything exciting when we multiply it or when we do
19754080	19761080	exponents with it. We've got 2 times 1 to the 5th, which is just 1 minus 3 times 1 squared,
19761480	19768080	which is just 3 plus 4. Close the parentheses, then we have 5 times 1 to the 4th, which is
19768080	19775080	just 5 minus 6 times 1, which is just 6. We get this nice slope of negative 4.
19784880	19791880	If that's the slope of the function at 1, the slope at the inverse, at the alternative
19792320	19799320	coordinates, the slope of the inverse that we're going for is negative 1 fourth, and
19801440	19807360	the point we're working with is 4 comma 1. We just go straight to our equation, y equals
19807360	19814360	negative 1 fourth times x minus 4 plus 1. That's going to go through the point 4, 1.
19814880	19821880	It's on the inverse of its tangent to the inverse of our function.
19828240	19832040	But the original question that we're dealing with had to do with the inverse of the trig
19832040	19838760	functions, so we haven't touched any trig functions yet. Let's see if we can use what
19838840	19845840	we've just learned about inverses to find the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.
19853880	19860880	To set this up, I want to consider f of x equals sine x. If we want the inverse of
19860880	19867880	sine x, we remember from our trig days, we call that just the sine inverse of x, and
19869080	19876080	it's really important to note that that negative 1 is not an exponent. It's not an exponent.
19878640	19885640	That doesn't mean sine to the negative 1 power. That means the inverse sine of x. It might
19886640	19893640	be called the arc sine of x. Using what we know, then what we know about inverses is
19896760	19901960	we can find the derivative of the inverse using the derivative of the standard function.
19901960	19908760	The derivative of the standard function, f prime of x, the derivative of sine is cosine
19908760	19915760	of x. And we know that the derivative of an inverse is equal to 1 over the derivative
19926100	19933100	of the functions inverse. So in our case, that's going to be 1 over f prime. The derivative
19934080	19941080	is cosine of the inverse function, which is sine inverse of x. And if we think back to
19951140	19957640	our trig days, we remember to find sine inverse of x. We say, hey, well, we've got a triangle,
19957640	19964440	cosine of the sine inverse. We've got a triangle. We like to make the radius equal to 1. And
19964440	19971440	we want the sine inverse of x. So sine inverse of x. So we're talking about x. So the opposite
19974760	19981760	over the hypotenuse is the sine. Opposite over the hypotenuse is x. So x over 1 is x.
19982760	19988840	And then using the Pythagorean theorem, the other side has to be 1 minus x squared, the
19988840	19995840	square root of all of that. So that's our triangle for the sine inverse of x. We want
19997760	20004760	to take the cosine of that. And cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. The adjacent over
20005760	20011760	the hypotenuse, in this case, is the square root over 1, which is just the square root.
20011760	20018760	And so we end up with 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared. 1 over the square root
20024560	20031560	of 1 minus x squared, then, is the derivative of the inverse sine. And so we end up with
20035480	20042480	using this exact same process, we can actually find the derivative of all the inverse sine
20044200	20051200	function, or inverse trig functions. So similarly, we get the derivatives of the inverse trig
20051200	20058200	functions. We get the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. Six inverse trig functions.
20073920	20080840	The derivative of sine inverse of x, we just found out that that was 1 over the square
20080880	20087880	root of 1 minus x squared. Similarly, the derivative of cosine inverse of x turns out
20092120	20099120	to be negative 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared. And the derivative of tangent
20101920	20108920	inverse of x, using the same process, will be 1 over 1 plus x squared. And so we get
20111320	20118320	and then we can find the derivative of the reciprocals. The reciprocal of sine is cosecant.
20119920	20126120	Its derivative is negative 1 over the absolute value of x times the square root of x squared
20126120	20133120	minus 1. The derivative of secant inverse of x is 1 over the absolute value of x times
20134100	20141100	the square root of x squared minus 1. And the derivative of cotangent inverse of x is
20151400	20158400	negative 1 over 1 plus x squared. So you've got six more important derivatives.
20164120	20171120	To add to your list of derivatives. Nice part about these is if you know your trig
20173760	20177440	well enough, you should be able to derive them all using our inverse formula that we
20177440	20184440	just found. Or you can memorize them, which comes quite naturally out of just trying a
20185880	20191980	few of these over and over again in practice. So let's do just that. Let's do two examples
20191980	20198980	where we're finding the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. Let's say f of x equals
20205140	20212140	the cosine inverse of x squared. We're dealing with a chain rule here. We've got x squared
20212140	20219140	inside the cosine inverse. So let's see how that comes out. The derivative of cosine inverse
20219540	20226540	is negative 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared. But x squared is in there, so we've
20228540	20235540	got x squared squared. x squared squared is x to the fourth. Knowing that we multiply
20235540	20242540	those exponents times the derivative of the inside. The derivative of x squared is 2x.
20243540	20250540	And since that's really 2x over 1, we can simplify to get negative 2x over the square
20250860	20257860	root of 1 minus x to the fourth. So we've got x squared times the derivative of x squared
20266540	20273540	Let's try another one. Let's say f of x equals the square root of x times the secant inverse
20279420	20286420	of x. By this point in our study of calculus, when we see that square root of x, we should
20286420	20293420	immediately know to change that to x to the one half power so that we can use our exponent
20293780	20300780	properties. So we have x to the one half secant inverse of x. And let's start taking the derivative
20302460	20308460	using the product rule because we're dealing with a product. So the derivative of the first
20308820	20315820	is one half times x to the negative one half times the second, which is secant inverse
20317140	20324140	of x. Plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative of secant inverse is 1 over
20326100	20332600	the absolute value of x times the square root of x squared minus 1. So we're going to
20332600	20339600	use 1 over the absolute value of x times the square root of x squared minus 1 times the
20341000	20348000	first, which is x to the one half. Let's clean that up a little bit. Let's go ahead
20349040	20355040	and use our negative exponents. The one half means we've got a 2 in the denominator, x
20355040	20360280	to the one half sticks the square root of x in the denominator. Now be careful with secant
20360280	20365640	inverse. That is not secant to the negative one power. That is not a negative exponent.
20365640	20372240	That's an inverse trig function. So we'll put the secant inverse of x in the numerator.
20372240	20377740	Plus x to the one half, that's really the square root of x in the numerator. Absolute
20377740	20384740	value of x times the square root of x squared minus 1. And now we've got the derivative
20385120	20392120	of that function. So we did a little bit of work today with inverse functions, but the
20393200	20398200	big idea that I want you to be able to pull out of this lesson is how to take the derivative
20398200	20403700	of the inverse functions using these six derivative properties. We'll also do a little bit of
20403700	20409700	work with inverses in general, but the bulk is going to be here on the trig derivatives.
20410080	20417080	Practice a few of these. We will see you in class to dive into them a little bit deeper.
20417080	20423080	Now that we're able to use the chain rule in order to calculate more complex derivatives,
20423080	20429080	we are actually ready to answer a deeper question about finding derivatives. And that's for
20429080	20435080	finding derivatives around functions, or not functions, but relations between x and y that
20435280	20442580	are more complex than a function. This would include things like circles, ellipses, hyperbolas,
20442580	20449580	or more complex graphs and non-functions that do not pass the vertical line test. So the
20449880	20456880	question is going to be how do we take the derivative of x squared minus 1 over x squared
20465260	20472260	if it is not a function of x? In other words, it's going to fail the vertical line test.
20476400	20481060	It's not a function, and everything we've done thus far has been all predicated on the
20481060	20486820	idea of a function. And so what we're going to have to do is if it's not a function, we're
20486820	20493820	going to have to use what's called implicit differentiation. And so we're going to have
20495580	20502580	a function where y is a function of x, we don't know what it is, or it's too complex for
20507240	20514240	us to work with, and so we'll just take the derivative of y times the derivative of what's
20514900	20521900	inside it, and the derivative of y we know is just dy dx. So in summary, we can use the
20525080	20532080	chain rule with this idea that the derivative of y with respect to x is dy dx. But of course
20544020	20549840	dy dx is what we're trying to find. What is the derivative of y with respect to x? And
20549840	20556840	so what we will then do is we will then solve for dy dx, and generally dy dx will be a linear
20563520	20569520	function so we'll be able to get all the dy dx's on one side, factor out dy dx, and divide
20569520	20575200	by whatever it's multiplied by. But to get an idea of what this looks like, let's start
20575200	20582200	with a simple example. Just a basic circle with a radius of six has the equation x squared
20582800	20590300	plus y squared equals 36. And just kind of to draw a picture off to the side, we won't
20590300	20593460	normally do this, but just to get an idea of what we're talking about here is we've
20593460	20600460	got a circle with a radius of six, and the idea is that we could in theory calculate
20605200	20610720	we come up with a tangent line to this circle that touches at one point, and we could put
20610720	20617720	that tangent line anywhere on the circle. And so what we want to do is come up with
20617720	20624720	what is the equation of the slope of that tangent line? What is dy dx? But we can't
20624720	20629340	do it by our traditional means because this thing is not a function. It does not pass
20629340	20636080	the vertical line test because it's going to, a vertical line will cross the graph twice.
20636080	20641180	So because it doesn't pass the vertical line test, because it's not a function, we will
20641180	20646140	take the derivative implicitly, which means we're going to use this idea of the chain
20646140	20653140	rule whenever we come across the y. So first, the derivative of x squared is 2x, plus the
20653420	20660920	derivative of y squared. Now keep it in mind the chain rule, we're going to treat the y
20660920	20667920	like it's the inside stuff, and so the derivative of y squared is 2y, but we have to multiply
20670140	20677140	by the derivative of the inside, and the derivative of y is dy dx. Equals, we'll do the same thing
20677140	20684140	on the other side, the derivative of 36 is 0, and now I've got something that I can
20686020	20693020	solve for the dy dx. To solve for the dy dx, we'll subtract 2x from both sides, and we
20695540	20702540	have 2y dy dx equals negative 2x. Get the y by itself, or the dy dx, and we're going
20707140	20714140	to get dy dx by itself, by dividing by 2y, and we get negative 2x over 2y, or by reducing
20716300	20723300	out the 2s, we have dy dx is equal to negative x over y. So the slope of the tangent line
20727220	20734220	of this circle is negative x over y. We would then know from our point what x and y are,
20735220	20742220	and we'd be able to find the slope at any given point. Now that was a simple example.
20742780	20748780	These examples can quickly increase in complexity as we combine quotient rules and product rules
20748780	20755660	and chain rules and all the other rules we've seen. So let's try several of these examples.
20755660	20759660	We'll do two more examples where we're just solving for dy dx, and then we'll also look
20759780	20766280	at how we can find the equation of these tangent lines. So first we're going to look at x cubed
20766280	20773280	y squared minus the sine of x equals the tangent of y. To take the derivative implicitly,
20779620	20783780	because solving for y would be a headache, we'll take the derivative of the first part
20783780	20789820	here. We notice we've got a product, the x squared times the y squared, so we will use
20789820	20796820	the product rule. The derivative of x cubed is 3x squared times the second part, which
20796820	20803820	is y squared, plus the derivative of the second part, which is 2y dy dx, and I'll just put
20804900	20810180	that in parentheses so we can see what we're solving for, times the first part, which is
20810220	20817220	x cubed. Now that we've used the product rule, we keep going down our function. The derivative
20817940	20824940	of negative sine is negative cosine of x equals the derivative of tangent is secant square
20826740	20833340	of y, but times the derivative of the inside, whenever we take the derivative with the y,
20833420	20840420	we have to multiply by dy dx. Now we just have to solve for the dy dx. To do that, we're
20846020	20852020	going to get all the dy dx's on one side, so I'm going to move that 2y dy dx, that's
20852020	20858940	a terrible y, the 2y dy dx times x cubed, we're going to move that to the left side,
20858940	20865940	so we now have 3x squared, it should be green, 3x squared y squared minus the cosine of x
20869100	20876100	equals the secant squared of y times dy dx, minus 2y x cubed times the dy dx, and then
20876100	20883100	because the dy dx is on both terms, we're able to factor that out, dy dx times the secant
20883900	20890900	squared of y minus 2y x cubed, is still equal to, the other side's unchanged, 3x squared
20893060	20900060	y squared minus 2y x cubed, that's a terrible y, that's a terrible y, that's a terrible
20906140	20913140	cosine x. And so to get the dy dx alone, we just divide by everything, it's multiplied
20916220	20923060	by, and so now we can say that dy dx, the derivative or slope of the tangent line of
20923060	20930060	this relationship is 3x squared y squared minus cosine x divided by what was multiplied
20930980	20937980	by the dy dx, the secant squared y minus 2y x cubed, and that's how we can use this
20943740	20950060	idea of implicit differentiation, we just keep taking the derivative of both sides, and
20950060	20956340	then whenever we come across a y, we're going to multiply by the derivative of y using the
20956340	20963620	chain rule, which is dy dx. Let's look at another. Let's say we have xy plus x over y equals
20974140	20981140	y times the square root of 2x plus 1. One thing that's going to help us make this derivative
20986420	20993620	a little easier is the x over y, we can rewrite that y with a negative exponent, so we can
20993620	20998860	just use the product rule instead of the quotient rule, which is much simpler. Also the square
20998860	21003780	root, the easiest way to take a derivative with the square root is to change that to
21003780	21009700	a fractional exponent of 1 half, and then we can just use our exponent rules. So let's
21009700	21016700	rewrite this problem as xy plus xy to the negative 1 equals y times 2x plus 1 to the
21021020	21028020	1 half power. Now we're going to have to use several product rules here, so you want
21029300	21034660	to make sure you keep track of each part because we've got a product at the beginning, actually
21034660	21040340	let me do this in green so it stands out a little more. A product at the beginning,
21040340	21045180	a product in the middle, and a product at the end which is going to require us to use
21045180	21052180	the chain rule. So the first product, x times y, derivative of the first, the derivative
21052860	21059860	of x is 1 times y plus the derivative of the second, the derivative of y is dy dx times
21060860	21067860	the first, which is x, plus the derivative of x is 1 times the second, y to the negative
21072380	21079380	1 plus the derivative of the second, the derivative of y to the negative 1. We bring the negative
21079500	21086500	out front, so instead of plus we actually have minus y to the negative 2 times dy dx,
21090140	21097140	because we were taking a derivative with y times the first, which is x, equals, we have
21101260	21108260	another product. The derivative of the first part, the derivative of y is dy dx times the
21108620	21115620	second part, which is 2x plus 1 to the 1 half plus the derivative of the second part, which
21116220	21123220	is 1 half times 2x plus 1 to the negative 1 half. But now we have to use our chain rule
21127380	21134380	because the derivative of the 2x plus 1, the inside stuff, is 2. Now we can multiply
21136020	21143020	by the derivative, by the first part. Looking at this ugly thing that we have, a couple
21143220	21150140	of things to simplify, we've got a times 2 and a divide by 2, those are going to reduce
21150140	21156300	out, which is nice, so we don't have to deal with the fraction. Other than that, what we're
21156300	21163300	going to want to do is get all of these dy dx terms, there's one right here, dy dx times
21164740	21171740	x, we've got a negative y to the negative 2, dy dx times x, and we've also got x to
21173020	21180020	a dy dx multiplied by the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half. Let's move all the dy dx's to the
21183940	21190940	right and everything else to the left. So on the left we've still got the y plus y to
21192460	21199460	the negative 1, and then we'll subtract out that term at the end, the 2x plus 1 to the
21199820	21206820	negative 1 half times y, and I'm just going to put that y in front, equals, we've got
21213060	21220060	a dy dx multiplied by the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half. We have to also subtract off the dy
21221060	21228060	dx, which is multiplied by the x, and we're also going to add, to get rid of the minus,
21233900	21240900	a y to the negative 2x times dy dx. Now that we've got the dy dx's on the right,
21240900	21247900	the everything else on the left, we can factor out the dy dx, which leaves us with 2x plus
21258340	21265340	1 to the 1 half minus x plus y to the negative 2x. The other side's unchanged, y plus y
21270900	21277900	to the negative 1 minus y times 2x plus 1 to the negative 1 half. That's a terrible
21282020	21289020	2. There we go. And then finally we get the dy dx alone by dividing both sides by what
21289260	21296020	it's multiplied by, giving us y plus y to the negative 1 minus y times 2x plus 1 to the
21296020	21303020	negative 1 half, all over the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half, minus x plus y to the negative
21311860	21318860	2 times x. And now we have implicitly found that we've
21319020	21326020	found our derivative. Keeping along with this same idea, I want to add to it a little twist,
21331540	21338540	something we're very familiar with. And that is finding the equation of the tangent line.
21350020	21357020	So that equation of the tangent line, same idea, let's start with x cubed y plus 5x
21361940	21368940	squared y equals negative 28. And we're going to find the equation of the tangent line at
21368940	21375940	the point 2 comma negative 1. First we need to find the slope of the tangent line, and
21379020	21383780	then it's going to be really easy to find the actual equation. To find the slope we
21383780	21388620	take the derivative, we've got a couple products, we're getting really good at the product rule
21388620	21395620	here. So we've got 3x squared times y plus the derivative of y is dy dx times the x cubed
21401380	21408380	plus, for the second product, the derivative of the first part is 10x times the y plus
21409020	21416020	the derivative of the second, which is a dy dx times the first part, which is 5x squared
21417740	21424740	equals the derivative of negative 28 is just 0. Now solving for the dy dx's, they're all
21428220	21433420	on one side, which is nice, so we just need to get rid of the other stuff. So we've got
21433420	21440420	a dy dx times x cubed plus a dy dx times 5x squared is equal to negative 3x squared
21445740	21452740	y minus 10xy, moving those things without dy dx to the other side, so that we can factor
21455620	21462620	out the dy dx, leaving behind x cubed plus 5x squared plus 5x squared plus 5x squared
21463660	21470660	equals the negative 3x squared y minus 10xy. Now we can divide by what dy dx is multiplied
21476500	21483500	by, so we know that dy dx is equal to negative 3x squared y minus 10xy over the x cubed
21484500	21491500	plus 5x squared. We want that derivative at the point 2 comma negative 1, so we'll plug
21500500	21506500	2 in for all of these x's, we'll plug negative 1 in for the y's, so we have negative 3 times
21506500	21513500	x, which is 2 squared times y, which is negative 1, minus 10 times x, which is 2 times y, which
21515900	21522900	is negative 1, all over x cubed, x is 2 cubed plus 5x squared, which is 2 squared, and this
21527980	21534980	is not too bad to plug in to our handy dandy calculators. Let's just do the numerator and
21535980	21541980	the denominator, so it's a fraction and it looks kind of slope-esque. We've got negative
21541980	21548980	3 times 2 squared times negative 1 minus 10 times 2 times negative 1, so the numerator
21557540	21564540	is 32, over our denominator, which is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2
21565780	21572780	cubed plus 5 times 2 squared, which is 28. Both of those are divisible by 4, 32 divided
21579540	21586540	by 4 is 8 and 28 divided by 4 is 7, so 8 sevenths is equal to our slope at the point 2 comma
21586820	21593820	negative 1. So the equation of the tangent line, y equals m, my slope 8 sevenths times
21603100	21610100	x minus x1, which is 2, plus the y1, which is negative 1, the equation of our tangent
21611020	21618020	line, of this ugly function is 8 sevenths x minus 2 minus 1. Let's do one more example,
21624860	21631860	it's got a trig function in it. Number 2, cosine of x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x,
21640660	21647660	y equals y. And we're going to find the equation of the tangent line at pi over 3 comma 1.
21655780	21659620	We'll do this implicitly because it's almost impossible to solve for y, at least it would
21659620	21666620	be quite tedious. So the derivative of cosine is negative sine of x, y. Using the chain
21667620	21674620	rule, we multiply by the derivative of what's inside. We want to make sure we multiply by
21674620	21678620	the entire derivative, and because we have to use the product rule, there's going to
21678620	21685020	be a plus, so I'm going to put this in parentheses to remind me to distribute the negative sine
21685020	21692020	through the parentheses. The derivative of x is just 1 times the y, which is y, plus
21692520	21699520	the derivative of y is our dy dx times the x, and that's equal to the derivative of y,
21706300	21713300	which we know is dy dx. We want to solve for the dy dx, we first have to get it out of
21713540	21719540	the parentheses, so we're going to distribute that negative sine x, y through. That gives
21719540	21726540	us negative y sine of x, y minus x sine of x, y times dy dx equals dy dx. We want to get
21726540	21733540	the dy dx's all on the same side, so we'll add that x sine x y to both sides, giving
21747760	21754760	us negative y sine of x, y equals dy dx, y minus x sine of x, y minus x sine of x, y
21757540	21764540	plus x sine of x, y, dy dx. Once they're all on one side, we can factor out dy dx, leaving
21777500	21784500	behind a 1, don't forget the 1, it doesn't just disappear, plus x sine of x, y plus
21787540	21794540	y, still equal to negative y sine of x, y. Finally, to get the dy dx alone, we divide
21797660	21804160	both sides by what it's multiplied to get our final derivative, negative y sine of x,
21804160	21811160	y, divided by 1 plus x sine of x, y equals dy dx. We're going to divide both sides by
21817100	21824100	dy dx. We want the slope though, or we want the equation, at pi over 3 comma 1. Let's
21826100	21832600	plug that into our function. We got negative y, which is negative 1, times the sine of
21832600	21839600	x times y, 1 times pi over 3 is just pi over 3, all over 1 plus x, which is pi over 3,
21840600	21847600	times the sine of x, y, which is pi over 3. If we remember our unit circle, pi over
21855280	21862280	3, the y coordinate there is the square root of 3 over 2, so we have negative root 3 over
21862720	21869720	2, over 1 plus pi over 3 times, again the sine of pi over 3 is root 3 over 2. I don't
21877440	21884040	like having those fractions and fractions, so let's clear out those fractions and fractions.
21884040	21891040	We've got a common denominator of 6. I'm going to multiply by 6 and distribute that 6 through.
21891320	21898320	6 over 2 will reduce to 3, so we have negative 3 root 3 over 6 plus 3 times 2 is 6, which
21900760	21907760	will reduce to the 6, so that's pi root 3. It looks weird and ugly, but sure enough
21908960	21915960	it is our derivative. We have y equals our slope, which is negative 3 root 3, and we
21921480	21928480	have negative 3 root 3 over 6 plus pi root 3 times x minus the x coordinate, which is
21930160	21937160	pi over 3, plus our y coordinate, which is 1, and this is the equation of the line that
21938520	21945520	is tangent to cosine xy equals y. So that's implicit differentiation. The idea behind
21945960	21952960	implicit differentiation is that we just take the derivative of both sides of the equation.
21955280	21962280	Using the chain rule, knowing that the derivative of y is dy dx, because y is a function of
21962640	21968160	x, it's not just a variable, it is a function of x, so we use our chain rule and multiply
21968160	21975160	by the derivative of y. Then we just have to solve the resulting equation for dy dx.
21978680	21982760	Looking forward to seeing you in class when we can work on this a little bit more. Give
21982760	21988880	yourself some time to practice before then, and we'll see you in class.
21988880	21993480	There is one more set of functions that we haven't taken a look at how to find the derivative
21993480	22000480	of. So we're going to attempt to answer that question today, is how do we find the derivative
22008920	22015920	of exponential and logarithmic functions?
22024480	22030160	And we'll break that up into two halves once. We'll talk about the exponentials and then
22030160	22037160	we'll come back and talk about the logarithmic functions. So first, exponential functions.
22044120	22051120	Some important formulas that will help us take derivative. The nicest derivative formula
22051280	22057400	I have all, and it's also the most interesting, is that the derivative of e to the x, the slope
22057400	22064400	of the tangent line to e to the x at e to the x, is actually exactly e to the x. Which
22070040	22076880	is kind of weird when you think about it. But if our base is not e to the x, it turns
22076880	22083880	out the derivative of any base to the x is that base to the x times the natural log of
22086080	22093080	the base. Which just so happens that the natural log of e is just one, so we end up with two
22095200	22099680	formulas that could be condensed into one. But since we use e to the x so often, we'll
22099680	22104520	give it its own little formula. These two formulas are going to be what guide us here
22104520	22111520	as we go into the first part of this video. So let's take a look at some examples of taking
22114000	22121000	derivatives with exponentials. Let's say f of x equals e to the cosine of x squared.
22127480	22132320	What we really have here is just a really big chain rule problem. It's a three level
22132360	22138760	chain rule, but we can do that. F prime of x is equal to the derivative of the outside
22138760	22145760	and the derivative of e to the x is e to the stuff, e to the cosine of x squared times
22147320	22154320	the derivative of the inside stuff, and so the derivative of cosine is negative sign
22155280	22162280	of the stuff, times the derivative of the inside stuff. And the derivative of cosine
22162320	22171200	of x squared is just 2x. Cleaning this up a little bit, putting the negative and 2x
22171200	22179760	out front, we'll put the sine of x squared next, and then the e to the cosine of x squared
22179760	22186600	after that, just so that it looks a little nicer. But that way we found our derivative,
22186600	22194960	which contained in e to the x. We could even expand this into any of our rules or patterns
22194960	22202080	that we've seen thus far, so what if we did a quotient rule? f of x is equal to e to the
22202080	22213840	3x minus 7 all over x squared plus 5x. Well, we should be very comfortable with the quotient
22213840	22220280	rule by now, so we take the derivative of the top, which is e to the 3x minus 7, because
22220280	22226240	the derivative of e to something is e to that something. But we have to multiply by the
22226240	22234560	derivative of the inside, which is just 3, and then we have to multiply by the denominator
22234760	22245520	x squared plus 5x. Then we subtract the derivative of the denominator, which is 2x plus 5, times
22245520	22252720	the numerator, which is e to the 3x minus 7, and that's all over the denominator squared
22252720	22262720	x squared plus 5x squared. Not a lot to clean up in there, so after using our quotient rule
22262800	22273800	and the exponent rule, we'll call that our derivative. Let's do one more, one that doesn't
22273800	22285800	use a base of e to the x, but uses some different base. Let's try f of x equals 4 to the x
22285800	22293920	times 5 to the x minus x. We could distribute the 4 to the x through, and then we don't
22293920	22299920	have to use the product rule. Well, we still would, but let's just keep it the way it is.
22299920	22306720	f prime of x is equal to, and we'll use the product rule here. The derivative of the first
22306720	22313000	part, the derivative of 4 to the x is 4 to the x, but if the base is not e, we need to
22313020	22324020	multiply by the natural log of the base, then times the second part, 5 to the x minus 1,
22324020	22333520	plus the derivative of the second part, well the derivative of an exponential is the exponential
22333520	22343080	times the natural log of the base minus the derivative of x is 1, times the first part,
22343080	22350200	which is just 4 to the x, and there's not really much that cleans up in this example
22350200	22358200	either, and so we end up with our solution. Basically, all we're doing is we're expanding
22359120	22366120	our repertoire of derivatives to include these two exponential formulas. The derivative of
22366120	22373120	anything is, I'm sorry, the derivative of the exponential is the exponential times the
22373120	22378120	natural log of the base. If it's e to the x, it's really nice because the derivative of
22378120	22390400	e to the x is just e to the x. We can use the fact that the exponential derivative is
22390400	22403400	so simple to derive and create the derivative of the logarithmic, if I can spell it right.
22403400	22418000	Logarithmic functions, and the way we get the derivative of the logarithmic functions is
22418000	22437480	we use implicit differentiation, because we know that if y equals the natural log of x,
22437480	22448960	we can rewrite this as e to the y equals x, because the base is e, the exponent is y,
22448960	22454360	and then if we take the derivative of both sides of this guy using implicit differentiation,
22454360	22466240	the derivative of e to the y is e to the y dy dx equals, the derivative of x is 1, dividing
22466240	22478960	both sides by e to the y, we get the derivative dy dx is equal to 1 over e to the y. But the
22478960	22488360	good news is, is that we know what y equals. y is equal to the natural log of x. So we
22488360	22494000	have 1 over e to the natural log of x, but e and the natural log with the same base is
22494000	22500600	our inverses, so that leaves us with just the x, and so we find out that dy dx is equal
22500600	22520880	to 1 over x. Kinda need how the formula comes out, so we've got our formulas for the logarithms.
22520880	22530420	The derivative of the natural log of x, we just found out is simply 1 over x. If the
22530420	22536040	base isn't a base either, we can do the derivative of any log base b of x, doing just a simple
22536040	22546360	change of base formula, we end up with 1 over x natural log of b, and these two formulas
22546360	22554500	allow us to take the derivatives with logarithms. Two more formulas to add to our derivative
22554500	22564680	repertoire. And so we should be able to solve a whole bunch of examples using all the other
22564680	22576520	derivative rules we've seen, but now throwing in some logarithms. If f of x equals the natural
22576520	22587520	log of the tangent of x squared minus 5x, what we really have is derivatives inside of
22587520	22600200	derivatives, so that f prime of x equals, using the chain rule, natural log, the derivative
22600200	22609880	of that is 1 over the stuff, 1 over the tangent of x squared minus 5x, times the derivative
22609880	22618920	of the inside. Well, the derivative of tangent is secant squared of the stuff, x squared
22618920	22628600	minus 5x, times the derivative of the inside, which is the x squared minus 5x, the derivative
22628600	22639600	there is 2x minus 5, and all there is to do is clean that up nicely, all that stuff multiplied
22639600	22645320	ends up in the numerator, and so we get this nice derivative secant squared of x squared
22645320	22670360	minus 5x, times the 2x minus 5, all over the tangent of x squared minus 5x. Let's try
22670360	22680280	one with the log that's got a different base. Let's say f of x is equal to the log base
22680280	22699920	7 of 2x minus 5, times the cosine of 5x. Here we have the product rule again, so we'll
22699920	22713120	take the derivative of the first, the derivative of log base 7 is 1 over the stuff, the 2x
22713120	22719280	minus 5, and because it's not a base e, we have to multiply by the natural log of the
22719280	22729560	base or the natural log of 7, times the second part. Actually, before we get to the second
22729560	22737240	part, we still need to multiply by the derivative of the inside, which is just 2, times the
22737240	22747820	second part, which is cosine of 5x, plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative
22747820	22757000	of cosine is negative sine, so let's change that to negative sine of 5x, times the derivative
22757000	22765140	of the inside, which is 5, and we still have to, using the product rule, multiply by the
22765140	22776540	first part, which is log base 7 of 2x minus 5. I just want to clean it up a little bit,
22776540	22781700	not much to clean up, but we'll definitely make it easier on the eyes. We'll combine
22781700	22793900	the fraction together, so we have 2 cosine of 5x over 2x minus 5, natural log of 7, minus,
22793900	22813980	we'll put the 5 out front, sine of 5x, log base 7 of 2x minus 5, and we have our derivative.
22813980	22819600	One nice thing that comes out of working with logarithms and derivatives is that logs have
22819600	22828180	some nice properties that help us simplify out to something that is very simple to take
22828180	22837300	the derivative of. For example, if we were given f of x equals the natural log of x to
22837300	22848860	the fourth, cosine of x, divided by the square root of x plus 3, that looks very ugly to
22848880	22857280	take the derivative of. However, we can break this up into three separate logarithms, one
22857280	22864680	for each factor. The logarithm from the denominator is going to be negative, and then we can also
22864680	22870440	pull exponents out in front of logarithms. So what we really have here, rewriting the
22870440	22880340	function is the natural log of x to the fourth, but the four moves out front, plus the natural
22880340	22890660	log of the cosine of x minus the natural log of the x plus 3, and then the one half power
22890680	22900720	can move out front. Now we've got something that's much easier to work with, much easier
22900720	22907400	to take the derivative of. f prime of x is equal to, we've got a constant of 4 times
22907400	22916000	the derivative of the natural log of x, which is just 1 over x, plus the natural log means
22916000	22922620	the derivative is 1 over that, so 1 over cosine of x, times the derivative of the inside,
22922620	22933220	which is negative sine of x, we'll just stick that in the numerator, minus one half, that's
22933220	22939580	a constant, so that's going to be out front, and the derivative of the natural log is 1
22939580	22949160	over the stuff, x plus 3, times the derivative of the inside, which is just 1, and we can
22949160	22956840	clean this up a little bit even, so that it's equal to 4 over x, we'll just say minus instead
22956840	22963800	of plus or negative, and sine over cosine we should recognize, sine over cosine is the
22963800	22973140	tangent, minus 1 over, and we could distribute if we want, 2x plus 6, don't have to distribute,
22973140	22983260	but why not, and we get this nice derivative. So that's one nice thing that comes out of
22983260	22990260	derivatives with logarithms, is quite often logarithms help us break the problem down,
22990260	22998480	where it started complex, what we end up with is quite simple to take the logarithm of.
22998480	23016760	Another nice trick that comes out of this, is what we call logarithmic differentiation,
23016760	23031700	which we use when the variable, we'll say x, but the variable is in both the exponent
23031700	23047320	and base, and the most classic example of that is if y equals x to the x power. Here
23047320	23051840	we can't really take the derivative because we could use the exponent rule, but that doesn't
23051840	23059160	work because we don't know what x is, we don't know how to do the base, we're kind of stuck
23059160	23065020	until we get this nice trick called logarithmic differentiation, where we take the natural
23065020	23074280	log of both sides, and when we do we get the natural log of y equals the natural log of
23074280	23087940	x to the x power, which allows us to use the log property. The log property says the natural
23088180	23094960	log of x to the n is equal to n times the natural log of x, we can move that exponent
23094960	23107280	out front, so now we have the natural log of y equals x times the natural log of x. Now
23107280	23112000	we can take the derivative, but because this has the natural log of y on both sides we
23112060	23132060	have to do implicit differentiation. The derivative of the natural log of y is 1 over y dy dx.
23132060	23136180	The derivative of x natural log of x, that's a product rule, we'll always end up with a
23136200	23147080	product rule here, the derivative of x is 1 times the natural log of x, plus the derivative
23147080	23155560	of natural log of x is 1 over x times the first, which is just x, but x over x is just
23155560	23167940	equal to 1, which is really nice. Then what we need to do is solve for the dy dx, we know
23167940	23176700	implicit differentiation, and it always turns out to do that we multiply by y. With implicit
23176700	23181540	differentiation this step is always the same, because you'll always have 1 over y, I'm sorry
23181540	23186520	not with implicit differentiation, with logarithmic differentiation this step is always the same,
23186520	23192520	because you'll always have 1 over y on the right, so we'll multiply both sides by y,
23192520	23203020	giving us dy dx is equal to the natural log of x plus 1 times y. So all that's left to
23203020	23216960	do then is to substitute y from the original function, y is equal to x to the x, so dy
23216960	23223720	dx is equal to, and I'll just put the y in front, x to the x times the natural log of
23223720	23237980	x plus 1, and now we've got our derivative. We can use this process though to solve things
23237980	23243260	that are much more complex than x to the x, we'll use this process of taking the log of
23243260	23248860	both sides and then the derivative implicitly to solve things more complex that might look
23248860	23266000	something like this, y equals 3x squared minus 5x all to the sine of x power. We have x both
23266000	23273400	in the base and in the exponent, when it occurs in both places we take the natural log of
23273400	23284060	both sides, the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x to the sine of x, whoops lost my
23284060	23292460	end, not to the sixth to the sine of x, let's clean that up. Now we have our log property
23292460	23297960	that says that exponent can come out front, so we know the natural log of y is equal to
23297960	23310320	the sine of x times the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x, then we can take the derivative
23310320	23319560	implicitly. On the left the derivative of the natural log of y is 1 over y times our
23319560	23329800	dy dx is equal to, we have a product rule here, the derivative of sine is cosine x times
23329800	23338360	the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative
23338360	23347240	of natural log is 1 over the stuff, 3x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside,
23347240	23363000	and I'll go in the numerator, 6x minus 5 times the first part, the sine of x. Now we can
23363000	23374920	solve for the dy dx by multiplying both sides by y, and that tells us that dy dx is equal
23374920	23387200	to the cosine x natural log of 3x squared minus 5x plus 6x minus 5 times the sine of
23387200	23402600	x all over 3x squared minus 5x times y, but we know what y equals, y is equal to the original
23403320	23415120	problem. So dy dx is equal to the cosine of x times the natural log of 3x squared minus
23415120	23427960	5x plus 6x minus 5 sine of x divided by 3x squared minus 5x times our original problem
23427960	23442440	which was 3x squared minus 5x all to the sine of x power. And logarithms take that which
23442440	23450440	once was impossible, now very possible and straight forward. So we've kind of done three
23450440	23455040	things today, we talked about the derivatives of the exponentials, specifically e to the
23455040	23461800	x is e to the x, we talked about the derivatives of the logarithms, the derivative of the natural
23461800	23470600	log is 1 over x or 1 over the stuff, and then we talked about doing logarithmic differentiation
23470600	23476720	to take problems that would otherwise be impossible to take derivatives of, change their form
23476720	23484080	so that we can use logarithmic differentiation to find our derivative. Couple things to practice
23484120	23492960	with, take a look at those and we will see you in class to work on them further.
23492960	23499000	This video is going to take a look at a preview of working in two dimensions and three dimensions
23499000	23503760	and taking derivatives. Thus far we've only taken derivatives in the x direction where
23503760	23509040	we've got a coordinate plane in two dimensions, but we can extend that to a three dimensional
23509040	23515240	coordinate plane and still work with derivatives. The trick is we have to decide what direction
23515240	23535040	we're going in. So the question is going to be how do we calculate derivatives in 3D?
23535040	23541200	Now a 3D function, generally a 2D function is f of x, we've done a lot of work with that
23541200	23548120	because we just take the derivative with response to f of x with respect to x, but a three dimensional
23548120	23554360	function will have variables x and y in them to result in a z variable that's a solution.
23554360	23559320	So these are still a function, we've just got multiple variables inside the function,
23559320	23571440	and the way we take those derivatives is we take what is called a partial derivative,
23571440	23592520	or a derivative or rate of change in a specific direction. In other words, are we going left
23592520	23597840	and right? Are we going forwards and backwards? How far are we changing in each of these two
23598240	23604720	directions? And so to specify that we're just taking a derivative partially in one direction,
23604720	23616880	we've got a special notation to indicate this. You will see what we call the partial derivative
23616880	23631880	of f with respect to x. I'll even write that, that's the partial derivative in the x direction,
23631880	23643160	and you might think about that as the left right direction loosely. And it's kind of
23643160	23649960	this funky df dx that we saw before, but now because it's got this curved looking d, that
23649960	23655960	notation should tell us we're talking about a partial derivative in the x direction. And
23655960	23667520	similarly, you'll see a partial derivative with respect to y, that's the partial derivative
23667520	23673720	in the y direction, or how fast we're changing in the y direction, which you might think
23673720	23681800	of loosely as the up-down direction. And by up-down, I mean if I'm looking down at a
23681800	23688520	piece of paper, away from me and towards me, up-down, or left-right would be the other
23688520	23693640	two directions. So how are we changing left and right? How are we changing horizontally?
23693640	23702760	As we've got a partial change of the function. And the way we actually calculate a partial
23702760	23729560	derivative is we treat all other variables as constants.
23729560	23745560	So for example, let's say we've got f of x, y is equal to 3x squared y to the fourth.
23745560	23753880	And if I wanted to calculate the partial of f with respect to x in the x direction, we're
23753880	23759040	going to take the derivative with respect to x, and we're going to pretend the y is
23759040	23767960	a constant. So the derivative of 3x squared is 6x, and the y to the fourth is a constant.
23767960	23776080	So it's going to kind of hang out like constants do when they're multiplied by our x. I could
23776080	23783000	also take the derivative of this same function with respect to the y. In that case, we take
23783000	23788960	the derivative of the y, which is y cubed, and then we bring the 4 out front, 4 times
23788960	23799560	3 is 12, and we keep the x squared as if it was a constant, as if it was part of the 3.
23799560	23820280	Really important here to note, though, that the notation and process is different than
23820280	23836520	implicit differentiation. Implicit differentiation used that whole dy dx. With dy dx, y was
23836520	23843360	a function of x in two dimensions. y was f of x. Now we've got a three-dimensional function
23843360	23849360	that has x's and y's in the function, but these are functions. These pass the vertical
23849600	23857100	line test, or in three dimensions, the vertical plane test. With implicit differentiation,
23857100	23861400	we took the derivative of y as if it was a function of x, and then multiplied by its
23861400	23866160	derivative dy dx. That is different than partial derivatives, where we're just going
23866160	23874360	in the x direction in three dimensions, and the y is treated like a constant. Or we're
23874360	23879960	going in the y direction, and the x is treated as a constant. Be careful not to mix these
23879960	23889260	two processes, because they are very different. Let's try a few examples, though, where we
23889260	23893920	have to take a bunch of partials. What's nice about these partial derivatives is it's a great
23893920	23900760	place for us to synthesize all the derivative rules that we have seen up to this point and
23900760	23913280	see how we do. Let's first take a function in x and y. Let's call it 5x squared minus
23913280	23928920	7xy minus 9y to the fifth plus 2x minus 7y plus 3. First, we'll find the partial of f
23928920	23937440	with respect to x. We're going to pretend like all the y's are constants as we take
23937440	23946140	the derivative with respect to x. Our first term, we know that's 10x, minus the derivative
23946140	23956560	of x is 1, so we're just left with the constants 7 and y. The 9y to the fifth, those are all
23956600	23964100	constants, and the derivative of just a constant is 0, so that term's gone. 2x, the derivative
23964100	23973000	of that, is just 2. Again, the 7y, all constant, the 3, constant. Therefore, those derivatives
23973000	23983560	are also 0. Our partial derivative of f with respect to x is 10x minus 7y plus 2. We can
23983560	23990240	also take the partial derivative of f with respect to the y. With respect to the y, the
23990240	23998320	5x squared is now a constant, so that's 0. Negative 7xy, the derivative of the y is
23998320	24004280	1, so we're just left with the constant 7x. The derivative of negative 9y to the fifth
24004280	24012640	is negative 45y to the fourth, bringing that 5 out front and dropping the exponent by 1.
24012640	24021440	2x, it's all constant. The derivative of negative 7y is negative 7, and 3 is also a constant,
24021440	24028300	so that derivative is 0. Now we've got our partial derivatives with respect to x and
24028300	24036700	the partial derivative with respect to y. Let's try another one. We'll increase in complexity
24036700	24043780	here, making these more interesting. Function of f with respect to x and y, the function
24043780	24057280	of f with x and y as variables is the secant of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y, and
24057280	24066760	now the partial of f with respect to x. Here we've got a chain rule set up. We've got a
24066760	24073440	secant of stuff. The derivative of secant is secant tangent of the stuff, so the secant
24073440	24084160	of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y tangent of the stuff, which is x to the fourth y plus
24084160	24094880	7x minus 4y times the derivative of the stuff inside it with respect to x. The x to the
24094880	24103480	fourth becomes 4x cubed with the constant of y still there, plus the derivative of 7x
24103480	24111920	is just 7. Negative 4y, those are all constants because we treat the y as a constant, so it's
24111920	24123400	zero, and now we've got our partial derivative of f with respect to x. Let's try the partial
24123400	24133720	derivative of f with respect to y. Very similar chain rule again. The derivative of secant
24133720	24142680	is still the secant tangent of the stuff, so we have the secant of x to the fourth y
24142680	24155680	plus 7x minus 4y tangent of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y times the derivative of
24155680	24166520	the inside stuff with respect to y. So now with the x to the fourth y, the derivative
24166520	24174240	of y is just 1, so we're left with the constant x to the fourth. 7x doesn't have any y's
24174240	24184720	on it, so that goes to zero, and the derivative of negative 4y is negative 4. Now we've got
24184720	24198640	the derivative, the partial derivative with respect to y. Let's make this a little more
24198640	24209880	interesting. Let's say f is a function of x and y, which is equal to e to the x, y cosine
24209880	24228560	of 2x, sine of 3y, and if we want the partial of f with respect to x. Here we've got a
24228560	24234880	product with respect to x. The sine of 3y is a constant, so really the only product
24234880	24244320	is e to the x, y times the cosine of 2x, and then we will have that constant out in front.
24244320	24251480	So I'm just going to go ahead and write that constant in front. The sine of 3y times the
24251480	24258960	derivative of e to the x, y is e to the x, y times the derivative of the inside with
24258960	24269600	respect to x is just y times the second part, which is the cosine of 2x, plus the derivative
24269600	24275400	of the second part. The derivative of cosine is negative sine. Let's make that negative
24275400	24283960	sine of 2x times the derivative of the inside, which is 2, and let's go ahead and put that
24283960	24295520	2 in front of the sine just to keep it clean. Times the other part, e to the x, y, and we've
24295520	24304720	got our partial derivative with respect to x. Let's also do the partial derivative of
24304720	24314320	f with respect to y. Very similarly, but this time, notice the factor of cosine of 2x does
24314320	24321360	not have any y's on it. That is a constant that's being multiplied by stuff with y's.
24321360	24329360	So that constant we'll put out front, cosine of 2x, times the derivative of the product.
24329560	24337840	Our product is multiplying e to the x, y times the sine of 3y. We'll take the derivative
24337840	24345040	of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second times the first, all the partial
24345040	24354220	with respect to y. The derivative of e to the x, y is e to the x, y times the derivative
24354220	24361900	of the inside, the derivative of x, y with respect to y is just x, times the second part,
24361900	24369860	which is the sine of 3y, plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative of sine
24369860	24380700	is the cosine of 3y, times the derivative of the inside, which is a 3, times the first
24380700	24397140	part, e to the x, y. And we have our derivative. Let's try one last example.
24397140	24410140	F is a function of x and y. It's equal to the tangent of x to the fourth, y to the third,
24410140	24421580	times the natural log of 5 over x, y. Now something to make life easier, you should
24421580	24426580	be very good at picking up now. When we see a fraction like 5 over x, y, we can think
24426580	24438820	about that as 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1, because that's going to be easier
24438820	24444100	to take the derivative of. So as we take the derivative, that's the natural log of 5x to
24444100	24450620	the negative 1, y to the negative 1. And first we're going to do the partial derivative of
24450620	24459860	f with respect to x. And again, we have a product rule. And each product part is going
24459860	24465780	to be a chain rule, so there's going to be a couple pieces to this one. First, the derivative
24465780	24476140	of the first times the second. The derivative of tangent is secant squared of the stuff.
24476140	24483740	And then we multiply by the derivative of the inside with respect to x. So the derivative
24483740	24491740	of x to the fourth is 4x cubed. And the y cubed is a constant. Times the natural log
24491740	24502940	of 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1. Plus, the derivative of the second. The
24502940	24511660	derivative of natural log is 1 over the stuff, 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1.
24511660	24520420	Times the derivative of the inside with respect to x, which is going to be negative 5x to
24520420	24526780	the negative 2, bringing the negative 1 out front, subtracting 1. And the y to the negative
24526780	24540580	1 is a constant. Times the tangent of x to the fourth, y cubed. Times the first part.
24540580	24547500	Little bit to clean up, let's move the 4x cubed, y cubed to the front. Also the 5 over
24547740	24555860	5 reduces out. The y to the negative 1s reduce out, which is really nice. And so we're just
24555860	24566300	left with an x to the, when I move the negative 2 down, it's going to be just a positive 1
24566300	24576620	left over. So cleaning that up, we get 4x cubed, y cubed secant squared of x to the
24576620	24588220	fourth, y cubed natural log of, let's go ahead and make this a fraction, 5 over x, y. Plus,
24588220	24595020	we've got the tangent of x cubed, or I'm sorry, x to the fourth, y cubed. And all that's
24595020	24601900	left from that ugly fraction we crossed everything out is just an x in the denominator. And now
24601900	24614940	we've got our partial derivative with respect to x. Let's do the partial derivative with
24614940	24621180	respect to y. It's going to be very similar because x and y appear in very similar locations.
24621180	24628700	But just to walk through it together, product rule again. So first, the derivative of tangent
24628780	24638540	is secant squared of the stuff, x to the fourth, y cubed times the derivative of the inside,
24638540	24646860	this time with respect to y. In the y direction is 3y squared. And the x to the fourth is a constant
24649900	24655180	times the second part, which is the natural log of, I'll just leave it as 5 over x, y.
24655180	24666780	Plus, the derivative of the second part, which is natural log is 1 over the stuff,
24666780	24676060	1 over 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1 times the derivative of the inside, which is
24676060	24683500	going to be y to the negative 2 with a negative 5 and an x to the negative 1 because an x is a constant.
24685340	24690380	Times the first part, which is tangent of x to the fourth, y cubed.
24693660	24698300	The cleanup is very similar. We'll move the 3x to the fourth y squared to the front.
24700060	24705500	The fives are going to divide out, which is nice. Oops, I just saw an error that I missed earlier.
24705500	24711020	We had a minus and my minus disappeared. That should have been a minus on number four.
24711100	24714300	I apologize for that. Don't lose your signs.
24716300	24722940	But the x to the negative ones do divide out. And when we bring the y down, we'll just be left
24722940	24732860	with a single y in the denominator. So for our cleaned up version, we have 3x to the fourth y
24732860	24744060	squared secant squared of x to the fourth y cubed natural log of 5 over xy minus because of the
24744060	24751020	minus sign. Not forgetting it this time. We'll put the tangent of x cubed x to the fourth y cubed
24751980	24759340	in the numerator. And in the denominator, all that's left is a single y. And we have our partial
24759340	24769180	derivative with respect to y. The homework assignment with partial derivatives is really short,
24769980	24774620	but they are going to force you to review all of these derivatives properties we've worked with
24774620	24779980	here in chapter three, which is what makes it such a great assignment. So take a look at it,
24779980	24785420	give it a good practice, and then we will see you in class to discuss these partial derivatives
24785420	24795500	in a little more detail. Chapter four is going to take a look at how we can use the derivative
24795500	24802220	in various contexts and applications. The first one is what are called related rates. And so our
24802220	24807900	question we're going to answer is how are rates of change?
24815180	24821820	That's a derivative, a rate of change. How are they related to each other?
24822140	24840540	And this is what brings up this idea of related rates. And basically a related rate means two
24840540	24845660	things are changing, but they're changing in relationship to one another. One increases at
24845660	24851260	a certain rate and it makes the other one increase or decrease at a certain rate. The best example
24851260	24857180	of this is if you think about filling up a balloon. Let's say if we have a spherical balloon
24857660	24864860	that is filled
24867740	24881020	with air at a rate of three cubic inches per second.
24881100	24886860	We want to know how fast
24889820	24891420	is the radius changing
24902220	24903260	when the radius
24906700	24910860	is four inches?
24911020	24917500	As we solve these related rate problems, the radius of the balloon is related to the amount
24917500	24924220	of air in it. As we solve these problems, we're going to go through kind of a four-step process.
24924220	24928300	The first step is going to be to draw a picture
24932140	24940860	with the related formulas.
24941500	24950140	So we're talking here about a sphere. So we'll draw our little spherical balloon here
24952140	24957820	and the radius of r. And we're talking specifically about the volume or how much
24957820	24963260	stuff is in this circle. And we can look up or we might know the formula for the volume of a sphere
24963260	24967500	is four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.
24970620	24976540	Once we know that relationship, we're ready for the second step which is to take the derivative
24983740	24985100	with respect
24988940	24993100	to time.
24993980	25002140	So if I were to take the derivative of this guy, we're going to have to use implicit
25002140	25009420	differentiation because time t is not a variable here. So v, the derivative of v is just one dv dt
25011900	25016300	is equal to when we four-thirds and pi are constants.
25017260	25024380	And we know we can use our exponent rule on the three, bringing the three out front and reducing
25024380	25034060	it by one, so r squared, and then times the derivative of r which is dr dt. This one's kind
25034060	25042540	of nice because the threes are going to divide out. So we really say dv dt is equal to four pi r
25042540	25059420	squared dr dt. And now that we have our derivative with respect to time, let's plug in what we know
25059420	25063740	and I can't quite fit it all on the screen, so hopefully you have it on your notes. We're going
25063820	25080940	to plug in what we know. And what we know is that the volume is increasing at a rate of three cubic
25080940	25088940	inches per second. That is the change in volume with respect to time. We also know that the radius
25089020	25095580	is currently four inches. It's not changing with respect to time, it's at this moment exactly
25095580	25104460	four inches. So when we come down to plug in dv dt, the volume is changing at a rate of three
25104460	25115020	cubic inches equals four pi r, the radius we said was four inches squared dr dt. And then all we
25115020	25129180	have to do is solve for the remaining rate or dr dt, the change in the rate with respect to time.
25130140	25140940	So simplifying, four squared is 16 times four is 64 pi dr dt. And then we can get the dr dt
25141020	25147340	or the change in the radius with respect to time. How fast is that radius changing by dividing three
25147340	25157260	by the 64 pi? And then we have three over 64 pi inches per second is the rate that radius is
25157260	25164380	changing when it's exactly four inches long and the volume is increasing at three cubic inches per
25164380	25177180	second. Let's try another related rate problem. Let's say we have a seven foot ladder
25183660	25185340	that is sliding down the wall.
25195340	25197180	And we know that the top
25201340	25203020	is sliding down
25206460	25218140	at a rate of 1.5 feet per second. We want to know how fast
25218460	25223020	is the bottom moving
25229100	25231020	along the ground.
25238220	25239020	When the bottom
25239740	25247500	is six feet from the wall.
25256220	25259420	Let's draw a picture to get a better idea of this. We've got a building,
25260860	25268540	the ground, and there is this ladder that's leaning against them. The problem is that ladder is
25268620	25275100	sliding down the wall at a rate of 1.5 feet per second.
25278780	25281580	We know the ladder itself is seven feet long.
25284220	25288780	And the moment we're interested in is the fact that we are six feet from the wall.
25289580	25299740	And if we call this other side A, we don't know what A is, but we're going to be able to find
25299740	25304940	that pretty quick. The big thing though that we know, we know that the formula for any right
25304940	25311740	triangle is that A squared plus B squared equals C squared.
25312540	25324220	And we can take the derivative of this with respect to time. We have 2A times the change in A with
25324620	25336860	or DADT plus 2B dB dt equals 2C dC dt.
25341420	25345100	Then let's go ahead and plug in what we know and see what we come up with.
25346860	25352060	We can actually figure out how long A is using the same Pythagorean theorem.
25352700	25359500	Seven squared is equal to six squared plus A squared, or A squared plus six squared equals seven
25359500	25371500	squared. A squared is 36. A squared plus 36 equals 49. So A squared is equal to 13. A is the square
25371500	25382620	root of 13. So at this moment up the wall, we're the square root of 13 high. So plugging that into
25382620	25391020	the formula, we have 2 times A, which is the square root of 13, times the change in A with respect
25391020	25397900	to time. We know that A is going down, so we're going to say it's negative to represent the downward
25397900	25403980	motion, and it's moving down at a rate the change with respect to time is negative 1.5.
25406220	25414860	Plus 2B, B is the bottom of six times the change in B with respect to time, and we don't know how
25414860	25419420	fast this ladder is moving out. That's what we're looking for, the dB dt.
25420300	25431100	Equals 2C. C is seven feet, but how fast is C the ladder's length changing?
25432460	25437740	Well, if we think about a ladder sliding down a wall, that ladder's not changing length at all. It's
25437740	25442700	always going to be seven feet long, whether it's completely against the wall, completely against
25442700	25448060	the ground, or anywhere in between. There's no change in the ladder's length, so we'll use zero
25448060	25456140	for that length. When we clean this up, then, we end up with negative 3 square root of 13,
25457180	25469900	plus 12 dB dt equals zero. And this is going to solve quite nicely for us. Add the 3 root
25469900	25479900	13 to both sides. We get 12 dB dt equals 3 square roots of 13. Divide both sides by 12,
25480540	25488700	and the change in B of the base with respect to time is equal to 3 root 13 over 12,
25489580	25496620	and what's nice is the 3 over 12 reduce. So for our final rate, this ladder is moving square root
25496620	25504300	of 13 over 4 feet per second, when the ladder is six feet from the wall.
25509740	25510940	Let's try another example.
25510940	25518380	Let's say a camera
25523420	25524860	is 2,000 feet
25528380	25529100	from a rocket
25534220	25535500	that fires vertically.
25541500	25546380	And when this rocket
25551900	25554060	is 500 feet in the air,
25560060	25561260	its velocity,
25561580	25572940	I mean speed, but with direction, is 400 feet per second.
25578300	25587580	The cameraman needs to know what is the needed rate of change
25591900	25597100	of the angle of the camera.
25605100	25609020	Let's draw a picture to kind of get an idea of what's going on. We've got a little camera here,
25609020	25612380	that's my camera, which is 2,000 feet away
25614540	25618940	from the launch point for a rocket. That's my little rocket. It's going to go up in the air,
25619660	25623020	and the camera is going to change angle so that it can watch that
25625180	25627500	rocket no matter how high it gets.
25631340	25637340	We need to come up with an equation that relates these variables. Well, since we're
25637340	25642540	dealing with an angle and the side's opposite and adjacent, we should know that the tangent
25642540	25650220	of that angle is equal to the height over the 2,000 feet, the opposite over the adjacent.
25652780	25654700	Then we can take the derivative of that.
25657020	25660300	Actually, let's save ourselves a little bit of work. Before we take the derivative,
25660300	25663340	let's multiply both sides by 2,000 so we don't have to
25664380	25669180	worry about the fraction. It's just a constant, so it's not going to make much difference.
25669180	25677740	Now let's take the derivative of that. The derivative is going to be 2,000 secant squared of theta
25679980	25684780	with respect to time, so we have to say dt d theta using that implicit differentiation,
25686300	25689340	equals the derivative of the height is dH dt.
25689500	25698940	So now we can plug in what we know.
25703500	25706220	First, we need to figure out what secant squared of theta is.
25707420	25715260	Secant of theta, you remember, is 1 over the cosine of theta, or the reciprocal of cosine.
25715500	25723660	If cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, the secant is the hypotenuse over the adjacent, the reciprocal.
25726780	25732060	We already know the adjacent side is 2,000. We just need to find the hypotenuse side.
25732700	25736380	We're interested in the moment where the height is 500 feet.
25737180	25748780	Fortunately, the quadratic formula can tell us that 2,000 squared plus 500 squared is going to be equal to c squared.
25751260	25757980	If I were to do that on my calculator, we would get 425 with 4 zeros after it equals c squared,
25757980	25763420	and so if I take the square root, c is approximately equal to 2061.55.
25764380	25767820	So 2061.55.
25772220	25780300	So plugging in what we have, we've got 2,000 times the secant, which is the hypotenuse, 2061.55,
25781660	25785740	over the adjacent, which is 2,000 squared.
25786060	25794140	Oops, I just realized I got a small error up here. It should be d theta dt. We're taking the respect to time.
25794780	25798060	The change in the angle with respect to time is what we're solving for.
25801020	25807100	The change in the height, we know the height is increasing at 400 feet per second.
25809260	25812460	The change in the height is 400 feet per second.
25813180	25816300	Then we start multiplying this out.
25817740	25823180	We will do the 2,000 times 2061.55 over 2,000 squared.
25823740	25831260	When I do all of that, I get 2125 approximately d theta dt
25832140	25846540	equals the 400, so the change in the angle with respect to time after I divide is 400 over 2125,
25847900	25856620	which if I divide that, I get 0.1882 radians per second.
25856940	25866540	So when this rocket is 500 feet in the air, the camera needs to be changing its angle at 0.1882 radians per second.
25870140	25873660	Let's do one last example of these related rates.
25874220	25879100	Finding an equation that relates the rates, taking a derivative with respect to time,
25880540	25883180	plugging in what we know, and solving.
25883180	25890140	Let's say I have a funnel and water is draining from it.
25890140	25891500	Water is draining
25896940	25901420	from a cone-shaped funnel.
25902380	25916300	At a rate of 0.25 cubic feet per second.
25922780	25923740	The height of the funnel
25931820	25932540	is 3 feet.
25939500	25940940	And the radius at the top
25946620	25947340	is 2 feet.
25952780	25955660	But we're not interested in the funnel, we want to know about the water.
25955660	25956620	At what rate
25962220	25963100	is the height
25968060	25968780	of the water
25973660	25974140	changing
25980140	25980940	when the height
25984620	25985500	is 1 foot?
25991420	25995180	Well, let's draw a picture of our funnel.
25997260	25998140	Here's our funnel.
26000060	26001180	Water is leaking out.
26003580	26006140	It's not full though, so here's the water level.
26008220	26011660	The funnel itself we know is 3 feet high.
26014220	26016540	The radius on the funnel is 2 feet.
26016620	26022860	That's a constant, so we'll label those constants.
26022860	26028140	We know water is coming out at 0.025 feet per second.
26028140	26032300	So we'll call that negative 0.25 feet per second.
26034060	26035580	Cubic feet per second.
26035580	26036220	It's a volume.
26039740	26042140	We're interested specifically in the water.
26042140	26045420	We don't really know the radius and the height because that's going to change.
26046140	26047180	Those aren't constant.
26049900	26053820	But what we do know is an equation about the volume of that water.
26054540	26057820	You might have to look it up or we might know that the volume of a cone
26058620	26062860	is 1 third pi r squared times the height.
26065340	26069660	The problem we have is we end up with three variables.
26069660	26072780	And so if we were to take the derivative, we'd have three rates of change.
26072780	26074620	The change in the height, the change in the radius,
26074620	26076220	and the change in the volume.
26076220	26080300	We want to reduce that down to 2, so it's a little more manageable.
26081180	26087740	Fortunately, if we were to draw a line down the middle,
26087740	26091500	you see we end up with triangles that make up kind of the right side,
26092460	26095740	a big triangle with a height of 3 and a length of 2,
26096620	26103420	and a small triangle with a height of h and a radius of r.
26105020	26110780	Those triangles, because they both have a right angle and sharing angle,
26110780	26114060	are similar triangles, so their sides must be proportional.
26114700	26119260	In other words, if we set up the radius divided by the height on the little triangle,
26119820	26124300	it would be the same on the big triangle, a radius of 2 divided by the height of 3.
26125820	26129980	And we can solve this for r really quickly by multiplying by h.
26129980	26133180	r is equal to 2h over 3.
26135580	26139340	And so let's plug that in to our radius.
26139340	26142060	That's going to reduce out the radius variable,
26142060	26145100	because we really don't care about the radius.
26145100	26153100	We care about the height, and we care about the volume of the water decreasing.
26153100	26155580	We've got height and we've got volume.
26155580	26158780	We do not have anything about the radius, so let's stick with that pattern.
26159180	26169580	So our volume is 1 third pi times the radius, which is 2h over 3 squared times h.
26171500	26174060	And actually, let's go ahead and simplify that.
26174060	26178060	We've got 1 third pi times 2 squared is 4,
26178060	26184220	h squared over 3 squared is 9 times the height.
26184860	26192860	And so our final formula that connects the variables of the height and the volume.
26193740	26195180	Oops, not 1 third.
26195180	26196060	Let's multiply.
26196060	26200700	1 times 4 is 4, 3 times 9 is 27.
26201260	26211500	So we've got 4 pi over 27 times the height cubed.
26214220	26225180	Now that we have our formula connecting our variables, we'll take the derivative.
26225180	26230380	The derivative of v is 1 dv dt, the change in the volume with respect to time.
26232620	26240380	4 pi over 27 is a constant, but the derivative of h cubed is h squared with the 3 out front
26241340	26242540	times dh dt.
26247420	26248540	Let's go ahead and simplify.
26248540	26261180	3 over 27 is 9, so dv dt is equal to 4 pi over 9 h squared dh dt.
26263980	26266780	Let's come over here to the side and plug in what we know.
26267660	26272540	dv dt, that's the change in the volume with respect to time.
26272540	26277100	We said the volume was decreasing at 0.25 cubic feet per second.
26277100	26282860	Decreasing, so it's negative, 0.25 is equal to 4 pi over 9.
26285980	26289740	The height that the moment we care about, the moment we care about
26290540	26298460	is 1 feet, so we're going to put 1 in for our height at the moment we care about,
26299740	26306220	squared, dh dt, that's what we're looking for, the change in the height with respect to time.
26307100	26317740	So we have negative 0.25 is equal to 1 squared is 1 times 4 is 4 pi over 9 dh dt.
26320460	26329660	And so to get dh dt alone, we multiply by 9 over 4 pi times the negative 0.25
26332460	26335100	and the change in height with respect to time
26337180	26348620	is equal to approximately, putting that in the calculator, negative 0.17914 feet per second.
26350380	26357500	In other words, at that moment the height is decreasing by almost 0.18 feet per second.
26361100	26365100	And that's how we're going to handle these related rates. We're going to take a look at drawing a
26365100	26370060	picture, finding a formula that relates the variables of interest, the variables that are
26370060	26376300	changing specifically, then we'll take the derivative with respect to time implicitly
26377100	26382700	and then we'll plug in what we know and solve for what we don't know. Give a couple of those
26382700	26387100	some practice on the assignment and we will see you in class to discuss this further.
26389740	26396060	Sometimes it is easier to use a derivative to approximate the value of a equation or a function
26396060	26401340	than it is to actually calculate the exact value and that's what we're going to take a look at
26401420	26419820	today. The question is going to be how do we approximate a function at a point?
26420780	26432140	And to set this up we're going to start by asking the why it works or what's going on in the background,
26433020	26441020	the why, behind what we call linear approximation.
26451500	26454860	To set this up we're going to recall the equation of a tangent line.
26463020	26475820	To the function f of x at the point a
26478780	26479260	is
26482540	26487100	y equals the y-coordinate which is just f of a
26487820	26493580	plus the slope of the tangent line at a which is f prime of a
26495740	26498540	times x minus the point which is a.
26501740	26507180	And what we also know is that close to the point, close to a,
26507820	26512380	it is close
26515820	26522700	to f of a. In other words, here's what I mean. Let's say I've got this curve here
26526460	26530860	and there's this point on the curve that we're going to call a
26530940	26536220	and we calculate this tangent line at a
26539420	26543020	and if I look at a value that is close to a
26549020	26554700	it's also going to be close to the point of the line. It's also going to be a very similar height.
26554780	26565180	It's going to be close to f of a. It's off by a little bit but that line can give us a really good
26565180	26570940	estimation of what's happening close to the point a as it curves away from a.
26572620	26575820	And the fact of the matter is lines
26578540	26579420	are easier
26579980	26583180	than curves
26585980	26587180	to calculate points.
26593100	26597500	And so we're going to prefer to use that blue line that gets us close to a
26598780	26602300	to calculate what's actually happening close to a.
26603580	26606380	Maybe this will look better with a more concrete example.
26607100	26608620	Let's take a look at
26610860	26611420	example.
26613740	26619500	Let's say we were trying to calculate the square root of 25.1 by hand.
26620940	26624860	That would be very very difficult because it doesn't have a perfect square root. We know it's
26624860	26631100	close to five because the square root of 25 is five and that's the fact that we're going to use
26631100	26640380	in order to estimate it. We know that the square root of 25.1 is close to the square root of 25.
26643020	26644540	So we can consider.
26648300	26653500	Let's say the function f of x is equal to the square root of x or as we like to have it in
26653500	26655500	calculus x to the one half.
26658220	26664380	Then f prime of x the derivative is one half times x to the negative one half
26665980	26669500	or one over two square root of x.
26673260	26681100	We need to know what f of 25 the easy point and f prime of 25 is
26682060	26688140	in order to estimate the not so easy point of the square root of 25.1.
26689420	26693420	Well f of 25 is the square root of 25 which we know is five
26695260	26702300	and f prime of 25 is one over two times the square root of 25 or one over two times five
26703500	26704060	one tenth.
26704780	26711980	So if we want the linear approximation
26717660	26723100	of the square root of x at 25
26726700	26730300	that's just the equation of our tangent line.
26730620	26733820	The y coordinate of five
26736780	26740220	plus the slope which is the derivative one tenth
26741500	26745340	times x minus the x coordinate which is 25.
26748060	26755500	We can use this linear equation to estimate the square root of numbers very close to 25.
26755820	26758220	So we can estimate
26761500	26771820	the square root of 25.1 by using x is equal to 25.1 in this equation.
26772220	26785340	So the linearization at 25.1 is equal to five plus one tenth times 25.1 minus 25
26787340	26793900	and if we plug that into our calculator we will get that the answer is approximately
26793900	26803740	5.01 and so we're estimating that the square root of 25.1 is about 5.01.
26806300	26811100	So I know what you're thinking how good is that estimate? Well let's actually find it on the
26811100	26821260	calculator we did it by hand we're going to compare with the square root of 25.1 on our calculator.
26822060	26836060	So on my calculator I will do the square root of 25.1 and we get 5.00999 that's pretty darn
26836780	26849740	close 5.00999 it is quite close to our estimated value that we found by hand
26849740	26854540	and doing it by hand with the square root would have been a real big pain because curves are
26854540	26861420	difficult to calculate but lines are much easier to work with and so that's this idea of linear
26861420	26866700	approximation is we're going to estimate by finding the equation of the tangent line
26866700	26875820	to see what's happening really close. So let's try some examples see if we can get good at this
26876300	26880780	first example we're going to estimate
26884700	26888140	1 over 3.1 squared
26893900	26901260	well the function that we seem to be working with is we're doing 1 over x squared or x to the negative
26901260	26911820	2 and then we can make the x equal to 3 so f prime the derivative of that is negative 2
26911820	26926700	x to the negative 3 or negative 2 over x cubed 3.1 is close to 3
26926780	26933980	so we're going to find f of 3 and f prime of 3 and then we'll see what's happening
26933980	26940940	close to that so f of 3 is equal to 1 over 3 squared which we know is 1 ninth
26943020	26951900	f prime of 3 is negative 2 over 3 cubed which is negative 2 over 27
26957660	26964940	so let's set up our linear approximation is equal to the y-coordinate of 1 ninth
26967740	26977420	plus the slope which is negative 2 over 27 times x minus the x-coordinate the x-coordinate is 3
26978140	26987740	we can use this to estimate 1 over x squared near the point 3 we're particularly interested
26988620	26999420	in 3.1 so 1 ninth minus 2 over 27 times 3.1 minus 3
27000060	27009820	and if I plug 3.1 into that into my calculator we get 0.1037
27013660	27021260	so let's check it on the calculator what is 1 over 3.1 squared
27022060	27033180	1 divided by 3.1 squared let's see how close we got it's 0.1041
27039420	27046860	and as you can see that is quite close we're only off by about 0.0004
27047820	27054060	not too bad of an estimate doing it by hand was much nicer than doing 3.1 squared getting
27054060	27060220	in something with two decimal points and then doing that long division much nicer
27060220	27064300	this even works with trigonometry let's do a trig example
27064380	27069180	let's estimate
27072540	27076060	the tangent of 44 degrees
27080140	27087180	well let's change that to radians first we see that's close to 45
27087900	27099980	so we're really working with the tangent of 45 degrees and if you remember your unit circle
27100700	27104460	45 degrees is pi over 4
27108060	27114860	so we're looking at the tangent of pi over 4 to estimate our point
27117740	27126940	so f of x is the tangent of a value tangent of any point we're going to find that point
27127580	27131100	f prime we know is the secant squared of x
27136460	27144540	we're specifically interested in pi over 2 so f of pi over 2 is equal to the tangent
27144780	27153420	i'm sorry not pi over 2 pi over 4 the tangent of pi over 4 we should remember is equal to 1
27156060	27162540	and f prime of pi over 4 is the secant squared of pi over 4
27165660	27172780	if it helps to remember secant is 1 over cosine cosine is the x-coordinate 2 root 2 over 2
27173740	27179340	the reciprocal of that is going to be actually i'll write down what i'm talking about here at the top
27181740	27189020	so it's 1 over the cosine of pi over 4 which is 1 over root 2 over 2
27190140	27193980	which is the reciprocal of that 2 over the square root of 2
27194940	27202700	and if i rationalize we get 2 root 2 over 2 which is equal to just the square root of 2
27205100	27211660	so square root of 2 is the secant but that's squared so it's actually equal
27214060	27221020	square root of 2 squared is just 2 remembering your trig from secant how does that work
27221740	27223660	secant of pi over 4 is equal to 2
27227260	27233420	all right let's make our linearization equation then l of x is equal to the y-coordinate of 1
27235420	27238140	plus the slope of 2
27241260	27245100	times x minus the x-coordinate which is pi over 4
27251020	27260700	but we want the linearization of 44 degrees which we have to change that 44 degrees into radians 44 degrees
27263180	27269820	remember we multiply that by pi over 180 so we have 44 pi over 180
27272380	27275420	radians there's no reason to reduce because we're going to use our calculator
27276060	27282060	so we're doing the linearization of 44 pi over 180
27288460	27296860	is equal to 1 plus 2 times 44 pi over 180 minus pi over 4
27297500	27307260	plugging that mess into our calculator we get 0.9651
27312620	27319100	so that's our estimate let's check it with the actual value of the tangent of 44 degrees
27319100	27325020	and since our calculator is probably in radian mode let's do the 44 pi over 180
27327020	27342220	verify that my mode is in radians yes so we've got the tangent of 44 pi divided by 180
27342780	27350060	and it equals 0.9657
27350940	27361020	0.9657 and look how close the actual value was it was only off by 0.0006
27362380	27363820	only a 20th of a percent
27364140	27373180	so we have this idea that we can get close to any curve using a tangent line and so if I move a
27373180	27378220	little bit to the right or if I move a little bit to the left I can see what's happening
27379420	27384780	kind of near that point but it kind of begs this question how much are we off by how much are we
27384780	27393100	changing by this kind of leads into this concept of what we call differentials
27395820	27402140	how much are we off by as x changes how much does y change in relationship to x is there
27402140	27409100	a relationship there a differential is really just the amount a function changes
27415020	27415980	as a result
27419820	27424060	of a small change I'm going to move this up
27428700	27431660	as a result of a small change in x
27433900	27440780	not the amount the amount the amount of function changes as a result of a small change in x
27441100	27450300	so we know that dy dx is equal to the derivative of the function
27455260	27466860	dy though is representing a change in y a small change in y and dx is representing a small
27467660	27474300	change in x it's the change in y with respect x what's happening how are things changing
27474300	27481500	really close to that point so if we want to know how much the y's are changing if we multiply both
27481500	27498700	sides by dx then we get that dy is equal to f prime of x dx and this formula
27500380	27510700	is the formula for a differential it tells us for every small change in y it's equal to the
27510700	27519340	derivative of the function times the small change in x so if I was asked to find the differential
27519340	27535180	equation of y equals four x squared minus secant x first we can take the derivative
27535900	27543260	which is dy dx equals 8x minus secant x tangent x
27546860	27552220	and then multiply both sides by the dx so that we can see what a small change in y does
27553100	27560220	it's equal to whatever 8x minus secant x tangent x dx equals
27561180	27567260	so now if I know the amount of that small change in x I could plug that into this equation
27568140	27577180	and estimate how y is changing for a given small change in x in fact let's do an example equation
27578140	27584380	where we do just that let's find the differential
27589820	27592780	and evaluate
27597740	27605020	when x is equal to zero and the small change in x dx is equal to point two
27607420	27615980	and let's do the function y equals 5x minus three over 2x plus one
27619020	27625260	what we're asking for is at the point zero on this function if the x changes a little bit if the x
27625260	27630860	changes by point two how much would we expect the y to change by what's the little bit y changes by
27632140	27636060	well for this one it's going to be quite a dramatic change because of its structure
27636620	27643180	first we have to find the derivative dy dx and we know the derivative of a fraction is the
27643180	27650220	derivative of the top times the bottom minus the derivative of the bottom times the top
27651740	27658780	and so that gives us five times 2x plus one minus two times 5x minus three all over the
27658780	27668300	bottom squared the 2x plus one squared let's clean that up a little bit five times two let's
27668300	27679340	distribute is 10x plus five minus distributing the negative two through 10x plus six over 2x plus
27679340	27686860	one squared and that's nice because the 10x is subtract out to zero so we're left with
27689420	27693020	11 over 2x plus one squared
27696140	27699340	to get the differential we just multiply both sides by the dx
27701100	27708140	and we find that the differential in y the change in y the difference in y is equal to 11
27709340	27714300	over 2x plus one squared dx
27717340	27725820	now we're asked to evaluate it evaluate what the change in y is when x is zero and the change in x
27725820	27733340	is point two well we'll estimate that as 11 over two times x which is zero plus one squared
27734140	27741500	times the differential times the point two which comes out to be 11 times point two
27742780	27746700	over one which is 2.2
27749500	27755340	so at the point zero when x changes point two we're going to expect the y to change by about
27755340	27760140	2.2 and that's how we can find that differential and see kind of that
27760860	27766700	estimated change at the point so the big thing for today though is linearization to
27766700	27771660	estimate a point and we also took a little bit of a look at differentials take a look at those
27771660	27779900	practice a few and we will see you in class one of the most important things the derivative
27779900	27786940	can tell us is where the minimum and maximum points are on a function so that's what the question
27786940	27805180	we're going to look at today is how do we identify the minimum or the maximum points of a function
27808780	27815020	and to set this up there's a little bit of vocabulary that we need to be familiar with
27815020	27822140	as we work with this concept and to help us kind of visualize the vocabulary I'm going to put a
27822140	27828780	function here let's say it's going to start at zero it's going to come down come up really high
27829500	27838460	go down really low come up a little bit and then go towards an asymptote at zero okay
27838460	27847580	okay the first vocabulary word we need to know is what is the absolute minimum
27851420	27856940	and quite simply the absolute minimum is the lowest point
27860860	27864780	so let's actually give this graph that we just made some coordinates here
27865500	27873340	let's call this we'll just make it one two up and one two down so you can see that the absolute
27873340	27889340	minimum the absolute lowest point is at x is at y equals negative two it's down low y equals negative
27889340	27901980	two the other word we need to know is as you might expect the absolute maximum
27904700	27909260	as you might expect is the highest point on the graph
27911740	27917260	and so the highest point on this graph is up at this top peak we're going to call that the
27917260	27924620	absolute maximum and you see that's at a height of two y equals two is the absolute maximum of this
27924620	27936140	graph we can kind of generalize this idea of absoluteness with what we call the absolute
27936540	27938540	extrema
27943580	27946860	and that is basically just talking about both the absolute
27951500	27956780	max and min together so when I say what are the absolute extrema I'm asking what's the absolute
27956780	27964140	maximum and what's the absolute minimum but we don't just have absolute maximums and minimums we
27964140	27980300	also have what we call local minimums which we'll say is the lowest point in the area
27982700	27986780	so there's nobody lower around here so we're going to call it the absolute
27986780	27991740	minimum and you'll see we've got a little dip off to the right we can call the
27992380	27994380	oops
27996620	28004460	we can call that the local minimum because it's kind of a valley it's not the lowest
28004460	28009980	valley but it is the lowest valley in the area so that's going to be at y equals negative one
28013020	28016460	and similarly we can have a local maximum
28017180	28025900	which as you would expect is the highest point in the area
28030540	28036620	and the local maximum you'll see off to the right with this little peak is the local max
28037420	28041260	it's the highest mountain in the area it's just not the highest mountain
28041260	28045820	overall and that one has a height of one so we would say that is y equals one
28048460	28052780	and similarly we can lump those together and call them the local extrema
28057100	28063100	which is all the local min maxes grouped together
28063180	28072060	what's interesting about all of these points though is if we notice the derivative or the
28072060	28082940	tangent line at each of these points is always going to be a flat line the derivative at each
28082940	28092940	of these points is equal to zero they have a slope of zero slope of zero slope of zero and
28092940	28100700	slope of zero anytime the slope is zero that's going to identify one of these local min or
28100700	28107020	local max and possibly an absolute min or max we have a special name for those points those are
28107020	28121420	called critical points critical points are a point where the derivative
28124540	28128540	is either zero or undefined
28128780	28139340	and what's really important there is it might be a local extremum
28142380	28147740	it's not guaranteed to be a local min or a local max or even an absolute min or an absolute max
28147740	28156380	but it certainly is a very good candidate for that to occur so using this idea
28158540	28166220	this leads into getting away from the vocabulary now this leads into what we call the extreme
28169020	28171500	value theorem
28174380	28182940	or affectionately called the evt extreme value theorem and basically the extreme value theorem
28182940	28187900	states that if a function f is continuous
28192060	28194860	on an interval between a and b
28198700	28202780	then there is
28205980	28207420	an absolute
28213420	28214060	maximum
28222220	28222940	on a b
28226300	28231740	and in absolute minimum
28238780	28239500	on a b
28243180	28247340	in other words if we take a closed interval somewhere on that interval is going to be a
28247340	28252140	maximum and somewhere on that interval is going to be a minimum and what's really important to
28252140	28262140	note is the min and max points are either
28266140	28271020	a the first point of the interval b the end of the interval
28273020	28278620	or what we're going to call c
28280700	28284620	they're either at a b or c where c
28287980	28298380	is when the derivative at that point equals zero or where c is a critical point
28303180	28309420	what this is really saying is find the critical points
28315580	28319420	and test these points
28322460	28323900	and the edges
28324380	28335820	and either the critical points or the edges are going to be your minimums and or your maximums
28338940	28346540	let's take a look at what we mean by that let's say that f of x is equal to two x cubed
28347260	28355740	minus three x squared minus 12x plus five and we're going to look on the interval from zero
28355740	28361340	to four to find the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum in that range
28364620	28369660	well first we have to find the critical points and that's when the derivative is equal to zero
28371580	28376220	because it might level off and come back down so where is that derivative equal to zero
28376220	28384940	well the derivative is 6x squared minus 6x minus 12 and we'll set that equal to zero
28386940	28395020	solving we factor out a six x squared minus x minus two continuing to factor we have x minus
28395020	28402700	two times x plus one and so we've got two potential critical points two and negative one
28402700	28406620	these are the critical points
28413500	28416700	that's where the derivative is zero that's where it levels off
28416700	28421260	however we need to be careful all we really care about is numbers between zero and four
28421260	28425020	so negative one doesn't really help us because it's outside of the range
28427020	28430780	so now we know our critical points we just have to test what is f
28431340	28436940	of the critical point what is f of the edge and f of the other edge
28438460	28443900	one of those is the minimum and one of those is the maximum and one we don't really care about
28444540	28445820	so let's get our calculator
28452460	28458540	let's get y equals clear out any function that might be in there and let's just type our function
28458540	28461500	in here 2x cubed
28465740	28476380	minus 3x squared minus 12x plus five
28478220	28482940	and we'll hit second table so that we can enter in our own values and let's delete out the values
28482940	28491340	we don't care about so we're interested in when x is two when x is zero and when x is four
28493580	28497980	and you see our y's are negative 15 five and 37
28500860	28504460	negative 15 five and 37
28504860	28513660	and we can see on there that negative 15 is the minimum number the 37 is the maximum number
28513660	28522300	we don't care about the zero but we have a maximum of 37 at x equals four
28523820	28530540	and we have a minimum of negative 15 at x equals two
28531500	28539100	we've identified our minimum and maximum using the extreme value theorem or EVT
28539980	28542620	for this function on this range
28546860	28548940	let's try one more that might be a little more open
28549260	28555340	let's see what happens when we say f of x
28557900	28567020	equals cosine squared of x and we're going to do it on negative infinity to infinity
28571980	28576140	it's not really a closed interval but the extreme value theorem should still apply here
28576140	28579420	we can't check the extremes of negative infinity and positive infinity
28579420	28583500	but we certainly can check the critical points to see if there's any minimums
28583500	28591260	or maximums so first f prime of x the derivative it's a chain rule so we have two times the cosine
28591260	28594700	of x times the derivative of cosine which is sine
28595180	28605100	and we want to know when that derivative is equal to zero
28606300	28609740	well it's already factored we just have the cosine of x equals zero
28610700	28612460	and the sine of x equals zero
28614700	28620060	first thinking about the cosine of x on our unit circle cosine of x is equal to zero
28620140	28625180	cosine is the x coordinate it's equal to zero at the top and at the bottom
28625900	28634780	which means x here is equal to pi over two and then we move a pi over to three pi over two
28635420	28638380	so it's pi over two plus
28640940	28649580	n pi's every pi around and n can be any num any element of the integers we'll say
28649580	28655660	n is some integer one two three four or it could be negative one negative two negative three negative four
28660700	28661740	for sine of x
28664940	28670780	sine of x is going to be the x coordinates i'm sorry the y coordinates and the y coordinates
28670780	28681420	are zero here at zero and pi so sine of x tells us that x is equal to pi plus n pi
28684220	28690700	well let's go to our calculator and see what we have for min's and max's hitting y equals clearing
28690700	28699500	out the old function we want to do parentheses the cosine of x and we want to square it
28701340	28704940	to lead out the old values for the table
28707100	28709660	and our first point is pi over two
28714220	28723420	we get zero add n pi so we've got pi over two plus one pi
28723500	28732460	we get zero again and pi over two plus two pi
28734620	28741500	we get zero again and again so what we see is each of these guys is going to give us zero for a height
28745260	28748780	let's try the other ones let's just try pi and plus n pi
28749740	28754780	from our second from the sine so just pi pi is equal to one
28757900	28767900	what if we do pi plus pi pi plus one pi also equal to one what about pi plus two pi
28767900	28778060	also equal to one what we see is each of these always equals two one
28779020	28783420	so we're going to have not an absolute max or an absolute min because it doesn't
28783420	28789980	peak out but we do get these relative maximums and relative minimums so we can say the relative
28790220	28804060	or not relative but local local minimum at x equals pi or let's say local minimum of
28805660	28811420	zero at x equals pi over two plus n pi
28811580	28819180	where n is an element of the integers and we have a local maximum
28821100	28827020	of one at x equals pi plus n pi
28829020	28831180	where n is an element of the integers again
28832060	28842220	just to kind of see what's happening here if I were to actually graph this let's adjust our window
28845740	28852220	window let's go from negative six pi
28853180	28855020	to pi
28857740	28859820	and I want to label every pi over two
28862860	28866540	min I'm going to do a minimum of negative two and a maximum of two
28869500	28875980	and when I graph it you see every pi over two there's either a local min or a local max
28876300	28885340	I didn't do the window I wanted but it gets the idea here as we get a local min or a local max
28885340	28890460	every pi over two based on what we just found and we know the heights one and the heights are zero
28893100	28899900	so that's the big idea for today is the extreme value theorem that if f is continuous all we
28899900	28906540	need to do is find the critical points and check the edges and one of those is going to be the local
28906540	28912540	min or the absolute min and one of those is going to be the absolute max take a look at it on the
28912540	28918540	homework today and we will see you in class to talk about the extreme value theorem a little bit more
28920220	28924620	today we're going to take a look at what's called the mean value theorem the mean value theorem
28924620	28932700	takes a look at answering the question when is the instantaneous
28937820	28938940	rate of change
28942540	28950380	or the rate of change at any specific moment equal to the average
28951340	28954620	rate of change
28959820	28965740	so for example if you go on a hour long trip and you average 40 miles an hour on that trip
28966780	28971980	when were you actually driving 40 miles an hour sometimes you're driving faster sometimes you
28971980	28977900	are driving slower but when were you actually equal to the 40 miles an hour or your average
28977900	28982540	for the entire trip and this is what the mean value theorem finds for us
28986220	28987500	the mean value theorem
28989900	28991740	or sometimes called MVT
28994620	28999980	first before we can use the mean value theorem there are two requirements
29000380	29012140	that must be meant and if either of these are not true the mean value theorem does not apply
29013580	29016140	first the function must be continuous
29019500	29022300	on the range we're talking about from a to b
29024620	29028060	and second it must be differential
29030460	29035180	on that same range from a to b
29037900	29044220	if the function is continuous between two numbers and is differentiable on those two
29044220	29052540	numbers or between those two numbers then we can say that there exists
29052540	29056940	at least
29059180	29062620	one point c
29065420	29066460	that is between
29069100	29069660	a and b
29072620	29073260	such that
29073740	29084220	the derivative at that point is equal to the rate of change or the slope
29085660	29090460	the f of b minus f of a over b minus a
29096700	29100700	maybe to help us see this it might help to see it graphically what we're talking about
29103980	29107180	graphically what we're saying is
29109180	29116860	if I take a curve that goes from one point around up into another point
29117900	29124700	from a to b where we've got f of a
29124940	29135660	and f of b on the y-axis if I was to connect the point directly from a to b with a straight line
29136620	29142380	that slope is going to be my average rate of change between the two points
29143660	29151340	and what the mean value theorem states is that there is at least one point then in between them
29151340	29160300	called c where this tangent line is parallel in other words the instantaneous rate of change
29160300	29165340	at that point is the same as the average between a and b in fact you might notice that there's
29165340	29173180	two points on this graph that give us a parallel slope so maybe we could call them c1 and c2
29173180	29179740	this this graph actually has two points where the slope is equal to the average slope between
29179740	29184780	the two points that's what the mean value theorem states is that there's a point in the middle
29184780	29189740	that has the same tangent slope as the secant from a to b
29195020	29204460	so first I mentioned the requirements of the mean value theorem it's always important to check
29205100	29212060	the requirements is it differentiable is it continuous
29215020	29219020	so we could ask the question does the mean value theorem
29222460	29222940	apply
29228060	29231500	or maybe it'd be better to say when does the mean value theorem apply
29231500	29233820	let's change it to that when does
29237980	29240540	the mean value theorem apply
29243260	29251900	to y equals the square root of x squared minus x minus two
29252780	29265340	well we could take the derivative of just about any point and it's continuous at just about every
29265340	29273580	point except for one important point or one important thing what's under the square root
29273580	29280940	must always be greater than or equal to zero so what we're really saying is x squared minus x minus
29280940	29287260	two must be greater than or equal to zero for the mean value theorem to apply because that's the
29287260	29294620	only time it's actually continuous well if we factor that we get x minus two times x plus one
29294620	29300300	is greater than or equal to zero and so we find out we've got these two potential solutions of two
29300300	29305820	and negative one and we want to know when those solutions are positive specifically
29306460	29314780	so if I make a little graph here you can see we've got a zero at negative one and zero at two
29315420	29321660	it's an x squared graph so we should know it's a parabola and specifically we want the graph to be
29321660	29328380	positive we know it's positive on the left and the right but negative in the center when it's
29328380	29335660	negative in the center the graph's not continuous so the range when the mean value theorem applies
29335900	29340620	when it's actually continuous is from negative infinity to negative one
29342380	29345420	and actually we'll include the negative one because it's continuous at zero
29348780	29357180	union from two to infinity these are the points on which our
29357900	29363500	graph is positive the graph of what's under the square root is positive meaning we can actually
29363500	29369020	take the square root it's actually continuous on those points so those are the only ranges when
29369020	29379020	the mean value theorem would apply we could even ask more directly does the mean value theorem apply
29379340	29394460	to maybe y equals the natural log of 5x minus one over the interval from zero to three
29400860	29406940	well we know the domain of the natural log what's inside the natural log must be greater than zero
29406940	29413260	it can't even be equal to zero so what we need to check is 5x minus one greater than zero going to
29413260	29420140	put us outside of the range of zero to three that this problem's interested in add one
29421260	29427740	5x is greater than one divide by five x is must be greater than one fifth
29427740	29437580	so we would say no the mean value theorem does not apply apply because it is undefined
29440540	29448460	from zero to one fifth if we are just going from one to three the mean value theorem would work
29448460	29453340	because it's defined on all those points it's continuous on all those points but because
29453340	29462860	it's discontinuous from zero to one fifth the mean value theorem will not apply over the range of zero
29462860	29472460	to three let's try another one y equals e to the three x squared minus one
29473260	29486300	with e and with x squared and with multiplication and with subtraction we know the graph is
29486300	29495420	continuous there's no jumps no breaks no holes no gaps it's also differentiable on the entire graph
29496300	29500460	the derivative we'd have to use a nice little chain rule but if we took the derivative
29500460	29507180	it would be e to the three x squared minus one times the derivative of the top stuff which is 6x
29510060	29517420	and the minus one goes to zero but this is also defined on all points so there's nowhere this is
29517420	29524380	not this is discontinuous there's nowhere where this is not differentiable i didn't even give the
29524380	29530460	range but let's just give it one because i should have let's say over negative two to two definitely
29530460	29536700	between negative two and two this is all defined so we would say yes the mean value theorem is going
29536700	29544940	to apply to this function on this range which means between negative two and two the average rate of
29544940	29553340	change can be found as an instantaneous rate of change we don't know where but we definitely know
29553340	29563980	it exists okay then let's see now that we've checked the requirements let's see if we can use
29564540	29573340	the mean value theorem first we're going to do it kind of visually i want to graph
29573420	29585100	graph this function and connect the a and b and then show tangent lines
29588220	29594220	there's at least one there might be more so i'll put the s in parentheses with the same slope
29595180	29607980	so the graph we're working with is f of x equals x cubed minus 6x squared plus 8x
29614300	29620860	so let's take an x out to try and graph it gives us x squared minus 6x plus 8
29621820	29633260	continuing to factor that's x minus 2 times x minus 4 and so we have zeros at x equals 0, 2, and 4
29637900	29643580	and so we should be able to graph this before we graph this let's go ahead and figure out what the
29644540	29652380	slope is between the points between the edges i didn't even give a range let's do the range on
29652380	29665020	negative one to six so let's find f of negative one and f of six and we'll have our calculator help
29665020	29681260	with that just to make it a little quicker we have x cubed minus 6x squared plus 8x
29683100	29689980	and i'll go to my table let's delete out the values we don't want at negative one it's equal to negative 15
29690300	29695820	and at six it's equal to 48
29698460	29704780	so we had negative 15 and 48 so this graph's not going to be really to scale
29705900	29712860	but at negative one and then one two three four five six up here is going to be 48
29713660	29719660	which means we've got about negative 15 down here somewhere
29723820	29725980	we have a zero at zero
29728140	29733660	two and four we know at six it's equal to 48
29735260	29741340	and at negative one it's negative 15 so this graph's going to come in go up go down and up
29743180	29748780	but what this problem really wants us to do is connect the end points with this line
29751980	29756620	and then go ahead and just show graphically that we can draw a parallel line that's tangent
29758220	29763740	to the graph at least at one point and you notice there's two points where those lines are parallel
29763740	29767740	probably a little too steep there well too far the other direction
29767740	29774300	uh tricky there we go
29776460	29782780	parallel lines same slope tangent to the points on the graph between
29783660	29787180	our a and our b between negative one and negative six
29790940	29795340	but just doing it graphically is a little boring let's actually find the points
29795340	29799020	let's find the points
29802220	29811100	c where we get that average rate of change is equal to the instantaneous rate of change
29811100	29819020	or f prime of c the derivative at c is f of b minus f of a over b minus a
29819820	29828380	and let's go ahead and do the same function that we did up above we're going to do f of x
29829020	29837260	equals x cubed minus six x squared plus eight x on the same range of negative one comma six
29837260	29843100	and we're trying to find these black dots that we just found where are those points
29843740	29847980	that we're going to get the same slope as the average slope
29850300	29858140	well first let's find the average slope that's f of b minus f of a over b minus a
29860300	29869820	or f of six using the endpoints minus f of negative one over six minus negative one
29869820	29874860	and we just saw that f of six is equal to 48
29877340	29886860	minus f of negative one is negative 15 over six minus negative one so we have 63
29890460	29897500	over seven which is equal to a nice pretty nine
29900700	29904860	so we want to know when the derivative is going to be equal to nine
29906940	29914300	so we're going to find the derivative f of f prime of x which is three x squared
29914300	29920940	minus 12x plus eight we want to know when that's equal to the average slope or equal to nine
29920940	29928060	well we need to subtract nine from both sides to make it equal to zero three x squared minus
29928060	29936380	12x minus one equals zero and you might see that that's not going to factor very nicely
29938780	29944540	so let's see rx then using the quadratic formula is equal to 12
29945340	29951900	plus or minus the square root of 12 squared minus four times three times negative one
29952620	29957980	all over two times three and when I do that on my calculator
29960140	29964060	I'll end up with two values first if we subtract you get negative
29965020	29972460	point zero eight and four point zero eight
29974780	29982140	so my graph's not really to scale but we would have hit those slopes at negative point zero eight
29982940	29991340	and four point zero eight so I went through and made a graph that was more to scale than the one
29991340	29996860	that we had before the red curve that you see here is our function that we've been working with
29997420	30005260	and then what I did is I put a dot at negative one comma negative 15 and six comma 48 and you
30005260	30011900	can see I've connected them with this orange line then what I did is I put a purple dot here at the
30012460	30020060	first point that we had the negative point zero eight and drew a tangent line I also put a dot at
30020060	30026300	the second point that we found at four point zero eight and drew a tangent line and you see that
30026300	30032540	those blue tangent lines are perfectly parallel to the orange tangent line and what that means is
30032540	30039020	that the instantaneous rate of change at those two points on those blue lines is equal to the
30039020	30045580	average rate of change of the orange line that connects the two endpoints and that's visually
30045580	30053900	how the mean value theorem works so our two answers do work the mean value theorem is
30056140	30059740	right there on your screen the big thing we're talking about today
30059740	30065340	is that if the function is continuous and differentiable between the two endpoints
30065340	30071340	there exist at least one point C such that the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the
30071340	30076940	average rate of change or the slope between the two points take a look at the assignment and try
30076940	30084780	a few of these and we'll take a closer look at them in class the derivatives can tell us a whole
30084780	30089980	bunch about the shape of a graph of a function and that's what we're going to look at today we're
30089980	30100140	going to answer the question what do derivatives tell us
30105340	30110940	about the shape of a graph
30110940	30124220	first thing we're going to look at is what is called the first derivative test
30129660	30133500	and to kind of set up what the first derivative test does i'm going to draw a little picture here
30133740	30140780	actually three pictures three little graphs and we're going to compare what the derivative is
30140780	30151820	doing on each so here is some function f kind of curving upwards we'll have some function f
30151820	30160460	curving downwards and then we'll have a function f that comes up to a point and we're going to
30160460	30165900	be interested particularly at a point c kind of in the middle of both of the are all three of these
30166700	30173980	and what the derivative is doing at each one of those now we know the derivative is the slope of
30173980	30181980	the tangent line at that point and so if i draw my point and the tangent line for the one that's
30181980	30189180	go increasing for the one that's curving upwards you see the slope is also going upwards in other
30189180	30202540	words if the function f of x is increasing the derivative f prime of x is positive
30206060	30213180	and similarly at the point c on the curve that's decreasing or going down you'll see that the
30213180	30225500	slope of the tangent line is going downhill it is negative so we'll say that when f of x is decreasing
30228780	30233820	the derivative f prime of x is negative
30233820	30245900	now at the peak here on the third graph you'll notice that it's neither increasing or decreasing
30246700	30250220	and in fact the tangent line is completely flat
30252620	30262540	at that point so if f of x is neither increasing nor decreasing then f prime of x
30264380	30272700	is zero which is neither positive nor negative now we recognize that point
30276140	30283100	as a point when the derivative is zero we call that a critical point we already know that critical
30283100	30291660	points are where the derivative is zero it's either a maximum or a minimum value
30294460	30303820	so let's summarize that conclusion in the actual test the first derivative test
30305740	30309580	what we're going to do with the first derivative test to learn about the function
30309580	30314140	is first we're going to find all critical points
30314300	30326700	and as a reminder that's when f prime of x is equal to zero or it's undefined
30332780	30336700	once we find those points we can use those points to divide
30336860	30343900	f prime of x into subregions
30349740	30355340	and then we can test each subregion
30358620	30363500	and we'll find out where the derivative is zero that's going to be where the graph levels out
30363500	30368220	and then we'll know in between those points is the graph increasing or decreasing
30369260	30376540	based on what the derivative is doing so let's see if we can use that test with an example here
30381100	30383980	the example we're going to play with is f of x
30384140	30393820	equals x cubed minus 12x we're going to decide where is the derivative zero where is it increasing
30393820	30400700	where is it decreasing well first we have to know the derivative f prime of x is equal to
30400700	30408300	3x squared minus 12 and to find those critical points we set it equal to zero
30408540	30415820	so if i add 12 to both sats actually let's just factor it uh let's do 3 times x squared minus
30415820	30424380	four equals zero three times x plus two times x minus two equals zero so our critical points
30424380	30430060	are x equals negative two and positive two those are our critical points
30430860	30436540	then what we're going to do is we're going to divide
30438060	30445580	kind of a number line into those subregions we've got negative two and positive two
30446140	30452140	and we know at those points the derivative is zero the graph is flat at those points
30452700	30458620	so what's f prime in those regions
30461660	30466460	the easiest way to test that is we're going to go to our calculator on the calculator we're
30466460	30471980	going to hit the y equals button and type in our derivative function so we know if the derivative
30471980	30480860	is positive or negative the derivative function was 3x squared minus 12 and we'll go to our table
30481500	30488540	second table let's delete out the old values now first we need to test a point in each of
30488540	30494540	these three regions left of negative two between negative two and positive two and right of two
30495260	30498780	so left of negative two we can pick any number let's pick negative five
30500220	30506620	and we see it's a positive 63 so left of negative two the derivative is positive
30507500	30515900	what that means is that f the function left of negative two is actually increasing
30515900	30517980	because the derivative is positive
30520540	30527100	between negative two and two let's put the number zero in it's negative 12 the derivative is negative
30527100	30534220	between which means the function itself is decreasing between negative two and two
30537100	30543420	greater than two maybe pick the number positive five it's positive all we care about is the sign
30544060	30548860	and so that tells us that it is increasing over that range
30553740	30558860	now we know where the graph is increasing decreasing and then increasing again it's
30558860	30566860	giving us a general idea of the shape of the graph but there's more to the graph than just
30566860	30573580	whether it's increasing or decreasing it helps to know what direction or how it is curving
30573580	30582060	is it curving when it goes up on this left part is it curving up or is it curving
30582060	30593500	up those are two very different curves in red there we need to know what type of curve
30593500	30600620	it's doing as it's increasing and that leads us to our next topic the next thing the derivatives
30600620	30609740	tell us about the graph and this is what we call concavity now concavity might be a new
30609740	30613420	concept to us so let's set it up first with a little bit of vocabulary
30617100	30627020	the first word we need to know is what is concave up concave up means it the graph itself
30627020	30631820	appears to be rotating counterclockwise
30640220	30647900	and if you think about a general parabola starting from the left you see it rotates counterclockwise
30647900	30653580	as you draw the parabola you also could have something approaching an asymptote kind of giving
30653580	30659340	a counterclockwise rotation or even if it was increasing a counterclockwise rotation
30659980	30664300	going from left to right you're moving around the circle counterclockwise
30666300	30670860	and that kind of makes sense counterclockwise if we think about our unit circle which we're
30670860	30677980	very familiar with we count unit circles counterclockwise so that's a positive concave up
30677980	30680220	motion going counterclockwise
30685420	30690300	another way that i like to think about concave up is if i think about the parabola it looks like
30690300	30701180	the u of concave up and that reminds me that u up is concave up as you might expect the next word
30701180	30710460	is concave down and here we are rotating clockwise
30714140	30717980	or if you think about the unit circle in the negative direction if you start from the left
30718540	30725340	a negative parabola is concave down it's going clockwise around and you could also get things
30725340	30732380	approaching asymptotes in much the similar way these all are concave down
30736140	30740460	and as you might expect with calculus we're interested in when we switch between a concave
30740460	30746780	up motion and a concave down motion just like when we switch from increasing and decreasing
30746780	30753500	we have critical points with concavity when we switch between concave up and concave down
30753500	30756940	what we end up with are called inflection points
30762380	30770940	and that is where the concavity changes
30775660	30782780	for example the graph could be first concave up and then it's going to switch to concave down
30783340	30789500	right in the center there you see the rotation direction changes starts out going clockwise
30790460	30797020	or counterclockwise then it changes to clockwise the classic x cubed also let's see this one
30797020	30804380	starts out going counterclockwise and then turning it to clockwise you start concave up and then you
30804380	30811420	change to concave down in the middle those are inflection points where the concavity changes
30813740	30819580	and just like a critical point is when the derivative is equal to zero concavity can
30819580	30825100	also be found the way we find those inflection points is we look at the second derivative
30825100	30829420	f prime prime of x and see when it's zero or undefined
30829420	30842540	now concavity tells us a whole lot when it's combined with the first derivative test and
30842540	30848460	whether the graph is increasing or decreasing let's look at concavity
30849100	30853660	and increasing
30856540	30857980	decreasing relationships
30861900	30864700	and to set this up we're going to do a little tic-tac-toe board here
30870860	30876220	and we're going to look at what happens if the graph is increasing
30878620	30893500	and it's concave up if it's increasing and concave up we have to rotate counterclockwise
30895260	30897260	as we increase
30899980	30904060	contrast that with increasing and concave down
30904620	30912220	now as we are increasing we have to rotate clockwise which takes us off in the other direction
30915260	30918540	similarly we can compare what happens when we are decreasing
30921340	30928220	if we are decreasing and we're concave up as we go down we have to rotate counterclockwise
30928700	30939900	versus if it's decreasing and concave down as we rotate it has to rotate downward clockwise
30941740	30947820	so if we know both of these facts about the graph we will very quickly know the shape of the graph
30947820	30951100	and what is going on at various points
30951740	30958380	and we test for concavity
30964060	30970620	very similar to how we test the first derivative test except instead of finding critical points
30970620	30973980	first we find inflection points
30974940	30983340	and once we find those inflection points we can divide
30985740	30990700	the second derivative f prime prime of x into subregions
30995180	30999900	and again we will test each subregion
31004220	31014940	so let's take a look at just doing that test for concavity
31014940	31016940	and then we'll bring it together here in just a minute
31020460	31025660	so number four going back to that same example we had before
31026380	31032140	where f of x is equal to x cubed minus 12x
31033660	31039020	we already said the first derivative was 3x squared minus 12
31040780	31046540	the second derivative then we can quickly calculate to be 6x
31046540	31052060	and so we're going to divide the number line
31053740	31057500	into subregions based on those inflection points
31057500	31060940	based on when that second derivative equals zero
31062860	31067340	we'll divide both sides by six and x equals zero is my inflection point
31068060	31080060	and so rate at zero is where we are going to split up the f prime prime to see what's happening
31080700	31084380	where is the second derivative positive and negative
31085660	31088860	going to y equals now i'm going to clear out the second derivative
31089420	31093180	or the first derivative we'll put in the second derivative equation which is just 6x
31093420	31097900	and then go to the table to lead out what i don't need
31098780	31103100	and i might have been able to do this in my head in fact i should be able to do this one in my
31103100	31107180	head but just to show you for the more complex equations i'm going to test something to the
31107180	31113340	left of zero maybe negative five and i see the second derivative is zero is negative
31115740	31119740	then we'll test something to the right of zero maybe positive five
31119740	31122700	and we'll see the second derivative is positive
31125580	31129980	so we've divided into subregions we know where the second derivative is positive and negative
31130540	31136140	now we know if our function the original function x cubed minus 12 is concave up or concave down
31137900	31141260	we see on the left it's negative so it is concave
31141820	31150700	down to begin with up until zero where it becomes concave up
31155580	31159980	so we know on the left it's going to have some type of clockwise motion
31159980	31164300	on the right it's going to have some type of counterclockwise motion kind of run out of space
31171980	31176860	okay now that we know how these tests all work
31180620	31185180	let's bring it all together
31191420	31195100	with our function f of x equals x cubed minus 12x
31196060	31204460	the first derivative which i'm going to always represent in blue here is 3x squared minus 12
31206300	31211900	and we know if we make that equal to zero we found out earlier that gave us critical points
31211900	31220380	at negative two and positive two the second derivative i'm going to represent now in green
31221340	31229100	is going to be 6x which when we made that equal to zero that gave us inflection point at zero
31233180	31238540	i strongly encourage you color code your critical points and your inflection points
31238540	31243100	so you don't get them confused as you're breaking up into subregions here
31243900	31253900	we know we've got critical points at negative two and two so these guys are going to split
31253900	31265260	up my f prime my first derivative i've got an inflection point at zero so that's how i'm going
31265260	31272140	to split up the second derivative of f prime prime and ultimately we're interested in what's
31272140	31277180	happening to our function f in each of these regions there's not actually a lot of space to the
31277180	31284540	left so i'm going to rewrite that give myself give myself a little more space f f prime and f prime
31284540	31294460	prime okay first in green to the left of zero we found out the second derivative was negative
31294620	31303820	so we know it's going to be concave down to the right of zero we found out that the second
31303820	31309660	derivative was positive and so we know there that the graph is concave up
31313340	31318940	in blue in the middle the first derivative to the left of two now we're looking at the blue lines
31318940	31324540	ignoring the green lines to the left of two we found out the second derivative was positive
31325980	31334060	which meant the graph is increasing between negative two and positive two we found out the
31334060	31341020	second derivative was negative which means the graph is decreasing between those points
31341980	31351180	to the right of two we found out that the second that the first derivative was positive and so we
31351180	31360780	know the graph is increasing so now at the very top in red we should have an idea what the graph
31360780	31371340	of f is doing left of negative two we see that we're concave down and increasing
31373340	31381500	so concave down and increasing the graph is going to curve clockwise while increasing
31382140	31391820	then between negative two and zero we see it's still concave down but it's decreasing
31393340	31399020	decreasing in concave down is going to go clockwise and downward
31401900	31409820	but after zero we're still decreasing but the graph is concave up which means it's going to
31409820	31414940	rotate its curve to be concave up as it's decreasing
31417980	31427740	to the right of two it is concave up and increasing so we're rotating counterclockwise
31427740	31436700	as we increase now we have a lot better idea of what's happening with this graph
31437580	31441100	let's see if we can actually make our graph
31449020	31453580	and i'm not going to put anything on the y-axis yet because we don't quite have those
31454460	31459100	what we do know about the graph is and i'm going to put a little dotted line
31459180	31467180	it's not it's just to kind of mark right there now negative two is going to be some type of
31467180	31472540	critical point so i should expect it to level off when it hits the blue line at two is another
31472540	31478700	critical point so i should expect it to level off when it hits that blue line
31480540	31485740	and then at zero is going to be my inflection point where the rotation changes
31485740	31491980	okay we know our graph increases and rotates clockwise up to a critical point
31494220	31499900	then it's going to decrease continuing to rotate clockwise until it hits an inflection
31499900	31504860	point where the rotation should change but it should still be decreasing
31506300	31513980	until it hits a critical point and then we keep rotating counterclockwise as we increase
31516540	31521260	and i want to notice all the elements of our graph it starts out increasing
31522700	31526620	then it's decreasing then it's increasing
31528860	31536860	it starts out rotating clockwise until the inflection point when it rotates counterclockwise
31537980	31541740	giving us the concave down on the left and concave up on the right
31541900	31551500	and this is how the derivatives can help us get a very good idea of the shape of the function
31553100	31557980	try a few of these on your own come back to class ready to discuss them and we will see you then
31559980	31564140	now that we've taken a look at concavity and increasing and decreasing functions
31564140	31568460	we've just got a little bit to add to our conversation as we look at how
31571980	31572860	do we graph
31577420	31577980	functions
31581580	31582460	with calculus
31588540	31596380	and the main missing piece we have right now is what happens with limits at infinity
31601980	31608860	basically what happens is we take the limit as x goes to infinity of our function f of x
31610140	31616860	or what happens as the limit as x goes to negative infinity of our function f of x
31618700	31621820	and the big idea we look for here is we consider
31625820	31627580	kind of a who takes over
31631740	31637820	as x gets large
31641580	31652220	so for example if i wanted to do the limit as x goes to infinity of 3x squared minus 7x
31652780	31661420	plus 5 all over 5x cubed plus 2x squared minus 7
31663740	31668140	who's going to take over in this case well in the numerator
31669420	31675020	the 3x squared will take over because x squared is bigger than any x or any constant
31675020	31678300	so when we square really big numbers it's going to become huge
31679100	31685500	and in the denominator the x cubed is going to take over because it's got the highest exponent
31685500	31691340	in fact what we could also say is that the x cubed is going to get bigger
31694780	31701980	faster than the numerator what we're really saying is the numerator is going to be whatever
31701980	31710460	it becomes but the denominator is going to become the biggest part of this function that 5x cubed
31710460	31716220	is just going to become huge faster than any other part of this function well if we take any old
31716220	31722940	number and divide it by just a huge number as x gets close to infinity dividing by a huge number
31722940	31728860	is going to basically leave nothing left and you can see that this limit as x goes to infinity
31728860	31731820	is basically going to equal zero
31734540	31739100	similarly if i wanted to look at the limit as x goes to infinity
31740860	31750700	of 3x cubed minus 5x plus 1 over 1x cubed plus 6x minus 2
31752540	31757740	similarly we can see in the numerator the x cubed the 3x cubed begins to take over the
31757740	31763740	numerator as it becomes huge and in the denominator the regular x cubed takes over
31765340	31770060	but as we can see neither one of those is going to get bigger faster
31771980	31778700	so essentially they are going to get bigger at the same rate because whatever we cube in
31778700	31786140	the numerator we're also cubing in the denominator and essentially that part that's cubed will reduce
31786140	31796540	or divide out the x cubes divide out leaving behind on the biggest part 3 over 1 or in this
31796540	31804300	case just the number 3 because the x cubes ultimately as they become huge divide out
31804300	31809500	and everything else is too small to worry about we're just left with 3
31809500	31815180	compare that
31817580	31823660	with the limit as x goes to let's do negative infinity this time
31826300	31837340	of 6x minus 2 over the square root of 4x squared plus 3x i'm going to scroll up a bit
31837340	31838540	so we can see better
31844300	31852780	the numerator we can see the 6x takes over that's six times some huge negative number
31852780	31861580	which means that 6x becomes a large negative in the numerator
31862540	31866540	square in the denominator the 4x squared takes over
31868620	31874060	but we're taking the square root of that and so that becomes the square root of 4x squared taking
31874060	31887500	over but notice that reduces to 2x and because we square the negative that's x squared the negative
31887500	31894380	squared becomes a positive so 2x is actually a large positive number
31898460	31904700	and that again is because the x squared makes that part positive times a positive is positive
31904700	31911340	and the square root is still positive so ultimately what we've ended up with
31911500	31920780	is the x's 6x over 2x where the x's can essentially divide out
31923180	31930540	but not the negative the negative is still there as x goes to negative infinity the
31930540	31937740	numerator is going to go to negative 6 while the denominator goes to 2 giving us a final
31938700	31944300	limit at infinity of negative 3
31946780	31952620	and this is kind of the game we keep playing as we look at solving these limits at infinity
31953180	31960300	we look at who's taking over what's happening 2x as it gets huge whether positive or negative
31960300	31967420	and we have to be very careful with what's happening with the signs is it positive or negative
31968540	31977500	so if i want the limit as x goes to infinity of x cubed minus 6x over x squared plus 5
31980140	31986060	again in the numerator the x cubed is going to take over in the denominator the x squared is
31986060	31992940	going to take over but what you see is they're not growing at the same rate this time the numerator
31992940	32002460	grows faster because cubed is going to get huge faster than squared will get huge
32003500	32008780	and so similar to our first example we're going to end up with a big number divided by something
32008780	32014460	that's much smaller that's not growing at the same rate so if i take a huge number and divide it by
32014460	32021340	something small i'm still going to be huge and so in this case this one's actually going to keep
32021340	32035180	getting bigger up to infinity we need this concept of the limit as x goes to infinity
32035180	32040620	to see what's happening with the in behavior or on the far left or the far right of the graph
32041580	32046700	the first example we took a look at on the far edge of the graph to the right towards infinity
32047340	32054220	this graph is approaching an asymptote at zero the second example at infinity is approaching an
32054220	32062780	asymptote at three the third example at negative infinity is approaching an asymptote at negative
32062780	32069420	three well the fourth example is not approaching an asymptote at all it's just going off to infinity
32069420	32077420	forever getting bigger we're going to combine this concept of limits at infinity with all the other
32077420	32095820	stuff we've seen about graphing a function so first our general strategy let's get everything
32095820	32103660	down in one place that we know about how to graph a function first it's helpful to find the domain
32105580	32111500	where is the graph or the function undefined do we have a hole do we have a vertical asymptote
32111500	32118300	what's going on with the domain the second thing that we found back in pre-calculus days was we
32118300	32123100	found the x and y intercepts
32131500	32140220	then we're going to add what we talked about today which is finding the limit as x goes to
32140220	32149660	infinity of f of x and the limit as x goes to negative infinity of f of x because that's going
32149660	32154140	to tell us the end behavior or what's happening at the edge of the graph does it approach an
32154140	32163340	asymptote or does it go off to infinity speaking of asymptotes we can also find any vertical asymptotes
32170700	32178460	those are going to come from the domain not the holes the holes and the vertical asymptotes come
32178460	32183820	from the domain but specifically the vertical asymptotes will want to label if there are any
32186220	32192620	then using and i'm going to always do this one in blue using f prime of x
32193500	32200220	identify the critical points
32205660	32208460	and increasing
32211500	32215260	decreasing regions
32216140	32224300	that's what we talked about in our previous video from section 4.5 the first derivative test
32225500	32234140	then using and i'll always do this in green f prime prime of x or the second derivative
32234140	32240380	identify inflection points
32246460	32254780	and concavity is it concave up or concave down and when we put all this together we
32254780	32260060	should have a very good idea of what this graph looks like before ever touching the
32260060	32266380	graph button on our calculator so let's see if we can work through one example
32269660	32276300	and graph f of x equals x cubed minus 3x plus 2
32279820	32283100	and i'll work through all the pieces we just talked about first the domain
32283420	32292460	there's cubing adding subtracting multiplying here no restrictions on those the domain is
32292460	32299580	all real numbers so nothing fancy there to find x intercepts
32303180	32308460	we set the whole thing equal to zero i should do a different color here
32309180	32317900	let's say zero equals x cubed minus 3x plus 2 and i'm going to use the rational root theorem
32317900	32324060	and synthetic division to find these zeros the options are plus or minus one and plus or minus
32324060	32331820	two so let's try first x equals one one zero negative three and two don't forget the zero for the x
32331820	32338940	squared bring down the one bring down the one one times one is one negative two
32339740	32346540	oops getting ahead of myself negative two and zero so that did work so x equals one
32347260	32356940	is a zero and now i have one x squared plus one x minus two equals zero which is x plus two times
32356940	32364780	x minus one bring down the other factor that we got of x plus one
32369100	32371500	oops not x plus one we got to subtract one from both sides
32374940	32381340	so that's x minus one and since we've got two matching guys we're going to say that
32382140	32392380	x plus two times x minus one squared equals zero so x is equal to negative two and positive one
32392380	32402300	those are the x intercepts for the y intercepts the y intercepts we only have to make the x is all
32402300	32409660	equal to zero so we get zero cubed minus three times zero plus two which is two so y equals
32409660	32427180	two is our y intercept part c is to look at the limit and i'm going to scroll up to give us a
32427180	32436860	little more room as x goes to infinity of our function x cubed minus three x plus two
32438700	32443980	and you see the x cube takes over so if we cube infinity what we end up with
32445820	32453340	is just infinity but we also need to consider the other limit as x goes to negative infinity
32453340	32457820	off the left of our graph of x cubed minus three x plus two
32460380	32464460	again the x cube takes over because it gets bigger faster than anything else
32464460	32469900	but this time we're cubing a negative large number when we cube a negative large number
32469900	32477020	we'll get a negative larger number so this on the left side is going to go to negative infinity
32477740	32481820	so we know from the left it's towards negative infinity and it's going to exit on the right
32481820	32494460	towards positive infinity vertical asymptotes vertical asymptotes come from um
32496060	32497900	let me write down vertical asymptotes
32501980	32507100	vertical asymptotes come from when the denominator equals zero but we have no fraction here with
32507100	32513180	this function so there are none with fractions you'll have to be careful of those
32515740	32521420	e is our first derivative test finding the critical points and where it's increasing or decreasing
32522140	32533740	so f of x again was x cubed minus three x plus two so our derivative is three x squared minus three
32534460	32543740	and we find our critical points by making it equal to zero factor out of three x squared minus one
32545900	32554060	x plus one x minus one so our critical points are negative one and positive one
32554300	32564300	we're going to combine that with the information from part f which is the second derivative
32567980	32572460	the first derivative we already have so taking the second derivative there is six x
32574780	32579900	set that equal to zero and so x is equal to zero becomes an inflection point
32584060	32588940	now for the sake of our graph it's going to be helpful to know uh well actually let's
32589820	32595420	over here to the right first let's make our number line we're going to break it up with an inflection
32595420	32603180	point at zero and a critical point at negative one and positive one
32606380	32613020	so the critical point split it up into three regions the inflection point splits it into two regions
32614300	32623580	so we can consider what's happening with f prime prime f prime and ultimately learn about f
32625660	32633180	okay on my calculator here i'm going to hit y equals in y one i'm going to type in the original
32633180	32637740	function because it's going to give me some key points that i'm going to want to actually know
32637740	32649820	their exact coordinates so in y one my first the function is x cubed minus three x plus two
32651740	32657260	my y two this is the first derivative three x squared minus three
32659820	32663740	y three is my second derivative of six x
32664060	32670380	and now i'm going to go second table and delete out this information i don't want
32672060	32677260	first thing i'm going to do is figure out the exact coordinates of the critical points and
32677260	32685020	the inflection points my critical points were at negative one and one and the inflection point is
32685020	32694140	at zero what's nice is that gives me the coordinates of negative four one and one zero as my critical
32694140	32702620	points so we have negative one comma four and one comma zero as my critical points
32703820	32707900	we're going to need those in a minute and the other thing we pulled off the calculator was
32707900	32713980	that the inflection point zero is at zero comma two we're going to need that inflection point
32713980	32722540	here in just a minute now let's see if we can learn what's happening in each of the regions
32723980	32729740	that we've mapped out here for our graph actually what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to y equals
32730700	32736140	and i'm going to highlight the equals on y one because i don't care about f right now
32736140	32742060	i just care about uh what's happening with the first derivative and the second derivative
32742060	32748620	so if i highlight the equals and hit enter you'll see it's no longer highlighted now when i go to
32748620	32756300	second table it's just going to tell me y two and y three so first for the second derivative
32757020	32762060	that's in the third column there the second derivative we need something to the left of zero
32762780	32764300	about negative five
32767260	32772780	to the left of zero you see y three the second derivative is negative
32775580	32785740	so my second derivative is negative it is concave down to begin with it's rotating clockwise to begin
32785740	32796140	with to the right maybe at positive five you see the second derivative is y three it's positive
32796140	32802060	so it's positive on the right which means it's concave up
32806620	32811580	now let's go to the blue the first derivative we want to know if it's positive or negative
32811580	32819180	so we know if it's increasing or decreasing y two has my first derivative in it so i'm looking at
32819180	32825340	this column first we need something to the left of negative one we already have negative five
32825900	32834380	and notice it's a positive number so it starts out positive which means it is increasing initially
32834380	32842220	something between negative one and one would be zero notice the derivative is negative
32843340	32847180	so it's negative which means it's decreasing until the next critical point
32849980	32854460	something to the right of one we could use the number five that we already have which is positive
32855900	32858380	so we know it's increasing after that point
32859340	32867020	then we're going to put this all together to decide with increasing decreasing concave up and
32867020	32874060	concave down what's the general shape in each of these four regions starting out concave down
32874620	32883260	counterclockwise rotation but increasing we know our graph starts going up with a clockwise rotation
32883980	32891740	still concave down after the critical point but now decreasing it's going to go down with that concave
32892300	32899260	down motion from the bottom of that though after zero after that inflection point it needs to be
32899260	32905660	concave up but still decreasing so you'll start to see the rotation go counterclockwise after zero
32906620	32915260	but then start increasing after the critical point at one still concave up and so we can
32915260	32919900	kind of see the shape the direction it's going to go kind of like an upside down parabola it's
32919900	32926540	going to turn to an upside up parabola notice it exits at negative infinity on the left like we
32926540	32932700	expect it goes off to positive infinity on the right like we'd expect we're going to put all
32932700	32937580	this information together to make our final big graph
32951260	32954780	all right first let's go through our list of things we discovered
32955740	32959900	the domains all real numbers but we have x intercepts at negative two and one
32960620	32966140	we did those in purple we had x intercepts at negative two and positive one
32968060	32975580	we also have a y intercept at two so at two there's a y intercept
32979020	32985100	we know on the left it's going off at negative infinity on the right it's going off at positive
32985100	32994620	infinity we also know that there is a critical point and i'm going to do this in blue so i don't
32994620	33003180	miss my colors critical points at negative one four and a critical point at one comma zero
33004540	33006220	which is also one of our intercepts
33006460	33018860	we also know there's an inflection point at zero comma two which is also one of our intercepts
33018860	33024060	but that is an inflection point where it's going to switch rotation from positive
33024860	33029340	oops start sorry it starts negative from a negative rotation to a positive rotation
33030300	33038540	so we should see it comes in from the negative starts out increasing with a negative rotation
33038540	33044940	hits the critical point and now it's decreasing but once it hits that inflection point the rotation
33044940	33054060	is going to change direction hits the critical point and now it's increasing and now we've got
33054060	33063260	our graph of our function notice just like we expected the first derivative told us it starts
33063260	33070700	increasing then decreasing then increasing the second derivative says it's concave down or a
33070700	33077100	negative rotation then concave up or a positive rotation switching at that inflection point
33077340	33087740	and that is how we can graph our functions using calculus there's a lot of pieces so you do need
33087740	33093100	to practice this so take a look at the book the assignment and we'll see you in class to discuss
33093100	33100860	this further all this conversation around graphs the shapes of graphs when the derivative equals
33100860	33107580	zero to find key points has a very important application and that is in what we call the
33107580	33115100	applied optimization problems so our question that we're going to attempt to answer is how
33117580	33120540	do we optimize
33123500	33127180	or find the most efficient the fastest the biggest the smallest
33127900	33133660	how do we optimize a value of interest
33137980	33147260	and ultimately what we're really asking is when does the derivative equal zero because that's the
33147260	33152780	peak or the valley that's the optimal point for the most efficient or most profit or at least
33152780	33159500	expense or shortest distance or shortest time that we're trying to get after so let's take a look
33159500	33164460	at a few of these classic optimization problems and then from there you should be able to solve
33164460	33170300	lots of different types of optimization problems the first classic problem is what we call the
33170300	33181820	rectangle problem where we're generally trying to either minimize the perimeter maximize the area
33182700	33185980	something related to that effect so let's say a farmer
33189580	33194780	has 80 feet of fencing
33197420	33202060	to enclose a pasture
33206860	33210060	along a rock wall
33211820	33218700	what that means is he only has to actually fence three sides of the wall not all four sides of the
33218700	33222060	wall so what dimensions
33227980	33234380	would maximize the area
33241740	33245980	so let's draw a picture to kind of see what's going on we've got this rock wall already
33245980	33248940	and what this farmer is going to do is he's going to make a fence
33250780	33255340	that goes alongside that rock wall so he's really only fencing three sides
33255340	33259820	and we need to give variables to the sides as we calculate the area because that's what we want
33259820	33267260	to maximize so we'll say it's an x by y fence which means the other side's also x if we're
33267260	33274460	thinking about perimeter and we know that the area of any rectangle is equal to the length times the
33274460	33284060	width or in this case x times the y but that gives us two variables so we need to constrain
33284060	33289340	one of those variables so that we can switch reduce it down to one variable and that's going
33289340	33297020	to come from the limit we're given is that we have 80 feet of fencing available to us well if
33297020	33305580	there's 80 feet available to us that means the total distance x plus y plus x or 2x plus y
33306700	33309980	that total distance has to equal the 80 feet of fencing
33312700	33316940	well the easiest variable to solve for here would probably be y so we'll subtract 2x
33317740	33325500	and we'll say that y is equal to 80 minus 2x and we'll replace the y in our area formula
33327020	33330620	to be 80 minus the 2x
33333500	33340300	to make life easier we'll go ahead and distribute so area is equal to 80x minus 2x squared
33342300	33348060	and we want to maximize this area so if we think about maybe the graph of the area the area is
33348060	33353900	going to increase to a certain point and then come down after that point we're looking to find that
33353900	33361260	maximum point and we know at that point the slope of the derivative is equal to zero
33363020	33370380	so let's find the derivative of the area in terms of x the derivative of the area is equal to 80
33370380	33378220	minus 4x and we just need to make that equal to zero to find the critical point where this fence
33378220	33388780	area is optimized add the 4x to both sides and 80 equals 4x divide both sides by 4 and x is equal to 20
33392540	33397580	now that we know where that maximum occurs we plug that in for x and the y equals equation
33397580	33404700	y equals 80 minus 2 times 20 or 80 minus 40 which is 40
33406620	33412860	so for the farmer to maximize the area of his three-sided fence along the rock wall
33413420	33419980	he should do a 20 foot by 40 foot fence
33419980	33429020	and I think fence actually has a c in it
33432700	33437980	20 foot by 40 foot fence and that's the idea of the rectangle problem
33439740	33444540	let's try another problem this is probably one of the most classic problems of all calculus
33444540	33449580	what I'm going to call the run and swim problem
33457180	33460940	and rather than write this all out I'm just going to kind of draw a picture and narrate
33460940	33468700	what I'm talking about we've got this river that's water does that look like a river
33468780	33474300	we've got this river and a person is on one side of the river
33476940	33481500	and he wants maybe a pot of gold that's on the other side of the river
33485340	33487900	it is going to be nine miles down the river
33489420	33495260	is where that pot of gold is but the river is also two miles wide
33496140	33503420	what this person can do is he's going to run along the river aways
33505820	33510860	then he's going to jump in the water and swim diagonally across aways
33517580	33521820	what we want to know is how far should he run so we'll call the running x
33522300	33531100	before he starts swimming in order to get to that pot of gold in the most efficient quickest way
33531100	33538620	possible well we need to know a few things about this person let's say the person runs
33541020	33547900	six miles per hour and swims three miles per hour
33552140	33561980	so how far should the person run that's right at the question how far should the person
33564860	33571900	run before swimming
33572620	33581500	well let's see if we can get a little more information on this
33584300	33590540	the swim distance let's call that swim distance y so we've got it labeled and then
33591980	33597500	we're going to have this gap here on this right triangle we already know the height of the triangles
33597500	33603980	two but that gap if the total distance from the person to the pot of gold is nine and he runs
33603980	33611020	or she runs x it's going to be nine minus x is what's going to be left horizontally
33616540	33618620	let's give ourselves a little bit more workspace
33621340	33625500	well we should remember that the formula for distance is equal to rate
33625500	33631420	times time and we're trying to minimize the time so let's go ahead and solve this for time
33631420	33635820	and we'll say time is equal to the total distance divided by the rate
33641020	33643980	and we know that the person is going to be running
33646700	33650780	at a rate of six miles per hour so the run time
33651020	33658860	is going to be the distance we don't know x divided by the rate or six miles per hour
33661580	33668540	while the swim time is going to be the distance divided by the rate the swim time the y the
33668540	33676220	diagonal we don't know or the swim distance the y the diagonal we don't know but we do know the
33676220	33684620	rate at which the person swims is three miles per hour so the total time is equal to the
33684620	33692860	sum of these things x over six plus y over three the other thing we're going to use to our advantage
33692860	33699740	is we have a right triangle formed on the edge of the river
33700220	33711580	Pythagorean theorem tells us that nine minus x squared plus the height which is two squared
33714220	33717260	is equal to the swim distance which is y squared
33720780	33725340	doing a little simplifying squaring the two gives us four but we want to get rid of the
33725340	33732220	y squared so taking the square root of both sides we'll have nine minus x squared plus four
33732780	33740780	under the square root is equal to y so let's replace the y in our time equation
33742540	33751100	with that information time is equal to x over six plus the square root of nine minus x squared
33751100	33753980	plus four over three
33757900	33764860	this time is what we want to minimize in other words the graph here is going to come down
33764860	33772460	to some point and we need to find out what point has a slope of zero on its tangent line
33775420	33780380	and the way we do that is we take the derivative and set the derivative equal to zero
33781900	33786060	square roots are a little bit more work to take the derivative of so let's actually rewrite this
33786060	33795660	with a one half power so we have x over six plus the nine minus x squared plus four to the one
33795660	33803020	half power over three because that's going to be easier to take a derivative of
33803900	33816540	so the derivative of the time the derivative of x over six is just one over six plus
33819820	33825420	let's make a big fraction and we'll do this piece by piece first the one-thirds a constant
33825420	33832700	so that's going to be out front we can bring the exponent of one half out front as we take
33832700	33837100	the derivative which means we've got a two in the denominator and a one in the numerator
33839820	33845020	then we reduce the exponent by one which makes it to the negative one half power
33846060	33850780	the negative one half power the negative exponent moves it down to the denominator
33850780	33858300	so now we've got nine minus x squared plus four to the one half but in the denominator
33858300	33859820	because of the negative exponent
33863020	33867020	then we have to multiply by the derivative of the inside using our chain rule
33868220	33874540	so we've got this little piece the nine minus x squared that we can take the derivative of
33874540	33879020	brings the two out front times the nine minus x
33881580	33884540	reduce the exponent by one just leaves nine minus x
33885340	33888060	and then we have to multiply by the derivative of inside that
33889420	33892620	and the derivative of negative x is negative one
33896780	33902060	let's see if we can clean that up a little bit what I notice is we've got two's that divide out
33902060	33902780	which is nice
33906300	33913020	so oh let's take this negative and do a positive times a negative is a negative so we've got one
33913020	33919980	sixth minus we're left with the nine minus x in the numerator
33921100	33929260	let's do this in brown actually it's a better color we've got one sixth minus nine minus x is
33929260	33932540	left in the numerator and that's it so I don't really need the parentheses
33935820	33941100	over three and let's go ahead and take that one half and make it back into a square root
33941100	33946380	times nine minus x squared plus four
33949500	33955900	and we know when this derivative equals zero we've got our minimum time
33958780	33962620	switch over to purple we're going to add that first fraction to the other that second
33962620	33971820	fraction to the other side giving us one sixth equals nine minus x over three square roots
33972860	33975180	of nine minus x squared plus four
33979580	33986460	we now have two equal fractions we can solve two equal fractions by multiplying the diagonals
33987180	33997740	one times three times the square root is three square roots of nine minus x squared plus four
33999980	34005100	equals six times nine minus x
34009340	34015900	so go back to blue here as we solve square root is going to be annoying so let's square both sides
34015900	34018620	actually blues a bad color let's do green you get a little more contrast
34020620	34026380	square both sides and we know when we square both sides because it's all multiplying we square the
34026380	34035580	pieces three squared is nine squaring the square root gets rid of it so it's nine times nine minus
34035580	34045180	x squared plus four equals six squared is 36 times nine minus x squared
34051500	34057980	let's distribute the nine onto both parts here we'll give us nine times the nine minus x squared
34057980	34065660	plus nine times four is 36 equals 36 times nine minus x squared
34070700	34075820	and if we keep the nine minus x squareds as a group we see we've got 36 of them on the right
34075820	34081980	and nine of them on the left to make life easier let's subtract nine of these nine minus x squareds
34081980	34093100	from both sides that tells us that 36 equals 27 of these nine minus x squareds
34097100	34098860	divide both sides by 27
34103660	34109900	36 over 27 reduces to four thirds equals nine minus x squared
34112300	34121500	get rid of the squared with the square root of both sides and we get two over the square root of
34121500	34133340	three equals nine minus x and i'm going to add x to both sides and subtract oops it's
34133340	34140620	plus or minus two root three sorry that's important if we add x to both sides and add and
34140620	34145900	subtract the two root three from both sides we get an x is equal to nine plus or minus two
34146620	34149260	divided by the square root of three
34152380	34155980	pulling up our calculator to take a look at this we've got nine plus two
34156940	34164700	divided by the square root of three is one answer but what you notice is that gives us 10.15
34164780	34174620	going back to the original the whole distance was only nine if i go 10.15 i'm actually going past
34175900	34181020	my pot of gold and having to go backwards that's not the best strategy to go about
34181980	34183660	so we probably don't want that solution
34186380	34191580	so let's try again and we're going to do nine minus two divided by the square root of three
34192140	34198140	and we find out x the distance we should run is about 7.85
34208540	34214860	so this person's a really good runner he's going to run 7.85 miles before the person
34214860	34219740	jumps into the water and either she or he will swim the rest of the way
34222540	34229740	so now we know she or he's going to run 7.85 miles jump in the water and swim the rest of the
34229740	34239260	way to the pot of gold that'll be the quickest way to get to the pot of gold that's the run and swim
34239260	34252700	problem another classic problem is what i like to call the hallway problem
34258620	34264140	the hallway problem is best illustrated with a picture the idea is you've got a hallway that
34264140	34273740	goes around a corner but the width of the hallway is not the same on both sides maybe on one side
34273740	34280380	the hallway is 10 feet long and on the other side the hallway is 8 feet long
34284380	34289900	and the question becomes how long of a piece of furniture maybe some long picture
34290300	34294540	can you get around that corner
34299100	34302140	in this hallway as you move into the apartment around the corner
34303420	34309260	let's go ahead and write that out what is the longest
34309260	34315660	piece of furniture
34318380	34323660	to fit around the corner
34332220	34335340	well to set this up we need a little bit more information on here
34335580	34343740	one thing we're going to be interested in is what is the angle theta that we're going to be at
34343740	34355100	in order to maximize our distance now we know from geometry if i extend the wall from the top
34355100	34363420	side across this vertical angle across from it's going to have the exact same measurement
34363900	34369020	so we get a triangle to the left and if i drop a line down we have a triangle to the right
34369820	34377180	we actually have two similar triangles but one has a height of eight feet and the other one has a base
34377180	34381020	of 10 feet
34386940	34391260	also we're interested in the pieces of this furniture length
34391260	34398300	so we're going to label the left side x and the top right side y and we know that the total length
34398860	34405900	of my furniture is equal to x plus y but we don't like having two variables so we have to try and
34405900	34409820	use our relationships to reduce it down to one variable
34412620	34416540	and actually that one variable is going to be neither x or y it's going to be theta
34416540	34425420	the angle that connects them both with the 10 foot triangle from the theta we have the adjacent side
34426140	34432620	and the hypotenuse that we're working with that means we're going to use the cosine over there
34432620	34440780	we know that the cosine of theta is 10 over x
34441500	34453100	and with the other theta on the y we've got the opposite side and the hypotenuse
34454540	34460620	that tells us that the sine of theta is equal to 8 over y
34463980	34468700	solving both these equations for x and y we multiply by x and divide by the cosine
34468700	34475900	x is equal to 10 over the cosine of theta and y is equal to 8 over the sine of theta
34477580	34482300	but rather than dealing with the reciprocals of cosine and sine let's just use the reciprocal
34482300	34487500	trig functions and we'll say that x is equal to 10 secant of theta
34489260	34493420	and y is equal to 8 cosecant of theta
34493820	34503580	now we can replace x and y with these pieces and we've been reduced down to one variable
34506540	34512540	the length is equal to 10 secant theta
34512940	34523980	plus the y which is 8 cosecant of theta
34528700	34533820	now we've got our function we're just looking for the spot that maximizes our
34536860	34540940	distance or our size of our furniture where the slope is equal to zero
34541500	34547820	so we'll take the derivative l prime is equal to let's do this in a different color
34547820	34555580	let's go to brown l prime is equal to 10 the derivative of secant is secant tangent
34557500	34567100	secant theta tangent theta plus 8 the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant
34567100	34571660	cotangent so instead of plus 8 let's say minus 8 cosecant
34576460	34577500	cotangent theta
34581660	34586620	and all we need to know is when this equation equals zero
34593260	34596140	well let's start by moving the negative part over to the right side
34596140	34606620	so we've got 10 secant theta tangent theta equals 8 cosecant theta cotangent theta
34611580	34616540	and probably the easiest way to solve this would be to change this all into signs and cosines
34616540	34620620	since we're more familiar with signs and cosines and seeing if we can establish
34621580	34623580	um what's happening here
34625900	34631980	so we'll make a fraction 10s in the numerator secant is 1 over cosine so it's 10 over we've
34631980	34640940	got a cosine theta tangent is sine over cosine so we've got a sine theta over cosine cosine times
34641020	34652460	cosine is cosine squared equals a fraction for the right side 8 cosecant is 1 over sine so that
34652460	34661180	puts a sine theta in the denominator and cotangent is cosine over sine so cosine theta over sine
34661180	34666860	theta we already have a sine theta so now it's sine theta or sine squared theta
34673820	34678780	let's clear out the fractions by doing the cross multiply trick we've done before
34679900	34690860	so we've got 10 sine times sine squared is sine cubed theta equals 8 cosine cubed theta
34691260	34704540	let's move the numbers to one side and the variables to the other side we're more comfortable with
34705180	34710460	tangent which is sine over cosine so let's move the cosines to the right we're gonna
34710460	34714620	or to the left we're going to divide both sides by cosine cubed theta
34715020	34720780	and we'll move the numbers to the right by dividing both sides by 10
34724460	34727260	sine cubed over cosine cubed is tangent cubed
34735580	34739420	the cosine cubes are gone 8 over 10 reduces to four fifths
34739420	34745820	get rid of the cube with the cube root of both sides
34748700	34754940	and then tangent of theta our angle is the cube root of four fifths
34756940	34766380	so theta is equal to the tangent inverse of the cube root of four fifths
34767180	34772460	or to make it easier on our well yeah let's just type that in our calculator
34773660	34776700	let's find out what theta our angle is equal to
34779820	34785740	we want to do the tangent inverse of the cubed root which is conveniently under math
34786300	34790460	option number four is a cube root of four fifths
34790700	34800540	and the tangent inverse of the cube root of four fifths is 0.7482
34802220	34805100	0.7482
34811100	34816620	but if you remember our picture our picture wasn't interested in the angle 0.7482 radians
34816620	34823500	that's what we just found is that angle we're interested in how long is the x and how long
34823500	34832620	is the y which means we have to come back to our x equals and our y equals equations in order to
34832620	34842860	find those pieces so we have x is equal to 10 over the cosine of our angle which is 0.7482
34846700	34852380	and y is equal to eight over the sine of our angle which is 0.7482
34856860	34861340	fortunately our calculator can do that for us quite nicely so we've got 10
34861980	34866140	divided by the cosine of 0.7482
34868540	34872860	and so that x distance is going to be 13.64
34876940	34883580	for our y distance eight divided by the sine of 0.7482
34886140	34889820	that y distance is 11.76
34895740	34901100	so for our final answer the total length of my furniture that can fit around the corner
34901980	34910940	the 13.64 plus 11.76 is going to be 25.4
34913740	34923500	feet i can fit anything that's 25.4 feet long around this corner it's any longer it won't fit
34923500	34929260	i can't take it into my new apartment and that's how we solve the hallway problem
34931340	34934700	so these applied optimization problems can come in many different forms but the
34934700	34939820	philosophy is always the same find out some relationship between the variables take the
34939820	34945580	derivative and set that derivative equal to zero and we can optimize either maximize or minimize
34945580	34952540	depending on the context almost any situation take a look at a few and try a few and we will
34952540	34954140	discuss it more in class
34958860	34965660	another application of the derivative is something that can help us solve limits that before
34965660	34975260	were unsolvable the question we're going to answer is how do we take a limit
34975820	34980540	of an indeterminate
34985740	34986060	form
34991900	34995820	and the way we're going to do that is with what is called
34996380	35010140	L'Hôpital's rule now L'Hôpital was a french mathematician who published this idea in a french
35010140	35015020	calculus text however he's probably not the one who came up with it it was probably one of the
35015020	35020620	Bernoulli mathematicians the Bernoulli's was a was a swiss family that were some of the most
35021500	35027420	amazing mathematicians ever and they all were from the same family and there's some evidence
35027420	35031420	that one of the Bernoulli's were the first to come up with it while L'Hôpital was the first
35031420	35036860	to publish this rule or this trick to take the limit of an indeterminate form
35037900	35042140	but first before we can get into what the rule is let's make sure we understand what the heck is
35042140	35053980	an indeterminate form there's lots of indeterminate forms these are things that are technically
35053980	35062060	undefined but we know that limits often exist at points that are undefined and one of these
35062700	35068220	there's actually two really common ones that we're going to use is when the limit as x goes to some
35068220	35076220	number we'll call it a it could also go to infinity of f of x over g of x where we've got some fraction
35078220	35083180	but when we normally do a fraction with a limit we take the limit of the numerator and the limit of
35083180	35090940	a denominator and simplify what that comes out to but when that reduces to zero divided by zero
35090940	35096780	we say that is an indeterminate form we don't determine anything it doesn't necessarily mean
35096780	35103980	it doesn't exist zero divided by zero is indeterminate so we need to do another strategy in order to solve
35105660	35112300	the second indeterminate form really similar idea is the limit as x goes to a of f of x divided by g
35112300	35120620	of x sometimes will equal infinity over infinity and it could be either positive or negative
35120620	35125420	over a positive or negative infinity but this is also indeterminate because it turns out there
35125420	35130380	are different sizes of infinity and we don't know if we're dividing by the same size or different
35130380	35138620	size is it zero is it infinity is it one it could be lots of different things so if our limit is one
35138620	35147500	of these indeterminate forms lopital suggests the way we solve that using his rule if our limit
35151340	35152700	is an indeterminate form
35156140	35168220	it can be shown that the limit as x goes to a of that fraction f of x over g of x
35169660	35178780	is equal to the same limit as x goes to a but this time of f prime of x over g prime of x
35179500	35187580	and often this second limit is much easier to take in other words if we if we do a division
35187580	35192220	or a fraction with an indeterminate form we'll just take the derivative of the numerator
35192860	35201580	and the derivative of the denominator and calculate that limit so let's do some examples
35202300	35204780	where we do just that
35210540	35217580	first example we're going to take the limit as x goes to zero of sine x over x
35220220	35227340	now normally we plug zero into the numerator and the sine of zero is zero and we plug zero into
35227340	35232460	the denominator and that becomes zero so we're really saying is zero over zero
35234060	35239340	which is an indeterminate form so what we will do is we will take the limit
35239980	35246300	as x goes to zero of the derivatives of the top and bottom the numerator and denominator
35247180	35254060	the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of x is one so we're really saying
35254700	35261260	let's plug zero into the cosine of x so we'd have the cosine of zero
35262620	35267900	over the one is still one and the cosine at zero is one
35270220	35278780	so this limit as x approaches zero is actually approaching one and that's Lopital's rule
35278860	35283660	take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator and take the limit
35286940	35298620	let's try another one let's do the limit as x goes to one of the sine of pi x over the natural log of x
35302620	35307180	well if we plug one into both of these we get one times pi or the sine of pi
35307740	35312940	in the sine of pi the y-coordinate there is zero and the natural log of one
35313740	35321340	means e to the zero power is one so we've got zero over zero we have an indeterminate form
35322140	35327260	because we have the indeterminate form we can take the derivative of the top and bottom and find that
35327260	35336300	same limit the derivative of sine pi x is cosine pi x times the derivative of the inside which is pi
35337900	35344060	over the derivative of the natural log of x is one over x
35349020	35355020	well one over x that is dividing by a fraction it's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal
35355020	35362700	so i'm going to simplify this one step further and flip that fraction over and we have x pi cosine
35363260	35376620	pi x and now if we plug one in we get one times pi times the cosine of pi times one or one pi
35378140	35384460	so we have one times pi cosine of pi the x-coordinate pi is negative one
35385020	35391260	so we have one times pi times negative one which is negative pi
35392780	35395660	our limit as x goes to one is negative pi
35398300	35402060	this even works on problems with infinity that we've seen before let's say
35402620	35406380	remember when we were doing limits at infinity the limit as x goes to infinity
35407340	35410220	of three x squared plus two x minus one
35412860	35416060	over five x squared minus x plus one
35418540	35421900	and if you remember before when we were doing limits with infinity we said okay
35422700	35427420	the x squared is going to take over and so the x squared part gets huge
35427420	35432460	and then we end up dividing out the x squared and we're left with three-fifths
35435820	35442140	but let's solve this using another method using L'Hopital's rule because as x goes to infinity
35442140	35447900	the numerator becomes infinity squared times three plus two times infinity it's going to infinity
35448620	35453340	same thing with the denominator it's going to infinity we have infinity over infinity
35453900	35459420	which means we have an indeterminate form and we can take the derivatives of the numerator
35459420	35466700	and denominator that gives us six x plus two over five x minus one
35470380	35472140	nope ten x minus one sorry
35472300	35482940	but now if we plug infinity in we have six times infinity which goes to infinity
35484860	35489340	and then the denominator we've got 10 times infinity which goes to infinity
35491020	35493660	which means we still have an indeterminate form
35494700	35498700	but there's no reason we can't use L'Hopital's rule twice
35499580	35506300	so again we'll take the derivative the limit as x goes to infinity the derivative of the numerator
35506860	35514220	is six over the derivative of the denominator is ten and that's just a constant
35515020	35523260	doesn't matter what x is approaching it's a constant six tenths which reduces two three fifths
35524140	35533980	we can even use L'Hopital's rule with a one-sided limit let's say the limit as x goes to zero from
35533980	35539900	the right of the natural log of x over the cotangent of x
35543820	35545420	I might need a little bit more room here
35545740	35555100	now as x goes to zero from the right the natural log goes to negative infinity
35556540	35564220	and as cotangent goes to zero cotangent goes to zero remember cotangent is cosine over sine
35565020	35570700	cosine over sine is actually going to be an asymptote that guy's going to infinity
35570700	35578860	we have negative infinity over infinity we have another indeterminate form so we'll take the
35578860	35586140	derivative of the numerator and the denominator the derivative of the natural log is one over x
35588300	35593580	the derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared x
35593580	35598620	and let's actually simplify that
35601900	35609500	it's negative one over x sticks an x in the denominator and cosecant is the reciprocal
35609500	35612540	of sine so let's put the sine squared in the numerator
35615340	35622140	whoops I forgot the limit that's important the limit as x goes to zero from the right of sine
35622140	35627580	squared x negative over x
35631660	35638540	and now if we plug zero in the sine of zero is zero squared is zero
35639260	35644700	and if we plug zero in the denominator now goes to zero so all we've done is we've gone from
35644700	35650620	indeterminate form infinity over infinity to another indeterminate form zero over zero
35650700	35658620	so Lopital says we do it again the limit as x goes to zero from the right of
35660140	35666460	the derivative of negative sine well the negative stays there the derivative of sine squared is two
35667340	35673260	sine x times the derivative of the inside which is cosine x
35673340	35678300	over the derivative of x is one
35682940	35685900	now we can plug zero in and we'll actually get a solution
35687020	35691980	now we have negative two sine of zero cosine of zero
35693900	35698620	which is negative two times the sine of zero is zero the cosine of zero is one
35699180	35704460	and it simplifies down to a limit of zero
35707340	35711340	so this is the big idea of Lopital's rule if we have infinity over infinity
35711340	35716140	or zero over zero we'll take the derivative of both the numerator and denominator
35717020	35721660	so that we can take the limit and plug it in we might have to do it several times
35721660	35724700	but eventually we can get down to a limit
35724940	35732700	those are the indeterminate forms that Lopital's rule allows us to work with
35733660	35738940	but there are still other indeterminate forms
35745980	35752860	that you could end up with the general strategy we're going to imply for these other indeterminate
35752860	35756860	forms is that we need to make them
35759580	35766380	either zero over zero or plus or minus infinity over plus or minus infinity
35767420	35771020	we're going to massage them a little bit to try and make them
35771580	35774380	in two an indeterminate form
35776780	35781420	one classic indeterminate form is zero times infinity form
35782860	35790380	what's nice is the reciprocal of zero is infinity
35791740	35797340	so we're going to move that zero to the denominator and then we'll be in an indeterminate form
35798060	35803420	or the reciprocal of infinity is zero so we could do the reciprocal and move it to the
35803420	35807580	denominator because dividing by a reciprocal is the same as multiplying
35808540	35810300	and we'll end up with a form we can work with
35811260	35817580	here's what this looks like the limit as x goes to zero of x squared of the natural log of x
35821100	35823980	now x squared that's going to zero
35827420	35834380	but the natural log of zero natural log is approaching negative infinity so we've really
35834380	35836460	got zero times negative infinity
35838780	35846220	so we're going to rewrite this problem moving one piece down to the denominator as a reciprocal
35848860	35854860	so let's move the x squared down here so we'll have the limit as x goes to zero
35854860	35860860	of the natural log of x over x to the negative two or the reciprocal
35861740	35867420	x to the negative two would move that exponent up so you can see these are equivalent expressions
35868220	35873420	but now what we have is the natural log of x still approaching negative infinity
35874700	35881100	and x to the negative two or one over x squared is approaching infinity
35891420	35896380	and the reason that's going to zero is we have one divided by a teeny tiny number and we divide
35896380	35902300	by a teeny tiny number we get a huge number as a result so now we have the correct indeterminate
35902300	35909580	form we're ready to use Lopital's rule and we have the limit as x goes to zero of the derivative
35910620	35916220	of the numerator which is one over x over the derivative of the denominator which is negative
35916220	35922860	two x to the negative three cleaning that up a little bit
35925900	35931500	the negative two is going to stay in the denominator so the limit as x goes to zero
35932700	35937020	leave the negative two in the denominator but the x to the negative three moves up
35938140	35940380	and the one over x means it needs to move down
35941100	35951100	and actually that can clean up a little bit we have the limit as x goes to zero of x squared over negative two
35954460	35961660	and now we're ready to plug zero in for the x when we plug zero in for the x we get zero
35961660	35968940	square divided by negative two which is just zero
35972620	35978620	so how we handle that zero times infinity form is we move one piece to the denominator
35978620	35985740	using its reciprocal it's still equivalent that way and then we're in that indeterminate form
35985740	35988060	that we can use Lopital's rule on
35991020	35995500	another indeterminate form is when we have infinity minus infinity
35999340	36003740	if we have infinity minus infinity we need to find a way to combine these
36004300	36012460	to get a single fraction an example of this would be the limit as x goes to zero from the right
36013180	36025180	of one over x squared minus one over sine of x if we were to plug zero in we would have one over
36025180	36032060	zero which is infinity and the sine of zero is zero so we have one over zero which is infinity
36032780	36037980	and so we end up with infinity minus infinity which is not necessarily zero because they might be
36037980	36046060	different sizes of infinity so this is indeterminate form so we need to combine them into a single
36046060	36053500	fraction so that we can try and use Lopital's rule if we do in fact have an indeterminate form
36056380	36060380	common denominator would mean we multiply the first fraction by sine x over x
36061260	36067260	and the second fraction by x squared over x squared and that's going to give us
36068060	36073980	sine x minus x squared whoops forgot the limit part that's important the limit
36075660	36084940	as x approaches zero from the right of sine x minus x squared over x squared times sine x
36085820	36093900	now you'll see if we plug zero into the numerator the sine of zero is zero
36094540	36100940	minus zero squared is zero and in the denominator we multiply zero times zero to get zero
36101740	36108780	we have an indeterminate form which we can use so now we have the limit as x goes to zero from the
36108780	36126620	right of the derivative of sine is cosine x minus 2x over 2x times sine x using our product rule
36128140	36136860	plus x squared times negative cosine x so I'll make it oops sorry not negative cosine x
36139580	36145100	derivative of the sine is positive cosine so we have x squared times cosine x
36146860	36150860	now we have something that we can take the limit as x goes to zero on
36152140	36156540	let's break this down piece by piece so we can really see what's happening when we plug zero into
36156540	36159100	the cosine cosine of zero is one
36161820	36170780	minus so let's just hit equals cosine of zero is one minus two times zero
36173580	36184300	over two times zero sine of zero minus zero squared times the cosine of zero
36184700	36190860	well we still are ending up with zero in the denominator or we're getting closer and closer to zero
36191660	36195740	from the right because we end up with zero minus zero in the denominator
36197100	36201580	but as we get closer and closer to zero from the right what that really means we're doing
36203340	36210700	is we have left in the numerator is one one minus zero divided by something that is almost zero
36210700	36216940	because we're getting closer to zero from the right one divided by almost zero or one divided by
36218060	36226140	something really really small when we divide by tiny tiny tiny tiny things we end up with huge
36226140	36234140	answers and so this limit as x goes to zero from the right is going to be a positive infinity
36234940	36240700	let's try another one
36244620	36248620	another indeterminate form is when we have infinity to the zero power
36250780	36255340	it's not necessarily one might be one but not necessarily
36257580	36263500	for these we're going to use a logarithmic substitution to help us out to solve these problems
36264940	36271100	if we have the limit as x goes to infinity of x to the one over x
36274380	36280860	you'll notice the exponent one over infinity is going to zero and the base infinity
36281900	36290140	is going to infinity we have infinity to the zero power so we're going to rewrite it
36291100	36297420	using logarithmic substitution we're going to let y equal the stuff we're taking the limit of
36297420	36304060	one over the x natural log of both sides moves the exponent out front
36308380	36312700	and we're going to take the limit of what we ended up with
36313180	36323420	and know we can undo that natural log by taking e to whatever power we end up with as our limit or
36323420	36332940	our solution so we're going to take the limit as x goes to infinity of and we're going to write it
36332940	36336300	as a fraction natural log of x over x
36339980	36343100	because we know that natural log as x goes to infinity
36343820	36351500	also goes to infinity and so we now have infinity over infinity we can now use lopital's rule
36352220	36358140	the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x over one
36358860	36366780	which if we clean it up is the limit as x goes to infinity moving that x to the denominator of
36366780	36374460	one over x which we know we're doing one divided by
36377020	36383500	infinity or one divided by a huge number and when we divide by a huge number you're just left with
36384220	36388780	zero but that is the limit
36392620	36399180	of our natural log we have to undo the unnatural log by taking e to that power
36400540	36404220	e to the natural log of y is y so e to the zero
36406620	36410940	and i'll make a note here to undo the natural log
36410940	36417500	that we did the opposite of taking a natural log is e to the exponent
36420940	36427260	we take that a solution we had as our exponent and e to the zero is one
36429740	36437180	so our limit as x goes to infinity of x to the one over x is equal to one
36437500	36442700	let's try another one where we use that strategy again
36443660	36449740	where we take the natural log of y in order to help us solve this one turns out to be in the
36449740	36456220	zero to the zero form which is also indeterminate because a base of zero should have a zero for
36456220	36463020	a solution but an exponent of zero should have one for a solution so what is what is the solution
36463260	36471420	well it depends let's take the limit as x goes to zero from the right of x to the sine of x power
36475100	36479980	again you'll notice if we plug zero into the sine of x the sine of zero is zero
36480860	36485580	and then we have a base of zero so zero to the zero power is indeterminate
36485580	36497740	so we let y equal x sine of x and then we take the natural log of y
36498780	36503740	which moves the exponent out front so we have sine of x times the natural log of x
36509420	36514700	now again we're going to get rid of that natural log by taking e to our exponent
36515820	36525180	so we're going to actually calculate the limit as x goes to zero from the right of sine x
36527820	36529260	times the natural log of x
36532140	36540140	a problem is as sine goes to zero i'm sorry as x goes to zero sine goes to zero
36540940	36543500	and as natural log goes to zero
36546140	36548140	it goes to negative infinity
36550620	36556540	we've got zero times negative infinity we've done this form before this was number one
36556540	36559820	where we said we're going to move a reciprocal down into the denominator
36560780	36563980	let's use that exact same strategy here
36563980	36570140	we could move either one there is one that actually turns out to be easier and better
36570940	36575100	i'm going to come down on the next line to give me some space let's move the sine of x into the
36575100	36581580	denominator so the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the natural log of x
36583500	36588540	over the sine one over the sine of x has to be the reciprocal when we move it down
36589500	36593100	and actually what's nice is we know the reciprocal of the sine function
36594460	36601260	is the cosecant so we're really doing the natural log of x over the cosecant of x
36602540	36607980	which means now we've got the natural log going to as x goes to zero the natural log goes to
36607980	36615100	negative infinity and for the cosecant as x goes to zero cosecant goes to positive infinity
36615100	36620460	we have an indeterminate form that we can finally use lopital's rule on
36622300	36631900	so now we have the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the derivatives one over x over
36631900	36635740	the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent
36635740	36650620	and let's clean that up the limit as x goes to zero from the right the one over x moves the x down
36652460	36657020	cosecant and cotangent are both very familiar reciprocal functions which will move them up
36657020	36664460	which will be very nice cosecant is the reciprocal of sine so negative sine x
36666060	36670060	and cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent
36673740	36681180	so negative sine x over x tangent of x let's keep cleaning this up i want to break this up into
36681180	36690300	two pieces let's break this up into the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the negative sine
36690300	36699500	x over x times the tangent of x because what's interesting there is we know we can use our
36701420	36707260	limit properties to break that up into the product the limit as x goes to zero from the right of
36707260	36717180	negative sine x over x times the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the tangent of x
36718060	36724860	and why would that be better well if you remember at the very start of our discussion
36727660	36734780	we solved the limit as x goes to zero of sine x over x we know that's equal to one
36737020	36741260	so coming down to our problem
36741340	36748060	we have that same limit we just have a negative sign which can come out front
36748700	36755420	so if sine x over x is one negative sine x over x is negative one
36758860	36764940	times plugging zero into tangent x tangent to sine over cosine sine of zero at zero so we have
36764940	36772220	zero over one which is zero which means negative one times zero we've got our limit at zero
36774780	36779180	let's not get too excited because remember we did that natural log substitution
36780220	36783980	so we have to undo that natural log substitution
36784540	36794540	by just taking e raised to our solution our solution was zero e to the zero is one
36795740	36801260	and so we ended up with one for our solution
36804380	36807740	so that's lopital's rule lopital's rule says we can take the derivative
36808380	36813340	of the numerator and denominator if we have an indeterminate form like zero over zero or
36813340	36818700	infinity over infinity at the limit however if it's not in one of those indeterminate forms
36818700	36824780	we're going to have to massage the problem a little bit to put it into a useful indeterminate form
36825740	36830220	we might do that by moving a piece to the denominator we might do that by combining
36830220	36836780	fractions into one or we might do that with logarithmic substitution take a look at these
36836860	36840060	give them a good practice and we will discuss them more in class
36842300	36848620	today we're going to address another question in applied calculus with derivatives and that is
36848620	36860460	how do i find the solution actually it might be better this is a a solution because sometimes
36860460	36868940	there's more than one to f of x equals zero
36875500	36880940	this question is going to give rise to what we call newton's method
36880940	36890540	and this is very similar actually to what your calculator is going to do to find solutions
36890540	36894140	to various equations now we already know
36897420	36906540	that if ax plus b equals zero all we have to do to solve for x is subtract b and divide by a and we
36906540	36917820	get our solution we also know that if it's a quadratic ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero
36918700	36924540	we also know we can solve for x using this simple quadratic equation of the opposite of b
36925100	36930540	plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a
36930860	36939260	and we also actually have a similar formula for cubic functions the cubic's a lot more involved
36939260	36947260	but one certainly does exist but outside of that we don't necessarily have a general solution method
36947260	36955260	to solve for equations that become more complex and more complicated and so what we do is we
36955260	36962940	use newton's method to kind of estimate the solution to any function to get an idea of what
36962940	36965900	we're doing we're first going to look graphically at what's happening
36971900	36976700	graphically what we are doing looks like this
36977500	36987980	say there's some function here that comes down up and around
36990940	36995500	and we want to know what is the zero what is the solution
36997500	37002540	to that function and it's not a real pretty number so we're going to have to estimate it
37003260	37006620	so what we will do then is we will guess as close as we can get
37007340	37010540	and we will call that our first guess we'll use x sub zero
37014460	37020860	and then we'll take that to the line and yes it's pretty close to our zero so to figure out what's
37020860	37025740	happening around there is we will use the tangent line and the tangent line is going to give us our
37025820	37027980	x one which is our next guess
37031820	37039580	and if we go to the line that's closer so what we will do is we will find the tangent line
37042940	37050620	which gets us even closer and we call that x two and then we go to the line and do another tangent
37050620	37058860	line and you see those tangent lines are going to keep getting closer and closer to our actual
37058860	37066140	zero until we can actually estimate its exact point so graphically what we're doing is we're
37066140	37079100	making a guess at x one then we go to f of x one and find the tangent line
37085740	37087660	and then this gives a better guess
37088060	37104540	and then we will call it x two so we find f of x two and find the tangent line
37107500	37116940	and you can see how we begin to repeat the process until we get close enough for our purposes
37118220	37125580	so if that's graphically the process let's look at the equation
37128940	37130300	of the tangent line
37135340	37140700	at x sub zero or our starting guess
37141500	37154380	well we know that y equals f of x naught the y coordinate plus the slope f prime
37155820	37163660	at x naught times x minus the x naught is the equation of the tangent line
37164620	37170780	but then we can find the point
37174380	37180220	x one on this line that hits zero
37182860	37185820	basically what we're saying is zero equals
37186060	37198060	the f of x naught plus f prime of x naught times x one our new guess the new x coordinate
37199180	37208460	minus x naught and then we will solve this equation for the x one
37216780	37221900	as we solve the equation for the x one you'll see that we'll first subtract off the f of x naught
37225340	37228220	then we'll divide out the f prime of x naught
37230620	37236220	and then we'll add the x sub zero which leaves the x sub one
37236460	37243020	all that to say this formula
37245100	37251020	tells us how to find the next point or maybe we can say it more generally x sub n
37251980	37263100	is equal to the previous guess x sub n minus one minus f of the point x sub n minus one
37263820	37267660	divided by the derivative x sub n minus one
37273020	37279100	this is going to be the important equation we're going to use to make it all work
37287820	37288940	let's do an example
37293260	37298700	and we're going to do all the ugly work on our calculator which is going to be really nice
37301180	37312380	so our first example f of x is equal to x cubed minus five x plus two and we want to know when
37312380	37324060	that equals zero to help us we'll do f prime of x the derivative which is three x squared minus five
37326140	37330220	and to get an idea of the shape of the graph let's go ahead and hit y equals
37330220	37340380	and i'm going to graph it we've got what x cubed minus five x plus two and when i graph it
37340380	37345500	you'll see the graph comes up down and back up and we're going to be interested in seeing
37345500	37353020	if we can figure out what is that value just to the right of the origin it looks like it's between
37353020	37358380	zero and one just to the right there what is that value so just kind of sketch a graph
37360460	37368700	the graph comes up down and up and we're trying to find this guy just to the right of the origin
37368700	37373420	that is between zero and one
37376540	37381420	i'm going to give you some calculator instructions that are going to save you a lot of work
37382940	37385740	what you're going to start by doing is we're going to put
37385740	37390060	f of x
37393020	37404700	into y2 the second row and then we're going to put the derivative f prime of x into y3
37404700	37411100	and then in y1
37412860	37417980	we're going to put our formula which is the x minus
37420300	37428700	the y2 equation at x divided by the y3 equation at x
37428700	37437260	into y1 and you'll notice that is exactly the newton's formula that we just found
37437260	37443980	where x is the n minus one y2 is the function y3 is the derivative of the function
37443980	37453980	and the way we grab the function is we type in vars go over to y vars and then we go over to function
37454700	37465020	so let's take a look at what that means y equals clear first i'm going to put f of x
37465020	37479020	into y2 so y2 is x cubed minus five x plus two then i put the derivative into y3
37479900	37491500	three x squared minus five enter and then i'll go up to y1 and for y1 we'll type in x
37492700	37499180	minus we need to grab the y2 equation right next to the arrows is the vars button
37500700	37508620	scroll over to y vars and select function and we want the y2 function which is the second one
37509580	37515580	and then we'll open up a parentheses and say we want to plug the x value into the y2
37517180	37523740	and we're going to divide by the y3 function at x so vars over to y vars
37524700	37530300	function y3 is the third option and we want to plug x into there
37530700	37539340	now when i hit second table let's delete out the points i don't want
37540940	37549900	in x i can put my first guess for the zero we said our zero was between our solution was
37549900	37557660	between zero and one so let's just guess maybe one for our first guess when we put one in for
37557660	37564860	our first guess newton's method says the tangent line is going to take us over to zero so that zero
37564860	37570940	becomes my next guess put zero in for the next guess and newton's method says the tangent line
37570940	37577260	pulls us over to point four that's a little closer so we'll type in point four for our next guess
37577260	37586700	now we've got point four one four one six for our next guess and that gets us a little closer
37587420	37591420	so i'll type in point four one four two one
37593740	37597580	and you notice when i type that and i get the exact same thing for my solution
37597580	37605580	that tells me i'm as close as i can get for my guess
37608060	37611980	so i'm going to come back to my whiteboard here and i'm going to summarize those results from
37611980	37620220	the calculator just to summarize we started with x1 or x0 our first guess was at one
37620460	37624220	that gave us our next guess which was at zero
37626380	37629260	our next guess the calculator gave us was point four
37631020	37635100	our next guess the calculator gave us was point four one four one six
37638060	37643260	our next guess the calculator gave us which was point four one four two one
37643260	37656520	one, and then when we plug that in, we again got 0.41421, and when we get the same thing
37656520	37661800	on it, then we say that our solution is exactly that.
37661800	37683000	x equals 0.4141421 is the solution that exists between zero and one.
37683000	37688560	L'Hopital's rule is really nice though because it even works with non-polynomial functions,
37688560	37694400	and transcendental functions that are a lot harder to work with.
37694400	37701960	So let's try the second example here, where we say the secant of x minus x squared, we
37701960	37707120	want to know when that equals five.
37707120	37714080	Well, Newton's method tells us when things are equal to zero.
37714080	37716120	So what can we do about the five?
37716120	37717120	Exactly.
37717760	37721560	We're going to subtract five from both sides to get the actual function we're going to
37721560	37723520	use Newton's method with.
37723520	37731760	So we have the secant of x minus x squared minus five equals zero, and we also need the
37731760	37742880	derivative, which is secant x tangent x minus 2x, and the derivative of the negative five
37742880	37747080	is zero.
37747080	37751520	So we're ready to go to our calculator.
37751520	37758000	First let's clear out all the old functions.
37758000	37761400	Probably could have kept y1, but it's good to practice typing it in over and over again
37761400	37763960	so you know that formula.
37763960	37768520	But just to get an idea of where it's going, in y2 we're going to type in the function,
37768520	37771520	the original function, which is secant x.
37771520	37779040	Now the calculator can't do secant x, but it can do one divided by the cosine of x, because
37779040	37789600	secant is the reciprocal of cosine, minus x squared minus five.
37789600	37799040	And when I graph this, we end up with this fancy graph, and it's going to curve across
37799040	37803000	the top to come down, and curve across the top to come down.
37803000	37808200	But let's see if we can find the zero just to the right of the axis again.
37808200	37811440	It looks like it's between one and two.
37811440	37815280	So kind of our rough sketch so that we know what we're working with.
37815280	37822520	It came down, wiggled up, and went up, and then it came back down somehow.
37822520	37838080	We're going to be specifically interested in the first one that is between one and two.
37838080	37843680	So in our y equals, y2 is the derivative.
37843680	37856640	The derivative is secant x, which is one over the cosine of x, times the tangent of x, minus
37856640	37861880	2x.
37861880	37869960	Then again in y1 we're going to type in x minus the second function, yvars function
37869960	37878800	2, at our x point, divided by our derivative function, which is in the third function,
37878800	37885880	vars, yvars function 3.
37885880	37892840	Second table, delete out all this other stuff.
37892840	37898160	And we said our first guess was between one and two, so I might try one.
37899120	37903240	You see one shoots us way out to 5.7.
37903240	37905000	That doesn't feel like it's getting closer.
37905000	37911960	In fact if I do 5.7018, that's going to shoot me back to 2.7.
37911960	37919160	So 2.7228 shoots me down to a negative number, so I'm actually on the other side.
37919160	37930080	And if I do negative 0.0015, now we're at 26,000, boy one's not getting me closer.
37930080	37935560	What that means is either I'm not close enough to my point, or the slope at my guess is too
37935560	37940480	steep that it's throwing me way out of whack and I'm not getting anywhere.
37940480	37945120	So we said it's between one and two, let's try two.
37945120	37949880	Two shoots me all the way up to 11, and you can already see kind of the same thing beginning
37949880	37951120	to happen.
37951120	37962640	We type in the next point, which shoots me over to 9.7, 9.7617 shoots me over to 4.6673,
37962640	37982520	shoots me to 4.5696, shoots me over to 4.0024, now I'm back at 1.69, I'm all over the map.
37982520	37986040	So let's try a better strategy.
37986040	37993960	I'm not close enough to the point I want, but we know the point is between one and two.
37993960	38001680	So let's try right in the middle of one and two, 1.5, ah look at that, it keeps me close
38001680	38006600	to 1.5, we're at 1.46, I feel better for that.
38006600	38016240	So let's try 1.4649, and that gives me 1.43.
38016240	38031520	Notice we're staying very close, that's what we want, 1.429, 1.4283, and notice that tangent
38031520	38033640	line is going to be exactly the same.
38033640	38038960	We finally got close enough that we found our zero.
38038960	38043800	I do want to make sure I'm showing my work, so I'm going to list out my guesses.
38043800	38056400	My first guess we started at 1.5, my next guess shot us down to 1.4649, my x2 gave me
38056400	38079080	1.438, x3 gave me 1.429, x4 gave me 1.4283, and x5 gave me 1.4283 again, which was the
38079080	38080760	same.
38080760	38094560	So my solution that's between 1 and 2 is actually at 1.4283, and that is how we do Newton's
38094560	38096680	method.
38096680	38102520	Newton's method just is taking us graphically from a guess to getting closer with the tangent
38102520	38106480	line, then we use the tangent line to get closer, and the tangent line to get closer
38106480	38113240	until we finally find the zero that we're looking for.
38113240	38116840	Worry you have the advantage of using a calculator to make that process easier, but go ahead and
38116840	38121400	practice a few, make sure you're comfortable with it, and we'll take a look at it in class,
38121400	38125080	and we will see you then.
38125080	38131360	One last thing that I want to do before we wrap up derivatives, and begins to take a preview
38131360	38136720	of what is coming in our second quarter of calculus, is looking at what is called the
38136720	38158520	anti-derivative, or really how we answer the question, how do we find derivatives in reverse?
38158520	38171040	And that derivative in reverse is what we call the anti-derivative.
38171040	38192040	And we say that the anti-derivative of f of x, lower case f of x, is the function f of
38192040	38209360	x, but notice it's capital f of x, whose derivative is the lower case f of x. In other words,
38209360	38219280	if capital f of x, the derivative of that is lower case f of x, then the capital f of
38219280	38228000	x is the anti-derivative of the f of x. Maybe it's better with an example. How about we
38228000	38256480	consider f of x equals 3x squared. Now, based on our power rule, which we know, but we're
38256480	38274240	going to do it in reverse, we can conclude that capital f of x, the anti-derivative, must
38274240	38282000	be equal to x cubed, because notice the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared. So the anti-derivative
38282000	38291000	of 3x squared is x cubed. It's the process in reverse. However, there's something we
38291000	38308000	need to note. What if capital f of x equaled not just x cubed, but x cubed minus 1? Or
38308000	38322120	if capital f of x equaled maybe x cubed plus 7? If we took the derivative of both of these,
38322120	38327040	the derivative of the x cubed is the 3x squared we want, and the derivative of the negative
38327040	38333800	one is 0. Similarly, with the other equation, with the plus 7, the derivative of x cubed
38333800	38341160	is 3x squared, and the derivative of the 7 goes to 0. So we actually ended up with three
38341160	38349800	potential anti-derivatives of 3x squared. We've got just x cubed, x cubed minus 1, or x cubed
38349800	38354680	plus 7. And actually, you can see that we could extend that concept to basically say
38354680	38363920	we could add any constant number to the x cubed, and we would still have an anti-derivative.
38363920	38386840	Let's note that. We can add any constant, and we'll call that constant c, to any anti-derivative.
38386840	38392080	That means we're going to have to note that in our final solution. So when we say the
38392080	38407320	anti-derivative, actually let's write this down. Different color. So the anti-derivative
38407320	38421460	of 3x squared is x cubed plus any constant. So let's see if we can kind of use what we
38421460	38435980	know about derivatives and apply those rules in reverse. Let's see if we can do a few examples.
38435980	38448580	Let's say f of x equals 5x to the fourth. Capital f of x, the anti-derivative then.
38448580	38455200	We know that with the power rule, the exponent moves out front and reduces by 1. So we can
38455200	38462660	see the power of 5 moved out front and then it shrunk 1 from 5 down to 4. So capital f
38462660	38472820	of x, the anti-derivative, must be x to the fifth plus any constant. Let's try another
38472820	38486240	one. Let's say f of x is equal to 1 over x. Well we recognize 1 over x as the derivative
38486240	38494260	of one of our special functions. 1 over x is the derivative of the natural log of x.
38494260	38504120	So the anti-derivative must be the natural log of x plus any constant. What about trig?
38504120	38515920	Let's do f of x equals sine of x. What is the anti-derivative? We're really asking whose
38515920	38521680	derivative is the sine of x? Well we know the sine of x is the derivative of cosine
38521680	38527260	of x, but there's that extra negative. The derivative of cosine is negative sine, so
38527260	38534260	we might assume the derivative of negative cosine then must be the positive sine. And
38534260	38547860	of course it's going to be plus any constant. What about f of x equals e to the x? Well
38547880	38553460	this is our favorite function because the derivative is itself and so likewise the anti-derivative
38553460	38564740	will be itself plus any constant. So we've been kind of playing with this idea of an
38564740	38570820	anti-derivative of just kind of thinking the derivative of what should equal this, what
38570820	38575960	do we know about derivatives, what patterns can we notice to kind of come up with the
38575960	38596240	solution. But let's formalize what we're doing here with the formal notation for these anti-derivatives.
38596240	38602120	The formal notation is we'll use this little squiggly sign. That squiggly sign we call
38602120	38613760	the integral. The integral of f of x, and then we'll put a dx so we know the variable
38613760	38619320	we're taking the integral of with respect to x. The integral of f of x dx is going to
38619320	38630320	be equal to that capital F of x plus a constant. That integral sign tells us find the anti-derivative.
38631320	38641040	And just like we have a bunch of derivative rules like the derivative off to the side
38641040	38648580	here, like if we want the derivative of x squared that's equal to 2x. We've got those
38648580	38657160	derivative rules. We also have integral rules as well. And we have one for powers, the power
38657480	38669480	rule. The power rule says the integral of x to any exponent dx is equal to, well let's
38669480	38675880	see if we can piece this together. The derivative makes the exponent shrink by one, so we need
38675880	38682980	the exponent to go up by one. Of course the derivative says the exponent is multiplied
38682980	38690500	out front, so we're going to divide by that new exponent. And with integrals there's
38690500	38701500	always a plus c. This is the power rule, a useful formula to be able to use quite quickly.
38702420	38707300	And just like we use the power rule with derivatives a lot, we're going to use the power rule with
38707300	38717160	integrals a lot. There's actually a whole lot of integral rules. Just to give you a
38717160	38727660	taste here, this table is copied out of your textbook. So, I'll put a number 2 here maybe,
38727780	38748780	c textbook for more integral rules. And this table is in 4.10 and you can see this table,
38749780	38754960	and it kind of takes the differentiation formula which we're familiar with and does it backwards
38754980	38764480	with an integration formula. The second one is the power rule that we just solved. So there's
38764480	38772280	lots of formulas in there, but we're going to focus mainly on the power rule. Let's see
38772280	38790880	if we can find the integral of 7x cubed minus 5x squared plus 2x minus 7 dx. We'll take
38790880	38799380	this one term at a time. With the 7x cubed, we keep the 7, the constant out front, the
38799380	38810380	x cubed goes up to 4, and then we divide by that new exponent. Then we have minus 5x
38810380	38817200	squared, now it goes up because we're doing the antiderivative, goes up to 3, and we divide
38817200	38827140	by that exponent. Plus 2x, we increase the exponent by 1, so now it's squared, and we
38827160	38836160	divide by the exponent. Minus 7, increase the exponent by 1, right now it was x to the
38836160	38841900	zero, that's why it's not there. Increase it by 1, we have x to the first, and we divide
38841900	38849400	by 1. We don't really need to say the divide by 1, but the 2 over 2 does reduce, and so
38849400	38860220	our final integral is 7x to the fourth over 4, minus 5x to the third over 3, plus x squared
38860220	38868320	minus 7x, and don't forget, we always need with integrals and antiderivatives, a plus
38868320	38879320	c. We can use the power rule to even integrate some more interesting looking things.
38879780	38890120	Like for instance, the integral of x cubed minus 2 times the fourth root of x over x
38890120	38901520	squared dx. Now to help us out here, we're going to massage the function a little bit
38901520	38908120	to make it something we can use in our power rule. One thing we can do because of the minus
38908120	38914000	in there is we can distribute the divide by x squared onto both parts, so we actually
38914000	38922680	have the integral of x cubed over x squared minus 2, and let's change that fourth root
38922680	38938320	to an exponent, x to the one fourth over x squared dx. Well we can continue to simplify
38938320	38950320	by subtracting exponents. x cubed over x squared is just x minus 2x to the one fourth
38950320	38957880	minus 2. Well 2 is eight fourths, so one fourth minus eight fourths is negative seven fourths
38957880	38967520	power dx. Moving up to give us a little more room, let's take the derivative now, or the
38967520	38976360	integral, for the x, we raise the exponent by 1 to get x squared, and divide by 2 minus
38976360	38986300	2x, and then we raise the exponent by 1, or four fourths, to get negative three fourths,
38986300	38994880	and divide by the new exponent of negative three fourths. Of course there's going to
38994880	39001160	be a plus c at the end, never forget the plus c. Cleaning up a little bit, we've got a negative
39001680	39008160	that makes it positive. Dividing by a fraction means multiplying by the reciprocal, so let's
39008160	39018480	multiply by four thirds instead. So we have x squared over 2, plus 2 times 4 is 8, negative
39018480	39028520	exponent moves it down, x to the three fourths, plus a constant, and so we have x squared
39028520	39042520	over 2, plus 8x, 8 over 3x to the three fourths, plus our constant. Let's try one more. Let's
39042520	39058260	see if we can do a trig one. The integral of cosine of 3x dx. Now I know the antiderivative
39058260	39064760	of cosine, or what's going to give me cosine when I take the derivative, that's going to
39064760	39076320	be the sine. So I might think maybe sine 3x plus c is my integral, and you'd be very close
39076320	39081880	if you said that. But remember the chain rule says if we take the derivative of sine of
39081880	39089880	x, the derivative of sine of 3x would be cosine of 3x times the derivative of the inside,
39089880	39098680	which would be times three. So we have to undo that times three, and the best way to
39098680	39109440	undo times three is to divide by three. So the integral or antiderivative of cosine 3x
39109440	39119680	is the sine of 3x divided by three, plus a constant. Take a look at some of these in
39119680	39124400	the assignment as you practice a few of these. These antiderivatives or integrals are really
39124400	39130040	about pattern recognition. Trying something out and seeing that's close, how can I adjust
39130040	39136380	to get closer until you get something that is correct? In Calc 2 we'll talk about a lot
39136380	39140480	of strategies to make some of this easier, but for now we want to kind of get some exposure
39140480	39147600	and some experience with integrals and antiderivatives. So take a few of these, and we will see you
39147600	39150120	in class to discuss them further.
