00:00.000 --> 00:09.040
In today's video, we're going to take a look at answering the big question.

00:09.040 --> 00:21.360
What is calculus?

00:21.360 --> 00:36.320
And really, calculus is going to be the answer to three questions.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.200
The first question that we're going to attempt to answer, and we're going to focus on here

00:40.200 --> 00:55.280
in chapter two, is what is it getting close to?

00:55.280 --> 01:02.880
And this in calculus, we're going to affectionately call the limit.

01:02.880 --> 01:06.640
The second question we're going to attempt to answer, and it's really the focus of chapter

01:06.640 --> 01:16.680
three, is what is the slope?

01:16.680 --> 01:20.840
Specifically what is the slope at this given point?

01:20.840 --> 01:30.480
And there we're going to call that in calculus the derivative.

01:30.480 --> 01:42.360
The third question we're going to attempt to answer is what is the area?

01:42.360 --> 01:47.400
And we're not going to really dive into that question until we get to calc two next term,

01:47.400 --> 01:58.200
but for now I'll just tell you that that is the integral of the function.

01:58.200 --> 02:16.640
So to kind of set this up, we're going to take a look at first the tangent problem.

02:16.640 --> 02:39.360
For the tangent problem, I want to first consider how fast these lines are changing.

02:39.360 --> 02:47.000
And we really call that our rate of change.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.440
So I'm going to put three graphs up here.

02:49.440 --> 02:58.600
First graph is going to be y equals two-thirds x minus one.

02:58.600 --> 03:08.120
And this graph, I'll have a y intercept at negative one, and it'll rise two and run three

03:08.120 --> 03:09.120
to another point.

03:09.120 --> 03:13.880
So it's going to look something like that.

03:13.880 --> 03:28.040
The second graph we're going to look at is y equals negative three x plus two.

03:28.040 --> 03:35.960
And so that graph has a y intercept at two, and it slopes down three over one, and it

03:35.960 --> 03:38.440
looks like this guy.

03:38.440 --> 03:47.640
And the third graph we're going to look at is y equals negative one.

03:47.640 --> 03:53.320
And that's just a flat line right at negative one.

03:53.320 --> 03:57.840
And the question here that we're considering is how fast are these lines changing?

03:57.840 --> 03:59.600
How are these lines changing?

03:59.600 --> 04:05.280
The first graph here, the two-thirds x minus one, we see it is going uphill from left to

04:05.280 --> 04:09.720
right, but it's going uphill slowly.

04:09.720 --> 04:18.160
It's kind of gradually working its way uphill, which is different than the second graph because

04:18.160 --> 04:23.040
not only is it going downhill, but it's also going down much quicker.

04:23.040 --> 04:31.280
It's going downhill quickly.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.720
And that's going to be different than this third graph, which really isn't going up or

04:35.720 --> 04:36.720
down.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.040
It's kind of flat lined.

04:39.040 --> 04:49.640
So we'll say this is a flat or no change.

04:49.640 --> 04:54.200
Now what's interesting here is these lines are really easy to see how the graph is changing

04:54.200 --> 04:55.520
because they're just a straight line.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.240
They're always changing at the same rate.

04:57.360 --> 05:02.400
A is always going up slowly, B is always going down quickly, and C is always flat without

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
any change.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.600
But this is not always the case.

05:07.480 --> 05:31.640
Actually, most functions do not have a constant rate of change.

05:31.640 --> 05:51.720
For example, if we consider the graph, y equals x squared plus two.

05:51.720 --> 05:58.240
Now y equals x squared plus two has a vertex rate at two, it's got the point at one three

05:58.240 --> 06:10.840
and negative one three and then six and negative six, or I'm sorry, three six and three negative

06:10.840 --> 06:14.840
three six.

06:14.840 --> 06:22.560
So here is the graph of x squared plus two.

06:22.560 --> 06:32.480
Now if we consider at the point zero where x is equal to zero, if I were to look at

06:32.480 --> 06:36.680
that graph, it's kind of leveled out there at the bottom, we could draw a line that's

06:36.680 --> 06:41.520
tangent to that point, and right now it has a slope of zero.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.320
It's really not changing at that point.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.400
It's not going up or down, it's kind of leveled out at the bottom.

06:47.400 --> 06:53.040
It's a little different than if I consider the point that's just one to the right, because

06:53.040 --> 06:58.640
at that point it's actually got a much steeper tangent line that could be drawn that barely

06:58.640 --> 07:01.240
attaches it.

07:01.240 --> 07:06.440
And there, the slope of that graph, it's going uphill, it's actually rising two and running

07:06.440 --> 07:07.440
one.

07:07.440 --> 07:14.040
If I could grab a different color, we could look at this point at negative one, or negative

07:14.040 --> 07:15.440
two.

07:15.440 --> 07:21.600
Looking at the point at negative two, we see it's very, very, very steep.

07:21.600 --> 07:28.240
In fact, the slope there is going to be negative four, and we'll talk later about how we can

07:28.240 --> 07:30.720
actually calculate those exact slopes.

07:30.720 --> 07:35.800
But what's interesting here is this graph starts out with a very steep negative slope,

07:35.800 --> 07:42.080
and then it levels out and turns into a positive slope, which gets steeper and steeper.

07:42.080 --> 08:01.600
I've already hinted at this, but the lines that touch the graph

08:01.600 --> 08:13.120
are what we're going to call tangent lines, where they touch the graph in one point and

08:13.120 --> 08:19.920
then go off into the distance.

08:19.920 --> 08:26.960
So the question we're going to attempt to find out is, what is the slope of these tangent

08:26.960 --> 08:30.620
lines?

08:30.620 --> 08:35.060
To do that, we're going to set up another thing called the secant line.

08:35.060 --> 08:51.580
We can actually approximate the rate of change

08:51.580 --> 09:15.180
for a tangent line with what we're going to call a secant line.

09:15.180 --> 09:20.540
Here's what we mean by that.

09:20.540 --> 09:27.500
So we've got some graph here, we're going to say it comes in, goes up, and levels off,

09:27.500 --> 09:34.900
and right here we're going to say is A, means if we go up, this point here is going to be

09:34.900 --> 09:43.740
at F of A, and then a little bit over from A is B, and if we go up from B, that point

09:43.740 --> 09:59.300
right there will be at F of B. If we connect A and B with a line, that is called a secant

09:59.300 --> 10:00.300
line.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.500
A secant line is going to go through two points on the line.

10:03.500 --> 10:09.260
In fact, we know what those two points are, let's go ahead and label those in brown.

10:09.260 --> 10:15.500
The x-coordinate of this first point is A, and the y-coordinate is F of A, and the second

10:15.500 --> 10:25.140
one with B, the x-coordinate is B, and the y-coordinate is F of B. If we wanted to calculate

10:25.140 --> 10:32.740
the slope, which we always use M for slope, of the secant line, we know it's y2 minus

10:32.740 --> 10:35.260
y1 over x2 minus x1.

10:35.260 --> 10:48.940
That would be F of B minus F of A over the B minus the A. This is going to be an important

10:48.940 --> 10:56.420
formula for us, the formula for the slope of the secant line.

10:56.420 --> 11:11.220
What's interesting about this is as A and B get closer and closer together, let's draw

11:11.220 --> 11:32.500
another graph, as A and B get close, let's see if I can draw that same graph on here approximately,

11:32.500 --> 11:42.300
and if we keep A at about the same spot, and so F of A is still at the same spot, but if

11:42.300 --> 11:52.100
we put B right next to it, notice it's closer now for F of B, the secant line that connects

11:52.100 --> 11:58.500
them is starting to look like a tangent line that only touches in one spot.

11:58.500 --> 12:15.460
In other words, as A and B get closer together, we get closer to the tangent line.

12:15.460 --> 12:20.540
This is the big idea that we're going to go after today, is can we get A and B close enough

12:20.540 --> 12:32.900
together so that we can estimate what is the tangent line.

12:32.900 --> 12:38.020
Let's try it though with some numbers in there to make things a little clearer.

12:38.020 --> 12:52.620
So let's do number four, we're going to do an example here, we're going to estimate

12:52.620 --> 13:13.300
the slope and equation, while we're at it, of the tangent line to the function F of x

13:13.300 --> 13:25.220
equals two x squared minus three at the point two comma five.

13:25.220 --> 13:35.260
Now the idea here is we want to estimate what it is using a different x and y point

13:35.260 --> 13:42.060
where we're going to try and get closer and closer and closer to our actual point of two.

13:42.060 --> 13:46.980
So we know at two the y coordinates five, so we'll start kind of close to two, maybe

13:46.980 --> 13:52.980
we'll start at two point one, then we'll get a little closer, two point oh one, then we'll

13:52.980 --> 13:58.420
get a little closer, two point oh oh one, and then finally a little bit closer, two point

13:58.420 --> 14:03.660
oh oh one, and we're going to see what y equals at each of these points.

14:03.660 --> 14:08.940
We know at two it's going to hit five, but what's it going to hit as we get close to

14:08.940 --> 14:14.020
two, as we pull B closer and closer to our A. Fortunately this is going to be really

14:14.020 --> 14:23.500
easy to do on our calculators, so if we turn our calculators on and hit the y equals button,

14:23.500 --> 14:34.700
we can type in our function in y equals, and our function is two x squared minus three.

14:34.700 --> 14:39.260
Then what we're going to do is if we hit the second button, and then right above graph

14:39.260 --> 14:48.540
we see in blue it says table, and we should be able to delete these values out of here.

14:48.540 --> 14:53.740
If you cannot delete the values out of your table, first hit second and then above window

14:53.740 --> 15:00.020
you see it says table set, and we're going to change the independent variable the x to

15:00.020 --> 15:05.620
ask, so that we can pick what we want that x to be equal to.

15:05.620 --> 15:11.140
Now go back to second table, and now we can enter in our values we want for x. The first

15:11.140 --> 15:18.780
value we want is two point one, the second value is two point oh one, the third value

15:18.780 --> 15:29.540
is two point oh one, and the third value is two point oh oh one.

15:29.540 --> 15:35.500
And we start to see we get these values for y. Let's record them in our y column here.

15:35.500 --> 15:43.020
That's five point eighty two, the next one was five point oh eight oh two, the next one

15:43.020 --> 15:56.260
was five point oh oh eight, and then finally it was five point oh oh eight.

15:56.260 --> 16:02.420
So now what we really end up with is a third column, let me label it in black here, x comma

16:02.420 --> 16:06.860
y is going to be our third column, these are going to be our points that we're going to

16:06.860 --> 16:09.660
be compared to the original point of two five.

16:09.660 --> 16:16.500
So x comma y is two point one comma five point eighty two, then we had two point oh one comma

16:16.500 --> 16:25.100
five point oh eight oh two, then we had two point oh oh one comma five point oh oh eight,

16:25.100 --> 16:34.820
and then finally two point oh oh oh one comma five point oh oh oh eight.

16:34.820 --> 16:41.580
We're going to use these points and the original point, the two comma five, to calculate a

16:41.580 --> 16:48.500
whole bunch of slopes of the secant line, and again we're going to use the calculator

16:48.500 --> 16:53.220
to help us out with that to make some of these calculations easier.

16:53.220 --> 16:58.420
If we hit second quit, it'll take us back to the home screen, quit is right above the

16:58.420 --> 17:04.580
mode button, and then we're just going to type in our slope formula where the numerator

17:04.580 --> 17:07.340
and denominator need to be in parentheses.

17:07.340 --> 17:13.700
So the y two we calculated from the first point was five point eighty two minus the

17:13.700 --> 17:22.100
y one was five, because we always go back to the original point, divided by the x one

17:22.100 --> 17:28.180
from the point we found, the two point one, whoops need to put it in parentheses, two

17:28.180 --> 17:35.100
point one minus the two, close the parentheses, and when we hit enter we find our slope right

17:35.100 --> 17:38.220
now is eight point two.

17:38.220 --> 17:45.080
So let's go ahead and record that, our slope right now is eight point two, but then we're

17:45.080 --> 17:48.460
going to move a little bit closer.

17:48.460 --> 17:52.180
Now we're going to use our second point, which is the two point oh one comma five point

17:52.180 --> 18:01.340
oh eight oh two, again y two minus y one, so five point oh eight oh two minus the y from

18:01.340 --> 18:09.780
our original point of five, divided by the two point oh one minus the two, again remember

18:09.780 --> 18:22.160
numerator and denominator in parentheses, and now we have a slope of eight point oh two.

18:22.160 --> 18:30.620
Let's try our third point, our third point was five point oh eight minus the five, divided

18:30.620 --> 18:39.720
by the two point oh one minus the two, and now we're going to get this nice pretty eight,

18:39.720 --> 18:42.960
our slope right now is eight.

18:42.960 --> 18:46.080
In fact when we do it again for the third point we're going to get the exact same thing

18:46.080 --> 18:52.300
because we are so close, the difference is going to be minuscule, five point oh oh eight

18:52.300 --> 19:02.500
minus the five, divided by the two point oh oh one minus the two, and again we get eight

19:02.500 --> 19:08.920
for the slope.

19:08.920 --> 19:17.700
So we can use this fact to estimate the slope of the tangent line now.

19:17.700 --> 19:22.500
We see the slope of the secant line is getting closer and closer to eight point oh, so the

19:22.500 --> 19:27.740
slope of the tangent line is probably that eight point oh that we're getting closer and

19:27.740 --> 19:31.060
closer to.

19:31.060 --> 19:38.960
So if it is eight point oh then we're ready to actually calculate the equation at that

19:38.960 --> 19:43.880
point, and going back to our algebra days a good equation to remember that the equation

19:43.880 --> 19:53.720
of the line is equal to y equals m times x minus x one plus y one, where x one and y

19:53.720 --> 20:03.340
one are a point we know that's on the line, and m is the slope.

20:03.340 --> 20:08.580
This is a good equation to commit to memory because we are going to use this equation

20:08.580 --> 20:13.660
a lot in this course.

20:13.660 --> 20:18.220
So for our purposes we've got y equals m, the slope of the tangent line we just found

20:18.220 --> 20:24.440
out was eight times x minus x one, going back to our original point the x coordinate was

20:24.440 --> 20:29.400
two plus the y coordinate of five.

20:29.400 --> 20:36.080
The equation of our tangent line two x squared minus three at two five is this guy y equals

20:36.080 --> 20:45.080
eight times x minus two plus five.

20:45.080 --> 20:53.060
We can use this concept in physics to look at what's called the average velocity and

20:53.060 --> 20:56.820
the instantaneous velocity.

20:56.820 --> 21:02.700
Velocity is really talking about speed, so if we're talking about the average velocity

21:02.700 --> 21:15.880
or the average speed, speed doesn't really have direction and velocity does have direction,

21:15.880 --> 21:17.040
it's only real different.

21:17.040 --> 21:38.940
The average velocity of an object can be found by the velocity average is equal to the function

21:38.940 --> 21:46.340
at the first point at the initial point of time minus the function at the final point

21:46.340 --> 21:51.680
in time, all over the difference in the times.

21:51.680 --> 21:56.040
And really you'll notice that this equation, while I mark it as an important equation that

21:56.040 --> 22:05.720
we need to know for our course, it really is the same equation as the secant that we've

22:05.720 --> 22:07.400
already worked with.

22:07.400 --> 22:12.760
And then if that's the average velocity over an amount of time, we can find the instantaneous

22:12.760 --> 22:25.260
velocity

22:25.260 --> 22:29.740
or how fast the object is moving at a specific point in time instead of an average over a

22:29.740 --> 22:50.480
range, it is found by making T2 closer to T1.

22:50.480 --> 22:54.480
In other words, the same idea we did before, if we try closer and closer and closer numbers,

22:54.480 --> 22:58.800
we'll get closer and closer to the actual instantaneous velocity, which is the slope

22:58.800 --> 23:01.260
of a tangent line.

23:01.260 --> 23:11.020
So let's try an example problem where we can see that actually done.

23:11.020 --> 23:35.800
Let's see, an object is dropped from the top of a 144 foot cliff

23:35.800 --> 23:51.100
and it will land three seconds later.

23:51.100 --> 23:54.880
We can actually find the function for its height.

23:54.880 --> 24:10.200
Its height is given by the function f of x equals negative, actually let's not do f

24:10.200 --> 24:14.560
of x, let's make it more descriptive, we're doing height, so let's say height of T or

24:14.560 --> 24:26.240
height of time is equal to negative 16 T squared plus 144.

24:26.240 --> 24:52.480
We're going to find the average velocity between 2 seconds and 2.01 seconds and between 1.99

24:52.480 --> 24:54.600
seconds and 2 seconds.

24:54.600 --> 24:59.960
So the average velocity just after 2 seconds and the average velocity just before 2 seconds

24:59.960 --> 25:04.120
and see what we can learn about that.

25:04.120 --> 25:10.280
So first for the first point, I'll do this first point in blue, the average velocity,

25:10.280 --> 25:13.560
we need to know what the height is at those two points.

25:13.560 --> 25:22.280
So we'll say h of 2 and I'm just going to plug this into our calculator.

25:22.280 --> 25:34.520
Negative 16 times 2 squared plus 144, when I do that on the calculator we get 80.

25:34.520 --> 25:43.120
So the height of 2 is 80 and the height just afterwards at 2.01, again if I plug that into

25:43.120 --> 26:04.080
my calculator, negative 16 times 2.01 squared plus 144, that's going to equal 79.3584, 79.35,

26:04.080 --> 26:07.240
let's just round it to 8.

26:07.240 --> 26:13.400
So the average velocity then is going to be the slope between these two points.

26:13.400 --> 26:26.320
So the average velocity is equal to y2, which is 80, minus y1, 79.358 over the difference

26:26.320 --> 26:30.640
in the x's, 2 minus 2.01.

26:30.640 --> 26:43.680
The average velocity here is negative 64.2 feet per second.

26:43.680 --> 26:49.720
So just after 2 seconds the object is moving at 64.2 feet per second, it's negative because

26:49.720 --> 26:51.120
it's going down.

26:51.120 --> 26:55.080
Let's see what's happening just before, we'll do this in green off to the right here so

26:55.080 --> 26:56.600
we can keep these separate.

26:56.600 --> 27:03.120
So we need to know what the height is at 1.99 and what the height is at 2, fortunately we

27:03.120 --> 27:07.440
already calculated the height at 2, that's 80.

27:07.440 --> 27:15.280
If we put the 1.99 in our calculator we'll end up with approximately 80.638, so to find

27:15.280 --> 27:22.920
the average velocity here we'll subtract the y's divided by subtracting the x's.

27:22.920 --> 27:34.680
So 80.638 minus 80 divided by 1.99 minus 2, and when we do this we find out the average

27:34.680 --> 27:45.560
velocity just before 2 seconds is negative 63.8 feet per second.

27:45.560 --> 27:52.000
And what you'll notice is both of these are really close, 0.2 away of each side of the

27:52.040 --> 28:14.640
negative 64, so we can actually find out or estimate the instantaneous velocity

28:14.640 --> 28:20.920
to be somewhere in the middle of these two guys, so between 64.2 and 63.8 it's probably

28:20.920 --> 28:27.440
at 2 seconds at that exact moment in time moving approximately negative 64 feet per

28:27.440 --> 28:37.560
second, that would be the tangent line or the instantaneous velocity.

28:37.560 --> 28:41.280
So with this preview so far we've answered really the first two questions, we've been

28:41.280 --> 28:47.360
looking at what is the slope or the tangent and then also what is that secant line getting

28:47.360 --> 28:52.800
close to, let's take a look at a little preview of the third question of calculus, we won't

28:52.800 --> 28:56.240
spend much time on this because it's really a second quarter calculus question, but the

28:56.240 --> 29:10.960
question is what is the area, here's what that looks like in calculus.

29:10.960 --> 29:20.480
And back to part C addressing the area problem.

29:20.480 --> 29:35.680
We are going to consider, actually let's make this number one, consider the area under y

29:35.680 --> 29:51.400
equals x minus three squared plus one between the x values of zero to three.

29:51.400 --> 29:56.480
We're going to need a really tall graph for this, that shouldn't be too bad, we've got

29:56.480 --> 30:08.800
plenty of space here, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

30:08.800 --> 30:13.200
So we know x squared is the parabola shape, the minus three moves it to the right three,

30:13.200 --> 30:26.760
the plus one moves it up one.

30:26.760 --> 30:37.480
So the graph is going to look something like this, and it wants the area between zero and

30:37.480 --> 30:45.800
three, so between zero and three what we're really doing is saying what is the area that

30:45.800 --> 30:58.680
fills in underneath the graph, what we want is the area shaded in green here, is how much

30:58.680 --> 31:03.800
area is underneath the graph.

31:03.800 --> 31:11.480
So we can estimate it, and the way we're going to estimate it is we're going to say, hey,

31:11.480 --> 31:14.480
it's really easy to find the area of a rectangle.

31:14.480 --> 31:27.360
So we can use rectangles where the right corner of the rectangle actually touches the graph

31:27.360 --> 31:28.880
that we're talking about.

31:29.880 --> 31:31.880
So let me see if I can recreate the graph here.

31:42.880 --> 31:47.880
So it hits at nine, three, one.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.880
Is that right?

31:54.880 --> 32:06.880
It hits at ten.

32:06.880 --> 32:12.160
So here's our graph, roughly drawn, and what we're going to do is we're going to take each

32:12.160 --> 32:22.680
point and make it into a rectangle where the right corner of the rectangle touches the graph.

32:22.680 --> 32:31.160
So each rectangle is one wide, and the first rectangle is one high, the second rectangle

32:31.160 --> 32:39.680
you see is too high, and the third rectangle, I think it's five high?

32:39.680 --> 32:43.160
Yeah, it's five high.

32:43.160 --> 32:54.520
So we could say that the area under here is five plus two plus one, or the area is approximately

32:54.520 --> 33:04.720
eight when we use rectangles on the right side, where the right corner hits the graph.

33:04.720 --> 33:08.440
But we could also do it the other way because the problem here is we end up a little bit

33:08.440 --> 33:11.640
short.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.440
Let's use just some gray space for the short.

33:14.440 --> 33:19.760
Notice we miss this gray triangle, and another gray triangle, and another gray triangle.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.880
We're short because we went to the right.

33:22.880 --> 33:36.880
So to avoid being short, we could draw rectangles that the left corner touches the graph.

33:36.880 --> 33:38.640
And see how that compares.

33:38.640 --> 33:44.240
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, and one, two, three, four,

33:44.240 --> 33:45.240
five.

33:45.240 --> 33:52.920
Putting our key points on here of three, one, move over one and up one, over one and up one,

33:52.920 --> 34:04.440
two, three, and then finally the nine.

34:04.440 --> 34:09.800
So if I wanted to draw rectangles where the left corner touched the graph, we would start

34:09.800 --> 34:16.320
at the top point and say, okay, come out from the left corner, and there is my first rectangle.

34:16.320 --> 34:21.600
Then come out from the left corner, go over one unit, and there's your next.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.520
And come out from the left, and there's our next rectangle.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.600
And so we end up with three rectangles again.

34:28.600 --> 34:32.080
And we can find the area of those rectangles.

34:32.080 --> 34:36.280
The first rectangle on the left has a height of ten.

34:36.280 --> 34:48.480
Actually, let's put, whoops, let's put, ah, wrong color.

34:48.480 --> 34:53.480
Let's put the heights on the right here.

34:53.480 --> 34:57.880
The height of ten, the second rectangle is a height of one, two, three, four, five, and

34:57.880 --> 35:02.200
the third rectangle has a height of two.

35:02.200 --> 35:09.160
So when we add those together, the area that we end up with is going to be ten plus five

35:09.160 --> 35:10.760
plus two.

35:10.760 --> 35:17.640
The area comes out to be approximately seventeen.

35:17.640 --> 35:20.380
But again, we've got a problem.

35:20.380 --> 35:24.120
Because now instead of having too little area, we end up with too much area.

35:24.120 --> 35:28.760
We've kind of got this area that I'm going to color in in gray that sticks up above the

35:28.760 --> 35:31.160
graph.

35:31.160 --> 35:36.040
So the first time we were too low, the second time we're too high.

35:36.040 --> 35:42.920
How are we going to estimate what the actual value is?

35:42.920 --> 35:52.000
Well, we could estimate, since we're just estimating, the actual area is in the middle

35:52.000 --> 35:56.480
of these two values.

35:56.480 --> 36:02.720
So we could just average the eight and seventeen, eight plus seventeen divided by two.

36:02.720 --> 36:08.520
When we do that, we get a twelve point five.

36:08.520 --> 36:15.760
So we're going to say our final estimate is that the area underneath y equals x minus

36:15.760 --> 36:17.960
three squared plus one between zero and three.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.040
We're going to estimate that it's about twelve point five.

36:21.040 --> 36:33.600
Well, as you might expect, this process is not perfect because actually the actual area

36:33.600 --> 36:35.880
is twelve exactly.

36:35.880 --> 36:39.400
So we've got an extra point five out of it, but that's not a bad estimate for just kind

36:39.400 --> 36:43.840
of drawing rectangles and estimating and making a guess at it.

36:43.840 --> 36:49.200
Now in calc two, we'll talk about some methods to find that exact area of twelve, but for

36:49.200 --> 36:54.200
now I just want to kind of expose you, this whole lesson today is just a preview of calculus.

36:54.200 --> 37:01.140
Just expose you to the idea of the three questions that we're going to be addressing in calculus.

37:01.140 --> 37:02.800
What is it getting close to?

37:02.800 --> 37:04.040
We call that a limit.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.640
We're going to focus on that in chapter two.

37:06.640 --> 37:07.980
What is the slope?

37:07.980 --> 37:12.240
We call that the derivative and we'll focus on finding that in chapter three.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.040
And then finally, what is the area?

37:14.040 --> 37:19.040
We call that the integral and we're going to find that in calc two.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.560
So I hope you enjoyed this preview of calculus.

37:21.560 --> 37:25.440
Take a look at the practice problems in the book and I'll look forward to seeing you in

37:25.440 --> 37:28.480
class.

37:28.480 --> 37:34.360
As we dive into our study of calculus, we need to answer the first foundational question

37:34.360 --> 37:41.600
of what is a limit?

37:41.600 --> 37:46.080
So we're going to answer that question kind of broadly today and then a little bit later

37:46.080 --> 37:48.600
we'll answer it more precisely.

37:48.600 --> 38:05.880
So we're going to kind of say the intuitive definition of a limit.

38:05.880 --> 38:15.360
So the general idea that we're going for when we say a limit, we're saying what value,

38:15.360 --> 38:35.520
what should be there, even if it is not there?

38:35.520 --> 38:40.520
What should be in the function, even if it's not actually in the function at that point?

38:40.520 --> 38:52.760
And symbolically how we'll represent that is we will say that the limit as x approaches

38:52.760 --> 39:02.040
some number of f of x equals l or the limit.

39:02.040 --> 39:10.960
So again, mathematically or in words what those symbols up above there mean is that

39:10.960 --> 39:31.080
as x gets closer to a, the f of x gets closer to l.

39:31.080 --> 39:37.360
So we're trying to figure out what is the function approaching?

39:37.360 --> 39:49.080
What is it getting closer to as our x gets closer to some value of a?

39:49.080 --> 39:53.240
So there's two main ways that we're going to do this.

39:53.240 --> 40:05.000
The first way that we can find a limit is what we're going to call the table method,

40:05.000 --> 40:09.760
where we basically take that definition that says as x gets closer to a, well let's try

40:09.760 --> 40:12.120
and get closer to a.

40:12.120 --> 40:25.640
We're going to try values closer and closer to a or to that number that x is supposed to

40:25.640 --> 40:27.280
get close to.

40:27.280 --> 40:38.240
So what I mean by that is we are going to find the limit as x approaches two of x squared

40:38.240 --> 40:43.600
minus four over x minus two.

40:43.600 --> 40:49.920
Now if I were to just try and find what two actually equals in this function, you'll notice

40:49.920 --> 40:51.920
it's going to end up being undefined.

40:51.920 --> 40:55.160
There's actually nothing at two.

40:55.160 --> 40:58.680
But we're not interested in what's actually happening at two.

40:58.680 --> 41:05.240
We're interested in what should be at two, even if it's not at two.

41:05.240 --> 41:09.800
So to set this up, we're going to make a table where we're going to take various values of

41:09.800 --> 41:15.720
x that are going to get closer and closer to two, and we're going to see how that compares

41:15.720 --> 41:19.400
to f of x or our function.

41:19.400 --> 41:25.120
So we'll start maybe at 1.9, that's a little shy of two, and then we'll get closer, 1.99.

41:25.120 --> 41:31.920
And then a little closer, 1.999, and even closer, 1.9999, we're going to get really

41:31.920 --> 41:36.080
close to two and see what happens to f.

41:36.080 --> 41:40.160
Now an important part of a limit is it has to work on both sides.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.840
So we can't just do values a little bit smaller than two.

41:43.840 --> 41:50.360
We need to pick values for x and calculate f of x that are a little bit bigger than two.

41:50.360 --> 41:57.560
So we might start with 2.1, go a little bit closer, 2.01, a little bit closer, 2.001,

41:57.560 --> 42:02.840
and a little bit closer, 2.001.

42:02.840 --> 42:07.600
Now fortunately our calculators' table settings are going to make these calculations quite

42:07.600 --> 42:09.440
nice for us.

42:09.440 --> 42:15.520
So if we turn on our calculator and go into the y equals function, I can hit clear to

42:15.520 --> 42:18.440
delete anything that might be in there already.

42:18.440 --> 42:22.800
And the function we're working with is x squared minus four over x minus two.

42:22.800 --> 42:27.160
Now to preserve the order of operations, I need to put in parentheses the numerator

42:27.160 --> 42:28.280
and denominator.

42:28.280 --> 42:38.120
So x squared minus four, close the parentheses, divided by, open up parentheses, x minus two,

42:38.120 --> 42:41.080
and close the parentheses.

42:41.080 --> 42:47.280
And now we'll go to our table by hitting second table, and there's values in here from a previous

42:47.280 --> 42:52.200
problem we don't need, so I'm going to delete those all out.

42:52.200 --> 43:02.720
Our x's here, go start at 1.9, enter, then we've got 1.99, oops, too many nines, enter,

43:02.720 --> 43:21.080
then three nines, 1.999, and then finally 1.999, four nines.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.280
There we go.

43:23.280 --> 43:27.960
And what we see is we get 3.9, 3.99, 3.999, so let's record these.

43:27.960 --> 43:36.800
So first we start with 3.9, then f of x becomes 3.99, then it became 3.999, then it became

43:36.800 --> 43:39.800
3.999.

43:39.800 --> 43:44.960
You can kind of see that's getting closer and closer to a very clear number, but to

43:44.960 --> 43:47.680
check it we have to go on the other side.

43:47.680 --> 43:55.080
So let's delete out what's in the table here, and let's check these other values.

43:55.080 --> 44:08.920
The 2.1, the 2.01, the 2.001, oops, too many zeros again, and then the 2.0001.

44:08.920 --> 44:12.280
And we kind of see the same pattern here, it won't always be a clear pattern like this,

44:12.280 --> 44:21.480
but this one's kind of nice, so we can record our f of x became 4.1, 4.01, 4.001, and then

44:21.480 --> 44:26.720
finally 4.0001.

44:26.720 --> 44:32.240
And what we see is from the left side these numbers are getting closer to four, growing

44:32.240 --> 44:34.000
and growing and growing to four.

44:34.000 --> 44:38.200
From the right side these values are also getting closer and closer, shrinking and shrinking

44:38.200 --> 44:41.560
down to four as we shrink and shrink down to two.

44:41.560 --> 44:50.880
And so what we can say then is that the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus four

44:50.880 --> 44:57.240
over x minus two seems to be from this table equal to four.

44:57.240 --> 45:02.040
Now this doesn't mean that x squared minus four over x minus two is equal to four when

45:02.040 --> 45:04.600
x is two, because it's undefined at that point.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.040
There's nothing there.

45:06.040 --> 45:10.180
The limit is just what should be there even if it's not.

45:10.180 --> 45:13.240
So we'd say four probably should be in there, but it's not.

45:13.240 --> 45:18.680
As we get really close to two we're getting really close to four.

45:18.680 --> 45:25.360
Let's try another example.

45:25.360 --> 45:31.640
The table method's really nice when it works, but it doesn't always work as beautifully as

45:31.640 --> 45:33.120
we would hope.

45:33.120 --> 45:44.200
We're going to find the limit as x approaches zero of the cosine of one over x.

45:44.200 --> 45:48.480
And again, just like before, we're going to take some values for x that are a little

45:48.480 --> 45:49.480
bit smaller.

45:49.480 --> 45:50.960
It's a little bit smaller than zero.

45:50.960 --> 45:56.560
Might be negative point one, negative point oh one, negative point oh oh one, negative

45:56.560 --> 46:02.360
point oh oh oh one, and we're going to find what f of x equals.

46:02.360 --> 46:07.080
And then we'll try some values for x that are just to the right of zero.

46:07.080 --> 46:13.800
Point one, point oh one, point oh oh one, and point oh oh oh one.

46:13.800 --> 46:19.760
Getting closer and closer to zero from each side.

46:19.760 --> 46:22.880
Again we're going to have our calculator do the dirty work for us, but we need to change

46:22.880 --> 46:26.480
the function so we'll clear out the old function.

46:26.480 --> 46:35.160
Starting with our function is cosine of one over x, close the parentheses.

46:35.160 --> 46:39.920
Now something to check if I hit the mode button, which is right next to second, I should see

46:39.920 --> 46:42.200
that radians is highlighted.

46:42.200 --> 46:47.620
We will always be in radians in this course, so make sure the radians is highlighted.

46:47.620 --> 46:52.680
So we've got the cosine of one over x, and then when we go to our table, hit second table,

46:52.680 --> 46:56.200
I've got to delete out the old values.

46:56.200 --> 47:06.160
And for the first column we've got negative point one, negative point oh one, then we've

47:06.160 --> 47:14.440
got negative point oh oh one, whoops got an extra zero, negative point oh oh one, and

47:14.440 --> 47:20.840
finally negative point oh oh oh one.

47:20.840 --> 47:25.080
And this guy seems quite all over the board.

47:25.080 --> 47:31.320
What you see is f of x begins by equaling negative point eight three nine one, then it was positive

47:31.320 --> 47:38.940
point eight six two three, then it was positive point five six two three eight, then it was

47:38.940 --> 47:47.840
negative again at point nine five two two.

47:47.840 --> 47:52.400
Let's try, delete these out, let's try the other side, see what patterns we see on the

47:52.400 --> 47:53.600
other side.

47:53.600 --> 48:05.440
Point one, point oh one, point oh oh one, and point oh oh oh one.

48:05.440 --> 48:11.860
We get actually the exact same numbers with the exact same randomness, f of x seems to

48:11.860 --> 48:21.540
be negative point eight three nine one, point eight six two three two, and then point five

48:21.540 --> 48:30.020
six two three eight, and then finally negative point nine five two two.

48:30.020 --> 48:35.460
Now in the first example, coming from the left we started approaching a number, and coming

48:35.460 --> 48:40.660
from the right we started approaching a number, but this time we don't seem to be doing that,

48:40.660 --> 48:56.900
we are not approaching any one value, which actually if we were to graph this function

48:56.900 --> 49:04.300
using a graphing calculator or maybe a great website is Desmos where you can graph it,

49:04.300 --> 49:08.580
this graph kind of goes up and down and then it starts to become really crazy as it gets

49:08.580 --> 49:12.460
next to zero and then it just becomes really crazy.

49:12.460 --> 49:20.140
So it's really hard to see what's happening because it's going crazy, it's not approaching

49:20.140 --> 49:27.940
any one value, so in this case when our table method fails we say the limit as x equals

49:27.940 --> 49:40.140
zero, actually let's do this in red, we will say the limit as x equals zero or x approaches

49:40.140 --> 49:47.300
zero of cosine of one over x equals d and e which is going to be an abbreviation for

49:47.300 --> 49:58.780
does not exist because it's not approaching any one value, it's kind of going all over

49:58.780 --> 50:06.580
the place, we're going to say this limit does not exist.

50:06.580 --> 50:11.740
So our first strategy for finding the limit is what's called the table method, we take

50:11.740 --> 50:20.140
values that are closer and closer to the number we want and see what the function is getting

50:20.140 --> 50:24.500
closer and closer to on both the left and right side.

50:24.500 --> 50:29.500
The second method is what's called the graph method where we can actually look at the

50:29.500 --> 50:50.060
graph and see what y value is the graph approaching.

50:50.060 --> 51:14.700
So let's draw a graph here that we can play with and let's see we're going to put a vertical

51:14.700 --> 51:25.740
asymptote here at two, I'm going to put a point at negative one comma three, I'm going to put

51:25.740 --> 51:31.820
a whole at one comma two but I'm also going to put a point at one comma negative one,

51:31.820 --> 51:42.420
I'm also going to put a point at two comma one and then an open point at two comma negative

51:42.420 --> 51:50.780
one, I'm going to bring the graph down from that two comma negative one starting at the

51:50.780 --> 52:04.260
asymptote, I'm going to come up from the asymptote and then kind of go through my points.

52:04.260 --> 52:09.700
So we got this funky looking graph, a lot of weird things happening but that's okay.

52:09.700 --> 52:13.780
The first question we're going to attempt to answer is to see if we can find the limit

52:13.780 --> 52:19.980
as x approaches negative one of this function.

52:19.980 --> 52:27.540
So as x approaches negative one what we see is the graph is really approaching a y value

52:27.540 --> 52:29.780
of three.

52:29.780 --> 52:38.820
So we will say the limit as x approaches negative one on this graph is three.

52:38.820 --> 52:46.500
What's the limit as x approaches positive one of this graph?

52:46.500 --> 52:52.460
Now it's interesting to note that positive one, this graph clearly is equal to negative

52:52.460 --> 52:54.740
one because that's where the solid dot is.

52:54.740 --> 53:01.660
There is an open dot on the graph which means there's a hole that's not actually there but

53:01.660 --> 53:06.700
with limits we're interested in what actually should be there even if it's missing and you

53:06.700 --> 53:12.900
see the graph coming in from both the left and the right are really getting close to

53:12.900 --> 53:16.840
a height of two.

53:16.840 --> 53:22.100
And so we'll say this graph is getting closer and closer to two as we get closer and closer

53:22.100 --> 53:24.420
to one.

53:24.420 --> 53:29.540
Even though if I were to ask what f of one is, f of one is actually equal to negative

53:29.540 --> 53:33.540
one but it doesn't matter what the point actually is.

53:33.540 --> 53:41.540
What matters is what is the point getting closer and closer to?

53:41.540 --> 53:42.540
One more.

53:42.540 --> 53:48.580
Let's take the limit as x approaches two of f of x.

53:48.580 --> 53:52.740
Now at two this is interesting because at two from the left side, let me see if I can

53:52.740 --> 54:03.420
get rid of some of this red, it's kind of getting in the way.

54:03.420 --> 54:09.020
At two we see from the left side the graph is getting close to one but when we come in

54:09.020 --> 54:15.420
from the right side it seems the graph is getting closer and closer to negative one.

54:15.420 --> 54:20.620
Since those are not the same values, it's not approaching the same value from both sides,

54:20.620 --> 54:25.420
we have to say that this limit does not exist because we're not approaching one value.

54:25.420 --> 54:30.580
We can't say there's one value that should be there because it's really approaching two

54:30.580 --> 54:34.100
different values.

54:34.100 --> 54:38.900
Which kind of sets up the idea that if we're approaching one value on the left and one value

54:38.900 --> 54:45.300
on the right, why don't we call those two different limits?

54:45.300 --> 54:55.700
And that sets up this idea of what we're going to call a one-sided limit.

54:55.700 --> 55:03.420
Where we have this notation of the limit as x approaches some number a and we'll put a

55:03.420 --> 55:10.500
little negative sign like a superscript of f of x and when we see that negative sign,

55:10.500 --> 55:19.900
that negative sign means I'm only interested in coming from the left side, coming from

55:19.900 --> 55:28.700
where all the negatives are on the left side of the graph versus if I want the limit as

55:28.700 --> 55:36.940
x approaches a with a little positive subscript, that positive superscript means I only want

55:36.940 --> 55:46.220
to come from the right side.

55:46.220 --> 56:08.580
So for example, if I have a graph like this, let's say it comes down kind of like x squared

56:08.580 --> 56:14.060
up until we have a gap at one, an empty hole at one, and it's going to drop down to negative

56:14.060 --> 56:25.220
two and become a straight line from there.

56:25.220 --> 56:29.300
So now I can ask, what is the limit as x approaches one?

56:29.300 --> 56:35.140
Even though it approaches two different values at one, if I put a little negative superscript,

56:35.140 --> 56:39.780
that means I'm only interested in coming in from the left side.

56:39.780 --> 56:48.220
And so when I come in from the left side, we see it's approaching positive one, which

56:48.220 --> 56:53.060
is different than if I ask for the limit as x approaches one from the right side of the

56:53.060 --> 56:55.460
function.

56:55.460 --> 57:01.220
Coming in from the right side of the function, it's going down here to a y value of negative

57:01.220 --> 57:05.660
two.

57:05.660 --> 57:11.620
So now we can calculate the limits if we specify if we're coming from the left or the right

57:11.620 --> 57:14.340
side.

57:14.340 --> 57:19.980
Notice however, we still cannot say the limit as x approaches one because these are not

57:19.980 --> 57:21.620
approaching the same value.

57:21.620 --> 57:27.660
From one side it's one, from the other side it's negative two, it does not exist.

57:27.660 --> 57:45.780
In fact it only exists if the left and right are the same.

57:45.780 --> 57:49.380
Now if they happen to both be the same, that's great, then it exists.

57:49.380 --> 57:55.460
But if they're not the same, then it's not going to work.

57:55.460 --> 57:59.940
Let's look at the idea of one-sided limits, not with the graph method, but with the table

57:59.940 --> 58:05.500
method that we did at the beginning of this lecture.

58:05.500 --> 58:12.280
Number two, let's make what's called a piecewise function.

58:12.280 --> 58:20.340
If f of x is equal to, and it's got two parts, it's equal to x minus two if x is less than

58:20.340 --> 58:29.540
one, and it's equal to x squared plus one if x is greater than or equal to one.

58:29.540 --> 58:33.660
So just like before it's got one part on the left and one part on the right, we use one

58:33.660 --> 58:41.440
equation for small values of x, we use another equation for bigger values of x.

58:41.440 --> 58:52.160
So we're going to use a table to find three things.

58:52.160 --> 59:01.280
The limit as x goes to one from the left of f of x, the limit as x goes to one from the

59:01.280 --> 59:10.400
right of f of x, and then we're going to use that to decide if the limit as x goes to one

59:10.400 --> 59:19.120
of f of x actually exists, and if it exists, what is that number?

59:19.120 --> 59:25.800
So let's start with the table on the left side.

59:25.800 --> 59:30.440
We're going to look at values of x from the left of one, which means we want to be a little

59:30.440 --> 59:39.760
bit less than one, so maybe 0.9, getting closer 0.99, getting closer 0.99, and then even closer

59:39.760 --> 59:49.840
0.9999 to see what the f of x equals.

59:49.840 --> 59:55.120
So on our calculator we'll hit y equals, clear out the old equation.

59:55.120 --> 01:00:02.200
When we're on the left, we're smaller than one, so smaller than one is going to be x

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:08.480
minus two, because x is smaller than one, and we'll hit second table to weed out the

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.680
old values, because they aren't doing us any good.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:29.360
The new values are 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, and 0.499.

01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:36.400
And what we see is essentially what we're ending up with is negative 1.1, negative 1.01, negative

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:47.040
1.001, and ultimately pretty much negative one when we round it off.

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:56.080
So what that tells me then is that the limit as x approaches one from the left, using numbers

01:00:56.080 --> 01:01:06.360
slightly smaller of f of x, we're approaching or getting closer to negative one.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:11.760
Now let's look at the right side.

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:20.480
Using x values to the right, slightly higher than one, we might start with 1.1, 1.01, 1.001,

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:28.840
and 1.001, and we're going to see what happens to f of x.

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.820
The key here now is I have to go to y equals and delete out my old function, or clear out

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:39.420
my old function, because now that x is bigger than one, we have to use the other equation,

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:45.220
the second equation, which is x squared plus one.

01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:57.540
And when we hit second table and clear out the old values, our new values are 1.1, 1.01,

01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:12.260
and 1.001, and we see a definite pattern emerging as we fill in our f of x column.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:25.540
That was 2.21, 2.0201, 2.002, and 2.0002, but we see those are definitely approaching

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:34.060
a clear number, so we can announce that the limit as x approaches one from the right of

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:43.540
f of x using slightly bigger numbers, we're getting closer and closer to two.

01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:50.140
So what does it all mean about the limit as x approaches one of f of x overall?

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:54.140
Well because the left and right are approaching different numbers, one's approaching negative

01:02:54.140 --> 01:03:02.460
one and one's approaching positive two, these are not the same, so the limit does not exist

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:09.700
purely at one.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:14.980
Now there is another case that I want to look at of what can happen as you're trying to

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:32.300
make your table, like we're up to E now, what I'm going to call infinite limits.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:48.420
For example, if I take the limit as x approaches three, we'll go from the left this time of

01:03:48.420 --> 01:03:56.900
one over x minus three, didn't need to be in parentheses, but it will be in parentheses

01:03:56.900 --> 01:04:01.420
for our calculator anyways, so we're going to look at values for x and see how our f

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.420
of x compares.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:07.540
I set only on the left, so we need a little bit smaller than three, we'll start at two

01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:13.580
point nine, then we'll try two point nine nine, two point nine nine, and two point nine

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:20.540
nine nine to get us really, really close.

01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:27.300
Hit y equals, clear out the function one divided by in parentheses, so we don't lose our order

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:37.060
of operations, x minus three, close the parentheses, and then we'll head to our table, second table,

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:44.500
clear out these numbers because we're interested in two point nine, two point nine nine, two

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:55.340
point nine nine nine, and two point nine nine nine nine, and there's a clear pattern here,

01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:08.900
we go from negative ten to negative a hundred to negative one thousand to negative ten thousand,

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:14.020
so when we're trying to calculate the limit as x goes to three from the left of one over

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:18.660
x minus three, we see it's not necessarily approaching any one number, but it's definitely

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:23.060
going somewhere specifically, it's getting bigger and bigger, or more and more negative

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:27.780
would be a better way to say it, so what I'm going to say is this is actually going to

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:32.780
negative infinity, because as I get closer and closer to three, I'm going to get a more

01:05:32.780 --> 01:05:40.220
and more negative number, in fact a similar thing happens if we go to the other side of

01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:45.700
the function, let's take the limit as x goes to three from the right of one over x minus

01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:54.100
three, and look at various values for x and how f of x compares, from the right we need

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.980
to be slightly bigger than three, so we'll start at three point one, get a little closer,

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:08.140
three point oh one, closer three point oh oh one, and closer three point oh oh oh one,

01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:14.660
and let's see how this compares on our calculator, same function so I don't have to type it in

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:23.620
again, but for my x values we're going from three point one to three point oh one to three

01:06:23.620 --> 01:06:32.660
point oh oh one, whoops got an extra zero, three point oh oh one, and then finally three

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:41.100
point oh oh oh one, and we see the exact same pattern starting to happen here, we've got

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:49.700
ten, one hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand, the only difference is now the graph is not

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:56.440
negative instead it's positive, so the limit as x goes to three from the right of one over

01:06:56.440 --> 01:07:03.620
x minus three, it's getting bigger and bigger and positive so we will say it's going to

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:13.100
be positive infinity, so our limits can actually be infinite, positive or negative infinity

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:19.060
if it truly is getting bigger and bigger or negative bigger and bigger without bound,

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:34.900
and what this actually means about the graph, this means the graph has a vertical asymptote

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:54.200
at three, or x equals three would be a better way to say it, in other words if I were to

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:58.740
sketch a graph of this guy really quick and I'll just make a small version of it one,

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:05.860
two, three, at three there's going to be a vertical asymptote and the graph is going

01:08:05.860 --> 01:08:12.100
to bend around that vertical asymptote, and so you see when we're approaching from the

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:16.420
left it's going down to negative infinity and when we're approaching three from the

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:30.540
right it goes to positive infinity, before we wrap up here let's do one more problem

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:39.780
where we just find a bunch of limits just to practice, so I'm going to draw a graph

01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:59.020
on here, we're going to go four each direction, and at negative three comma three we're going

01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:09.260
to put a point and from that point it's going to curve up to the left, we're also at negative

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:18.780
three two going to put an open point, then at negative one comma four we're going to put

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:26.860
an open point, and then at two we're going to put a vertical asymptote, so we're going

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:35.020
to connect the open point to open point is the maximum and then come down to the asymptote,

01:09:35.020 --> 01:09:42.660
and then at three comma two we'll put another point and kind of bring the graph down and

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:51.340
into that point, I want to put one more point on this graph at negative one comma one, we

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:58.460
have that open dot at negative one, the closed point means where the point actually is, might

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:03.740
not be where it's supposed to be but that's where it actually is, so I've got nine of

01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:11.140
these, I want to see if we can calculate, first we're going to find the limit as x approaches

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:22.860
negative one of f of x, now at negative one what is the graph getting close to, not where

01:10:22.860 --> 01:10:27.540
the graph is actually, you'll see from the left and the right the graph is getting closer

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:37.340
and closer to a height of four, so we say the limit at negative one is four because that's

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:46.900
what should be there even if it's not, notice that's different than asking what is f at

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:52.940
negative one, where is f actually at negative one, and at negative one on the curve there's

01:10:52.940 --> 01:11:02.860
a hole at negative one, the actual negative one point is at a height of one, how about

01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:18.180
this one, the limit as x approaches negative three from the left of f of x, well at negative

01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:27.900
three from the left we see this graph is approaching a height of three, we can compare that with

01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:36.020
the limit as x approaches negative three from the right of f of x, when we come from the

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:43.820
right or the positive side notice it comes down a bit lower to a height of two, so the

01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:56.380
limit there is approaching two, which means if I asked what the limit as x approaches

01:11:56.380 --> 01:12:03.260
negative three of f of x is, we can see already from the left and the right we're approaching

01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:10.140
two different values, they're not the same, because they're not the same this limit does

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:25.620
not exist, it must be the same to exist, how about the limit as x approaches two from

01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:35.580
the left of f of x, as we get closer from the left side to two notice this graph is

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:43.100
going down to a vertical asymptote, because we're going down all the way this is actually

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:48.940
equal to negative infinity, it goes down all the way to infinity before it actually gets

01:12:48.940 --> 01:12:59.780
to two because it will never touch that vertical asymptote, similarly the limit as x approaches

01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:08.220
two from the right of f of x, looking at the right side we see the graph is going up, up

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:22.580
and up and up without bound or stopping, it's going to be equal to positive infinity, what's

01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:34.980
the limit as x approaches three of f of x, now three is right where this point is on the

01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:39.700
right side and notice when we come in from the left or the right it's going to that same

01:13:39.700 --> 01:13:46.700
height of two, so we'll say the limit is approaching two and what you might also notice is the

01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:54.820
point that should be there actually is there, so we can also say that f of three is also

01:13:54.820 --> 01:14:01.860
equal to two, and so when the limit and the point are equal to each other that's significant

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:07.900
to us, we say that means the graph is continuous at that point because the limit and the point

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:12.500
are the same, but we're going to spend a whole day on continuity a little bit later, right

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:17.580
now what's important is that you get very comfortable finding limits both from the graph

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:24.260
method and also from the table method, so take a look at some of the assignments in the book

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:33.140
and I look forward to seeing you in class so that we can discuss these limits in more detail.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:48.820
Today we're going to take a look at the question, how can we evaluate limits?

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:52.980
In our last lesson we looked at how we can use a table or a graph to evaluate a limit

01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:57.700
by getting closer and closer to a specific value, what we're going to do today is take

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:06.340
a look at some limit laws that we can use to help us find limits quicker and more accurately.

01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:17.620
First there are two basic limit laws.

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:27.100
The first is that the limit as x approaches a of x, since x is a straight line with no

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:32.500
holds or gaps or any funny actions happening on the graph, we can say that that limit is

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:39.380
going to equal whatever number we're checking on the graph.

01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:47.460
The second limit is as x approaches a of some constant where c is just any number but there's

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:56.420
no x's in there, then that is going to always approach that constant or c.

01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:02.060
These two are our basic limit laws and important that we should be very comfortable calculating

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:06.500
those limits as soon as we see them.

01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:13.980
So for example if I ask what is the limit as x goes to negative four of x, we should

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:20.300
know right away that's going to equal the number or the negative four.

01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:27.300
Similarly if I want to know what the limit is as x approaches seven of two, two is just

01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:29.780
a number or a constant.

01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:35.540
This function is always equal to two regardless of what x is, so even at seven x is still

01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:40.420
or the function is still equal to two.

01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:48.340
In addition to the basic limit laws, there are six other properties of limits or limit

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:57.300
laws that we should be comfortable working with.

01:16:57.300 --> 01:17:01.380
We'll list all six here and then we'll look at some examples of how these limit laws can

01:17:01.380 --> 01:17:03.860
be worked out.

01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:11.900
First is the sum or difference as they both work the same.

01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:17.460
And the idea here is if we take the limit as x approaches some number a of two parts

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:25.380
that are added together, maybe f of x plus g of x, that is actually the same as if we

01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:32.100
took the limits of the two parts individually, the limit as x approaches a of the f of x,

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:37.780
and added the limit as x approaches a of g of x.

01:17:37.780 --> 01:17:43.620
If we take the two parts individually, we'll get the same result and it works for subtraction

01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:49.980
also, so I'm going to change this to plus or minus.

01:17:49.980 --> 01:18:00.020
The next limit law is what we call the constant multiplier, where we're going to take the

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:10.780
limit as x approaches a of some constant times something with x in it.

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:15.860
The way we can work here is that constant actually is multiplied by whatever the limit

01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:25.540
as x approaches a of that function actually is.

01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:36.740
We also have the product rule, which says if I want the limit as x approaches a of f

01:18:36.740 --> 01:18:45.180
of x times g of x, two things multiplied together, we can actually take the limits of the two

01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:53.060
parts, the limit as x approaches a of the first part, times the limit as x approaches

01:18:53.060 --> 01:18:59.500
a of the second part, or the g of x.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:07.500
Same idea works for a quotient, because really multiplication and division are just inverse

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:17.500
reciprocals of each other, so limit as x approaches a of f of x divided by g of x, that is equal

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:34.580
to the limit as x approaches a of f of x divided by the limit as x approaches a of g of x.

01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:38.140
We also have what's called the power rule.

01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:48.780
The power rule says if I'm interested in finding a limit as x approaches a of some function

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:56.260
that is raised to some type of exponent, we can find the limit first and then raise the

01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:11.300
answer to some exponent, and because exponents and radicals are really the same thing, we

01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:20.280
can extend this to number six, what we call the radical rule, which is that the limit

01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:28.680
as x approaches a of the square root of some function is equal to the square root of the

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:40.400
limit, so I'm going to highlight all six of these limit laws as important limit laws that

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:47.400
we know and understand, but this is a case, as is often the case with calculus, is it's

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:53.880
more important that we understand how to use the six rules than it is that we can actually

01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:59.520
quote the six rules from memory, because if we understand the process of what we're doing,

01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:04.360
we just have to straight out solve the problems instead of going through memorizing a whole

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.840
bunch of formulas, which should not be the goal in any calculus class.

01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:15.600
Basically what we're saying here is that we can take the limits of the pieces we can,

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:19.760
and we can add and subtract them, we've got constant multipliers, limit pieces can be

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:26.080
multiplied, divided, exponents, radicals, we can just take the limits of the individual

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.600
pieces.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:39.400
Maybe it's easier to explain with some examples.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:52.200
If we want the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus three x plus four.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:57.260
We know from our limit laws that this added and subtracted can be broken into three pieces.

01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:02.120
We also know that the exponents and constants can be pulled outside of the limit, so what

01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:11.280
this really means we can do is we can take the limit as x approaches two of the x and

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:27.200
then square it minus three times the limit as x approaches two of the x and add four.

01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:35.920
We add the limit as x approaches two of the four.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:43.320
We have the two basic limit laws that says the limit of x is the number and that the

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:46.760
limit of a constant is equal to the constant.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:56.160
If we plug that in, the limit as x approaches two of x becomes two squared minus three times

01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:02.120
the limit as x approaches two of x is just two plus four.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:11.640
I can plug this into my calculator and we'll end up with two.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:14.960
Let's try another one.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:23.720
The limit as x approaches negative one of the square root of x plus five.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:30.320
Limits go through exponents, radicals, pluses, minuses, fractions, so what we really can

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:40.320
say is this is the square root of the limit as x goes to negative one of x plus the limit

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:48.120
as x goes to negative one of five.

01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:53.280
We know the limit of x is the number, the limit of a constant is the constant.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:01.720
This is the square root of negative one plus five, which is the square root of four or

01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:09.480
also two.

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:13.040
What you might notice here is instead of doing all the work of putting that limit through

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:19.400
all the pieces, what we're really doing is whenever possible, we're taking the number

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:25.720
we're working with and plugging it in to the x.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:43.160
In summary, what we're really doing is what's called direct substitution.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:50.920
In other words, if I had an example like the limit as x approaches one of x squared minus

01:24:50.920 --> 01:25:00.680
four over x squared plus two x plus one, what that really means is we can put the one in

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:04.080
for the x to see what's happening around one.

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:13.440
If I put the one in, we get one squared minus four over one squared plus two times one plus

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:15.900
one.

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:22.560
One minus four is negative three and one plus two plus one is four and so the limit as x

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:28.240
approaches one is negative three-fourths.

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:35.560
In summary, the easiest way we can calculate a limit is to directly plug that number into

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.080
the function.

01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:41.920
However, that doesn't always work perfectly.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:48.560
We've got a couple techniques to handle what we do if direct substitution doesn't quite

01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.560
work.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:26:08.640
First let's call this additional techniques that we will use when substitution does not

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:16.520
work.

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:26.600
First we're going to find the limit as x approaches negative three of x squared plus four x plus

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:38.040
three over two x squared plus five x minus three.

01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:44.600
What I want to notice is when we plug negative three in, especially interested in the denominator,

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:54.280
we get two times nine minus fifteen minus three which is zero.

01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:10.280
What we're noticing is substitution divides by zero.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.600
We can't divide by zero.

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.640
We can't have zero in the denominator.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.920
We need an additional technique.

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:32.480
Our additional technique is going to be to factor and reduce.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.080
Hopefully when we do this, we'll be able to actually take the limit through direct substitution.

01:27:38.080 --> 01:27:42.400
We're going to take the limit as x goes to negative three.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.160
The numerator factors nicely.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:45.920
X squared is x times x.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:50.320
Three is three times one.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:55.280
Both positive gives us four x in the middle.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:59.440
In the denominator, two x squared is two x times x.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.680
Three is three times one.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.040
Is that the right order?

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.520
Six and one.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.880
If we do plus six and a minus one, it will work.

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:17.080
What's really nice there is now you see that x plus three reduces out.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:29.680
We're left with the limit as x goes to negative three of x plus one over two x minus one.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:35.480
Now direct substitution works great because no longer does our denominator equal zero.

01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:37.360
We're no longer dividing by zero.

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:45.160
Instead, we have negative three plus one over two times negative three minus one, which

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:54.040
is negative two over negative seven, and a negative divided by a negative is a positive.

01:28:54.040 --> 01:29:02.320
For our final answer, this limit equals two sevenths.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:07.920
Our first technique, if we're dividing by zero, we can factor and hopefully reduce

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:13.160
out the part that equals zero.

01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.400
Here's a second problem.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:26.600
The limit as x goes to eight of the square root of x plus one minus three over x minus

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.160
eight.

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.600
Again, we have the same note.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:42.400
If we substitute in the denominator, eight minus eight will be zero.

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:55.800
Substitution divides by zero.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.040
We can't do that.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:30:00.080
We need another trick.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.520
This time we can't factor because there's a radical in there.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:09.560
However, there's a trick that we use with radicals.

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:19.520
If radicals are getting inconvenient, we'll get rid of the radicals by multiplying by

01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:24.360
the conjugate.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:28.320
This is similar to what we did in pre-calculus and algebra.

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:32.360
When we were rationalizing the denominator, we multiplied by the conjugate.

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:37.000
This time we're going to rationalize the numerator and see if that helps us.

01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:40.360
We'll change the sign in the middle.

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.360
Everything else is the same.

01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:45.320
The square root of x plus one and three is the same, but instead of subtracting, we're

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:52.360
going to add the numerator and the denominator.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:58.200
When we do that, the numerator becomes nice, limit as x goes to eight still.

01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:02.720
Because these are conjugates, a sum and a difference, the first part is squared.

01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:08.720
When we square a square root, we just get the inside stuff, x plus one.

01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:15.760
Then it's always a minus, and then we square the last part, three squared is nine.

01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:18.720
Over, let's keep the denominator factored.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:27.400
X minus eight times the square root of x plus one plus three.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:34.680
That's nice because in the numerator, we can simplify and notice one minus nine is x minus

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:40.320
eight.

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.080
We still have the same denominator.

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:47.280
Don't need to multiply that out because we want to stay factored so we can divide out

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.800
that x minus eight.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:56.200
Remember if everything divides out, there's still a one up there that doesn't disappear.

01:31:56.200 --> 01:32:06.640
Now we're taking the limit as x goes to eight of one over the square root of x plus one

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:11.560
plus three.

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:20.360
Now we can plug our number in because the denominator no longer will equal zero.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:27.160
We have one over the square root, plugging eight in, eight plus one plus three equals

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:32.720
one over the square root of nine is three plus three is sixth.

01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:43.560
We now know our limit is one sixth.

01:32:43.560 --> 01:32:58.000
Another example, let's find the limit as x approaches three of one over x plus two minus

01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:06.960
one over five all over x minus three.

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:12.560
Again we have the same notes, the same problem.

01:33:12.560 --> 01:33:20.080
Substitution means we're dividing by zero, we can't divide by zero.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:27.960
However we've dealt with complex fractions, fractions and fractions before.

01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:43.760
We multiply top and bottom by the least common denominator which in this case is a five and

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.760
an x plus two.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:52.440
So we'll multiply by five x plus two and just distribute it through five x plus two and

01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:59.600
the denominator also by five x plus two.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:05.680
When we do that the x plus twos and the fives divide out, be careful with the negative,

01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.920
it's going to have to distribute through the parentheses, don't get in trouble with that

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:10.920
negative.

01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:16.600
Get us some more whiteboard space.

01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:24.840
So now we have the limit as x goes to three of five minus x minus two distributing the

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:37.400
negative all the way through all over x minus three times five times x plus two.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:46.400
Line up by combining like terms in the numerator, the limit as x goes to three of three minus

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:57.520
x over x minus three times five times x plus two.

01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:02.320
We've got our subtraction backwards with the three minus x and the x minus three but that's

01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:06.520
okay because if we remember from pre-calc those can reduce out if there's a negative

01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:13.440
one left behind, the negative one swaps the order of the subtraction.

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:24.400
So now we have the limit as x goes to three of negative one over five times x plus two.

01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:30.520
Now we can do direct substitution because no longer are we dividing by zero.

01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:39.400
So negative one over five times three plus two which is negative one over five times five

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.880
or twenty-five.

01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:46.000
So there's three tricks here and these three tricks are going to come back again when we're

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.720
talking about derivatives so it's good to take a moment to go over what we just did.

01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:57.400
The first trick we did is we can find a limit by factoring and reducing.

01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:04.520
We also can get rid of radicals by multiplying by conjugates and we also can get rid of complex

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:09.760
fractions by multiplying top and bottom by the LCD.

01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:16.520
Three tricks that are going to be very useful to us so that we can use that direct substitution

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:24.640
in order to find a limit.

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:28.660
So we're talking about finding limits though, I want to go back to the discussion we had

01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:35.880
about the two-sided limits and how we can handle those.

01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:42.440
If you remember in our previous lesson we talked about coming in from the left and coming

01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:44.080
in from the right.

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:58.240
So for a two-sided limits the left and the right must be equal.

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:07.920
So if we're working with a piecewise function like f of x is equal to x plus three if x

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:15.800
is greater than negative three and it's equal to x squared if x is less than or equal to

01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:23.520
negative three, we need to consider at negative three what's happening on the left and the

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:26.080
right.

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:37.120
So first let's look at the limit as x approaches negative three from the left of f of x.

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.320
From the left we're dealing with smaller values of negative three, smaller values less than

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:44.560
or equal to three is x squared.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:50.720
So we'll directly plug in the negative three into the x squared or negative three squared

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:53.560
which is nine.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:38:02.520
Let's compare that with the limit as x approaches negative three from the right of f of x.

01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:07.960
And from the right we're talking about bigger values or x is greater than negative three.

01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:18.360
So that's the x plus three direct substitution, negative three plus three is equal to zero

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:25.400
and what you'll notice is those two limits are not the same.

01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:33.520
So what does that mean about the limit as x approaches three of f of x?

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:41.400
Well we know it does not exist.

01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:52.440
Let's do one more example of a two-sided limit with a piecewise function.

01:38:52.440 --> 01:39:05.280
Let's look at f of x equals two x if x is less than two and x squared if x is greater

01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:08.880
than or equal to two.

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:10.760
So what's the limit at two?

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:14.480
Well we've got to come in from each side.

01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:20.840
The limit as x approaches two from the left of f of x, from the left those are the smaller

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.120
values where x is less than two.

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.160
So let's plug in two.

01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:31.080
Two times two is equal to four.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:38.200
Looking at the other side the limit as x approaches two from the right of f of x, coming from

01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:43.200
the right means we want bigger values or when x is greater than or equal to two.

01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:46.640
So we'll plug it into x squared.

01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:51.760
Two squared is equal to four.

01:39:51.760 --> 01:39:59.720
This time you notice we have the same value for both the left and the right-sided limits.

01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:05.920
When we have the same value then we can say the limit as x approaches two of f of x still

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.720
does exist.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.320
In fact that limit is four.

01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:16.520
Whatever is the same on both the left and the right side.

01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:20.800
So the important thing with piecewise functions is we have to be equal to the same number

01:40:20.800 --> 01:40:27.960
on both sides of the function.

01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:31.440
With our limit discussion we talked a bit about infinite limits.

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:39.760
So let's look at how we can work with infinite limits, calculating them with this whole

01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:44.200
idea of substitution.

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:56.080
With infinite limits there are two properties that will help us calculate the infinite limits.

01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:06.800
First property is that the limit as x approaches a from the left of one over x minus a.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:15.560
And for coming in from the left on this guide this function will always go to negative infinity.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:21.200
Because all the pieces are positive it's going to go down to negative infinity.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:28.280
Similarly as x approaches a from the right of one over x minus a, coming in from the

01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:37.240
right we're going to go up to positive infinity.

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:44.600
These two limits are going to be the key to finding infinite limits by hand rather than

01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:51.840
going through the table method or the graph method.

01:41:51.840 --> 01:42:02.460
Let's first look at the limit as x approaches two from the left of x plus one over x squared

01:42:02.460 --> 01:42:08.620
minus four.

01:42:08.620 --> 01:42:12.920
We can't directly plug two in because it makes it undefined so we would start to factor

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:18.800
to see if that helps us to see if we can remove the discontinuity.

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:27.080
So x plus one over x squared minus four is x plus two times x minus two but the frustrating

01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:35.480
part there is that x minus two doesn't divide out so we can't divide out the bad part.

01:42:35.480 --> 01:42:45.360
So what we'll do is we'll isolate the bad part in a separate fraction one over the bad

01:42:45.360 --> 01:42:48.160
part.

01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:56.640
This is going to give us the limit as x approaches two from the left of x plus one over x plus

01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:07.440
two times one over x minus two.

01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:17.320
Now we can do direct substitution on the good part and for the bad part that's been isolated

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:23.240
we're coming in from the left and we know when we come in from the left that's going

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:29.280
to go to a negative infinity.

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.560
So let's look at each of these pieces.

01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:44.800
In two-in we've got two plus one over two plus two times the negative infinity.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:56.800
Well two plus one is three, two plus two is four times the negative infinity.

01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:01.120
The answer here is going to be infinity but what we have to decide is we've got a positive

01:44:01.120 --> 01:44:08.860
times a negative is going to equal a negative and so we end up with this function going

01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:14.960
out to negative infinity.

01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:20.320
Let's do that one more time where we isolate the bad part.

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.040
Let's come in from the other direction.

01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:28.400
Let's take the limit as x goes to two from the right of the x plus one over x squared

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.800
minus four.

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:41.680
And again we start out the same as x going to two from the right by factoring the denominator

01:44:41.680 --> 01:44:51.000
to x plus two x minus two and then isolating the bad part as a fraction one over that and

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:59.400
so we end up with the limit as x goes to two from the right of x plus one over x plus

01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:09.280
two times the bad part of one over x minus two.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:14.440
This time we're going in from the plus or positive side that's the second property that's

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:21.200
now going to go to a positive infinity.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.120
So when we make our substitution step we're going to plug positive infinity in for that

01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:28.560
second part.

01:45:28.560 --> 01:45:37.360
Plugging two in we have two plus one over two plus two times positive infinity which is three

01:45:37.360 --> 01:45:40.920
fourths times positive infinity.

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:46.640
A positive times a positive is positive.

01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:52.520
This graph is going to positive infinity from the right.

01:45:52.520 --> 01:46:01.040
I have one more limit trick that I want to look at.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:09.040
We call this guy the squeeze theorem and it's particularly useful to find limits with trig

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:14.160
properties.

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:24.080
The idea with the squeeze theorem is if I've got some function and I don't know what the

01:46:24.080 --> 01:46:34.760
limit is but I can find a function that goes above it and a function that goes below it

01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:40.640
so that they all meet in the center at the same exact point.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:55.760
So we've got one that's always above, one that's always below, but they all meet together

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.160
in the same point.

01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:07.640
At that same point they will all have the same limit.

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:15.120
If they all meet at the same point.

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:19.040
My picture doesn't show them meeting at the same point really well but the idea is the

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.360
top one, the bottom one, and the middle function all converge together at that same point in

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:26.000
the center.

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:32.680
Then they all have the same exact limit.

01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:34.920
Let me show you what this looks like.

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:42.400
Let's say we want to know the limit as x goes to zero of x squared times the cosine of x.

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:47.640
We don't have a limit rule yet that says we can just plug the number into the cosine just

01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:55.480
into polynomials, into fractions, into multiplication, into radicals, but not into cosine so we need

01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:59.120
to use the squeeze theorem to get at it.

01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:04.760
How the squeeze theorem works is we're going to look particularly at the cosine and say

01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:12.280
one thing we know about the cosine, not the sine, the cosine.

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:16.760
The cosine of x has a very bounded domain.

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:21.760
It's always between a negative one and a positive one.

01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:24.840
Same thing for the sine.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:31.760
So what we want to do is manipulate this inequality so that it looks like the entire function

01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:36.000
x squared times the cosine.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:40.760
Well the center is just missing a multiply by x squared.

01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:49.040
So if we do that on all three parts, we end up with negative x squared is less than or

01:48:49.040 --> 01:49:00.520
equal to x squared cosine x, which is less than or equal to x squared.

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:08.040
We can take the limit of each of these parts, the limit as x goes to zero of negative x

01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:15.000
squared is less than or equal to the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x, which

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:20.000
is less than or equal to the limit as x goes to zero of x squared.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:27.200
And what's nice about this is the left and the right we can do direct substitution on.

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:34.480
If I plug in zero we get negative zero squared, which is just zero, is less than or equal

01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:43.320
to the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x, which is less than or equal to here

01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:45.360
we have a polynomial.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:51.660
Direct substitution we plug zero in, zero squared is just zero.

01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:59.060
So if the limit is less than zero and greater than zero or equal to it must be equal to

01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:01.980
zero.

01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:14.020
So the limit as x goes to zero of x squared cosine x is equal to zero because it's been

01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:22.460
squeezed in between these other two functions that both go to zero.

01:50:22.460 --> 01:50:26.580
They all are at the same point, they all have the same limit.

01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:32.180
One is always below and one is always above.

01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:34.940
So that wraps up our discussion of all of the limit tricks.

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:37.340
The basic idea is direct substitution.

01:50:37.340 --> 01:50:44.700
We want to plug the number that we have for the limit into the function and simplify.

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:49.660
We have a couple tricks we did if that doesn't work to get it to a point that it does work.

01:50:49.660 --> 01:51:00.140
But ultimately if we can plug the number in it's very easy to take the limit.

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:04.500
Working with limits leads us directly into an important conversation around the topic

01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.100
of continuity.

01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:22.820
So we're going to answer the question when is a function continuous?

01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:27.980
Well in order to determine when the function is or is not continuous we need to know what

01:51:27.980 --> 01:51:34.700
continuous means.

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:38.620
First kind of an informal definition.

01:51:38.620 --> 01:51:59.420
The idea of continuous means basically I can draw the graph without lifting my pencil.

01:51:59.420 --> 01:52:08.020
It's just a continuous curve without lifting the pencil for a gap or a jump or an asymptote.

01:52:08.020 --> 01:52:11.180
It's just continuous.

01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:23.020
Now a more formal mathematical definition states that a continuous function will satisfy

01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:37.860
three conditions for all points and we'll call those points A.

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:44.900
The first condition is that F of A is defined.

01:52:44.900 --> 01:52:49.860
So the function can't be undefined at the given point.

01:52:49.860 --> 01:53:03.460
In addition we need the limit as X approaches A of F of X to exist.

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:08.100
So for example if the function is approaching two different numbers from two different sides

01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:10.820
the limit does not exist.

01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.380
But the all important one that we probably go to to check the most for continuity is

01:53:15.380 --> 01:53:25.380
that the limit as X approaches A of F of X is actually equal to whatever F of A is.

01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:31.100
In other words we can do the direct substitution to calculate the limit because the limit is

01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:36.700
equal to the point itself.

01:53:36.700 --> 01:53:42.220
These three definitions and specifically this last one being the most important are what

01:53:42.220 --> 01:53:47.660
makes a function continuous.

01:53:47.660 --> 01:53:53.020
So what does it mean to be discontinuous or not a continuous function?

01:53:53.020 --> 01:54:07.420
Well there are actually three types of discontinuity which means not continuous.

01:54:07.420 --> 01:54:19.300
The first type of discontinuity is what we call a removable discontinuity.

01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:22.300
And here's what a removable discontinuity looks like.

01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:35.300
It's something like F of X equals X squared plus X minus 12 over X minus 3.

01:54:35.300 --> 01:54:43.840
Notice if we tried to calculate F of 3 or just directly substitute the 3 in we would

01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:52.420
get 3 squared plus 3 minus 12 which is 0 divided by, the important part, 3 minus 3 is 0 and

01:54:52.420 --> 01:54:57.660
we can't divide by 0.

01:54:57.660 --> 01:55:04.620
So F of X or F of A, F of 3 is undefined.

01:55:04.620 --> 01:55:14.340
However if I took my function and I factored it, we'd get what, 4 and 3 plus 4 and minus

01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:25.660
3 over X minus 3, we can then divide out the X minus 3 and we've removed the discontinuity

01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:27.780
or the problem.

01:55:27.780 --> 01:55:39.020
Now because we've been able to remove the discontinuity we could calculate the limit.

01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:45.540
So this is a removable discontinuity because we were able to algebraically remove the part

01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:49.540
that was discontinuous.

01:55:49.540 --> 01:56:01.060
Now the way this looks on a graph, and we'll go ahead and just graph this same function,

01:56:01.060 --> 01:56:06.980
not to scale here, so we'll come up and call this 4 here.

01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:13.660
But the idea is this graph is going to go through 4 and it's going to have a hole that's

01:56:13.660 --> 01:56:19.000
been removed right at 3 that it goes around.

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:26.320
We can't graph this without lifting our pencil because we have to lift our pencil at the

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:29.840
hole in the graph.

01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:40.280
So we could say that the hole in the graph is removable.

01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:44.520
It is a removable discontinuity.

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.920
The first type of discontinuity.

01:56:49.920 --> 01:57:01.880
The second type of discontinuity that we're going to look at is called an infinite discontinuity.

01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:19.400
And the example we're going to use here is f of x is equal to x minus 3 over x plus 1.

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:29.500
We would end up with a vertical asymptote at 1.

01:57:29.500 --> 01:57:31.860
And there's actually also a horizontal asymptote at 1.

01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:42.820
So this graph looks like this, no it doesn't, it looks like this.

01:57:42.820 --> 01:58:03.260
But specifically what we find is the infinite discontinuity.

01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:08.260
So that is our second type of discontinuity.

01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:16.660
The third type of discontinuity is what we call a jump discontinuity.

01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:22.020
And it does exactly what you'd expect the graph to do, it jumps.

01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:30.820
So if we have f of x equals the piecewise function x squared minus 1 for x less than

01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:44.620
1 and x plus 1 for x greater than or equal to 1, what we're going to find is the limit

01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:47.260
again is not going to exist.

01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:54.900
Because if we take the limit as x goes to 1 from the left, or smaller values, we use

01:58:54.900 --> 01:58:57.500
the first equation.

01:58:57.500 --> 01:59:05.740
So we'll directly substitute 1 into x squared minus 1, and we get 1 squared minus 1, which

01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:07.820
is 0.

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:14.700
And we compare that to the limit coming in from the right of 1.

01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:17.100
Well coming in from the right we want the bigger values.

01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:24.700
So we'll plug it into x plus 1 or 1 plus 1, which is 2.

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:34.940
And because these are not the same, we have a jump in the graph.

01:59:34.940 --> 01:59:45.380
And the limit as x approaches 1 again does not exist.

01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:48.340
What does this look like as a graph?

01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:52.340
Looks like you'd expect it to.

01:59:52.340 --> 02:00:03.820
It's x squared minus 1, so it's going to come down.

02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:11.140
And then we've got a jump at 1, and then it turns into the line.

02:00:11.140 --> 02:00:19.300
That's specifically what we're interested in is the graph jumps.

02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:25.900
So again the whole idea of discontinuity versus continuity is can you draw the graph without

02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:27.860
lifting your pencil?

02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:37.820
Specifically does the function at a equal to limit as x approaches a?

02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:44.100
Kind of a corollary that comes out of this idea of continuity is this idea of what we

02:00:44.100 --> 02:00:57.260
call the intermediate value theorem, which is often abbreviated with the first letters

02:00:57.260 --> 02:01:01.980
IVT, intermediate value theorem.

02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:13.620
And what the intermediate value theorem says is that if a function f of x is continuous,

02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:23.540
if the function always equals its limit on some interval from a to b, and there's another

02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:46.820
number z that's between f of a and f of b, then there exists another number, we'll call

02:01:46.820 --> 02:02:04.100
it c, that is NAB such that f of c will equal that z.

02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:05.980
Okay that definition is really weird.

02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:12.220
Let's draw a picture that really illustrates what this means.

02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:22.620
I've got a graph, we're going to go from a to c, a to b, sorry.

02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:26.140
So the graph goes from a to b.

02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:33.300
Say a is down low, b is up high, and it might do something interesting and crazy, but it's

02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:40.900
continuous so I can draw it without lifting my pencil and go all the way from a to b.

02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:48.420
Well a hits at f of a and b hits up on top at f of b.

02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:56.620
The idea of the intermediate value theorem is I can pick any z that is between f of a

02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:02.820
and f of b, any z I want.

02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:18.940
And wherever I pick that z, there is a guarantee that there will be a solution, some c that

02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:23.020
will get me that solution.

02:03:23.020 --> 02:03:29.340
In fact there could be more than one solution, if I pick a z kind of down towards the center

02:03:29.340 --> 02:03:33.140
you see there's three solutions in there.

02:03:33.140 --> 02:03:42.900
But there's always at least one solution for any z that's in the middle of those.

02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:48.140
Basically we're going to hit every single value all the way up from f of a to f of b

02:03:48.140 --> 02:03:53.500
because there's no other way to connect the dots.

02:03:53.500 --> 02:04:01.700
Now there's a couple of cautions about what this theorem actually says.

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:08.780
So before we get to an example of how to use it, I want to make sure we clearly understand

02:04:08.780 --> 02:04:13.460
what this is actually saying.

02:04:13.460 --> 02:04:20.060
First the definition started out that if f is continuous.

02:04:20.060 --> 02:04:37.700
This does not work if f is not continuous.

02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:43.580
But it could.

02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:48.740
We just don't have the guarantee that we get from continuity.

02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:53.100
So drawing a picture of what I mean by that.

02:04:53.100 --> 02:04:58.020
Here we've got a, here we've got b.

02:04:58.020 --> 02:05:02.860
So there's a point at a and there's a point at b.

02:05:02.860 --> 02:05:07.640
So we've got f of b and f of a.

02:05:07.640 --> 02:05:13.100
The intermediate value theorem says that I can pick any z in between f of a and f of

02:05:13.100 --> 02:05:17.820
b, as long as it's continuous.

02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:28.620
But if this function just kind of goes like this, and then there's a jump discontinuity

02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:37.040
and it goes like that, notice if I pick a z right in the middle of that jump discontinuity

02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:41.180
I do not get a solution.

02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:46.460
I could if I picked a z up high enough that it actually hit the graph.

02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:54.140
I could get a result, but I'm not guaranteed a result because of that jump discontinuity.

02:05:54.140 --> 02:06:03.020
So it does not work if f is not continuous.

02:06:03.020 --> 02:06:27.980
The other important thing is it does not work if z is outside of f of a and f of b.

02:06:27.980 --> 02:06:31.940
But it could.

02:06:31.940 --> 02:06:33.180
Again it could work.

02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:38.500
We just don't have that guarantee.

02:06:38.500 --> 02:06:48.860
So again we're going to go from a to b, a's here, b's here, which means f of a is at the

02:06:48.860 --> 02:06:55.300
lower point where a is, f of b at the higher point.

02:06:55.300 --> 02:07:06.900
And if f of a is connected somehow, but my z is too low or too high, I'm not guaranteed

02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:10.980
that it's going to work, that I'm going to cross the graph.

02:07:10.980 --> 02:07:15.280
It doesn't necessarily mean no though because if the graph did go up and down and really

02:07:15.280 --> 02:07:19.860
wiggle it could go down and hit z.

02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:23.940
But I don't have any guarantee that it does.

02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:30.220
So it's really important for the intermediate value theorem that z has to be between the

02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:37.220
two y values.

02:07:37.220 --> 02:08:00.800
The one other thing this tells us, this theorem only tells us there is at least one solution.

02:08:00.800 --> 02:08:10.500
There may or may not be more.

02:08:10.500 --> 02:08:18.380
And I kind of hinted at this with my original drawing.

02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:27.180
But again we've got a and we've got b, put a down low and b up high and the graph is

02:08:27.180 --> 02:08:38.640
going to wiggle, but specifically f of a aligns with a and f of b aligns with b.

02:08:38.640 --> 02:08:46.120
And if I pick z in the middle of this graph, what you'll see is I actually get one, two,

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:47.240
three solutions.

02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:55.040
So there's actually three points that work that could be our c.

02:08:55.040 --> 02:09:00.420
We are guaranteed with the intermediate value theorem that there is at least one solution

02:09:00.420 --> 02:09:03.020
for z.

02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:14.560
There could be more, but we have no way of knowing if there is or is not more.

02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:24.940
So that's really what this intermediate value theorem is trying to say is if f of x is continuous

02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:34.640
and our z is somewhere between those y values of f of a and f of b, then there exists at

02:09:34.640 --> 02:09:46.600
least one c such that when we plug c into the function we get z for a solution.

02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:51.680
How do we use this?

02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:53.400
Well here's how we use this.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:10:04.660
We use this to show that we do have solutions to functions even if we can't solve them.

02:10:04.660 --> 02:10:28.820
We can show that zero equals one over x plus sine x has at least one solution.

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:34.040
We know this function is continuous except at zero.

02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:42.700
So we're going to stay away from zero so that we're continuous between our a and our b.

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:49.580
In order to show that it has one solution, what we're going to attempt to do, a solution

02:10:49.580 --> 02:10:55.100
happens at zero it says, what we're going to attempt to do is find the point where the

02:10:55.100 --> 02:10:58.400
graph crosses zero.

02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:05.600
Notice before zero the graph is negative.

02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:13.480
After zero this graph is positive.

02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:18.680
Zero is going to be between negative and positive.

02:11:18.680 --> 02:11:28.180
So if I can show that there is a solution that's negative and that this guy has a solution

02:11:28.180 --> 02:11:37.380
that's positive, everything between it including zero must exist.

02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:44.820
One thing we know about sine is where is sine positive?

02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:48.420
We're going to add sine of x.

02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:55.160
Sine is the y-coordinate on the unit circle, so I imagine my unit circle.

02:11:55.160 --> 02:12:02.800
The y-coordinate is positive, so let's make a note of what we're doing here.

02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:26.780
We need to find a negative and positive solution or better than saying solution let's say output

02:12:26.780 --> 02:12:39.360
four f of x and then zero between it must exist as an output.

02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:44.440
So on the unit circle sine, sine is the y-coordinate.

02:12:44.440 --> 02:12:51.600
The y-coordinate I notice is very positive up here on top, that's at pi over two and

02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:59.260
it's also very negative down here at the bottom at three pi over two.

02:12:59.260 --> 02:13:04.620
Let's see what those give us when we plug them in.

02:13:04.620 --> 02:13:12.900
So let's find f of pi over two which is equal to one over pi over two plus the sine of pi

02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:18.220
over two.

02:13:18.220 --> 02:13:25.480
One over pi over two that's the reciprocal, so we have two over pi plus the sine of pi

02:13:25.480 --> 02:13:28.720
over two is one.

02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:37.640
That's definitely positive, actually if I put it in my calculator I get 1.64 or so.

02:13:37.640 --> 02:13:41.720
Then the other point to try and get negative, we said the most negative point for sine is

02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:44.320
at three pi over two.

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:47.400
So let's see what that gives us.

02:13:47.400 --> 02:14:00.860
One over three pi over two plus the sine of three pi over two is equal to one of the reciprocal

02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:11.260
of three pi over two is two over three pi plus the sine of three pi over two is negative

02:14:11.260 --> 02:14:13.060
one.

02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:21.400
Sure enough that's negative point seven eight eight.

02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:26.800
Therefore, by the way these three triangles, these three dots in a triangle that means

02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:33.320
therefore, it's a nice shorthand for mathematicians.

02:14:33.320 --> 02:14:50.420
Therefore we know that all outputs between 1.64 and negative point seven eight eight are

02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:56.020
possible.

02:14:56.020 --> 02:15:17.760
Probably they're possible when x is between three pi over two and pi over two.

02:15:17.760 --> 02:15:31.520
Therefore zero, which is between those values, is a solution.

02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:37.340
The intermediate value theorem tells us that there has to be a result in output between

02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:44.140
1.64 and negative point seven eight eight.

02:15:45.140 --> 02:15:54.040
Therefore zero is a solution.

02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:57.740
That's a quick look at continuity and the intermediate value theorem.

02:15:57.740 --> 02:16:01.480
Take a look at some of the problems in your book to practice this a bit, but I'll look

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:09.580
forward to seeing you in class so we can talk about continuity a little bit more.

02:16:09.580 --> 02:16:13.960
Thus far in our studies of limit, we have kind of been waving our hands over the definition

02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:19.620
of a limit and talking more generally about the definition rather than the precise definition.

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:21.820
That's what we're going to take a look at today.

02:16:21.820 --> 02:16:38.460
The question is what is the precise definition of a limit?

02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:49.680
First we're going to look at the definition and then we'll take a look at the meat of

02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:55.120
this lesson, which is how do we show that a value actually is the limit of some type

02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:57.120
of function.

02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:05.000
First graphically to get an idea of what we're going to be talking about here, let's say

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:16.860
we've got some graph, maybe it curves up like this.

02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:28.540
We want to know what is the limit of f of x as x approaches some number, actually let's

02:17:28.540 --> 02:17:37.760
call it a not c as x approaches a of f of x.

02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:45.400
The way we actually define the derivative is we're going to move from a out a little

02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:50.120
bit each direction because remember our limit, we need both sides.

02:17:50.120 --> 02:17:55.420
That little tiny change that we move, we call delta.

02:17:55.420 --> 02:18:05.140
We add delta and we subtract delta to get to two more spots.

02:18:05.140 --> 02:18:17.060
The idea is if I go up to the point on the graph, what I can do is I can box in the actual

02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:25.600
point on the graph within that range.

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:29.960
The point on the graph in green here where a actually hits or where a should be, it might

02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:30.960
not actually be there.

02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:34.360
We're going to call that l the limit.

02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:45.120
The idea is that the deltas will box it in within some epsilon above or epsilon below.

02:18:45.120 --> 02:18:49.860
The challenge that we're going to have is to find the connection between the delta that

02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:56.900
we move left and right on the bottom and the epsilon that we move up and down from the

02:18:56.900 --> 02:18:59.260
right.

02:18:59.260 --> 02:19:04.740
The idea is if we zoom in and zoom in and zoom in and get closer and closer to the actual

02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:10.420
point, we'll continue to be boxed in around some epsilon.

02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:13.620
That box is what allows us to not actually have a point there because we just have to

02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.360
be around the point.

02:19:15.360 --> 02:19:20.760
Basically infinitely close to the point but not actually at the point, what are we at?

02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:26.840
For every epsilon, we need to be able to find a delta.

02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:35.920
This is what gives rise to, in words, the precise definition for the limit.

02:19:35.920 --> 02:19:49.180
We say that for all epsilon, greater than zero, that there exists a delta greater than

02:19:49.180 --> 02:20:04.300
zero, another Greek letter, such that if the absolute value of x minus a is less than delta,

02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:13.000
remember a is that x-coordinate that we want to find the limit at, then the absolute value,

02:20:13.000 --> 02:20:18.520
we do absolute value because we can do plus or minus, the absolute value of f of x minus

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:25.520
l is less than epsilon.

02:20:25.520 --> 02:20:35.580
In other words, on the right side, we're within an epsilon of the actual limit.

02:20:35.580 --> 02:20:40.060
Because mathematicians like to show off and make things more complicated than they really

02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:50.500
are, we actually can represent this entire definition symbolically.

02:20:50.500 --> 02:20:55.800
This is a neat party trick is to just be able to write down really quick the precise definition

02:20:55.800 --> 02:20:59.120
of a limit without writing a single word.

02:20:59.120 --> 02:21:02.000
Here is symbolically the precise definition of a limit.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:03.400
This is a thing of beauty.

02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:14.640
The limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l implies that for all epsilon greater than

02:21:14.640 --> 02:21:22.100
zero, there exists a delta greater than zero such that the absolute value of x minus a

02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:31.400
is less than delta implies that the absolute value of f of x minus the limit is less than

02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:35.900
epsilon.

02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:42.820
So a great party trick is the precise definition of a limit.

02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:53.160
I enjoy putting this on the test for extra credit, but it is quite fancy looking.

02:21:53.160 --> 02:21:56.920
What we really want to be able to do with this definition, though, is actually be able

02:21:56.920 --> 02:22:01.800
to take a limit and say, hey, if this is the limit, I can prove it's actually the limit

02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:06.400
by identifying this relationship between epsilon and delta.

02:22:06.400 --> 02:22:12.820
We call these our epsilon delta proofs, and every single proof looks identical.

02:22:12.820 --> 02:22:24.340
And so to help you set up your proofs, I'm going to show you the structure of the proof

02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:32.020
that the limit as x approaches a of f of x equals l.

02:22:32.020 --> 02:22:36.760
We're going to do four steps, and three of the four steps are really scripted, and the

02:22:36.760 --> 02:22:41.720
fourth one is just a little bit of algebra that's actually quite easy.

02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:49.920
The first step is you're always going to say, we let epsilon be greater than zero.

02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:52.760
That has to be true, and that's always the same.

02:22:52.760 --> 02:22:55.280
Every proof, let epsilon be greater than zero.

02:22:55.280 --> 02:23:03.900
Then you'll say, choose a delta that is equal to something, and actually we're going to

02:23:03.900 --> 02:23:06.900
find this later.

02:23:06.900 --> 02:23:18.420
I should do that in a different color because it's not actually part of the proof.

02:23:18.420 --> 02:23:21.620
Usually that something is going to have the epsilon in it because it's going to show the

02:23:21.620 --> 02:23:24.500
relationship between epsilon and delta.

02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:30.880
Just leave it blank temporarily because the next thing you do is you assume the absolute

02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:40.960
value of x minus a is less than the delta.

02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:49.600
Then you say the absolute value of f of x minus the limit is equal to, and then you

02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:57.700
do some algebra.

02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:04.360
After some algebra, you're going to ultimately say that's less than something, which is going

02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:12.520
to require you to do some more algebra.

02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:15.520
That will ultimately equal epsilon.

02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:20.320
Move that arrow so it's a little nicer.

02:24:20.320 --> 02:24:26.760
Maybe make it blue.

02:24:26.760 --> 02:24:29.560
Every single proof is going to look exactly the same.

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:33.920
The only place where you actually have to do any work is in this dot, dot, dot.

02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:38.840
While you do that dot, dot, dot of algebra, it's going to tell you what you're ultimately

02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:45.000
going to put in back in step number two for that delta.

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:48.320
Three steps one, two, and three, we usually throw out on one line because they are so

02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:50.720
straightforward.

02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:51.720
Let's do a couple examples.

02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:55.520
I've got four examples of proofs, and then you can practice some on your own.

02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:02.560
First let's do some linear examples.

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:08.200
Just kind of as a tip, if we're dealing with a linear equation like y equals mx plus b,

02:25:08.200 --> 02:25:16.040
with linear examples, the delta is generally equal to epsilon divided by something.

02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:22.280
You have to figure out what that something is.

02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:31.920
Following that same structure, first we're going to prove that the limit as x approaches

02:25:31.920 --> 02:25:39.800
three of four x minus seven equals five.

02:25:39.800 --> 02:25:51.440
Notice that three is the a, what x is approaching, five is the limit or l, and the four x minus

02:25:51.440 --> 02:25:55.560
seven, that's the function.

02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:58.200
So here's our proof.

02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:03.680
We always say let epsilon be greater than zero.

02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:15.880
Choose a delta that's equal to something, we'll leave that blank, and then we will assume

02:26:15.880 --> 02:26:25.520
the absolute value of x minus a, a is what the limit is approaching, is less than delta.

02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:29.880
That part's really scripted, the only gap is we don't know what delta equals yet.

02:26:29.880 --> 02:26:33.240
We're going to go back and fill that in in a minute.

02:26:33.240 --> 02:26:38.960
Now we're going to take the absolute value of f of x minus l, let's put f of x in there

02:26:38.960 --> 02:26:44.880
actually, f of x is the function, four x minus seven, and then subtract the limit, which

02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:52.400
is five, and now we're going to play with this and do some algebra.

02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:56.280
What you might see immediately is we can combine like terms on the seven and the five, so we

02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:04.720
have the absolute value of four x minus twelve, and then what we ultimately want to do is

02:27:04.720 --> 02:27:11.400
we want to find some absolute value of x minus three, so we can use what we assumed.

02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:16.120
What you might see here is all we have to do is factor out the four, and we get the

02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:21.520
absolute value of x minus three.

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:29.800
We know that the absolute value of x minus three is less than delta, so we're ready

02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:34.160
to do our less than statement.

02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:45.840
It's less than four times the absolute value, which is less than delta.

02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:53.120
This is where we know now what we want delta to be, because what we ultimately want to

02:27:53.120 --> 02:28:01.560
do is when we multiply by four, all that's left is epsilon, so delta then is going to

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:05.440
be the reciprocal of what we're multiplying by.

02:28:05.440 --> 02:28:14.500
The reciprocal of four is one over four, so delta is equal to epsilon over four, and we

02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:18.260
stick that into the first line.

02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:22.740
That might not be very clear, but it becomes clear why that's useful in the very next step,

02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:30.220
because now we have four times delta is equal to epsilon over four, and now the fours divide

02:28:30.220 --> 02:28:36.620
out leaving just the epsilon.

02:28:36.620 --> 02:28:48.100
If we're able to simplify the f of x minus l and say it is less than epsilon, we have

02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:56.300
proven that this limit is actually equal to what we said it was equal to.

02:28:56.300 --> 02:29:00.980
When we're done with the proof, there's a couple ways we show that we're done in mathematics.

02:29:00.980 --> 02:29:06.580
The most common way is we write at the end QED.

02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:11.740
That's Latin for queterum dimestratum, that was what we wished to show.

02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:15.940
Another thing I see a lot of times is people put a little box and color it in, as if to

02:29:15.940 --> 02:29:19.220
check off that it's done.

02:29:19.220 --> 02:29:27.940
Another thing I've seen is W to the fifth, which stands for which was what we wanted.

02:29:27.940 --> 02:29:31.860
Now acknowledge though that you've gotten to the end of the proof, QED is really nice

02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:36.580
because it looks like you know Latin and it looks smart.

02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:40.540
Let's do one more linear example so that we can see kind of how another similar problem

02:29:40.540 --> 02:29:45.260
works, but every problem kind of has the same general setup.

02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:55.140
For this example we're going to prove that the limit as x goes to negative one of x squared

02:29:55.140 --> 02:30:05.180
plus four x plus three over x plus one is equal to two.

02:30:05.180 --> 02:30:10.500
Like before, identifying the pieces, what x is approaching, that's my A, what's inside

02:30:10.500 --> 02:30:17.540
the limit, that's the function, and the answer, that's my limit L.

02:30:17.540 --> 02:30:21.260
The first line is pretty scripted of every delta epsilon proof.

02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:24.600
We let epsilon be greater than zero.

02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:30.360
We choose a delta that's equal to something, leave some space, we'll come back, it's going

02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:38.160
to be the reciprocal of whatever we're multiplying delta by with an epsilon in the numerator.

02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:44.440
Then we will assume the absolute value of x minus A, which is negative one, minus the

02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:55.160
negative ones, the same as plus one, is less than delta.

02:30:55.160 --> 02:30:57.880
Now the next line is where we do our algebra.

02:30:57.880 --> 02:31:03.040
We take the absolute value of the function, which is x squared plus four x plus three

02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:10.080
over x plus one, and subtract the limit of two, and hopefully after massaging it a bit

02:31:10.160 --> 02:31:15.720
we end up saying this is less than epsilon.

02:31:15.720 --> 02:31:19.720
With rational expressions, we're really comfortable with factoring to reduce, so when we factor

02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:26.080
we get x plus three times x plus one over the x plus one, and we still have the minus

02:31:26.080 --> 02:31:29.920
two at the end.

02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:36.400
This is really nice because the x plus ones divide out, which leaves us with the absolute

02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:42.360
value of x plus three minus two.

02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:48.040
I'm going to run out of space on my next statement, so let's go ahead and use the next line and

02:31:48.040 --> 02:31:55.040
say equals the absolute value combining like terms of x plus one.

02:31:57.960 --> 02:32:02.760
This is actually really nice because this already is the part that's less than delta.

02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:05.960
This time we don't have to factor anything out.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:09.800
Just to keep things consistent though, I'm going to factor out a one, and say that's

02:32:09.800 --> 02:32:16.800
one times the absolute value, because we know that delta has to be the reciprocal of that

02:32:18.960 --> 02:32:21.600
number times epsilon.

02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:28.100
The reciprocal of one is just one, so we have epsilon over one, or just epsilon.

02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:35.100
Delta equals epsilon, because now I know that the x plus one is less than one.

02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:42.440
That's from my assume statement.

02:32:42.440 --> 02:32:49.440
X plus one is less than the delta, and we know that the delta is equal to the epsilon,

02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:57.200
which is what we defined at the beginning, and QED, we have proven that this limit equals

02:32:59.880 --> 02:33:03.440
two.

02:33:03.720 --> 02:33:08.400
Linear examples, our general strategy as we work through the steps is to make delta equal

02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:15.400
to the reciprocal of whatever is multiplied by delta.

02:33:15.400 --> 02:33:20.160
But we can also do quadratic examples pretty nicely.

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:27.160
Let's do a couple of those quadratic examples.

02:33:34.220 --> 02:33:39.880
With quadratics, what we're going to have to do is we're going to need a little bit

02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:45.640
of help to make delta come out right, and so we're going to actually give delta two

02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:47.360
options.

02:33:47.360 --> 02:33:54.360
Delta is always going to be equal to the minimum of one, and epsilon divided by something.

02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:03.080
We need that one to kind of set up what the divided by something is, and I'll show you

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:07.120
in just a minute, but with quadratics, when you see x squared, delta is going to be the

02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:14.120
minimum of one and the reciprocal, again, of what's being multiplied by delta.

02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:23.320
So let's see if we can prove that the limit as x approaches two of x squared minus three

02:34:24.320 --> 02:34:31.320
x is equal to negative two.

02:34:35.080 --> 02:34:42.080
Again, x is approaching our a value, the function is what's inside the limit, and l, the limit

02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:49.360
is the answer, and we start filling in our proof structure.

02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:57.360
First we let epsilon be greater than zero, then we choose a delta that's going to be

02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:05.840
equal to something we don't know yet, but we know with quadratics we have to do the

02:35:05.840 --> 02:35:10.400
minimum of one and something.

02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:17.400
We don't know what the something is yet, and then we will assume that the absolute value

02:35:18.160 --> 02:35:25.160
of x minus two, or our a that x is approaching, is less than delta.

02:35:33.020 --> 02:35:36.120
Then we go to that absolute value statement.

02:35:36.120 --> 02:35:42.480
The absolute value of our function, x squared minus three x, minus the limit, minus the

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:47.680
negative two, means plus two, and hopefully we'll work this down and ultimately say it's

02:35:47.680 --> 02:35:52.640
less than an epsilon.

02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:56.840
With quadratics we're probably very familiar with factoring.

02:35:56.840 --> 02:36:01.680
With absolute value we just keep the absolute values around each factor, so x squared is

02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:08.680
x times x, and if we do a minus two and a minus one, we're completely factored.

02:36:09.520 --> 02:36:16.520
What's nice here is that we've got the x minus two that we know is less than delta.

02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:23.040
So we're going to be able to say this is less than something times delta, but we need to

02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:30.040
know what to do with the x minus one bit.

02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:36.240
This is where it's going to take a little creativeness.

02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:42.600
How we're going to get to that creativeness is we're going to play with the algebra on

02:36:42.600 --> 02:36:49.600
x minus two is less than delta, and the fact that we said delta's going to be at most one.

02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:56.360
It's the minimum of one and something else.

02:36:56.360 --> 02:37:02.120
Let's see, we're going to play off to the side here, I guess I'll put it underneath.

02:37:02.120 --> 02:37:09.120
The absolute value of x minus two is less than delta, but delta's no bigger than one.

02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:15.840
If the absolute value is less than a number, what that really means is that the x minus

02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:22.840
two is between negative one and positive one.

02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:29.640
We want to know what to do with the x minus one, so we're going to try and change this

02:37:29.680 --> 02:37:36.680
middle stuff to become x minus one. To get x minus two to become x minus one, we're going

02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:44.280
to add one. Of course, if we add one there, we have to add one to all three parts. When

02:37:44.400 --> 02:37:51.400
we do, we get zero is less than x minus one, which is less than two.

02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:58.400
Now, we're going to change this back to an absolute value statement that the absolute

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:07.000
value of x minus one is less than something. We can either say the absolute value is less

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:14.000
than zero or less than two. We always will take the most extreme value because we want

02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:19.240
to be less than. We want to keep epsilon as small as possible, so we'll take the worst

02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:25.520
case scenario and say, worst case scenario, the two is more extreme. The worst case scenario,

02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:32.520
the absolute value of x minus one is less than two. That is what we're going to multiply

02:38:34.880 --> 02:38:41.880
delta by. x minus one, worst case scenario is two. x minus two, worst case scenario is

02:38:42.880 --> 02:38:49.880
delta. At least, we know that the absolute value of x minus two times x minus one is

02:38:53.960 --> 02:39:00.960
less than two times delta. Now, we know what to do with the epsilon. Epsilon divided by

02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:09.760
two, the reciprocal of the two, because it's multiplied by delta, to make the rest of the

02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:15.760
proof work. We have two times delta, which is epsilon over two. Two's divide out and

02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:22.760
we're just left with epsilon. We're done because we've said that the function minus

02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:32.520
the limit is less than epsilon. We can now say we're done. QED. I'm probably pronouncing

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:39.520
that wrong, but you don't know Latin, so you can't prove me wrong. Let's do one more quadratic

02:39:45.160 --> 02:39:50.360
because these take a little bit more trying to manipulate that second factor in order

02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:57.360
to figure out what our delta is going to equal. Let's prove that the limit as x approaches

02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:05.360
negative one of two x squared minus x plus one is equal to four. Again, identifying the

02:40:15.760 --> 02:40:22.760
pieces, x is approaching our A. The function is what we're taking the limit of and the

02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:30.160
answer that is L, our limit. The first three statements of our proof are pretty prescribed

02:40:31.560 --> 02:40:38.560
to us. Let epsilon be greater than zero. We will choose a delta that's equal to, we don't

02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:45.840
know exactly what it equals yet, but we do know because this is a quadratic, we're going

02:40:45.840 --> 02:40:52.840
to do the minimum of one and something, the reciprocal of whatever delta is multiplied

02:40:53.600 --> 02:41:00.600
by. Then we assume the absolute value of x minus our A, or what x is approaching, minus

02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:13.680
negative one means plus one is less than delta. Now, our algebraic statement is that the

02:41:15.840 --> 02:41:22.840
step, the function, two x squared minus x plus one minus the limit of four, a little

02:41:25.760 --> 02:41:32.760
bit of cleanup, the absolute value of two x squared minus x minus three. Hopefully,

02:41:35.600 --> 02:41:42.600
we can work with this and say it is ultimately less than epsilon. Well, we know we can factor

02:41:43.320 --> 02:41:50.320
it, two x and x. To kind of help my factoring, I know I'm ultimately going to try and get

02:41:54.280 --> 02:42:00.080
an x plus one. Hopefully, that x is an x plus one, which means the other one is probably

02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:06.080
a minus three. When I check that out, it does work. Plus two minus three is the minus one.

02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:12.800
Nice, that's what we wanted. Now, we have the x plus one that we like. We know that's

02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:19.800
less than delta, but we have to figure out what delta is multiplied by. We need to play

02:42:20.560 --> 02:42:27.560
with the two x minus three. Using what we assume, so kind of off to the side in our

02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:34.640
work, we assumed, going back to that assumption statement, we assume that x plus one is less

02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:41.800
than delta, which worst case scenario, it's going to be a one, the absolute value. We

02:42:43.040 --> 02:42:49.880
remove the absolute values by saying that's between positive one and negative one. Then,

02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:56.380
we want to massage this so that it looks like two x minus three, so we can figure out how

02:42:56.380 --> 02:43:03.380
extreme our situation is. I recommend doing the two x part first. We get it to equal

02:43:05.080 --> 02:43:12.080
two x by multiplying by two on all three parts. Make sure we distribute, so we get negative

02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:19.440
two is less than two x plus two, which is less than two. Bias number white board space.

02:43:24.000 --> 02:43:29.880
We want it to have a minus three, two x minus three. Right now, it's plus two. To get that

02:43:29.880 --> 02:43:34.880
to be minus three, we need to subtract five. Two minus five will be the minus three. We

02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:41.880
subtract five from all three parts, and we get negative seven is less than two x minus

02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:48.880
three, which is less than negative three. Changing it back to an absolute value expression, two

02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:59.160
x minus three is less than, and then we pick the most extreme case, so we're always ready

02:43:59.160 --> 02:44:03.920
for a worst case scenario. This time, the most extreme case is on the right side, seven

02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:10.920
being more extreme than the three, and positive because we're talking about absolute value.

02:44:11.720 --> 02:44:18.720
So two x minus three is less than seven. That is what is being multiplied by our delta,

02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:28.440
which also tells us the reciprocal means divide by seven, so our delta is epsilon over seven.

02:44:30.080 --> 02:44:36.920
So we have seven times delta, which is epsilon over seven. The sevens divide out, and we're

02:44:36.920 --> 02:44:43.920
just left with epsilon. So we've shown that f of x minus l is less than epsilon, which

02:44:50.240 --> 02:44:57.240
QED is what we wanted, that which was to be demonstrated.

02:45:00.160 --> 02:45:07.160
So that is your general proof for limit. We're just going to work with linear examples

02:45:09.640 --> 02:45:14.440
and quadratic examples. In this class, you can take more advanced classes if you really

02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:19.760
want to prove a whole bunch of delta epsilons, but you should be very familiar with how to

02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:26.240
set up the proof. Always let epsilon be greater than zero. Choose a delta equal to something,

02:45:26.240 --> 02:45:31.800
and then assume that x minus a is less than delta, and then ultimately we play with f

02:45:31.800 --> 02:45:38.800
of x minus l, that f of x minus l is less than epsilon, and if you do that, you've got

02:45:41.360 --> 02:45:47.600
a perfect delta epsilon proof. Practice a few of these. We will see you in class where

02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:54.280
we can talk more about these proofs in more detail.

02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:58.240
Number three is going to be all about the derivatives. So to start off, we really need

02:45:58.240 --> 02:46:04.000
to know what is the derivative. Specifically, when we say the derivative, what we're talking

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:11.000
about is the slope of a tangent line to a function. So the question we're going to answer

02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:18.240
is how do we find the slope of a tangent line?

02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:33.000
And really, to answer this question, when we want the slope of a tangent line through

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:39.840
a specific point, there are two methods. Both work equally well. Sometimes one is better

02:46:39.840 --> 02:46:46.840
than the other to find the slope of a tangent line.

02:46:55.280 --> 02:47:00.680
Also, by way of vocabulary, when we say the slope of a tangent line, what we're talking

02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:07.680
about is what is called in calculus the derivative, the rate of change instantaneously at that

02:47:09.280 --> 02:47:16.840
point. So the first method we're going to look at, kind of to set it up graphically,

02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:23.840
say we've got some curve going on here, and we've got some point that we want to look

02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:28.200
at. We want to know what is the slope, what is the rate of change of the tangent line at

02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:35.200
that point. So if I go up from a, we get a point on the line, and that is at f of a.

02:47:36.920 --> 02:47:41.120
Well to get a slope, we need a second point that we can calculate it off of. So we'll

02:47:41.120 --> 02:47:48.120
go off to the right here, and we'll pick some other random x, which has a point on the line

02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:55.960
and some f of x solution to that. So the coordinates of that second point in red are x, f of x,

02:47:59.360 --> 02:48:06.360
and the coordinates of the point in green are a, f of a. And the tangent line is the

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:13.840
line that connects those two dots. Actually that's a secant line. But the way we make

02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:19.120
that secant line, actually let's first talk about the secant line. What is the slope of

02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:26.120
the secant line? Well to get the slope of the secant line, it's just the slope of the

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:31.520
slope formula that we know already, y2 minus y1, and then we divide it by subtract the

02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:38.520
x's. So for the slope of the secant line, that's going to be f of x minus f of a, subtracting

02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:46.520
the y's, divided by x minus a, subtracting the x coordinates. And the way we make that

02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:56.280
secant line into a tangent line is we take x and move it closer and closer to a. We move

02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:03.280
x to a, and then that line is going to become less secant and more tangent. Well we know

02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:11.280
how to express that, that the slope of the tangent line then is the limit as x approaches

02:49:11.560 --> 02:49:18.560
a of that same function, f of x minus f of a, all over x minus a. So that is our first

02:49:25.760 --> 02:49:31.320
possible formula. It's going to be an important one for us for how to find the slope of the

02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:38.080
tangent line. There is a second way that's used quite often, and in fact we'll probably

02:49:38.080 --> 02:49:45.080
use it more often overall in the course, that is similar to what we just did. So again,

02:49:48.600 --> 02:49:55.600
we'll make our little graph, and we've got some curve going on. And we'll have some

02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:02.600
a, which goes up to a point at f of a. But instead of going over to some x randomly,

02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:14.320
we're going to increase what we call h. So we end up with a point over here that's a

02:50:14.320 --> 02:50:21.320
plus h. And actually let me do that in red. A plus h. And so the a plus h gets this point

02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:29.040
up here, and so what we actually end up with is f of a plus h. So if we want the slope

02:50:37.540 --> 02:50:44.540
of the secant line that connects these two together, just like before, the slope of the

02:50:45.040 --> 02:50:49.960
secant line is going to be equal to the difference in the y's divided by the difference in the

02:50:49.960 --> 02:50:55.560
x's. Let's go ahead and label that. This red point, the x coordinate is a plus h, and

02:50:55.560 --> 02:51:02.560
the y coordinate is f of a plus h. And then the green point is a comma f of a again. So

02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:13.760
for the slope, subtract the y's, f of a plus h, minus f of a, all over the x coordinates

02:51:14.120 --> 02:51:21.120
a plus h, minus a, which is nice because the a's actually subtract out to zero. So we really

02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:32.320
have is f of a plus h, minus f of a, all over h. And the way we make this slope into a,

02:51:32.320 --> 02:51:39.320
or the secant line into a tangent line, is we say we want that h, the amount we move

02:51:44.240 --> 02:51:51.240
over to be basically zero. So we make the h go to zero. Or we say that the slope of the

02:51:51.240 --> 02:51:58.240
tangent line is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of that function, f of a plus h, minus

02:52:09.360 --> 02:52:16.360
f of a, all over h. And that is the second way we can find the derivative at a point.

02:52:17.360 --> 02:52:23.240
And both of these functions are going to give us the same answer, but it's two ways to

02:52:23.240 --> 02:52:30.240
get at that same value. And sometimes one way will be easier than another way. So what

02:52:31.200 --> 02:52:35.240
we're going to do is we're going to work through three examples where we calculate the slope

02:52:35.240 --> 02:52:40.280
of the tangent line, and also the equation of the tangent line while we're at it. But

02:52:40.280 --> 02:52:45.120
we're going to solve it both ways so we can kind of compare how the two formulas work

02:52:45.160 --> 02:52:52.160
together. So our first example that we're going to do is a polynomial. First we're going

02:52:55.120 --> 02:52:59.680
to find the slope, and then we'll find the equation of the tangent line. Our polynomial

02:52:59.680 --> 02:53:06.680
is f of x equals x squared minus 3x. And we're going to find the slope of the tangent

02:53:07.680 --> 02:53:14.680
line at x equals 1. The first thing we need to know is what's the y-coordinate that we're

02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:23.680
working with. So f of 1 is equal to 1 squared minus 3 times 1, which is 1 minus 3 or negative

02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:32.680
2. So we're really working with 1 comma negative 2 as our point.

02:53:37.460 --> 02:53:42.880
So using our first formula to solve for the slope of the tangent line, we know that the

02:53:42.880 --> 02:53:49.880
slope is equal to the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus f of a all over x minus

02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:57.080
a. Plugging in what we have then, we've got the limit as x this time is going to 1. Of

02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:05.600
f of x, which is x squared minus 3x, subtract the f of a, which is what we just found, f

02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:13.000
of 1 is negative 2, so subtracting negative 2 is the same as adding 2, all over x minus

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:20.000
the 1. What we see here is we can't do direct substitution

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:24.360
because if we do, we divide by 0. But we worked with this problem a lot with limits in our

02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:30.860
previous unit, so we know we need to factor that numerator. It's going to be x minus 2

02:54:30.860 --> 02:54:37.860
times x minus 1 over the x minus 1. And when we do that, the x minus 1's can divide out.

02:54:39.500 --> 02:54:46.340
And now that we've removed that discontinuity, we can plug into our function the limit value

02:54:46.340 --> 02:54:53.340
of 1. So x minus 2 becomes 1 minus 2, which means we have a slope of negative 1. Now,

02:54:53.340 --> 02:55:00.340
I did say there were two definitions. Remember, the second definition would be as we took

02:55:05.900 --> 02:55:12.900
the limit as h goes to 0 of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h. So we have the limit

02:55:13.680 --> 02:55:20.680
as h goes to 0 of f of a plus h. Remember, a in this case is 1, so that really means

02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:35.080
1 plus h. So x squared becomes 1 plus h squared minus 3x, which is 1 plus h. And then we

02:55:36.080 --> 02:55:43.080
subtract f of a, which we've already figured out in blue up above, is negative 2. So minus

02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:50.580
negative 2 means plus 2 all over h. Multiplying out the pieces here, we've got the limit as

02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:57.580
h goes to 0. Squaring it, we get 1 plus 2h plus h squared minus 3 minus 3h plus 2. And

02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:13.080
all over h. What's nice here is if we do the 1 minus 3 plus 2, 1 plus 2 is 3 minus 3

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:24.000
is 0. So now, we've got 2, or the limit, as h goes to 0 of 2h plus h squared minus 3

02:56:35.200 --> 02:56:42.200
h all over h. Every single term there has an h in it that we can factor out to remove

02:56:43.760 --> 02:56:50.760
our discontinuity. H times 2 plus h minus 3 all over h. I probably could have combined

02:56:54.400 --> 02:57:01.400
the 2 and 3, wouldn't matter. But ultimately, those h's divide out, and now we can plug

02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:09.120
in the 0 for h. So we have 2 plus 0 minus 3, which is negative 1. We get the same slope

02:57:15.680 --> 02:57:22.680
of the tangent line. The slope at 1 is negative 1. Now that we know the slope, we can find

02:57:22.800 --> 02:57:29.800
the equation. Remember, the equation is y equals m times x minus 1. Now that we know

02:57:31.680 --> 02:57:38.680
minus x1 plus y1. So plugging in the pieces, y equals the slope of negative 1 times x minus

02:57:41.040 --> 02:57:48.040
the x-coordinate is 1, and the y-coordinate is negative 2. We have the equation of our

02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:55.640
tangent line. Let's try another example where we work through both of the formulas. Let's

02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:02.640
do a fraction. Let's say f of x is equal to 3 over x plus 1, and we want the slope of

02:58:14.040 --> 02:58:21.040
the tangent line at x equals 2. Well, first we need to know what the y-coordinate is at

02:58:21.640 --> 02:58:28.640
2. So we'll find f of a, or f of 2, remember that's the a, is equal to 3 over 2 plus 1,

02:58:36.240 --> 02:58:43.240
and 3 over 3 is just equal to 1. So we have the point x is 2, y is 1, or a is 2, and

02:58:43.800 --> 02:58:50.800
f of a is 1. We had two formulas to find the derivative, or the slope of the tangent line

02:58:53.800 --> 02:58:58.400
at 2. Both of them work, give you the same answer. We're going to do both just so that

02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:04.900
we can see it worked out both ways. The first is the limit as x approaches a of f of x minus

02:59:05.200 --> 02:59:12.200
f of a, all over x minus a. So for this function, we're doing the limit as x minus x minus x

02:59:13.320 --> 02:59:20.320
approaches 2 this time of the function, 3 over x plus 1, minus f of a. We've already found

02:59:22.280 --> 02:59:29.280
out that f of a is equal to 1, all over x minus the a, which is 2. What we see here is we've

02:59:32.720 --> 02:59:37.700
got a complex fraction inside a limit, but we've seen this before. We know we can get

02:59:37.700 --> 02:59:44.700
rid of that by multiplying by the x plus 1, distributing it through on top and bottom.

02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:52.980
And when we do, be careful with that negative sign. The x plus 1's are gone, and we get

02:59:52.980 --> 02:59:59.980
the limit as x goes to 2 of 3 minus 1x minus 1, all over x minus 2 times x plus 1.

03:00:08.220 --> 03:00:15.220
The limit as x goes to 2 of 2 minus x over x minus 2 times x plus 1. And we know 2 minus

03:00:20.620 --> 03:00:25.420
x and x minus 2 can divide out as long as there's a negative 1 left over, because the

03:00:25.420 --> 03:00:31.420
subtraction's in the wrong order. And now that we've removed that discontinuity, we

03:00:31.420 --> 03:00:36.700
can do direct substitution and plug 2 into the fraction. So we have negative 1 over x,

03:00:36.700 --> 03:00:43.700
which is 2 plus 1, and this gives us negative 1 third for our slope. The slope at 2 is

03:00:47.620 --> 03:00:54.620
negative 1 third. Let's try and work that out again, this time using our second definition

03:00:57.860 --> 03:01:03.860
of the derivative at a point, and that's the one where we take the limit as h goes to 0

03:01:03.860 --> 03:01:10.860
of f of a plus h minus f of a, all over h. So the limit as h goes to 0 of, this time we're

03:01:17.140 --> 03:01:24.140
going to take a plus h, a is 2, because we're at 2, so 2 plus h, of 3 over x, which is 2

03:01:26.620 --> 03:01:33.620
plus h plus 1 minus the f of the a. We can do direct substitution and plug 2 into the

03:01:33.860 --> 03:01:40.860
numerator. We know that's 1, all over x, or all over h. The simplifying step is going

03:01:43.420 --> 03:01:47.580
to feel almost exactly the same. We need to get rid of that denominator, so we're going

03:01:47.580 --> 03:01:54.580
to multiply by 2 plus h plus 1 all the way across the numerator and the denominator.

03:01:57.340 --> 03:02:02.540
We're going to leave the denominator factored, however, because that's going to reduce out

03:02:02.540 --> 03:02:09.120
the h in just a minute. First fraction, we're just left with 3 minus, distribute the negative

03:02:09.120 --> 03:02:16.120
one through, minus 2, minus h, minus 1, all over h, don't forget the limit as h goes

03:02:18.620 --> 03:02:25.620
to 0, all over h times 2 plus h plus 1, and we could have combined the 2 and the 1 if

03:02:25.620 --> 03:02:32.620
we wanted to. It's not going to make much difference. What's nice now, though, is if

03:02:33.860 --> 03:02:40.860
we do 3 minus 2 minus 1, that's completely gone. Why don't we do that simplifying? We

03:02:42.460 --> 03:02:49.460
have the limit as h goes to 0 of negative h over h times 2 plus 1 is 3 plus h. We notice

03:02:49.460 --> 03:02:56.460
those h's are gone. We've removed the discontinuity, and so we're able to just plug 0 in. We have

03:03:01.540 --> 03:03:08.540
negative 1 over 3 plus 0, which is negative 1 third.

03:03:08.540 --> 03:03:15.540
Same answer both times, so I'm feeling pretty confident going into my equation of the tangent

03:03:23.380 --> 03:03:30.380
line here. The equation is y equals my slope, negative 1 third times x minus the x coordinate,

03:03:31.220 --> 03:03:38.220
minus the x coordinate, which is 2, plus the y coordinate, which is 1. The equation of

03:03:38.220 --> 03:03:45.380
the tangent line to 3 over x plus 1 at x equals 2 is y equals negative 1 third times x minus

03:03:45.380 --> 03:03:52.860
2 plus 1. One more example that I want to work through using both equations. This one

03:03:52.860 --> 03:03:59.860
is going to be finding the derivative with a radical. We're going to find the derivative

03:04:00.660 --> 03:04:07.660
or the slope of the tangent line of f of x equals the square root of x plus 1 at x equals

03:04:10.580 --> 03:04:17.580
3. x equals 8, sorry, at x equals 8. So to do that, we first need to know the y coordinate.

03:04:17.580 --> 03:04:24.580
So f of 8 is equal to the square root of 8 plus 1. 8 plus 1 is 9. Square root is 3,

03:04:24.580 --> 03:04:31.580
so we're talking about the 0.8 comma 3. We have two ways to find the derivative. We're

03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:41.580
going to do both here, so you can see how they both work out. The first is the limit as x

03:04:42.580 --> 03:04:49.580
approaches a of f of x minus f of a all over x minus a. So for our problem, the limit as

03:04:52.220 --> 03:04:59.220
x is going to an x coordinate of 8 of f of x, which is the square root of x plus 1, minus

03:05:03.660 --> 03:05:10.660
f of a, and we just found out that f of 8 is 3, all over x minus a, and that a value

03:05:11.580 --> 03:05:18.580
was 8. Now we've worked with limits with removable discontinuities and radicals before. Our strategy

03:05:20.460 --> 03:05:25.940
in the past was we get rid of the radical by multiplying by the conjugate, and so we'll

03:05:25.940 --> 03:05:32.940
do just that. We'll multiply by the square root of x plus 1, change it to a plus 3 over

03:05:33.060 --> 03:05:39.060
the square root of x plus 1 plus 3, and that's going to remove the radical in the numerator

03:05:39.060 --> 03:05:46.060
and hopefully set up something we can reduce. So we now have the limit as x goes to 8. In

03:05:47.420 --> 03:05:52.580
the numerator, conjugates will just square both of them and put minus between them. When

03:05:52.580 --> 03:05:58.020
we square a square root, we're just left with the stuff x plus 1. Always a minus between

03:05:58.020 --> 03:06:04.520
them and 3 squared is 9. Over, we've got the x minus 8 times the square root of x plus

03:06:04.520 --> 03:06:11.520
1 plus 3. Clean up a bit to combine like terms in the numerator. We've got the limit as x

03:06:13.000 --> 03:06:20.000
approaches 8 of x minus 8 over x minus 8 times the square root of x plus 1 plus 3, and that's

03:06:24.800 --> 03:06:31.300
nice because the x minus 8s divide out. Always remember when we divide out everything, there's

03:06:31.300 --> 03:06:37.260
still a 1 in the numerator, and what's really nice is we've removed that discontinuity. So

03:06:37.260 --> 03:06:44.260
we're ready to plug that 8 into x. We've got 1 over the square root of 8 plus 1 plus 3.

03:06:46.140 --> 03:06:53.140
8 plus 1 is 9, the square root of 9 is 3, plus 3 is 6. We seem to be getting a slope

03:06:54.140 --> 03:07:01.140
of 1 sixth at x equals 8. Now just to practice the other definition as well, we've got the

03:07:07.980 --> 03:07:14.980
limit as h approaches 0 of f of a plus h minus f of a all over h. I like writing it every

03:07:15.980 --> 03:07:20.980
time until you get this ingrained in your head. It's an important formula to know for

03:07:20.980 --> 03:07:27.980
the rest of this unit and beyond. So we've got the limit as h goes to 0 of f of a. This

03:07:30.540 --> 03:07:37.540
time a is 8, so we're going to plug 8 plus h into the x, the square root of 8 plus h,

03:07:38.540 --> 03:07:45.540
and there's a plus 1 minus f of a. We've already calculated that to be 3 all over h. Same strategy

03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:57.260
from here. We're going to get rid of the radical by multiplying by the conjugate, which is

03:07:57.260 --> 03:08:03.620
the square root of, let's go ahead and combine the light terms. 8 plus 1 is 9 plus h. We're

03:08:03.620 --> 03:08:10.620
going to make it a plus 3, square root of 9 plus h plus 3, and when we do that, let's

03:08:12.780 --> 03:08:19.780
go on to the next line. We've got the limit as h goes to 0 of square the square root.

03:08:20.100 --> 03:08:27.100
We get 9 plus h, negative 3 plus 3 is negative 9 over h times the square root of 9 plus h

03:08:27.100 --> 03:08:34.100
plus 3, which is really nice because 9 minus 9 is 0 and that leaves us with the limit as

03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:45.500
h goes to 0 of h over h times the square root of 9 plus h plus 3. Reduce out the h's, remembering

03:08:45.500 --> 03:08:52.500
that leaves us with 1, but what's important there is we have removed our discontinuity,

03:08:58.140 --> 03:09:05.140
so we're ready to plug 0 in for h. We've got 1 over the square root of 9 plus 0 plus 3,

03:09:06.260 --> 03:09:13.260
which is 1 over 9 plus 0 is 9, the square root of 9 is 3, plus 3 is 6, and we get the

03:09:14.020 --> 03:09:21.020
exact same slope. We are ready to write the equation of our tangent line at 8 is y equals

03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:35.700
m, the slope of 1 sixth times x minus the x coordinate of 8 plus the y coordinate of

03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:43.100
3, y equals 1 sixth times x minus 8 plus 3. That's how we can find the equation of the

03:09:51.620 --> 03:09:56.140
tangent line at a point. We can use one of these two formulas. I believe the homework

03:09:56.140 --> 03:10:00.580
assignment tells you which formula to use for a given problem, so you get practice using

03:10:00.580 --> 03:10:07.060
both formulas with similar types of problems. But once you find the slope of the tangent

03:10:07.060 --> 03:10:11.180
line from one of those points, we just plug it into our equation formula. Take a look at

03:10:11.180 --> 03:10:18.180
some problems and we will see you in class. In our previous lesson, we talked about how

03:10:19.300 --> 03:10:24.860
we could find the derivative at a specific point, but today we're going to extend that

03:10:24.860 --> 03:10:31.860
discussion and answer the question of how can we calculate the derivative at every point?

03:10:31.860 --> 03:10:38.860
So, to set this up, we are going to expand our definition of the derivative to, instead

03:10:55.540 --> 03:10:58.940
of just calculating the slope of the tangent line at a specific point, we're going to

03:10:59.020 --> 03:11:06.020
start to look at the derivative as a function. And specifically, that function is going to

03:11:11.860 --> 03:11:17.300
be written as f with a little mark that we call prime, f prime of x. That means it's

03:11:17.300 --> 03:11:24.300
the derivative of f at x. f prime of x is equal to the limit as h goes to 0. And we're

03:11:25.300 --> 03:11:31.820
going to take that second definition of a derivative and kind of generalize it to f

03:11:31.820 --> 03:11:38.820
of x plus h minus f of x all over h. And this is going to be our equation to calculate

03:11:43.420 --> 03:11:50.420
the derivative as a function for all points x. So, if we can just calculate this thing,

03:11:50.860 --> 03:11:57.860
we just have to plug in the x value to get the actual derivative at any point we're interested

03:11:57.860 --> 03:12:04.860
in. So, let's see if we can actually use this formula to find the derivative of, let's start

03:12:04.980 --> 03:12:11.980
with f of x equals x squared minus 4x plus 1. So, to calculate the derivative f prime

03:12:12.980 --> 03:12:19.980
of x, we're going to replace each of the x's with the x plus h. So, x plus h, it becomes

03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:31.940
x plus h squared. Oops, forgot the limit part. Don't forget the limit part, that's important.

03:12:31.940 --> 03:12:38.940
Limit as h goes to 0 of x plus h squared minus 4 times x, which is now x plus h, plus 1,

03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:49.140
and then the derivative function says subtract the entire function f of x. It's very important

03:12:49.140 --> 03:12:54.100
when you do this, you put the function in parentheses because otherwise we're going

03:12:54.100 --> 03:13:01.100
to run into a sin air. We're not just subtracting the first term. Now, we want to make sure

03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:07.980
we subtract the entire thing. That negative is going to ultimately, in our next step,

03:13:07.980 --> 03:13:14.700
compute through that parentheses onto the entire polynomial there. We'll get there in

03:13:14.700 --> 03:13:21.700
a minute, but don't forget to put the function in parentheses, and it's all over h. So, cleaning

03:13:23.900 --> 03:13:30.900
this up then, we're going to end up with the limit as h goes to 0 of, and when we square,

03:13:31.500 --> 03:13:38.500
we get x squared plus 2xh plus h squared. Distribute the negative 4 through, we get

03:13:39.100 --> 03:13:46.100
negative 4x minus 4h, plus a 1. Then distributing the negative through, we get negative x squared,

03:13:48.260 --> 03:13:54.460
positive 4x and a negative 1, distributing that negative all the way through, all over

03:13:54.460 --> 03:14:01.460
h. But what's nice now is this is as ugly as it gets because you'll start to see lots

03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:06.260
of things are going to disappear. We've got x squared and a negative x squared. Those

03:14:06.260 --> 03:14:13.260
go to 0. We've got a negative 4x and a positive 4x. Those go to 0. We've got a positive 1

03:14:14.780 --> 03:14:21.380
and a negative 1. Those go to 0. So, when we clean up, we just have left the limit as

03:14:21.380 --> 03:14:28.380
h goes to 0 of 2xh plus h squared, minus 4h, all over h. We want to remove the discontinuity

03:14:35.280 --> 03:14:42.440
at h, and it's nice because we can factor out in h. So, we have the limit as h goes

03:14:42.440 --> 03:14:49.440
to 0 of h times 2x plus h minus 4, all over h. And now, we're going to get a negative

03:14:52.160 --> 03:14:59.160
we divide out the h's. We've removed the discontinuity so we can replace h with what it's approaching,

03:14:59.880 --> 03:15:06.880
0, 2x plus 0 minus 4, or just 2x minus 4, is the equation for the derivative of the tangent

03:15:13.140 --> 03:15:20.140
line of x squared minus 4x plus 1. Now, if we wanted to know the derivative at any value

03:15:22.100 --> 03:15:25.640
we just plug in that number. If we want to know what the derivative is when x equals

03:15:25.640 --> 03:15:31.440
0, plug 0 in, we get negative 4. If we want to know what the derivative is at 10, we

03:15:31.440 --> 03:15:37.640
plug 10 in, we get 20 minus 4, which is 16. And it's really quick to calculate the derivative

03:15:37.640 --> 03:15:44.640
now that we have a function to describe it. Let's try one more example. Let's take f of

03:15:45.420 --> 03:15:52.420
x is equal to the square root of 2x plus 1 and see if we can calculate her derivative.

03:15:59.460 --> 03:16:04.940
So to calculate the derivative, f prime of x, it's equal to the limit as h approaches

03:16:04.940 --> 03:16:11.940
0 of f of x plus h. We're going to replace the x with x plus h. That gives us the square

03:16:12.940 --> 03:16:19.940
root of 2 times x plus h plus 1 minus the function itself, which is the square root

03:16:20.540 --> 03:16:27.540
of 2x plus 1, all over the h. Well, we've seen square roots before. We know to get rid

03:16:29.860 --> 03:16:34.300
of them. We multiply by the conjugate. So we have the square root of, and I'm going

03:16:34.300 --> 03:16:41.300
to go ahead and distribute just to save us the work, 2x plus 2h plus 1. We use plus

03:16:42.180 --> 03:16:49.180
the opposite sign, the square root of 2x plus 1, and do the same thing in the denominator.

03:16:49.220 --> 03:16:56.220
2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1. When we do that, we have the limit

03:16:59.140 --> 03:17:04.420
as h goes to 0. We square the square roots. They're gone. We've got a minus in between

03:17:04.420 --> 03:17:11.420
them. So we have 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus 2h plus 1 plus 2h plus 2h plus 1 plus 2h plus

03:17:12.700 --> 03:17:19.300
minus between them. Don't forget the minus between them. Minus, and I'm going to go ahead

03:17:19.300 --> 03:17:23.860
and distribute that negative onto both parts. Make sure it goes onto both parts. Negative

03:17:23.860 --> 03:17:30.860
2x minus 1 all over h times, and we'll leave this factor because we want to be able to

03:17:31.180 --> 03:17:38.180
reduce the square root of 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1. And then

03:17:42.460 --> 03:17:49.460
things become nice for us. 2x minus 2x is 0. 1 minus 1 is 0. And so we just have the

03:17:52.260 --> 03:17:59.260
limit as h goes to 0 of 2h over h times the square root of 2x plus 2h plus 1 plus the

03:18:03.100 --> 03:18:10.100
square root of 2x plus 1. And ultimately those h's divide out and we have removed the

03:18:12.700 --> 03:18:19.700
discontinuity. Now we're ready to plug in what we know. h is 0. So we have 2 over the square

03:18:23.900 --> 03:18:30.900
root of 2x plus 2 times 0 plus 1 plus the square root of 2x plus 1. What's nice is that

03:18:30.900 --> 03:18:37.900
square root of 2x plus 1, what's nice is that 2 times 0 is actually equal to 0. So we have

03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:47.100
matching radicals in the denominator. 2x plus 1 times 2x plus 1. So we've got 2 of those.

03:18:49.560 --> 03:18:56.560
So we have 2 over 2 square roots of 2x plus 1. And actually we can reduce out the 2's.

03:19:00.900 --> 03:19:07.900
Which is going to leave behind a 1. So for our final function 1 over the square root

03:19:08.340 --> 03:19:15.340
of 2x plus 1. So now that we know kind of how to calculate derivatives, and there will

03:19:18.660 --> 03:19:23.220
be a lot to practice on the assignment and in class, I want to talk a little bit about

03:19:23.220 --> 03:19:29.100
how the derivative is connected to the graph of the function. We're going to see if we

03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:36.100
can sketch a graph of a derivative. Because remember the derivative describes the slope

03:19:44.140 --> 03:19:51.140
or the rate of change of the tangent line. In fact, let's write that down. The derivative

03:19:51.580 --> 03:19:58.580
is the slope of the tangent line. So if the graph is increasing, if the graph is going

03:19:58.580 --> 03:20:05.580
uphill, then it's got a positive slope. Because the slope is going uphill. So if we're going

03:20:29.020 --> 03:20:36.020
in other words, f prime of x has to be greater than zero. That means the graph must be going

03:20:38.180 --> 03:20:45.180
uphill somehow. You see it's going uphill from left to right. It's got a positive slope.

03:20:48.060 --> 03:20:55.060
If the slope, or if the graph, is decreasing, the graph is going downhill, and the graph

03:20:58.860 --> 03:21:05.860
the tangent line will also go downhill. So the slope of the tangent line is negative.

03:21:07.060 --> 03:21:13.860
In other words, the derivative f prime of x is negative. It's less than zero. The graph

03:21:13.860 --> 03:21:20.860
is going downhill. So the graph of the tangent line is also negative, showing the downhill

03:21:21.860 --> 03:21:28.340
slope. I guess we could also say the neutral statement, that if the graph hits a flat

03:21:28.420 --> 03:21:35.420
point, the graph is flat, then we could say the slope is zero. In other words, we would

03:21:42.340 --> 03:21:49.060
say f prime of x is equal to zero. That could happen a couple of ways. It could be going

03:21:49.060 --> 03:21:54.940
up and level out. So there's your slope zero right on top. It could be going down and

03:21:54.940 --> 03:22:00.900
leveling out. So your slope is zero down there on the bottom. It's completely flat. Or it

03:22:00.900 --> 03:22:06.460
could make a trough where it comes up, levels out, and keeps going up, or keeps going down.

03:22:06.460 --> 03:22:11.180
But you notice right in the middle there, the tangent line does level out as it changes

03:22:11.180 --> 03:22:15.580
direction.

03:22:15.580 --> 03:22:30.220
So what this looks like then on a graph is, for an example, as if I have a function here,

03:22:30.220 --> 03:22:44.220
we'll call this f of x. And let's see, we're going to put a point on the graph at, let's

03:22:44.820 --> 03:22:51.820
give it some height, two. We'll put a point on this graph at negative three, negative

03:22:51.820 --> 03:23:06.820
two. And another point at negative one, comma two. Then a point at two, comma negative two.

03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:12.500
And then we'll connect it by coming in from the top, hitting the first point and going

03:23:12.500 --> 03:23:16.860
up, hitting the second point and going down. And we're going to make a trough where we

03:23:16.860 --> 03:23:23.360
level out and keep going down at the third point. Let me see if I can make that a little

03:23:23.360 --> 03:23:30.860
better here. Down, maximum, level off. There we go. Maybe. We'll call that good enough.

03:23:30.860 --> 03:23:37.860
In order to draw a graph of the derivative of this function, a graph of f prime of x,

03:23:39.860 --> 03:23:46.860
what we'll do is we'll kind of make some observations about this graph. The first observation that's

03:23:47.980 --> 03:23:54.980
going to be helpful to us is, identify a graph of f prime of x. What we'll do is we'll kind

03:23:54.980 --> 03:23:59.820
of make some observations about this graph. The first observation that's going to be helpful

03:23:59.820 --> 03:24:06.820
to us is identifying where the tangent line is completely flat. Because at all of those

03:24:07.460 --> 03:24:14.460
points where the tangent line is flat, we know the slope is equal to zero. Which means

03:24:15.540 --> 03:24:22.340
we've got a zero on our graph at each of those points. So the slope is zero here at negative

03:24:22.340 --> 03:24:29.340
three. At negative three there's a zero. At negative one the slope is zero. And at positive

03:24:32.740 --> 03:24:38.940
two the slope is zero. That's where we've got our x intercepts of zero. Because the

03:24:38.940 --> 03:24:45.940
graph is describing the slope. The next thing I notice is the graph starts going downhill.

03:24:46.940 --> 03:24:53.940
The slope is negative. So we need to start negative on our graph until we hit that point.

03:24:56.380 --> 03:25:01.980
After that the graph starts going uphill. It's increasing. The slope is positive until

03:25:01.980 --> 03:25:08.180
the next zero. So we need to make sure our graph is positive until we hit the next zero.

03:25:08.180 --> 03:25:14.100
Notice the green line is now all above the x axis positive to the next zero. Then we're

03:25:14.100 --> 03:25:20.540
decreasing to the next zero. So we're going to be negative. We need to be negative to

03:25:20.540 --> 03:25:27.540
the next zero. But afterwards it's still decreasing. Which means after the next zero

03:25:28.860 --> 03:25:35.860
we still need to be decreasing. We still need to be negative. So the graph starts negative,

03:25:36.740 --> 03:25:43.740
turns positive, turns negative, and then stays negative. And so we've sketched approximately

03:25:44.420 --> 03:25:50.500
not exactly but pretty close to what the derivative of this first function looks like. Because

03:25:50.500 --> 03:25:57.500
we know that if the graph is increasing the derivative is positive. If the graph is decreasing

03:25:57.860 --> 03:26:04.860
the derivative is negative. And if the graph is flat the derivative is zero. I have one

03:26:07.540 --> 03:26:12.100
more extension I want to put onto this lesson. And it's really just more of the same of

03:26:12.100 --> 03:26:18.460
what we saw at the beginning along with a little bit of notation. And it's this idea

03:26:18.460 --> 03:26:25.460
of what we call higher ordered derivatives. And the idea here is if we take a function

03:26:33.620 --> 03:26:39.740
and we can find its derivative, which is also a function, we should be able to take its

03:26:39.820 --> 03:26:45.500
derivative to get another function. And then take its derivative to get another function

03:26:45.500 --> 03:26:52.500
and just keep taking derivatives of derivatives. Derivatives of derivatives. And to set this

03:26:59.140 --> 03:27:05.740
up I want to talk a little bit about notation and one of the challenges of calculus that

03:27:05.740 --> 03:27:12.500
came out of it. Calculus was developed simultaneously by both Newton who gets all the credit and

03:27:12.500 --> 03:27:17.700
Leibniz, I'm probably pronouncing his name wrong, but both of them used a different notation

03:27:17.700 --> 03:27:24.380
for how to express the derivative. And so as a result we have two different notations

03:27:24.380 --> 03:27:31.380
for how to express the derivative. Newton used f of x and his compadre used y. And so

03:27:32.380 --> 03:27:37.900
when we're talking about the first derivative, the derivative that we just take, Newton would

03:27:37.900 --> 03:27:44.900
just put a prime on it. So we'd see f prime of x to represent the first derivative. Alternatively

03:27:45.780 --> 03:27:52.780
with just the y we could call that dy dx, which is the derivative of y with respect

03:27:53.580 --> 03:28:00.580
to x. What the variable is that we're working with. The second derivative then, the derivative

03:28:01.500 --> 03:28:06.620
of the derivative, with f of x notation we just do a double prime to show the derivative

03:28:06.620 --> 03:28:13.500
has been taken twice. However with the dy dx notation we say we take the derivatives

03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:20.500
twice of y with respect to x twice. And so we get d2y over dx2. And then we kind of

03:28:23.520 --> 03:28:28.660
extend that to the third, fourth, fifth, and beyond derivatives where you'll see three

03:28:28.660 --> 03:28:34.620
primes to represent the third derivative. And then it's d3y for the third derivative

03:28:34.620 --> 03:28:41.620
of y with respect to x three times. So that's kind of the notation you might see. But really

03:28:42.540 --> 03:28:49.540
it just means take the same formula for the same idea. In other words the derivative of

03:28:49.540 --> 03:28:56.540
the derivative, or f prime prime of x, is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of f prime

03:28:57.540 --> 03:29:04.540
of x plus h minus f prime of x all over h. In fact I'm not even going to mark this as

03:29:06.020 --> 03:29:13.020
a key formula because it's the exact same derivative formula. This time we're just working with

03:29:13.020 --> 03:29:20.020
the derivative to calculate the second derivative. Let's do an example where we can see that

03:29:20.020 --> 03:29:29.020
worked out. We're going to find the second derivative of 3x squared minus 3x squared minus 3x squared.

03:29:43.020 --> 03:29:50.020
Minus 4x plus 1. Well in order to find the second derivative we first have to know what

03:29:52.380 --> 03:29:58.060
the first derivative is. So let's find the first derivative f prime of x is equal to

03:29:58.060 --> 03:30:05.060
the limit as h goes to zero of f of x plus h. I'm going to replace the x's with x plus

03:30:05.060 --> 03:30:12.060
h. 3 times x plus h squared minus 4 times x plus h plus 1 minus the f of x which we're

03:30:20.500 --> 03:30:25.700
going to put in parentheses so we don't forget to distribute the negative through minus 3x

03:30:25.700 --> 03:30:32.700
squared minus 4x plus 1 all over h. Which is equal to the limit as h goes to zero of

03:30:35.060 --> 03:30:42.060
with this first part we have to square the x plus h and then distribute a 3 through. So

03:30:42.060 --> 03:30:49.060
I'm just going to square it off to the side here. x squared plus 2xh plus h squared. And

03:30:49.060 --> 03:30:56.060
then I'll distribute the 3 into that. So we have 3x squared plus 6xh plus 3h squared.

03:30:56.380 --> 03:31:03.380
Distribute the negative to get negative 4x minus 4h plus 1. Distribute the negative through

03:31:12.780 --> 03:31:19.780
to get negative 3x squared plus 4x minus 1 all over h. Hopefully we can clean this up

03:31:20.020 --> 03:31:27.020
a bit. 3x squared minus 3x squared is 0. Negative 4x plus 4x is 0. 1 minus 1 is 0. And so we

03:31:41.860 --> 03:31:48.860
have the limit as h goes to zero of 6xh plus 3h squared. And so we have the limit as h

03:31:49.780 --> 03:31:56.780
squared minus 4h all over h. And we remove that discontinuity by factoring out the h.

03:32:02.860 --> 03:32:09.860
Times 6x plus 3h minus 4 all over the h. The h is divided out and now we can just plug

03:32:10.860 --> 03:32:17.860
in the 0. So we have 6x plus 3 times 0 minus 4 which is equal to just 6x minus 4. But that

03:32:29.100 --> 03:32:36.100
is just the first derivative. This problem wanted us to find the second derivative. So

03:32:36.540 --> 03:32:43.540
using our new function we take the derivative again. f prime prime of x is equal to the

03:32:47.340 --> 03:32:54.340
limit as h goes to 0 of f of x plus h. We are going to replace the x with x plus h. So

03:32:54.660 --> 03:33:01.660
we have 6 times x plus h minus 4. Subtract the function or subtract the 6x minus 4 and

03:33:02.660 --> 03:33:09.660
put it all over h. Distributing through we get the limit as h goes to 0 of 6x plus 6h

03:33:15.380 --> 03:33:22.380
minus 4 minus 6x plus 4. Distributing that negative through all over h. Fortunately we

03:33:23.380 --> 03:33:30.380
can subtract some things out. 6 minus 6x is 0. Negative 4 plus 4 is 0. And so we have

03:33:36.220 --> 03:33:43.220
the limit as h goes to 0 of 6h over h. Which is really nice because the h is divided out.

03:33:44.220 --> 03:33:51.220
And we are just left with a single simple number 6 as our second derivative of 3x squared

03:33:56.340 --> 03:34:03.340
minus 4x plus 1. If I wanted to find the third derivative we would just run through the formula

03:34:03.980 --> 03:34:10.020
again. But ultimately with this lesson today the important key thing is that you know the

03:34:10.020 --> 03:34:17.020
function for the derivative is the limit as h goes to 0 of f of x plus h minus f of x

03:34:19.260 --> 03:34:25.260
all over h. Try a few and practice this. We will take a look at it more in class and we

03:34:25.260 --> 03:34:31.260
will see you then. Now that we have gotten comfortable with the definition of the derivative

03:34:31.260 --> 03:34:37.540
the common frustration is how tedious that formula is. So the question that starts to

03:34:37.540 --> 03:34:44.540
come up is what are some derivative shortcuts so that we don't have to go through that formula

03:34:53.620 --> 03:35:00.620
every time. And you can imagine as a function becomes very complicated the derivative function

03:35:00.880 --> 03:35:06.500
could become very tedious to work through. Well there is lots of derivative shortcuts

03:35:06.500 --> 03:35:10.260
we are going to look at over the next several lessons. We are going to look today at four

03:35:10.260 --> 03:35:17.260
basic shortcuts. And then after that we will take a look at two important shortcuts that

03:35:22.580 --> 03:35:29.580
are a little bit more involved. The most basic is the constant shortcut. And the idea of

03:35:29.820 --> 03:35:36.820
the constant shortcut is if we take the derivative d dx is the alternative notation for a derivative

03:35:39.740 --> 03:35:46.740
the derivative of some constant or some number we are going to always get 0 for our answer

03:35:47.740 --> 03:35:54.740
because if a constant is a straight line the derivative of a straight flat line is 0. So

03:35:54.740 --> 03:36:01.740
for example if I wanted to calculate the derivative of 5 a constant well that is just going to

03:36:07.060 --> 03:36:14.060
be 0 because 5 is not changing it has a slope of 0. The second basic shortcut is the power

03:36:14.460 --> 03:36:21.460
rule and this is probably the one we will use the most. And the idea is if we are taking

03:36:21.460 --> 03:36:28.460
the derivative of x raised to some exponent. When we have x raised to some exponent we

03:36:31.580 --> 03:36:38.580
will pull that exponent out in front and then we will reduce the exponent by 1. And this

03:36:39.580 --> 03:36:46.580
is probably the most used derivative shortcut. With polynomials we pull the exponent out

03:36:48.340 --> 03:36:55.340
front and then decrease the exponent by 1. So for example if I wanted the derivative

03:36:55.340 --> 03:37:02.340
of x to the 7th power all I have to do is I move that 7th power out front and then I

03:37:03.340 --> 03:37:10.340
reduce the exponent by 1 and we get 7x to the 6th. A third rule I am going to call it

03:37:16.820 --> 03:37:21.740
the sum rule it is often called the difference rule as well because it works with plus or

03:37:21.740 --> 03:37:28.740
minus and the idea is if I take the derivative of some function plus or minus another function

03:37:29.740 --> 03:37:36.740
where I know the derivative of the individual pieces all I have to do is take the derivative

03:37:37.420 --> 03:37:44.420
of the individual pieces and it is f prime plus g prime of x. So for example combining

03:37:49.140 --> 03:37:54.980
the power rule and the sum rule together it should be plus or minus. If I wanted the

03:37:54.980 --> 03:38:01.980
derivative of x to the 5th minus x squared plus x plus 2 we just take the derivatives

03:38:07.120 --> 03:38:12.460
of the individual pieces. The power rule says we move the exponent out front and subtract

03:38:12.460 --> 03:38:18.960
1. So we get 5x to the 4th minus x squared bring the 2 out front, subtract 1 from the

03:38:18.960 --> 03:38:25.840
exponent we just have x plus with x that is really x to the 1st so we pull the 1 out

03:38:25.840 --> 03:38:32.840
front and drop it by 1 so x to the 0 is just 1 and then the derivative of 2 a constant

03:38:33.480 --> 03:38:40.480
is just 0 so all that we are left with is the 5x to the 4th minus 2x plus 1. The final

03:38:40.480 --> 03:38:47.480
basic shortcut is the constant multiplier which says if I am taking the derivative of

03:38:47.480 --> 03:38:54.480
some constant times a function we keep that constant in front and multiply it by the derivative

03:38:56.040 --> 03:39:03.040
of that constant and then we multiply it by the derivative of that constant and then we

03:39:10.480 --> 03:39:17.480
get the inside function and that is the 4th basic shortcut. So for example if I wanted

03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:33.000
the derivative now of 3x to the 5th minus 2x to the 4th plus 5x squared minus 7x plus

03:39:34.000 --> 03:39:41.000
1. Let's get us a little more white board space so we can put it right underneath it.

03:39:46.200 --> 03:39:52.560
The 3 can just be multiplied by whatever the derivative is of x to the 5th. Well we know

03:39:52.560 --> 03:39:59.560
we pulled that exponent out front so 3 times 5 is 15, x to the 1 less 4th power minus bringing

03:40:00.560 --> 03:40:07.560
the exponent out front 2 times 4 is 8, x cubed shrinking the exponent by 1 plus 2 times 5

03:40:09.920 --> 03:40:16.920
is 10, x shrinking the exponent by 1 minus 7 times 1 is 7. Shrink the exponent by 1 and

03:40:18.560 --> 03:40:24.200
the x disappears and the derivative of the constant is 0 so now we have our new derivative

03:40:24.200 --> 03:40:31.200
of that polynomial. These 4 basic rules of differentiation will save us a lot of work

03:40:33.320 --> 03:40:40.320
and time on that derivative formula. Now in fact we should be able to quite quickly find

03:40:40.320 --> 03:40:47.320
the equation of the tangent line to f of x equals 4x cubed minus 2x squared plus 2x squared

03:41:10.320 --> 03:41:17.320
plus 5x minus 1 at x equals negative 1. Well first we need to know what the y coordinate

03:41:21.520 --> 03:41:27.920
is that we're going to end up with. Actually no, first let's actually find the derivative

03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:34.920
at 1. So first we're going to take the derivative f prime of x is equal to 4 times 3 is 12,

03:41:35.920 --> 03:41:42.920
x squared subtract 1 from the exponent minus 2 times 2 is 4, x plus 5 and the x disappears.

03:41:49.920 --> 03:41:55.520
We want it at specifically x equals negative 1 so we'll do f prime of negative 1 which

03:41:55.520 --> 03:42:02.520
is 12 times negative 1 squared minus 4 times negative 1 plus 5 and if we work that out

03:42:03.520 --> 03:42:10.520
it becomes 12 plus 4 plus 5 is 21. So the slope we now know is 21. We do need to know

03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:31.520
the y coordinate of this point when x is 1 what is y equal? So we do need to plug the

03:42:31.520 --> 03:42:38.520
negative 1 into the original function as well. f of negative 1 is equal to 4 times negative

03:42:38.520 --> 03:42:45.520
1 cubed minus 2 times negative 1 squared plus 5 times negative 1 minus 1. So our y coordinate

03:42:47.600 --> 03:42:54.600
is equal to negative 4 plus 2 minus 5 minus 1 which gives us negative 12. So we're going

03:43:02.200 --> 03:43:09.200
to take the derivative at 1 minus 12. So for the equation of our line, y equals the slope

03:43:10.400 --> 03:43:17.400
we found out was 21 times x minus x1 minus negative 1 is plus 1 minus 12 and our line

03:43:22.200 --> 03:43:29.200
tangent to our function is 21 times x plus 1 minus 12. So those are our basic equations

03:43:32.520 --> 03:43:37.560
to help with differentiation. The next two are a little more involved and they take a

03:43:37.560 --> 03:43:43.320
bit of practice to get used to using. We'll see a lot of errors with this one particularly

03:43:43.320 --> 03:43:50.320
which is the product rule. The product rule says that the derivative of two pieces that

03:43:54.120 --> 03:44:00.720
are multiplied by each other f of x times g of x. The common error I see is people just

03:44:00.920 --> 03:44:06.720
take the derivative of both and multiply and they say f prime times g prime. That is incorrect

03:44:06.720 --> 03:44:13.400
and it does not work. What we actually do is the derivative of the first part times the

03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:20.400
second part plus the derivative of the second part times the first part. So there's two

03:44:24.480 --> 03:44:29.400
parts to it and we take the derivative of the first part in the first part and the derivative

03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:36.400
of the second part in the second part. So for example if I wanted to take the derivative

03:44:37.360 --> 03:44:44.360
of 3x squared minus 5x plus 1 times 2x squared plus 4x minus 7 we've got two individual parts.

03:44:44.640 --> 03:44:51.640
So the formula says we take the derivative of the first part. The first part, the 3x

03:45:00.520 --> 03:45:04.280
squared, let's color code these. We'll do the first part in blue and the second part

03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:09.000
in green just so we can see how this works out. So in blue the derivative of the first

03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:16.000
part is 6x minus 5. Then that is multiplied by the second part 2x squared plus 4x minus

03:45:19.840 --> 03:45:26.840
7. Plus then we take the derivative of the second part. The derivative of the second

03:45:30.880 --> 03:45:37.880
part is 4x plus 4 times the second part. 3x squared plus 4x plus 4 times the second part

03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:46.000
of 5x squared minus 5x plus 1. And this then as ugly as it looks is the correct answer

03:45:49.120 --> 03:45:56.120
for the derivative of that product. The derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative

03:45:58.920 --> 03:46:05.920
of the second times the first. Let's look at one more. Let's do the derivative of 5 over

03:46:06.360 --> 03:46:13.360
x squared plus 3 over x times 2x cubed minus 7. Whoa, we don't really have a derivative

03:46:21.720 --> 03:46:27.480
trick for x as being in the denominator. Actually we do. We just need to tweak this

03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:32.960
problem a little bit and rewrite it as the derivative of and think about what type of

03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:40.040
exponent sticks things in the denominator. Well a negative exponent does that. This is

03:46:40.040 --> 03:46:47.040
really 5x to the negative 2 plus 3x to the negative 1 times the 2x cubed minus 7. So

03:46:52.120 --> 03:46:59.120
again now we are multiplying two polynomials. A first part times the second part. And the

03:46:59.720 --> 03:47:06.720
formula says it's equal to the derivative of the first. 5 times negative 2 is negative

03:47:06.720 --> 03:47:13.720
10x. And if we subtract 1 from negative 2 the new exponent is negative 3. 3 times negative

03:47:14.960 --> 03:47:21.960
1 is negative 3x. Subtract 1 from the exponent and we get negative 2. The derivative of the

03:47:21.960 --> 03:47:28.960
first times the second 2x cubed minus 7 plus the derivative of the second 2 times 3 is

03:47:36.480 --> 03:47:43.480
6x squared and the negative 7 is a constant so there is nothing there. Times the first

03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:51.480
5x to the negative 1. I'm sorry 5x to the negative 2 plus 3x to the negative 1. And

03:47:56.400 --> 03:48:03.400
this then is the derivative of that product. That is the product rule. Similar to the product

03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:10.400
rule is what we are going to call the quotient rule. And I should probably label this as C. The quotient

03:48:20.360 --> 03:48:27.360
rule. And it's got two tweaks to make it different. But it's very similar. If I'm taking the

03:48:27.520 --> 03:48:34.520
derivative of two things that are divided. F of x divided by g of x. Be careful this is

03:48:35.080 --> 03:48:42.080
not f prime divided by g prime. We can't just divide the derivatives. Instead we will take

03:48:44.000 --> 03:48:51.000
the derivative of the first times the second. And because this is division we will actually

03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:58.000
subtract the derivative of the second times the first. And the big difference here is

03:48:58.720 --> 03:49:05.720
we have to divide by the denominator squared. Which is kind of interesting. We end up with

03:49:06.840 --> 03:49:13.840
the square denominator in the denominator. So for example if I'm being asked to find

03:49:14.480 --> 03:49:21.480
the derivative of 4x squared minus 5x plus 1. Over x squared minus 7. We've got a top

03:49:25.240 --> 03:49:32.240
piece. And we've got a bottom piece. Keeping track of that then we take the derivative

03:49:34.440 --> 03:49:41.440
of the first piece. 4 times 2 is 8x minus 5. Times the denominator just like it is.

03:49:44.400 --> 03:49:51.400
x squared minus 7. Then we subtract the derivative of the denominator. x squared becomes 2x.

03:49:57.240 --> 03:50:04.240
Times the numerator which is 4x squared minus 5x plus 1. And then in the denominator we

03:50:05.180 --> 03:50:12.180
take the old denominator. x squared minus 7. And we square it. To get our final result

03:50:13.840 --> 03:50:20.840
we take the final big ugly but correct derivative. This formula takes a little bit of practice

03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:30.360
to get really comfortable with. But it certainly is much nicer than doing it with the derivative

03:50:30.360 --> 03:50:36.360
formula. Let's do another one. Let's take the derivative of the square root of x over

03:50:36.360 --> 03:50:43.360
2x cubed minus 7 over x. We get the derivative of the derivative of the square root of x

03:50:43.960 --> 03:50:50.960
one thing you might notice right away is that we need to rewrite that so it's that friendly

03:50:51.880 --> 03:50:58.880
polynomial so we can use our exponent trick. So we're going to actually find the derivative.

03:50:58.880 --> 03:51:05.880
Square root is really just a one half power over 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one

03:51:06.880 --> 03:51:13.880
which is what moved that x into the denominator. Now we have a clear numerator and denominator

03:51:16.160 --> 03:51:23.160
to use in our formula. We take the derivative of the first one. Pull the exponent out front.

03:51:25.080 --> 03:51:32.080
x subtract one from one half. One half minus one is negative one half. Times the denominator

03:51:32.360 --> 03:51:39.360
which is 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one. Subtract and then we take the derivative

03:51:45.360 --> 03:51:51.720
of the denominator. Two times three is six x squared. Negative seven times negative one

03:51:51.720 --> 03:51:58.720
is positive seven x to the now negative two times the first function which is x to the

03:51:58.720 --> 03:52:05.720
one half. And this is all over that denominator 2x cubed minus 7x to the negative one squared.

03:52:13.320 --> 03:52:20.320
And we now have the derivative of our quotient. And we now have the derivative of our quotient

03:52:29.720 --> 03:52:34.040
Now that we have a couple derivative rules we can actually take a look at some applications

03:52:34.040 --> 03:52:40.280
of the derivative and solve some more interesting problems. And one of the most common applications

03:52:40.280 --> 03:52:47.280
of the derivative is the relationship between the position of an object, the velocity of

03:52:48.120 --> 03:52:55.120
that object, and that object's acceleration. All three of these things are connected by

03:53:09.360 --> 03:53:16.360
derivatives because the derivative is the rate of change. And so the velocity does not

03:53:17.680 --> 03:53:21.880
describe how the position is changing. The acceleration describes how the velocity is

03:53:21.880 --> 03:53:28.880
changing. So these three variables or functions really we can make for each of them. The position

03:53:34.320 --> 03:53:41.320
describes where the object is at time t. And we will use the derivative of the derivative

03:53:47.280 --> 03:53:54.280
to use the function s of t to represent the object's position at a given moment of time.

03:53:54.840 --> 03:54:01.840
But it's moving. And so to describe the speed or rate at which it's moving we have the velocity.

03:54:03.880 --> 03:54:10.880
Which the velocity can be thought of as speed, but speed doesn't really have a direction.

03:54:11.240 --> 03:54:16.000
Velocity does have a direction. Positive, generally meaning to the right. Negative, generally meaning

03:54:16.000 --> 03:54:23.000
to the left. So speed with direction. Or the rate of change at which the position is

03:54:24.280 --> 03:54:31.280
changing. So the change in position. So we will use v of t to represent the velocity

03:54:36.240 --> 03:54:41.040
at a specific point in time. But because it's the change in position we say that it's

03:54:41.040 --> 03:54:48.040
the derivative of the position. Finally we have the acceleration. Or how fast the velocity

03:54:55.920 --> 03:55:02.920
is changing. The change in velocity. And we use a of t to represent the acceleration.

03:55:03.920 --> 03:55:10.760
And we use a of t to represent the acceleration. And because that's describing the change in

03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:17.760
velocity that's the derivative of the velocity. Or the second derivative of the position.

03:55:20.420 --> 03:55:25.200
So knowing that we have this relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration

03:55:25.200 --> 03:55:32.200
all connected by the derivative we can solve problems in relationship to these three questions.

03:55:32.920 --> 03:55:40.800
So for example if the position of an object in feet after t seconds is given by s of t

03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:10.920
is equal to t cubed divided by 5 minus 3 over t squared. What is its velocity and acceleration?

03:56:33.800 --> 03:56:40.800
After two seconds. First thing I'm going to do with this function is I'm going to change

03:56:53.200 --> 03:56:58.040
it to be a nicer polynomial because I don't like having the, or a nicer rational expression.

03:56:58.040 --> 03:57:02.200
I don't like having the fraction in a fraction. So I'm going to write that as t to the negative

03:57:02.200 --> 03:57:09.200
2. So s of t is equal to t cubed over 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2 power. And then we can

03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:22.040
take the derivative of this function to find the velocity function. So the velocity at

03:57:23.360 --> 03:57:30.360
time t, this is a quotient. So we take the derivative of the top which is 3 t squared

03:57:31.360 --> 03:57:38.360
times the denominator which is 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2 minus the derivative of

03:57:39.000 --> 03:57:46.000
the denominator which is negative 3 times negative 2 is positive 6 t to the negative

03:57:46.400 --> 03:57:53.400
3 times the numerator t cubed all over the denominator 5 minus 3 t to the negative 2

03:57:54.400 --> 03:58:01.400
squared. I'm going to clean that up a little bit just so that we can take a second derivative

03:58:06.360 --> 03:58:12.200
of it because we're also being asked about the acceleration. So when we distribute through

03:58:12.200 --> 03:58:19.200
we get 3 times 5 is 15 t squared minus 9 and when we add the exponents we get 0 t's.

03:58:24.400 --> 03:58:31.400
And then minus 6 and we have 0 t's. Since we have negative 9 minus 6 I'm going to write

03:58:34.320 --> 03:58:41.320
that as negative 15 over and I'm going to go ahead and square this out. We've got 25

03:58:45.480 --> 03:58:52.480
minus 30 t to the negative 2 plus 9 t to the negative 4.

03:58:53.400 --> 03:59:00.400
So we should be able to calculate the velocity after 2 seconds by plugging 2 into this formula

03:59:08.360 --> 03:59:15.360
15 times 2 squared minus 15 over 25 minus 30 times not t but 2 to the negative 2 plus

03:59:15.360 --> 03:59:22.360
9 t which is 2 to the negative 4 power. And we can plug this into our handy dandy calculator.

03:59:26.360 --> 03:59:33.360
Second quit to get me to the home screen. We need a parenthesis around the numerator 15

03:59:36.080 --> 03:59:43.080
times 2 squared minus 15 close the parenthesis the velocity.

03:59:45.560 --> 03:59:52.560
Divided by parenthesis for the denominator 25 minus 30 times 2 raised to the negative

03:59:53.480 --> 04:00:00.480
2 power plus 9 times 2 raised to the negative 4 power and then close the parenthesis on

04:00:03.320 --> 04:00:10.320
the denominator and my velocity at 2 seconds seems to be about 2.49.

04:00:16.360 --> 04:00:23.360
Feet per second almost 2.5 feet every second this guy is going to travel. That's the velocity.

04:00:29.080 --> 04:00:33.960
But the problem is also asking for the acceleration so let's scroll down to give us some more white

04:00:33.960 --> 04:00:40.960
board space. The acceleration then at t is going to be the derivative of the velocity.

04:00:41.960 --> 04:00:48.960
So we've got this derivative of a velocity function. So we'll take the derivative of

04:00:51.120 --> 04:00:58.120
the numerator which is 30 t times the denominator which is 25 minus 30 t to the negative 2 plus

04:01:00.480 --> 04:01:07.480
9 t to the negative 4 minus the derivative of the denominator negative 30 times negative

04:01:07.480 --> 04:01:14.480
2 is positive 60 t to the negative 3 minus 36 t to the negative 5 times the numerator

04:01:24.280 --> 04:01:31.280
which is 15 t squared minus 15 and then that is all over the denominator squared 25 minus

04:01:32.280 --> 04:01:39.280
30 t to the negative 2 plus 9 t to the negative 4 all squared. Now the problem was asking

04:01:43.360 --> 04:01:48.040
us what's the acceleration at 2 seconds. So in order to get that we're going to need

04:01:48.040 --> 04:01:52.680
to go back to our calculators. I'm not going to write it out I'm just going to put 2 in

04:01:52.680 --> 04:01:59.680
for everything all the way across here. So we've got the numerator parenthesis 30 times

04:02:00.640 --> 04:02:07.640
2 open a parenthesis 25 minus 30 times 2 raised to the negative 2 power plus 9 times 2 raised

04:02:15.360 --> 04:02:22.360
to the negative 4 power close the parenthesis minus open a parenthesis 60 times 2 raised

04:02:23.360 --> 04:02:30.360
to the negative 3 power minus 36 times 2 raised to the negative 5 power close the parenthesis

04:02:40.880 --> 04:02:47.880
open a parenthesis 15 times 2 squared minus 15 close the parenthesis and close the parenthesis

04:02:48.320 --> 04:02:55.320
on the numerator divided by denominator open a parenthesis 25 minus 30 t which we know

04:02:59.840 --> 04:03:06.840
is 2 raised to the negative 2 power plus 9 times 2 raised to the negative 4 power close

04:03:10.720 --> 04:03:17.720
the parenthesis on the denominator and square the denominator and hit enter the denominator

04:03:17.880 --> 04:03:24.880
to find out our acceleration is 2.44 feet per second squared. So it might have been ugly

04:03:31.920 --> 04:03:36.720
to type in the calculator but it just took time it wasn't difficult plugging 2 in for

04:03:36.720 --> 04:03:43.160
all those t's. So that's velocity, acceleration and position derivatives of each other but

04:03:43.160 --> 04:03:47.440
the big thing that I want you to practice with these differentiation rules specifically

04:03:47.440 --> 04:03:53.240
focus on the product rule and the quotient rule. The sooner you master those the more

04:03:53.240 --> 04:03:58.960
advantage you will have moving forward in our calculus class. So take a look at those practice

04:03:58.960 --> 04:04:05.960
practice practice and we will see you in class to practice some more.

04:04:05.960 --> 04:04:11.280
Now that we're able to quickly calculate derivatives we're able to look at some applications of

04:04:11.280 --> 04:04:18.280
how we can use the derivative to model some real world situations. So our question is

04:04:18.480 --> 04:04:25.480
what are some applications of the derivative? And the first one we've already kind of hinted

04:04:26.000 --> 04:04:33.000
at over the past couple of lessons but we're going to formalize our discussion around position

04:04:34.440 --> 04:04:41.440
which we use s of t as a function to represent position over time. Velocity is a function

04:04:42.840 --> 04:04:48.840
of the derivative. And the first one we've already kind of hinted at over the past couple

04:04:48.840 --> 04:04:55.840
of lessons. Where we use s of t as a function to represent position over time. Velocity

04:04:57.720 --> 04:05:04.720
where we use v of t to represent the velocity over time. And acceleration. Where we use

04:05:09.120 --> 04:05:16.120
a of t to represent the acceleration at some point in time. Now we've already discussed

04:05:16.760 --> 04:05:23.760
the fact that the velocity is the derivative of position. Or more specifically v of t is

04:05:35.720 --> 04:05:42.720
equal to the s prime of t. And we've also discussed that the acceleration of the derivative

04:05:46.120 --> 04:05:53.120
is the derivative of the velocity. Or a of t is equal to v prime of t or the second derivative

04:06:07.600 --> 04:06:14.600
of the position s prime prime of t. But what we haven't discussed is how velocity and acceleration

04:06:16.680 --> 04:06:23.680
work together or against each other. For example, I want to look at if the acceleration is in

04:06:32.400 --> 04:06:39.400
the same direction as the velocity. And if the acceleration is in the same direction,

04:06:47.120 --> 04:06:54.120
in other words, we're getting more and more push in the direction that we're going. If

04:06:54.240 --> 04:06:59.520
you think about the football player who's trying to get the first down on third and

04:06:59.520 --> 04:07:05.160
inches, the players on his own team are pushing him as he accelerates in the same direction

04:07:05.160 --> 04:07:12.160
as the push. He's going to end up going further and faster. So the object is going to, let

04:07:13.160 --> 04:07:20.160
me put the word behind the front, the object will speed up because we're being pushed

04:07:28.160 --> 04:07:33.780
in the direction we're running so we will run faster. And the opposite is also true

04:07:33.780 --> 04:07:40.780
if they are in opposite directions. And the opposite is also true if they are in opposite

04:07:42.160 --> 04:07:49.160
directions. Sticking with the football player analogy, you've got a football player running

04:07:50.640 --> 04:07:56.840
down field and the defender grabs him and pulls him backwards. It doesn't necessarily

04:07:56.840 --> 04:08:01.440
mean he's going to go backwards, but he's not going to go forward at the same speed

04:08:01.440 --> 04:08:08.440
because those forces are in opposite directions. So because the push and the speed are in opposite

04:08:08.520 --> 04:08:15.520
directions, it or the person slows down. So the acceleration pushes or pulls to either

04:08:21.400 --> 04:08:28.400
speed up or slow down. The question is, are they going in the same direction? So let's

04:08:29.880 --> 04:08:36.880
look at an example. The position of an object, the position of an object, the position of

04:08:38.440 --> 04:08:42.440
an object, actually that's, we're going to have two examples. So let's say number three's

04:08:42.440 --> 04:08:49.440
examples and example A is going to be the position of an object in t seconds is given

04:08:49.440 --> 04:08:56.440
by s of t equals t cubed minus three t squared minus forty five t plus seven. So this is

04:09:20.440 --> 04:09:27.440
the question we want to know is when is it speeding up? And when is it slowing down?

04:09:43.360 --> 04:09:47.400
When are the acceleration and velocity pushing in the same direction? And when are they pushing

04:09:47.440 --> 04:09:54.440
pulling against each other in opposite directions? Let's get us some space to work on that and

04:09:55.360 --> 04:10:01.480
we'll attempt to answer that by first finding the function for the velocity, which is the

04:10:01.480 --> 04:10:08.480
derivative of the s of t. And the derivative there is going to be three t squared minus

04:10:09.200 --> 04:10:16.200
six t minus forty five. The acceleration then is going to be the derivative of the velocity,

04:10:25.800 --> 04:10:32.800
which is going to be six t minus six. So we need to know when these are changing directions.

04:10:33.800 --> 04:10:38.800
When does the velocity change directions from left to right? When does the acceleration

04:10:38.800 --> 04:10:43.800
change from speed up to slow down or push to pull? And so really what we need to know

04:10:43.800 --> 04:10:49.800
is when do they each cross the threshold of zero? Because that's when they change directions

04:10:49.800 --> 04:10:55.800
from positive to negative, from push to pull, from faster to slower. So for each of these

04:10:55.800 --> 04:11:01.800
we're going to solve for when they equal zero. So with the velocity zero equals three t squared

04:11:02.240 --> 04:11:08.920
minus six t minus forty five. And we can solve that by first factoring out the gcf of three

04:11:08.920 --> 04:11:15.920
t squared minus two t minus fifteen. And then continuing to factor that's t minus five

04:11:16.840 --> 04:11:23.840
t plus three. And so setting each factor equal to zero, t is equal to five, or negative

04:11:24.220 --> 04:11:31.220
three. Now generally we don't talk about negative times, so we're going to start at zero for

04:11:31.220 --> 04:11:36.300
all of our time references, so really we don't care about the three. But at five, things

04:11:36.300 --> 04:11:43.300
are probably changing at five because the velocity is changing direction at five.

04:11:44.980 --> 04:11:48.020
Same thing with the acceleration, we want to know when that changes, so we'll make that

04:11:48.020 --> 04:11:55.020
equal to zero, six t minus six. Add six to both sides, and six t equals six, divide by

04:11:56.020 --> 04:12:03.020
six and t equals one, so something else of note is happening at one. So what we want

04:12:03.840 --> 04:12:10.840
to know is if I make a little timeline here, something happens at one, and something happens

04:12:11.900 --> 04:12:18.900
at five. We're going to look at how the velocity and the acceleration are behaving in these

04:12:19.420 --> 04:12:26.420
time ranges. Specifically what we're interested in is are they positive or are they negative?

04:12:32.080 --> 04:12:35.700
Because that's going to tell us if they're pushing each other or if they're pulling against

04:12:35.700 --> 04:12:41.700
each other. Fortunately this is really easy to do on our calculators. What we're going

04:12:41.700 --> 04:12:48.700
to do is we're going to type in the function for the velocity in y one, and then we'll

04:12:50.980 --> 04:12:57.980
type in the function for the acceleration in y two. So y one, the velocity is three

04:12:58.780 --> 04:13:05.780
t squared, we don't really have a t so we're going to use x, minus six t, or x, minus 45.

04:13:06.380 --> 04:13:13.380
And in y two it's six t, or six x, minus six. Then we're going to go to the table settings.

04:13:19.500 --> 04:13:26.340
Second table, and we can delete out whatever we were working on before. And what we'll

04:13:26.340 --> 04:13:33.340
do for our x is we're going to pick an x that falls within each range on this number line.

04:13:34.300 --> 04:13:40.100
So first we need something between zero and one, because our graph really starts at zero,

04:13:40.100 --> 04:13:47.100
and we want to know what's happening in the middle of each of these areas. So between

04:13:47.100 --> 04:13:53.300
zero and one, a good number is point five. Hit enter. And looking at that I see that

04:13:53.300 --> 04:13:59.580
they're both negative. Remember the first, the middle column, the y one is the velocity,

04:13:59.580 --> 04:14:04.660
the next one, the y two is the acceleration. But they're both negative, and that's what's

04:14:04.660 --> 04:14:11.660
important to me right now, is they are negative between zero and one. Now let's pick something

04:14:14.060 --> 04:14:20.660
between one and five, maybe three, three falls between one and five. Notice there the first

04:14:20.660 --> 04:14:27.660
one, the velocity is negative, but the acceleration is positive. So the velocity is negative, but

04:14:28.580 --> 04:14:35.580
the acceleration is positive. Finally we need something past five, maybe eight. We can

04:14:38.120 --> 04:14:44.560
pick any number past five. And when I do that I see that they are both positive. So the

04:14:44.560 --> 04:14:51.560
velocity is positive, and the acceleration is positive. Now we're ready to kind of interpret

04:14:52.120 --> 04:14:58.120
what we've got here. When the velocity and the acceleration are both going in the same

04:14:58.280 --> 04:15:04.280
direction, notice between zero and one they're both negative. That means the velocity it's

04:15:04.280 --> 04:15:09.280
going backwards, and the acceleration is pushing further backwards, same direction,

04:15:09.280 --> 04:15:15.780
we're going backwards at a faster and faster rate, we're actually speeding up between zero

04:15:16.220 --> 04:15:23.220
and one. Then between one and five we see they're going in opposite directions. The

04:15:25.380 --> 04:15:30.260
velocity is negative, so we're going backwards, but the acceleration is pulling it forward,

04:15:30.260 --> 04:15:35.420
so it's starting to slow down and slow down and slow down because they're pulling in

04:15:35.420 --> 04:15:41.620
opposite directions. Until finally the acceleration wins and gets the velocity going in the other

04:15:41.660 --> 04:15:47.020
direction, and now they're both going in the positive direction with the acceleration pushing

04:15:47.020 --> 04:15:53.220
in the positive direction, so we're going faster and faster. So again when they're the

04:15:53.220 --> 04:16:00.220
same we're speeding up, when they're different we're slowing down. So giving it as a range

04:16:01.620 --> 04:16:08.420
this item is speeding up between zero and one second, union five all the way to infinity,

04:16:08.420 --> 04:16:15.420
and we'll always speed up while it's going to slow down between one and five.

04:16:19.300 --> 04:16:23.140
Let's do another example where we can take a look at how the position of an object is

04:16:23.140 --> 04:16:30.140
changing whether it's being pushed or pulled in the same direction or in the opposite direction.

04:16:31.140 --> 04:16:38.140
So let's say the position of an object in seconds, using t for seconds, is given by s of t equals

04:16:38.420 --> 04:16:45.420
x cubed minus 9x squared plus 24x minus 3, and so our question, our theme, is given

04:16:49.820 --> 04:16:56.820
by s of t equals x cubed minus 9x squared plus 24x minus 3, and so our question is

04:17:08.460 --> 04:17:15.460
when is it speeding up and slowing down? And we can decide that by looking at the velocity

04:17:24.340 --> 04:17:30.780
function and the acceleration function, and determine when they're pushing or pulling

04:17:30.780 --> 04:17:37.380
in the same direction or opposite directions. So the velocity, that's just the derivative

04:17:37.380 --> 04:17:44.380
of the position, which is 3x squared minus 18x plus 24, the acceleration, it's the derivative

04:17:49.060 --> 04:17:56.060
of the velocity, so that's 6x minus 18, and we're specifically interested when both of

04:17:56.060 --> 04:18:02.560
these are changing between positive and negative because that's where things are going to change,

04:18:02.560 --> 04:18:09.560
and they change at 0. So 0 equals 3x squared minus 18x plus 24 on the velocity, we'll factor

04:18:13.520 --> 04:18:20.520
out a 3x squared minus 6x plus 4, nope, plus 8, sorry, 24 divided by 3 is 8, 0 equals 3

04:18:20.520 --> 04:18:27.520
times x minus 4 times x minus 2, and so this time we have two solutions, x equals 4 and

04:18:34.800 --> 04:18:41.800
x equals 2. With the acceleration we get our other key point by making it equal to 0, 6x

04:18:42.680 --> 04:18:49.680
minus 18. If we add 18 to both sides and divide by 6, we get x is equal to 3. So something

04:18:50.520 --> 04:18:57.520
is probably happening at 2, 3, and 4. So we'll make our little number line here, 0, 2, 3,

04:19:04.160 --> 04:19:11.160
and 4, and we're going to be interested in what happens to the velocity and what happens

04:19:11.160 --> 04:19:18.160
to the acceleration. Again, we'll use our calculator to help us do this a little quick,

04:19:20.520 --> 04:19:27.640
quicker, hit y equals, and we're going to clear out the functions that are in here, make

04:19:27.640 --> 04:19:33.640
sure you clear them out so you don't accidentally get the previous problem in here. The velocity

04:19:33.640 --> 04:19:40.640
was 3x squared minus 18x, oops, x, 18x, there we go, plus 24, and we're going to be interested

04:19:50.520 --> 04:19:57.520
in 4, and the acceleration is 6x minus 18, hit second table, delete out the old points,

04:20:07.440 --> 04:20:13.160
and we need something between 0 and 2, 1 is between 0 and 2, and we've got a positive,

04:20:13.160 --> 04:20:18.760
then a negative. The velocity is positive, the acceleration is negative, they're going

04:20:18.800 --> 04:20:25.800
in opposite directions to begin with. Between 2 and 3, let's try 2.5, now they're both negative.

04:20:28.480 --> 04:20:33.480
Looks like the acceleration ended up winning here, so the velocity is negative and the

04:20:33.480 --> 04:20:40.480
acceleration is negative. Pick something between 3 and 4, maybe 3.5. Now notice the velocity

04:20:41.480 --> 04:20:48.480
is negative, but the acceleration has changed to positive, so the velocity is still negative,

04:20:51.440 --> 04:20:57.940
but the acceleration is now pulling it in the positive direction. Finally, bigger than

04:20:57.940 --> 04:21:05.440
4, we can pick any number bigger than 4, I picked 5, we see they're both positive, so

04:21:05.440 --> 04:21:12.440
now the velocity is positive and the acceleration is positive, and it's going to stay that way

04:21:12.720 --> 04:21:19.720
all the way up to infinity. So we see initially the velocity is positive, the acceleration

04:21:22.960 --> 04:21:27.800
is negative, they're in opposite directions, it's going to slow down there. Between 2 and

04:21:27.800 --> 04:21:33.160
3 they're in the same direction, it's going to speed up. Between 3 and 4 they're in opposite

04:21:33.200 --> 04:21:39.120
directions, slowing down, and then 4 on up it's going to speed up. So writing that as

04:21:39.120 --> 04:21:46.120
a range, we're speeding up between 2 and 3, union from 4 to infinity, and we're slowing

04:21:49.880 --> 04:21:56.880
down from 0 to 2, union from 3 to 4, this particle is actually slowing down to ultimately

04:21:56.960 --> 04:22:03.960
change directions. So that's one application of the derivative, position, velocity, acceleration,

04:22:11.480 --> 04:22:18.480
speeding up, and slowing down. A second application that we're going to take a look at is in business,

04:22:18.900 --> 04:22:25.900
with the idea of revenue, cost, profit, and what are called marginal changes. When we

04:22:26.120 --> 04:22:33.120
say a marginal change in business, that is the change for revenue, cost, profit, and what

04:22:33.540 --> 04:22:40.540
are called marginal changes. When we say a marginal change in business, that is the change

04:22:40.540 --> 04:22:47.540
for one more. And usually this is on the large scale, so once I make 1,000 widgets, if I make

04:22:50.340 --> 04:22:57.340
one more widget, 1,001 widgets, is it more profitable or less profitable, more cost, less cost,

04:22:57.340 --> 04:23:04.340
making one more, how's that going to affect my bottom line? And that can help us make

04:23:05.140 --> 04:23:12.140
the decision if it's worth expanding or shrinking the business at this given time. Because we're

04:23:12.540 --> 04:23:18.540
talking about change, a marginal change, which is a very small change, we are going to make

04:23:18.540 --> 04:23:25.540
one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more, one more,

04:23:27.340 --> 04:23:34.340
we can estimate the marginal change with the derivative. Let's break down some of these

04:23:44.620 --> 04:23:51.620
business terms. We've got cost, which we normally represent with c of x, and we've got marginal

04:23:52.540 --> 04:23:59.540
cost. For marginal cost, we do m c of x for marginal cost, which is actually estimated,

04:24:08.500 --> 04:24:15.500
not actually, but estimated by the derivative of the cost function. We've also got revenue.

04:24:22.460 --> 04:24:28.740
Revenue, we usually use r of x for revenue, and often we have to find that because what

04:24:28.740 --> 04:24:34.940
we actually have is some price function that needs to be multiplied by the number of things

04:24:34.940 --> 04:24:41.940
that we sell. So if the price is $5 and we sell $7, 5 times 7, we've made $21 in revenue.

04:24:42.940 --> 04:24:49.940
This price function, the price per item, is often a function because the price is going

04:25:00.420 --> 04:25:07.420
to be dependent on various variables. So we've got the revenue, and we've also got marginal

04:25:08.100 --> 04:25:15.100
revenue, and as you might expect, we use mr for marginal revenue of x, which can be estimated

04:25:19.620 --> 04:25:26.620
using the derivative of the revenue. Finally, what we're always interested in in business

04:25:29.740 --> 04:25:36.740
is the profit. The profit is p of x, which is simply calculated by taking the revenue

04:25:37.540 --> 04:25:44.540
or the amount of money we took in and subtracting the cost that it took to bring in that money.

04:25:46.020 --> 04:25:53.020
And we also have a marginal profit, or how much more money do we make for selling one

04:25:55.340 --> 04:26:01.340
more? So marginal profit of x, as you might expect, is equal to the derivative of the

04:26:01.340 --> 04:26:08.340
profit at x. So those are kind of the parts of the profit function. Let's take a look

04:26:14.300 --> 04:26:21.300
at some examples and see if we can wrap our head around what is this marginal profit, marginal

04:26:22.260 --> 04:26:29.260
cost, and marginal revenue. First, the cost of the profit is p of x, which is equal to

04:26:32.340 --> 04:26:39.340
to develop a product is c of x is equal to 500 plus 12x. Startup cost of 500, and then

04:26:50.420 --> 04:26:57.420
each one costs $12. You want to know what is the marginal cost

04:27:01.340 --> 04:27:08.340
of the 100 first item. Now, a nice way to estimate the marginal cost of x is to simply

04:27:18.940 --> 04:27:24.980
take the derivative of the cost function. Well, this is really nice because the derivative

04:27:24.980 --> 04:27:31.980
of 500 plus 12x is just 12. So we will estimate that the 12th item will cost 12 extra dollars.

04:27:35.260 --> 04:27:40.420
I'm sorry, the 100th item will cost 12 extra dollars because every single one we add to

04:27:40.420 --> 04:27:47.420
it costs 12 extra dollars. That is probably a less exciting example. So let's try a price

04:27:47.420 --> 04:27:55.220
function. The price function for the product, same product, is p equals 126 minus 0.16 x.

04:28:18.100 --> 04:28:25.100
We want to know what is the marginal revenue for the 100 first item. So first we need

04:28:25.100 --> 04:28:32.100
to know what is the revenue function. Remember, revenue is always x times the price function.

04:28:32.100 --> 04:28:39.820
The number of things we sell times the price for each one of those. That is 126 minus 0.16x.

04:29:02.860 --> 04:29:09.860
If I distribute to make the derivative easier, 126x minus 0.16x squared. So then the marginal

04:29:14.500 --> 04:29:21.500
revenue of x is pretty darn close to the derivative of the revenue. So that is 126 minus 0.32x.

04:29:21.500 --> 04:29:28.500
So that is 126 minus 0.32x. And we want to know the marginal revenue of the 100 first

04:29:33.900 --> 04:29:40.900
item. So we can plug 101 into this function to estimate it. 126 minus 0.32 times 101.

04:29:43.780 --> 04:29:50.780
And quickly typing that in my calculator we will get 93 dollars and 68 cents. Which means

04:29:51.500 --> 04:29:58.500
after I've sold 100 items the 101st item is going to make me another 93 dollars and 68

04:29:58.900 --> 04:30:05.900
cents. Or so. How accurate is that estimate? Because remember I did say it is an estimate.

04:30:10.620 --> 04:30:17.620
Let's find out. Note the actual. Because the derivative is just an estimate, it's going

04:30:18.380 --> 04:30:25.880
to be off by a bit. Because the tangent line touches at 100. But not necessarily at 101,

04:30:25.880 --> 04:30:32.060
it's off by a little bit. So we could calculate the revenue at 100. How much revenue we've

04:30:32.060 --> 04:30:39.060
already made at 100? So the revenue equation was 126 times 100 minus 0.16 times 100 squared.

04:30:40.060 --> 04:30:47.060
And plug that into my calculator we actually make $11,000. The revenue at 101 is 126 times

04:30:55.100 --> 04:31:02.100
101 minus 0.16 times 101 squared. We make $11,093.84. And so if we want the marginal revenue that

04:31:09.180 --> 04:31:16.180
is how much more we made for the 101st item. We subtract these. 11,093.84 minus 11,000.

04:31:19.420 --> 04:31:26.180
We actually get 93 dollars and 84 cents is the actual marginal revenue. The 101st item

04:31:26.180 --> 04:31:33.180
actually brings us in 93.84. But much quicker with the derivative we estimated 93.68 which

04:31:34.180 --> 04:31:39.180
is pretty darn close and probably good enough for this business to make a decision based

04:31:39.180 --> 04:31:46.180
on. We're not going to care about less than about 15 cents, 16 cents of a difference when

04:31:46.540 --> 04:31:52.180
we're trying to make decisions on our product whether to expand or contract. So that's why

04:31:52.180 --> 04:31:59.180
it's always better to use the derivative because it's quicker, it's easier, it's clearer

04:31:59.180 --> 04:32:05.180
to understand. The actuals just take too long to calculate and really don't make much of

04:32:05.180 --> 04:32:12.180
a difference. So we've done costs and we've done revenue. Let's add one more though. What's

04:32:12.820 --> 04:32:19.820
the marginal profit? For the 101st item.

04:32:29.180 --> 04:32:36.180
Well, remember P of X, the profit is equal to the revenue function minus the cost function.

04:32:45.500 --> 04:32:52.000
And the revenue function, we've got it up here above on part B. It's 126X minus 0.16X

04:32:52.000 --> 04:32:59.000
squared minus the cost function which was given to us up here in part A, 500 plus 12X.

04:33:05.560 --> 04:33:11.760
So distributing that minus, because we have to subtract the whole thing, minus 500 minus

04:33:11.760 --> 04:33:18.760
12X. And then actually combining like terms we get negative 0.16X squared plus 0.16X

04:33:22.520 --> 04:33:29.520
114X minus 16X. Oops, minus 500. Keep things in the right order. And so if we want the

04:33:35.040 --> 04:33:41.240
marginal profit, we take the derivative. The marginal profit of X is equal to the derivative

04:33:41.240 --> 04:33:48.240
of the profit function which is negative 0.32X plus 114. And then we get the marginal profit

04:33:53.000 --> 04:34:00.000
and we want the marginal profit of the 101st item. So plugging 101 in there, negative 0.32

04:34:02.720 --> 04:34:09.720
times 101 plus 114. If we were to make one more item, we would make an additional $81.68

04:34:14.480 --> 04:34:21.480
our marginal profit. I want to make a difference in the marginal profit.

04:34:22.000 --> 04:34:27.600
We want to do one more application of the derivative based on where we're at right now.

04:34:27.600 --> 04:34:34.600
And that is in population change. Truth is anytime you see the word change, we're really

04:34:37.880 --> 04:34:44.880
dealing with a derivative in action. Anything that changes is the derivative. So with population

04:34:45.540 --> 04:34:52.540
change, if we use P of t to represent the population at time t, then the derivative

04:35:01.040 --> 04:35:08.040
P prime of t is the rate of change of the population. And so if we use P of t to represent

04:35:14.880 --> 04:35:21.880
the population, so for example, if I have a bacteria population that is growing according

04:35:35.080 --> 04:35:42.080
to the function, P of t is equal to X cubed. So if I have a bacteria population that is

04:35:44.880 --> 04:35:51.880
cubed minus 18 X squared plus 96 X plus 20, where t is in hours, when is the population

04:35:51.880 --> 04:35:58.880
growing and shrinking. And so if we use P of t to represent the population at time t,

04:36:22.880 --> 04:36:27.040
we want to know when it's growing and shrinking, we're talking about the derivative. We're

04:36:27.040 --> 04:36:33.880
talking about the change. So the change in the population, P prime of t, the derivative

04:36:33.880 --> 04:36:40.880
of that function is 3 X squared minus 36 X plus 96. And where the change happens between

04:36:44.440 --> 04:36:50.520
growth and shrinking, growth the derivative is positive because it's going up. Shrinking

04:36:50.520 --> 04:36:56.840
the derivative is negative, it's going down. So it changes when the derivative is equal

04:36:56.840 --> 04:37:03.840
to zero. So zero equals 3 X squared minus 36 X plus 96. And we know we can solve this

04:37:05.640 --> 04:37:12.640
by factoring. Factor out the GCF of 3 times X squared minus 12 X plus 32. Zero equals

04:37:13.360 --> 04:37:20.360
3 times X minus 8 and X minus 4. I probably should have t's not X's because it's P of

04:37:28.240 --> 04:37:35.240
t. I'll change to P of X then it works. P of X. So X is equal to 8 and 4 hours. So

04:37:35.880 --> 04:37:42.880
at 8 and 4 things are changing. So if we got a timeline here, at 4 things change and at

04:37:46.320 --> 04:37:53.320
8 things change. What is happening with P prime of X? What is happening to the derivative?

04:37:54.120 --> 04:38:01.120
Are we increasing or decreasing? Is the derivative positive or negative? So again we'll go to

04:38:01.120 --> 04:38:08.120
our calculator, hit Y equals, clear out these other formulas, and our population is changing

04:38:08.520 --> 04:38:15.520
according to 3 X squared minus 36 X plus 96. And if we hit second table, we can try out

04:38:21.680 --> 04:38:28.180
a few values for time and see if this is, the derivative is positive or negative. If

04:38:28.260 --> 04:38:34.060
it's positive it's increasing. If it's negative it's decreasing. Between 0 and 4 we'll try

04:38:34.060 --> 04:38:41.060
2. We see it's positive. Between 4 and 8 we'll try 5. Negative. Bigger than 8, 9. It's positive.

04:38:45.260 --> 04:38:52.260
So it goes positive, negative, positive. Positive, negative, positive. So what that means is

04:38:53.000 --> 04:39:00.000
the population is growing wherever the derivative is positive. Between 0 and 4 hours, union,

04:39:04.260 --> 04:39:11.260
and then from 8 to infinite hours it's never going to stop growing. And it's shrinking in

04:39:11.900 --> 04:39:18.900
between 4 and 8 hours because the derivative is negative. So we're talking about population,

04:39:18.900 --> 04:39:25.900
business, and physics with velocity and acceleration. A couple key applications of the derivative. We'll

04:39:25.900 --> 04:39:29.780
talk about more as the course develops, but that's enough to get you going for now. We

04:39:29.780 --> 04:39:36.780
will see you in class to dive into these a little bit deeper. Up until now we've avoided

04:39:38.780 --> 04:39:43.420
really talking about trigonometric functions and the derivatives. So today we're going

04:39:44.100 --> 04:39:51.100
to attempt to answer the question of what are the derivatives of the trig functions,

04:40:01.460 --> 04:40:08.460
sine, cosine, tangent, and also the less used ones of cosecant, secant, and cotangent.

04:40:08.920 --> 04:40:15.920
And to begin setting this up we're going to look at the graph of f of x equals sine x.

04:40:18.340 --> 04:40:25.340
And you'll remember from your days of trigonometry it has a maximum of 1 and a minimum at negative

04:40:25.340 --> 04:40:32.340
1. And then at pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over 2, and 2 pi, things get excited. So we're going

04:40:39.140 --> 04:40:46.140
to go in the other direction, same thing, negative pi over 2, negative pi, negative 3 pi over

04:40:46.140 --> 04:40:53.140
2, and negative 2 pi. And if you remember the sine of x starts at 0, it reaches a maximum

04:40:55.180 --> 04:41:02.180
at pi over 2, back to 0, minimum at 3 pi over 2, and back to 0, doing kind of the same

04:41:03.180 --> 04:41:10.180
exact thing in the opposite direction when we are on the other side. So the sine of x

04:41:11.580 --> 04:41:18.580
is this familiar graph. If that's the sine of x, then what I want to graph next to it

04:41:24.820 --> 04:41:31.820
is see if we can graph the derivative of the sine of x.

04:41:32.460 --> 04:41:39.460
Using kind of the same scale we had before with pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over 2, 2 pi, negative

04:41:44.740 --> 04:41:51.740
pi over 2, negative pi, negative 3 pi over 2, and negative 2 pi. And what I want to

04:41:52.980 --> 04:41:59.980
notice as we graph the derivative, f prime of x, as we graph the derivative I want to

04:42:00.580 --> 04:42:07.580
notice first off where the derivative is 0. Notice the derivative is 0 at negative 3

04:42:07.580 --> 04:42:14.580
pi over 2, it's 0 at negative pi over 2, it's 0 at positive pi over 2, and it's 0 at 3 pi

04:42:17.820 --> 04:42:24.820
over 2. And also I want to notice it starts out increasing, starts out increasing, starts

04:42:25.740 --> 04:42:32.740
out increasing from the negative 2 pi up to the 0. So that means it's going to start

04:42:36.260 --> 04:42:43.260
positive down to our negative 3 pi over 2. Then it's decreasing, meaning our derivative

04:42:43.900 --> 04:42:50.900
is negative up until it reaches pi over 2. Then we're going uphill and we're positive

04:42:51.260 --> 04:42:58.260
again up until the graph equals pi over 2, then decreasing all the way until we equal

04:43:01.060 --> 04:43:08.060
3 pi over 2, then increasing or positive all the way up to 2 pi. And so we end up with

04:43:09.540 --> 04:43:14.000
this derivative graph, and what's interesting is this derivative graph should look familiar

04:43:14.000 --> 04:43:20.840
to us. Notice at 0 it starts at 1 and it's got the same shape as our familiar cosine,

04:43:21.780 --> 04:43:28.280
cosine of x function. So in other words what we've discovered here is that the derivative

04:43:28.280 --> 04:43:35.280
of sine appears at least from the graph to be the cosine of x. Well let's take the derivative

04:43:36.720 --> 04:43:43.720
of this graph, just a little too tall, want to have room for a label, and doing the same

04:43:43.880 --> 04:43:50.880
thing now. Oops, let's try that again. Let's see if we get something else familiar when

04:44:03.600 --> 04:44:10.200
we take the second derivative, f prime prime of x, or the derivative of cosine to see what

04:44:10.200 --> 04:44:17.200
we end up with here. Let's label here we've got negative pi over 2, negative pi, negative

04:44:17.200 --> 04:44:24.200
3 pi over 2, and negative 2 pi. Going the other direction we have pi over 2, pi, 3 pi over

04:44:24.320 --> 04:44:31.320
2, and 2 pi. And again noticing where the derivative is 0 at negative 2 pi, it's 0 at

04:44:32.240 --> 04:44:39.240
negative pi, it's 0 at 0, and it's 0 at pi, and again it's going to be 0 at 2 pi. But

04:44:47.360 --> 04:44:53.960
this time the graph starts out decreasing, which means it has to start off negative.

04:44:53.960 --> 04:45:00.960
So it's going to start off negative up until it reaches the negative pi. Then between the

04:45:01.440 --> 04:45:08.440
zeroes it's increasing, so the derivative has to be positive until it reaches the 0, decreasing,

04:45:10.440 --> 04:45:16.440
indicating the derivative is negative, and then increasing, indicating the derivative

04:45:16.440 --> 04:45:23.440
is positive, up until the 0. Now what we might hope is that there's this relationship

04:45:25.200 --> 04:45:28.520
that the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of cosine is sine, but that's

04:45:28.520 --> 04:45:34.920
not quite the case because sine starts out increasing, this one starts out decreasing.

04:45:34.920 --> 04:45:41.120
It's actually flipped over the x-axis from the sine graph. In other words this red graph

04:45:41.120 --> 04:45:48.120
here is actually the graph of negative sine of x. And so really what we found is that

04:45:50.000 --> 04:45:57.000
the derivative of the sine of x is equal to the cosine of x, and that the derivative

04:45:58.000 --> 04:46:05.000
of the cosine of x turned out to be the negative sine of x, at least graphically. So can we

04:46:09.760 --> 04:46:16.760
use that information then to learn what the derivative is of the tangent of x? Well what's

04:46:18.380 --> 04:46:25.380
nice about the tangent is we know that tangent is actually the sine of x divided by the cosine.

04:46:27.420 --> 04:46:32.980
Of x, we have that property from trig, which means really all we have to do is use the

04:46:32.980 --> 04:46:39.980
quotient rule. The derivative of sine, we said was cosine x, times the denominator, cosine

04:46:41.300 --> 04:46:48.300
x, minus the derivative of the denominator, the derivative of cosine is negative sine,

04:46:49.380 --> 04:46:55.880
negative negative makes it positive, times the numerator which is the sine of x, all

04:46:55.900 --> 04:47:02.900
over the denominator, squared. So what we have really is cosine squared of x, plus sine

04:47:07.020 --> 04:47:14.020
squared of x, all over cosine squared of x, but that numerator should look really familiar

04:47:16.220 --> 04:47:23.220
to us. We should recognize from our trig days that sine squared plus cosine squared is

04:47:23.540 --> 04:47:30.540
one. So we have one over cosine squared of x, but cosine is just the reciprocal of secant,

04:47:34.080 --> 04:47:41.080
and so we end up with secant squared of x. The derivative of tangent is secant squared.

04:47:46.640 --> 04:47:49.920
Well similar to what we just did with the tangent of x and using the quotient rule,

04:47:49.940 --> 04:47:56.940
we can work our way through all the other trig derivatives, so similarly we complete all

04:48:04.220 --> 04:48:11.220
the trig derivatives. In fact, the remaining three are left to a homework assignment, but

04:48:12.220 --> 04:48:19.220
here they are in their properties. The derivative of the sine of x is equal to the cosine of x,

04:48:26.860 --> 04:48:33.860
the derivative of the cosine of x is the negative sine of x, the derivative of the tangent

04:48:34.180 --> 04:48:41.180
of x is the secant squared of x. Those are the ones we just played with, but the other

04:48:43.420 --> 04:48:47.920
three which are left to an exercise in the homework, the derivative of the secant of

04:48:47.920 --> 04:48:54.920
x, turns out to be the secant of x times the tangent of x, the derivative of the reciprocal

04:48:55.280 --> 04:49:02.280
of cosine, or the derivative of the reciprocal of sine, which is cosecant of x, is negative

04:49:10.100 --> 04:49:17.100
cosecant of x, cotangent of x, and the derivative of the cotangent of x is equal to negative

04:49:17.220 --> 04:49:24.220
cosecant squared of x. These six trig identities, at least sine and cosine you should have memorized,

04:49:34.660 --> 04:49:41.660
but ultimately we're going to have to be able to use all six of these trig derivatives.

04:49:47.540 --> 04:49:54.540
Six important formulas for us to learn. That's what we're going to focus on today. Actually

04:49:57.300 --> 04:50:01.380
that's all there is that's new. We can just combine all of this with things like our

04:50:01.380 --> 04:50:08.380
product rule, our quotient rule, our polynomial rules, and calculate a whole bunch of derivatives.

04:50:08.780 --> 04:50:15.780
So let's see if we can use these in a couple examples.

04:50:17.700 --> 04:50:24.700
First we're going to look at f of x equals three x to the fourth sine of x plus seven

04:50:28.700 --> 04:50:35.700
over x. Now one thing you might notice is that seven over x we can rewrite. So let's

04:50:36.420 --> 04:50:43.100
rewrite it as three x to the fourth sine x plus seven x to the negative one so we can

04:50:43.100 --> 04:50:50.100
use our polynomial formulas. And then we'll start calculating the derivative of f of x.

04:50:53.340 --> 04:50:57.540
First thing I notice is we really have a product rule to start us off. We've got three x to

04:50:57.540 --> 04:51:03.780
the fourth times the sine of x. So to do the product rule we take the derivative of the

04:51:03.780 --> 04:51:10.780
first which is twelve x cubed times the second sine of x plus the derivative of the second

04:51:14.060 --> 04:51:19.660
the derivative of sine is cosine x times the first and I'll just put it in front to make

04:51:19.660 --> 04:51:26.660
it obvious that it's not inside the cosine. And then after the product rule we still have

04:51:26.660 --> 04:51:32.100
to take care of the plus seven x to the negative one. Seven times negative one is negative seven

04:51:32.100 --> 04:51:39.100
x to the negative two and we've got our derivative. Let's try another one that might be a little

04:51:39.620 --> 04:51:46.620
more involved. Let's say f of x is equal to the cosine of x minus x to the fifth times

04:51:49.780 --> 04:51:56.780
the cotangent of x plus the secant of x. Now it should be clear here we're working with

04:51:57.540 --> 04:52:04.540
a product. Two pieces multiplied together so we have to do the product rule for f prime

04:52:09.980 --> 04:52:16.180
of x for the derivative. So we'll take the derivative of the first term or the first

04:52:16.180 --> 04:52:23.180
factor. The derivative of cosine x is negative sine x minus x to the fifth becomes five

04:52:23.380 --> 04:52:30.380
x to the fourth times the second cotangent x plus secant of x plus the derivative of

04:52:37.780 --> 04:52:44.780
the second. The derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared of x plus the derivative

04:52:44.780 --> 04:52:51.780
of secant is secant x tangent x and then we have to multiply by the first part, the cosine

04:53:01.020 --> 04:53:08.020
x minus x to the fifth. And we've got our derivative. One more for this video.

04:53:15.500 --> 04:53:22.500
f of x is equal to tangent of x minus three x to the fourth over cosecant of x minus seven.

04:53:32.940 --> 04:53:39.940
Now we're dividing two functions. With division we know we need to use the quotient rule just

04:53:40.780 --> 04:53:47.780
like we always have before. The quotient rule says we take the derivative of the top. The

04:53:48.180 --> 04:53:55.180
derivative of tangent we now know is secant squared of x minus three times four is twelve

04:53:56.300 --> 04:54:03.300
x cubed. The derivative of the top times the bottom cosecant x minus seven minus the derivative

04:54:03.780 --> 04:54:10.780
of the bottom. The derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant, so a negative negative

04:54:15.020 --> 04:54:22.020
makes it positive, cosecant x cotangent x times the numerator times the first part. Tangent

04:54:22.020 --> 04:54:29.020
x minus three x to the fourth. And that's all over the denominator squared, cosecant

04:54:39.100 --> 04:54:46.100
x minus seven squared. So today's video is really short because there's not a lot of

04:54:46.820 --> 04:54:53.820
new stuff to add. All we have now is we've added the six trig derivatives, and then we

04:54:54.220 --> 04:54:59.220
kind of tie them into all the other derivative rules that we've seen before. The quotient

04:54:59.220 --> 04:55:05.220
rule, the product rule, the polynomial rules, and just continue to practice taking these

04:55:05.220 --> 04:55:11.220
important derivatives. With calculus and derivatives, practice, practice, practice is the key until

04:55:12.140 --> 04:55:19.140
you can do these derivatives in your sleep. So go ahead and try some of these off the

04:55:19.420 --> 04:55:24.140
homework assignment. This video is shorter to give you more time to get into the practice,

04:55:24.140 --> 04:55:31.140
and we'll dive into these more in class. I'll look forward to seeing you then.

04:55:32.340 --> 04:55:36.780
Quite often when we're trying to find the derivative of a function, we find that we

04:55:36.820 --> 04:55:43.820
actually have a composite function, or a function inside a function. And so that's the question

04:55:43.820 --> 04:55:50.820
we're going to address today is how do we take a derivative of a composite function?

04:56:07.540 --> 04:56:14.540
A function inside of a function. And really the short answer to that is we use something

04:56:18.340 --> 04:56:25.340
that is called the chain rule, which officially is written that the derivative of a function

04:56:29.460 --> 04:56:36.460
with another function inside it is equal to the derivative of the outside function, which

04:56:36.780 --> 04:56:43.780
is where the inside stays the same. Actually, I should use square brackets there, times

04:56:44.980 --> 04:56:51.980
the derivative of the inside function. So in words, it's probably easier to remember

04:56:52.740 --> 04:56:59.740
the chain rule is we take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the outside

04:57:07.780 --> 04:57:14.780
of the inside. And that's what we're going to take a look at today. I've got seven examples

04:57:17.300 --> 04:57:21.460
where we basically do this process over and over again. We take the derivative of the

04:57:21.460 --> 04:57:28.460
outside times the derivative of the inside. But this chain rule is one that you should

04:57:28.980 --> 04:57:35.980
be very comfortable with completing, working through, in order to take derivatives. So

04:57:37.420 --> 04:57:44.420
let's take a look at some examples where we take the derivative of the outside times the

04:57:51.500 --> 04:57:58.500
derivative of the inside. Let's say we've got a function f of x equals one over 4x minus

04:57:58.700 --> 04:58:05.700
seven cubed. Now one thing I notice with this to make it easier to remember is that

04:58:06.780 --> 04:58:10.260
it's really easier to take the derivative. We could use the quotient rule, but that's

04:58:10.260 --> 04:58:15.140
just way too much work for what we need to do, because we've just got a one in the numerator.

04:58:15.140 --> 04:58:20.900
This is really 4x minus seven with a negative three exponent, because the negative exponent

04:58:20.900 --> 04:58:27.900
makes it a reciprocal one over that. So what we see we've actually got here is the 4x

04:58:28.900 --> 04:58:35.900
minus three as a block is all raised to the negative three power. If this was just x to

04:58:44.460 --> 04:58:51.060
the negative three, we know the derivative of that is negative three x to the negative

04:58:51.060 --> 04:58:57.340
four. So that's kind of what we're going to do here, but we're going to use the 4x minus

04:58:57.340 --> 04:59:04.340
seven in place of that x. So we pull the exponent out front, and f prime of x is equal to negative

04:59:10.100 --> 04:59:17.100
three times the base, the 4x minus seven, all to the negative four power. Now the only

04:59:17.380 --> 04:59:24.380
thing we have to do is multiply by the derivative of the inside, and the derivative of 4x minus

04:59:24.580 --> 04:59:31.580
seven is just four. We'll clean that up a bit. Let's see the negative three times four

04:59:37.260 --> 04:59:42.260
is negative twelve, so we've got negative twelve times 4x minus seven to the negative

04:59:42.260 --> 04:59:49.260
four power as our final derivative. But the idea here is we identified that we've got

04:59:50.940 --> 04:59:57.940
that 4x minus seven inside another function, which is the x to the negative three. So we

04:59:59.220 --> 05:00:06.220
took the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside. So let's look at

05:00:07.140 --> 05:00:14.140
another one. Let's say we had f of x equals the square root of 3x squared minus seven

05:00:16.020 --> 05:00:23.020
x plus one. Now again, we recognize square root is really an exponent. We've really got

05:00:25.420 --> 05:00:32.420
3x squared minus 7x plus one to the one half power. And so what we need to recognize here

05:00:32.420 --> 05:00:39.420
is we have a function inside of a function. What we really have is the 3x squared minus

05:00:41.260 --> 05:00:48.260
7x plus one, that function sitting inside a one half power. In other words, this is kind

05:00:49.780 --> 05:00:54.820
of the same idea as if we had x to the one half power. We know how to take the derivative

05:00:54.820 --> 05:01:00.820
of x to the one half power, that's one half x to the negative one half, bringing the x

05:01:00.820 --> 05:01:06.460
exponent out front and then reducing the exponent by one. The only difference is instead of

05:01:06.460 --> 05:01:13.460
having an x, we're going to have the 3x squared minus 7x plus one. So our derivative is we

05:01:18.100 --> 05:01:25.100
pull the exponent out front, it's one half times the stuff, 3x squared minus 7x plus

05:01:25.580 --> 05:01:32.580
one, and then we reduce the exponent by one, giving us negative one half. The only thing

05:01:34.260 --> 05:01:41.260
we have to do in addition is multiply by the derivative of what's inside. The derivative

05:01:42.620 --> 05:01:49.620
of 3x squared minus 7x plus one is 6x minus seven, and there we have our final answer.

05:01:50.620 --> 05:01:55.220
The only thing we might want to do is clean up a bit because we've got that negative

05:01:55.220 --> 05:02:01.580
exponent in a fraction going on. I'll leave the 6x minus seven in the numerator, the two

05:02:01.580 --> 05:02:08.580
is in a denominator, and the 3x squared minus 7x plus one with the negative exponent moves

05:02:08.940 --> 05:02:15.100
down. That just cleans it up, it's not really a needed step, but it does make it a little

05:02:15.100 --> 05:02:22.100
prettier. But now we have our derivative. Let's try to increase in complexity a little

05:02:24.820 --> 05:02:31.820
bit as we continue working through these problems. Let's go to a trig problem. What if we have

05:02:33.220 --> 05:02:40.220
f of x equals the cosine of 5x squared? What if we have the cosine of 5x squared?

05:02:45.300 --> 05:02:52.300
With this one, what you notice is we have got the 5x squared sitting inside of a cosine.

05:02:56.660 --> 05:03:03.660
So we'll take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside. The derivative

05:03:04.460 --> 05:03:11.460
of cosine is, let's mark this as f prime of x equals, the derivative of cosine is negative

05:03:12.380 --> 05:03:19.380
sine of the stuff, 5x squared, and then we multiply by the derivative of the inside,

05:03:23.420 --> 05:03:30.420
which is 10x. Clean this up a little bit and we'll move the 10x to the front so we just

05:03:32.260 --> 05:03:39.260
see negative 10x sine of 5x squared, and we've got r.

05:03:42.060 --> 05:03:49.060
The derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside. What about this one? f of x

05:03:55.940 --> 05:04:02.940
equals secant squared of x. What's the outside and what's the inside function?

05:04:02.940 --> 05:04:09.940
Another way to think about secant squared of x is, that's really secant of x squared.

05:04:10.940 --> 05:04:17.940
So actually our inside function is the secant of x. The outside function is that we're squaring

05:04:19.220 --> 05:04:26.220
it. So we're going to take the derivative of the outside times the derivative of the inside

05:04:26.820 --> 05:04:33.820
the outside function is that we're squaring it. So if we're squaring it, we know we bring

05:04:36.500 --> 05:04:43.500
for f prime of x, we bring the exponent out front, and then reduce the exponent by 1.

05:04:47.060 --> 05:04:54.060
And we multiply by the derivative of the inside. The derivative of secant is secant

05:04:55.060 --> 05:05:02.060
tangent. Just to clean this up a bit, secant times secant is secant squared. So we have

05:05:05.660 --> 05:05:12.660
two secant squared x tangent x. And we've got r derivative. And then we're going to

05:05:24.660 --> 05:05:31.660
try another one. How about if we had f of x is equal to cosecant of 3x squared minus

05:05:40.620 --> 05:05:47.620
5x? Again, we've got a function inside of a function. Identifying what's inside of

05:05:54.060 --> 05:06:01.060
the inside is the 3x squared minus 5x. So we'll take the derivative of the outside times

05:06:03.820 --> 05:06:10.820
the derivative of the inside. And the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent.

05:06:12.340 --> 05:06:19.340
So we have f prime of x equals negative cosecant of the stuff 3x squared minus 5x times the

05:06:24.060 --> 05:06:31.060
cotangent of the stuff 3x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside. Well

05:06:36.060 --> 05:06:43.060
the derivative of the inside using our power rule is 6x minus 5. There's not much to clean

05:06:47.340 --> 05:06:52.980
up on this one. The only thing we might be able to do is move the 6x minus 5 to the front

05:06:53.000 --> 05:06:59.500
so it's really clear that that part is not part of the cotangent or cosecant. So we have

05:06:59.500 --> 05:07:06.500
negative 6x minus 5, don't lose the parenthesis, cosecant of 3x squared minus 5, cotangent

05:07:09.420 --> 05:07:16.420
of 3x squared minus 5. And we've found r derivative. And we've found r derivative.

05:07:23.980 --> 05:07:30.980
To make these a little more exciting, we can combine different rules together to find derivatives.

05:07:35.020 --> 05:07:42.020
Number 6 is an example of this, where we have f of x equals 4x plus 5 cubed times 2x squared

05:07:45.020 --> 05:07:52.020
minus 6x plus 1 to the seventh power. This one is a little bit more complicated.

05:07:52.980 --> 05:07:59.980
This problem is going to combine the chain rule along with the product rule. So we see

05:08:02.100 --> 05:08:09.100
we're working with a product, but the product is of functions within functions. On the

05:08:10.020 --> 05:08:17.020
left side we see 4x plus 5 is inside the cube function. On the right side we see 2x squared

05:08:18.020 --> 05:08:25.020
minus 6x plus 1 is inside the seventh power function. So let's use our product rule along

05:08:35.540 --> 05:08:42.540
with our chain rule in order to find the derivative. The product rule says we take the derivative

05:08:43.540 --> 05:08:49.740
of the first part times the second part. So the derivative of the first part, we bring

05:08:49.740 --> 05:08:56.740
the exponent out front, 3 times 4x plus 5, reduce the exponent by 1, so it's squared.

05:08:59.540 --> 05:09:06.540
And then we multiply by the derivative of the inside, which is just 4. Then that's the

05:09:07.060 --> 05:09:14.060
derivative of the first part, we still need to multiply by the second part, 2x squared

05:09:15.820 --> 05:09:22.820
minus 6x plus 1 to the seventh power. Plus, now the product rule says we take the derivative

05:09:27.840 --> 05:09:34.840
of the second part times the first part. The second part is a chain rule again, we bring

05:09:35.000 --> 05:09:42.000
the 7 out front times 2x squared minus 6x plus 1. Now to the sixth power, because we've

05:09:43.960 --> 05:09:50.960
reduced the exponent by 1, times the derivative of the inside. The inside has a derivative

05:09:53.080 --> 05:10:00.080
of 4x minus 6, and that part is the derivative of the second part. We still have to multiply

05:10:05.480 --> 05:10:12.480
by the first part, which is 4x plus 5, cubed. From here, there's just a little bit of cleanup.

05:10:16.880 --> 05:10:23.880
I'm going to multiply 3 times 4 to get 12 times 4x plus 5 squared times 2x squared minus

05:10:25.760 --> 05:10:32.760
6x plus 1 to the seventh power. The second part doesn't really have any cleanup to do,

05:10:35.160 --> 05:10:42.160
so we'll just keep that all the same, 7 times 2x squared minus 6x plus 1 to the sixth power

05:10:42.240 --> 05:10:49.240
times 4x minus 6 times 4x plus 5 cubed. That big ugly thing is the derivative of our function.

05:10:49.240 --> 05:10:56.240
Notice to get that derivative, we had to combine both the chain rule and the product rule.

05:11:04.960 --> 05:11:10.320
We knew the product rule was the derivative of the first times the second, plus the derivative

05:11:10.320 --> 05:11:16.200
of the second times the first, but in order to take those derivatives in each of those

05:11:16.200 --> 05:11:22.560
parts, we had to use the chain rule, where we took the derivative of the outside times

05:11:22.560 --> 05:11:29.560
the derivative of the inside. We not only can combine the chain rule with other rules,

05:11:34.680 --> 05:11:41.680
we can combine the chain rule with the chain rule. If we've got functions inside of functions,

05:11:42.200 --> 05:11:48.700
we can just keep applying the chain rule, taking the derivative of the outside times the derivative

05:11:48.700 --> 05:11:53.940
of the inside, times the derivative of what's inside that, times the derivative of what's

05:11:53.940 --> 05:12:00.940
inside that, until we run out of things to take the derivative of. For our final example,

05:12:03.600 --> 05:12:10.600
if f of x is equal to the tangent cubed of 5x squared minus 7 times the derivative of

05:12:12.560 --> 05:12:19.560
x, what you'll see we have here, and maybe we should rewrite, remember tangent cubed

05:12:20.320 --> 05:12:27.320
means we really have the tangent of 5x squared minus 7 to the third power. So we've got

05:12:32.580 --> 05:12:39.580
a tangent inside of cubed, but then we've also got a 5x squared minus 7 times the derivative

05:12:41.960 --> 05:12:47.480
of 7 inside of the tangent, and those colors are overlapping, making it very difficult

05:12:47.480 --> 05:12:54.480
to see, but you get the idea. So we're going to first take the derivative of the outside

05:12:58.320 --> 05:13:05.320
function, which is cubed. So for the derivative of a cubed, we pull the 3 outside, and reduce

05:13:05.320 --> 05:13:12.320
the exponent by 1, now it's tangent squared of 5x squared minus 7. Then we take the derivative

05:13:19.980 --> 05:13:26.980
of the inside, well the derivative of tangent is the secant squared of the inside stuff,

05:13:26.980 --> 05:13:33.980
5x squared minus 7. But we're still not done, because we can take the derivative of the

05:13:38.620 --> 05:13:45.620
inside stuff, which is going to be the 5x squared minus 7, the derivative of that is

05:13:45.780 --> 05:13:52.780
just 10x. Cleaning up a little bit, 3 times 10 is 30, so f prime of x is equal to the

05:13:57.580 --> 05:14:04.580
30x tangent squared of 5x squared minus 7 times secant squared of 5x squared minus 7.

05:14:11.940 --> 05:14:18.940
And now we've got our derivative, which required us to use the chain rule on the chain rule,

05:14:19.940 --> 05:14:26.940
which all we do is just start peeling off layers, like peeling the layers off an onion,

05:14:26.940 --> 05:14:32.300
derivative of the outside, times the derivative of what's in that, times the derivative of

05:14:32.300 --> 05:14:39.300
what's in that, times the derivative of what's in that, until we finally reach the end.

05:14:40.020 --> 05:14:44.620
So that's the chain rule, the chain rule is we just keep taking derivatives and multiplying

05:14:44.620 --> 05:14:50.780
until we reach the far inside of our function. This video is a little bit shorter because

05:14:50.780 --> 05:14:56.940
it's going to give you time to practice this on your own before you come to class, and

05:14:56.940 --> 05:15:01.300
then we'll dive into it a little deeper in class and answer any questions. I'll look

05:15:01.300 --> 05:15:08.300
forward to seeing you then, so that we can work on the chain rule.

05:15:09.900 --> 05:15:14.420
As we continue to work with derivatives, we want to continue to expand the types of functions

05:15:14.420 --> 05:15:18.900
we can take the derivative of, and there's another one that we've missed, and that is

05:15:18.900 --> 05:15:25.900
the inverse trig functions. So the question we're going to answer is what are the derivatives

05:15:32.620 --> 05:15:39.620
of the inverse trig functions?

05:15:40.500 --> 05:15:47.500
And before we can actually answer the question about what are the derivatives of the inverse

05:15:48.060 --> 05:15:55.060
trig functions, we really have to understand how derivatives of inverses work.

05:16:01.980 --> 05:16:08.980
And there's a nice little theorem that says that if f inverse of x is equal to x, then

05:16:09.620 --> 05:16:16.620
is the inverse of f of x, then the derivative of f inverse at x is simply the reciprocal

05:16:29.020 --> 05:16:36.020
of the derivative at that inverse point. Maybe a better way to say that is the inverse

05:16:39.620 --> 05:16:46.620
point is to say that that's not so mathematical is if a comma b is a point on f of x, then

05:16:55.300 --> 05:17:02.300
the slope of the tangent line,

05:17:10.500 --> 05:17:17.500
is f prime of a. We stick that x coordinate into the derivative. We already know that

05:17:17.700 --> 05:17:21.980
though, that's just our basic definition of the slope of a tangent line that we've been

05:17:21.980 --> 05:17:28.980
working with thus far. So if a b is a point on f of x, then b comma a, switching the x

05:17:30.900 --> 05:17:37.900
and y coordinates, is on f inverse of x, and the slope is on f inverse of x, and the slope

05:17:39.620 --> 05:17:46.620
of the tangent line is, and it turns out to be, just the reciprocal of the slope of the

05:17:54.020 --> 05:18:01.020
standard function. So the slope of the inverse is the reciprocal of the slope of the function.

05:18:01.300 --> 05:18:08.300
We'll say 1 over f prime of a, and that's probably an important slope of the slope of

05:18:09.820 --> 05:18:16.820
the slope to know 1 over the derivative at that point. So let's take a look at how we

05:18:19.020 --> 05:18:26.020
can do some of these reciprocals of slopes or derivatives to calculate some tangent lines

05:18:30.740 --> 05:18:37.740
on inverse functions. So for example, we're going to find the equation for the slope of

05:18:39.620 --> 05:18:47.040
a tangent line of the inverse of f of x equals x cubed minus 7x plus 5 at 5.

05:19:10.620 --> 05:19:17.620
So we're going to break this down into three parts. First, it's really important as we're

05:19:21.580 --> 05:19:27.900
talking about this, we keep track of our five, is that the x coordinate or the y coordinate

05:19:27.900 --> 05:19:32.260
of the function or of the inverse, because the function and the inverse have the same

05:19:32.260 --> 05:19:36.420
x and y coordinates, they're just switched and backwards, and it's really easy to get

05:19:36.420 --> 05:19:43.420
those confused. So let's take a moment to really clearly say that 5 is the x coordinate

05:19:45.140 --> 05:19:52.140
of the inverse. We're finding the equation of the tangent line of the inverse at 5. So

05:19:56.380 --> 05:20:03.380
5 is the x coordinate of the inverse, which means it is the y or the f of x for the ratio

05:20:06.660 --> 05:20:13.660
function. Maybe I should say y for the f of x. So it's the x of the inverse and it's

05:20:14.580 --> 05:20:21.580
the y for the function, which means we need to still find the other coordinate, the x

05:20:25.700 --> 05:20:32.700
of the f of x. So if f of x is x cubed minus 7x plus 5, then we're going to find the x

05:20:36.420 --> 05:20:43.420
of 5, and 5 is that y coordinate, this is like saying it equals 5. And we can solve this

05:20:45.940 --> 05:20:52.940
really quickly for x. We'll subtract 5 from both sides to make it equal to 0, x cubed

05:20:53.140 --> 05:21:00.140
minus 7x equals 0, factoring out the x from both sides, and then subtracting out the x

05:21:07.420 --> 05:21:14.420
of both terms, we get x squared minus 7 equals 0. Let's scroll down a little more here, give

05:21:17.380 --> 05:21:23.380
me some more space. And we'll set each factor equal to 0, so x equals 0, and x squared minus

05:21:23.380 --> 05:21:30.380
7 equals 0. So x is equal to plus or minus the square root of 7. So we've got three

05:21:30.580 --> 05:21:37.580
possible values for our x coordinate to make the y coordinate 5, 0, square root of 7, or

05:21:39.660 --> 05:21:46.660
negative square root of 7. In fact, let's clearly state that on f of x, the point we're

05:21:50.420 --> 05:21:57.420
talking about is 0, 5, square root of 7, 5, and negative square root of 7, 5, and negative

05:21:57.420 --> 05:22:04.420
square root of 7, 5. We've got three points, which means on the inverse, we're talking

05:22:06.180 --> 05:22:13.180
about the opposites, 5, 0, 5, square root of 7, and 5, negative square root of 7. Keeping

05:22:15.340 --> 05:22:22.340
track of what's x, what's y on which function. Probably the most challenging part of this

05:22:23.340 --> 05:22:29.820
section is keeping track of what is what. Next thing we're ready to do is, now that we

05:22:29.820 --> 05:22:34.620
know what our x and y coordinates are that we're working with, we still need to find

05:22:34.620 --> 05:22:41.620
the slope of the tangent line of f of x, because we know that the slope of the tangent line

05:22:42.020 --> 05:22:49.020
of the inverse is just the reciprocal of this slope. Just because it's off my screen,

05:22:50.020 --> 05:22:57.020
I'm going to write the function again x cubed minus 7x plus 5, so that we can take the derivative

05:22:58.140 --> 05:23:05.140
at 3x squared minus 7. We need to find the slope at each of the three points, at each

05:23:05.140 --> 05:23:12.140
of the three x coordinates that we just found. We're going to find f prime of 0, f prime

05:23:18.980 --> 05:23:25.980
of the square root of 7, and f prime of negative square root of 7. We're going to have 3 because

05:23:26.020 --> 05:23:29.680
we're dealing with three points. I think the homework assignment specifies a specific

05:23:29.680 --> 05:23:34.600
range, so you're only doing one of the points, but the process is the same. Let's take the

05:23:34.620 --> 05:23:40.500
extra practice. First, plugging 0 into the derivative, we have 3 times 0 squared minus

05:23:40.500 --> 05:23:47.500
7, and that's just going to equal negative 7. Plugging square root of 7 in, we've got

05:23:49.240 --> 05:23:56.240
3 times the square root of 7 squared minus 7. That's 3 times 7, or 21 minus 7, and that's

05:23:57.080 --> 05:24:03.200
equal to 14. Really similar with the negative square root of 7, because squaring a negative

05:24:03.200 --> 05:24:10.200
is the same as squaring the positive, so we've got 3 times 7, or 21 minus 7 is 14. Now we can make the equations of the tangent line.

05:24:33.200 --> 05:24:40.200
Remember, with f inverse, we have to switch coordinates, because x is y and y is x on the inverse. We

05:24:55.320 --> 05:25:02.320
also have to do the reciprocal slopes. We're going to have to do the reciprocal slope.

05:25:03.640 --> 05:25:10.640
For our first point, let's see if I can get the points on the screen here. On the inverse,

05:25:13.460 --> 05:25:20.460
the first point was 5 comma 0, and at that point we found the slope was equal to negative

05:25:21.500 --> 05:25:28.500
1 seventh, the reciprocal of the negative 7. We have y equals negative 1 seventh times

05:25:29.100 --> 05:25:36.100
x minus 5 plus the 0. That's the equation of the tangent line at 5-0. What if we wanted

05:25:41.060 --> 05:25:47.060
to do it at 5 square root of 7? Actually, let's do this in a different color, just to

05:25:47.060 --> 05:25:53.020
keep the different colors separate. Second point was 5 square root of 7. There the slope

05:25:53.020 --> 05:26:00.020
is the reciprocal of 14, or 1 over 14. We have y equals 1 14th times x minus 5 plus

05:26:04.300 --> 05:26:11.300
the square root of 7. We had a third point. Our third point was at 5 comma negative square

05:26:14.220 --> 05:26:21.220
root of 7. That slope is going to be the reciprocal of 14, which is 1 over 14. For that equation,

05:26:23.340 --> 05:26:30.340
we've got y equals 1 14th times x minus 5 minus the square root of 7.

05:26:33.420 --> 05:26:39.300
Now we've got our three tangent lines that are tangent at an x coordinate of 5 to paint

05:26:39.300 --> 05:26:43.380
on the y coordinate, because this inverse isn't actually a function. We probably should

05:26:43.380 --> 05:26:48.100
have restricted the domain, but it provided us the chance to practice three times with

05:26:48.180 --> 05:26:55.180
this process of finding the slope of the tangent line to the function, knowing the inverse

05:26:56.900 --> 05:27:03.900
is the reciprocal slope. Let's try one more example that uses this idea before we get

05:27:04.740 --> 05:27:11.740
to trig. How about this example? The point 4 comma 1 is 4 comma 1 minus 4 over 4.

05:27:18.240 --> 05:27:29.240
It is on the inverse of f of x equals x to the 5th minus 3x squared plus 4 squared.

05:27:29.240 --> 05:27:36.380
Find the equation of the tangent line. We know that the tangent line is going to have

05:27:59.540 --> 05:28:06.540
the reciprocal slope of the function's tangent line slope. Let's find the function's tangent

05:28:07.040 --> 05:28:12.160
line slope, f prime of x equals, this is a chain rule here. We'll take the derivative

05:28:12.160 --> 05:28:19.160
of the outside, which is 2 times x to the 5th minus 3x squared plus 4 times the derivative

05:28:19.920 --> 05:28:26.920
of the inside, which is 5x to the 4th minus 6x. Remember, 4 1 is on the inverse of x

05:28:29.240 --> 05:28:36.240
to the 5th minus 6x. The point we want that's on the standard function before the inverse

05:28:37.160 --> 05:28:44.160
is actually reversed. It's actually 1 comma 4. We want to make our x equal to 1 because

05:28:44.760 --> 05:28:51.760
we're dealing with the standard function, not its inverse. F prime of 1 is equal to 2 times

05:28:52.040 --> 05:28:59.040
1 to the 5th minus 3 times 1 squared plus 4 times 5 times 1 to the 4th minus 5 times

05:28:59.640 --> 05:29:06.640
6 times 1. Maybe use a calculator to do that real quick.

05:29:09.600 --> 05:29:14.080
1 is nice because it's not going to do anything exciting when we multiply it or when we do

05:29:14.080 --> 05:29:21.080
exponents with it. We've got 2 times 1 to the 5th, which is just 1 minus 3 times 1 squared,

05:29:21.480 --> 05:29:28.080
which is just 3 plus 4. Close the parentheses, then we have 5 times 1 to the 4th, which is

05:29:28.080 --> 05:29:35.080
just 5 minus 6 times 1, which is just 6. We get this nice slope of negative 4.

05:29:44.880 --> 05:29:51.880
If that's the slope of the function at 1, the slope at the inverse, at the alternative

05:29:52.320 --> 05:29:59.320
coordinates, the slope of the inverse that we're going for is negative 1 fourth, and

05:30:01.440 --> 05:30:07.360
the point we're working with is 4 comma 1. We just go straight to our equation, y equals

05:30:07.360 --> 05:30:14.360
negative 1 fourth times x minus 4 plus 1. That's going to go through the point 4, 1.

05:30:14.880 --> 05:30:21.880
It's on the inverse of its tangent to the inverse of our function.

05:30:28.240 --> 05:30:32.040
But the original question that we're dealing with had to do with the inverse of the trig

05:30:32.040 --> 05:30:38.760
functions, so we haven't touched any trig functions yet. Let's see if we can use what

05:30:38.840 --> 05:30:45.840
we've just learned about inverses to find the derivatives of the inverse trig functions.

05:30:53.880 --> 05:31:00.880
To set this up, I want to consider f of x equals sine x. If we want the inverse of

05:31:00.880 --> 05:31:07.880
sine x, we remember from our trig days, we call that just the sine inverse of x, and

05:31:09.080 --> 05:31:16.080
it's really important to note that that negative 1 is not an exponent. It's not an exponent.

05:31:18.640 --> 05:31:25.640
That doesn't mean sine to the negative 1 power. That means the inverse sine of x. It might

05:31:26.640 --> 05:31:33.640
be called the arc sine of x. Using what we know, then what we know about inverses is

05:31:36.760 --> 05:31:41.960
we can find the derivative of the inverse using the derivative of the standard function.

05:31:41.960 --> 05:31:48.760
The derivative of the standard function, f prime of x, the derivative of sine is cosine

05:31:48.760 --> 05:31:55.760
of x. And we know that the derivative of an inverse is equal to 1 over the derivative

05:32:06.100 --> 05:32:13.100
of the functions inverse. So in our case, that's going to be 1 over f prime. The derivative

05:32:14.080 --> 05:32:21.080
is cosine of the inverse function, which is sine inverse of x. And if we think back to

05:32:31.140 --> 05:32:37.640
our trig days, we remember to find sine inverse of x. We say, hey, well, we've got a triangle,

05:32:37.640 --> 05:32:44.440
cosine of the sine inverse. We've got a triangle. We like to make the radius equal to 1. And

05:32:44.440 --> 05:32:51.440
we want the sine inverse of x. So sine inverse of x. So we're talking about x. So the opposite

05:32:54.760 --> 05:33:01.760
over the hypotenuse is the sine. Opposite over the hypotenuse is x. So x over 1 is x.

05:33:02.760 --> 05:33:08.840
And then using the Pythagorean theorem, the other side has to be 1 minus x squared, the

05:33:08.840 --> 05:33:15.840
square root of all of that. So that's our triangle for the sine inverse of x. We want

05:33:17.760 --> 05:33:24.760
to take the cosine of that. And cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. The adjacent over

05:33:25.760 --> 05:33:31.760
the hypotenuse, in this case, is the square root over 1, which is just the square root.

05:33:31.760 --> 05:33:38.760
And so we end up with 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared. 1 over the square root

05:33:44.560 --> 05:33:51.560
of 1 minus x squared, then, is the derivative of the inverse sine. And so we end up with

05:33:55.480 --> 05:34:02.480
using this exact same process, we can actually find the derivative of all the inverse sine

05:34:04.200 --> 05:34:11.200
function, or inverse trig functions. So similarly, we get the derivatives of the inverse trig

05:34:11.200 --> 05:34:18.200
functions. We get the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. Six inverse trig functions.

05:34:33.920 --> 05:34:40.840
The derivative of sine inverse of x, we just found out that that was 1 over the square

05:34:40.880 --> 05:34:47.880
root of 1 minus x squared. Similarly, the derivative of cosine inverse of x turns out

05:34:52.120 --> 05:34:59.120
to be negative 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared. And the derivative of tangent

05:35:01.920 --> 05:35:08.920
inverse of x, using the same process, will be 1 over 1 plus x squared. And so we get

05:35:11.320 --> 05:35:18.320
and then we can find the derivative of the reciprocals. The reciprocal of sine is cosecant.

05:35:19.920 --> 05:35:26.120
Its derivative is negative 1 over the absolute value of x times the square root of x squared

05:35:26.120 --> 05:35:33.120
minus 1. The derivative of secant inverse of x is 1 over the absolute value of x times

05:35:34.100 --> 05:35:41.100
the square root of x squared minus 1. And the derivative of cotangent inverse of x is

05:35:51.400 --> 05:35:58.400
negative 1 over 1 plus x squared. So you've got six more important derivatives.

05:36:04.120 --> 05:36:11.120
To add to your list of derivatives. Nice part about these is if you know your trig

05:36:13.760 --> 05:36:17.440
well enough, you should be able to derive them all using our inverse formula that we

05:36:17.440 --> 05:36:24.440
just found. Or you can memorize them, which comes quite naturally out of just trying a

05:36:25.880 --> 05:36:31.980
few of these over and over again in practice. So let's do just that. Let's do two examples

05:36:31.980 --> 05:36:38.980
where we're finding the derivatives of the inverse trig functions. Let's say f of x equals

05:36:45.140 --> 05:36:52.140
the cosine inverse of x squared. We're dealing with a chain rule here. We've got x squared

05:36:52.140 --> 05:36:59.140
inside the cosine inverse. So let's see how that comes out. The derivative of cosine inverse

05:36:59.540 --> 05:37:06.540
is negative 1 over the square root of 1 minus x squared. But x squared is in there, so we've

05:37:08.540 --> 05:37:15.540
got x squared squared. x squared squared is x to the fourth. Knowing that we multiply

05:37:15.540 --> 05:37:22.540
those exponents times the derivative of the inside. The derivative of x squared is 2x.

05:37:23.540 --> 05:37:30.540
And since that's really 2x over 1, we can simplify to get negative 2x over the square

05:37:30.860 --> 05:37:37.860
root of 1 minus x to the fourth. So we've got x squared times the derivative of x squared

05:37:46.540 --> 05:37:53.540
Let's try another one. Let's say f of x equals the square root of x times the secant inverse

05:37:59.420 --> 05:38:06.420
of x. By this point in our study of calculus, when we see that square root of x, we should

05:38:06.420 --> 05:38:13.420
immediately know to change that to x to the one half power so that we can use our exponent

05:38:13.780 --> 05:38:20.780
properties. So we have x to the one half secant inverse of x. And let's start taking the derivative

05:38:22.460 --> 05:38:28.460
using the product rule because we're dealing with a product. So the derivative of the first

05:38:28.820 --> 05:38:35.820
is one half times x to the negative one half times the second, which is secant inverse

05:38:37.140 --> 05:38:44.140
of x. Plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative of secant inverse is 1 over

05:38:46.100 --> 05:38:52.600
the absolute value of x times the square root of x squared minus 1. So we're going to

05:38:52.600 --> 05:38:59.600
use 1 over the absolute value of x times the square root of x squared minus 1 times the

05:39:01.000 --> 05:39:08.000
first, which is x to the one half. Let's clean that up a little bit. Let's go ahead

05:39:09.040 --> 05:39:15.040
and use our negative exponents. The one half means we've got a 2 in the denominator, x

05:39:15.040 --> 05:39:20.280
to the one half sticks the square root of x in the denominator. Now be careful with secant

05:39:20.280 --> 05:39:25.640
inverse. That is not secant to the negative one power. That is not a negative exponent.

05:39:25.640 --> 05:39:32.240
That's an inverse trig function. So we'll put the secant inverse of x in the numerator.

05:39:32.240 --> 05:39:37.740
Plus x to the one half, that's really the square root of x in the numerator. Absolute

05:39:37.740 --> 05:39:44.740
value of x times the square root of x squared minus 1. And now we've got the derivative

05:39:45.120 --> 05:39:52.120
of that function. So we did a little bit of work today with inverse functions, but the

05:39:53.200 --> 05:39:58.200
big idea that I want you to be able to pull out of this lesson is how to take the derivative

05:39:58.200 --> 05:40:03.700
of the inverse functions using these six derivative properties. We'll also do a little bit of

05:40:03.700 --> 05:40:09.700
work with inverses in general, but the bulk is going to be here on the trig derivatives.

05:40:10.080 --> 05:40:17.080
Practice a few of these. We will see you in class to dive into them a little bit deeper.

05:40:17.080 --> 05:40:23.080
Now that we're able to use the chain rule in order to calculate more complex derivatives,

05:40:23.080 --> 05:40:29.080
we are actually ready to answer a deeper question about finding derivatives. And that's for

05:40:29.080 --> 05:40:35.080
finding derivatives around functions, or not functions, but relations between x and y that

05:40:35.280 --> 05:40:42.580
are more complex than a function. This would include things like circles, ellipses, hyperbolas,

05:40:42.580 --> 05:40:49.580
or more complex graphs and non-functions that do not pass the vertical line test. So the

05:40:49.880 --> 05:40:56.880
question is going to be how do we take the derivative of x squared minus 1 over x squared

05:41:05.260 --> 05:41:12.260
if it is not a function of x? In other words, it's going to fail the vertical line test.

05:41:16.400 --> 05:41:21.060
It's not a function, and everything we've done thus far has been all predicated on the

05:41:21.060 --> 05:41:26.820
idea of a function. And so what we're going to have to do is if it's not a function, we're

05:41:26.820 --> 05:41:33.820
going to have to use what's called implicit differentiation. And so we're going to have

05:41:35.580 --> 05:41:42.580
a function where y is a function of x, we don't know what it is, or it's too complex for

05:41:47.240 --> 05:41:54.240
us to work with, and so we'll just take the derivative of y times the derivative of what's

05:41:54.900 --> 05:42:01.900
inside it, and the derivative of y we know is just dy dx. So in summary, we can use the

05:42:05.080 --> 05:42:12.080
chain rule with this idea that the derivative of y with respect to x is dy dx. But of course

05:42:24.020 --> 05:42:29.840
dy dx is what we're trying to find. What is the derivative of y with respect to x? And

05:42:29.840 --> 05:42:36.840
so what we will then do is we will then solve for dy dx, and generally dy dx will be a linear

05:42:43.520 --> 05:42:49.520
function so we'll be able to get all the dy dx's on one side, factor out dy dx, and divide

05:42:49.520 --> 05:42:55.200
by whatever it's multiplied by. But to get an idea of what this looks like, let's start

05:42:55.200 --> 05:43:02.200
with a simple example. Just a basic circle with a radius of six has the equation x squared

05:43:02.800 --> 05:43:10.300
plus y squared equals 36. And just kind of to draw a picture off to the side, we won't

05:43:10.300 --> 05:43:13.460
normally do this, but just to get an idea of what we're talking about here is we've

05:43:13.460 --> 05:43:20.460
got a circle with a radius of six, and the idea is that we could in theory calculate

05:43:25.200 --> 05:43:30.720
we come up with a tangent line to this circle that touches at one point, and we could put

05:43:30.720 --> 05:43:37.720
that tangent line anywhere on the circle. And so what we want to do is come up with

05:43:37.720 --> 05:43:44.720
what is the equation of the slope of that tangent line? What is dy dx? But we can't

05:43:44.720 --> 05:43:49.340
do it by our traditional means because this thing is not a function. It does not pass

05:43:49.340 --> 05:43:56.080
the vertical line test because it's going to, a vertical line will cross the graph twice.

05:43:56.080 --> 05:44:01.180
So because it doesn't pass the vertical line test, because it's not a function, we will

05:44:01.180 --> 05:44:06.140
take the derivative implicitly, which means we're going to use this idea of the chain

05:44:06.140 --> 05:44:13.140
rule whenever we come across the y. So first, the derivative of x squared is 2x, plus the

05:44:13.420 --> 05:44:20.920
derivative of y squared. Now keep it in mind the chain rule, we're going to treat the y

05:44:20.920 --> 05:44:27.920
like it's the inside stuff, and so the derivative of y squared is 2y, but we have to multiply

05:44:30.140 --> 05:44:37.140
by the derivative of the inside, and the derivative of y is dy dx. Equals, we'll do the same thing

05:44:37.140 --> 05:44:44.140
on the other side, the derivative of 36 is 0, and now I've got something that I can

05:44:46.020 --> 05:44:53.020
solve for the dy dx. To solve for the dy dx, we'll subtract 2x from both sides, and we

05:44:55.540 --> 05:45:02.540
have 2y dy dx equals negative 2x. Get the y by itself, or the dy dx, and we're going

05:45:07.140 --> 05:45:14.140
to get dy dx by itself, by dividing by 2y, and we get negative 2x over 2y, or by reducing

05:45:16.300 --> 05:45:23.300
out the 2s, we have dy dx is equal to negative x over y. So the slope of the tangent line

05:45:27.220 --> 05:45:34.220
of this circle is negative x over y. We would then know from our point what x and y are,

05:45:35.220 --> 05:45:42.220
and we'd be able to find the slope at any given point. Now that was a simple example.

05:45:42.780 --> 05:45:48.780
These examples can quickly increase in complexity as we combine quotient rules and product rules

05:45:48.780 --> 05:45:55.660
and chain rules and all the other rules we've seen. So let's try several of these examples.

05:45:55.660 --> 05:45:59.660
We'll do two more examples where we're just solving for dy dx, and then we'll also look

05:45:59.780 --> 05:46:06.280
at how we can find the equation of these tangent lines. So first we're going to look at x cubed

05:46:06.280 --> 05:46:13.280
y squared minus the sine of x equals the tangent of y. To take the derivative implicitly,

05:46:19.620 --> 05:46:23.780
because solving for y would be a headache, we'll take the derivative of the first part

05:46:23.780 --> 05:46:29.820
here. We notice we've got a product, the x squared times the y squared, so we will use

05:46:29.820 --> 05:46:36.820
the product rule. The derivative of x cubed is 3x squared times the second part, which

05:46:36.820 --> 05:46:43.820
is y squared, plus the derivative of the second part, which is 2y dy dx, and I'll just put

05:46:44.900 --> 05:46:50.180
that in parentheses so we can see what we're solving for, times the first part, which is

05:46:50.220 --> 05:46:57.220
x cubed. Now that we've used the product rule, we keep going down our function. The derivative

05:46:57.940 --> 05:47:04.940
of negative sine is negative cosine of x equals the derivative of tangent is secant square

05:47:06.740 --> 05:47:13.340
of y, but times the derivative of the inside, whenever we take the derivative with the y,

05:47:13.420 --> 05:47:20.420
we have to multiply by dy dx. Now we just have to solve for the dy dx. To do that, we're

05:47:26.020 --> 05:47:32.020
going to get all the dy dx's on one side, so I'm going to move that 2y dy dx, that's

05:47:32.020 --> 05:47:38.940
a terrible y, the 2y dy dx times x cubed, we're going to move that to the left side,

05:47:38.940 --> 05:47:45.940
so we now have 3x squared, it should be green, 3x squared y squared minus the cosine of x

05:47:49.100 --> 05:47:56.100
equals the secant squared of y times dy dx, minus 2y x cubed times the dy dx, and then

05:47:56.100 --> 05:48:03.100
because the dy dx is on both terms, we're able to factor that out, dy dx times the secant

05:48:03.900 --> 05:48:10.900
squared of y minus 2y x cubed, is still equal to, the other side's unchanged, 3x squared

05:48:13.060 --> 05:48:20.060
y squared minus 2y x cubed, that's a terrible y, that's a terrible y, that's a terrible

05:48:26.140 --> 05:48:33.140
cosine x. And so to get the dy dx alone, we just divide by everything, it's multiplied

05:48:36.220 --> 05:48:43.060
by, and so now we can say that dy dx, the derivative or slope of the tangent line of

05:48:43.060 --> 05:48:50.060
this relationship is 3x squared y squared minus cosine x divided by what was multiplied

05:48:50.980 --> 05:48:57.980
by the dy dx, the secant squared y minus 2y x cubed, and that's how we can use this

05:49:03.740 --> 05:49:10.060
idea of implicit differentiation, we just keep taking the derivative of both sides, and

05:49:10.060 --> 05:49:16.340
then whenever we come across a y, we're going to multiply by the derivative of y using the

05:49:16.340 --> 05:49:23.620
chain rule, which is dy dx. Let's look at another. Let's say we have xy plus x over y equals

05:49:34.140 --> 05:49:41.140
y times the square root of 2x plus 1. One thing that's going to help us make this derivative

05:49:46.420 --> 05:49:53.620
a little easier is the x over y, we can rewrite that y with a negative exponent, so we can

05:49:53.620 --> 05:49:58.860
just use the product rule instead of the quotient rule, which is much simpler. Also the square

05:49:58.860 --> 05:50:03.780
root, the easiest way to take a derivative with the square root is to change that to

05:50:03.780 --> 05:50:09.700
a fractional exponent of 1 half, and then we can just use our exponent rules. So let's

05:50:09.700 --> 05:50:16.700
rewrite this problem as xy plus xy to the negative 1 equals y times 2x plus 1 to the

05:50:21.020 --> 05:50:28.020
1 half power. Now we're going to have to use several product rules here, so you want

05:50:29.300 --> 05:50:34.660
to make sure you keep track of each part because we've got a product at the beginning, actually

05:50:34.660 --> 05:50:40.340
let me do this in green so it stands out a little more. A product at the beginning,

05:50:40.340 --> 05:50:45.180
a product in the middle, and a product at the end which is going to require us to use

05:50:45.180 --> 05:50:52.180
the chain rule. So the first product, x times y, derivative of the first, the derivative

05:50:52.860 --> 05:50:59.860
of x is 1 times y plus the derivative of the second, the derivative of y is dy dx times

05:51:00.860 --> 05:51:07.860
the first, which is x, plus the derivative of x is 1 times the second, y to the negative

05:51:12.380 --> 05:51:19.380
1 plus the derivative of the second, the derivative of y to the negative 1. We bring the negative

05:51:19.500 --> 05:51:26.500
out front, so instead of plus we actually have minus y to the negative 2 times dy dx,

05:51:30.140 --> 05:51:37.140
because we were taking a derivative with y times the first, which is x, equals, we have

05:51:41.260 --> 05:51:48.260
another product. The derivative of the first part, the derivative of y is dy dx times the

05:51:48.620 --> 05:51:55.620
second part, which is 2x plus 1 to the 1 half plus the derivative of the second part, which

05:51:56.220 --> 05:52:03.220
is 1 half times 2x plus 1 to the negative 1 half. But now we have to use our chain rule

05:52:07.380 --> 05:52:14.380
because the derivative of the 2x plus 1, the inside stuff, is 2. Now we can multiply

05:52:16.020 --> 05:52:23.020
by the derivative, by the first part. Looking at this ugly thing that we have, a couple

05:52:23.220 --> 05:52:30.140
of things to simplify, we've got a times 2 and a divide by 2, those are going to reduce

05:52:30.140 --> 05:52:36.300
out, which is nice, so we don't have to deal with the fraction. Other than that, what we're

05:52:36.300 --> 05:52:43.300
going to want to do is get all of these dy dx terms, there's one right here, dy dx times

05:52:44.740 --> 05:52:51.740
x, we've got a negative y to the negative 2, dy dx times x, and we've also got x to

05:52:53.020 --> 05:53:00.020
a dy dx multiplied by the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half. Let's move all the dy dx's to the

05:53:03.940 --> 05:53:10.940
right and everything else to the left. So on the left we've still got the y plus y to

05:53:12.460 --> 05:53:19.460
the negative 1, and then we'll subtract out that term at the end, the 2x plus 1 to the

05:53:19.820 --> 05:53:26.820
negative 1 half times y, and I'm just going to put that y in front, equals, we've got

05:53:33.060 --> 05:53:40.060
a dy dx multiplied by the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half. We have to also subtract off the dy

05:53:41.060 --> 05:53:48.060
dx, which is multiplied by the x, and we're also going to add, to get rid of the minus,

05:53:53.900 --> 05:54:00.900
a y to the negative 2x times dy dx. Now that we've got the dy dx's on the right,

05:54:00.900 --> 05:54:07.900
the everything else on the left, we can factor out the dy dx, which leaves us with 2x plus

05:54:18.340 --> 05:54:25.340
1 to the 1 half minus x plus y to the negative 2x. The other side's unchanged, y plus y

05:54:30.900 --> 05:54:37.900
to the negative 1 minus y times 2x plus 1 to the negative 1 half. That's a terrible

05:54:42.020 --> 05:54:49.020
2. There we go. And then finally we get the dy dx alone by dividing both sides by what

05:54:49.260 --> 05:54:56.020
it's multiplied by, giving us y plus y to the negative 1 minus y times 2x plus 1 to the

05:54:56.020 --> 05:55:03.020
negative 1 half, all over the 2x plus 1 to the 1 half, minus x plus y to the negative

05:55:11.860 --> 05:55:18.860
2 times x. And now we have implicitly found that we've

05:55:19.020 --> 05:55:26.020
found our derivative. Keeping along with this same idea, I want to add to it a little twist,

05:55:31.540 --> 05:55:38.540
something we're very familiar with. And that is finding the equation of the tangent line.

05:55:50.020 --> 05:55:57.020
So that equation of the tangent line, same idea, let's start with x cubed y plus 5x

05:56:01.940 --> 05:56:08.940
squared y equals negative 28. And we're going to find the equation of the tangent line at

05:56:08.940 --> 05:56:15.940
the point 2 comma negative 1. First we need to find the slope of the tangent line, and

05:56:19.020 --> 05:56:23.780
then it's going to be really easy to find the actual equation. To find the slope we

05:56:23.780 --> 05:56:28.620
take the derivative, we've got a couple products, we're getting really good at the product rule

05:56:28.620 --> 05:56:35.620
here. So we've got 3x squared times y plus the derivative of y is dy dx times the x cubed

05:56:41.380 --> 05:56:48.380
plus, for the second product, the derivative of the first part is 10x times the y plus

05:56:49.020 --> 05:56:56.020
the derivative of the second, which is a dy dx times the first part, which is 5x squared

05:56:57.740 --> 05:57:04.740
equals the derivative of negative 28 is just 0. Now solving for the dy dx's, they're all

05:57:08.220 --> 05:57:13.420
on one side, which is nice, so we just need to get rid of the other stuff. So we've got

05:57:13.420 --> 05:57:20.420
a dy dx times x cubed plus a dy dx times 5x squared is equal to negative 3x squared

05:57:25.740 --> 05:57:32.740
y minus 10xy, moving those things without dy dx to the other side, so that we can factor

05:57:35.620 --> 05:57:42.620
out the dy dx, leaving behind x cubed plus 5x squared plus 5x squared plus 5x squared

05:57:43.660 --> 05:57:50.660
equals the negative 3x squared y minus 10xy. Now we can divide by what dy dx is multiplied

05:57:56.500 --> 05:58:03.500
by, so we know that dy dx is equal to negative 3x squared y minus 10xy over the x cubed

05:58:04.500 --> 05:58:11.500
plus 5x squared. We want that derivative at the point 2 comma negative 1, so we'll plug

05:58:20.500 --> 05:58:26.500
2 in for all of these x's, we'll plug negative 1 in for the y's, so we have negative 3 times

05:58:26.500 --> 05:58:33.500
x, which is 2 squared times y, which is negative 1, minus 10 times x, which is 2 times y, which

05:58:35.900 --> 05:58:42.900
is negative 1, all over x cubed, x is 2 cubed plus 5x squared, which is 2 squared, and this

05:58:47.980 --> 05:58:54.980
is not too bad to plug in to our handy dandy calculators. Let's just do the numerator and

05:58:55.980 --> 05:59:01.980
the denominator, so it's a fraction and it looks kind of slope-esque. We've got negative

05:59:01.980 --> 05:59:08.980
3 times 2 squared times negative 1 minus 10 times 2 times negative 1, so the numerator

05:59:17.540 --> 05:59:24.540
is 32, over our denominator, which is 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2 times 2

05:59:25.780 --> 05:59:32.780
cubed plus 5 times 2 squared, which is 28. Both of those are divisible by 4, 32 divided

05:59:39.540 --> 05:59:46.540
by 4 is 8 and 28 divided by 4 is 7, so 8 sevenths is equal to our slope at the point 2 comma

05:59:46.820 --> 05:59:53.820
negative 1. So the equation of the tangent line, y equals m, my slope 8 sevenths times

06:00:03.100 --> 06:00:10.100
x minus x1, which is 2, plus the y1, which is negative 1, the equation of our tangent

06:00:11.020 --> 06:00:18.020
line, of this ugly function is 8 sevenths x minus 2 minus 1. Let's do one more example,

06:00:24.860 --> 06:00:31.860
it's got a trig function in it. Number 2, cosine of x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x, y, x,

06:00:40.660 --> 06:00:47.660
y equals y. And we're going to find the equation of the tangent line at pi over 3 comma 1.

06:00:55.780 --> 06:00:59.620
We'll do this implicitly because it's almost impossible to solve for y, at least it would

06:00:59.620 --> 06:01:06.620
be quite tedious. So the derivative of cosine is negative sine of x, y. Using the chain

06:01:07.620 --> 06:01:14.620
rule, we multiply by the derivative of what's inside. We want to make sure we multiply by

06:01:14.620 --> 06:01:18.620
the entire derivative, and because we have to use the product rule, there's going to

06:01:18.620 --> 06:01:25.020
be a plus, so I'm going to put this in parentheses to remind me to distribute the negative sine

06:01:25.020 --> 06:01:32.020
through the parentheses. The derivative of x is just 1 times the y, which is y, plus

06:01:32.520 --> 06:01:39.520
the derivative of y is our dy dx times the x, and that's equal to the derivative of y,

06:01:46.300 --> 06:01:53.300
which we know is dy dx. We want to solve for the dy dx, we first have to get it out of

06:01:53.540 --> 06:01:59.540
the parentheses, so we're going to distribute that negative sine x, y through. That gives

06:01:59.540 --> 06:02:06.540
us negative y sine of x, y minus x sine of x, y times dy dx equals dy dx. We want to get

06:02:06.540 --> 06:02:13.540
the dy dx's all on the same side, so we'll add that x sine x y to both sides, giving

06:02:27.760 --> 06:02:34.760
us negative y sine of x, y equals dy dx, y minus x sine of x, y minus x sine of x, y

06:02:37.540 --> 06:02:44.540
plus x sine of x, y, dy dx. Once they're all on one side, we can factor out dy dx, leaving

06:02:57.500 --> 06:03:04.500
behind a 1, don't forget the 1, it doesn't just disappear, plus x sine of x, y plus

06:03:07.540 --> 06:03:14.540
y, still equal to negative y sine of x, y. Finally, to get the dy dx alone, we divide

06:03:17.660 --> 06:03:24.160
both sides by what it's multiplied to get our final derivative, negative y sine of x,

06:03:24.160 --> 06:03:31.160
y, divided by 1 plus x sine of x, y equals dy dx. We're going to divide both sides by

06:03:37.100 --> 06:03:44.100
dy dx. We want the slope though, or we want the equation, at pi over 3 comma 1. Let's

06:03:46.100 --> 06:03:52.600
plug that into our function. We got negative y, which is negative 1, times the sine of

06:03:52.600 --> 06:03:59.600
x times y, 1 times pi over 3 is just pi over 3, all over 1 plus x, which is pi over 3,

06:04:00.600 --> 06:04:07.600
times the sine of x, y, which is pi over 3. If we remember our unit circle, pi over

06:04:15.280 --> 06:04:22.280
3, the y coordinate there is the square root of 3 over 2, so we have negative root 3 over

06:04:22.720 --> 06:04:29.720
2, over 1 plus pi over 3 times, again the sine of pi over 3 is root 3 over 2. I don't

06:04:37.440 --> 06:04:44.040
like having those fractions and fractions, so let's clear out those fractions and fractions.

06:04:44.040 --> 06:04:51.040
We've got a common denominator of 6. I'm going to multiply by 6 and distribute that 6 through.

06:04:51.320 --> 06:04:58.320
6 over 2 will reduce to 3, so we have negative 3 root 3 over 6 plus 3 times 2 is 6, which

06:05:00.760 --> 06:05:07.760
will reduce to the 6, so that's pi root 3. It looks weird and ugly, but sure enough

06:05:08.960 --> 06:05:15.960
it is our derivative. We have y equals our slope, which is negative 3 root 3, and we

06:05:21.480 --> 06:05:28.480
have negative 3 root 3 over 6 plus pi root 3 times x minus the x coordinate, which is

06:05:30.160 --> 06:05:37.160
pi over 3, plus our y coordinate, which is 1, and this is the equation of the line that

06:05:38.520 --> 06:05:45.520
is tangent to cosine xy equals y. So that's implicit differentiation. The idea behind

06:05:45.960 --> 06:05:52.960
implicit differentiation is that we just take the derivative of both sides of the equation.

06:05:55.280 --> 06:06:02.280
Using the chain rule, knowing that the derivative of y is dy dx, because y is a function of

06:06:02.640 --> 06:06:08.160
x, it's not just a variable, it is a function of x, so we use our chain rule and multiply

06:06:08.160 --> 06:06:15.160
by the derivative of y. Then we just have to solve the resulting equation for dy dx.

06:06:18.680 --> 06:06:22.760
Looking forward to seeing you in class when we can work on this a little bit more. Give

06:06:22.760 --> 06:06:28.880
yourself some time to practice before then, and we'll see you in class.

06:06:28.880 --> 06:06:33.480
There is one more set of functions that we haven't taken a look at how to find the derivative

06:06:33.480 --> 06:06:40.480
of. So we're going to attempt to answer that question today, is how do we find the derivative

06:06:48.920 --> 06:06:55.920
of exponential and logarithmic functions?

06:07:04.480 --> 06:07:10.160
And we'll break that up into two halves once. We'll talk about the exponentials and then

06:07:10.160 --> 06:07:17.160
we'll come back and talk about the logarithmic functions. So first, exponential functions.

06:07:24.120 --> 06:07:31.120
Some important formulas that will help us take derivative. The nicest derivative formula

06:07:31.280 --> 06:07:37.400
I have all, and it's also the most interesting, is that the derivative of e to the x, the slope

06:07:37.400 --> 06:07:44.400
of the tangent line to e to the x at e to the x, is actually exactly e to the x. Which

06:07:50.040 --> 06:07:56.880
is kind of weird when you think about it. But if our base is not e to the x, it turns

06:07:56.880 --> 06:08:03.880
out the derivative of any base to the x is that base to the x times the natural log of

06:08:06.080 --> 06:08:13.080
the base. Which just so happens that the natural log of e is just one, so we end up with two

06:08:15.200 --> 06:08:19.680
formulas that could be condensed into one. But since we use e to the x so often, we'll

06:08:19.680 --> 06:08:24.520
give it its own little formula. These two formulas are going to be what guide us here

06:08:24.520 --> 06:08:31.520
as we go into the first part of this video. So let's take a look at some examples of taking

06:08:34.000 --> 06:08:41.000
derivatives with exponentials. Let's say f of x equals e to the cosine of x squared.

06:08:47.480 --> 06:08:52.320
What we really have here is just a really big chain rule problem. It's a three level

06:08:52.360 --> 06:08:58.760
chain rule, but we can do that. F prime of x is equal to the derivative of the outside

06:08:58.760 --> 06:09:05.760
and the derivative of e to the x is e to the stuff, e to the cosine of x squared times

06:09:07.320 --> 06:09:14.320
the derivative of the inside stuff, and so the derivative of cosine is negative sign

06:09:15.280 --> 06:09:22.280
of the stuff, times the derivative of the inside stuff. And the derivative of cosine

06:09:22.320 --> 06:09:31.200
of x squared is just 2x. Cleaning this up a little bit, putting the negative and 2x

06:09:31.200 --> 06:09:39.760
out front, we'll put the sine of x squared next, and then the e to the cosine of x squared

06:09:39.760 --> 06:09:46.600
after that, just so that it looks a little nicer. But that way we found our derivative,

06:09:46.600 --> 06:09:54.960
which contained in e to the x. We could even expand this into any of our rules or patterns

06:09:54.960 --> 06:10:02.080
that we've seen thus far, so what if we did a quotient rule? f of x is equal to e to the

06:10:02.080 --> 06:10:13.840
3x minus 7 all over x squared plus 5x. Well, we should be very comfortable with the quotient

06:10:13.840 --> 06:10:20.280
rule by now, so we take the derivative of the top, which is e to the 3x minus 7, because

06:10:20.280 --> 06:10:26.240
the derivative of e to something is e to that something. But we have to multiply by the

06:10:26.240 --> 06:10:34.560
derivative of the inside, which is just 3, and then we have to multiply by the denominator

06:10:34.760 --> 06:10:45.520
x squared plus 5x. Then we subtract the derivative of the denominator, which is 2x plus 5, times

06:10:45.520 --> 06:10:52.720
the numerator, which is e to the 3x minus 7, and that's all over the denominator squared

06:10:52.720 --> 06:11:02.720
x squared plus 5x squared. Not a lot to clean up in there, so after using our quotient rule

06:11:02.800 --> 06:11:13.800
and the exponent rule, we'll call that our derivative. Let's do one more, one that doesn't

06:11:13.800 --> 06:11:25.800
use a base of e to the x, but uses some different base. Let's try f of x equals 4 to the x

06:11:25.800 --> 06:11:33.920
times 5 to the x minus x. We could distribute the 4 to the x through, and then we don't

06:11:33.920 --> 06:11:39.920
have to use the product rule. Well, we still would, but let's just keep it the way it is.

06:11:39.920 --> 06:11:46.720
f prime of x is equal to, and we'll use the product rule here. The derivative of the first

06:11:46.720 --> 06:11:53.000
part, the derivative of 4 to the x is 4 to the x, but if the base is not e, we need to

06:11:53.020 --> 06:12:04.020
multiply by the natural log of the base, then times the second part, 5 to the x minus 1,

06:12:04.020 --> 06:12:13.520
plus the derivative of the second part, well the derivative of an exponential is the exponential

06:12:13.520 --> 06:12:23.080
times the natural log of the base minus the derivative of x is 1, times the first part,

06:12:23.080 --> 06:12:30.200
which is just 4 to the x, and there's not really much that cleans up in this example

06:12:30.200 --> 06:12:38.200
either, and so we end up with our solution. Basically, all we're doing is we're expanding

06:12:39.120 --> 06:12:46.120
our repertoire of derivatives to include these two exponential formulas. The derivative of

06:12:46.120 --> 06:12:53.120
anything is, I'm sorry, the derivative of the exponential is the exponential times the

06:12:53.120 --> 06:12:58.120
natural log of the base. If it's e to the x, it's really nice because the derivative of

06:12:58.120 --> 06:13:10.400
e to the x is just e to the x. We can use the fact that the exponential derivative is

06:13:10.400 --> 06:13:23.400
so simple to derive and create the derivative of the logarithmic, if I can spell it right.

06:13:23.400 --> 06:13:38.000
Logarithmic functions, and the way we get the derivative of the logarithmic functions is

06:13:38.000 --> 06:13:57.480
we use implicit differentiation, because we know that if y equals the natural log of x,

06:13:57.480 --> 06:14:08.960
we can rewrite this as e to the y equals x, because the base is e, the exponent is y,

06:14:08.960 --> 06:14:14.360
and then if we take the derivative of both sides of this guy using implicit differentiation,

06:14:14.360 --> 06:14:26.240
the derivative of e to the y is e to the y dy dx equals, the derivative of x is 1, dividing

06:14:26.240 --> 06:14:38.960
both sides by e to the y, we get the derivative dy dx is equal to 1 over e to the y. But the

06:14:38.960 --> 06:14:48.360
good news is, is that we know what y equals. y is equal to the natural log of x. So we

06:14:48.360 --> 06:14:54.000
have 1 over e to the natural log of x, but e and the natural log with the same base is

06:14:54.000 --> 06:15:00.600
our inverses, so that leaves us with just the x, and so we find out that dy dx is equal

06:15:00.600 --> 06:15:20.880
to 1 over x. Kinda need how the formula comes out, so we've got our formulas for the logarithms.

06:15:20.880 --> 06:15:30.420
The derivative of the natural log of x, we just found out is simply 1 over x. If the

06:15:30.420 --> 06:15:36.040
base isn't a base either, we can do the derivative of any log base b of x, doing just a simple

06:15:36.040 --> 06:15:46.360
change of base formula, we end up with 1 over x natural log of b, and these two formulas

06:15:46.360 --> 06:15:54.500
allow us to take the derivatives with logarithms. Two more formulas to add to our derivative

06:15:54.500 --> 06:16:04.680
repertoire. And so we should be able to solve a whole bunch of examples using all the other

06:16:04.680 --> 06:16:16.520
derivative rules we've seen, but now throwing in some logarithms. If f of x equals the natural

06:16:16.520 --> 06:16:27.520
log of the tangent of x squared minus 5x, what we really have is derivatives inside of

06:16:27.520 --> 06:16:40.200
derivatives, so that f prime of x equals, using the chain rule, natural log, the derivative

06:16:40.200 --> 06:16:49.880
of that is 1 over the stuff, 1 over the tangent of x squared minus 5x, times the derivative

06:16:49.880 --> 06:16:58.920
of the inside. Well, the derivative of tangent is secant squared of the stuff, x squared

06:16:58.920 --> 06:17:08.600
minus 5x, times the derivative of the inside, which is the x squared minus 5x, the derivative

06:17:08.600 --> 06:17:19.600
there is 2x minus 5, and all there is to do is clean that up nicely, all that stuff multiplied

06:17:19.600 --> 06:17:25.320
ends up in the numerator, and so we get this nice derivative secant squared of x squared

06:17:25.320 --> 06:17:50.360
minus 5x, times the 2x minus 5, all over the tangent of x squared minus 5x. Let's try

06:17:50.360 --> 06:18:00.280
one with the log that's got a different base. Let's say f of x is equal to the log base

06:18:00.280 --> 06:18:19.920
7 of 2x minus 5, times the cosine of 5x. Here we have the product rule again, so we'll

06:18:19.920 --> 06:18:33.120
take the derivative of the first, the derivative of log base 7 is 1 over the stuff, the 2x

06:18:33.120 --> 06:18:39.280
minus 5, and because it's not a base e, we have to multiply by the natural log of the

06:18:39.280 --> 06:18:49.560
base or the natural log of 7, times the second part. Actually, before we get to the second

06:18:49.560 --> 06:18:57.240
part, we still need to multiply by the derivative of the inside, which is just 2, times the

06:18:57.240 --> 06:19:07.820
second part, which is cosine of 5x, plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative

06:19:07.820 --> 06:19:17.000
of cosine is negative sine, so let's change that to negative sine of 5x, times the derivative

06:19:17.000 --> 06:19:25.140
of the inside, which is 5, and we still have to, using the product rule, multiply by the

06:19:25.140 --> 06:19:36.540
first part, which is log base 7 of 2x minus 5. I just want to clean it up a little bit,

06:19:36.540 --> 06:19:41.700
not much to clean up, but we'll definitely make it easier on the eyes. We'll combine

06:19:41.700 --> 06:19:53.900
the fraction together, so we have 2 cosine of 5x over 2x minus 5, natural log of 7, minus,

06:19:53.900 --> 06:20:13.980
we'll put the 5 out front, sine of 5x, log base 7 of 2x minus 5, and we have our derivative.

06:20:13.980 --> 06:20:19.600
One nice thing that comes out of working with logarithms and derivatives is that logs have

06:20:19.600 --> 06:20:28.180
some nice properties that help us simplify out to something that is very simple to take

06:20:28.180 --> 06:20:37.300
the derivative of. For example, if we were given f of x equals the natural log of x to

06:20:37.300 --> 06:20:48.860
the fourth, cosine of x, divided by the square root of x plus 3, that looks very ugly to

06:20:48.880 --> 06:20:57.280
take the derivative of. However, we can break this up into three separate logarithms, one

06:20:57.280 --> 06:21:04.680
for each factor. The logarithm from the denominator is going to be negative, and then we can also

06:21:04.680 --> 06:21:10.440
pull exponents out in front of logarithms. So what we really have here, rewriting the

06:21:10.440 --> 06:21:20.340
function is the natural log of x to the fourth, but the four moves out front, plus the natural

06:21:20.340 --> 06:21:30.660
log of the cosine of x minus the natural log of the x plus 3, and then the one half power

06:21:30.680 --> 06:21:40.720
can move out front. Now we've got something that's much easier to work with, much easier

06:21:40.720 --> 06:21:47.400
to take the derivative of. f prime of x is equal to, we've got a constant of 4 times

06:21:47.400 --> 06:21:56.000
the derivative of the natural log of x, which is just 1 over x, plus the natural log means

06:21:56.000 --> 06:22:02.620
the derivative is 1 over that, so 1 over cosine of x, times the derivative of the inside,

06:22:02.620 --> 06:22:13.220
which is negative sine of x, we'll just stick that in the numerator, minus one half, that's

06:22:13.220 --> 06:22:19.580
a constant, so that's going to be out front, and the derivative of the natural log is 1

06:22:19.580 --> 06:22:29.160
over the stuff, x plus 3, times the derivative of the inside, which is just 1, and we can

06:22:29.160 --> 06:22:36.840
clean this up a little bit even, so that it's equal to 4 over x, we'll just say minus instead

06:22:36.840 --> 06:22:43.800
of plus or negative, and sine over cosine we should recognize, sine over cosine is the

06:22:43.800 --> 06:22:53.140
tangent, minus 1 over, and we could distribute if we want, 2x plus 6, don't have to distribute,

06:22:53.140 --> 06:23:03.260
but why not, and we get this nice derivative. So that's one nice thing that comes out of

06:23:03.260 --> 06:23:10.260
derivatives with logarithms, is quite often logarithms help us break the problem down,

06:23:10.260 --> 06:23:18.480
where it started complex, what we end up with is quite simple to take the logarithm of.

06:23:18.480 --> 06:23:36.760
Another nice trick that comes out of this, is what we call logarithmic differentiation,

06:23:36.760 --> 06:23:51.700
which we use when the variable, we'll say x, but the variable is in both the exponent

06:23:51.700 --> 06:24:07.320
and base, and the most classic example of that is if y equals x to the x power. Here

06:24:07.320 --> 06:24:11.840
we can't really take the derivative because we could use the exponent rule, but that doesn't

06:24:11.840 --> 06:24:19.160
work because we don't know what x is, we don't know how to do the base, we're kind of stuck

06:24:19.160 --> 06:24:25.020
until we get this nice trick called logarithmic differentiation, where we take the natural

06:24:25.020 --> 06:24:34.280
log of both sides, and when we do we get the natural log of y equals the natural log of

06:24:34.280 --> 06:24:47.940
x to the x power, which allows us to use the log property. The log property says the natural

06:24:48.180 --> 06:24:54.960
log of x to the n is equal to n times the natural log of x, we can move that exponent

06:24:54.960 --> 06:25:07.280
out front, so now we have the natural log of y equals x times the natural log of x. Now

06:25:07.280 --> 06:25:12.000
we can take the derivative, but because this has the natural log of y on both sides we

06:25:12.060 --> 06:25:32.060
have to do implicit differentiation. The derivative of the natural log of y is 1 over y dy dx.

06:25:32.060 --> 06:25:36.180
The derivative of x natural log of x, that's a product rule, we'll always end up with a

06:25:36.200 --> 06:25:47.080
product rule here, the derivative of x is 1 times the natural log of x, plus the derivative

06:25:47.080 --> 06:25:55.560
of natural log of x is 1 over x times the first, which is just x, but x over x is just

06:25:55.560 --> 06:26:07.940
equal to 1, which is really nice. Then what we need to do is solve for the dy dx, we know

06:26:07.940 --> 06:26:16.700
implicit differentiation, and it always turns out to do that we multiply by y. With implicit

06:26:16.700 --> 06:26:21.540
differentiation this step is always the same, because you'll always have 1 over y, I'm sorry

06:26:21.540 --> 06:26:26.520
not with implicit differentiation, with logarithmic differentiation this step is always the same,

06:26:26.520 --> 06:26:32.520
because you'll always have 1 over y on the right, so we'll multiply both sides by y,

06:26:32.520 --> 06:26:43.020
giving us dy dx is equal to the natural log of x plus 1 times y. So all that's left to

06:26:43.020 --> 06:26:56.960
do then is to substitute y from the original function, y is equal to x to the x, so dy

06:26:56.960 --> 06:27:03.720
dx is equal to, and I'll just put the y in front, x to the x times the natural log of

06:27:03.720 --> 06:27:17.980
x plus 1, and now we've got our derivative. We can use this process though to solve things

06:27:17.980 --> 06:27:23.260
that are much more complex than x to the x, we'll use this process of taking the log of

06:27:23.260 --> 06:27:28.860
both sides and then the derivative implicitly to solve things more complex that might look

06:27:28.860 --> 06:27:46.000
something like this, y equals 3x squared minus 5x all to the sine of x power. We have x both

06:27:46.000 --> 06:27:53.400
in the base and in the exponent, when it occurs in both places we take the natural log of

06:27:53.400 --> 06:28:04.060
both sides, the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x to the sine of x, whoops lost my

06:28:04.060 --> 06:28:12.460
end, not to the sixth to the sine of x, let's clean that up. Now we have our log property

06:28:12.460 --> 06:28:17.960
that says that exponent can come out front, so we know the natural log of y is equal to

06:28:17.960 --> 06:28:30.320
the sine of x times the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x, then we can take the derivative

06:28:30.320 --> 06:28:39.560
implicitly. On the left the derivative of the natural log of y is 1 over y times our

06:28:39.560 --> 06:28:49.800
dy dx is equal to, we have a product rule here, the derivative of sine is cosine x times

06:28:49.800 --> 06:28:58.360
the natural log of 3x squared minus 5x plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative

06:28:58.360 --> 06:29:07.240
of natural log is 1 over the stuff, 3x squared minus 5x times the derivative of the inside,

06:29:07.240 --> 06:29:23.000
and I'll go in the numerator, 6x minus 5 times the first part, the sine of x. Now we can

06:29:23.000 --> 06:29:34.920
solve for the dy dx by multiplying both sides by y, and that tells us that dy dx is equal

06:29:34.920 --> 06:29:47.200
to the cosine x natural log of 3x squared minus 5x plus 6x minus 5 times the sine of

06:29:47.200 --> 06:30:02.600
x all over 3x squared minus 5x times y, but we know what y equals, y is equal to the original

06:30:03.320 --> 06:30:15.120
problem. So dy dx is equal to the cosine of x times the natural log of 3x squared minus

06:30:15.120 --> 06:30:27.960
5x plus 6x minus 5 sine of x divided by 3x squared minus 5x times our original problem

06:30:27.960 --> 06:30:42.440
which was 3x squared minus 5x all to the sine of x power. And logarithms take that which

06:30:42.440 --> 06:30:50.440
once was impossible, now very possible and straight forward. So we've kind of done three

06:30:50.440 --> 06:30:55.040
things today, we talked about the derivatives of the exponentials, specifically e to the

06:30:55.040 --> 06:31:01.800
x is e to the x, we talked about the derivatives of the logarithms, the derivative of the natural

06:31:01.800 --> 06:31:10.600
log is 1 over x or 1 over the stuff, and then we talked about doing logarithmic differentiation

06:31:10.600 --> 06:31:16.720
to take problems that would otherwise be impossible to take derivatives of, change their form

06:31:16.720 --> 06:31:24.080
so that we can use logarithmic differentiation to find our derivative. Couple things to practice

06:31:24.120 --> 06:31:32.960
with, take a look at those and we will see you in class to work on them further.

06:31:32.960 --> 06:31:39.000
This video is going to take a look at a preview of working in two dimensions and three dimensions

06:31:39.000 --> 06:31:43.760
and taking derivatives. Thus far we've only taken derivatives in the x direction where

06:31:43.760 --> 06:31:49.040
we've got a coordinate plane in two dimensions, but we can extend that to a three dimensional

06:31:49.040 --> 06:31:55.240
coordinate plane and still work with derivatives. The trick is we have to decide what direction

06:31:55.240 --> 06:32:15.040
we're going in. So the question is going to be how do we calculate derivatives in 3D?

06:32:15.040 --> 06:32:21.200
Now a 3D function, generally a 2D function is f of x, we've done a lot of work with that

06:32:21.200 --> 06:32:28.120
because we just take the derivative with response to f of x with respect to x, but a three dimensional

06:32:28.120 --> 06:32:34.360
function will have variables x and y in them to result in a z variable that's a solution.

06:32:34.360 --> 06:32:39.320
So these are still a function, we've just got multiple variables inside the function,

06:32:39.320 --> 06:32:51.440
and the way we take those derivatives is we take what is called a partial derivative,

06:32:51.440 --> 06:33:12.520
or a derivative or rate of change in a specific direction. In other words, are we going left

06:33:12.520 --> 06:33:17.840
and right? Are we going forwards and backwards? How far are we changing in each of these two

06:33:18.240 --> 06:33:24.720
directions? And so to specify that we're just taking a derivative partially in one direction,

06:33:24.720 --> 06:33:36.880
we've got a special notation to indicate this. You will see what we call the partial derivative

06:33:36.880 --> 06:33:51.880
of f with respect to x. I'll even write that, that's the partial derivative in the x direction,

06:33:51.880 --> 06:34:03.160
and you might think about that as the left right direction loosely. And it's kind of

06:34:03.160 --> 06:34:09.960
this funky df dx that we saw before, but now because it's got this curved looking d, that

06:34:09.960 --> 06:34:15.960
notation should tell us we're talking about a partial derivative in the x direction. And

06:34:15.960 --> 06:34:27.520
similarly, you'll see a partial derivative with respect to y, that's the partial derivative

06:34:27.520 --> 06:34:33.720
in the y direction, or how fast we're changing in the y direction, which you might think

06:34:33.720 --> 06:34:41.800
of loosely as the up-down direction. And by up-down, I mean if I'm looking down at a

06:34:41.800 --> 06:34:48.520
piece of paper, away from me and towards me, up-down, or left-right would be the other

06:34:48.520 --> 06:34:53.640
two directions. So how are we changing left and right? How are we changing horizontally?

06:34:53.640 --> 06:35:02.760
As we've got a partial change of the function. And the way we actually calculate a partial

06:35:02.760 --> 06:35:29.560
derivative is we treat all other variables as constants.

06:35:29.560 --> 06:35:45.560
So for example, let's say we've got f of x, y is equal to 3x squared y to the fourth.

06:35:45.560 --> 06:35:53.880
And if I wanted to calculate the partial of f with respect to x in the x direction, we're

06:35:53.880 --> 06:35:59.040
going to take the derivative with respect to x, and we're going to pretend the y is

06:35:59.040 --> 06:36:07.960
a constant. So the derivative of 3x squared is 6x, and the y to the fourth is a constant.

06:36:07.960 --> 06:36:16.080
So it's going to kind of hang out like constants do when they're multiplied by our x. I could

06:36:16.080 --> 06:36:23.000
also take the derivative of this same function with respect to the y. In that case, we take

06:36:23.000 --> 06:36:28.960
the derivative of the y, which is y cubed, and then we bring the 4 out front, 4 times

06:36:28.960 --> 06:36:39.560
3 is 12, and we keep the x squared as if it was a constant, as if it was part of the 3.

06:36:39.560 --> 06:37:00.280
Really important here to note, though, that the notation and process is different than

06:37:00.280 --> 06:37:16.520
implicit differentiation. Implicit differentiation used that whole dy dx. With dy dx, y was

06:37:16.520 --> 06:37:23.360
a function of x in two dimensions. y was f of x. Now we've got a three-dimensional function

06:37:23.360 --> 06:37:29.360
that has x's and y's in the function, but these are functions. These pass the vertical

06:37:29.600 --> 06:37:37.100
line test, or in three dimensions, the vertical plane test. With implicit differentiation,

06:37:37.100 --> 06:37:41.400
we took the derivative of y as if it was a function of x, and then multiplied by its

06:37:41.400 --> 06:37:46.160
derivative dy dx. That is different than partial derivatives, where we're just going

06:37:46.160 --> 06:37:54.360
in the x direction in three dimensions, and the y is treated like a constant. Or we're

06:37:54.360 --> 06:37:59.960
going in the y direction, and the x is treated as a constant. Be careful not to mix these

06:37:59.960 --> 06:38:09.260
two processes, because they are very different. Let's try a few examples, though, where we

06:38:09.260 --> 06:38:13.920
have to take a bunch of partials. What's nice about these partial derivatives is it's a great

06:38:13.920 --> 06:38:20.760
place for us to synthesize all the derivative rules that we have seen up to this point and

06:38:20.760 --> 06:38:33.280
see how we do. Let's first take a function in x and y. Let's call it 5x squared minus

06:38:33.280 --> 06:38:48.920
7xy minus 9y to the fifth plus 2x minus 7y plus 3. First, we'll find the partial of f

06:38:48.920 --> 06:38:57.440
with respect to x. We're going to pretend like all the y's are constants as we take

06:38:57.440 --> 06:39:06.140
the derivative with respect to x. Our first term, we know that's 10x, minus the derivative

06:39:06.140 --> 06:39:16.560
of x is 1, so we're just left with the constants 7 and y. The 9y to the fifth, those are all

06:39:16.600 --> 06:39:24.100
constants, and the derivative of just a constant is 0, so that term's gone. 2x, the derivative

06:39:24.100 --> 06:39:33.000
of that, is just 2. Again, the 7y, all constant, the 3, constant. Therefore, those derivatives

06:39:33.000 --> 06:39:43.560
are also 0. Our partial derivative of f with respect to x is 10x minus 7y plus 2. We can

06:39:43.560 --> 06:39:50.240
also take the partial derivative of f with respect to the y. With respect to the y, the

06:39:50.240 --> 06:39:58.320
5x squared is now a constant, so that's 0. Negative 7xy, the derivative of the y is

06:39:58.320 --> 06:40:04.280
1, so we're just left with the constant 7x. The derivative of negative 9y to the fifth

06:40:04.280 --> 06:40:12.640
is negative 45y to the fourth, bringing that 5 out front and dropping the exponent by 1.

06:40:12.640 --> 06:40:21.440
2x, it's all constant. The derivative of negative 7y is negative 7, and 3 is also a constant,

06:40:21.440 --> 06:40:28.300
so that derivative is 0. Now we've got our partial derivatives with respect to x and

06:40:28.300 --> 06:40:36.700
the partial derivative with respect to y. Let's try another one. We'll increase in complexity

06:40:36.700 --> 06:40:43.780
here, making these more interesting. Function of f with respect to x and y, the function

06:40:43.780 --> 06:40:57.280
of f with x and y as variables is the secant of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y, and

06:40:57.280 --> 06:41:06.760
now the partial of f with respect to x. Here we've got a chain rule set up. We've got a

06:41:06.760 --> 06:41:13.440
secant of stuff. The derivative of secant is secant tangent of the stuff, so the secant

06:41:13.440 --> 06:41:24.160
of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y tangent of the stuff, which is x to the fourth y plus

06:41:24.160 --> 06:41:34.880
7x minus 4y times the derivative of the stuff inside it with respect to x. The x to the

06:41:34.880 --> 06:41:43.480
fourth becomes 4x cubed with the constant of y still there, plus the derivative of 7x

06:41:43.480 --> 06:41:51.920
is just 7. Negative 4y, those are all constants because we treat the y as a constant, so it's

06:41:51.920 --> 06:42:03.400
zero, and now we've got our partial derivative of f with respect to x. Let's try the partial

06:42:03.400 --> 06:42:13.720
derivative of f with respect to y. Very similar chain rule again. The derivative of secant

06:42:13.720 --> 06:42:22.680
is still the secant tangent of the stuff, so we have the secant of x to the fourth y

06:42:22.680 --> 06:42:35.680
plus 7x minus 4y tangent of x to the fourth y plus 7x minus 4y times the derivative of

06:42:35.680 --> 06:42:46.520
the inside stuff with respect to y. So now with the x to the fourth y, the derivative

06:42:46.520 --> 06:42:54.240
of y is just 1, so we're left with the constant x to the fourth. 7x doesn't have any y's

06:42:54.240 --> 06:43:04.720
on it, so that goes to zero, and the derivative of negative 4y is negative 4. Now we've got

06:43:04.720 --> 06:43:18.640
the derivative, the partial derivative with respect to y. Let's make this a little more

06:43:18.640 --> 06:43:29.880
interesting. Let's say f is a function of x and y, which is equal to e to the x, y cosine

06:43:29.880 --> 06:43:48.560
of 2x, sine of 3y, and if we want the partial of f with respect to x. Here we've got a

06:43:48.560 --> 06:43:54.880
product with respect to x. The sine of 3y is a constant, so really the only product

06:43:54.880 --> 06:44:04.320
is e to the x, y times the cosine of 2x, and then we will have that constant out in front.

06:44:04.320 --> 06:44:11.480
So I'm just going to go ahead and write that constant in front. The sine of 3y times the

06:44:11.480 --> 06:44:18.960
derivative of e to the x, y is e to the x, y times the derivative of the inside with

06:44:18.960 --> 06:44:29.600
respect to x is just y times the second part, which is the cosine of 2x, plus the derivative

06:44:29.600 --> 06:44:35.400
of the second part. The derivative of cosine is negative sine. Let's make that negative

06:44:35.400 --> 06:44:43.960
sine of 2x times the derivative of the inside, which is 2, and let's go ahead and put that

06:44:43.960 --> 06:44:55.520
2 in front of the sine just to keep it clean. Times the other part, e to the x, y, and we've

06:44:55.520 --> 06:45:04.720
got our partial derivative with respect to x. Let's also do the partial derivative of

06:45:04.720 --> 06:45:14.320
f with respect to y. Very similarly, but this time, notice the factor of cosine of 2x does

06:45:14.320 --> 06:45:21.360
not have any y's on it. That is a constant that's being multiplied by stuff with y's.

06:45:21.360 --> 06:45:29.360
So that constant we'll put out front, cosine of 2x, times the derivative of the product.

06:45:29.560 --> 06:45:37.840
Our product is multiplying e to the x, y times the sine of 3y. We'll take the derivative

06:45:37.840 --> 06:45:45.040
of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second times the first, all the partial

06:45:45.040 --> 06:45:54.220
with respect to y. The derivative of e to the x, y is e to the x, y times the derivative

06:45:54.220 --> 06:46:01.900
of the inside, the derivative of x, y with respect to y is just x, times the second part,

06:46:01.900 --> 06:46:09.860
which is the sine of 3y, plus the derivative of the second part, the derivative of sine

06:46:09.860 --> 06:46:20.700
is the cosine of 3y, times the derivative of the inside, which is a 3, times the first

06:46:20.700 --> 06:46:37.140
part, e to the x, y. And we have our derivative. Let's try one last example.

06:46:37.140 --> 06:46:50.140
F is a function of x and y. It's equal to the tangent of x to the fourth, y to the third,

06:46:50.140 --> 06:47:01.580
times the natural log of 5 over x, y. Now something to make life easier, you should

06:47:01.580 --> 06:47:06.580
be very good at picking up now. When we see a fraction like 5 over x, y, we can think

06:47:06.580 --> 06:47:18.820
about that as 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1, because that's going to be easier

06:47:18.820 --> 06:47:24.100
to take the derivative of. So as we take the derivative, that's the natural log of 5x to

06:47:24.100 --> 06:47:30.620
the negative 1, y to the negative 1. And first we're going to do the partial derivative of

06:47:30.620 --> 06:47:39.860
f with respect to x. And again, we have a product rule. And each product part is going

06:47:39.860 --> 06:47:45.780
to be a chain rule, so there's going to be a couple pieces to this one. First, the derivative

06:47:45.780 --> 06:47:56.140
of the first times the second. The derivative of tangent is secant squared of the stuff.

06:47:56.140 --> 06:48:03.740
And then we multiply by the derivative of the inside with respect to x. So the derivative

06:48:03.740 --> 06:48:11.740
of x to the fourth is 4x cubed. And the y cubed is a constant. Times the natural log

06:48:11.740 --> 06:48:22.940
of 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1. Plus, the derivative of the second. The

06:48:22.940 --> 06:48:31.660
derivative of natural log is 1 over the stuff, 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1.

06:48:31.660 --> 06:48:40.420
Times the derivative of the inside with respect to x, which is going to be negative 5x to

06:48:40.420 --> 06:48:46.780
the negative 2, bringing the negative 1 out front, subtracting 1. And the y to the negative

06:48:46.780 --> 06:49:00.580
1 is a constant. Times the tangent of x to the fourth, y cubed. Times the first part.

06:49:00.580 --> 06:49:07.500
Little bit to clean up, let's move the 4x cubed, y cubed to the front. Also the 5 over

06:49:07.740 --> 06:49:15.860
5 reduces out. The y to the negative 1s reduce out, which is really nice. And so we're just

06:49:15.860 --> 06:49:26.300
left with an x to the, when I move the negative 2 down, it's going to be just a positive 1

06:49:26.300 --> 06:49:36.620
left over. So cleaning that up, we get 4x cubed, y cubed secant squared of x to the

06:49:36.620 --> 06:49:48.220
fourth, y cubed natural log of, let's go ahead and make this a fraction, 5 over x, y. Plus,

06:49:48.220 --> 06:49:55.020
we've got the tangent of x cubed, or I'm sorry, x to the fourth, y cubed. And all that's

06:49:55.020 --> 06:50:01.900
left from that ugly fraction we crossed everything out is just an x in the denominator. And now

06:50:01.900 --> 06:50:14.940
we've got our partial derivative with respect to x. Let's do the partial derivative with

06:50:14.940 --> 06:50:21.180
respect to y. It's going to be very similar because x and y appear in very similar locations.

06:50:21.180 --> 06:50:28.700
But just to walk through it together, product rule again. So first, the derivative of tangent

06:50:28.780 --> 06:50:38.540
is secant squared of the stuff, x to the fourth, y cubed times the derivative of the inside,

06:50:38.540 --> 06:50:46.860
this time with respect to y. In the y direction is 3y squared. And the x to the fourth is a constant

06:50:49.900 --> 06:50:55.180
times the second part, which is the natural log of, I'll just leave it as 5 over x, y.

06:50:55.180 --> 06:51:06.780
Plus, the derivative of the second part, which is natural log is 1 over the stuff,

06:51:06.780 --> 06:51:16.060
1 over 5x to the negative 1, y to the negative 1 times the derivative of the inside, which is

06:51:16.060 --> 06:51:23.500
going to be y to the negative 2 with a negative 5 and an x to the negative 1 because an x is a constant.

06:51:25.340 --> 06:51:30.380
Times the first part, which is tangent of x to the fourth, y cubed.

06:51:33.660 --> 06:51:38.300
The cleanup is very similar. We'll move the 3x to the fourth y squared to the front.

06:51:40.060 --> 06:51:45.500
The fives are going to divide out, which is nice. Oops, I just saw an error that I missed earlier.

06:51:45.500 --> 06:51:51.020
We had a minus and my minus disappeared. That should have been a minus on number four.

06:51:51.100 --> 06:51:54.300
I apologize for that. Don't lose your signs.

06:51:56.300 --> 06:52:02.940
But the x to the negative ones do divide out. And when we bring the y down, we'll just be left

06:52:02.940 --> 06:52:12.860
with a single y in the denominator. So for our cleaned up version, we have 3x to the fourth y

06:52:12.860 --> 06:52:24.060
squared secant squared of x to the fourth y cubed natural log of 5 over xy minus because of the

06:52:24.060 --> 06:52:31.020
minus sign. Not forgetting it this time. We'll put the tangent of x cubed x to the fourth y cubed

06:52:31.980 --> 06:52:39.340
in the numerator. And in the denominator, all that's left is a single y. And we have our partial

06:52:39.340 --> 06:52:49.180
derivative with respect to y. The homework assignment with partial derivatives is really short,

06:52:49.980 --> 06:52:54.620
but they are going to force you to review all of these derivatives properties we've worked with

06:52:54.620 --> 06:52:59.980
here in chapter three, which is what makes it such a great assignment. So take a look at it,

06:52:59.980 --> 06:53:05.420
give it a good practice, and then we will see you in class to discuss these partial derivatives

06:53:05.420 --> 06:53:15.500
in a little more detail. Chapter four is going to take a look at how we can use the derivative

06:53:15.500 --> 06:53:22.220
in various contexts and applications. The first one is what are called related rates. And so our

06:53:22.220 --> 06:53:27.900
question we're going to answer is how are rates of change?

06:53:35.180 --> 06:53:41.820
That's a derivative, a rate of change. How are they related to each other?

06:53:42.140 --> 06:54:00.540
And this is what brings up this idea of related rates. And basically a related rate means two

06:54:00.540 --> 06:54:05.660
things are changing, but they're changing in relationship to one another. One increases at

06:54:05.660 --> 06:54:11.260
a certain rate and it makes the other one increase or decrease at a certain rate. The best example

06:54:11.260 --> 06:54:17.180
of this is if you think about filling up a balloon. Let's say if we have a spherical balloon

06:54:17.660 --> 06:54:24.860
that is filled

06:54:27.740 --> 06:54:41.020
with air at a rate of three cubic inches per second.

06:54:41.100 --> 06:54:46.860
We want to know how fast

06:54:49.820 --> 06:54:51.420
is the radius changing

06:55:02.220 --> 06:55:03.260
when the radius

06:55:06.700 --> 06:55:10.860
is four inches?

06:55:11.020 --> 06:55:17.500
As we solve these related rate problems, the radius of the balloon is related to the amount

06:55:17.500 --> 06:55:24.220
of air in it. As we solve these problems, we're going to go through kind of a four-step process.

06:55:24.220 --> 06:55:28.300
The first step is going to be to draw a picture

06:55:32.140 --> 06:55:40.860
with the related formulas.

06:55:41.500 --> 06:55:50.140
So we're talking here about a sphere. So we'll draw our little spherical balloon here

06:55:52.140 --> 06:55:57.820
and the radius of r. And we're talking specifically about the volume or how much

06:55:57.820 --> 06:56:03.260
stuff is in this circle. And we can look up or we might know the formula for the volume of a sphere

06:56:03.260 --> 06:56:07.500
is four-thirds pi times the radius cubed.

06:56:10.620 --> 06:56:16.540
Once we know that relationship, we're ready for the second step which is to take the derivative

06:56:23.740 --> 06:56:25.100
with respect

06:56:28.940 --> 06:56:33.100
to time.

06:56:33.980 --> 06:56:42.140
So if I were to take the derivative of this guy, we're going to have to use implicit

06:56:42.140 --> 06:56:49.420
differentiation because time t is not a variable here. So v, the derivative of v is just one dv dt

06:56:51.900 --> 06:56:56.300
is equal to when we four-thirds and pi are constants.

06:56:57.260 --> 06:57:04.380
And we know we can use our exponent rule on the three, bringing the three out front and reducing

06:57:04.380 --> 06:57:14.060
it by one, so r squared, and then times the derivative of r which is dr dt. This one's kind

06:57:14.060 --> 06:57:22.540
of nice because the threes are going to divide out. So we really say dv dt is equal to four pi r

06:57:22.540 --> 06:57:39.420
squared dr dt. And now that we have our derivative with respect to time, let's plug in what we know

06:57:39.420 --> 06:57:43.740
and I can't quite fit it all on the screen, so hopefully you have it on your notes. We're going

06:57:43.820 --> 06:58:00.940
to plug in what we know. And what we know is that the volume is increasing at a rate of three cubic

06:58:00.940 --> 06:58:08.940
inches per second. That is the change in volume with respect to time. We also know that the radius

06:58:09.020 --> 06:58:15.580
is currently four inches. It's not changing with respect to time, it's at this moment exactly

06:58:15.580 --> 06:58:24.460
four inches. So when we come down to plug in dv dt, the volume is changing at a rate of three

06:58:24.460 --> 06:58:35.020
cubic inches equals four pi r, the radius we said was four inches squared dr dt. And then all we

06:58:35.020 --> 06:58:49.180
have to do is solve for the remaining rate or dr dt, the change in the rate with respect to time.

06:58:50.140 --> 06:59:00.940
So simplifying, four squared is 16 times four is 64 pi dr dt. And then we can get the dr dt

06:59:01.020 --> 06:59:07.340
or the change in the radius with respect to time. How fast is that radius changing by dividing three

06:59:07.340 --> 06:59:17.260
by the 64 pi? And then we have three over 64 pi inches per second is the rate that radius is

06:59:17.260 --> 06:59:24.380
changing when it's exactly four inches long and the volume is increasing at three cubic inches per

06:59:24.380 --> 06:59:37.180
second. Let's try another related rate problem. Let's say we have a seven foot ladder

06:59:43.660 --> 06:59:45.340
that is sliding down the wall.

06:59:55.340 --> 06:59:57.180
And we know that the top

07:00:01.340 --> 07:00:03.020
is sliding down

07:00:06.460 --> 07:00:18.140
at a rate of 1.5 feet per second. We want to know how fast

07:00:18.460 --> 07:00:23.020
is the bottom moving

07:00:29.100 --> 07:00:31.020
along the ground.

07:00:38.220 --> 07:00:39.020
When the bottom

07:00:39.740 --> 07:00:47.500
is six feet from the wall.

07:00:56.220 --> 07:00:59.420
Let's draw a picture to get a better idea of this. We've got a building,

07:01:00.860 --> 07:01:08.540
the ground, and there is this ladder that's leaning against them. The problem is that ladder is

07:01:08.620 --> 07:01:15.100
sliding down the wall at a rate of 1.5 feet per second.

07:01:18.780 --> 07:01:21.580
We know the ladder itself is seven feet long.

07:01:24.220 --> 07:01:28.780
And the moment we're interested in is the fact that we are six feet from the wall.

07:01:29.580 --> 07:01:39.740
And if we call this other side A, we don't know what A is, but we're going to be able to find

07:01:39.740 --> 07:01:44.940
that pretty quick. The big thing though that we know, we know that the formula for any right

07:01:44.940 --> 07:01:51.740
triangle is that A squared plus B squared equals C squared.

07:01:52.540 --> 07:02:04.220
And we can take the derivative of this with respect to time. We have 2A times the change in A with

07:02:04.620 --> 07:02:16.860
or DADT plus 2B dB dt equals 2C dC dt.

07:02:21.420 --> 07:02:25.100
Then let's go ahead and plug in what we know and see what we come up with.

07:02:26.860 --> 07:02:32.060
We can actually figure out how long A is using the same Pythagorean theorem.

07:02:32.700 --> 07:02:39.500
Seven squared is equal to six squared plus A squared, or A squared plus six squared equals seven

07:02:39.500 --> 07:02:51.500
squared. A squared is 36. A squared plus 36 equals 49. So A squared is equal to 13. A is the square

07:02:51.500 --> 07:03:02.620
root of 13. So at this moment up the wall, we're the square root of 13 high. So plugging that into

07:03:02.620 --> 07:03:11.020
the formula, we have 2 times A, which is the square root of 13, times the change in A with respect

07:03:11.020 --> 07:03:17.900
to time. We know that A is going down, so we're going to say it's negative to represent the downward

07:03:17.900 --> 07:03:23.980
motion, and it's moving down at a rate the change with respect to time is negative 1.5.

07:03:26.220 --> 07:03:34.860
Plus 2B, B is the bottom of six times the change in B with respect to time, and we don't know how

07:03:34.860 --> 07:03:39.420
fast this ladder is moving out. That's what we're looking for, the dB dt.

07:03:40.300 --> 07:03:51.100
Equals 2C. C is seven feet, but how fast is C the ladder's length changing?

07:03:52.460 --> 07:03:57.740
Well, if we think about a ladder sliding down a wall, that ladder's not changing length at all. It's

07:03:57.740 --> 07:04:02.700
always going to be seven feet long, whether it's completely against the wall, completely against

07:04:02.700 --> 07:04:08.060
the ground, or anywhere in between. There's no change in the ladder's length, so we'll use zero

07:04:08.060 --> 07:04:16.140
for that length. When we clean this up, then, we end up with negative 3 square root of 13,

07:04:17.180 --> 07:04:29.900
plus 12 dB dt equals zero. And this is going to solve quite nicely for us. Add the 3 root

07:04:29.900 --> 07:04:39.900
13 to both sides. We get 12 dB dt equals 3 square roots of 13. Divide both sides by 12,

07:04:40.540 --> 07:04:48.700
and the change in B of the base with respect to time is equal to 3 root 13 over 12,

07:04:49.580 --> 07:04:56.620
and what's nice is the 3 over 12 reduce. So for our final rate, this ladder is moving square root

07:04:56.620 --> 07:05:04.300
of 13 over 4 feet per second, when the ladder is six feet from the wall.

07:05:09.740 --> 07:05:10.940
Let's try another example.

07:05:10.940 --> 07:05:18.380
Let's say a camera

07:05:23.420 --> 07:05:24.860
is 2,000 feet

07:05:28.380 --> 07:05:29.100
from a rocket

07:05:34.220 --> 07:05:35.500
that fires vertically.

07:05:41.500 --> 07:05:46.380
And when this rocket

07:05:51.900 --> 07:05:54.060
is 500 feet in the air,

07:06:00.060 --> 07:06:01.260
its velocity,

07:06:01.580 --> 07:06:12.940
I mean speed, but with direction, is 400 feet per second.

07:06:18.300 --> 07:06:27.580
The cameraman needs to know what is the needed rate of change

07:06:31.900 --> 07:06:37.100
of the angle of the camera.

07:06:45.100 --> 07:06:49.020
Let's draw a picture to kind of get an idea of what's going on. We've got a little camera here,

07:06:49.020 --> 07:06:52.380
that's my camera, which is 2,000 feet away

07:06:54.540 --> 07:06:58.940
from the launch point for a rocket. That's my little rocket. It's going to go up in the air,

07:06:59.660 --> 07:07:03.020
and the camera is going to change angle so that it can watch that

07:07:05.180 --> 07:07:07.500
rocket no matter how high it gets.

07:07:11.340 --> 07:07:17.340
We need to come up with an equation that relates these variables. Well, since we're

07:07:17.340 --> 07:07:22.540
dealing with an angle and the side's opposite and adjacent, we should know that the tangent

07:07:22.540 --> 07:07:30.220
of that angle is equal to the height over the 2,000 feet, the opposite over the adjacent.

07:07:32.780 --> 07:07:34.700
Then we can take the derivative of that.

07:07:37.020 --> 07:07:40.300
Actually, let's save ourselves a little bit of work. Before we take the derivative,

07:07:40.300 --> 07:07:43.340
let's multiply both sides by 2,000 so we don't have to

07:07:44.380 --> 07:07:49.180
worry about the fraction. It's just a constant, so it's not going to make much difference.

07:07:49.180 --> 07:07:57.740
Now let's take the derivative of that. The derivative is going to be 2,000 secant squared of theta

07:07:59.980 --> 07:08:04.780
with respect to time, so we have to say dt d theta using that implicit differentiation,

07:08:06.300 --> 07:08:09.340
equals the derivative of the height is dH dt.

07:08:09.500 --> 07:08:18.940
So now we can plug in what we know.

07:08:23.500 --> 07:08:26.220
First, we need to figure out what secant squared of theta is.

07:08:27.420 --> 07:08:35.260
Secant of theta, you remember, is 1 over the cosine of theta, or the reciprocal of cosine.

07:08:35.500 --> 07:08:43.660
If cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, the secant is the hypotenuse over the adjacent, the reciprocal.

07:08:46.780 --> 07:08:52.060
We already know the adjacent side is 2,000. We just need to find the hypotenuse side.

07:08:52.700 --> 07:08:56.380
We're interested in the moment where the height is 500 feet.

07:08:57.180 --> 07:09:08.780
Fortunately, the quadratic formula can tell us that 2,000 squared plus 500 squared is going to be equal to c squared.

07:09:11.260 --> 07:09:17.980
If I were to do that on my calculator, we would get 425 with 4 zeros after it equals c squared,

07:09:17.980 --> 07:09:23.420
and so if I take the square root, c is approximately equal to 2061.55.

07:09:24.380 --> 07:09:27.820
So 2061.55.

07:09:32.220 --> 07:09:40.300
So plugging in what we have, we've got 2,000 times the secant, which is the hypotenuse, 2061.55,

07:09:41.660 --> 07:09:45.740
over the adjacent, which is 2,000 squared.

07:09:46.060 --> 07:09:54.140
Oops, I just realized I got a small error up here. It should be d theta dt. We're taking the respect to time.

07:09:54.780 --> 07:09:58.060
The change in the angle with respect to time is what we're solving for.

07:10:01.020 --> 07:10:07.100
The change in the height, we know the height is increasing at 400 feet per second.

07:10:09.260 --> 07:10:12.460
The change in the height is 400 feet per second.

07:10:13.180 --> 07:10:16.300
Then we start multiplying this out.

07:10:17.740 --> 07:10:23.180
We will do the 2,000 times 2061.55 over 2,000 squared.

07:10:23.740 --> 07:10:31.260
When I do all of that, I get 2125 approximately d theta dt

07:10:32.140 --> 07:10:46.540
equals the 400, so the change in the angle with respect to time after I divide is 400 over 2125,

07:10:47.900 --> 07:10:56.620
which if I divide that, I get 0.1882 radians per second.

07:10:56.940 --> 07:11:06.540
So when this rocket is 500 feet in the air, the camera needs to be changing its angle at 0.1882 radians per second.

07:11:10.140 --> 07:11:13.660
Let's do one last example of these related rates.

07:11:14.220 --> 07:11:19.100
Finding an equation that relates the rates, taking a derivative with respect to time,

07:11:20.540 --> 07:11:23.180
plugging in what we know, and solving.

07:11:23.180 --> 07:11:30.140
Let's say I have a funnel and water is draining from it.

07:11:30.140 --> 07:11:31.500
Water is draining

07:11:36.940 --> 07:11:41.420
from a cone-shaped funnel.

07:11:42.380 --> 07:11:56.300
At a rate of 0.25 cubic feet per second.

07:12:02.780 --> 07:12:03.740
The height of the funnel

07:12:11.820 --> 07:12:12.540
is 3 feet.

07:12:19.500 --> 07:12:20.940
And the radius at the top

07:12:26.620 --> 07:12:27.340
is 2 feet.

07:12:32.780 --> 07:12:35.660
But we're not interested in the funnel, we want to know about the water.

07:12:35.660 --> 07:12:36.620
At what rate

07:12:42.220 --> 07:12:43.100
is the height

07:12:48.060 --> 07:12:48.780
of the water

07:12:53.660 --> 07:12:54.140
changing

07:13:00.140 --> 07:13:00.940
when the height

07:13:04.620 --> 07:13:05.500
is 1 foot?

07:13:11.420 --> 07:13:15.180
Well, let's draw a picture of our funnel.

07:13:17.260 --> 07:13:18.140
Here's our funnel.

07:13:20.060 --> 07:13:21.180
Water is leaking out.

07:13:23.580 --> 07:13:26.140
It's not full though, so here's the water level.

07:13:28.220 --> 07:13:31.660
The funnel itself we know is 3 feet high.

07:13:34.220 --> 07:13:36.540
The radius on the funnel is 2 feet.

07:13:36.620 --> 07:13:42.860
That's a constant, so we'll label those constants.

07:13:42.860 --> 07:13:48.140
We know water is coming out at 0.025 feet per second.

07:13:48.140 --> 07:13:52.300
So we'll call that negative 0.25 feet per second.

07:13:54.060 --> 07:13:55.580
Cubic feet per second.

07:13:55.580 --> 07:13:56.220
It's a volume.

07:13:59.740 --> 07:14:02.140
We're interested specifically in the water.

07:14:02.140 --> 07:14:05.420
We don't really know the radius and the height because that's going to change.

07:14:06.140 --> 07:14:07.180
Those aren't constant.

07:14:09.900 --> 07:14:13.820
But what we do know is an equation about the volume of that water.

07:14:14.540 --> 07:14:17.820
You might have to look it up or we might know that the volume of a cone

07:14:18.620 --> 07:14:22.860
is 1 third pi r squared times the height.

07:14:25.340 --> 07:14:29.660
The problem we have is we end up with three variables.

07:14:29.660 --> 07:14:32.780
And so if we were to take the derivative, we'd have three rates of change.

07:14:32.780 --> 07:14:34.620
The change in the height, the change in the radius,

07:14:34.620 --> 07:14:36.220
and the change in the volume.

07:14:36.220 --> 07:14:40.300
We want to reduce that down to 2, so it's a little more manageable.

07:14:41.180 --> 07:14:47.740
Fortunately, if we were to draw a line down the middle,

07:14:47.740 --> 07:14:51.500
you see we end up with triangles that make up kind of the right side,

07:14:52.460 --> 07:14:55.740
a big triangle with a height of 3 and a length of 2,

07:14:56.620 --> 07:15:03.420
and a small triangle with a height of h and a radius of r.

07:15:05.020 --> 07:15:10.780
Those triangles, because they both have a right angle and sharing angle,

07:15:10.780 --> 07:15:14.060
are similar triangles, so their sides must be proportional.

07:15:14.700 --> 07:15:19.260
In other words, if we set up the radius divided by the height on the little triangle,

07:15:19.820 --> 07:15:24.300
it would be the same on the big triangle, a radius of 2 divided by the height of 3.

07:15:25.820 --> 07:15:29.980
And we can solve this for r really quickly by multiplying by h.

07:15:29.980 --> 07:15:33.180
r is equal to 2h over 3.

07:15:35.580 --> 07:15:39.340
And so let's plug that in to our radius.

07:15:39.340 --> 07:15:42.060
That's going to reduce out the radius variable,

07:15:42.060 --> 07:15:45.100
because we really don't care about the radius.

07:15:45.100 --> 07:15:53.100
We care about the height, and we care about the volume of the water decreasing.

07:15:53.100 --> 07:15:55.580
We've got height and we've got volume.

07:15:55.580 --> 07:15:58.780
We do not have anything about the radius, so let's stick with that pattern.

07:15:59.180 --> 07:16:09.580
So our volume is 1 third pi times the radius, which is 2h over 3 squared times h.

07:16:11.500 --> 07:16:14.060
And actually, let's go ahead and simplify that.

07:16:14.060 --> 07:16:18.060
We've got 1 third pi times 2 squared is 4,

07:16:18.060 --> 07:16:24.220
h squared over 3 squared is 9 times the height.

07:16:24.860 --> 07:16:32.860
And so our final formula that connects the variables of the height and the volume.

07:16:33.740 --> 07:16:35.180
Oops, not 1 third.

07:16:35.180 --> 07:16:36.060
Let's multiply.

07:16:36.060 --> 07:16:40.700
1 times 4 is 4, 3 times 9 is 27.

07:16:41.260 --> 07:16:51.500
So we've got 4 pi over 27 times the height cubed.

07:16:54.220 --> 07:17:05.180
Now that we have our formula connecting our variables, we'll take the derivative.

07:17:05.180 --> 07:17:10.380
The derivative of v is 1 dv dt, the change in the volume with respect to time.

07:17:12.620 --> 07:17:20.380
4 pi over 27 is a constant, but the derivative of h cubed is h squared with the 3 out front

07:17:21.340 --> 07:17:22.540
times dh dt.

07:17:27.420 --> 07:17:28.540
Let's go ahead and simplify.

07:17:28.540 --> 07:17:41.180
3 over 27 is 9, so dv dt is equal to 4 pi over 9 h squared dh dt.

07:17:43.980 --> 07:17:46.780
Let's come over here to the side and plug in what we know.

07:17:47.660 --> 07:17:52.540
dv dt, that's the change in the volume with respect to time.

07:17:52.540 --> 07:17:57.100
We said the volume was decreasing at 0.25 cubic feet per second.

07:17:57.100 --> 07:18:02.860
Decreasing, so it's negative, 0.25 is equal to 4 pi over 9.

07:18:05.980 --> 07:18:09.740
The height that the moment we care about, the moment we care about

07:18:10.540 --> 07:18:18.460
is 1 feet, so we're going to put 1 in for our height at the moment we care about,

07:18:19.740 --> 07:18:26.220
squared, dh dt, that's what we're looking for, the change in the height with respect to time.

07:18:27.100 --> 07:18:37.740
So we have negative 0.25 is equal to 1 squared is 1 times 4 is 4 pi over 9 dh dt.

07:18:40.460 --> 07:18:49.660
And so to get dh dt alone, we multiply by 9 over 4 pi times the negative 0.25

07:18:52.460 --> 07:18:55.100
and the change in height with respect to time

07:18:57.180 --> 07:19:08.620
is equal to approximately, putting that in the calculator, negative 0.17914 feet per second.

07:19:10.380 --> 07:19:17.500
In other words, at that moment the height is decreasing by almost 0.18 feet per second.

07:19:21.100 --> 07:19:25.100
And that's how we're going to handle these related rates. We're going to take a look at drawing a

07:19:25.100 --> 07:19:30.060
picture, finding a formula that relates the variables of interest, the variables that are

07:19:30.060 --> 07:19:36.300
changing specifically, then we'll take the derivative with respect to time implicitly

07:19:37.100 --> 07:19:42.700
and then we'll plug in what we know and solve for what we don't know. Give a couple of those

07:19:42.700 --> 07:19:47.100
some practice on the assignment and we will see you in class to discuss this further.

07:19:49.740 --> 07:19:56.060
Sometimes it is easier to use a derivative to approximate the value of a equation or a function

07:19:56.060 --> 07:20:01.340
than it is to actually calculate the exact value and that's what we're going to take a look at

07:20:01.420 --> 07:20:19.820
today. The question is going to be how do we approximate a function at a point?

07:20:20.780 --> 07:20:32.140
And to set this up we're going to start by asking the why it works or what's going on in the background,

07:20:33.020 --> 07:20:41.020
the why, behind what we call linear approximation.

07:20:51.500 --> 07:20:54.860
To set this up we're going to recall the equation of a tangent line.

07:21:03.020 --> 07:21:15.820
To the function f of x at the point a

07:21:18.780 --> 07:21:19.260
is

07:21:22.540 --> 07:21:27.100
y equals the y-coordinate which is just f of a

07:21:27.820 --> 07:21:33.580
plus the slope of the tangent line at a which is f prime of a

07:21:35.740 --> 07:21:38.540
times x minus the point which is a.

07:21:41.740 --> 07:21:47.180
And what we also know is that close to the point, close to a,

07:21:47.820 --> 07:21:52.380
it is close

07:21:55.820 --> 07:22:02.700
to f of a. In other words, here's what I mean. Let's say I've got this curve here

07:22:06.460 --> 07:22:10.860
and there's this point on the curve that we're going to call a

07:22:10.940 --> 07:22:16.220
and we calculate this tangent line at a

07:22:19.420 --> 07:22:23.020
and if I look at a value that is close to a

07:22:29.020 --> 07:22:34.700
it's also going to be close to the point of the line. It's also going to be a very similar height.

07:22:34.780 --> 07:22:45.180
It's going to be close to f of a. It's off by a little bit but that line can give us a really good

07:22:45.180 --> 07:22:50.940
estimation of what's happening close to the point a as it curves away from a.

07:22:52.620 --> 07:22:55.820
And the fact of the matter is lines

07:22:58.540 --> 07:22:59.420
are easier

07:22:59.980 --> 07:23:03.180
than curves

07:23:05.980 --> 07:23:07.180
to calculate points.

07:23:13.100 --> 07:23:17.500
And so we're going to prefer to use that blue line that gets us close to a

07:23:18.780 --> 07:23:22.300
to calculate what's actually happening close to a.

07:23:23.580 --> 07:23:26.380
Maybe this will look better with a more concrete example.

07:23:27.100 --> 07:23:28.620
Let's take a look at

07:23:30.860 --> 07:23:31.420
example.

07:23:33.740 --> 07:23:39.500
Let's say we were trying to calculate the square root of 25.1 by hand.

07:23:40.940 --> 07:23:44.860
That would be very very difficult because it doesn't have a perfect square root. We know it's

07:23:44.860 --> 07:23:51.100
close to five because the square root of 25 is five and that's the fact that we're going to use

07:23:51.100 --> 07:24:00.380
in order to estimate it. We know that the square root of 25.1 is close to the square root of 25.

07:24:03.020 --> 07:24:04.540
So we can consider.

07:24:08.300 --> 07:24:13.500
Let's say the function f of x is equal to the square root of x or as we like to have it in

07:24:13.500 --> 07:24:15.500
calculus x to the one half.

07:24:18.220 --> 07:24:24.380
Then f prime of x the derivative is one half times x to the negative one half

07:24:25.980 --> 07:24:29.500
or one over two square root of x.

07:24:33.260 --> 07:24:41.100
We need to know what f of 25 the easy point and f prime of 25 is

07:24:42.060 --> 07:24:48.140
in order to estimate the not so easy point of the square root of 25.1.

07:24:49.420 --> 07:24:53.420
Well f of 25 is the square root of 25 which we know is five

07:24:55.260 --> 07:25:02.300
and f prime of 25 is one over two times the square root of 25 or one over two times five

07:25:03.500 --> 07:25:04.060
one tenth.

07:25:04.780 --> 07:25:11.980
So if we want the linear approximation

07:25:17.660 --> 07:25:23.100
of the square root of x at 25

07:25:26.700 --> 07:25:30.300
that's just the equation of our tangent line.

07:25:30.620 --> 07:25:33.820
The y coordinate of five

07:25:36.780 --> 07:25:40.220
plus the slope which is the derivative one tenth

07:25:41.500 --> 07:25:45.340
times x minus the x coordinate which is 25.

07:25:48.060 --> 07:25:55.500
We can use this linear equation to estimate the square root of numbers very close to 25.

07:25:55.820 --> 07:25:58.220
So we can estimate

07:26:01.500 --> 07:26:11.820
the square root of 25.1 by using x is equal to 25.1 in this equation.

07:26:12.220 --> 07:26:25.340
So the linearization at 25.1 is equal to five plus one tenth times 25.1 minus 25

07:26:27.340 --> 07:26:33.900
and if we plug that into our calculator we will get that the answer is approximately

07:26:33.900 --> 07:26:43.740
5.01 and so we're estimating that the square root of 25.1 is about 5.01.

07:26:46.300 --> 07:26:51.100
So I know what you're thinking how good is that estimate? Well let's actually find it on the

07:26:51.100 --> 07:27:01.260
calculator we did it by hand we're going to compare with the square root of 25.1 on our calculator.

07:27:02.060 --> 07:27:16.060
So on my calculator I will do the square root of 25.1 and we get 5.00999 that's pretty darn

07:27:16.780 --> 07:27:29.740
close 5.00999 it is quite close to our estimated value that we found by hand

07:27:29.740 --> 07:27:34.540
and doing it by hand with the square root would have been a real big pain because curves are

07:27:34.540 --> 07:27:41.420
difficult to calculate but lines are much easier to work with and so that's this idea of linear

07:27:41.420 --> 07:27:46.700
approximation is we're going to estimate by finding the equation of the tangent line

07:27:46.700 --> 07:27:55.820
to see what's happening really close. So let's try some examples see if we can get good at this

07:27:56.300 --> 07:28:00.780
first example we're going to estimate

07:28:04.700 --> 07:28:08.140
1 over 3.1 squared

07:28:13.900 --> 07:28:21.260
well the function that we seem to be working with is we're doing 1 over x squared or x to the negative

07:28:21.260 --> 07:28:31.820
2 and then we can make the x equal to 3 so f prime the derivative of that is negative 2

07:28:31.820 --> 07:28:46.700
x to the negative 3 or negative 2 over x cubed 3.1 is close to 3

07:28:46.780 --> 07:28:53.980
so we're going to find f of 3 and f prime of 3 and then we'll see what's happening

07:28:53.980 --> 07:29:00.940
close to that so f of 3 is equal to 1 over 3 squared which we know is 1 ninth

07:29:03.020 --> 07:29:11.900
f prime of 3 is negative 2 over 3 cubed which is negative 2 over 27

07:29:17.660 --> 07:29:24.940
so let's set up our linear approximation is equal to the y-coordinate of 1 ninth

07:29:27.740 --> 07:29:37.420
plus the slope which is negative 2 over 27 times x minus the x-coordinate the x-coordinate is 3

07:29:38.140 --> 07:29:47.740
we can use this to estimate 1 over x squared near the point 3 we're particularly interested

07:29:48.620 --> 07:29:59.420
in 3.1 so 1 ninth minus 2 over 27 times 3.1 minus 3

07:30:00.060 --> 07:30:09.820
and if I plug 3.1 into that into my calculator we get 0.1037

07:30:13.660 --> 07:30:21.260
so let's check it on the calculator what is 1 over 3.1 squared

07:30:22.060 --> 07:30:33.180
1 divided by 3.1 squared let's see how close we got it's 0.1041

07:30:39.420 --> 07:30:46.860
and as you can see that is quite close we're only off by about 0.0004

07:30:47.820 --> 07:30:54.060
not too bad of an estimate doing it by hand was much nicer than doing 3.1 squared getting

07:30:54.060 --> 07:31:00.220
in something with two decimal points and then doing that long division much nicer

07:31:00.220 --> 07:31:04.300
this even works with trigonometry let's do a trig example

07:31:04.380 --> 07:31:09.180
let's estimate

07:31:12.540 --> 07:31:16.060
the tangent of 44 degrees

07:31:20.140 --> 07:31:27.180
well let's change that to radians first we see that's close to 45

07:31:27.900 --> 07:31:39.980
so we're really working with the tangent of 45 degrees and if you remember your unit circle

07:31:40.700 --> 07:31:44.460
45 degrees is pi over 4

07:31:48.060 --> 07:31:54.860
so we're looking at the tangent of pi over 4 to estimate our point

07:31:57.740 --> 07:32:06.940
so f of x is the tangent of a value tangent of any point we're going to find that point

07:32:07.580 --> 07:32:11.100
f prime we know is the secant squared of x

07:32:16.460 --> 07:32:24.540
we're specifically interested in pi over 2 so f of pi over 2 is equal to the tangent

07:32:24.780 --> 07:32:33.420
i'm sorry not pi over 2 pi over 4 the tangent of pi over 4 we should remember is equal to 1

07:32:36.060 --> 07:32:42.540
and f prime of pi over 4 is the secant squared of pi over 4

07:32:45.660 --> 07:32:52.780
if it helps to remember secant is 1 over cosine cosine is the x-coordinate 2 root 2 over 2

07:32:53.740 --> 07:32:59.340
the reciprocal of that is going to be actually i'll write down what i'm talking about here at the top

07:33:01.740 --> 07:33:09.020
so it's 1 over the cosine of pi over 4 which is 1 over root 2 over 2

07:33:10.140 --> 07:33:13.980
which is the reciprocal of that 2 over the square root of 2

07:33:14.940 --> 07:33:22.700
and if i rationalize we get 2 root 2 over 2 which is equal to just the square root of 2

07:33:25.100 --> 07:33:31.660
so square root of 2 is the secant but that's squared so it's actually equal

07:33:34.060 --> 07:33:41.020
square root of 2 squared is just 2 remembering your trig from secant how does that work

07:33:41.740 --> 07:33:43.660
secant of pi over 4 is equal to 2

07:33:47.260 --> 07:33:53.420
all right let's make our linearization equation then l of x is equal to the y-coordinate of 1

07:33:55.420 --> 07:33:58.140
plus the slope of 2

07:34:01.260 --> 07:34:05.100
times x minus the x-coordinate which is pi over 4

07:34:11.020 --> 07:34:20.700
but we want the linearization of 44 degrees which we have to change that 44 degrees into radians 44 degrees

07:34:23.180 --> 07:34:29.820
remember we multiply that by pi over 180 so we have 44 pi over 180

07:34:32.380 --> 07:34:35.420
radians there's no reason to reduce because we're going to use our calculator

07:34:36.060 --> 07:34:42.060
so we're doing the linearization of 44 pi over 180

07:34:48.460 --> 07:34:56.860
is equal to 1 plus 2 times 44 pi over 180 minus pi over 4

07:34:57.500 --> 07:35:07.260
plugging that mess into our calculator we get 0.9651

07:35:12.620 --> 07:35:19.100
so that's our estimate let's check it with the actual value of the tangent of 44 degrees

07:35:19.100 --> 07:35:25.020
and since our calculator is probably in radian mode let's do the 44 pi over 180

07:35:27.020 --> 07:35:42.220
verify that my mode is in radians yes so we've got the tangent of 44 pi divided by 180

07:35:42.780 --> 07:35:50.060
and it equals 0.9657

07:35:50.940 --> 07:36:01.020
0.9657 and look how close the actual value was it was only off by 0.0006

07:36:02.380 --> 07:36:03.820
only a 20th of a percent

07:36:04.140 --> 07:36:13.180
so we have this idea that we can get close to any curve using a tangent line and so if I move a

07:36:13.180 --> 07:36:18.220
little bit to the right or if I move a little bit to the left I can see what's happening

07:36:19.420 --> 07:36:24.780
kind of near that point but it kind of begs this question how much are we off by how much are we

07:36:24.780 --> 07:36:33.100
changing by this kind of leads into this concept of what we call differentials

07:36:35.820 --> 07:36:42.140
how much are we off by as x changes how much does y change in relationship to x is there

07:36:42.140 --> 07:36:49.100
a relationship there a differential is really just the amount a function changes

07:36:55.020 --> 07:36:55.980
as a result

07:36:59.820 --> 07:37:04.060
of a small change I'm going to move this up

07:37:08.700 --> 07:37:11.660
as a result of a small change in x

07:37:13.900 --> 07:37:20.780
not the amount the amount the amount of function changes as a result of a small change in x

07:37:21.100 --> 07:37:30.300
so we know that dy dx is equal to the derivative of the function

07:37:35.260 --> 07:37:46.860
dy though is representing a change in y a small change in y and dx is representing a small

07:37:47.660 --> 07:37:54.300
change in x it's the change in y with respect x what's happening how are things changing

07:37:54.300 --> 07:38:01.500
really close to that point so if we want to know how much the y's are changing if we multiply both

07:38:01.500 --> 07:38:18.700
sides by dx then we get that dy is equal to f prime of x dx and this formula

07:38:20.380 --> 07:38:30.700
is the formula for a differential it tells us for every small change in y it's equal to the

07:38:30.700 --> 07:38:39.340
derivative of the function times the small change in x so if I was asked to find the differential

07:38:39.340 --> 07:38:55.180
equation of y equals four x squared minus secant x first we can take the derivative

07:38:55.900 --> 07:39:03.260
which is dy dx equals 8x minus secant x tangent x

07:39:06.860 --> 07:39:12.220
and then multiply both sides by the dx so that we can see what a small change in y does

07:39:13.100 --> 07:39:20.220
it's equal to whatever 8x minus secant x tangent x dx equals

07:39:21.180 --> 07:39:27.260
so now if I know the amount of that small change in x I could plug that into this equation

07:39:28.140 --> 07:39:37.180
and estimate how y is changing for a given small change in x in fact let's do an example equation

07:39:38.140 --> 07:39:44.380
where we do just that let's find the differential

07:39:49.820 --> 07:39:52.780
and evaluate

07:39:57.740 --> 07:40:05.020
when x is equal to zero and the small change in x dx is equal to point two

07:40:07.420 --> 07:40:15.980
and let's do the function y equals 5x minus three over 2x plus one

07:40:19.020 --> 07:40:25.260
what we're asking for is at the point zero on this function if the x changes a little bit if the x

07:40:25.260 --> 07:40:30.860
changes by point two how much would we expect the y to change by what's the little bit y changes by

07:40:32.140 --> 07:40:36.060
well for this one it's going to be quite a dramatic change because of its structure

07:40:36.620 --> 07:40:43.180
first we have to find the derivative dy dx and we know the derivative of a fraction is the

07:40:43.180 --> 07:40:50.220
derivative of the top times the bottom minus the derivative of the bottom times the top

07:40:51.740 --> 07:40:58.780
and so that gives us five times 2x plus one minus two times 5x minus three all over the

07:40:58.780 --> 07:41:08.300
bottom squared the 2x plus one squared let's clean that up a little bit five times two let's

07:41:08.300 --> 07:41:19.340
distribute is 10x plus five minus distributing the negative two through 10x plus six over 2x plus

07:41:19.340 --> 07:41:26.860
one squared and that's nice because the 10x is subtract out to zero so we're left with

07:41:29.420 --> 07:41:33.020
11 over 2x plus one squared

07:41:36.140 --> 07:41:39.340
to get the differential we just multiply both sides by the dx

07:41:41.100 --> 07:41:48.140
and we find that the differential in y the change in y the difference in y is equal to 11

07:41:49.340 --> 07:41:54.300
over 2x plus one squared dx

07:41:57.340 --> 07:42:05.820
now we're asked to evaluate it evaluate what the change in y is when x is zero and the change in x

07:42:05.820 --> 07:42:13.340
is point two well we'll estimate that as 11 over two times x which is zero plus one squared

07:42:14.140 --> 07:42:21.500
times the differential times the point two which comes out to be 11 times point two

07:42:22.780 --> 07:42:26.700
over one which is 2.2

07:42:29.500 --> 07:42:35.340
so at the point zero when x changes point two we're going to expect the y to change by about

07:42:35.340 --> 07:42:40.140
2.2 and that's how we can find that differential and see kind of that

07:42:40.860 --> 07:42:46.700
estimated change at the point so the big thing for today though is linearization to

07:42:46.700 --> 07:42:51.660
estimate a point and we also took a little bit of a look at differentials take a look at those

07:42:51.660 --> 07:42:59.900
practice a few and we will see you in class one of the most important things the derivative

07:42:59.900 --> 07:43:06.940
can tell us is where the minimum and maximum points are on a function so that's what the question

07:43:06.940 --> 07:43:25.180
we're going to look at today is how do we identify the minimum or the maximum points of a function

07:43:28.780 --> 07:43:35.020
and to set this up there's a little bit of vocabulary that we need to be familiar with

07:43:35.020 --> 07:43:42.140
as we work with this concept and to help us kind of visualize the vocabulary I'm going to put a

07:43:42.140 --> 07:43:48.780
function here let's say it's going to start at zero it's going to come down come up really high

07:43:49.500 --> 07:43:58.460
go down really low come up a little bit and then go towards an asymptote at zero okay

07:43:58.460 --> 07:44:07.580
okay the first vocabulary word we need to know is what is the absolute minimum

07:44:11.420 --> 07:44:16.940
and quite simply the absolute minimum is the lowest point

07:44:20.860 --> 07:44:24.780
so let's actually give this graph that we just made some coordinates here

07:44:25.500 --> 07:44:33.340
let's call this we'll just make it one two up and one two down so you can see that the absolute

07:44:33.340 --> 07:44:49.340
minimum the absolute lowest point is at x is at y equals negative two it's down low y equals negative

07:44:49.340 --> 07:45:01.980
two the other word we need to know is as you might expect the absolute maximum

07:45:04.700 --> 07:45:09.260
as you might expect is the highest point on the graph

07:45:11.740 --> 07:45:17.260
and so the highest point on this graph is up at this top peak we're going to call that the

07:45:17.260 --> 07:45:24.620
absolute maximum and you see that's at a height of two y equals two is the absolute maximum of this

07:45:24.620 --> 07:45:36.140
graph we can kind of generalize this idea of absoluteness with what we call the absolute

07:45:36.540 --> 07:45:38.540
extrema

07:45:43.580 --> 07:45:46.860
and that is basically just talking about both the absolute

07:45:51.500 --> 07:45:56.780
max and min together so when I say what are the absolute extrema I'm asking what's the absolute

07:45:56.780 --> 07:46:04.140
maximum and what's the absolute minimum but we don't just have absolute maximums and minimums we

07:46:04.140 --> 07:46:20.300
also have what we call local minimums which we'll say is the lowest point in the area

07:46:22.700 --> 07:46:26.780
so there's nobody lower around here so we're going to call it the absolute

07:46:26.780 --> 07:46:31.740
minimum and you'll see we've got a little dip off to the right we can call the

07:46:32.380 --> 07:46:34.380
oops

07:46:36.620 --> 07:46:44.460
we can call that the local minimum because it's kind of a valley it's not the lowest

07:46:44.460 --> 07:46:49.980
valley but it is the lowest valley in the area so that's going to be at y equals negative one

07:46:53.020 --> 07:46:56.460
and similarly we can have a local maximum

07:46:57.180 --> 07:47:05.900
which as you would expect is the highest point in the area

07:47:10.540 --> 07:47:16.620
and the local maximum you'll see off to the right with this little peak is the local max

07:47:17.420 --> 07:47:21.260
it's the highest mountain in the area it's just not the highest mountain

07:47:21.260 --> 07:47:25.820
overall and that one has a height of one so we would say that is y equals one

07:47:28.460 --> 07:47:32.780
and similarly we can lump those together and call them the local extrema

07:47:37.100 --> 07:47:43.100
which is all the local min maxes grouped together

07:47:43.180 --> 07:47:52.060
what's interesting about all of these points though is if we notice the derivative or the

07:47:52.060 --> 07:48:02.940
tangent line at each of these points is always going to be a flat line the derivative at each

07:48:02.940 --> 07:48:12.940
of these points is equal to zero they have a slope of zero slope of zero slope of zero and

07:48:12.940 --> 07:48:20.700
slope of zero anytime the slope is zero that's going to identify one of these local min or

07:48:20.700 --> 07:48:27.020
local max and possibly an absolute min or max we have a special name for those points those are

07:48:27.020 --> 07:48:41.420
called critical points critical points are a point where the derivative

07:48:44.540 --> 07:48:48.540
is either zero or undefined

07:48:48.780 --> 07:48:59.340
and what's really important there is it might be a local extremum

07:49:02.380 --> 07:49:07.740
it's not guaranteed to be a local min or a local max or even an absolute min or an absolute max

07:49:07.740 --> 07:49:16.380
but it certainly is a very good candidate for that to occur so using this idea

07:49:18.540 --> 07:49:26.220
this leads into getting away from the vocabulary now this leads into what we call the extreme

07:49:29.020 --> 07:49:31.500
value theorem

07:49:34.380 --> 07:49:42.940
or affectionately called the evt extreme value theorem and basically the extreme value theorem

07:49:42.940 --> 07:49:47.900
states that if a function f is continuous

07:49:52.060 --> 07:49:54.860
on an interval between a and b

07:49:58.700 --> 07:50:02.780
then there is

07:50:05.980 --> 07:50:07.420
an absolute

07:50:13.420 --> 07:50:14.060
maximum

07:50:22.220 --> 07:50:22.940
on a b

07:50:26.300 --> 07:50:31.740
and in absolute minimum

07:50:38.780 --> 07:50:39.500
on a b

07:50:43.180 --> 07:50:47.340
in other words if we take a closed interval somewhere on that interval is going to be a

07:50:47.340 --> 07:50:52.140
maximum and somewhere on that interval is going to be a minimum and what's really important to

07:50:52.140 --> 07:51:02.140
note is the min and max points are either

07:51:06.140 --> 07:51:11.020
a the first point of the interval b the end of the interval

07:51:13.020 --> 07:51:18.620
or what we're going to call c

07:51:20.700 --> 07:51:24.620
they're either at a b or c where c

07:51:27.980 --> 07:51:38.380
is when the derivative at that point equals zero or where c is a critical point

07:51:43.180 --> 07:51:49.420
what this is really saying is find the critical points

07:51:55.580 --> 07:51:59.420
and test these points

07:52:02.460 --> 07:52:03.900
and the edges

07:52:04.380 --> 07:52:15.820
and either the critical points or the edges are going to be your minimums and or your maximums

07:52:18.940 --> 07:52:26.540
let's take a look at what we mean by that let's say that f of x is equal to two x cubed

07:52:27.260 --> 07:52:35.740
minus three x squared minus 12x plus five and we're going to look on the interval from zero

07:52:35.740 --> 07:52:41.340
to four to find the absolute minimum and the absolute maximum in that range

07:52:44.620 --> 07:52:49.660
well first we have to find the critical points and that's when the derivative is equal to zero

07:52:51.580 --> 07:52:56.220
because it might level off and come back down so where is that derivative equal to zero

07:52:56.220 --> 07:53:04.940
well the derivative is 6x squared minus 6x minus 12 and we'll set that equal to zero

07:53:06.940 --> 07:53:15.020
solving we factor out a six x squared minus x minus two continuing to factor we have x minus

07:53:15.020 --> 07:53:22.700
two times x plus one and so we've got two potential critical points two and negative one

07:53:22.700 --> 07:53:26.620
these are the critical points

07:53:33.500 --> 07:53:36.700
that's where the derivative is zero that's where it levels off

07:53:36.700 --> 07:53:41.260
however we need to be careful all we really care about is numbers between zero and four

07:53:41.260 --> 07:53:45.020
so negative one doesn't really help us because it's outside of the range

07:53:47.020 --> 07:53:50.780
so now we know our critical points we just have to test what is f

07:53:51.340 --> 07:53:56.940
of the critical point what is f of the edge and f of the other edge

07:53:58.460 --> 07:54:03.900
one of those is the minimum and one of those is the maximum and one we don't really care about

07:54:04.540 --> 07:54:05.820
so let's get our calculator

07:54:12.460 --> 07:54:18.540
let's get y equals clear out any function that might be in there and let's just type our function

07:54:18.540 --> 07:54:21.500
in here 2x cubed

07:54:25.740 --> 07:54:36.380
minus 3x squared minus 12x plus five

07:54:38.220 --> 07:54:42.940
and we'll hit second table so that we can enter in our own values and let's delete out the values

07:54:42.940 --> 07:54:51.340
we don't care about so we're interested in when x is two when x is zero and when x is four

07:54:53.580 --> 07:54:57.980
and you see our y's are negative 15 five and 37

07:55:00.860 --> 07:55:04.460
negative 15 five and 37

07:55:04.860 --> 07:55:13.660
and we can see on there that negative 15 is the minimum number the 37 is the maximum number

07:55:13.660 --> 07:55:22.300
we don't care about the zero but we have a maximum of 37 at x equals four

07:55:23.820 --> 07:55:30.540
and we have a minimum of negative 15 at x equals two

07:55:31.500 --> 07:55:39.100
we've identified our minimum and maximum using the extreme value theorem or EVT

07:55:39.980 --> 07:55:42.620
for this function on this range

07:55:46.860 --> 07:55:48.940
let's try one more that might be a little more open

07:55:49.260 --> 07:55:55.340
let's see what happens when we say f of x

07:55:57.900 --> 07:56:07.020
equals cosine squared of x and we're going to do it on negative infinity to infinity

07:56:11.980 --> 07:56:16.140
it's not really a closed interval but the extreme value theorem should still apply here

07:56:16.140 --> 07:56:19.420
we can't check the extremes of negative infinity and positive infinity

07:56:19.420 --> 07:56:23.500
but we certainly can check the critical points to see if there's any minimums

07:56:23.500 --> 07:56:31.260
or maximums so first f prime of x the derivative it's a chain rule so we have two times the cosine

07:56:31.260 --> 07:56:34.700
of x times the derivative of cosine which is sine

07:56:35.180 --> 07:56:45.100
and we want to know when that derivative is equal to zero

07:56:46.300 --> 07:56:49.740
well it's already factored we just have the cosine of x equals zero

07:56:50.700 --> 07:56:52.460
and the sine of x equals zero

07:56:54.700 --> 07:57:00.060
first thinking about the cosine of x on our unit circle cosine of x is equal to zero

07:57:00.140 --> 07:57:05.180
cosine is the x coordinate it's equal to zero at the top and at the bottom

07:57:05.900 --> 07:57:14.780
which means x here is equal to pi over two and then we move a pi over to three pi over two

07:57:15.420 --> 07:57:18.380
so it's pi over two plus

07:57:20.940 --> 07:57:29.580
n pi's every pi around and n can be any num any element of the integers we'll say

07:57:29.580 --> 07:57:35.660
n is some integer one two three four or it could be negative one negative two negative three negative four

07:57:40.700 --> 07:57:41.740
for sine of x

07:57:44.940 --> 07:57:50.780
sine of x is going to be the x coordinates i'm sorry the y coordinates and the y coordinates

07:57:50.780 --> 07:58:01.420
are zero here at zero and pi so sine of x tells us that x is equal to pi plus n pi

07:58:04.220 --> 07:58:10.700
well let's go to our calculator and see what we have for min's and max's hitting y equals clearing

07:58:10.700 --> 07:58:19.500
out the old function we want to do parentheses the cosine of x and we want to square it

07:58:21.340 --> 07:58:24.940
to lead out the old values for the table

07:58:27.100 --> 07:58:29.660
and our first point is pi over two

07:58:34.220 --> 07:58:43.420
we get zero add n pi so we've got pi over two plus one pi

07:58:43.500 --> 07:58:52.460
we get zero again and pi over two plus two pi

07:58:54.620 --> 07:59:01.500
we get zero again and again so what we see is each of these guys is going to give us zero for a height

07:59:05.260 --> 07:59:08.780
let's try the other ones let's just try pi and plus n pi

07:59:09.740 --> 07:59:14.780
from our second from the sine so just pi pi is equal to one

07:59:17.900 --> 07:59:27.900
what if we do pi plus pi pi plus one pi also equal to one what about pi plus two pi

07:59:27.900 --> 07:59:38.060
also equal to one what we see is each of these always equals two one

07:59:39.020 --> 07:59:43.420
so we're going to have not an absolute max or an absolute min because it doesn't

07:59:43.420 --> 07:59:49.980
peak out but we do get these relative maximums and relative minimums so we can say the relative

07:59:50.220 --> 08:00:04.060
or not relative but local local minimum at x equals pi or let's say local minimum of

08:00:05.660 --> 08:00:11.420
zero at x equals pi over two plus n pi

08:00:11.580 --> 08:00:19.180
where n is an element of the integers and we have a local maximum

08:00:21.100 --> 08:00:27.020
of one at x equals pi plus n pi

08:00:29.020 --> 08:00:31.180
where n is an element of the integers again

08:00:32.060 --> 08:00:42.220
just to kind of see what's happening here if I were to actually graph this let's adjust our window

08:00:45.740 --> 08:00:52.220
window let's go from negative six pi

08:00:53.180 --> 08:00:55.020
to pi

08:00:57.740 --> 08:00:59.820
and I want to label every pi over two

08:01:02.860 --> 08:01:06.540
min I'm going to do a minimum of negative two and a maximum of two

08:01:09.500 --> 08:01:15.980
and when I graph it you see every pi over two there's either a local min or a local max

08:01:16.300 --> 08:01:25.340
I didn't do the window I wanted but it gets the idea here as we get a local min or a local max

08:01:25.340 --> 08:01:30.460
every pi over two based on what we just found and we know the heights one and the heights are zero

08:01:33.100 --> 08:01:39.900
so that's the big idea for today is the extreme value theorem that if f is continuous all we

08:01:39.900 --> 08:01:46.540
need to do is find the critical points and check the edges and one of those is going to be the local

08:01:46.540 --> 08:01:52.540
min or the absolute min and one of those is going to be the absolute max take a look at it on the

08:01:52.540 --> 08:01:58.540
homework today and we will see you in class to talk about the extreme value theorem a little bit more

08:02:00.220 --> 08:02:04.620
today we're going to take a look at what's called the mean value theorem the mean value theorem

08:02:04.620 --> 08:02:12.700
takes a look at answering the question when is the instantaneous

08:02:17.820 --> 08:02:18.940
rate of change

08:02:22.540 --> 08:02:30.380
or the rate of change at any specific moment equal to the average

08:02:31.340 --> 08:02:34.620
rate of change

08:02:39.820 --> 08:02:45.740
so for example if you go on a hour long trip and you average 40 miles an hour on that trip

08:02:46.780 --> 08:02:51.980
when were you actually driving 40 miles an hour sometimes you're driving faster sometimes you

08:02:51.980 --> 08:02:57.900
are driving slower but when were you actually equal to the 40 miles an hour or your average

08:02:57.900 --> 08:03:02.540
for the entire trip and this is what the mean value theorem finds for us

08:03:06.220 --> 08:03:07.500
the mean value theorem

08:03:09.900 --> 08:03:11.740
or sometimes called MVT

08:03:14.620 --> 08:03:19.980
first before we can use the mean value theorem there are two requirements

08:03:20.380 --> 08:03:32.140
that must be meant and if either of these are not true the mean value theorem does not apply

08:03:33.580 --> 08:03:36.140
first the function must be continuous

08:03:39.500 --> 08:03:42.300
on the range we're talking about from a to b

08:03:44.620 --> 08:03:48.060
and second it must be differential

08:03:50.460 --> 08:03:55.180
on that same range from a to b

08:03:57.900 --> 08:04:04.220
if the function is continuous between two numbers and is differentiable on those two

08:04:04.220 --> 08:04:12.540
numbers or between those two numbers then we can say that there exists

08:04:12.540 --> 08:04:16.940
at least

08:04:19.180 --> 08:04:22.620
one point c

08:04:25.420 --> 08:04:26.460
that is between

08:04:29.100 --> 08:04:29.660
a and b

08:04:32.620 --> 08:04:33.260
such that

08:04:33.740 --> 08:04:44.220
the derivative at that point is equal to the rate of change or the slope

08:04:45.660 --> 08:04:50.460
the f of b minus f of a over b minus a

08:04:56.700 --> 08:05:00.700
maybe to help us see this it might help to see it graphically what we're talking about

08:05:03.980 --> 08:05:07.180
graphically what we're saying is

08:05:09.180 --> 08:05:16.860
if I take a curve that goes from one point around up into another point

08:05:17.900 --> 08:05:24.700
from a to b where we've got f of a

08:05:24.940 --> 08:05:35.660
and f of b on the y-axis if I was to connect the point directly from a to b with a straight line

08:05:36.620 --> 08:05:42.380
that slope is going to be my average rate of change between the two points

08:05:43.660 --> 08:05:51.340
and what the mean value theorem states is that there is at least one point then in between them

08:05:51.340 --> 08:06:00.300
called c where this tangent line is parallel in other words the instantaneous rate of change

08:06:00.300 --> 08:06:05.340
at that point is the same as the average between a and b in fact you might notice that there's

08:06:05.340 --> 08:06:13.180
two points on this graph that give us a parallel slope so maybe we could call them c1 and c2

08:06:13.180 --> 08:06:19.740
this this graph actually has two points where the slope is equal to the average slope between

08:06:19.740 --> 08:06:24.780
the two points that's what the mean value theorem states is that there's a point in the middle

08:06:24.780 --> 08:06:29.740
that has the same tangent slope as the secant from a to b

08:06:35.020 --> 08:06:44.460
so first I mentioned the requirements of the mean value theorem it's always important to check

08:06:45.100 --> 08:06:52.060
the requirements is it differentiable is it continuous

08:06:55.020 --> 08:06:59.020
so we could ask the question does the mean value theorem

08:07:02.460 --> 08:07:02.940
apply

08:07:08.060 --> 08:07:11.500
or maybe it'd be better to say when does the mean value theorem apply

08:07:11.500 --> 08:07:13.820
let's change it to that when does

08:07:17.980 --> 08:07:20.540
the mean value theorem apply

08:07:23.260 --> 08:07:31.900
to y equals the square root of x squared minus x minus two

08:07:32.780 --> 08:07:45.340
well we could take the derivative of just about any point and it's continuous at just about every

08:07:45.340 --> 08:07:53.580
point except for one important point or one important thing what's under the square root

08:07:53.580 --> 08:08:00.940
must always be greater than or equal to zero so what we're really saying is x squared minus x minus

08:08:00.940 --> 08:08:07.260
two must be greater than or equal to zero for the mean value theorem to apply because that's the

08:08:07.260 --> 08:08:14.620
only time it's actually continuous well if we factor that we get x minus two times x plus one

08:08:14.620 --> 08:08:20.300
is greater than or equal to zero and so we find out we've got these two potential solutions of two

08:08:20.300 --> 08:08:25.820
and negative one and we want to know when those solutions are positive specifically

08:08:26.460 --> 08:08:34.780
so if I make a little graph here you can see we've got a zero at negative one and zero at two

08:08:35.420 --> 08:08:41.660
it's an x squared graph so we should know it's a parabola and specifically we want the graph to be

08:08:41.660 --> 08:08:48.380
positive we know it's positive on the left and the right but negative in the center when it's

08:08:48.380 --> 08:08:55.660
negative in the center the graph's not continuous so the range when the mean value theorem applies

08:08:55.900 --> 08:09:00.620
when it's actually continuous is from negative infinity to negative one

08:09:02.380 --> 08:09:05.420
and actually we'll include the negative one because it's continuous at zero

08:09:08.780 --> 08:09:17.180
union from two to infinity these are the points on which our

08:09:17.900 --> 08:09:23.500
graph is positive the graph of what's under the square root is positive meaning we can actually

08:09:23.500 --> 08:09:29.020
take the square root it's actually continuous on those points so those are the only ranges when

08:09:29.020 --> 08:09:39.020
the mean value theorem would apply we could even ask more directly does the mean value theorem apply

08:09:39.340 --> 08:09:54.460
to maybe y equals the natural log of 5x minus one over the interval from zero to three

08:10:00.860 --> 08:10:06.940
well we know the domain of the natural log what's inside the natural log must be greater than zero

08:10:06.940 --> 08:10:13.260
it can't even be equal to zero so what we need to check is 5x minus one greater than zero going to

08:10:13.260 --> 08:10:20.140
put us outside of the range of zero to three that this problem's interested in add one

08:10:21.260 --> 08:10:27.740
5x is greater than one divide by five x is must be greater than one fifth

08:10:27.740 --> 08:10:37.580
so we would say no the mean value theorem does not apply apply because it is undefined

08:10:40.540 --> 08:10:48.460
from zero to one fifth if we are just going from one to three the mean value theorem would work

08:10:48.460 --> 08:10:53.340
because it's defined on all those points it's continuous on all those points but because

08:10:53.340 --> 08:11:02.860
it's discontinuous from zero to one fifth the mean value theorem will not apply over the range of zero

08:11:02.860 --> 08:11:12.460
to three let's try another one y equals e to the three x squared minus one

08:11:13.260 --> 08:11:26.300
with e and with x squared and with multiplication and with subtraction we know the graph is

08:11:26.300 --> 08:11:35.420
continuous there's no jumps no breaks no holes no gaps it's also differentiable on the entire graph

08:11:36.300 --> 08:11:40.460
the derivative we'd have to use a nice little chain rule but if we took the derivative

08:11:40.460 --> 08:11:47.180
it would be e to the three x squared minus one times the derivative of the top stuff which is 6x

08:11:50.060 --> 08:11:57.420
and the minus one goes to zero but this is also defined on all points so there's nowhere this is

08:11:57.420 --> 08:12:04.380
not this is discontinuous there's nowhere where this is not differentiable i didn't even give the

08:12:04.380 --> 08:12:10.460
range but let's just give it one because i should have let's say over negative two to two definitely

08:12:10.460 --> 08:12:16.700
between negative two and two this is all defined so we would say yes the mean value theorem is going

08:12:16.700 --> 08:12:24.940
to apply to this function on this range which means between negative two and two the average rate of

08:12:24.940 --> 08:12:33.340
change can be found as an instantaneous rate of change we don't know where but we definitely know

08:12:33.340 --> 08:12:43.980
it exists okay then let's see now that we've checked the requirements let's see if we can use

08:12:44.540 --> 08:12:53.340
the mean value theorem first we're going to do it kind of visually i want to graph

08:12:53.420 --> 08:13:05.100
graph this function and connect the a and b and then show tangent lines

08:13:08.220 --> 08:13:14.220
there's at least one there might be more so i'll put the s in parentheses with the same slope

08:13:15.180 --> 08:13:27.980
so the graph we're working with is f of x equals x cubed minus 6x squared plus 8x

08:13:34.300 --> 08:13:40.860
so let's take an x out to try and graph it gives us x squared minus 6x plus 8

08:13:41.820 --> 08:13:53.260
continuing to factor that's x minus 2 times x minus 4 and so we have zeros at x equals 0, 2, and 4

08:13:57.900 --> 08:14:03.580
and so we should be able to graph this before we graph this let's go ahead and figure out what the

08:14:04.540 --> 08:14:12.380
slope is between the points between the edges i didn't even give a range let's do the range on

08:14:12.380 --> 08:14:25.020
negative one to six so let's find f of negative one and f of six and we'll have our calculator help

08:14:25.020 --> 08:14:41.260
with that just to make it a little quicker we have x cubed minus 6x squared plus 8x

08:14:43.100 --> 08:14:49.980
and i'll go to my table let's delete out the values we don't want at negative one it's equal to negative 15

08:14:50.300 --> 08:14:55.820
and at six it's equal to 48

08:14:58.460 --> 08:15:04.780
so we had negative 15 and 48 so this graph's not going to be really to scale

08:15:05.900 --> 08:15:12.860
but at negative one and then one two three four five six up here is going to be 48

08:15:13.660 --> 08:15:19.660
which means we've got about negative 15 down here somewhere

08:15:23.820 --> 08:15:25.980
we have a zero at zero

08:15:28.140 --> 08:15:33.660
two and four we know at six it's equal to 48

08:15:35.260 --> 08:15:41.340
and at negative one it's negative 15 so this graph's going to come in go up go down and up

08:15:43.180 --> 08:15:48.780
but what this problem really wants us to do is connect the end points with this line

08:15:51.980 --> 08:15:56.620
and then go ahead and just show graphically that we can draw a parallel line that's tangent

08:15:58.220 --> 08:16:03.740
to the graph at least at one point and you notice there's two points where those lines are parallel

08:16:03.740 --> 08:16:07.740
probably a little too steep there well too far the other direction

08:16:07.740 --> 08:16:14.300
uh tricky there we go

08:16:16.460 --> 08:16:22.780
parallel lines same slope tangent to the points on the graph between

08:16:23.660 --> 08:16:27.180
our a and our b between negative one and negative six

08:16:30.940 --> 08:16:35.340
but just doing it graphically is a little boring let's actually find the points

08:16:35.340 --> 08:16:39.020
let's find the points

08:16:42.220 --> 08:16:51.100
c where we get that average rate of change is equal to the instantaneous rate of change

08:16:51.100 --> 08:16:59.020
or f prime of c the derivative at c is f of b minus f of a over b minus a

08:16:59.820 --> 08:17:08.380
and let's go ahead and do the same function that we did up above we're going to do f of x

08:17:09.020 --> 08:17:17.260
equals x cubed minus six x squared plus eight x on the same range of negative one comma six

08:17:17.260 --> 08:17:23.100
and we're trying to find these black dots that we just found where are those points

08:17:23.740 --> 08:17:27.980
that we're going to get the same slope as the average slope

08:17:30.300 --> 08:17:38.140
well first let's find the average slope that's f of b minus f of a over b minus a

08:17:40.300 --> 08:17:49.820
or f of six using the endpoints minus f of negative one over six minus negative one

08:17:49.820 --> 08:17:54.860
and we just saw that f of six is equal to 48

08:17:57.340 --> 08:18:06.860
minus f of negative one is negative 15 over six minus negative one so we have 63

08:18:10.460 --> 08:18:17.500
over seven which is equal to a nice pretty nine

08:18:20.700 --> 08:18:24.860
so we want to know when the derivative is going to be equal to nine

08:18:26.940 --> 08:18:34.300
so we're going to find the derivative f of f prime of x which is three x squared

08:18:34.300 --> 08:18:40.940
minus 12x plus eight we want to know when that's equal to the average slope or equal to nine

08:18:40.940 --> 08:18:48.060
well we need to subtract nine from both sides to make it equal to zero three x squared minus

08:18:48.060 --> 08:18:56.380
12x minus one equals zero and you might see that that's not going to factor very nicely

08:18:58.780 --> 08:19:04.540
so let's see rx then using the quadratic formula is equal to 12

08:19:05.340 --> 08:19:11.900
plus or minus the square root of 12 squared minus four times three times negative one

08:19:12.620 --> 08:19:17.980
all over two times three and when I do that on my calculator

08:19:20.140 --> 08:19:24.060
I'll end up with two values first if we subtract you get negative

08:19:25.020 --> 08:19:32.460
point zero eight and four point zero eight

08:19:34.780 --> 08:19:42.140
so my graph's not really to scale but we would have hit those slopes at negative point zero eight

08:19:42.940 --> 08:19:51.340
and four point zero eight so I went through and made a graph that was more to scale than the one

08:19:51.340 --> 08:19:56.860
that we had before the red curve that you see here is our function that we've been working with

08:19:57.420 --> 08:20:05.260
and then what I did is I put a dot at negative one comma negative 15 and six comma 48 and you

08:20:05.260 --> 08:20:11.900
can see I've connected them with this orange line then what I did is I put a purple dot here at the

08:20:12.460 --> 08:20:20.060
first point that we had the negative point zero eight and drew a tangent line I also put a dot at

08:20:20.060 --> 08:20:26.300
the second point that we found at four point zero eight and drew a tangent line and you see that

08:20:26.300 --> 08:20:32.540
those blue tangent lines are perfectly parallel to the orange tangent line and what that means is

08:20:32.540 --> 08:20:39.020
that the instantaneous rate of change at those two points on those blue lines is equal to the

08:20:39.020 --> 08:20:45.580
average rate of change of the orange line that connects the two endpoints and that's visually

08:20:45.580 --> 08:20:53.900
how the mean value theorem works so our two answers do work the mean value theorem is

08:20:56.140 --> 08:20:59.740
right there on your screen the big thing we're talking about today

08:20:59.740 --> 08:21:05.340
is that if the function is continuous and differentiable between the two endpoints

08:21:05.340 --> 08:21:11.340
there exist at least one point C such that the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the

08:21:11.340 --> 08:21:16.940
average rate of change or the slope between the two points take a look at the assignment and try

08:21:16.940 --> 08:21:24.780
a few of these and we'll take a closer look at them in class the derivatives can tell us a whole

08:21:24.780 --> 08:21:29.980
bunch about the shape of a graph of a function and that's what we're going to look at today we're

08:21:29.980 --> 08:21:40.140
going to answer the question what do derivatives tell us

08:21:45.340 --> 08:21:50.940
about the shape of a graph

08:21:50.940 --> 08:22:04.220
first thing we're going to look at is what is called the first derivative test

08:22:09.660 --> 08:22:13.500
and to kind of set up what the first derivative test does i'm going to draw a little picture here

08:22:13.740 --> 08:22:20.780
actually three pictures three little graphs and we're going to compare what the derivative is

08:22:20.780 --> 08:22:31.820
doing on each so here is some function f kind of curving upwards we'll have some function f

08:22:31.820 --> 08:22:40.460
curving downwards and then we'll have a function f that comes up to a point and we're going to

08:22:40.460 --> 08:22:45.900
be interested particularly at a point c kind of in the middle of both of the are all three of these

08:22:46.700 --> 08:22:53.980
and what the derivative is doing at each one of those now we know the derivative is the slope of

08:22:53.980 --> 08:23:01.980
the tangent line at that point and so if i draw my point and the tangent line for the one that's

08:23:01.980 --> 08:23:09.180
go increasing for the one that's curving upwards you see the slope is also going upwards in other

08:23:09.180 --> 08:23:22.540
words if the function f of x is increasing the derivative f prime of x is positive

08:23:26.060 --> 08:23:33.180
and similarly at the point c on the curve that's decreasing or going down you'll see that the

08:23:33.180 --> 08:23:45.500
slope of the tangent line is going downhill it is negative so we'll say that when f of x is decreasing

08:23:48.780 --> 08:23:53.820
the derivative f prime of x is negative

08:23:53.820 --> 08:24:05.900
now at the peak here on the third graph you'll notice that it's neither increasing or decreasing

08:24:06.700 --> 08:24:10.220
and in fact the tangent line is completely flat

08:24:12.620 --> 08:24:22.540
at that point so if f of x is neither increasing nor decreasing then f prime of x

08:24:24.380 --> 08:24:32.700
is zero which is neither positive nor negative now we recognize that point

08:24:36.140 --> 08:24:43.100
as a point when the derivative is zero we call that a critical point we already know that critical

08:24:43.100 --> 08:24:51.660
points are where the derivative is zero it's either a maximum or a minimum value

08:24:54.460 --> 08:25:03.820
so let's summarize that conclusion in the actual test the first derivative test

08:25:05.740 --> 08:25:09.580
what we're going to do with the first derivative test to learn about the function

08:25:09.580 --> 08:25:14.140
is first we're going to find all critical points

08:25:14.300 --> 08:25:26.700
and as a reminder that's when f prime of x is equal to zero or it's undefined

08:25:32.780 --> 08:25:36.700
once we find those points we can use those points to divide

08:25:36.860 --> 08:25:43.900
f prime of x into subregions

08:25:49.740 --> 08:25:55.340
and then we can test each subregion

08:25:58.620 --> 08:26:03.500
and we'll find out where the derivative is zero that's going to be where the graph levels out

08:26:03.500 --> 08:26:08.220
and then we'll know in between those points is the graph increasing or decreasing

08:26:09.260 --> 08:26:16.540
based on what the derivative is doing so let's see if we can use that test with an example here

08:26:21.100 --> 08:26:23.980
the example we're going to play with is f of x

08:26:24.140 --> 08:26:33.820
equals x cubed minus 12x we're going to decide where is the derivative zero where is it increasing

08:26:33.820 --> 08:26:40.700
where is it decreasing well first we have to know the derivative f prime of x is equal to

08:26:40.700 --> 08:26:48.300
3x squared minus 12 and to find those critical points we set it equal to zero

08:26:48.540 --> 08:26:55.820
so if i add 12 to both sats actually let's just factor it uh let's do 3 times x squared minus

08:26:55.820 --> 08:27:04.380
four equals zero three times x plus two times x minus two equals zero so our critical points

08:27:04.380 --> 08:27:10.060
are x equals negative two and positive two those are our critical points

08:27:10.860 --> 08:27:16.540
then what we're going to do is we're going to divide

08:27:18.060 --> 08:27:25.580
kind of a number line into those subregions we've got negative two and positive two

08:27:26.140 --> 08:27:32.140
and we know at those points the derivative is zero the graph is flat at those points

08:27:32.700 --> 08:27:38.620
so what's f prime in those regions

08:27:41.660 --> 08:27:46.460
the easiest way to test that is we're going to go to our calculator on the calculator we're

08:27:46.460 --> 08:27:51.980
going to hit the y equals button and type in our derivative function so we know if the derivative

08:27:51.980 --> 08:28:00.860
is positive or negative the derivative function was 3x squared minus 12 and we'll go to our table

08:28:01.500 --> 08:28:08.540
second table let's delete out the old values now first we need to test a point in each of

08:28:08.540 --> 08:28:14.540
these three regions left of negative two between negative two and positive two and right of two

08:28:15.260 --> 08:28:18.780
so left of negative two we can pick any number let's pick negative five

08:28:20.220 --> 08:28:26.620
and we see it's a positive 63 so left of negative two the derivative is positive

08:28:27.500 --> 08:28:35.900
what that means is that f the function left of negative two is actually increasing

08:28:35.900 --> 08:28:37.980
because the derivative is positive

08:28:40.540 --> 08:28:47.100
between negative two and two let's put the number zero in it's negative 12 the derivative is negative

08:28:47.100 --> 08:28:54.220
between which means the function itself is decreasing between negative two and two

08:28:57.100 --> 08:29:03.420
greater than two maybe pick the number positive five it's positive all we care about is the sign

08:29:04.060 --> 08:29:08.860
and so that tells us that it is increasing over that range

08:29:13.740 --> 08:29:18.860
now we know where the graph is increasing decreasing and then increasing again it's

08:29:18.860 --> 08:29:26.860
giving us a general idea of the shape of the graph but there's more to the graph than just

08:29:26.860 --> 08:29:33.580
whether it's increasing or decreasing it helps to know what direction or how it is curving

08:29:33.580 --> 08:29:42.060
is it curving when it goes up on this left part is it curving up or is it curving

08:29:42.060 --> 08:29:53.500
up those are two very different curves in red there we need to know what type of curve

08:29:53.500 --> 08:30:00.620
it's doing as it's increasing and that leads us to our next topic the next thing the derivatives

08:30:00.620 --> 08:30:09.740
tell us about the graph and this is what we call concavity now concavity might be a new

08:30:09.740 --> 08:30:13.420
concept to us so let's set it up first with a little bit of vocabulary

08:30:17.100 --> 08:30:27.020
the first word we need to know is what is concave up concave up means it the graph itself

08:30:27.020 --> 08:30:31.820
appears to be rotating counterclockwise

08:30:40.220 --> 08:30:47.900
and if you think about a general parabola starting from the left you see it rotates counterclockwise

08:30:47.900 --> 08:30:53.580
as you draw the parabola you also could have something approaching an asymptote kind of giving

08:30:53.580 --> 08:30:59.340
a counterclockwise rotation or even if it was increasing a counterclockwise rotation

08:30:59.980 --> 08:31:04.300
going from left to right you're moving around the circle counterclockwise

08:31:06.300 --> 08:31:10.860
and that kind of makes sense counterclockwise if we think about our unit circle which we're

08:31:10.860 --> 08:31:17.980
very familiar with we count unit circles counterclockwise so that's a positive concave up

08:31:17.980 --> 08:31:20.220
motion going counterclockwise

08:31:25.420 --> 08:31:30.300
another way that i like to think about concave up is if i think about the parabola it looks like

08:31:30.300 --> 08:31:41.180
the u of concave up and that reminds me that u up is concave up as you might expect the next word

08:31:41.180 --> 08:31:50.460
is concave down and here we are rotating clockwise

08:31:54.140 --> 08:31:57.980
or if you think about the unit circle in the negative direction if you start from the left

08:31:58.540 --> 08:32:05.340
a negative parabola is concave down it's going clockwise around and you could also get things

08:32:05.340 --> 08:32:12.380
approaching asymptotes in much the similar way these all are concave down

08:32:16.140 --> 08:32:20.460
and as you might expect with calculus we're interested in when we switch between a concave

08:32:20.460 --> 08:32:26.780
up motion and a concave down motion just like when we switch from increasing and decreasing

08:32:26.780 --> 08:32:33.500
we have critical points with concavity when we switch between concave up and concave down

08:32:33.500 --> 08:32:36.940
what we end up with are called inflection points

08:32:42.380 --> 08:32:50.940
and that is where the concavity changes

08:32:55.660 --> 08:33:02.780
for example the graph could be first concave up and then it's going to switch to concave down

08:33:03.340 --> 08:33:09.500
right in the center there you see the rotation direction changes starts out going clockwise

08:33:10.460 --> 08:33:17.020
or counterclockwise then it changes to clockwise the classic x cubed also let's see this one

08:33:17.020 --> 08:33:24.380
starts out going counterclockwise and then turning it to clockwise you start concave up and then you

08:33:24.380 --> 08:33:31.420
change to concave down in the middle those are inflection points where the concavity changes

08:33:33.740 --> 08:33:39.580
and just like a critical point is when the derivative is equal to zero concavity can

08:33:39.580 --> 08:33:45.100
also be found the way we find those inflection points is we look at the second derivative

08:33:45.100 --> 08:33:49.420
f prime prime of x and see when it's zero or undefined

08:33:49.420 --> 08:34:02.540
now concavity tells us a whole lot when it's combined with the first derivative test and

08:34:02.540 --> 08:34:08.460
whether the graph is increasing or decreasing let's look at concavity

08:34:09.100 --> 08:34:13.660
and increasing

08:34:16.540 --> 08:34:17.980
decreasing relationships

08:34:21.900 --> 08:34:24.700
and to set this up we're going to do a little tic-tac-toe board here

08:34:30.860 --> 08:34:36.220
and we're going to look at what happens if the graph is increasing

08:34:38.620 --> 08:34:53.500
and it's concave up if it's increasing and concave up we have to rotate counterclockwise

08:34:55.260 --> 08:34:57.260
as we increase

08:34:59.980 --> 08:35:04.060
contrast that with increasing and concave down

08:35:04.620 --> 08:35:12.220
now as we are increasing we have to rotate clockwise which takes us off in the other direction

08:35:15.260 --> 08:35:18.540
similarly we can compare what happens when we are decreasing

08:35:21.340 --> 08:35:28.220
if we are decreasing and we're concave up as we go down we have to rotate counterclockwise

08:35:28.700 --> 08:35:39.900
versus if it's decreasing and concave down as we rotate it has to rotate downward clockwise

08:35:41.740 --> 08:35:47.820
so if we know both of these facts about the graph we will very quickly know the shape of the graph

08:35:47.820 --> 08:35:51.100
and what is going on at various points

08:35:51.740 --> 08:35:58.380
and we test for concavity

08:36:04.060 --> 08:36:10.620
very similar to how we test the first derivative test except instead of finding critical points

08:36:10.620 --> 08:36:13.980
first we find inflection points

08:36:14.940 --> 08:36:23.340
and once we find those inflection points we can divide

08:36:25.740 --> 08:36:30.700
the second derivative f prime prime of x into subregions

08:36:35.180 --> 08:36:39.900
and again we will test each subregion

08:36:44.220 --> 08:36:54.940
so let's take a look at just doing that test for concavity

08:36:54.940 --> 08:36:56.940
and then we'll bring it together here in just a minute

08:37:00.460 --> 08:37:05.660
so number four going back to that same example we had before

08:37:06.380 --> 08:37:12.140
where f of x is equal to x cubed minus 12x

08:37:13.660 --> 08:37:19.020
we already said the first derivative was 3x squared minus 12

08:37:20.780 --> 08:37:26.540
the second derivative then we can quickly calculate to be 6x

08:37:26.540 --> 08:37:32.060
and so we're going to divide the number line

08:37:33.740 --> 08:37:37.500
into subregions based on those inflection points

08:37:37.500 --> 08:37:40.940
based on when that second derivative equals zero

08:37:42.860 --> 08:37:47.340
we'll divide both sides by six and x equals zero is my inflection point

08:37:48.060 --> 08:38:00.060
and so rate at zero is where we are going to split up the f prime prime to see what's happening

08:38:00.700 --> 08:38:04.380
where is the second derivative positive and negative

08:38:05.660 --> 08:38:08.860
going to y equals now i'm going to clear out the second derivative

08:38:09.420 --> 08:38:13.180
or the first derivative we'll put in the second derivative equation which is just 6x

08:38:13.420 --> 08:38:17.900
and then go to the table to lead out what i don't need

08:38:18.780 --> 08:38:23.100
and i might have been able to do this in my head in fact i should be able to do this one in my

08:38:23.100 --> 08:38:27.180
head but just to show you for the more complex equations i'm going to test something to the

08:38:27.180 --> 08:38:33.340
left of zero maybe negative five and i see the second derivative is zero is negative

08:38:35.740 --> 08:38:39.740
then we'll test something to the right of zero maybe positive five

08:38:39.740 --> 08:38:42.700
and we'll see the second derivative is positive

08:38:45.580 --> 08:38:49.980
so we've divided into subregions we know where the second derivative is positive and negative

08:38:50.540 --> 08:38:56.140
now we know if our function the original function x cubed minus 12 is concave up or concave down

08:38:57.900 --> 08:39:01.260
we see on the left it's negative so it is concave

08:39:01.820 --> 08:39:10.700
down to begin with up until zero where it becomes concave up

08:39:15.580 --> 08:39:19.980
so we know on the left it's going to have some type of clockwise motion

08:39:19.980 --> 08:39:24.300
on the right it's going to have some type of counterclockwise motion kind of run out of space

08:39:31.980 --> 08:39:36.860
okay now that we know how these tests all work

08:39:40.620 --> 08:39:45.180
let's bring it all together

08:39:51.420 --> 08:39:55.100
with our function f of x equals x cubed minus 12x

08:39:56.060 --> 08:40:04.460
the first derivative which i'm going to always represent in blue here is 3x squared minus 12

08:40:06.300 --> 08:40:11.900
and we know if we make that equal to zero we found out earlier that gave us critical points

08:40:11.900 --> 08:40:20.380
at negative two and positive two the second derivative i'm going to represent now in green

08:40:21.340 --> 08:40:29.100
is going to be 6x which when we made that equal to zero that gave us inflection point at zero

08:40:33.180 --> 08:40:38.540
i strongly encourage you color code your critical points and your inflection points

08:40:38.540 --> 08:40:43.100
so you don't get them confused as you're breaking up into subregions here

08:40:43.900 --> 08:40:53.900
we know we've got critical points at negative two and two so these guys are going to split

08:40:53.900 --> 08:41:05.260
up my f prime my first derivative i've got an inflection point at zero so that's how i'm going

08:41:05.260 --> 08:41:12.140
to split up the second derivative of f prime prime and ultimately we're interested in what's

08:41:12.140 --> 08:41:17.180
happening to our function f in each of these regions there's not actually a lot of space to the

08:41:17.180 --> 08:41:24.540
left so i'm going to rewrite that give myself give myself a little more space f f prime and f prime

08:41:24.540 --> 08:41:34.460
prime okay first in green to the left of zero we found out the second derivative was negative

08:41:34.620 --> 08:41:43.820
so we know it's going to be concave down to the right of zero we found out that the second

08:41:43.820 --> 08:41:49.660
derivative was positive and so we know there that the graph is concave up

08:41:53.340 --> 08:41:58.940
in blue in the middle the first derivative to the left of two now we're looking at the blue lines

08:41:58.940 --> 08:42:04.540
ignoring the green lines to the left of two we found out the second derivative was positive

08:42:05.980 --> 08:42:14.060
which meant the graph is increasing between negative two and positive two we found out the

08:42:14.060 --> 08:42:21.020
second derivative was negative which means the graph is decreasing between those points

08:42:21.980 --> 08:42:31.180
to the right of two we found out that the second that the first derivative was positive and so we

08:42:31.180 --> 08:42:40.780
know the graph is increasing so now at the very top in red we should have an idea what the graph

08:42:40.780 --> 08:42:51.340
of f is doing left of negative two we see that we're concave down and increasing

08:42:53.340 --> 08:43:01.500
so concave down and increasing the graph is going to curve clockwise while increasing

08:43:02.140 --> 08:43:11.820
then between negative two and zero we see it's still concave down but it's decreasing

08:43:13.340 --> 08:43:19.020
decreasing in concave down is going to go clockwise and downward

08:43:21.900 --> 08:43:29.820
but after zero we're still decreasing but the graph is concave up which means it's going to

08:43:29.820 --> 08:43:34.940
rotate its curve to be concave up as it's decreasing

08:43:37.980 --> 08:43:47.740
to the right of two it is concave up and increasing so we're rotating counterclockwise

08:43:47.740 --> 08:43:56.700
as we increase now we have a lot better idea of what's happening with this graph

08:43:57.580 --> 08:44:01.100
let's see if we can actually make our graph

08:44:09.020 --> 08:44:13.580
and i'm not going to put anything on the y-axis yet because we don't quite have those

08:44:14.460 --> 08:44:19.100
what we do know about the graph is and i'm going to put a little dotted line

08:44:19.180 --> 08:44:27.180
it's not it's just to kind of mark right there now negative two is going to be some type of

08:44:27.180 --> 08:44:32.540
critical point so i should expect it to level off when it hits the blue line at two is another

08:44:32.540 --> 08:44:38.700
critical point so i should expect it to level off when it hits that blue line

08:44:40.540 --> 08:44:45.740
and then at zero is going to be my inflection point where the rotation changes

08:44:45.740 --> 08:44:51.980
okay we know our graph increases and rotates clockwise up to a critical point

08:44:54.220 --> 08:44:59.900
then it's going to decrease continuing to rotate clockwise until it hits an inflection

08:44:59.900 --> 08:45:04.860
point where the rotation should change but it should still be decreasing

08:45:06.300 --> 08:45:13.980
until it hits a critical point and then we keep rotating counterclockwise as we increase

08:45:16.540 --> 08:45:21.260
and i want to notice all the elements of our graph it starts out increasing

08:45:22.700 --> 08:45:26.620
then it's decreasing then it's increasing

08:45:28.860 --> 08:45:36.860
it starts out rotating clockwise until the inflection point when it rotates counterclockwise

08:45:37.980 --> 08:45:41.740
giving us the concave down on the left and concave up on the right

08:45:41.900 --> 08:45:51.500
and this is how the derivatives can help us get a very good idea of the shape of the function

08:45:53.100 --> 08:45:57.980
try a few of these on your own come back to class ready to discuss them and we will see you then

08:45:59.980 --> 08:46:04.140
now that we've taken a look at concavity and increasing and decreasing functions

08:46:04.140 --> 08:46:08.460
we've just got a little bit to add to our conversation as we look at how

08:46:11.980 --> 08:46:12.860
do we graph

08:46:17.420 --> 08:46:17.980
functions

08:46:21.580 --> 08:46:22.460
with calculus

08:46:28.540 --> 08:46:36.380
and the main missing piece we have right now is what happens with limits at infinity

08:46:41.980 --> 08:46:48.860
basically what happens is we take the limit as x goes to infinity of our function f of x

08:46:50.140 --> 08:46:56.860
or what happens as the limit as x goes to negative infinity of our function f of x

08:46:58.700 --> 08:47:01.820
and the big idea we look for here is we consider

08:47:05.820 --> 08:47:07.580
kind of a who takes over

08:47:11.740 --> 08:47:17.820
as x gets large

08:47:21.580 --> 08:47:32.220
so for example if i wanted to do the limit as x goes to infinity of 3x squared minus 7x

08:47:32.780 --> 08:47:41.420
plus 5 all over 5x cubed plus 2x squared minus 7

08:47:43.740 --> 08:47:48.140
who's going to take over in this case well in the numerator

08:47:49.420 --> 08:47:55.020
the 3x squared will take over because x squared is bigger than any x or any constant

08:47:55.020 --> 08:47:58.300
so when we square really big numbers it's going to become huge

08:47:59.100 --> 08:48:05.500
and in the denominator the x cubed is going to take over because it's got the highest exponent

08:48:05.500 --> 08:48:11.340
in fact what we could also say is that the x cubed is going to get bigger

08:48:14.780 --> 08:48:21.980
faster than the numerator what we're really saying is the numerator is going to be whatever

08:48:21.980 --> 08:48:30.460
it becomes but the denominator is going to become the biggest part of this function that 5x cubed

08:48:30.460 --> 08:48:36.220
is just going to become huge faster than any other part of this function well if we take any old

08:48:36.220 --> 08:48:42.940
number and divide it by just a huge number as x gets close to infinity dividing by a huge number

08:48:42.940 --> 08:48:48.860
is going to basically leave nothing left and you can see that this limit as x goes to infinity

08:48:48.860 --> 08:48:51.820
is basically going to equal zero

08:48:54.540 --> 08:48:59.100
similarly if i wanted to look at the limit as x goes to infinity

08:49:00.860 --> 08:49:10.700
of 3x cubed minus 5x plus 1 over 1x cubed plus 6x minus 2

08:49:12.540 --> 08:49:17.740
similarly we can see in the numerator the x cubed the 3x cubed begins to take over the

08:49:17.740 --> 08:49:23.740
numerator as it becomes huge and in the denominator the regular x cubed takes over

08:49:25.340 --> 08:49:30.060
but as we can see neither one of those is going to get bigger faster

08:49:31.980 --> 08:49:38.700
so essentially they are going to get bigger at the same rate because whatever we cube in

08:49:38.700 --> 08:49:46.140
the numerator we're also cubing in the denominator and essentially that part that's cubed will reduce

08:49:46.140 --> 08:49:56.540
or divide out the x cubes divide out leaving behind on the biggest part 3 over 1 or in this

08:49:56.540 --> 08:50:04.300
case just the number 3 because the x cubes ultimately as they become huge divide out

08:50:04.300 --> 08:50:09.500
and everything else is too small to worry about we're just left with 3

08:50:09.500 --> 08:50:15.180
compare that

08:50:17.580 --> 08:50:23.660
with the limit as x goes to let's do negative infinity this time

08:50:26.300 --> 08:50:37.340
of 6x minus 2 over the square root of 4x squared plus 3x i'm going to scroll up a bit

08:50:37.340 --> 08:50:38.540
so we can see better

08:50:44.300 --> 08:50:52.780
the numerator we can see the 6x takes over that's six times some huge negative number

08:50:52.780 --> 08:51:01.580
which means that 6x becomes a large negative in the numerator

08:51:02.540 --> 08:51:06.540
square in the denominator the 4x squared takes over

08:51:08.620 --> 08:51:14.060
but we're taking the square root of that and so that becomes the square root of 4x squared taking

08:51:14.060 --> 08:51:27.500
over but notice that reduces to 2x and because we square the negative that's x squared the negative

08:51:27.500 --> 08:51:34.380
squared becomes a positive so 2x is actually a large positive number

08:51:38.460 --> 08:51:44.700
and that again is because the x squared makes that part positive times a positive is positive

08:51:44.700 --> 08:51:51.340
and the square root is still positive so ultimately what we've ended up with

08:51:51.500 --> 08:52:00.780
is the x's 6x over 2x where the x's can essentially divide out

08:52:03.180 --> 08:52:10.540
but not the negative the negative is still there as x goes to negative infinity the

08:52:10.540 --> 08:52:17.740
numerator is going to go to negative 6 while the denominator goes to 2 giving us a final

08:52:18.700 --> 08:52:24.300
limit at infinity of negative 3

08:52:26.780 --> 08:52:32.620
and this is kind of the game we keep playing as we look at solving these limits at infinity

08:52:33.180 --> 08:52:40.300
we look at who's taking over what's happening 2x as it gets huge whether positive or negative

08:52:40.300 --> 08:52:47.420
and we have to be very careful with what's happening with the signs is it positive or negative

08:52:48.540 --> 08:52:57.500
so if i want the limit as x goes to infinity of x cubed minus 6x over x squared plus 5

08:53:00.140 --> 08:53:06.060
again in the numerator the x cubed is going to take over in the denominator the x squared is

08:53:06.060 --> 08:53:12.940
going to take over but what you see is they're not growing at the same rate this time the numerator

08:53:12.940 --> 08:53:22.460
grows faster because cubed is going to get huge faster than squared will get huge

08:53:23.500 --> 08:53:28.780
and so similar to our first example we're going to end up with a big number divided by something

08:53:28.780 --> 08:53:34.460
that's much smaller that's not growing at the same rate so if i take a huge number and divide it by

08:53:34.460 --> 08:53:41.340
something small i'm still going to be huge and so in this case this one's actually going to keep

08:53:41.340 --> 08:53:55.180
getting bigger up to infinity we need this concept of the limit as x goes to infinity

08:53:55.180 --> 08:54:00.620
to see what's happening with the in behavior or on the far left or the far right of the graph

08:54:01.580 --> 08:54:06.700
the first example we took a look at on the far edge of the graph to the right towards infinity

08:54:07.340 --> 08:54:14.220
this graph is approaching an asymptote at zero the second example at infinity is approaching an

08:54:14.220 --> 08:54:22.780
asymptote at three the third example at negative infinity is approaching an asymptote at negative

08:54:22.780 --> 08:54:29.420
three well the fourth example is not approaching an asymptote at all it's just going off to infinity

08:54:29.420 --> 08:54:37.420
forever getting bigger we're going to combine this concept of limits at infinity with all the other

08:54:37.420 --> 08:54:55.820
stuff we've seen about graphing a function so first our general strategy let's get everything

08:54:55.820 --> 08:55:03.660
down in one place that we know about how to graph a function first it's helpful to find the domain

08:55:05.580 --> 08:55:11.500
where is the graph or the function undefined do we have a hole do we have a vertical asymptote

08:55:11.500 --> 08:55:18.300
what's going on with the domain the second thing that we found back in pre-calculus days was we

08:55:18.300 --> 08:55:23.100
found the x and y intercepts

08:55:31.500 --> 08:55:40.220
then we're going to add what we talked about today which is finding the limit as x goes to

08:55:40.220 --> 08:55:49.660
infinity of f of x and the limit as x goes to negative infinity of f of x because that's going

08:55:49.660 --> 08:55:54.140
to tell us the end behavior or what's happening at the edge of the graph does it approach an

08:55:54.140 --> 08:56:03.340
asymptote or does it go off to infinity speaking of asymptotes we can also find any vertical asymptotes

08:56:10.700 --> 08:56:18.460
those are going to come from the domain not the holes the holes and the vertical asymptotes come

08:56:18.460 --> 08:56:23.820
from the domain but specifically the vertical asymptotes will want to label if there are any

08:56:26.220 --> 08:56:32.620
then using and i'm going to always do this one in blue using f prime of x

08:56:33.500 --> 08:56:40.220
identify the critical points

08:56:45.660 --> 08:56:48.460
and increasing

08:56:51.500 --> 08:56:55.260
decreasing regions

08:56:56.140 --> 08:57:04.300
that's what we talked about in our previous video from section 4.5 the first derivative test

08:57:05.500 --> 08:57:14.140
then using and i'll always do this in green f prime prime of x or the second derivative

08:57:14.140 --> 08:57:20.380
identify inflection points

08:57:26.460 --> 08:57:34.780
and concavity is it concave up or concave down and when we put all this together we

08:57:34.780 --> 08:57:40.060
should have a very good idea of what this graph looks like before ever touching the

08:57:40.060 --> 08:57:46.380
graph button on our calculator so let's see if we can work through one example

08:57:49.660 --> 08:57:56.300
and graph f of x equals x cubed minus 3x plus 2

08:57:59.820 --> 08:58:03.100
and i'll work through all the pieces we just talked about first the domain

08:58:03.420 --> 08:58:12.460
there's cubing adding subtracting multiplying here no restrictions on those the domain is

08:58:12.460 --> 08:58:19.580
all real numbers so nothing fancy there to find x intercepts

08:58:23.180 --> 08:58:28.460
we set the whole thing equal to zero i should do a different color here

08:58:29.180 --> 08:58:37.900
let's say zero equals x cubed minus 3x plus 2 and i'm going to use the rational root theorem

08:58:37.900 --> 08:58:44.060
and synthetic division to find these zeros the options are plus or minus one and plus or minus

08:58:44.060 --> 08:58:51.820
two so let's try first x equals one one zero negative three and two don't forget the zero for the x

08:58:51.820 --> 08:58:58.940
squared bring down the one bring down the one one times one is one negative two

08:58:59.740 --> 08:59:06.540
oops getting ahead of myself negative two and zero so that did work so x equals one

08:59:07.260 --> 08:59:16.940
is a zero and now i have one x squared plus one x minus two equals zero which is x plus two times

08:59:16.940 --> 08:59:24.780
x minus one bring down the other factor that we got of x plus one

08:59:29.100 --> 08:59:31.500
oops not x plus one we got to subtract one from both sides

08:59:34.940 --> 08:59:41.340
so that's x minus one and since we've got two matching guys we're going to say that

08:59:42.140 --> 08:59:52.380
x plus two times x minus one squared equals zero so x is equal to negative two and positive one

08:59:52.380 --> 09:00:02.300
those are the x intercepts for the y intercepts the y intercepts we only have to make the x is all

09:00:02.300 --> 09:00:09.660
equal to zero so we get zero cubed minus three times zero plus two which is two so y equals

09:00:09.660 --> 09:00:27.180
two is our y intercept part c is to look at the limit and i'm going to scroll up to give us a

09:00:27.180 --> 09:00:36.860
little more room as x goes to infinity of our function x cubed minus three x plus two

09:00:38.700 --> 09:00:43.980
and you see the x cube takes over so if we cube infinity what we end up with

09:00:45.820 --> 09:00:53.340
is just infinity but we also need to consider the other limit as x goes to negative infinity

09:00:53.340 --> 09:00:57.820
off the left of our graph of x cubed minus three x plus two

09:01:00.380 --> 09:01:04.460
again the x cube takes over because it gets bigger faster than anything else

09:01:04.460 --> 09:01:09.900
but this time we're cubing a negative large number when we cube a negative large number

09:01:09.900 --> 09:01:17.020
we'll get a negative larger number so this on the left side is going to go to negative infinity

09:01:17.740 --> 09:01:21.820
so we know from the left it's towards negative infinity and it's going to exit on the right

09:01:21.820 --> 09:01:34.460
towards positive infinity vertical asymptotes vertical asymptotes come from um

09:01:36.060 --> 09:01:37.900
let me write down vertical asymptotes

09:01:41.980 --> 09:01:47.100
vertical asymptotes come from when the denominator equals zero but we have no fraction here with

09:01:47.100 --> 09:01:53.180
this function so there are none with fractions you'll have to be careful of those

09:01:55.740 --> 09:02:01.420
e is our first derivative test finding the critical points and where it's increasing or decreasing

09:02:02.140 --> 09:02:13.740
so f of x again was x cubed minus three x plus two so our derivative is three x squared minus three

09:02:14.460 --> 09:02:23.740
and we find our critical points by making it equal to zero factor out of three x squared minus one

09:02:25.900 --> 09:02:34.060
x plus one x minus one so our critical points are negative one and positive one

09:02:34.300 --> 09:02:44.300
we're going to combine that with the information from part f which is the second derivative

09:02:47.980 --> 09:02:52.460
the first derivative we already have so taking the second derivative there is six x

09:02:54.780 --> 09:02:59.900
set that equal to zero and so x is equal to zero becomes an inflection point

09:03:04.060 --> 09:03:08.940
now for the sake of our graph it's going to be helpful to know uh well actually let's

09:03:09.820 --> 09:03:15.420
over here to the right first let's make our number line we're going to break it up with an inflection

09:03:15.420 --> 09:03:23.180
point at zero and a critical point at negative one and positive one

09:03:26.380 --> 09:03:33.020
so the critical point split it up into three regions the inflection point splits it into two regions

09:03:34.300 --> 09:03:43.580
so we can consider what's happening with f prime prime f prime and ultimately learn about f

09:03:45.660 --> 09:03:53.180
okay on my calculator here i'm going to hit y equals in y one i'm going to type in the original

09:03:53.180 --> 09:03:57.740
function because it's going to give me some key points that i'm going to want to actually know

09:03:57.740 --> 09:04:09.820
their exact coordinates so in y one my first the function is x cubed minus three x plus two

09:04:11.740 --> 09:04:17.260
my y two this is the first derivative three x squared minus three

09:04:19.820 --> 09:04:23.740
y three is my second derivative of six x

09:04:24.060 --> 09:04:30.380
and now i'm going to go second table and delete out this information i don't want

09:04:32.060 --> 09:04:37.260
first thing i'm going to do is figure out the exact coordinates of the critical points and

09:04:37.260 --> 09:04:45.020
the inflection points my critical points were at negative one and one and the inflection point is

09:04:45.020 --> 09:04:54.140
at zero what's nice is that gives me the coordinates of negative four one and one zero as my critical

09:04:54.140 --> 09:05:02.620
points so we have negative one comma four and one comma zero as my critical points

09:05:03.820 --> 09:05:07.900
we're going to need those in a minute and the other thing we pulled off the calculator was

09:05:07.900 --> 09:05:13.980
that the inflection point zero is at zero comma two we're going to need that inflection point

09:05:13.980 --> 09:05:22.540
here in just a minute now let's see if we can learn what's happening in each of the regions

09:05:23.980 --> 09:05:29.740
that we've mapped out here for our graph actually what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to y equals

09:05:30.700 --> 09:05:36.140
and i'm going to highlight the equals on y one because i don't care about f right now

09:05:36.140 --> 09:05:42.060
i just care about uh what's happening with the first derivative and the second derivative

09:05:42.060 --> 09:05:48.620
so if i highlight the equals and hit enter you'll see it's no longer highlighted now when i go to

09:05:48.620 --> 09:05:56.300
second table it's just going to tell me y two and y three so first for the second derivative

09:05:57.020 --> 09:06:02.060
that's in the third column there the second derivative we need something to the left of zero

09:06:02.780 --> 09:06:04.300
about negative five

09:06:07.260 --> 09:06:12.780
to the left of zero you see y three the second derivative is negative

09:06:15.580 --> 09:06:25.740
so my second derivative is negative it is concave down to begin with it's rotating clockwise to begin

09:06:25.740 --> 09:06:36.140
with to the right maybe at positive five you see the second derivative is y three it's positive

09:06:36.140 --> 09:06:42.060
so it's positive on the right which means it's concave up

09:06:46.620 --> 09:06:51.580
now let's go to the blue the first derivative we want to know if it's positive or negative

09:06:51.580 --> 09:06:59.180
so we know if it's increasing or decreasing y two has my first derivative in it so i'm looking at

09:06:59.180 --> 09:07:05.340
this column first we need something to the left of negative one we already have negative five

09:07:05.900 --> 09:07:14.380
and notice it's a positive number so it starts out positive which means it is increasing initially

09:07:14.380 --> 09:07:22.220
something between negative one and one would be zero notice the derivative is negative

09:07:23.340 --> 09:07:27.180
so it's negative which means it's decreasing until the next critical point

09:07:29.980 --> 09:07:34.460
something to the right of one we could use the number five that we already have which is positive

09:07:35.900 --> 09:07:38.380
so we know it's increasing after that point

09:07:39.340 --> 09:07:47.020
then we're going to put this all together to decide with increasing decreasing concave up and

09:07:47.020 --> 09:07:54.060
concave down what's the general shape in each of these four regions starting out concave down

09:07:54.620 --> 09:08:03.260
counterclockwise rotation but increasing we know our graph starts going up with a clockwise rotation

09:08:03.980 --> 09:08:11.740
still concave down after the critical point but now decreasing it's going to go down with that concave

09:08:12.300 --> 09:08:19.260
down motion from the bottom of that though after zero after that inflection point it needs to be

09:08:19.260 --> 09:08:25.660
concave up but still decreasing so you'll start to see the rotation go counterclockwise after zero

09:08:26.620 --> 09:08:35.260
but then start increasing after the critical point at one still concave up and so we can

09:08:35.260 --> 09:08:39.900
kind of see the shape the direction it's going to go kind of like an upside down parabola it's

09:08:39.900 --> 09:08:46.540
going to turn to an upside up parabola notice it exits at negative infinity on the left like we

09:08:46.540 --> 09:08:52.700
expect it goes off to positive infinity on the right like we'd expect we're going to put all

09:08:52.700 --> 09:08:57.580
this information together to make our final big graph

09:09:11.260 --> 09:09:14.780
all right first let's go through our list of things we discovered

09:09:15.740 --> 09:09:19.900
the domains all real numbers but we have x intercepts at negative two and one

09:09:20.620 --> 09:09:26.140
we did those in purple we had x intercepts at negative two and positive one

09:09:28.060 --> 09:09:35.580
we also have a y intercept at two so at two there's a y intercept

09:09:39.020 --> 09:09:45.100
we know on the left it's going off at negative infinity on the right it's going off at positive

09:09:45.100 --> 09:09:54.620
infinity we also know that there is a critical point and i'm going to do this in blue so i don't

09:09:54.620 --> 09:10:03.180
miss my colors critical points at negative one four and a critical point at one comma zero

09:10:04.540 --> 09:10:06.220
which is also one of our intercepts

09:10:06.460 --> 09:10:18.860
we also know there's an inflection point at zero comma two which is also one of our intercepts

09:10:18.860 --> 09:10:24.060
but that is an inflection point where it's going to switch rotation from positive

09:10:24.860 --> 09:10:29.340
oops start sorry it starts negative from a negative rotation to a positive rotation

09:10:30.300 --> 09:10:38.540
so we should see it comes in from the negative starts out increasing with a negative rotation

09:10:38.540 --> 09:10:44.940
hits the critical point and now it's decreasing but once it hits that inflection point the rotation

09:10:44.940 --> 09:10:54.060
is going to change direction hits the critical point and now it's increasing and now we've got

09:10:54.060 --> 09:11:03.260
our graph of our function notice just like we expected the first derivative told us it starts

09:11:03.260 --> 09:11:10.700
increasing then decreasing then increasing the second derivative says it's concave down or a

09:11:10.700 --> 09:11:17.100
negative rotation then concave up or a positive rotation switching at that inflection point

09:11:17.340 --> 09:11:27.740
and that is how we can graph our functions using calculus there's a lot of pieces so you do need

09:11:27.740 --> 09:11:33.100
to practice this so take a look at the book the assignment and we'll see you in class to discuss

09:11:33.100 --> 09:11:40.860
this further all this conversation around graphs the shapes of graphs when the derivative equals

09:11:40.860 --> 09:11:47.580
zero to find key points has a very important application and that is in what we call the

09:11:47.580 --> 09:11:55.100
applied optimization problems so our question that we're going to attempt to answer is how

09:11:57.580 --> 09:12:00.540
do we optimize

09:12:03.500 --> 09:12:07.180
or find the most efficient the fastest the biggest the smallest

09:12:07.900 --> 09:12:13.660
how do we optimize a value of interest

09:12:17.980 --> 09:12:27.260
and ultimately what we're really asking is when does the derivative equal zero because that's the

09:12:27.260 --> 09:12:32.780
peak or the valley that's the optimal point for the most efficient or most profit or at least

09:12:32.780 --> 09:12:39.500
expense or shortest distance or shortest time that we're trying to get after so let's take a look

09:12:39.500 --> 09:12:44.460
at a few of these classic optimization problems and then from there you should be able to solve

09:12:44.460 --> 09:12:50.300
lots of different types of optimization problems the first classic problem is what we call the

09:12:50.300 --> 09:13:01.820
rectangle problem where we're generally trying to either minimize the perimeter maximize the area

09:13:02.700 --> 09:13:05.980
something related to that effect so let's say a farmer

09:13:09.580 --> 09:13:14.780
has 80 feet of fencing

09:13:17.420 --> 09:13:22.060
to enclose a pasture

09:13:26.860 --> 09:13:30.060
along a rock wall

09:13:31.820 --> 09:13:38.700
what that means is he only has to actually fence three sides of the wall not all four sides of the

09:13:38.700 --> 09:13:42.060
wall so what dimensions

09:13:47.980 --> 09:13:54.380
would maximize the area

09:14:01.740 --> 09:14:05.980
so let's draw a picture to kind of see what's going on we've got this rock wall already

09:14:05.980 --> 09:14:08.940
and what this farmer is going to do is he's going to make a fence

09:14:10.780 --> 09:14:15.340
that goes alongside that rock wall so he's really only fencing three sides

09:14:15.340 --> 09:14:19.820
and we need to give variables to the sides as we calculate the area because that's what we want

09:14:19.820 --> 09:14:27.260
to maximize so we'll say it's an x by y fence which means the other side's also x if we're

09:14:27.260 --> 09:14:34.460
thinking about perimeter and we know that the area of any rectangle is equal to the length times the

09:14:34.460 --> 09:14:44.060
width or in this case x times the y but that gives us two variables so we need to constrain

09:14:44.060 --> 09:14:49.340
one of those variables so that we can switch reduce it down to one variable and that's going

09:14:49.340 --> 09:14:57.020
to come from the limit we're given is that we have 80 feet of fencing available to us well if

09:14:57.020 --> 09:15:05.580
there's 80 feet available to us that means the total distance x plus y plus x or 2x plus y

09:15:06.700 --> 09:15:09.980
that total distance has to equal the 80 feet of fencing

09:15:12.700 --> 09:15:16.940
well the easiest variable to solve for here would probably be y so we'll subtract 2x

09:15:17.740 --> 09:15:25.500
and we'll say that y is equal to 80 minus 2x and we'll replace the y in our area formula

09:15:27.020 --> 09:15:30.620
to be 80 minus the 2x

09:15:33.500 --> 09:15:40.300
to make life easier we'll go ahead and distribute so area is equal to 80x minus 2x squared

09:15:42.300 --> 09:15:48.060
and we want to maximize this area so if we think about maybe the graph of the area the area is

09:15:48.060 --> 09:15:53.900
going to increase to a certain point and then come down after that point we're looking to find that

09:15:53.900 --> 09:16:01.260
maximum point and we know at that point the slope of the derivative is equal to zero

09:16:03.020 --> 09:16:10.380
so let's find the derivative of the area in terms of x the derivative of the area is equal to 80

09:16:10.380 --> 09:16:18.220
minus 4x and we just need to make that equal to zero to find the critical point where this fence

09:16:18.220 --> 09:16:28.780
area is optimized add the 4x to both sides and 80 equals 4x divide both sides by 4 and x is equal to 20

09:16:32.540 --> 09:16:37.580
now that we know where that maximum occurs we plug that in for x and the y equals equation

09:16:37.580 --> 09:16:44.700
y equals 80 minus 2 times 20 or 80 minus 40 which is 40

09:16:46.620 --> 09:16:52.860
so for the farmer to maximize the area of his three-sided fence along the rock wall

09:16:53.420 --> 09:16:59.980
he should do a 20 foot by 40 foot fence

09:16:59.980 --> 09:17:09.020
and I think fence actually has a c in it

09:17:12.700 --> 09:17:17.980
20 foot by 40 foot fence and that's the idea of the rectangle problem

09:17:19.740 --> 09:17:24.540
let's try another problem this is probably one of the most classic problems of all calculus

09:17:24.540 --> 09:17:29.580
what I'm going to call the run and swim problem

09:17:37.180 --> 09:17:40.940
and rather than write this all out I'm just going to kind of draw a picture and narrate

09:17:40.940 --> 09:17:48.700
what I'm talking about we've got this river that's water does that look like a river

09:17:48.780 --> 09:17:54.300
we've got this river and a person is on one side of the river

09:17:56.940 --> 09:18:01.500
and he wants maybe a pot of gold that's on the other side of the river

09:18:05.340 --> 09:18:07.900
it is going to be nine miles down the river

09:18:09.420 --> 09:18:15.260
is where that pot of gold is but the river is also two miles wide

09:18:16.140 --> 09:18:23.420
what this person can do is he's going to run along the river aways

09:18:25.820 --> 09:18:30.860
then he's going to jump in the water and swim diagonally across aways

09:18:37.580 --> 09:18:41.820
what we want to know is how far should he run so we'll call the running x

09:18:42.300 --> 09:18:51.100
before he starts swimming in order to get to that pot of gold in the most efficient quickest way

09:18:51.100 --> 09:18:58.620
possible well we need to know a few things about this person let's say the person runs

09:19:01.020 --> 09:19:07.900
six miles per hour and swims three miles per hour

09:19:12.140 --> 09:19:21.980
so how far should the person run that's right at the question how far should the person

09:19:24.860 --> 09:19:31.900
run before swimming

09:19:32.620 --> 09:19:41.500
well let's see if we can get a little more information on this

09:19:44.300 --> 09:19:50.540
the swim distance let's call that swim distance y so we've got it labeled and then

09:19:51.980 --> 09:19:57.500
we're going to have this gap here on this right triangle we already know the height of the triangles

09:19:57.500 --> 09:20:03.980
two but that gap if the total distance from the person to the pot of gold is nine and he runs

09:20:03.980 --> 09:20:11.020
or she runs x it's going to be nine minus x is what's going to be left horizontally

09:20:16.540 --> 09:20:18.620
let's give ourselves a little bit more workspace

09:20:21.340 --> 09:20:25.500
well we should remember that the formula for distance is equal to rate

09:20:25.500 --> 09:20:31.420
times time and we're trying to minimize the time so let's go ahead and solve this for time

09:20:31.420 --> 09:20:35.820
and we'll say time is equal to the total distance divided by the rate

09:20:41.020 --> 09:20:43.980
and we know that the person is going to be running

09:20:46.700 --> 09:20:50.780
at a rate of six miles per hour so the run time

09:20:51.020 --> 09:20:58.860
is going to be the distance we don't know x divided by the rate or six miles per hour

09:21:01.580 --> 09:21:08.540
while the swim time is going to be the distance divided by the rate the swim time the y the

09:21:08.540 --> 09:21:16.220
diagonal we don't know or the swim distance the y the diagonal we don't know but we do know the

09:21:16.220 --> 09:21:24.620
rate at which the person swims is three miles per hour so the total time is equal to the

09:21:24.620 --> 09:21:32.860
sum of these things x over six plus y over three the other thing we're going to use to our advantage

09:21:32.860 --> 09:21:39.740
is we have a right triangle formed on the edge of the river

09:21:40.220 --> 09:21:51.580
Pythagorean theorem tells us that nine minus x squared plus the height which is two squared

09:21:54.220 --> 09:21:57.260
is equal to the swim distance which is y squared

09:22:00.780 --> 09:22:05.340
doing a little simplifying squaring the two gives us four but we want to get rid of the

09:22:05.340 --> 09:22:12.220
y squared so taking the square root of both sides we'll have nine minus x squared plus four

09:22:12.780 --> 09:22:20.780
under the square root is equal to y so let's replace the y in our time equation

09:22:22.540 --> 09:22:31.100
with that information time is equal to x over six plus the square root of nine minus x squared

09:22:31.100 --> 09:22:33.980
plus four over three

09:22:37.900 --> 09:22:44.860
this time is what we want to minimize in other words the graph here is going to come down

09:22:44.860 --> 09:22:52.460
to some point and we need to find out what point has a slope of zero on its tangent line

09:22:55.420 --> 09:23:00.380
and the way we do that is we take the derivative and set the derivative equal to zero

09:23:01.900 --> 09:23:06.060
square roots are a little bit more work to take the derivative of so let's actually rewrite this

09:23:06.060 --> 09:23:15.660
with a one half power so we have x over six plus the nine minus x squared plus four to the one

09:23:15.660 --> 09:23:23.020
half power over three because that's going to be easier to take a derivative of

09:23:23.900 --> 09:23:36.540
so the derivative of the time the derivative of x over six is just one over six plus

09:23:39.820 --> 09:23:45.420
let's make a big fraction and we'll do this piece by piece first the one-thirds a constant

09:23:45.420 --> 09:23:52.700
so that's going to be out front we can bring the exponent of one half out front as we take

09:23:52.700 --> 09:23:57.100
the derivative which means we've got a two in the denominator and a one in the numerator

09:23:59.820 --> 09:24:05.020
then we reduce the exponent by one which makes it to the negative one half power

09:24:06.060 --> 09:24:10.780
the negative one half power the negative exponent moves it down to the denominator

09:24:10.780 --> 09:24:18.300
so now we've got nine minus x squared plus four to the one half but in the denominator

09:24:18.300 --> 09:24:19.820
because of the negative exponent

09:24:23.020 --> 09:24:27.020
then we have to multiply by the derivative of the inside using our chain rule

09:24:28.220 --> 09:24:34.540
so we've got this little piece the nine minus x squared that we can take the derivative of

09:24:34.540 --> 09:24:39.020
brings the two out front times the nine minus x

09:24:41.580 --> 09:24:44.540
reduce the exponent by one just leaves nine minus x

09:24:45.340 --> 09:24:48.060
and then we have to multiply by the derivative of inside that

09:24:49.420 --> 09:24:52.620
and the derivative of negative x is negative one

09:24:56.780 --> 09:25:02.060
let's see if we can clean that up a little bit what I notice is we've got two's that divide out

09:25:02.060 --> 09:25:02.780
which is nice

09:25:06.300 --> 09:25:13.020
so oh let's take this negative and do a positive times a negative is a negative so we've got one

09:25:13.020 --> 09:25:19.980
sixth minus we're left with the nine minus x in the numerator

09:25:21.100 --> 09:25:29.260
let's do this in brown actually it's a better color we've got one sixth minus nine minus x is

09:25:29.260 --> 09:25:32.540
left in the numerator and that's it so I don't really need the parentheses

09:25:35.820 --> 09:25:41.100
over three and let's go ahead and take that one half and make it back into a square root

09:25:41.100 --> 09:25:46.380
times nine minus x squared plus four

09:25:49.500 --> 09:25:55.900
and we know when this derivative equals zero we've got our minimum time

09:25:58.780 --> 09:26:02.620
switch over to purple we're going to add that first fraction to the other that second

09:26:02.620 --> 09:26:11.820
fraction to the other side giving us one sixth equals nine minus x over three square roots

09:26:12.860 --> 09:26:15.180
of nine minus x squared plus four

09:26:19.580 --> 09:26:26.460
we now have two equal fractions we can solve two equal fractions by multiplying the diagonals

09:26:27.180 --> 09:26:37.740
one times three times the square root is three square roots of nine minus x squared plus four

09:26:39.980 --> 09:26:45.100
equals six times nine minus x

09:26:49.340 --> 09:26:55.900
so go back to blue here as we solve square root is going to be annoying so let's square both sides

09:26:55.900 --> 09:26:58.620
actually blues a bad color let's do green you get a little more contrast

09:27:00.620 --> 09:27:06.380
square both sides and we know when we square both sides because it's all multiplying we square the

09:27:06.380 --> 09:27:15.580
pieces three squared is nine squaring the square root gets rid of it so it's nine times nine minus

09:27:15.580 --> 09:27:25.180
x squared plus four equals six squared is 36 times nine minus x squared

09:27:31.500 --> 09:27:37.980
let's distribute the nine onto both parts here we'll give us nine times the nine minus x squared

09:27:37.980 --> 09:27:45.660
plus nine times four is 36 equals 36 times nine minus x squared

09:27:50.700 --> 09:27:55.820
and if we keep the nine minus x squareds as a group we see we've got 36 of them on the right

09:27:55.820 --> 09:28:01.980
and nine of them on the left to make life easier let's subtract nine of these nine minus x squareds

09:28:01.980 --> 09:28:13.100
from both sides that tells us that 36 equals 27 of these nine minus x squareds

09:28:17.100 --> 09:28:18.860
divide both sides by 27

09:28:23.660 --> 09:28:29.900
36 over 27 reduces to four thirds equals nine minus x squared

09:28:32.300 --> 09:28:41.500
get rid of the squared with the square root of both sides and we get two over the square root of

09:28:41.500 --> 09:28:53.340
three equals nine minus x and i'm going to add x to both sides and subtract oops it's

09:28:53.340 --> 09:29:00.620
plus or minus two root three sorry that's important if we add x to both sides and add and

09:29:00.620 --> 09:29:05.900
subtract the two root three from both sides we get an x is equal to nine plus or minus two

09:29:06.620 --> 09:29:09.260
divided by the square root of three

09:29:12.380 --> 09:29:15.980
pulling up our calculator to take a look at this we've got nine plus two

09:29:16.940 --> 09:29:24.700
divided by the square root of three is one answer but what you notice is that gives us 10.15

09:29:24.780 --> 09:29:34.620
going back to the original the whole distance was only nine if i go 10.15 i'm actually going past

09:29:35.900 --> 09:29:41.020
my pot of gold and having to go backwards that's not the best strategy to go about

09:29:41.980 --> 09:29:43.660
so we probably don't want that solution

09:29:46.380 --> 09:29:51.580
so let's try again and we're going to do nine minus two divided by the square root of three

09:29:52.140 --> 09:29:58.140
and we find out x the distance we should run is about 7.85

09:30:08.540 --> 09:30:14.860
so this person's a really good runner he's going to run 7.85 miles before the person

09:30:14.860 --> 09:30:19.740
jumps into the water and either she or he will swim the rest of the way

09:30:22.540 --> 09:30:29.740
so now we know she or he's going to run 7.85 miles jump in the water and swim the rest of the

09:30:29.740 --> 09:30:39.260
way to the pot of gold that'll be the quickest way to get to the pot of gold that's the run and swim

09:30:39.260 --> 09:30:52.700
problem another classic problem is what i like to call the hallway problem

09:30:58.620 --> 09:31:04.140
the hallway problem is best illustrated with a picture the idea is you've got a hallway that

09:31:04.140 --> 09:31:13.740
goes around a corner but the width of the hallway is not the same on both sides maybe on one side

09:31:13.740 --> 09:31:20.380
the hallway is 10 feet long and on the other side the hallway is 8 feet long

09:31:24.380 --> 09:31:29.900
and the question becomes how long of a piece of furniture maybe some long picture

09:31:30.300 --> 09:31:34.540
can you get around that corner

09:31:39.100 --> 09:31:42.140
in this hallway as you move into the apartment around the corner

09:31:43.420 --> 09:31:49.260
let's go ahead and write that out what is the longest

09:31:49.260 --> 09:31:55.660
piece of furniture

09:31:58.380 --> 09:32:03.660
to fit around the corner

09:32:12.220 --> 09:32:15.340
well to set this up we need a little bit more information on here

09:32:15.580 --> 09:32:23.740
one thing we're going to be interested in is what is the angle theta that we're going to be at

09:32:23.740 --> 09:32:35.100
in order to maximize our distance now we know from geometry if i extend the wall from the top

09:32:35.100 --> 09:32:43.420
side across this vertical angle across from it's going to have the exact same measurement

09:32:43.900 --> 09:32:49.020
so we get a triangle to the left and if i drop a line down we have a triangle to the right

09:32:49.820 --> 09:32:57.180
we actually have two similar triangles but one has a height of eight feet and the other one has a base

09:32:57.180 --> 09:33:01.020
of 10 feet

09:33:06.940 --> 09:33:11.260
also we're interested in the pieces of this furniture length

09:33:11.260 --> 09:33:18.300
so we're going to label the left side x and the top right side y and we know that the total length

09:33:18.860 --> 09:33:25.900
of my furniture is equal to x plus y but we don't like having two variables so we have to try and

09:33:25.900 --> 09:33:29.820
use our relationships to reduce it down to one variable

09:33:32.620 --> 09:33:36.540
and actually that one variable is going to be neither x or y it's going to be theta

09:33:36.540 --> 09:33:45.420
the angle that connects them both with the 10 foot triangle from the theta we have the adjacent side

09:33:46.140 --> 09:33:52.620
and the hypotenuse that we're working with that means we're going to use the cosine over there

09:33:52.620 --> 09:34:00.780
we know that the cosine of theta is 10 over x

09:34:01.500 --> 09:34:13.100
and with the other theta on the y we've got the opposite side and the hypotenuse

09:34:14.540 --> 09:34:20.620
that tells us that the sine of theta is equal to 8 over y

09:34:23.980 --> 09:34:28.700
solving both these equations for x and y we multiply by x and divide by the cosine

09:34:28.700 --> 09:34:35.900
x is equal to 10 over the cosine of theta and y is equal to 8 over the sine of theta

09:34:37.580 --> 09:34:42.300
but rather than dealing with the reciprocals of cosine and sine let's just use the reciprocal

09:34:42.300 --> 09:34:47.500
trig functions and we'll say that x is equal to 10 secant of theta

09:34:49.260 --> 09:34:53.420
and y is equal to 8 cosecant of theta

09:34:53.820 --> 09:35:03.580
now we can replace x and y with these pieces and we've been reduced down to one variable

09:35:06.540 --> 09:35:12.540
the length is equal to 10 secant theta

09:35:12.940 --> 09:35:23.980
plus the y which is 8 cosecant of theta

09:35:28.700 --> 09:35:33.820
now we've got our function we're just looking for the spot that maximizes our

09:35:36.860 --> 09:35:40.940
distance or our size of our furniture where the slope is equal to zero

09:35:41.500 --> 09:35:47.820
so we'll take the derivative l prime is equal to let's do this in a different color

09:35:47.820 --> 09:35:55.580
let's go to brown l prime is equal to 10 the derivative of secant is secant tangent

09:35:57.500 --> 09:36:07.100
secant theta tangent theta plus 8 the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant

09:36:07.100 --> 09:36:11.660
cotangent so instead of plus 8 let's say minus 8 cosecant

09:36:16.460 --> 09:36:17.500
cotangent theta

09:36:21.660 --> 09:36:26.620
and all we need to know is when this equation equals zero

09:36:33.260 --> 09:36:36.140
well let's start by moving the negative part over to the right side

09:36:36.140 --> 09:36:46.620
so we've got 10 secant theta tangent theta equals 8 cosecant theta cotangent theta

09:36:51.580 --> 09:36:56.540
and probably the easiest way to solve this would be to change this all into signs and cosines

09:36:56.540 --> 09:37:00.620
since we're more familiar with signs and cosines and seeing if we can establish

09:37:01.580 --> 09:37:03.580
um what's happening here

09:37:05.900 --> 09:37:11.980
so we'll make a fraction 10s in the numerator secant is 1 over cosine so it's 10 over we've

09:37:11.980 --> 09:37:20.940
got a cosine theta tangent is sine over cosine so we've got a sine theta over cosine cosine times

09:37:21.020 --> 09:37:32.460
cosine is cosine squared equals a fraction for the right side 8 cosecant is 1 over sine so that

09:37:32.460 --> 09:37:41.180
puts a sine theta in the denominator and cotangent is cosine over sine so cosine theta over sine

09:37:41.180 --> 09:37:46.860
theta we already have a sine theta so now it's sine theta or sine squared theta

09:37:53.820 --> 09:37:58.780
let's clear out the fractions by doing the cross multiply trick we've done before

09:37:59.900 --> 09:38:10.860
so we've got 10 sine times sine squared is sine cubed theta equals 8 cosine cubed theta

09:38:11.260 --> 09:38:24.540
let's move the numbers to one side and the variables to the other side we're more comfortable with

09:38:25.180 --> 09:38:30.460
tangent which is sine over cosine so let's move the cosines to the right we're gonna

09:38:30.460 --> 09:38:34.620
or to the left we're going to divide both sides by cosine cubed theta

09:38:35.020 --> 09:38:40.780
and we'll move the numbers to the right by dividing both sides by 10

09:38:44.460 --> 09:38:47.260
sine cubed over cosine cubed is tangent cubed

09:38:55.580 --> 09:38:59.420
the cosine cubes are gone 8 over 10 reduces to four fifths

09:38:59.420 --> 09:39:05.820
get rid of the cube with the cube root of both sides

09:39:08.700 --> 09:39:14.940
and then tangent of theta our angle is the cube root of four fifths

09:39:16.940 --> 09:39:26.380
so theta is equal to the tangent inverse of the cube root of four fifths

09:39:27.180 --> 09:39:32.460
or to make it easier on our well yeah let's just type that in our calculator

09:39:33.660 --> 09:39:36.700
let's find out what theta our angle is equal to

09:39:39.820 --> 09:39:45.740
we want to do the tangent inverse of the cubed root which is conveniently under math

09:39:46.300 --> 09:39:50.460
option number four is a cube root of four fifths

09:39:50.700 --> 09:40:00.540
and the tangent inverse of the cube root of four fifths is 0.7482

09:40:02.220 --> 09:40:05.100
0.7482

09:40:11.100 --> 09:40:16.620
but if you remember our picture our picture wasn't interested in the angle 0.7482 radians

09:40:16.620 --> 09:40:23.500
that's what we just found is that angle we're interested in how long is the x and how long

09:40:23.500 --> 09:40:32.620
is the y which means we have to come back to our x equals and our y equals equations in order to

09:40:32.620 --> 09:40:42.860
find those pieces so we have x is equal to 10 over the cosine of our angle which is 0.7482

09:40:46.700 --> 09:40:52.380
and y is equal to eight over the sine of our angle which is 0.7482

09:40:56.860 --> 09:41:01.340
fortunately our calculator can do that for us quite nicely so we've got 10

09:41:01.980 --> 09:41:06.140
divided by the cosine of 0.7482

09:41:08.540 --> 09:41:12.860
and so that x distance is going to be 13.64

09:41:16.940 --> 09:41:23.580
for our y distance eight divided by the sine of 0.7482

09:41:26.140 --> 09:41:29.820
that y distance is 11.76

09:41:35.740 --> 09:41:41.100
so for our final answer the total length of my furniture that can fit around the corner

09:41:41.980 --> 09:41:50.940
the 13.64 plus 11.76 is going to be 25.4

09:41:53.740 --> 09:42:03.500
feet i can fit anything that's 25.4 feet long around this corner it's any longer it won't fit

09:42:03.500 --> 09:42:09.260
i can't take it into my new apartment and that's how we solve the hallway problem

09:42:11.340 --> 09:42:14.700
so these applied optimization problems can come in many different forms but the

09:42:14.700 --> 09:42:19.820
philosophy is always the same find out some relationship between the variables take the

09:42:19.820 --> 09:42:25.580
derivative and set that derivative equal to zero and we can optimize either maximize or minimize

09:42:25.580 --> 09:42:32.540
depending on the context almost any situation take a look at a few and try a few and we will

09:42:32.540 --> 09:42:34.140
discuss it more in class

09:42:38.860 --> 09:42:45.660
another application of the derivative is something that can help us solve limits that before

09:42:45.660 --> 09:42:55.260
were unsolvable the question we're going to answer is how do we take a limit

09:42:55.820 --> 09:43:00.540
of an indeterminate

09:43:05.740 --> 09:43:06.060
form

09:43:11.900 --> 09:43:15.820
and the way we're going to do that is with what is called

09:43:16.380 --> 09:43:30.140
L'Hôpital's rule now L'Hôpital was a french mathematician who published this idea in a french

09:43:30.140 --> 09:43:35.020
calculus text however he's probably not the one who came up with it it was probably one of the

09:43:35.020 --> 09:43:40.620
Bernoulli mathematicians the Bernoulli's was a was a swiss family that were some of the most

09:43:41.500 --> 09:43:47.420
amazing mathematicians ever and they all were from the same family and there's some evidence

09:43:47.420 --> 09:43:51.420
that one of the Bernoulli's were the first to come up with it while L'Hôpital was the first

09:43:51.420 --> 09:43:56.860
to publish this rule or this trick to take the limit of an indeterminate form

09:43:57.900 --> 09:44:02.140
but first before we can get into what the rule is let's make sure we understand what the heck is

09:44:02.140 --> 09:44:13.980
an indeterminate form there's lots of indeterminate forms these are things that are technically

09:44:13.980 --> 09:44:22.060
undefined but we know that limits often exist at points that are undefined and one of these

09:44:22.700 --> 09:44:28.220
there's actually two really common ones that we're going to use is when the limit as x goes to some

09:44:28.220 --> 09:44:36.220
number we'll call it a it could also go to infinity of f of x over g of x where we've got some fraction

09:44:38.220 --> 09:44:43.180
but when we normally do a fraction with a limit we take the limit of the numerator and the limit of

09:44:43.180 --> 09:44:50.940
a denominator and simplify what that comes out to but when that reduces to zero divided by zero

09:44:50.940 --> 09:44:56.780
we say that is an indeterminate form we don't determine anything it doesn't necessarily mean

09:44:56.780 --> 09:45:03.980
it doesn't exist zero divided by zero is indeterminate so we need to do another strategy in order to solve

09:45:05.660 --> 09:45:12.300
the second indeterminate form really similar idea is the limit as x goes to a of f of x divided by g

09:45:12.300 --> 09:45:20.620
of x sometimes will equal infinity over infinity and it could be either positive or negative

09:45:20.620 --> 09:45:25.420
over a positive or negative infinity but this is also indeterminate because it turns out there

09:45:25.420 --> 09:45:30.380
are different sizes of infinity and we don't know if we're dividing by the same size or different

09:45:30.380 --> 09:45:38.620
size is it zero is it infinity is it one it could be lots of different things so if our limit is one

09:45:38.620 --> 09:45:47.500
of these indeterminate forms lopital suggests the way we solve that using his rule if our limit

09:45:51.340 --> 09:45:52.700
is an indeterminate form

09:45:56.140 --> 09:46:08.220
it can be shown that the limit as x goes to a of that fraction f of x over g of x

09:46:09.660 --> 09:46:18.780
is equal to the same limit as x goes to a but this time of f prime of x over g prime of x

09:46:19.500 --> 09:46:27.580
and often this second limit is much easier to take in other words if we if we do a division

09:46:27.580 --> 09:46:32.220
or a fraction with an indeterminate form we'll just take the derivative of the numerator

09:46:32.860 --> 09:46:41.580
and the derivative of the denominator and calculate that limit so let's do some examples

09:46:42.300 --> 09:46:44.780
where we do just that

09:46:50.540 --> 09:46:57.580
first example we're going to take the limit as x goes to zero of sine x over x

09:47:00.220 --> 09:47:07.340
now normally we plug zero into the numerator and the sine of zero is zero and we plug zero into

09:47:07.340 --> 09:47:12.460
the denominator and that becomes zero so we're really saying is zero over zero

09:47:14.060 --> 09:47:19.340
which is an indeterminate form so what we will do is we will take the limit

09:47:19.980 --> 09:47:26.300
as x goes to zero of the derivatives of the top and bottom the numerator and denominator

09:47:27.180 --> 09:47:34.060
the derivative of sine is cosine and the derivative of x is one so we're really saying

09:47:34.700 --> 09:47:41.260
let's plug zero into the cosine of x so we'd have the cosine of zero

09:47:42.620 --> 09:47:47.900
over the one is still one and the cosine at zero is one

09:47:50.220 --> 09:47:58.780
so this limit as x approaches zero is actually approaching one and that's Lopital's rule

09:47:58.860 --> 09:48:03.660
take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator and take the limit

09:48:06.940 --> 09:48:18.620
let's try another one let's do the limit as x goes to one of the sine of pi x over the natural log of x

09:48:22.620 --> 09:48:27.180
well if we plug one into both of these we get one times pi or the sine of pi

09:48:27.740 --> 09:48:32.940
in the sine of pi the y-coordinate there is zero and the natural log of one

09:48:33.740 --> 09:48:41.340
means e to the zero power is one so we've got zero over zero we have an indeterminate form

09:48:42.140 --> 09:48:47.260
because we have the indeterminate form we can take the derivative of the top and bottom and find that

09:48:47.260 --> 09:48:56.300
same limit the derivative of sine pi x is cosine pi x times the derivative of the inside which is pi

09:48:57.900 --> 09:49:04.060
over the derivative of the natural log of x is one over x

09:49:09.020 --> 09:49:15.020
well one over x that is dividing by a fraction it's the same as multiplying by the reciprocal

09:49:15.020 --> 09:49:22.700
so i'm going to simplify this one step further and flip that fraction over and we have x pi cosine

09:49:23.260 --> 09:49:36.620
pi x and now if we plug one in we get one times pi times the cosine of pi times one or one pi

09:49:38.140 --> 09:49:44.460
so we have one times pi cosine of pi the x-coordinate pi is negative one

09:49:45.020 --> 09:49:51.260
so we have one times pi times negative one which is negative pi

09:49:52.780 --> 09:49:55.660
our limit as x goes to one is negative pi

09:49:58.300 --> 09:50:02.060
this even works on problems with infinity that we've seen before let's say

09:50:02.620 --> 09:50:06.380
remember when we were doing limits at infinity the limit as x goes to infinity

09:50:07.340 --> 09:50:10.220
of three x squared plus two x minus one

09:50:12.860 --> 09:50:16.060
over five x squared minus x plus one

09:50:18.540 --> 09:50:21.900
and if you remember before when we were doing limits with infinity we said okay

09:50:22.700 --> 09:50:27.420
the x squared is going to take over and so the x squared part gets huge

09:50:27.420 --> 09:50:32.460
and then we end up dividing out the x squared and we're left with three-fifths

09:50:35.820 --> 09:50:42.140
but let's solve this using another method using L'Hopital's rule because as x goes to infinity

09:50:42.140 --> 09:50:47.900
the numerator becomes infinity squared times three plus two times infinity it's going to infinity

09:50:48.620 --> 09:50:53.340
same thing with the denominator it's going to infinity we have infinity over infinity

09:50:53.900 --> 09:50:59.420
which means we have an indeterminate form and we can take the derivatives of the numerator

09:50:59.420 --> 09:51:06.700
and denominator that gives us six x plus two over five x minus one

09:51:10.380 --> 09:51:12.140
nope ten x minus one sorry

09:51:12.300 --> 09:51:22.940
but now if we plug infinity in we have six times infinity which goes to infinity

09:51:24.860 --> 09:51:29.340
and then the denominator we've got 10 times infinity which goes to infinity

09:51:31.020 --> 09:51:33.660
which means we still have an indeterminate form

09:51:34.700 --> 09:51:38.700
but there's no reason we can't use L'Hopital's rule twice

09:51:39.580 --> 09:51:46.300
so again we'll take the derivative the limit as x goes to infinity the derivative of the numerator

09:51:46.860 --> 09:51:54.220
is six over the derivative of the denominator is ten and that's just a constant

09:51:55.020 --> 09:52:03.260
doesn't matter what x is approaching it's a constant six tenths which reduces two three fifths

09:52:04.140 --> 09:52:13.980
we can even use L'Hopital's rule with a one-sided limit let's say the limit as x goes to zero from

09:52:13.980 --> 09:52:19.900
the right of the natural log of x over the cotangent of x

09:52:23.820 --> 09:52:25.420
I might need a little bit more room here

09:52:25.740 --> 09:52:35.100
now as x goes to zero from the right the natural log goes to negative infinity

09:52:36.540 --> 09:52:44.220
and as cotangent goes to zero cotangent goes to zero remember cotangent is cosine over sine

09:52:45.020 --> 09:52:50.700
cosine over sine is actually going to be an asymptote that guy's going to infinity

09:52:50.700 --> 09:52:58.860
we have negative infinity over infinity we have another indeterminate form so we'll take the

09:52:58.860 --> 09:53:06.140
derivative of the numerator and the denominator the derivative of the natural log is one over x

09:53:08.300 --> 09:53:13.580
the derivative of cotangent is negative cosecant squared x

09:53:13.580 --> 09:53:18.620
and let's actually simplify that

09:53:21.900 --> 09:53:29.500
it's negative one over x sticks an x in the denominator and cosecant is the reciprocal

09:53:29.500 --> 09:53:32.540
of sine so let's put the sine squared in the numerator

09:53:35.340 --> 09:53:42.140
whoops I forgot the limit that's important the limit as x goes to zero from the right of sine

09:53:42.140 --> 09:53:47.580
squared x negative over x

09:53:51.660 --> 09:53:58.540
and now if we plug zero in the sine of zero is zero squared is zero

09:53:59.260 --> 09:54:04.700
and if we plug zero in the denominator now goes to zero so all we've done is we've gone from

09:54:04.700 --> 09:54:10.620
indeterminate form infinity over infinity to another indeterminate form zero over zero

09:54:10.700 --> 09:54:18.620
so Lopital says we do it again the limit as x goes to zero from the right of

09:54:20.140 --> 09:54:26.460
the derivative of negative sine well the negative stays there the derivative of sine squared is two

09:54:27.340 --> 09:54:33.260
sine x times the derivative of the inside which is cosine x

09:54:33.340 --> 09:54:38.300
over the derivative of x is one

09:54:42.940 --> 09:54:45.900
now we can plug zero in and we'll actually get a solution

09:54:47.020 --> 09:54:51.980
now we have negative two sine of zero cosine of zero

09:54:53.900 --> 09:54:58.620
which is negative two times the sine of zero is zero the cosine of zero is one

09:54:59.180 --> 09:55:04.460
and it simplifies down to a limit of zero

09:55:07.340 --> 09:55:11.340
so this is the big idea of Lopital's rule if we have infinity over infinity

09:55:11.340 --> 09:55:16.140
or zero over zero we'll take the derivative of both the numerator and denominator

09:55:17.020 --> 09:55:21.660
so that we can take the limit and plug it in we might have to do it several times

09:55:21.660 --> 09:55:24.700
but eventually we can get down to a limit

09:55:24.940 --> 09:55:32.700
those are the indeterminate forms that Lopital's rule allows us to work with

09:55:33.660 --> 09:55:38.940
but there are still other indeterminate forms

09:55:45.980 --> 09:55:52.860
that you could end up with the general strategy we're going to imply for these other indeterminate

09:55:52.860 --> 09:55:56.860
forms is that we need to make them

09:55:59.580 --> 09:56:06.380
either zero over zero or plus or minus infinity over plus or minus infinity

09:56:07.420 --> 09:56:11.020
we're going to massage them a little bit to try and make them

09:56:11.580 --> 09:56:14.380
in two an indeterminate form

09:56:16.780 --> 09:56:21.420
one classic indeterminate form is zero times infinity form

09:56:22.860 --> 09:56:30.380
what's nice is the reciprocal of zero is infinity

09:56:31.740 --> 09:56:37.340
so we're going to move that zero to the denominator and then we'll be in an indeterminate form

09:56:38.060 --> 09:56:43.420
or the reciprocal of infinity is zero so we could do the reciprocal and move it to the

09:56:43.420 --> 09:56:47.580
denominator because dividing by a reciprocal is the same as multiplying

09:56:48.540 --> 09:56:50.300
and we'll end up with a form we can work with

09:56:51.260 --> 09:56:57.580
here's what this looks like the limit as x goes to zero of x squared of the natural log of x

09:57:01.100 --> 09:57:03.980
now x squared that's going to zero

09:57:07.420 --> 09:57:14.380
but the natural log of zero natural log is approaching negative infinity so we've really

09:57:14.380 --> 09:57:16.460
got zero times negative infinity

09:57:18.780 --> 09:57:26.220
so we're going to rewrite this problem moving one piece down to the denominator as a reciprocal

09:57:28.860 --> 09:57:34.860
so let's move the x squared down here so we'll have the limit as x goes to zero

09:57:34.860 --> 09:57:40.860
of the natural log of x over x to the negative two or the reciprocal

09:57:41.740 --> 09:57:47.420
x to the negative two would move that exponent up so you can see these are equivalent expressions

09:57:48.220 --> 09:57:53.420
but now what we have is the natural log of x still approaching negative infinity

09:57:54.700 --> 09:58:01.100
and x to the negative two or one over x squared is approaching infinity

09:58:11.420 --> 09:58:16.380
and the reason that's going to zero is we have one divided by a teeny tiny number and we divide

09:58:16.380 --> 09:58:22.300
by a teeny tiny number we get a huge number as a result so now we have the correct indeterminate

09:58:22.300 --> 09:58:29.580
form we're ready to use Lopital's rule and we have the limit as x goes to zero of the derivative

09:58:30.620 --> 09:58:36.220
of the numerator which is one over x over the derivative of the denominator which is negative

09:58:36.220 --> 09:58:42.860
two x to the negative three cleaning that up a little bit

09:58:45.900 --> 09:58:51.500
the negative two is going to stay in the denominator so the limit as x goes to zero

09:58:52.700 --> 09:58:57.020
leave the negative two in the denominator but the x to the negative three moves up

09:58:58.140 --> 09:59:00.380
and the one over x means it needs to move down

09:59:01.100 --> 09:59:11.100
and actually that can clean up a little bit we have the limit as x goes to zero of x squared over negative two

09:59:14.460 --> 09:59:21.660
and now we're ready to plug zero in for the x when we plug zero in for the x we get zero

09:59:21.660 --> 09:59:28.940
square divided by negative two which is just zero

09:59:32.620 --> 09:59:38.620
so how we handle that zero times infinity form is we move one piece to the denominator

09:59:38.620 --> 09:59:45.740
using its reciprocal it's still equivalent that way and then we're in that indeterminate form

09:59:45.740 --> 09:59:48.060
that we can use Lopital's rule on

09:59:51.020 --> 09:59:55.500
another indeterminate form is when we have infinity minus infinity

09:59:59.340 --> 10:00:03.740
if we have infinity minus infinity we need to find a way to combine these

10:00:04.300 --> 10:00:12.460
to get a single fraction an example of this would be the limit as x goes to zero from the right

10:00:13.180 --> 10:00:25.180
of one over x squared minus one over sine of x if we were to plug zero in we would have one over

10:00:25.180 --> 10:00:32.060
zero which is infinity and the sine of zero is zero so we have one over zero which is infinity

10:00:32.780 --> 10:00:37.980
and so we end up with infinity minus infinity which is not necessarily zero because they might be

10:00:37.980 --> 10:00:46.060
different sizes of infinity so this is indeterminate form so we need to combine them into a single

10:00:46.060 --> 10:00:53.500
fraction so that we can try and use Lopital's rule if we do in fact have an indeterminate form

10:00:56.380 --> 10:01:00.380
common denominator would mean we multiply the first fraction by sine x over x

10:01:01.260 --> 10:01:07.260
and the second fraction by x squared over x squared and that's going to give us

10:01:08.060 --> 10:01:13.980
sine x minus x squared whoops forgot the limit part that's important the limit

10:01:15.660 --> 10:01:24.940
as x approaches zero from the right of sine x minus x squared over x squared times sine x

10:01:25.820 --> 10:01:33.900
now you'll see if we plug zero into the numerator the sine of zero is zero

10:01:34.540 --> 10:01:40.940
minus zero squared is zero and in the denominator we multiply zero times zero to get zero

10:01:41.740 --> 10:01:48.780
we have an indeterminate form which we can use so now we have the limit as x goes to zero from the

10:01:48.780 --> 10:02:06.620
right of the derivative of sine is cosine x minus 2x over 2x times sine x using our product rule

10:02:08.140 --> 10:02:16.860
plus x squared times negative cosine x so I'll make it oops sorry not negative cosine x

10:02:19.580 --> 10:02:25.100
derivative of the sine is positive cosine so we have x squared times cosine x

10:02:26.860 --> 10:02:30.860
now we have something that we can take the limit as x goes to zero on

10:02:32.140 --> 10:02:36.540
let's break this down piece by piece so we can really see what's happening when we plug zero into

10:02:36.540 --> 10:02:39.100
the cosine cosine of zero is one

10:02:41.820 --> 10:02:50.780
minus so let's just hit equals cosine of zero is one minus two times zero

10:02:53.580 --> 10:03:04.300
over two times zero sine of zero minus zero squared times the cosine of zero

10:03:04.700 --> 10:03:10.860
well we still are ending up with zero in the denominator or we're getting closer and closer to zero

10:03:11.660 --> 10:03:15.740
from the right because we end up with zero minus zero in the denominator

10:03:17.100 --> 10:03:21.580
but as we get closer and closer to zero from the right what that really means we're doing

10:03:23.340 --> 10:03:30.700
is we have left in the numerator is one one minus zero divided by something that is almost zero

10:03:30.700 --> 10:03:36.940
because we're getting closer to zero from the right one divided by almost zero or one divided by

10:03:38.060 --> 10:03:46.140
something really really small when we divide by tiny tiny tiny tiny things we end up with huge

10:03:46.140 --> 10:03:54.140
answers and so this limit as x goes to zero from the right is going to be a positive infinity

10:03:54.940 --> 10:04:00.700
let's try another one

10:04:04.620 --> 10:04:08.620
another indeterminate form is when we have infinity to the zero power

10:04:10.780 --> 10:04:15.340
it's not necessarily one might be one but not necessarily

10:04:17.580 --> 10:04:23.500
for these we're going to use a logarithmic substitution to help us out to solve these problems

10:04:24.940 --> 10:04:31.100
if we have the limit as x goes to infinity of x to the one over x

10:04:34.380 --> 10:04:40.860
you'll notice the exponent one over infinity is going to zero and the base infinity

10:04:41.900 --> 10:04:50.140
is going to infinity we have infinity to the zero power so we're going to rewrite it

10:04:51.100 --> 10:04:57.420
using logarithmic substitution we're going to let y equal the stuff we're taking the limit of

10:04:57.420 --> 10:05:04.060
one over the x natural log of both sides moves the exponent out front

10:05:08.380 --> 10:05:12.700
and we're going to take the limit of what we ended up with

10:05:13.180 --> 10:05:23.420
and know we can undo that natural log by taking e to whatever power we end up with as our limit or

10:05:23.420 --> 10:05:32.940
our solution so we're going to take the limit as x goes to infinity of and we're going to write it

10:05:32.940 --> 10:05:36.300
as a fraction natural log of x over x

10:05:39.980 --> 10:05:43.100
because we know that natural log as x goes to infinity

10:05:43.820 --> 10:05:51.500
also goes to infinity and so we now have infinity over infinity we can now use lopital's rule

10:05:52.220 --> 10:05:58.140
the limit as x goes to infinity of one over x over one

10:05:58.860 --> 10:06:06.780
which if we clean it up is the limit as x goes to infinity moving that x to the denominator of

10:06:06.780 --> 10:06:14.460
one over x which we know we're doing one divided by

10:06:17.020 --> 10:06:23.500
infinity or one divided by a huge number and when we divide by a huge number you're just left with

10:06:24.220 --> 10:06:28.780
zero but that is the limit

10:06:32.620 --> 10:06:39.180
of our natural log we have to undo the unnatural log by taking e to that power

10:06:40.540 --> 10:06:44.220
e to the natural log of y is y so e to the zero

10:06:46.620 --> 10:06:50.940
and i'll make a note here to undo the natural log

10:06:50.940 --> 10:06:57.500
that we did the opposite of taking a natural log is e to the exponent

10:07:00.940 --> 10:07:07.260
we take that a solution we had as our exponent and e to the zero is one

10:07:09.740 --> 10:07:17.180
so our limit as x goes to infinity of x to the one over x is equal to one

10:07:17.500 --> 10:07:22.700
let's try another one where we use that strategy again

10:07:23.660 --> 10:07:29.740
where we take the natural log of y in order to help us solve this one turns out to be in the

10:07:29.740 --> 10:07:36.220
zero to the zero form which is also indeterminate because a base of zero should have a zero for

10:07:36.220 --> 10:07:43.020
a solution but an exponent of zero should have one for a solution so what is what is the solution

10:07:43.260 --> 10:07:51.420
well it depends let's take the limit as x goes to zero from the right of x to the sine of x power

10:07:55.100 --> 10:07:59.980
again you'll notice if we plug zero into the sine of x the sine of zero is zero

10:08:00.860 --> 10:08:05.580
and then we have a base of zero so zero to the zero power is indeterminate

10:08:05.580 --> 10:08:17.740
so we let y equal x sine of x and then we take the natural log of y

10:08:18.780 --> 10:08:23.740
which moves the exponent out front so we have sine of x times the natural log of x

10:08:29.420 --> 10:08:34.700
now again we're going to get rid of that natural log by taking e to our exponent

10:08:35.820 --> 10:08:45.180
so we're going to actually calculate the limit as x goes to zero from the right of sine x

10:08:47.820 --> 10:08:49.260
times the natural log of x

10:08:52.140 --> 10:09:00.140
a problem is as sine goes to zero i'm sorry as x goes to zero sine goes to zero

10:09:00.940 --> 10:09:03.500
and as natural log goes to zero

10:09:06.140 --> 10:09:08.140
it goes to negative infinity

10:09:10.620 --> 10:09:16.540
we've got zero times negative infinity we've done this form before this was number one

10:09:16.540 --> 10:09:19.820
where we said we're going to move a reciprocal down into the denominator

10:09:20.780 --> 10:09:23.980
let's use that exact same strategy here

10:09:23.980 --> 10:09:30.140
we could move either one there is one that actually turns out to be easier and better

10:09:30.940 --> 10:09:35.100
i'm going to come down on the next line to give me some space let's move the sine of x into the

10:09:35.100 --> 10:09:41.580
denominator so the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the natural log of x

10:09:43.500 --> 10:09:48.540
over the sine one over the sine of x has to be the reciprocal when we move it down

10:09:49.500 --> 10:09:53.100
and actually what's nice is we know the reciprocal of the sine function

10:09:54.460 --> 10:10:01.260
is the cosecant so we're really doing the natural log of x over the cosecant of x

10:10:02.540 --> 10:10:07.980
which means now we've got the natural log going to as x goes to zero the natural log goes to

10:10:07.980 --> 10:10:15.100
negative infinity and for the cosecant as x goes to zero cosecant goes to positive infinity

10:10:15.100 --> 10:10:20.460
we have an indeterminate form that we can finally use lopital's rule on

10:10:22.300 --> 10:10:31.900
so now we have the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the derivatives one over x over

10:10:31.900 --> 10:10:35.740
the derivative of cosecant is negative cosecant cotangent

10:10:35.740 --> 10:10:50.620
and let's clean that up the limit as x goes to zero from the right the one over x moves the x down

10:10:52.460 --> 10:10:57.020
cosecant and cotangent are both very familiar reciprocal functions which will move them up

10:10:57.020 --> 10:11:04.460
which will be very nice cosecant is the reciprocal of sine so negative sine x

10:11:06.060 --> 10:11:10.060
and cotangent is the reciprocal of tangent

10:11:13.740 --> 10:11:21.180
so negative sine x over x tangent of x let's keep cleaning this up i want to break this up into

10:11:21.180 --> 10:11:30.300
two pieces let's break this up into the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the negative sine

10:11:30.300 --> 10:11:39.500
x over x times the tangent of x because what's interesting there is we know we can use our

10:11:41.420 --> 10:11:47.260
limit properties to break that up into the product the limit as x goes to zero from the right of

10:11:47.260 --> 10:11:57.180
negative sine x over x times the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the tangent of x

10:11:58.060 --> 10:12:04.860
and why would that be better well if you remember at the very start of our discussion

10:12:07.660 --> 10:12:14.780
we solved the limit as x goes to zero of sine x over x we know that's equal to one

10:12:17.020 --> 10:12:21.260
so coming down to our problem

10:12:21.340 --> 10:12:28.060
we have that same limit we just have a negative sign which can come out front

10:12:28.700 --> 10:12:35.420
so if sine x over x is one negative sine x over x is negative one

10:12:38.860 --> 10:12:44.940
times plugging zero into tangent x tangent to sine over cosine sine of zero at zero so we have

10:12:44.940 --> 10:12:52.220
zero over one which is zero which means negative one times zero we've got our limit at zero

10:12:54.780 --> 10:12:59.180
let's not get too excited because remember we did that natural log substitution

10:13:00.220 --> 10:13:03.980
so we have to undo that natural log substitution

10:13:04.540 --> 10:13:14.540
by just taking e raised to our solution our solution was zero e to the zero is one

10:13:15.740 --> 10:13:21.260
and so we ended up with one for our solution

10:13:24.380 --> 10:13:27.740
so that's lopital's rule lopital's rule says we can take the derivative

10:13:28.380 --> 10:13:33.340
of the numerator and denominator if we have an indeterminate form like zero over zero or

10:13:33.340 --> 10:13:38.700
infinity over infinity at the limit however if it's not in one of those indeterminate forms

10:13:38.700 --> 10:13:44.780
we're going to have to massage the problem a little bit to put it into a useful indeterminate form

10:13:45.740 --> 10:13:50.220
we might do that by moving a piece to the denominator we might do that by combining

10:13:50.220 --> 10:13:56.780
fractions into one or we might do that with logarithmic substitution take a look at these

10:13:56.860 --> 10:14:00.060
give them a good practice and we will discuss them more in class

10:14:02.300 --> 10:14:08.620
today we're going to address another question in applied calculus with derivatives and that is

10:14:08.620 --> 10:14:20.460
how do i find the solution actually it might be better this is a a solution because sometimes

10:14:20.460 --> 10:14:28.940
there's more than one to f of x equals zero

10:14:35.500 --> 10:14:40.940
this question is going to give rise to what we call newton's method

10:14:40.940 --> 10:14:50.540
and this is very similar actually to what your calculator is going to do to find solutions

10:14:50.540 --> 10:14:54.140
to various equations now we already know

10:14:57.420 --> 10:15:06.540
that if ax plus b equals zero all we have to do to solve for x is subtract b and divide by a and we

10:15:06.540 --> 10:15:17.820
get our solution we also know that if it's a quadratic ax squared plus bx plus c equals zero

10:15:18.700 --> 10:15:24.540
we also know we can solve for x using this simple quadratic equation of the opposite of b

10:15:25.100 --> 10:15:30.540
plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac all over 2a

10:15:30.860 --> 10:15:39.260
and we also actually have a similar formula for cubic functions the cubic's a lot more involved

10:15:39.260 --> 10:15:47.260
but one certainly does exist but outside of that we don't necessarily have a general solution method

10:15:47.260 --> 10:15:55.260
to solve for equations that become more complex and more complicated and so what we do is we

10:15:55.260 --> 10:16:02.940
use newton's method to kind of estimate the solution to any function to get an idea of what

10:16:02.940 --> 10:16:05.900
we're doing we're first going to look graphically at what's happening

10:16:11.900 --> 10:16:16.700
graphically what we are doing looks like this

10:16:17.500 --> 10:16:27.980
say there's some function here that comes down up and around

10:16:30.940 --> 10:16:35.500
and we want to know what is the zero what is the solution

10:16:37.500 --> 10:16:42.540
to that function and it's not a real pretty number so we're going to have to estimate it

10:16:43.260 --> 10:16:46.620
so what we will do then is we will guess as close as we can get

10:16:47.340 --> 10:16:50.540
and we will call that our first guess we'll use x sub zero

10:16:54.460 --> 10:17:00.860
and then we'll take that to the line and yes it's pretty close to our zero so to figure out what's

10:17:00.860 --> 10:17:05.740
happening around there is we will use the tangent line and the tangent line is going to give us our

10:17:05.820 --> 10:17:07.980
x one which is our next guess

10:17:11.820 --> 10:17:19.580
and if we go to the line that's closer so what we will do is we will find the tangent line

10:17:22.940 --> 10:17:30.620
which gets us even closer and we call that x two and then we go to the line and do another tangent

10:17:30.620 --> 10:17:38.860
line and you see those tangent lines are going to keep getting closer and closer to our actual

10:17:38.860 --> 10:17:46.140
zero until we can actually estimate its exact point so graphically what we're doing is we're

10:17:46.140 --> 10:17:59.100
making a guess at x one then we go to f of x one and find the tangent line

10:18:05.740 --> 10:18:07.660
and then this gives a better guess

10:18:08.060 --> 10:18:24.540
and then we will call it x two so we find f of x two and find the tangent line

10:18:27.500 --> 10:18:36.940
and you can see how we begin to repeat the process until we get close enough for our purposes

10:18:38.220 --> 10:18:45.580
so if that's graphically the process let's look at the equation

10:18:48.940 --> 10:18:50.300
of the tangent line

10:18:55.340 --> 10:19:00.700
at x sub zero or our starting guess

10:19:01.500 --> 10:19:14.380
well we know that y equals f of x naught the y coordinate plus the slope f prime

10:19:15.820 --> 10:19:23.660
at x naught times x minus the x naught is the equation of the tangent line

10:19:24.620 --> 10:19:30.780
but then we can find the point

10:19:34.380 --> 10:19:40.220
x one on this line that hits zero

10:19:42.860 --> 10:19:45.820
basically what we're saying is zero equals

10:19:46.060 --> 10:19:58.060
the f of x naught plus f prime of x naught times x one our new guess the new x coordinate

10:19:59.180 --> 10:20:08.460
minus x naught and then we will solve this equation for the x one

10:20:16.780 --> 10:20:21.900
as we solve the equation for the x one you'll see that we'll first subtract off the f of x naught

10:20:25.340 --> 10:20:28.220
then we'll divide out the f prime of x naught

10:20:30.620 --> 10:20:36.220
and then we'll add the x sub zero which leaves the x sub one

10:20:36.460 --> 10:20:43.020
all that to say this formula

10:20:45.100 --> 10:20:51.020
tells us how to find the next point or maybe we can say it more generally x sub n

10:20:51.980 --> 10:21:03.100
is equal to the previous guess x sub n minus one minus f of the point x sub n minus one

10:21:03.820 --> 10:21:07.660
divided by the derivative x sub n minus one

10:21:13.020 --> 10:21:19.100
this is going to be the important equation we're going to use to make it all work

10:21:27.820 --> 10:21:28.940
let's do an example

10:21:33.260 --> 10:21:38.700
and we're going to do all the ugly work on our calculator which is going to be really nice

10:21:41.180 --> 10:21:52.380
so our first example f of x is equal to x cubed minus five x plus two and we want to know when

10:21:52.380 --> 10:22:04.060
that equals zero to help us we'll do f prime of x the derivative which is three x squared minus five

10:22:06.140 --> 10:22:10.220
and to get an idea of the shape of the graph let's go ahead and hit y equals

10:22:10.220 --> 10:22:20.380
and i'm going to graph it we've got what x cubed minus five x plus two and when i graph it

10:22:20.380 --> 10:22:25.500
you'll see the graph comes up down and back up and we're going to be interested in seeing

10:22:25.500 --> 10:22:33.020
if we can figure out what is that value just to the right of the origin it looks like it's between

10:22:33.020 --> 10:22:38.380
zero and one just to the right there what is that value so just kind of sketch a graph

10:22:40.460 --> 10:22:48.700
the graph comes up down and up and we're trying to find this guy just to the right of the origin

10:22:48.700 --> 10:22:53.420
that is between zero and one

10:22:56.540 --> 10:23:01.420
i'm going to give you some calculator instructions that are going to save you a lot of work

10:23:02.940 --> 10:23:05.740
what you're going to start by doing is we're going to put

10:23:05.740 --> 10:23:10.060
f of x

10:23:13.020 --> 10:23:24.700
into y2 the second row and then we're going to put the derivative f prime of x into y3

10:23:24.700 --> 10:23:31.100
and then in y1

10:23:32.860 --> 10:23:37.980
we're going to put our formula which is the x minus

10:23:40.300 --> 10:23:48.700
the y2 equation at x divided by the y3 equation at x

10:23:48.700 --> 10:23:57.260
into y1 and you'll notice that is exactly the newton's formula that we just found

10:23:57.260 --> 10:24:03.980
where x is the n minus one y2 is the function y3 is the derivative of the function

10:24:03.980 --> 10:24:13.980
and the way we grab the function is we type in vars go over to y vars and then we go over to function

10:24:14.700 --> 10:24:25.020
so let's take a look at what that means y equals clear first i'm going to put f of x

10:24:25.020 --> 10:24:39.020
into y2 so y2 is x cubed minus five x plus two then i put the derivative into y3

10:24:39.900 --> 10:24:51.500
three x squared minus five enter and then i'll go up to y1 and for y1 we'll type in x

10:24:52.700 --> 10:24:59.180
minus we need to grab the y2 equation right next to the arrows is the vars button

10:25:00.700 --> 10:25:08.620
scroll over to y vars and select function and we want the y2 function which is the second one

10:25:09.580 --> 10:25:15.580
and then we'll open up a parentheses and say we want to plug the x value into the y2

10:25:17.180 --> 10:25:23.740
and we're going to divide by the y3 function at x so vars over to y vars

10:25:24.700 --> 10:25:30.300
function y3 is the third option and we want to plug x into there

10:25:30.700 --> 10:25:39.340
now when i hit second table let's delete out the points i don't want

10:25:40.940 --> 10:25:49.900
in x i can put my first guess for the zero we said our zero was between our solution was

10:25:49.900 --> 10:25:57.660
between zero and one so let's just guess maybe one for our first guess when we put one in for

10:25:57.660 --> 10:26:04.860
our first guess newton's method says the tangent line is going to take us over to zero so that zero

10:26:04.860 --> 10:26:10.940
becomes my next guess put zero in for the next guess and newton's method says the tangent line

10:26:10.940 --> 10:26:17.260
pulls us over to point four that's a little closer so we'll type in point four for our next guess

10:26:17.260 --> 10:26:26.700
now we've got point four one four one six for our next guess and that gets us a little closer

10:26:27.420 --> 10:26:31.420
so i'll type in point four one four two one

10:26:33.740 --> 10:26:37.580
and you notice when i type that and i get the exact same thing for my solution

10:26:37.580 --> 10:26:45.580
that tells me i'm as close as i can get for my guess

10:26:48.060 --> 10:26:51.980
so i'm going to come back to my whiteboard here and i'm going to summarize those results from

10:26:51.980 --> 10:27:00.220
the calculator just to summarize we started with x1 or x0 our first guess was at one

10:27:00.460 --> 10:27:04.220
that gave us our next guess which was at zero

10:27:06.380 --> 10:27:09.260
our next guess the calculator gave us was point four

10:27:11.020 --> 10:27:15.100
our next guess the calculator gave us was point four one four one six

10:27:18.060 --> 10:27:23.260
our next guess the calculator gave us which was point four one four two one

10:27:23.260 --> 10:27:36.520
one, and then when we plug that in, we again got 0.41421, and when we get the same thing

10:27:36.520 --> 10:27:41.800
on it, then we say that our solution is exactly that.

10:27:41.800 --> 10:28:03.000
x equals 0.4141421 is the solution that exists between zero and one.

10:28:03.000 --> 10:28:08.560
L'Hopital's rule is really nice though because it even works with non-polynomial functions,

10:28:08.560 --> 10:28:14.400
and transcendental functions that are a lot harder to work with.

10:28:14.400 --> 10:28:21.960
So let's try the second example here, where we say the secant of x minus x squared, we

10:28:21.960 --> 10:28:27.120
want to know when that equals five.

10:28:27.120 --> 10:28:34.080
Well, Newton's method tells us when things are equal to zero.

10:28:34.080 --> 10:28:36.120
So what can we do about the five?

10:28:36.120 --> 10:28:37.120
Exactly.

10:28:37.760 --> 10:28:41.560
We're going to subtract five from both sides to get the actual function we're going to

10:28:41.560 --> 10:28:43.520
use Newton's method with.

10:28:43.520 --> 10:28:51.760
So we have the secant of x minus x squared minus five equals zero, and we also need the

10:28:51.760 --> 10:29:02.880
derivative, which is secant x tangent x minus 2x, and the derivative of the negative five

10:29:02.880 --> 10:29:07.080
is zero.

10:29:07.080 --> 10:29:11.520
So we're ready to go to our calculator.

10:29:11.520 --> 10:29:18.000
First let's clear out all the old functions.

10:29:18.000 --> 10:29:21.400
Probably could have kept y1, but it's good to practice typing it in over and over again

10:29:21.400 --> 10:29:23.960
so you know that formula.

10:29:23.960 --> 10:29:28.520
But just to get an idea of where it's going, in y2 we're going to type in the function,

10:29:28.520 --> 10:29:31.520
the original function, which is secant x.

10:29:31.520 --> 10:29:39.040
Now the calculator can't do secant x, but it can do one divided by the cosine of x, because

10:29:39.040 --> 10:29:49.600
secant is the reciprocal of cosine, minus x squared minus five.

10:29:49.600 --> 10:29:59.040
And when I graph this, we end up with this fancy graph, and it's going to curve across

10:29:59.040 --> 10:30:03.000
the top to come down, and curve across the top to come down.

10:30:03.000 --> 10:30:08.200
But let's see if we can find the zero just to the right of the axis again.

10:30:08.200 --> 10:30:11.440
It looks like it's between one and two.

10:30:11.440 --> 10:30:15.280
So kind of our rough sketch so that we know what we're working with.

10:30:15.280 --> 10:30:22.520
It came down, wiggled up, and went up, and then it came back down somehow.

10:30:22.520 --> 10:30:38.080
We're going to be specifically interested in the first one that is between one and two.

10:30:38.080 --> 10:30:43.680
So in our y equals, y2 is the derivative.

10:30:43.680 --> 10:30:56.640
The derivative is secant x, which is one over the cosine of x, times the tangent of x, minus

10:30:56.640 --> 10:31:01.880
2x.

10:31:01.880 --> 10:31:09.960
Then again in y1 we're going to type in x minus the second function, yvars function

10:31:09.960 --> 10:31:18.800
2, at our x point, divided by our derivative function, which is in the third function,

10:31:18.800 --> 10:31:25.880
vars, yvars function 3.

10:31:25.880 --> 10:31:32.840
Second table, delete out all this other stuff.

10:31:32.840 --> 10:31:38.160
And we said our first guess was between one and two, so I might try one.

10:31:39.120 --> 10:31:43.240
You see one shoots us way out to 5.7.

10:31:43.240 --> 10:31:45.000
That doesn't feel like it's getting closer.

10:31:45.000 --> 10:31:51.960
In fact if I do 5.7018, that's going to shoot me back to 2.7.

10:31:51.960 --> 10:31:59.160
So 2.7228 shoots me down to a negative number, so I'm actually on the other side.

10:31:59.160 --> 10:32:10.080
And if I do negative 0.0015, now we're at 26,000, boy one's not getting me closer.

10:32:10.080 --> 10:32:15.560
What that means is either I'm not close enough to my point, or the slope at my guess is too

10:32:15.560 --> 10:32:20.480
steep that it's throwing me way out of whack and I'm not getting anywhere.

10:32:20.480 --> 10:32:25.120
So we said it's between one and two, let's try two.

10:32:25.120 --> 10:32:29.880
Two shoots me all the way up to 11, and you can already see kind of the same thing beginning

10:32:29.880 --> 10:32:31.120
to happen.

10:32:31.120 --> 10:32:42.640
We type in the next point, which shoots me over to 9.7, 9.7617 shoots me over to 4.6673,

10:32:42.640 --> 10:33:02.520
shoots me to 4.5696, shoots me over to 4.0024, now I'm back at 1.69, I'm all over the map.

10:33:02.520 --> 10:33:06.040
So let's try a better strategy.

10:33:06.040 --> 10:33:13.960
I'm not close enough to the point I want, but we know the point is between one and two.

10:33:13.960 --> 10:33:21.680
So let's try right in the middle of one and two, 1.5, ah look at that, it keeps me close

10:33:21.680 --> 10:33:26.600
to 1.5, we're at 1.46, I feel better for that.

10:33:26.600 --> 10:33:36.240
So let's try 1.4649, and that gives me 1.43.

10:33:36.240 --> 10:33:51.520
Notice we're staying very close, that's what we want, 1.429, 1.4283, and notice that tangent

10:33:51.520 --> 10:33:53.640
line is going to be exactly the same.

10:33:53.640 --> 10:33:58.960
We finally got close enough that we found our zero.

10:33:58.960 --> 10:34:03.800
I do want to make sure I'm showing my work, so I'm going to list out my guesses.

10:34:03.800 --> 10:34:16.400
My first guess we started at 1.5, my next guess shot us down to 1.4649, my x2 gave me

10:34:16.400 --> 10:34:39.080
1.438, x3 gave me 1.429, x4 gave me 1.4283, and x5 gave me 1.4283 again, which was the

10:34:39.080 --> 10:34:40.760
same.

10:34:40.760 --> 10:34:54.560
So my solution that's between 1 and 2 is actually at 1.4283, and that is how we do Newton's

10:34:54.560 --> 10:34:56.680
method.

10:34:56.680 --> 10:35:02.520
Newton's method just is taking us graphically from a guess to getting closer with the tangent

10:35:02.520 --> 10:35:06.480
line, then we use the tangent line to get closer, and the tangent line to get closer

10:35:06.480 --> 10:35:13.240
until we finally find the zero that we're looking for.

10:35:13.240 --> 10:35:16.840
Worry you have the advantage of using a calculator to make that process easier, but go ahead and

10:35:16.840 --> 10:35:21.400
practice a few, make sure you're comfortable with it, and we'll take a look at it in class,

10:35:21.400 --> 10:35:25.080
and we will see you then.

10:35:25.080 --> 10:35:31.360
One last thing that I want to do before we wrap up derivatives, and begins to take a preview

10:35:31.360 --> 10:35:36.720
of what is coming in our second quarter of calculus, is looking at what is called the

10:35:36.720 --> 10:35:58.520
anti-derivative, or really how we answer the question, how do we find derivatives in reverse?

10:35:58.520 --> 10:36:11.040
And that derivative in reverse is what we call the anti-derivative.

10:36:11.040 --> 10:36:32.040
And we say that the anti-derivative of f of x, lower case f of x, is the function f of

10:36:32.040 --> 10:36:49.360
x, but notice it's capital f of x, whose derivative is the lower case f of x. In other words,

10:36:49.360 --> 10:36:59.280
if capital f of x, the derivative of that is lower case f of x, then the capital f of

10:36:59.280 --> 10:37:08.000
x is the anti-derivative of the f of x. Maybe it's better with an example. How about we

10:37:08.000 --> 10:37:36.480
consider f of x equals 3x squared. Now, based on our power rule, which we know, but we're

10:37:36.480 --> 10:37:54.240
going to do it in reverse, we can conclude that capital f of x, the anti-derivative, must

10:37:54.240 --> 10:38:02.000
be equal to x cubed, because notice the derivative of x cubed is 3x squared. So the anti-derivative

10:38:02.000 --> 10:38:11.000
of 3x squared is x cubed. It's the process in reverse. However, there's something we

10:38:11.000 --> 10:38:28.000
need to note. What if capital f of x equaled not just x cubed, but x cubed minus 1? Or

10:38:28.000 --> 10:38:42.120
if capital f of x equaled maybe x cubed plus 7? If we took the derivative of both of these,

10:38:42.120 --> 10:38:47.040
the derivative of the x cubed is the 3x squared we want, and the derivative of the negative

10:38:47.040 --> 10:38:53.800
one is 0. Similarly, with the other equation, with the plus 7, the derivative of x cubed

10:38:53.800 --> 10:39:01.160
is 3x squared, and the derivative of the 7 goes to 0. So we actually ended up with three

10:39:01.160 --> 10:39:09.800
potential anti-derivatives of 3x squared. We've got just x cubed, x cubed minus 1, or x cubed

10:39:09.800 --> 10:39:14.680
plus 7. And actually, you can see that we could extend that concept to basically say

10:39:14.680 --> 10:39:23.920
we could add any constant number to the x cubed, and we would still have an anti-derivative.

10:39:23.920 --> 10:39:46.840
Let's note that. We can add any constant, and we'll call that constant c, to any anti-derivative.

10:39:46.840 --> 10:39:52.080
That means we're going to have to note that in our final solution. So when we say the

10:39:52.080 --> 10:40:07.320
anti-derivative, actually let's write this down. Different color. So the anti-derivative

10:40:07.320 --> 10:40:21.460
of 3x squared is x cubed plus any constant. So let's see if we can kind of use what we

10:40:21.460 --> 10:40:35.980
know about derivatives and apply those rules in reverse. Let's see if we can do a few examples.

10:40:35.980 --> 10:40:48.580
Let's say f of x equals 5x to the fourth. Capital f of x, the anti-derivative then.

10:40:48.580 --> 10:40:55.200
We know that with the power rule, the exponent moves out front and reduces by 1. So we can

10:40:55.200 --> 10:41:02.660
see the power of 5 moved out front and then it shrunk 1 from 5 down to 4. So capital f

10:41:02.660 --> 10:41:12.820
of x, the anti-derivative, must be x to the fifth plus any constant. Let's try another

10:41:12.820 --> 10:41:26.240
one. Let's say f of x is equal to 1 over x. Well we recognize 1 over x as the derivative

10:41:26.240 --> 10:41:34.260
of one of our special functions. 1 over x is the derivative of the natural log of x.

10:41:34.260 --> 10:41:44.120
So the anti-derivative must be the natural log of x plus any constant. What about trig?

10:41:44.120 --> 10:41:55.920
Let's do f of x equals sine of x. What is the anti-derivative? We're really asking whose

10:41:55.920 --> 10:42:01.680
derivative is the sine of x? Well we know the sine of x is the derivative of cosine

10:42:01.680 --> 10:42:07.260
of x, but there's that extra negative. The derivative of cosine is negative sine, so

10:42:07.260 --> 10:42:14.260
we might assume the derivative of negative cosine then must be the positive sine. And

10:42:14.260 --> 10:42:27.860
of course it's going to be plus any constant. What about f of x equals e to the x? Well

10:42:27.880 --> 10:42:33.460
this is our favorite function because the derivative is itself and so likewise the anti-derivative

10:42:33.460 --> 10:42:44.740
will be itself plus any constant. So we've been kind of playing with this idea of an

10:42:44.740 --> 10:42:50.820
anti-derivative of just kind of thinking the derivative of what should equal this, what

10:42:50.820 --> 10:42:55.960
do we know about derivatives, what patterns can we notice to kind of come up with the

10:42:55.960 --> 10:43:16.240
solution. But let's formalize what we're doing here with the formal notation for these anti-derivatives.

10:43:16.240 --> 10:43:22.120
The formal notation is we'll use this little squiggly sign. That squiggly sign we call

10:43:22.120 --> 10:43:33.760
the integral. The integral of f of x, and then we'll put a dx so we know the variable

10:43:33.760 --> 10:43:39.320
we're taking the integral of with respect to x. The integral of f of x dx is going to

10:43:39.320 --> 10:43:50.320
be equal to that capital F of x plus a constant. That integral sign tells us find the anti-derivative.

10:43:51.320 --> 10:44:01.040
And just like we have a bunch of derivative rules like the derivative off to the side

10:44:01.040 --> 10:44:08.580
here, like if we want the derivative of x squared that's equal to 2x. We've got those

10:44:08.580 --> 10:44:17.160
derivative rules. We also have integral rules as well. And we have one for powers, the power

10:44:17.480 --> 10:44:29.480
rule. The power rule says the integral of x to any exponent dx is equal to, well let's

10:44:29.480 --> 10:44:35.880
see if we can piece this together. The derivative makes the exponent shrink by one, so we need

10:44:35.880 --> 10:44:42.980
the exponent to go up by one. Of course the derivative says the exponent is multiplied

10:44:42.980 --> 10:44:50.500
out front, so we're going to divide by that new exponent. And with integrals there's

10:44:50.500 --> 10:45:01.500
always a plus c. This is the power rule, a useful formula to be able to use quite quickly.

10:45:02.420 --> 10:45:07.300
And just like we use the power rule with derivatives a lot, we're going to use the power rule with

10:45:07.300 --> 10:45:17.160
integrals a lot. There's actually a whole lot of integral rules. Just to give you a

10:45:17.160 --> 10:45:27.660
taste here, this table is copied out of your textbook. So, I'll put a number 2 here maybe,

10:45:27.780 --> 10:45:48.780
c textbook for more integral rules. And this table is in 4.10 and you can see this table,

10:45:49.780 --> 10:45:54.960
and it kind of takes the differentiation formula which we're familiar with and does it backwards

10:45:54.980 --> 10:46:04.480
with an integration formula. The second one is the power rule that we just solved. So there's

10:46:04.480 --> 10:46:12.280
lots of formulas in there, but we're going to focus mainly on the power rule. Let's see

10:46:12.280 --> 10:46:30.880
if we can find the integral of 7x cubed minus 5x squared plus 2x minus 7 dx. We'll take

10:46:30.880 --> 10:46:39.380
this one term at a time. With the 7x cubed, we keep the 7, the constant out front, the

10:46:39.380 --> 10:46:50.380
x cubed goes up to 4, and then we divide by that new exponent. Then we have minus 5x

10:46:50.380 --> 10:46:57.200
squared, now it goes up because we're doing the antiderivative, goes up to 3, and we divide

10:46:57.200 --> 10:47:07.140
by that exponent. Plus 2x, we increase the exponent by 1, so now it's squared, and we

10:47:07.160 --> 10:47:16.160
divide by the exponent. Minus 7, increase the exponent by 1, right now it was x to the

10:47:16.160 --> 10:47:21.900
zero, that's why it's not there. Increase it by 1, we have x to the first, and we divide

10:47:21.900 --> 10:47:29.400
by 1. We don't really need to say the divide by 1, but the 2 over 2 does reduce, and so

10:47:29.400 --> 10:47:40.220
our final integral is 7x to the fourth over 4, minus 5x to the third over 3, plus x squared

10:47:40.220 --> 10:47:48.320
minus 7x, and don't forget, we always need with integrals and antiderivatives, a plus

10:47:48.320 --> 10:47:59.320
c. We can use the power rule to even integrate some more interesting looking things.

10:47:59.780 --> 10:48:10.120
Like for instance, the integral of x cubed minus 2 times the fourth root of x over x

10:48:10.120 --> 10:48:21.520
squared dx. Now to help us out here, we're going to massage the function a little bit

10:48:21.520 --> 10:48:28.120
to make it something we can use in our power rule. One thing we can do because of the minus

10:48:28.120 --> 10:48:34.000
in there is we can distribute the divide by x squared onto both parts, so we actually

10:48:34.000 --> 10:48:42.680
have the integral of x cubed over x squared minus 2, and let's change that fourth root

10:48:42.680 --> 10:48:58.320
to an exponent, x to the one fourth over x squared dx. Well we can continue to simplify

10:48:58.320 --> 10:49:10.320
by subtracting exponents. x cubed over x squared is just x minus 2x to the one fourth

10:49:10.320 --> 10:49:17.880
minus 2. Well 2 is eight fourths, so one fourth minus eight fourths is negative seven fourths

10:49:17.880 --> 10:49:27.520
power dx. Moving up to give us a little more room, let's take the derivative now, or the

10:49:27.520 --> 10:49:36.360
integral, for the x, we raise the exponent by 1 to get x squared, and divide by 2 minus

10:49:36.360 --> 10:49:46.300
2x, and then we raise the exponent by 1, or four fourths, to get negative three fourths,

10:49:46.300 --> 10:49:54.880
and divide by the new exponent of negative three fourths. Of course there's going to

10:49:54.880 --> 10:50:01.160
be a plus c at the end, never forget the plus c. Cleaning up a little bit, we've got a negative

10:50:01.680 --> 10:50:08.160
that makes it positive. Dividing by a fraction means multiplying by the reciprocal, so let's

10:50:08.160 --> 10:50:18.480
multiply by four thirds instead. So we have x squared over 2, plus 2 times 4 is 8, negative

10:50:18.480 --> 10:50:28.520
exponent moves it down, x to the three fourths, plus a constant, and so we have x squared

10:50:28.520 --> 10:50:42.520
over 2, plus 8x, 8 over 3x to the three fourths, plus our constant. Let's try one more. Let's

10:50:42.520 --> 10:50:58.260
see if we can do a trig one. The integral of cosine of 3x dx. Now I know the antiderivative

10:50:58.260 --> 10:51:04.760
of cosine, or what's going to give me cosine when I take the derivative, that's going to

10:51:04.760 --> 10:51:16.320
be the sine. So I might think maybe sine 3x plus c is my integral, and you'd be very close

10:51:16.320 --> 10:51:21.880
if you said that. But remember the chain rule says if we take the derivative of sine of

10:51:21.880 --> 10:51:29.880
x, the derivative of sine of 3x would be cosine of 3x times the derivative of the inside,

10:51:29.880 --> 10:51:38.680
which would be times three. So we have to undo that times three, and the best way to

10:51:38.680 --> 10:51:49.440
undo times three is to divide by three. So the integral or antiderivative of cosine 3x

10:51:49.440 --> 10:51:59.680
is the sine of 3x divided by three, plus a constant. Take a look at some of these in

10:51:59.680 --> 10:52:04.400
the assignment as you practice a few of these. These antiderivatives or integrals are really

10:52:04.400 --> 10:52:10.040
about pattern recognition. Trying something out and seeing that's close, how can I adjust

10:52:10.040 --> 10:52:16.380
to get closer until you get something that is correct? In Calc 2 we'll talk about a lot

10:52:16.380 --> 10:52:20.480
of strategies to make some of this easier, but for now we want to kind of get some exposure

10:52:20.480 --> 10:52:27.600
and some experience with integrals and antiderivatives. So take a few of these, and we will see you

10:52:27.600 --> 10:52:30.120
in class to discuss them further.
