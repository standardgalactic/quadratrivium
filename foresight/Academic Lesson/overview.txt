 Certainly! Let's summarize the process of finding antiderivatives (indefinite integrals) for the functions given in the examples:

1. **Rational Functions**: When dealing with rational functions, we often combine terms with similar denominators and then apply the power rule to each term separately. For example, if we have 7x^4/x^2 - 5x^3/x^3 + 2x^2/x over a differential dx, we would:
   - Combine like terms (in this case, there are no like terms).
   - Apply the power rule to each term.
   - Remember that any x^0 term is equal to 1, so it can be dropped unless necessary for clarity.
   - The result will be an expression of the form (7x^4/4) - (5x^3/3) + (2x^2/1) + C, where C represents the constant of integration.

2. **Combining Terms**: Sometimes we need to combine terms with different powers of x by adjusting exponents. For instance, in the integral of x^3 - 2(x^(1/4))/x^2 dx, we changed the fourth root to an exponent (1/4) and combined the terms over a common denominator.
   - We then applied the power rule to each term separately.
   - After integrating, we got x^2/(2) - (8/3)(x^(3/4)) + C.

3. **Trigonometric Functions**: When dealing with trigonometric functions like sine and cosine, we need to remember the chain rule. For example, to find the antiderivative of cos(3x) dx, we know that the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). Thus:
   - We apply the chain rule, which means taking the derivative of the inside function times the derivative of the outside function.
   - In this case, the derivative of the inside function (3x) is 3, and applying the chain rule gives us sin(3x) * 3 dx.
   - After integrating cos(3x) dx, we get (1/3)sin(3x) + C.

In each case, after finding the antiderivative, we always add a constant of integration, denoted as C, to account for all possible antiderivatives that differ by a constant. This is because the integral of a function over an interval is unique up to an additive constant. Practice these examples and others like them to become more comfortable with finding antiderivatives.
